First , a teenage girl flashed me at a Marilyn Manson concert . I had agreed to take Vee , my daughter , only reluctantly ; I did n't want to spring for a pair of twenty-five-dollar tickets and take her to the civic center way over in Roanoke for the concert . I did n't know much about fourteen-year-olds ' music , but I knew enough that there was no way I was going to let her go alone  --  and it was either that or tie her down . So I found myself at a Marilyn Manson concert , and while I was there among several hundred tough-guy teens waiting for the show to begin , this girl flashed me . <p> She could n't have been more than fifteen . She wore a bright red choker . I was standing a few feet away from Vee , at the edge of a crowd that thickened into a knot of bodies near the front of the stage  --  which appeared to be about a mile and a half away . I must have looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms crossed over my chest , watching the crowd intently , my eyes going back and forth from Vee to the intermittent spectacle of someone lifted over the throng and passed along on waves of hands until he or she fell , usually head first , into a gap in the tight surface of bodies . I 'm six three , 280 pounds , built solid . I 've always worked out , since I was a boy in Brooklyn and discovered I could avoid trouble if I looked like only a fool would mess with me . The kids were keeping their distance and looking else-where  --  except for this one girl . She was about eight feet away , her back to the stage ; and she looked right through me , the line of her vision crossing my body about neck level . The way her eyes were focused , it was like I was n't there , though she could n't help but see me . She was looking at me . She had short hair , a thin , attractive face , and a lanky body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the word HOLE in plain white lettering enclosed in a white circle . Baggy pants she seemed to swim in . A dazed , I'm-not-here look in her eyes . <p> We stood there , she with her hands thrust deep in her pockets , I with my arms crossed over my chest . We were two points of silence in a mass of squeals and shouts that coalesced to a hollow din . I had just looked away from her , back toward Vee . I was feeling an uncomfortably familiar anxiety , one I had n't felt in a while , but had almost every waking moment in Vietnam ; a pervasive sense of danger somewhere within what I was seeing but invisible to me , as if the source were going to suddenly materialize and I had better be looking in the right place when it did . I could n't quit scanning , searching . When I turned back toward the girl , she pushed her pants down to mid-thigh and pulled them up again quickly  --  and then just remained there staring through me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure it happened at all , but the image burned itself instantly into my memory . She wore black panties that narrowed to strings across her hips and contrasted sharply with her fair skin . The triangle of black fabric was pulled to one side and ran in a dark line down the center of a sunny thatch of blond hair . My mind reacted to the sight like a strip of film . She was both the camera snapping the picture and the picture itself . I registered the image , and it remains burned in place to this moment . <p> I wondered if she expected me to do something . I had turned fifty the week before . She was a child . I looked into her eyes . Her gaze remained blank as she backed into the crowd and disappeared . <p> Vee approached me . " Do you have to just stand here like this ? " Her face was bunched tight with anger , her lips a thin line , her eyes squinting . <p> " Deal 's a deal , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the concert as long as I came with her . She could stand with the crowd rather than sit in the stands , as long as I was nearby and she stayed near the edge . No going anywhere near the mosh pit . This was , after all , a band in which every performer was named after a serial killer . I said , " Just pretend I 'm not here . " <p> " Right , " she spit out , and stomped away . <p> A moment later the lights went down , and an evening of almost unbearable sound commenced . I could n't believe the volume of the music . Literally , it was shocking . The sound pummeled me , every thump of the bass a jab to the body . Relentless , overwhelming sound . After three hours , I was exhausted  --  and pissed off . When the lights finally went up and the general din resumed , I headed for the exit with Vee , who seemed to have forgotten momentarily how upset she was that I had insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , like all the other kids filing out of the civic center in a thick stream of dyed hair and pierced body parts . She floated along a few steps in front of me , and I could see her searching the crowd , hoping to find someone she knew , someone with whom she could share her excitement . <p> Then the next thing happened . <p> A group of three guys and one girl came along , walking against the flow of the crowd , and the girl recognized Vee . She squealed and took Vee by the hand and pulled her out of the line . The boys apparently did n't know Vee . They scowled and stood back and waited . I stepped out of the crowd , and one of the boys looked toward me and our eyes met . The girl was chattering about the concert and embracing Vee , who appeared slightly nervous and awkward . The boy said , " What are you looking at , Fuckhead ? " and then he spit on me . He might have been sixteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost as tall as me , and like many of the boys that night , he was shiftless . He was built wiry and tight . I leapt toward him , and the fool stepped into my punch . One instant he was standing , full of himself ; the next he was out cold on his back , bleeding from the nose and mouth . I grabbed Vee roughly by the arm and pulled her away . <p> Vee never said a word to me that night . Nothing . In the car on the way home she sat in the backseat , silent , for the hour-long drive . I did n't ask her who the girl was . I did n't ask her anything . Something was going on . First a girl flashed me ; then I knocked out a kid , a boy ; and by the time I was sitting in the dark of the car , driving home on a narrow country road under a bright full moon , I knew something was happening . <p> When I first got back from Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me there . Compared to some other guys , to most other guys , I was lucky . I saw some things , yes . And there were images that seemed to hunt me , stalking me and coming vividly to life when I least wanted to see them : the wrecked , bloody face of my lieutenant ; the body of a young woman draped over a tree limb like an article of clothing hung to dry . She was naked . Something happened when I saw her . I came upon her in a small clearing , slanted shafts of sunlight filtering through a porous roof of leaves . I walked right up to her . Her breasts were small , barely developed , the nipples puffy . I could n't help looking at her , noticing the shapeliness of her calves and thighs , my eyes focusing a long moment on her sex . Her throat had been cut in a fat red line from shoulder to shoulder , and there was a circle on the ground where the dirt had soaked up her blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was six months maybe , at the most , that I was messed up , before I got it together . <p> I dealt with it . You can let things destroy you , you can let them eat you alive  --  or you can master them , you can command them . And you can get on with your life . <p> I was twenty-four when I got home . I had been to college ; I had my degree . Useless , granted . In anthropology . A no-name college . But I had finished . I had done my turn in the service . Six months , maybe , I was a mess , before I met June , my first wife , and put my life together . I got a decent job with the phone company , which turned into a decent career . With June 's work , we made enough money to get a nice house . We did OK . I did OK . The marriage did n't last , but I 'm not alone there . At least we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months , though ... It feels like I spent most of them driving . I could n't get myself together . I just could n't . Nights , I 'd wake up at four A.M. Every night , weeks in a row . Most nights , my stomach would be aching , a deep , generalized pain , a cramp that would n't let go . I 'd take a shower and let the hot water run over my chest and stomach . I can see myself in that narrow box , which was lined with white tiles and had a bright light that shone into it so that my memory of it is this bright vision : my pink , naked body , the wide bulk of it leaning back so that the top of my head touched the tiles and the pulsing stream hit my belly . I 'd writhe under the hot water . It helped , but not enough . Eventually I 'd dry off and dress and get in the car and drive till the pain finally stopped , which usually took three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands . <p> After I married June , I never had another four A.M. stomachache . They just stopped . I had gotten my life going again . I was back on track . Things went well with my job . I got raises and promotions . If I ask myself now whether I was happy then , I ca n't answer . I think I was happy . I know I was n't tortured anymore by Vietnam , which I came to think of as a place where my life had gotten derailed for a brief time . I got past it . Even when June left me , I handled it OK . She had gotten involved with a consciousness-raising group . They thought of themselves as feminists . I thought of them as a group of angry , unhappily married women , and I was upset and worried when June took up with them . Turned out I was right to be worried . Suddenly I was getting the whole antimale litany , night after night : I was uncommunicative , un-responsive , an insensitive lover , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's married again and has two boys . She sent me a picture once . Her husband wore a yellow ascot . <p> But a couple of months after she left , I met Marcy , and everything was back on track again . <p> The night of the concert , Vee fell asleep sobbing . Marcy and I could hear her from our bedroom , where we lay side by side , rigid and awake , both of us looking at the ceiling . Vee is our only child . Marcy could n't believe I had knocked out a high-school kid . " You humiliated her , " she had said when I told her . <p> My stomach hurt . It was a warm night , mid-May . The windows were open ; the ceiling fan revolved lethargically . Marcy lay beside me with her eyes open . She 's a big woman , almost as tall as me . She 's vulnerable and acutely sensitive at times , which is precisely how she does n't look . She appears to be stern and angry . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry that makes her look this way . She worries about everything . <p> When Vee finally stopped sobbing , Marcy said : " She just wants to be alive . She just wants to live her life . " <p> " Really ? " I turned on my side and leaned close to her . " The kid spit on me , " I said . " He spit on me . " <p> Marcy crossed her arms over her eyes . She turned away . <p> I hovered over her , and I realized my hand was clenched into a fist . I wanted to hit her . I had never struck a woman , and yet I knew what I was feeling . I wanted to grab her by the throat . I wanted to hurt her , and the desire to do so swelled within me like something wild that needed to be turned loose . <p> I slid away , got out of bed . I put on clothes and went out the sliding glass door to our bedroom deck . The air was still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our deck looks out over a line of suburban backyards : maple trees , elms , basswoods , oaks , all surrounded by neatly mown grass , picket fences , red-brick patios and walkways . Our nearest neighbor had just put a stone bench under the oak in the center of his yard , with an in-ground light illuminating the area . All the houses had sentry lights that stayed on all night , relegating the darkness to corners and the shadows of things . Most nights I would have thought the view was peaceful and quiet , ordered and lovely ; but that night I found the stillness frightening . I was sweating , and I felt like I needed to run . I needed to get out of there . The stillness was suddenly somehow loud . The lack of movement felt like lack of air , felt like I was suffocating . I could n't breathe right . I shook my head and tried to laugh it off , but I found that my eyes were full of tears . I was crying . I was crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the words to explain the intensity of what I felt out there on the deck that night . It was as if this feeling had come out of nowhere , risen up out of the stillness , this terrifying sense , like fear multiplied and squared . I absolutely did not know what was happening . I thought for a moment that I might have been drugged  --  but the only thing I drank at the concert was a Pepsi , and that out of a can . The feeling was huge ; it altered the world . I had this sense that everything I saw was painted on a canvas : the world itself was a painting on a canvas , and I could see it wavering . I could see the corners beginning to curl . I laughed . I wiped tears out of my eyes with the back of my arm . From inside , Marcy called my name . " Jeff ? " she said . " Jeffrey ? " <p> I went into the bedroom and knelt beside her . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I shook my head . <p> " Yes you are , " she said . She wiped a tear off my cheek . <p> " I 'm going for a drive . " <p> " A drive ? " She sat up . She looked startled . " It 's one in the morning ! " <p> I explained as best I could . I told her something was happening , I did n't know what . I needed to get in the car and drive . She tried to dissuade me . She tried to get me back into bed . She would n't let go of my arm until I yanked it away from her . Then I took my wallet from the night table and the car keys from the hook by the kitchen window , and I drove away with Marcy standing in a pool of yellow light outside our front door , her hands clasped together as if in prayer . <p> Friday evening found me sleeping fitfully in an Atlanta hotel . I had driven through the night without much thought to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up I was in Georgia , following the signs to Atlanta . In the car , in the dark , driving in the company of massive tractor-trailers , I had cried for a few hours before falling into the soothing , hypnotic trance of long-term driving . I did n't know why I was crying . I did n't know what I was doing . I was just driving , moving . In the morning I thought about stopping to call home , but I did n't know yet what I would say . I thought I might have had an anxiety attack out on the deck . I thought that might explain it . Something about the concert  --  the overwhelming noise , the girl dropping her pants , my hitting that kid  --  had brought it on . I needed to ride it out . I 'd be fine . And by the time I drove into Atlanta , I was feeling a lot better , though still shaky . I got off on an exit that led to Spring Street , and Spring Street led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , where I checked in and took a room on the twenty-first floor . <p> The key to my room was a card with a magnetic strip . When I slid it through a slot on the door handle , a green light came on , and the door unlocked . Inside I found a massive bed and a writing table , and a back wall that was all glass and led out to a narrow balcony overlooking the city . I stood on the balcony a while and gazed upon the cityscape : the intertwining strips of highway clogged with morning traffic , the array of tall buildings , including one that looked like a spaceship perched atop a column . It reminded me of something out of the Jetsons . I felt good out on the balcony , a dry breeze ruffling my hair . I was definitely feeling better . There was nothing of the panic from the night before . I went back inside and pulled the curtain , darkening the room . I stripped and got into the bed . In a few moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , it was dark again ; and when I opened the curtains , I found a nighttime panorama . The spaceship building was a soft blue circle surrounded by the glittering lights of the skyline . Long lines of red and white tail- and headlights moved along the highways . Twenty-one floors up , the noise of traffic was the principal sound : a loud , windy rush . As I stood on the balcony watching and listening , I felt as though I were waking from a very long sleep . And I was just waking from several hours of restless sleep  --  but it felt like something more than that . It felt like Rip Van Winkle . I said aloud , " Sleepy Hollow . " Then I thought about Marcy and Vee , and for a moment I was out-and-out shocked at myself , at what I 'd done , getting in the car and driving away from them , abandoning them . What could they be thinking ? I wondered if they might not have called the police by now . In seventeen years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and then I just up and disappear . What could they be thinking ? What was I thinking ? <p> I went back into my room , sliding the glass door closed behind me , shutting out the traffic noise and replacing it with the loud drone of a fan . I sat on the bed and picked up the phone , intending to call home , intending to apologize to Marcy , intending to explain that something had happened to me , something I did n't understand . I had panicked and fallen back on an old habit of driving , and I had wound up here in Atlanta , in this hotel where I was calling from , and everything would be OK , would be fine , I 'd be home again in a few hours . I was sorry . I was very sorry . I picked up the phone , carefully read the directions . I punched 8 for an outside line ; then I hit 1 ; then I entered my area code ; but by the time I got to my number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was happening , this wave that had picked me up and was carrying me along . I put the phone back in the cradle . I straightened myself out and left the room . Then I was back in my car and driving around downtown Atlanta . <p> The evening was just beginning . Men and women strolled along city streets , looking like they were n't going anywhere in particular . I guessed because of the hour that most of them were heading to dinner somewhere , some restaurant . I drove around for a couple of hours , looking . At one point I found myself driving through a series of poorly lit , empty streets , a place in the center of the city but hidden away somehow : useless reality , back streets , back entrances to buildings . I was driving slowly , had been driving slowly all evening . I probably looked like I was cruising , looking for action , because a man walked out of the shadows in front of the car and motioned me to stop . He was dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright yellow jacket . He was an explosion of color walking out of the dark , and it was n't hard to guess what he would offer if I stopped : drugs or sex , sex or drugs . I did n't stop . I drove past him , and when I came to an entrance ramp , I took it . <p> The highway was thick with traffic . I imagined someone looking down at me from a hotel balcony : now I was one of the gliding lines of red and white lights . I drove for a half-hour , forty-five minutes , and then exited , meaning to turn around and head back to the city , maybe back to the hotel . I was thinking that I had to call Marcy . I had to at least let her know I was OK , even if I could n't tell her what I was doing because I did n't yet know myself . I could at least call her . I could at least try to explain . I drove by a shopping plaza where two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a long , windowless building that looked like a factory or a bowling alley . The parking lot in front was crowded . Along the curb , there was a line of motorcycles . While I watched , the police put two guys into the back of a car and drove away . A small group of young men in tuxedos walked through a thick red door into the white building . Over the door , in red neon script , were the words : The Gentleman 's Club . I pulled into the lot . One of the tuxedos came back out and stood alongside the door with his arms crossed . <p> I guessed it was a strip bar , a club with exotic dancers , girls who stood on your table and took off their clothes while you gawked . Why I pulled into the lot then , why I parked and got out of the car and started for the entrance , was a mystery to me . I was n't especially interested in sex . I had n't been in many years . In high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the late ' 60s , sex seemed all anyone was interested in : it was as if the whole nation entered adolescence simultaneously . Sex this and sex that , on television , in movies , in books and magazines . I slept with several women then , though I could n't recall many particulars . It had been almost thirty years . A couple years into my first marriage , desire just about disappeared . June and I had sex maybe once every couple months , and then it was fast and , as June loudly complained years later , unsatisfying . With Marcy , the lack of much desire for sex was one of the things that made us compatible . Ever since Vee was born , it had been a once-in-a-blue-moon thing . <p> So why was I stopping at a sex club ? I did n't know . Best I could make out , it was like a wave I was riding , and that was where it took me . I walked past the guy in the tuxedo , who nodded pleasantly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing I had ever seen . I felt as though I had walked through a crack in the culture 's armor and wound up in a place where all the rules were in suspension : the place was Dionysian , Bacchanalian . Music screamed . Women stood on tabletops , naked or on their way to being naked . More women strutted around the barroom . In a far corner , elevated a few feet above the crowd , a black mechanical bull bucked and swayed , impaled on a silvery hydraulic tube , ridden by a woman dressed only in her skin and a mane of waist-length red hair that flew around her with the gyrations of the bull . When I first saw the bull and the woman , I stopped and gaped . I think my mouth might have actually been hanging open . While I watched , a boy climbed up and handed some bills to a guy in a tuxedo , and the bull stopped bucking for a moment while the boy settled himself in the saddle . The dancer stood in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the saddle , her waist at the level of the boy 's head . A large group of young men began to yowl and hoot , and then the bull began to buck , tossing the boy forward and back . With each forward toss , the dancer thrust her pelvis toward the boy , who was pulled away from her by the motion of the bull ; and with each backward toss , the boy would lunge for her sex , his mouth open , while she expertly kept herself inches away . The more the bull bucked , the louder the crowd yowled . <p> I watched for a while , until the pure shock of what I was seeing dissipated , and then I made my way toward the bar , above which a woman was swinging on a trapeze suspended from the ceiling , taking off her clothes one article at a time and tossing them down onto the bartender to the amusement of the drinkers . I stood for several minutes behind a guy with a Semper Fidelis tattoo on his bicep , until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took my order for a drink . She explained that all the tables were currently occupied , but as soon as one was available , I could take a seat . A dancer would come and perform for me . Until then I could stand and watch or I could sit and watch . She pointed to a line of cushioned benches that ran along one wall . When she walked away , I saw that she was wearing a thong . I watched her until she was out of sight , then carried my drink to the back of the room and took a seat on a bench . <p> I observed the scene  --  attractive women walking around in various degrees of nakedness ; mostly very young men , boys really , shouting and waving bills at the women , who came to them and let them place the bills under garters ; naked women gyrating on tabletops , swinging from trapezes , riding mechanical bulls  --  with an attitude somewhere between numbed shock and amusement . I did n't know what I was doing there , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a drink . In a minute , I thought , I 'd get back in my car and drive to the hotel , and I 'd call Marcy and tell her I was coming home . I took a sip of my drink , about to put it on the floor , slide it under the bench , and head out ; and then I noticed that across from me , maybe ten feet away , where a dozen guys were sitting in a line on the bench , there was a waitress . I assumed she was a waitress because she was wearing the same tuxedo outfit as the girl from whom I had ordered my drink . She had a cute , girlish face , with short dark hair cut in a bob , and she sat on the bench with the line of men , chatting with the guy next to her . A girl dressed in jeans and a T-shirt sat on the floor at her feet , between her open legs . While the waitress chatted with the guy , the girl on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's head , she appeared to be licking the waitress . Every once in a while she 'd stop , and she too would talk with the guy , as if taking a momentary break from what she was doing to throw in a few words of conversation . This was so strange it shook me up . I began to feel frightened and anxious again  --  because I found it hard to believe that what I was watching was actually happening . Now and again the waitress would close her eyes and throw her head back against the wall and hold the girl 's head in her hands , pulling her deeper between her legs . This was in a crowded barroom . This was with scores of people milling around . Part of me wanted to cross the room and touch them , just to see if they were real . Instead , I put my drink on the floor and walked casually out of the bar . <p> Outside , I felt wildly disoriented . I stepped into the spring air , out of the wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like any suburban mall anywhere , and for a moment I could n't remember where I was ; and before it came back to me-Atlanta , The Gentleman 's Club , the hotel  --  I was pale and sweaty and nauseated . In the car , back on the highway , the feeling evolved into fear as intense as it was at home the night before on my bedroom deck . My arms were stiff , and my body was tight and cramped . I drove back to my hotel and got undressed and lay a long while naked under the covers . I was sweating . There was something physical going on inside me . I did n't know what it was . Through the glass I could hear the muffled sound of the traffic , like a reminder : you 're in Atlanta ; you 're not at home , and I 'd have to think to remember how I got where I was . I felt as though I were coming apart , as though something inside me was unraveling , something that had once been wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , willing my mind blank , before the fear began to dissipate . It happened slowly . It ebbed out of me . It left me feeling opened up and vulnerable . I was wide awake . It was a little after one in the morning . I told myself that I was having an episode of craziness . That was the only way to explain it . An episode of weirdness . I wished it were n't happening , but it was . I 'd figure it out . I 'd handle it . I 'd ride it out , and then I 'd get it together again , the way I always had , the way I knew I could . I kicked off the blankets and turned on the light , and I was startled by the sight of my naked body stretched out on the bed . It must have been a very long time since I had looked at myself naked . I felt as though I were confronting a stranger . My body was pale and doughy , an unhealthy hue of white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers into the thick mat of hair that surrounded my penis . The room was bright . The sheets were white . I touched my eyes and my temples and my cheeks , as if I were a blind man trying to recognize someone . I touched my knees and my thighs and the place under my scrotum where my legs came together . I held my scrotum in the palm of my hand , and my penis rose quickly , stiff and hard , and I looked at it swollen there against my stomach with something like a sense of wonder . I could n't remember the last time I had masturbated . Not in years , many years . I sat on the edge of the bed and pondered the possibility of masturbating like a man considering the terms of a difficult equation ; and while I thought about it , the erection disappeared . <p> I went out on the balcony . I stayed there a long time , naked , looking over the city . It 's awfully hard to explain this . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was trying to find the right turn . It 's like there was a problem set before me , and I was experimenting with solutions . Only I did n't understand the problem . I could n't see the maze . I knew I had to do something . I had no idea why or what . People out of their minds talk about wires implanted in their heads , controlling them , making them do stuff . That 's what it was like . I was not in control . Things were moving me ; I felt like a marionette  --  but in some way I knew that I myself was the hand pulling the strings making me move . I went into the room , and the way I remember what happened next is this : I sat on the bed , intending to call Marcy , to call home . I hesitated , trying to figure out what I would say , how I would explain myself to Marcy and Vee , and while I was hesitating , I pulled out the night-table drawer , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I opened it at random and found myself looking through several pages of advertisements for escort services . Now , this seems hard to believe , the way so much of what happened seems incredible to me now . But that 's how I remember it . I opened the Yellow Pages , and I was looking at ads for escort services . <p> The one I called wanted to know where I needed an escort at three in the morning . I said it was a private party . I said it was in my hotel room . When she asked what kind of an escort I wanted , I said young . When she asked how she should dress , I said casual . I said jeans and a T-shirt would do . I said thin is preferable . I said she does n't have to have much in the way of breasts . She laughed . There 's a switch , she said . Then we worked out the payment . I gave her my credit card number . When I hung up , I went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dressed , and a half-hour later my escort arrived . I opened the door in response to her knock . She took one look at me , and a smirk crossed her face . She made a sound somewhere between a snort and a laugh , then sauntered past me into the room . She said , " Not much for formalities , are you ? " She gestured toward the door , which I was holding open , and the look on her face said Well ? Are you going to close it ? I closed the door and leaned back against it , and for a moment we just looked each other over . I asked for young , and they sent young : she looked to be in her early twenties . She was small , maybe five three , five four at the most , with heavy , round breasts that pushed against the fabric of a black , official Disney World Minnie Mouse T-shirt . Minnie was pictured in bright red and white , her arms akimbo and look of reproach on her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first I was upset about the size of her breasts  --  but it passed . <p> I cleared my throat . I did n't know what to say . I was standing there naked in front of a stranger , and I remember that I did n't feel awkward at all . I looked into her eyes . She had a face that would have been beautiful if it were n't marred by toughness , by an orneriness that made her look as though she might turn her head and spit on the floor at any moment . She had short black hair that lay flat over her forehead and angled down toward the back of her neck , barely covering her ears . She had dark eyes and a round face . She stood with her arms crossed under her breasts and one knee bent , adding to her I'm-tough , I've-seen-every-thing look . All she needed was a toothpick between her teeth to complete the image . " Well , " she said , her voice gentler than her appearance , " at least I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent . I could n't tell if she was putting it on or not . She said , " Where are you from , honey ? " She sat on the bed and started to take off her shoes , which were sneakers , white . Nikes . When I did n't answer , she went on . " You know , " she said , " what you want will be another 250 in cash . That 's over what you 've already paid . " She paused then , watching me , one leg crossed over the other , holding a sneaker dangling from her finger by its heel . <p> I said , " What is it I want ? " I thought she might know something I did n't . <p> She made that laugh-snort sound again . She said , " You have the money , darling ? It has to be cash . " <p> I shook my head . I did n't . I did n't have anywhere near 250 in cash . <p> She put her sneaker back on . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you paid , I 'll go have a cup of coffee with you . <p> That 's all . " " That 's OK , " I said . " You can go . I do n't know why I called . " <p> She looked perplexed . " Honey , " she said . " You 're stark raving naked . Why do you think you called ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " You can just go ahead and go . " I walked past her , toward the balcony . When I slid open the glass door , she said " Wait , " and she got up from the bed and touched my arm . I stopped . I stood in the open door with a breeze blowing comfortably against my bare skin . <p> " What ? " I said . " You can go . I 'm sorry I called . Honestly . I do n't know why I did . " I covered my eyes with my hands . I sighed . " I 'm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having some kind of period of craziness or something . " I rubbed my eyes . " You can go , " I said . " Really . I 'm sorry . " <p> She stepped back and looked me over . She seemed partly annoyed and partly troubled . She said , " Do you ... Is it that ... I mean , do you like women to see you naked ? " <p> I shook my head . <p> " I did n't think so . " She looked down . " You do n't appear especially excited . " <p> " Go ahead and go , " I said . " I 'm sorry ... " I looked down at myself . " I 'm sorry I 'm naked , " I said . I gestured toward the door , and then I turned my back on her and went out on the balcony . <p> I stepped to the railing , grasped the wrought iron in my hands . I was looking down . At the moving lines of red and white lights . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark in the moonlight . <p> She came out on the balcony behind me . She took my arm in her hand and pulled me toward her , turning me around to face her . She lost the southern accent . " Honey , " she said . " You 're not going to do anything crazy , are you ? " She said , " You 're not thinking about jumping or anything , are you ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm not thinking about jumping . " My voice was shaky . <p> She took my arm . She touched me gently . " What is it with men ? " she said . " What happens to you guys ? " She touched my cheek . " Come here , " she said . She stepped into me . She put one of my hands on her back and held it there , then put my other arm around her shoulder . " Dance with me a while , " she said . " It 'll make you feel better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held me in her arms , and her body began to sway , moving gently side to side . <p> I only resisted for a moment . Then I leaned into her . <p> " I like dancing , " she whispered . She touched the back of my neck with her fingertips . " Dancing always makes me feel better . " <p> I tried to say something in response , but I could n't talk . <p> " That 's OK , " she said . " Just dance with me . " <p> I did . We danced an hour or more , silent at first but then talking a bit back and forth . By the time she left , the Atlanta night was fading into paleness , and the outlines of buildings were emerging from the dark . She told me her name was Sally . She told me she had two children , the first when she was fourteen . She told me that she loved dancing  --  just standing someplace alone and swaying to whatever music she could conjure . Something about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed and fell asleep soundly . <p> When I finally got home , no one was there . I had driven back to Virginia through downpours and thunder . In North Carolina , with dusk coming on , I saw a lightning bolt hit a telephone pole , sending pieces of a transformer sailing in flames . By the time I pulled up in front of my house , it was late , and there had n't been a storm for a while , but the wind was still gusting the way it does in thunderstorms : quiet for a time , then building and building right to the edge of being frightening . It did n't take me a second to figure out no one was home . There were no lights on . The driveway was empty . I had taken off and disappeared for thirty-six hours without so much as a phone call . I figured Marcy was in Alexandria with her sister . I could see her there at the kitchen table with her sister and her sister 's husband , and her parents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents , who lived two houses over . They were all close . We had all once been close . I imagined them sitting around the table , talking : a family conference , the proffering of support and love . Vee would be upstairs with her cousin . There 'd be music on . She 'd probably still be talking about the concert . <p> Once inside , I wandered through the house , going from room to room , picking up things here and there  --  a knickknack , a picture , a book  --  and looking it over as if it held a secret I had forgotten . I opened the fridge and rummaged through it , rearranging bottles and red and blue food containers . I found an unopened plastic bottle of water . I broke off the cap , then held the bottle over my lips and squeezed it , shooting a jet of spring water into the back of my mouth . It tasted good . I took another long drink and carried the bottle with me to my bedroom , where I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope on my pillow . It was beige , same color as the bedspread . It blended in . Had I turned on the lights , I would have seen it right away . But I had n't . The house was mostly dark . <p> I did n't open the envelope right away . I knew there would be a letter inside . I figured I knew most of what it would say . As soon as I walked into the house , I knew that everything had changed . I could feel it . Like an emptiness . In one sense it was sudden . In another , it was a long time coming . I went out on the balcony and stood in the gusting wind . I left the door open , and the wind blew into the house . I could hear curtains rustling . In another room , a door slammed . I was just beginning to have the faintest glimmering of what was happening to me . Now that I 've gone back over things many times , I have some better ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt as if I were closing in on something , as if the first pieces of a puzzle were about to fall into place . I knew it started with the concert , with the girl , and I reviewed what had happened , picturing her , and it occurred to me then that I might have imagined the incident . Not imagined it : hallucinated it . It occurred to me that I might have created her  --  though I can still see her image vividly . She was like a switch that triggered the whole episode . I thought I might have taken down that girl from her tree in Vietnam , clothed and altered her and placed her among the concert crowd . She would have been the right age . I thought , maybe , twenty-five years ago her naked body was like a switch that turned off something inside me . Maybe . I thought , twenty-five years later she returned . I 'd believe she was a ghost , if I believed in ghosts , which I do n't . But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Think of how silent she was . Her small breasts . Her red necklace like the tattoo of a wound . <p> I wanted to push the notion out of my mind , and for a time , that night , I did . I got rid of it . It was a crazy idea . I had nothing to do with that girl 's body winding up draped over a tree limb  --  or no more at least than anyone else who was alive at the time . As far as what happened to her was concerned , I might as well have not been there . I might as well have been protesting the war in front of the Pentagon . I had nothing to do with it . I was n't there when it happened . I had no idea who did it or why . It was just something I saw . I was on patrol , and I saw it , and that was all . I had no more direct involvement than some hippie in San Francisco , some priest in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ever paid taxes , or shopped in a supermarket , or laid down fifty bucks for a pair of jeans . I would have stopped it if I could . I was n't there when it happened . It was just something I saw , passing by . <p> But seeing it did something to me . That much was clear . That much , out on the balcony that night , I accepted . It was like the first piece of a puzzle had fallen into place . I 'm still working on it . It 's a puzzle about the body  --  my body , that girl 's . There 's a connection . It 's not about guilt or responsibility , though that 's there , that 's one of the pieces . But it 's something different , it 's something more . My hand and hers . My throat and her throat . Our bodies . The music did something to me : the volume and the intensity . The violence did something , my punching that boy . I did n't understand then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in my empty house , when I first realized I might have hallucinated the girl at the concert , it was electric , sparks were snapping inside me . The wind gusted , blew through the house . For a moment I sensed the beginning of fear : it was like a fist closing around my heart . Instead of running , I let my body rock a little bit . I let it sway . That helped . That made things better . In Atlanta , while I danced with Sally , the city blazed around us , the blue light on the skyline turning lazily , the red lights of the cars merging into a glistening line that looped and spun . When we turned , the stars and the moon whirled . At one point in our dancing , I pressed my lips to Sally 's hair and whispered that I loved her . It was crazy , I knew it . Immediately I said , " I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . " She rubbed my back . She kept dancing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's OK . " She kissed my chest . I held her . I held her tightly , and I blessed her . I blessed her and begged her forgiveness , holding her tightly as we danced . <p> <p> By EDWARD FALCO <p>
