The world at large is not in the habit of regarding the German question as a laughing matter . The pundits view it with the utmost gravity ; they can , of course , draw on abundant evidence from the past to justify their alarm . It is not for me to quarrel with their pronouncements , but what they fail to see is the ludicrous side of German events . I should like to redress the balance . Granted that the opening of the Berlin Wall was a moment of high drama , but the consequences turned into low comedy almost overnight . <P> In itself , absurdity is hardly a newcomer on the German political scene . For the better part of 30 years , unification had been an article not of faith but of cant . Nobody took it seriously , nobody believed in it , and in the West at least , there was hardly anyone who really wanted it . One Chancellor after another talked about it absentmindedly , rather like an old lady reciting her Rosary , a performance that became even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erich Honecker 's state visit in Bonn in 1987 . <P> As soon as ordinary people from Dresden and Potsdam , wearing tennis shoes and loaded with plastic bags and perambulators , were seen hobbling through the underbrush across the Hungarian border in the fall of 1989 , crowding embassies in Warsaw and trains in Prague , there were raised eyebrows and mixed feelings in Bonn and elsewhere . For there is nothing dearer to the heart of responsible statesmen than stability . Yalta may have had certain drawbacks , but it was an arrangement one had learned to live with  --  and in the end any situation seemed acceptable as long as it was " under control . " Was it not a bit inconsiderate on the part of all those Poles , Hungarians and Czechs , of Charter 77 and all , to rock the boat ? And now even the placid , nondescript East Germans were taking to the streets , without giving a thought to the delicate balance of power prevailing in the Old World , to the problems of NATO , to the risk involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonn was nothing compared with the havoc wrought in East Berlin . In hindsight it is clear that the fall of the Berlin Wall was due not to strategic planning , but to a sudden loss of nerve . A single ambiguous sentence uttered at a press conference , a mere slip of the tongue , was enough to start an avalanche . The unification of Germany was set off not by grand design but by a blunder . <P> The political leaders on both sides were caught off guard . While the " masses " did not lose a moment , organizing a sort of national jumble sale , changing money , swapping rumors , pulling down fences and repairing bridges , the statesmen scurried from summit to summit , looking more and more nonplussed as they poured forth a torrent of declarations , cautionary tales and contingency plans . <P> When they finally came round to understand that they were faced with a fait * accompli , they swallowed their misgivings and tried to regain control . This turned out to be rather difficult , for by now not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . It would have taken a nimble man indeed to handle a problem of such dimensions . Whatever else may be said about Helmut Kohl , he is not known to have a light foot .
