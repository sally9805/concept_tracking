Daniel was already home . " Hi , " he yelled from the kitchen as Em wrestled her overcoat onto a hanger in the overfull front closet . What the hell was he doing ? Breaking rocks on the counter ? " Hi she yelled back , unwinding her scarf . " Annie call ? " <p> Wham . Wham . Wham . " No , " Daniel called bad . Wham . <p> " What are you doing ? " She draped the scarf over a peg inside the closet door . <p> Daniel appeared in the kitchen doorway in a paint-ticked maroon T-shirt and gray sweat pants , barefoot , one of her French kitchen towels , damp and dark and knotted around something , hanging from his hand . " Cracking ice <p> " Daniel ! " She went in to deprive him of the good towel , leaving her laptop and briefcase against the wall by the open closet door . In the kitchen , cracked ice glistened in a red plastic bowl  --  a mound of it . Daniel leaned against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the fridge . " It 's just a kitchen towel , " he said , dearly baffled . <p> " It 's an expensive kitchen towel <p> " Who makes expensive kitchen towels ! " <p> She had n't changed from her work clothes ; she had n't had a glass of wine yet ; she was n't particularly in the mood for Daniel 's offhand inclination to dispute everything in the universe . " Just use this instead ? Okay ? " <p> " Sure , " he said . He twisted a plastic ice tray , dumped the cubes onto the rag , then leaned across to kiss her hello . He seemed in good spirits . She was wary of that . <p> ' I 'm going to change she said , heading out of the kitchen . " Do we have enough wine ? " <p> " What , change now and then change again ! " <p> Em turned at the door to regard her husband with a momentary but intense dislike . His back was to her ; she watched as he folded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked it up , hefted it once , muttered under his breath , " Now , Mr. Leung , you pay the big price , " and started slamming it against the metal counter . Her irritation shaded into a bemused affection ; she might have slipped into a scene from their life three years ago . But the repeated banging was too loud , too harsh . Daniel 's broad shoulders rolled as he slammed the ice down , over and over , no joke , blow after blow . <p> Their bedroom was quiet . It felt sealed off , except for the thump and whine of the December wind off the Hudson against the window . Sealed off , removed from the world , but the bed was unmade , the flowered sheets and blue-striped duvet kicked down at the end , her grandmother 's quilt draped across the director 's chair they 'd bought that summer . If it 's a chair , and we ca n't sit in it , then , um , Em  --  why own it ? Because I want it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green cloth back and seat sun-faded and frayed , the wood as seasoned as driftwood . She loved its indications . It summoned her childhood : Cape Cod summers , her parents desperate to appear as casually well-to-do as practically everyone around them . And why was that nostalgic ! <p> Daniel had come home early and taken a nap , she thought . Not the best sign . Em made the bed before hanging her blazer , stepping out of her skirt , peeling off wretched hose  --  why , if you dealt with money , did you have to wear hose ? Curators could bop around sans hose . Social mystery . She tucked the limp vestiges of the corporate side of museum work into a net hosiery bag , tossed it into the laundry basket , and then , because the task of becoming herself had overwhelmed her , sighed . She began to unbutton her blouse . People would be here soon . They were going to need more wine . <p> " We have six bottles of red and six of that Argentinean chardonnay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against the doorway . He liked to lean against things . Once , she had thought of him as the kind of person who could walk through one of those askew , tilted-floor funhouses casually upright . But the world was n't a funhouse . " Whoa , check it out , " he added as she unhooked her bra . " Red-hot mama . Ouch <p> " What 's with you ? " she asked , lightly . <p> " What can I say ? Just full of love . Oh , and Max called . He claims he 's going to be here , believe it or not <p> " No summer cold ? " <p> " No summer cold . " <p> He came over and put his arms around her from behind , nestling his rough chin into the hollow of her collarbone . <p> " No business trip to Erie ? Car was n't stolen ? " <p> " No business trips , no stolen cars <p> " You should shave . " <p> " I know . Never got around to it this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His arms were warm against her belly , but she laid a hand on his bony wrist , half holding him at bay . " Hi , " he whispered into the tangle of her hair , the whorl of her ear , <p> real greeting , saying home with breath , home . <p> " Mm , " Em said , almost seduced ; but the air in the room was cold . " You 're warm , but I 'm freezing . I 'm all nipply . " <p> " Yes , I see that He let her go , going to stand in front of the window , then sitting on the far side of the bed as she buttoned her blue shirt . A comfort shirt , she 'd had it for years . " Spooky wind , " he said . <p> Thump . A gust against the window . The air in the room tightened . They were high enough that they got the hard wind right off the river . Thump . Daniel reached forward and put his palm to the cold glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained , then dissolved . Was gone . Past his familiar back , nothing but night and the floodlights on the Jersey shore and the wind whining . Daniel murmured , " Let us in , human child ... " <p> " Jesus , Daniel , you 're giving me the creeps <p> " That 's my talent for eerie hokum ( ' <p> He had his legs drawn up and was looking out the window . <p> " What did Max say ? " she asked . <p> " Just that he 's not bringing some woman named Lisette . Another two-week special , from what he said <p> She was n't surprised . Max flickered in and out of women 's lives the same way he flickered in and out of her and Daniel 's life ; but in romance there was only one flicker , and then Max was gone . In friendship there were repeated sightings . Max the mirage . Em brought her duck boots over to the bed and sat down on the edge , then leaned closer to Daniel , reaching out to smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , funny guy , " she said . " Bad day ? " <p> " Strange how you never see anyone down in that courtyard down there : he said . <p> Snow had started to sift down . Eduardo held the door for her , saying , " I got that feeling , bad winter , you know ! " He was sniffing and arching his brows , too , giving a good deal of credence to Daniel 's theory that he spent his breaks coking up in the boiler room . Had she ever imagined a time in her life when she would be positively grateful for a sweetheart Dominican cokehead for <p> doorman ? They sometimes let Eduardo use their phone to order Chinese food for his dinner break ; they were younger than most of the couples in the building . <p> Down on the street , the wind was n't as bad , and the first faint snow had stuck to the sidewalks , miraculously polished and white , settling at intervals into the fine , dark lines of the squares of pavement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking clean for once . Give it five minutes . The blowing snow stung Em 's face . She walked briskly under the arched streetlights up 104th Street towards West End , avoiding the brooding silence of Riverside . Though it was a Friday evening , the streets were comparatively desolate . There was a kind of Indian summer on Fridays in New York , after work and before people went out for the night  --  a time of dressing and making phone calls , or of looking out the window and wishing someone would call , she thought . As she passed the quiet , sheathed cars , hatless , with the snow caught and pointed with light in her hair , an awareness that she still loved Daniel curled up through her unexpectedly ; and at that moment , as she hurried forward , she could feel an almost perfect forgiveness for his furies and depressions , the kind of forgiveness she could never quite seem to summon while she was with him . Maybe the cost was too high in terms of selflessness . Why , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  precious grains of her own life , which he needed . Their life , her life , his life , our life , your life , my life  --  what did you own except loss ? Nothing . She wished she could click her heels together three times and go back to when they 'd been happy more often . <p> When Em crossed 106th , she realized someone was pacing her , and she glanced over just as a voice sang , in a kind of soft-shoe rhythm , " You do n't have to be a Rockefellah to help a little fellah ... " <p> The homeless man was tiny : he barely came up to her shoulder , scuttling along , a wizened , black-bearded figure , with a ridiculous felt thing like a medieval monk 's cap yanked down almost over his eyes . A brown corduroy coat , too light for the weather , the nap flattened with grease , trailed sleeves that came down past his thumbs . He showed her fingertips , chapped but with pale , almost polished nails . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to ignore him . Past the used bookstore on the corner of 105th , crossing the street . Her shadow , following , sang at her . Her boots rutched against wet gravel in the street where the snow had melted . In the middle of the intersection , he stopped , she sensed his presence fall away . She was generous . She gave to several shelters , to several liberal political organizations ; she paid her New York tithe of conscience . She could walk past . " Hey ! " his voice brayed out behind her . " Hey ! You nothing ! You less than me ! Hey ! " She was at the liquor store door . " Hey ! " <p> An older man , coming out , caught the tail end of the beggar 's harangue . An extinguished cigar like the root of some small shrub nestled in the corner of his mouth , above a wet and liverish and distended lower lip ; he held the door for her , enormous in gray cashmere , and winked as she stepped past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he muttered , " fuckin ' charity cases , " his manner so foul she almost said something sharp in response . But then the door was closed , and what would she have said , anyway ? That she would give , that she had given , but that she simply could n't afford to give anymore ? <p> " Guess who 's here ? " Daniel yelled as she let the door slam shut behind her . <p> Max poked his head out from the kitchen . Deep-set dark eyes ; hair cut short , revealing a bony forehead ; his shadowed jutting jaw . <p> " This is a surprise , " she said . He was early . <p> Daniel emerged from the kitchen behind Max , wiping his hands  --  to hell with it , she gave up  --  on the other of the French kitchen towels . He tossed the cloth on the couch as he went by , and took the bag from her arms . The bottles clanked together . He peered in . " What , are they cutting down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Max . " That I 'm here ! I 'm always here <p> " They should put those little cardboard strips in , " Daniel said , vanishing into the kitchen . <p> " That you 're on time , " Em said , accepting Max 's broad , one-armed hug . Max was six-four , long-armed , long-legged , his huge hands delicate , his tapering long fingers sparsely stroked with black hair . <p> " Time , " said Max , making a gesture as if flicking water from his fingertips . " Pfff . Overrated <p> He looks like an undertaker for movie stars , Daniel had observed the first time he 'd met Max , at their wedding . She laughed , because he was right , also because they were giddy in love ; but she had always thought Max looked more like a concert pianist , a Russian one . <p> " You go to the place on 104th ? " Daniel yelled from the kitchen . <p> " Or the 106th place ? " <p> " Hundred sixth , " Em said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding it without thought . That little fingertip gesture  --  Max was an encyclopedia of studied gestures . They all worked . <p> " That boy in there is a finicky bastard , for an artist , " Max observed . <p> " I like things , " Daniel yelled , overhearing . " And I like them to be right . " <p> " Your coat ? " Max held out his hands as she shrugged it off . <p> " What happened to  --  ? " <p> " Lisette , " he said . She walked with him to the closet . He found a space on the bar that had n't existed when she left , hung the old coat  --  she really hated it , she needed a new one  --  with a deft gesture . He did n't answer the question she 'd asked until he had picked up his drink from the coffee table , dipped a long finger in it , stirred the cubes , sucked the tip of his finger . " I am a man who ca n't give her what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such crap , Max . " <p> He shrugged . " Fidelity . Love . Affection . Plans . Tomorrow as opposed to today . Der kinder . " <p> " You only went out with her for two weeks <p> " Past thirty , the chicks move fast , Emsworth . " <p> They regarded each other . Then she reached forward and peeled back his suit jacket , whose blue was a slightly unusual shade , whose weave drew a hint of attention to itself . Glancing at the label , she said , " My , my <p> A rare thing : Max blushed . It made him look blotchy . He never looked blotchy . She felt pleased with herself . <p> " Well , fuck me , " he said , " it 's all appearances , right ? " <p> Daniel emerged from the kitchen with two glasses of white wine . " Max the knife <p> " Are you changing ? " she asked him . He had . Into jeans , a sweatshirt . <p> " Had n't planned on it <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Okay , " Daniel said . " Fine , fine . I ' 11 change <p> " Thanks , sweetie , " she said , touching his arm as he moved past . <p> When Daniel was gone , there was a momentary silence . Max studied Daniel 's paintings . One above the couch ; one above the black chair . One in the entry hall . Blocks of text  --  from letters Daniel 's grandfather had sent Daniel 's mother , not the pseudocryptic artsy-political sloganeering hanging in every gallery these days  --  and hints of landscape under the words , gray and umber : if Anselm Kiefer painted moors . Not uplifting ; not that she wanted art to be uplifting . Grim  --  but actually good , Em thought . She liked the one above the couch most , one haunting little statement , " Last night my dream life opened up for me . Ask me about it Marry a painter with a family history of chronic depression and paranoid schizophrenia , bright move , sweetheart . Love was always such a bright move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reactions Max was letting her see . It was hard . He probably liked them . Like them , she commanded silently . <p> Max nodded after a moment . " That one over the chair 's new , is n't it ? " <p> She nodded . Then she changed her mind and said , " Actually I think he reworked it . " <p> " I like it . " <p> " I wish someone who mattered would . " <p> Max chuckled . " Thank you ever so much ( ' <p> Em took a long drink from her wine . When had she turned into someone who needed a glass of wine ! Well , since starting work at the museum ; not everything dissolved into the tension she felt here . Home : the painting over the chair , blacks , blues , purples , hard-edged words , history of love and family , all the heavy paint . It was hard , arduous , carrying someone else 's belief in himself , as well as your own . Daniel went to the studio three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less and less sure of his work , and the other four days sat in a small room producing computer images of cancerous cells and graphs having to do with the deaths of rats for a medical journal out of Columbia Presbyterian . As he had said , sharply joking , " It 's some kind of ur-level of artistic misery  --  about six steps below prostituting your talent He was thirty-two , and she remembered so dearly from six years ago his enthusiasm , his unquestioning confidence , and a kind of optimism in his anger , joyful outrage rather than bitterness  --  bitterness was hard . For two weeks this past summer , there had been construction in the curatorial offices at the museum . They had worked through it , drywall dust in the air , so much that it felt caked in her lungs , and she would escape at the end of the day into the August heat feeling as though she could n't draw a full breath . Bitterness did that , too . <p> Strange to be tied to someone by marriage  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully , in a series of promising little explosions like cream poured into coffee  --  and see the other person getting darker . Last winter Daniel had spent days in bed . She would come home and find him lying in the dark despite doctors , despite prescriptions , despite her  --  and she was good at making people happy . She was . <p> " So , " Max said . " How 's money at the museum ? " <p> Em laughed . " What money ? It 's like trying to pull rabbits out of hats , but we do n't have any hats , and we do n't have any rabbits <p> He smiled . One day Max would be rich ; he might be already . Max 's many secrets . He was in bankruptcy law  --  " Yes , " he had once remarked , " you 're having dinner with one of the city 's foremost rising eaters of the dead . " <p> Max in his beautiful suit turned to face Daniel 's black painting again . " So , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are  --  ? " <p> " Things ? " <p> " Things . " <p> Em decided not to answer that question . " I ' 11 tell you later . <p> You ? " <p> " Me ? ' Max said . " Well , Emswell  --  " <p> The doorbell rang , then rang again , a long jangling insistent ring . <p> " Shit , " she said , " people . " <p> " They 're all people from Hoboken Lou grew up with or something , " Annie said . " Was I supposed to know they 'd all turn up at the bar ? " A long black sweater revealed her right shoulder , the fall of the cloth in line with the swoop of Annie 's curly , bronzish hair . She had her feet , in a pair of small fleeced boots , up on Em 's coffee table and was explaining the presence of the five stoned but belligerent Star Trek fans , who had arrived with her and Lou . Lou was the Star Trek editor at the publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into espionage novels . Annie was having a not-quite involvement with him . " Apparently there 's some sort of ' new ' season which is completely different from the old season  --  except that the new season is already old , too , or something  --  so I made about six kinds of terrible Star Trek faux pas , if you can believe that Annie , smoking , adjusted her sweater , considering Lou from hooded eyes as she spoke . She was higher up than Lou where they worked ; it was a sticking point . " Anyway , " Annie said , " I was sitting there , drunk off my ass , thinking , Why do I feel like an idiot ? These people are clearly the idiots . It 's so insidious when idiots act as if they are n't idiots . But they brought all that vodka . And they get very good weed . I guess that makes up for something . " <p> " Estonian vodka , " Em noted . She was sitting on the arm of the couch next to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie hugged her black-tighted legs to her chest . " He 's fucking that chick in the yellow boob-top , by the way <p> " She looks like a ferret . " <p> " Tell me about it . Maybe you could have Daniel push her out the window by accident later or something Annie sucked down a large portion of her drink . " Of course the problem is he thinks if he goes out with me then I ' 11 work some kind of successful woman emasculation voodoo on him or something She leaned forward , pitched her cigarette into a discarded beer , reached for the pack on the cushion , shook one out . " I mean , it 's pitiful , " she added . " I have no idea why I 'm attracted to him <p> Across the room people laughed : Daniel with his gnome face on , fingers clutched into claws , spinning dire stories about the life of the artist . His studio was in the West Twenties near the highway . Amazonian dyed blondes in lace teddies patrolled the block on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey plates . Transvestite hookers picked up by bridge-and-tunnel Star Trek fans ? Why not ? Annie , following her %e , nodded , blew out smoke . <p> In another direction , Max held court . Such grace . Like an emissary you 'd expect to see walking down a glass staircase from heaven , white tux , white roses in his hand . Em looked back at her husband . He seemed manic , almost desperate , and possibly drunk . <p> " How 's the shrinkage ? " Annie asked . <p> " I do n't know . He says he likes the woman he 's seeing <p> " Well , anything has to be better than the last one . I mean , an anorexic ex-actress from Queens ? Who decides who gets to be therapists anyway ? " <p> " You 're funny <p> " I 'm trying to be , dummy <p> " I know , " Em said . <p> " Hey , come on  --  you sad ? " <p> Em shook her head , though she was . Exhausted , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Annie nudged her . " Tomorrow we can talk a lot , right ? " <p> " No , that 'll be good , " Em said . <p> " Hey , " said Annie , " look at you . You 're doing that **63;317;TOOLONG thing <p> She watched his hand reach for his drink , groping blindly for it , as he continued his story . " You 're right , " she said . " Sorry . " <p> " Oh , look at that , " Annie said then . " Look , look , look . It 's so embarrassing . I mean , yes , everyone knows you have breasts , darling . " <p> She and Daniel rendezvoused outside the back door , on the dark landing of the back stairwell . Her husband 's hair was sticking out ; he was n't wearing his glasses anymore . " Those friends of Lou 's were getting stoned in the bedroom . I figured you 'd rather they did n't . I beat ' em with sticks until they got out . Good dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which meant they 'd get complaints from their next door neighbor , the man-whose-nose-ran , in the morning . Daniel finished the drink in his hand , looked at the glass appraisingly , licked his lips several times . " This vodka 's very strange  --  tastes like it 's got wood chips in it or something <p> She touched his arm . " Hey  --  maybe you should take it easy ? " She knew this pattern : he was n't a drinker except when he was depressed . So she 'd been right not to trust his good mood , his easy affection , his arms around her  --  now she would give , and he would take . She did n't want to come home to two weeks of silence . <p> " People who take it easy do n't get very far Daniel said flatly . <p> " That was n't what I meant . " <p> He smiled at her . " I know . " <p> Rather than take up the challenge , Em stepped over and opened the stairwell window , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times She wanted air . It was too close . <p> Daniel came up behind her . " Hey , Em ? Sweetie ? " <p> " What ? " <p> When she turned , he stepped back and shrugged , his little boy 's what-did-I-do-wrong expression on his face . It was exasperating . She felt like giving him lessons : number one , acting innocently wronged when you are deliberately pissing me off is a stupid tactic . " Daniel ? " <p> " Mm . " <p> " Do you think tomorrow could we set aside some time , to talk  --  a specific time ? Have a plan ? In the morning ? " The counselor they 'd been to a few months before had suggested this as a good idea , proactive , set aside time , blah blah blah . Em had felt vindicated : Of course it was a good idea . <p> " Talking , " Daniel said , as if it were something he 'd heard about , a new fad . " Thought I 'd go to the studio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yeah . Most of it . I wanted to get started early <p> " Okay , fine , forget it . " <p> " No  --  look  --  what about later ? " <p> " I 'm meeting Annie downtown . Then there 's that reception . The donor thing . That 's at five . Forget it . It 's pointless . Never mind The real problem was that after being at the studio , he would be in a terrible mood , and they would fight . Em was certain that the anger she felt at that moment could only be half towards Daniel-the other half simply rose out of frustration at the resistance and clutter of their lives . But here he was , the sullen , half-drunk target . She was n't going to give up Annie , and the reception was work and could n't be dropped , and she was n't going to back down , even to make him stop her , to prove that what was between them mattered to him . No : she would wait him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until the next Ice Age . In this one instance , he could be the one to compromise . <p> He was staring intently at his shoulder . <p> She waited . Hello , Ice Age . Okay . Screw it . She gave up . " Dan ? Are we still having a conversation ? " <p> He nodded , then reached up and , between thumb and forefinger , delicately trapped a long hair , lifting it from the weave of his sweater . The pale filament trembled in the air between them , caught in a plane of light from the partly open kitchen door . <p> " Yours , " he said . <p> She sighed . " Is that significant ? " <p> Now he looked at her , an intensity she recognized and loved in his face , overlaid with a sliding lack of focus . Self-pity and vodka and resentment . It was horrible . " Hey , " he said . " What do you mean ? Of course it 's significant . It 's yours . I love you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego to the fucking shooting gallery : Daniel was saying , some anecdote about taking slides to galleries . " Bing bing bing bing bing , down you go . " <p> Annie laughed , dearly drunk . <p> When Max came up , Daniel rounded on him , too mockingly friendly to be taken as anything but antagonistic . " Max ! Secret Max ! What secrets lurk in the dark heart of Max , fucking shadow knows .. " <p> Max rubbed the corner of his mouth , decided to smile . " No secrets , Daniel . You know me . Perfectly transparent . " <p> For a moment , Em hated his composure . It felt unfair somehow . <p> " You 're not in Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania . In fucking Gary , Indiana , or something . " <p> " Not tonight . We 're busy cleaning up a department store . " <p> " ' Cleaning up : " her husband said . " I love you , Max . What the fuck does that mean ? " <p> " It 's like ' collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke . " Soft targets . " <p> " Thank you very much . I 'm a lawyer , not an animal Max was unruffled . He loved attention in any circumstance . <p> " What do you lawyer ? " one of the stoned friends of Lou demanded . <p> " Bankruptcies . Fiscal carrion . I 'm the grave digger . I hold the widows ' hands and comfort them after the man in the suit takes the long dive . AU that , " Max said . " I 'm good at it <p> " Max the knife , " Daniel said . He was leaning against a table . Then his face changed , and he turned and walked off , towards the bedroom . <p> When Em went back , she found Daniel on the bed , on his stomach but draped off the edge , with one hand on the floor to support himself . He was sweating , and his hair was matted against his forehead . The lights were o &; Em shut the door behind her . " Sweetie ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you sick ? " <p> " Yeah . I 'm sorry . " <p> She came and knelt and stroked the back of his head . With his hand on the hardwood floor , he seemed to be bracing himself against the downward pull of his own weight . " Do you want to get all the way on the bed ? " <p> " Nope . Too drunk . " <p> " Okay , " she said , standing up . <p> He swallowed , licked his lips . " You need help ? Cleaning up ? " <p> " Shhh . People are still here . Annie 's here . She 'll help . Max , too , " Part of her felt such despair , she could n't even understand where to place it . <p> " I did n't get any work done today . I ca n't work . " <p> " Yes , you can , " she told him . An exchange that had become ritual . She wondered if she should get a towel . There was still the world , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . <p> " I 'm a fuck , " he said . " I ca n't . I ca n't work . Fuck , I feel sick . " <p> After a moment he added , " I feel like you used to be happy , and then I came along and fucked it up . I 'm so frightened . " <p> He rolled away from her , curling up on the bed . She got on the bed and lay next to him and held him as he cried . <p> Her exhaustion made the party feel as if it had moved underwater . A number of people had left as well , and the wreckage  --  the cups scattered here and there , the chips ground into the floor , the empty bottles in the kitchen  --  seemed all the sharper . Annie came up to her . " I 'm floozled . It 's a new word . I made it up . Like it ? " <p> " Just do n't you be sick , too , " Em said  --  what was she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Annie twisted a ringlet with her forefinger . <p> " Poor guy . " <p> She was carrying a nested stack of sticky cups into the kitchen when Max materialized . <p> " You need more wine . We 'll take a walk . I ' 11 buy it <p> A walk sounded like a gift . Even five minutes . At the closet , she suggested to Annie that she might  --  God knew how , since Annie could barely stand  --  keep an eye on things . Annie seemed pleased with her new authority . " Max is going to buy me a yacht , and I 'm going to sail to Bora Bora , " Em told her . " I 'll be back in six months or so <p> Then they were in the hall . <p> " Take the stairs ? " Max suggested . " I need to get my blood flowing . " <p> " Max , eight floors !

" Eduardo said at the door . He held it open after them  --  the flowery iron grillwork swinging easily and silently on oiled hinges  --  then stood rubbing his hands , a concerned expression on his face . <p> " Take Riverside Max said , steering her by the elbow . <p> Inexplicably the wind was n't as sharp against the high silent buildings as on West End . On the lower street , traffic rushed hissing ; a pale fog , luminous from within , was fingering in off the Hudson ; above them snow spiraled down , whirling in cones of light . <p> " So fucking peaceful , " Max said . <p> Em said , " I think it 's spooky . Look , can we not talk about anything about my life and just talk about yours , okay ? " <p> " Of Course . I love talking about my life . The interpretations are so various . " <p> She was relieved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , striding silently along . His black shoes impressed the snow without sound . <p> " Well , I 've decided that I 'm in love with you , " Max said finally . <p> " Oh , Max , not again . Jesus . I mean , this is without question absolutely the worst possible time , you know ! " <p> " Ah , but this time I 've thought about it , " he said lightly . <p> " Max , " she said . <p> " ' Max , " " he repeated , walking a little ahead of her , gallant , as if the buildings might fail abruptly and open to Russian fields . <p> Riverside on nights like this always made her think of Tack the Ripper  --  she wished Max would walk next to her , but just walk . Not talk , not push . Not ask for anything . And not be charming . In her sadness , she did n't have the energy to play a good game . <p> " Max , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going back to my apartment . " " Pfff . " <p> " Please stop pfff-ing ? Okay ? " <p> Max came to an abrupt halt . He turned to face her . As far as <p> can tell  --  and I did think about this  --  anything I feel for you has nothing to do with Daniel . Right ? " <p> " Wrong , " she said , and walked past him , brushing against his coat as she did , against his presence . In her life again . They 'd slept together , once  --  after she was married , but a long time ago , the first time Daniel had been seriously depressed . The sex , Em had always felt , had not been a betrayal but an escape , into the clarity of Max 's flat confidence and playfully grave desire . Like taking a shower so you could have privacy to think . She had never told Daniel . It would have upset him beyond what the infidelity had meant : He would n't have understood that sleeping with Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Max had understood ; and vanished . A hint of self-protection ? She 'd always thought so . Five years  --  any physical memory of that afternoon was far outweighed by how long she and Max had been friends . By the complexity and weight of her life with Daniel . <p> They walked together silently up to 106th Street , and by some mutual consent , crossed it and kept walking up Riverside . I should not be doing this , Em thought . But she did feel her exhaustion lift in the freezing air . At least she could play , flirt . Lighten up . <p> " I mean , Max , " she said , " how many women have you slept with ? Just this year , all right ? " <p> " Emswiggle , " Max said , " believe me . There 's only you . " <p> She laughed , and then glanced at him . " You are joking , are n't you ? " <p> " Of course , " Max said , utterly unknowable . <p> Several city buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , hurtled by under the trees , down below on Riverside . <p> " Em , " he said , his breath smoking out , his black coat swirling around his legs as they walked , " think about some things . You 've tried . You 're such a giver . Right ? But look at Daniel . He 's falling . Some other angel 's going to have to catch him this time <p> " Stop it , " she said . " Do you want me to hate you ! " <p> " I 'm such a creation , " Max replied after a moment . " It 's funny . I finally managed to perfect myself The night a was empty and quiet . " You 're wonderful , " he said . " We 'd have fun . It 's not a proposition , it 's an invitation , understand ? " <p> " And you 'd vanish , and my marriage would be over <p> Max turned and grabbed her hands . He said , " That 's right . " <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
