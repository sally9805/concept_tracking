He was a sailor , explorer , inventor , best-selling author , prizewinning filmmaker , passionate environmentalist and canny businessman . Instantly recognizable by his pipe , red cap and gaunt silhouette , Jacques-Yves Cousteau  --  a.k.a . " Captain Planet "  --  was arguably the century 's best known , most popular Frenchman . For generations of scuba divers  --  and millions of armchair explorers  --  he created a crystal-clear window for the unseen world beneath the waves . <P> Before Cousteau , undersea exploration was limited by the length of a human breath or the tether on a diving helmet .
