He was a clumsy bard , inept at the complex fingerings that made eduldamer strings hum so sweetly in a master musician 's hands . His musical deficiency owed much to the fact that his right hand was made entirely out of polished black stone , carved in perfect replication of a human hand , so detailed that one could see the slight reliefwork of veins and moles , the knolls of knuckles , even peeling cuticles captured in the hard glossy rock . Most of the fine hairs had snapped from the delicately rendered diamond-shaped pores , but you could feel where they had been , like adamantine stubble . His left hand was more dexterous than most , and his calloused fingers hammered the strings as best they could to make up for the other hand 's disability ; but his rock-solid right hand was good for nothing more than brutal strumming and whacking . He could n't pinch a plectrum . The soundbox was scarred and showed the signs of much abuse , the thin wood having been patched many times over . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most who asked . " Comes and goes . I 'm looking for the treacherous slab who did it to me and disappeared before he could undo it . " <p> If you asked why he did n't learn to play a different instrument in the meantime , one more suited to his handicap , the bard 's face went hard and dark and stony as his hand . " Once I was proficient enough , " he 'd say . " The eduldamer spoiled me for anything else . It still suits my voice . And besides , what else could I play one-handed ? What bard accompanies himself on sticks or spoons ? I ca n't exactly sing while I blow ullala pipes . . . . " <p> He was right about his voice . Though his stone thumb grated on the strings , his voice was strong . The conflict of these sounds  --  one harsh and scarcely in control , the other pure and deliberate  --  made the bard 's performances more than merely bearable . Wherever he went , he was a curiosity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who could play an instrument while he sang accompaniment , the bard scoffed sadly . " I travel alone , " he said . " I would n't wish my ill fortune on anyone else . " <p> One gathered that this had not always been the case . <p> The name of this sulking , sarcastic , stone-fingered , honey-tongued loner was Gorlen Vizenfirth . <p> Gorlen stumbled into Dankden in a torrential rain , a phenomenon apparently so common in this climate that the mud-flooded streets of the mud-colored town were lined with patterned stepping stones of the sort usually found at stream crossings . Hand-pull rope-and-raft ferries operated at intersections , deep in the street canyons between the sagging , slouching shops and houses . Having spied an inn with a lamplit marquee across the street , during his customary search of the rooflines for anything resembling a gargoyle , Gorlen stepped onto the slimy planks of one such raft and began to pull himself against the muddy current . He had taken no more than three strong pulls  --  a lurching mode of progress made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clench with  --  when he heard a cry from the sidewalk ( or bank ) he had just deserted . Turning , he saw a woman and a boy , both wrapped in shiny dark cloaks , only their white faces visible . The woman beckoned for him to return . <p> Something more than courtesy compelled him to obey : his one flesh palm was already blistering . At this rate , he would be unable to play the eduldamer by the time he reached the far row of stepping stones , and thus unable to earn a living . He stepped aside to let the pair aboard ; the woman gave him a smile and her thanks . The rain and chill had brought a flush to her cheeks ; her eyes were dark and gleaming reflecting some source of light invisible to him in the gloomy afternoon . She looked too young to be the boy 's mother , for which , seeing her beauty , he was suddenly glad . <p> As they crowded past him into a comer of the raft , Gorlen realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sodden as his underwear , the strength drenched out of him , but making a show of it , he grasped the rope once more and yanked them out into the mudflow , turning his face into his dripping sleeve to hide the grimaces he made with every painful draw . <p> The short voyage must have gone more slowly than the Dankden woman was used to . Gorlen 's palms were barely burning before he felt her beside him and saw her gloved hands reaching up to grasp the rope . The palms of her gloves were heavily reinforced , and with good reason . She pulled with such strong and practiced strokes that the rope was nearly tom from his hand . The raft scudded over the street in a dozen pulls , to which Gorlen made only a token contribution . <p> At the far bank , somewhat chastened , he tipped his hat , spilling a small flood of rainwater down his front , and thanked the woman . He caught her staring at his right hand , embarrassed , she looked away . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . <p> The woman turned on him with a cry  --  " Jezzle ! Please do n't mind my brother , sir . " <p> " That 's all right , " said Gorlen , offering his flesh hand to her as she stepped onto the stone landing . " Children always say what 's in their minds . When do we lose that innocence , I wonder ? " <p> " It 's none of his business , " she said , " that 's all . " <p> " I 'll tell you , though , " he said . " I got in trouble with the priests of Nardath a few years back . They laid a task on me  --  and one of their pet gargoyles turned my pinky to stone as a reminder . Every time I dawdled on my errand , or deliberately headed in the wrong direction , the blackness spread . Finger by finger , it swallowed my hand . As you can see , I was reluctant to do exactly as the priests asked , even at the cost of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and jerked back smarting knuckles . " I guess you did what they wanted , or you 'd be rock all over . " <p> " Lucky for you I did , too . In spite of myself , I saved the world . Some would even say , the universe . " <p> Jezzle gazed at him coolly . " Wish I had one like that . " <p> Gorlen smiled up at the woman , and was startled to see her expression . " You do n't have to lie to him , " she said as his grin died . " He 's a child , not an idiot . " <p> She seized the boy 's hand and pulled him away before Gorlen could say another word , in his defense or otherwise . <p> That 'll teach me , he thought as he watched them pick their way over the stones . Hauling out my heroic credentials to impress a lady . Of course she considers me a fool . Who would n't ? <p> I 'm going to start saying it 's artificial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murk , he finally followed in the same direction until he reached the inn he 'd spotted from across the street . <p> The place was called the Drydock . Tilted signs , hand-lettered in bright orange paint and nailed to the facade , proclaimed the merits of the inn : <p> " Come in &; dry off ! " " A snug harbor ! " " Completely dry inside ! " " Boot-warmers available ! " " Heat in every room ! " " Dry beds &; sheets ! " " Your comfort cheerfully guaranteed ! " A huge stone hearth was pictured on the wall ; he could almost feel the heat of the painted flames . <p> Gorlen grinned and pushed open the door , expecting gusts of warm air . He was met instead by a clammy draft reeking of mildew . He could n't be sure whether it was his soaked boots or the spongy mass of carpet that squelched underfoot as he stepped into a grotto dim and dank as a frog 's den . Scattered lamps glowed with a weak , watery light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a steady streaming drizzle ; louder than the muffled sizzle of the rain , it was the sound of countless leaks , of water pouring into tin pails and teetering saucers . Makeshift gutters lined the walls , carrying run-off to a row of windows at the rear of the high-roofed room . Tiny cataracts cascaded from the ceiling , vanishing through holes they had worn in the floor . Spray from the myriad fountains peppered his face and hands . Mossy stairs rose on either side to an opposing pair of lofts ; above were rows of open doors , all so badly warped that probably they would never close again . <p> Across the room , behind a countertop , cloaked in the bright yellow skin of some no doubt toxic local amphibian , stood a man whom it would have been charitable ( and an insult to toads ) to dub " toadlike . " Gray-cheeked , with bulging eyes in a lumpy face , he patiently mopped his countertop with alternate strokes of a rubber knife and a sponge . Water flew to the floor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The counter was instantly soaked again , and the bucket would soon need emptying . He interrupted this futile procedure for a moment when Gorlen entered , then went back to it . <p> Gorlen should have left immediately ; there was no real point in staying or stoking the bartender 's immediate , obvious hostility . But the blatant fraud , the howling misrepresentations of the lurid signs outside , spurred both his indignation and his sense of the absurd . He found the combination irresistible . <p> Striding across the soft planks , he called on the yellow-clad proprietor : " You , there ! Sir  --  if I may call you that ? What is the meaning of your bold and boldly false inducements ? I have never seen such a bare-faced bait and switch , which fools an eager customer for perhaps one hundredth of a second , and gains you nothing but their ill will in record time . " <p> The innkeeper , if such he was , looked sidelong at a collection of mushroom growths clustered at the far end of the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were customers , several blobby souls wrapped in wrinkled gray mold-colored cloaks , hunched on spindly iron stools and sipping liquor from tall glasses which they guarded with cupped hands from the more unpredictable leaks . Gorlen sensed that they had heard such objections before ; although they made no sound , from the quivering of their oddly similar bulks he felt certain they were laughing . <p> " We 're under new management , " the toad-man croaked , and at that the laughter rang outright . " I ca n't be held responsible for the claims of the previous owner . " <p> " Very good , " Gorlen said , joining with them in laughter . " I see the merit of your argument . But what would you say if I were to bring your claims more in line with reality ? " <p> " What d'ye mean by that ? " <p> " I mean I would happily volunteer to remove the signs from your establishment , which surely serve only to bring unhappy and deluded customers through your door . The name itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you paid plenty of auris for its ironic properties alone , which I can not help but admire . " <p> " Take down my signs ? " the keeper said , Flowering at his customers to shut them up . <p> " I thought you said they were the previous owner 's signs , and not yours at all . " <p> " I paid for ' em , that makes ' em mine . " <p> " Then I 'll bring them straight in , out of harm 's way , and even suggest a few places where you might put them . " Gorlen turned and walked out the way he had come in . The saturated air , which had seemed oppressive before , now tasted fresh and invigorating ; at least it was not thick with mold spores striving to establish green colonies in his nasal passages . On the porch outside the Drydock , he wrenched at the nearest of the ludicrous signs , finding that the swollen wood splintered and crumbled in his hands . He set what remained of it carefully beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flash of slick yellow , the innkeeper sprang upon him . <p> Gorlen had only an instant to brace himself ; it was not enough . Broad fat hands grabbed and shoved him , first onto his butt and then across the scummy planks . He 'd been carrying his eduldamer case slung over one shoulder , and he felt its strap catch on a porch post , along with his travelsack . He wished heartily that he could have stayed there with them , but the upright toad had given him a good push , and did not neglect to follow through . Gorlen hit the edge of the porch and awkwardly tumbled between the stepping stones , sprawling into the muddy stream . Thrashing for purchase , he began to sink . <p> He kicked out , his eyes full of mud , mud in his mouth , and no bottom beneath him . This was no street  --  it was a river ! <p> Once he had been as fine a swimmer as he 'd been a musician . The gargoyle had robbed him of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a rich mixture of mud , which did nothing to buoy him up like friendly water . It was a miracle that he managed to stay afloat for more than a few seconds in the current ; a miracle , also , that guided him toward another of the raft landings , where even now someone was moving out across the flooded street and shouting at him  --  words he could n't hear through the mud in his ears  --  as they tried to pull the raft into his path . <p> He hit it hard and blind , throwing his arms over the deck , clambering aboard with assistance from his rescuer . He sprawled as if dead , then struggled to his knees , choking into the face of a woman . <p> " Well , well , if it is n't the savior of the universe , " said his rescuer blithely , hauling the raft back toward the stone landing where her brother Jezzle waited . <p> " At your service , " Gorlen replied , and promptly vomited copious quantities of dilute brown gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Jezzle lived with their father , an amphibian hunter and dealer in phib hides , in a set of small but thoroughly dry rooms at the top of a high-peaked house where the rain rang loud on every slanted ceiling , but leaked through nowhere . Phib skins hung drying in almost every room , which made an already cramped apartment feel impossibly crowded . From where Gorlen sat by the fire , nursing a mug of warm fermented plapioc , he could not make out all of Taian or Jezzle , though both sat near him in the parlor . They appeared only as fragments between the dangling curled hides . Accustomed now to the warm , somewhat swampy odor of the place , he was content to fill himself with the thick sweet white liquid and listen to the other two talk while his clothes  --  freshly soaped and rinsed in rain  --  dried on a rack by the fire . <p> Metal clattered in the hall ; the door slammed and boots came stomping . Jezzle jumped up to greet his father , a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway and went quite silent and suspicious when he saw Gorlen , dressed only in blankets , reclining in what must have been his own favorite chair . <p> Gorlen jumped hastily to his feet , but Taian was already explaining . The hunter burst out laughing , and came forward to clap him on the shoulder . " So , young man ! Five minutes in Dankden and you 've already made an implacable enemy ! Old Stoag and his cronies will be tracking you down , you 've my word on it , now that you 've impugner the comforts of his inn . " <p> Gorlen was n't completely sure the man was joking , although his smile was wide enough . He must have seen Gorlen 's uncertainty , though . <p> " Ah , relax . That place will collapse under its own soggy weight soon enough , and carry Stoag back into the mire where he belongs . They keep those signs up for a laugh , to watch the faces on any stranger who comes in . You threatened to get between a phib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tide-flood . " <p> " A phib ? " Gorlen said . " So he 's not completely human , then ? " <p> " Not by half , no ; nor his customers . They crawl up from the swamps at high tide and try to lay claim to Dankden once more , with their usual pewling complaints that the town is rightfully theirs . A hopeless bunch , and utterly useless  --  except for the good skins of their purebreed brethren . Ha ! " <p> And here he thrust at Gorlen a fresh phib skin , still limp and wet with ichor , smelling far fishier than the dried hides hanging throughout the apartment . It was grayish green in color ; there were others in similarly muted tones slung over the hunter 's shoulder . He slipped them all off and handed them to Taian , who carried the hides down the hall . <p> " Take good care of them , girl , " he called after her . " That 's the best lot I 've hauled in an age . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gorlen leapt out of the way . " By all means , sit ! " <p> " Ah , well , if you do n't mind . . . " He sank down on the chair , groaning with relief , and pulled off his sopping boots . These and the rest of his clothes were quickly mounted before the fire ; then he wrapped himself in a thick robe that had been warming on a hook beside the hearth . Jezzle appeared with a large goblet of plapioc . The big man sucked it down in a few swallows , then handed it back to the boy , wiping curds from his mustache . " Another like that one , " he said with a laugh . Then he put out his hand to Gorlen . " I 'm Clabbus . " <p> " Pleased , sir . Gorlen Vizenfirth is the name . " <p> Gorlen put out his right hand . Clabbus showed a moment 's surprise , then a lingering curiosity . " Eh ? " he said , touching it and then letting go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not at all , " said Gorlen . <p> Clabbus hunched toward the fire , and Gorlen turned the hand palm up , palm down , letting the old man inspect the perfectly rendered patterns . " Fate lines , " he said after awhile . " I do n't read them , but these look strangely symmetrical . You carved them yourself , I suppose ? " <p> " In fact , " said Gorlen , " those are the very lines I was born with . And you 're not the first to notice their symmetry . Some say they herald great luck , others an evil destiny . So far both prophecies have proved equally true . Half the time good luck delivers me from some dreadful end into a pleasant one , much as your daughter rescued me today ; the rest of the time , I seem pitched from relative comfort into darker adventures . Safe decisions lead me into awful trouble , and only the riskiest endeavors ever seem to deliver me to anything like a moment 's peace . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us are too busy making a living . I notice your instrument case . . . . ? " <p> " That is my living . " " Is it a good one ? " <p> " Well , I have no house  --  " <p> " This shabby flat is rented , my boy ! What do I own ? " <p> "  --  and no family . " <p> " Ah . Well . " Clabbus blinked sadly , in sympathy . <p> " And what friends I 've made are scattered far and wide ; some of them no doubt rue the day that brought me into their lives , and celebrate the day that carried me off again . " <p> " Surely that wo n't be the case with us . Jezzle , another plap ' for Gorlen Vizenfirth as well ! " <p> The boy had anticipated his father 's request . For a time they sat sipping together by the fire . Jezzle brought a tray of spiced meat and pickles for his father , then sat by the chair and asked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swampy reaches outside Dankden , Gorlen found his mind wandering to Taian , whom he could hear humming down the hall . He pulled on his warm , dry clothes and followed the sound of her voice until he reached a closed door ; he rapped lightly and passed through . <p> He found himself standing on a covered balcony , above the rushing street . He habitually checked the rooftops across the way , some taller than this one , all of them lacking any but the commonest masonry and decorative plasters . There was nothing like a gargoyle anywhere in sight . <p> A huge stove burned in one comer of the balcony , smoke fuming from a perforated pipe that curled from the chimney . Taian was trimming the hides and hanging them in the gouts of smoke , which then escaped around the edges of the eaves . A heap of slimy globular vegetables filled a half-keg in the comer , and every now and then Taian reached over , plucked one up , and tossed it into the stove , where it exploded wetly , releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke for nearly a minute . <p> " Essential to curing the hides , " she explained . " Otherwise they crack and crumble and smell terrible . They wo n't repel water for long , either . " <p> " Fine rainwear your family makes , " Gorlen said . " I wish I had such a cloak myself . My common clothes are soaked right through in a strong shower . " <p> " Well , " she said coyly , " perhaps something could be arranged . " <p> " I do n't wish to take advantage , " he said , moving closer to her on the balcony . <p> " No more than you already have , you mean ? " she said , whirling away from him to gather another batch of skins . <p> " Is this your livelihood ? " he asked , letting his hands fall . <p> " For the moment . Curing hides , stitching cloaks , and looking after my brother . I wanted to be a hunter like my father , but until Jezzle 's old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Father used to take me with him into the marshes , to watch the boat and help keep the lines clear while he dived ; but since our mother died , I 've had to stay home . With my luck , it will be Jezzle who ends up the hunter ; I 'll have spent my youth and strength on domestic chores . " <p> " I doubt that , " Gorlen said . " You 're young and strong enough to be a hunter when the time comes . " <p> " You think so ? " <p> " Well , " he said , smiling , " when I remember how swiftly you got the raft to me this afternoon , and hauled me aboard  --  I think you could do anything you like . And Jezzle looks like a fast-growing lad . He 'll be ready for the swamps before you know it . " <p> " I hope you 're right . But really you know nothing of our way of life . You 're only guessing . " She leaned against the balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes . <p> " At the particulars , yes , " he said . " But I 've traveled so widely that I think mine is an educated guess . " He put his left hand on the rail beside her , leaning closer . She was warm from the stove ; he was close enough to feel that much . <p> " Are you an educated man , then ? " <p> " Only in the ways of the world , " he said . <p> Her eyes closed . Now he could kiss her . <p> At that moment , shouts rose from the street  --  a chorus of gravelly voices that sounded as rough as the rain . Gorlen was inclined to think it a random rabble , nothing to interrupt his pursuit of Taian 's lips . But her eyes leapt open and she spun away with an angry cry : " No ! Not again ! " <p> She pushed through the door , calling for her father , leaving Gorlen nearly tipping over the railings into the rain . Saving himself from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multicolored mob that had gathered on the landings and stepping stones across the street from Clabbus 's high house . He could n't quite hear what they were calling nor could he imagine why they were directing their energies at this particular balcony . Like Stoag and his ungainly customers , these were lumpy and misshapen folk , albeit many were brightly colored in orange and yellow and vivid green . Gorlen realized with some surprise that these brilliant vestments were their own skins . <p> Clabbus appeared at his side . " Where are they  --  oh ! Leave off pestering my family ! " he hollered down at the crowd . <p> " What about our families ? " one called back  --  though it was hard to tell which . <p> " Mine 's an honest living on land that 's rightly ours ! " <p> " Rightly yours ? You come into our very dens  --  trapping and killing ! " <p> " Bah , nonsense ! Go or I 'll have the guards here in a moment ! " He turned to the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorlen understood . Jezzle tried to peer out past her , but Clabbus pushed them both back inside . <p> " What do they want now ? " Taian asked . <p> " Never you mind . Let 's go in , Gorlen . This will take care of itself . " From the back of the crowd , hidden till that moment by an overhanging eave , came a wailing woman , carrying in her arms a large bundle . In the dripping rain and evening murk , Gorlen could hardly see what it was , although she lifted it up for their inspection . " Look what you 've done ! " she cried . " In what way is this rightful ? " <p> She slipped on the stones and went down weakly , dropping her bundle . As it flopped to the hard surface , it sprawled out in full form . Gorlen saw a raw , oozing figure , about the size of a child , but mottled and marbled with streaks of gray and blue and yellow . Gorlen heard Taian gasp ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know not what you mean , " Clabbus called , " nor do I care to see another rotting phib carcass after the day I 've had . " <p> The woman was unable to answer ; her neighbors helped her to her feet , and rescued her bundle . One of them turned his face up to the balcony . <p> " Another carcass ? This was her only child . " <p> " Father ! " Taian said . <p> Clabbus turned quickly and grabbed his daughter 's arm , pushing her toward the door . Jezzle jumped back as they rushed through it . " Liars , " he said . " That 's a common phib . If it 's mine at all , I caught it in the swamps . They 're trying to start a riot , that 's all . " <p> " You rob our very clutches ! " came a cry behind them , cut off as Clabbus slammed the door . <p> " I 've had enough of them , " Clabbus swore as he stormed down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week they 're noisier , more insistent . As if things have n't been hard on everyone . " <p> " Far harder on the phibs , " Taian said , pushing aside hides as they returned to the parlor . <p> Clabbus dropped down in his chair and swept his thumb across his dinner plate to wipe up the last bits of grease . " True enough . The hunting 's nothing like it used to be out there in the swamps , not like when I was a boy . All Dankden is hurting . Those halfbreeds blame their hardship on us hunters , when we 're the only ones who ever brought a damn thing to this sodden place . " <p> " There was nothing here before we came , " said Jezzle sternly , echoing his father 's tone . " Nothing but swamps and marsh and knuckleroot trees , and dumb phibs everywhere . " <p> " Do n't speak badly of the phibs , boy . They 're your only honest living . " <p> " But pa , what they call us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's the human in them saying that . A phib is but an animal , neither good nor evil apart from the quality of its skin . And everything you have you owe to their hides . " <p> This settled , Clabbus sat himself down and crossed his hands , scowling into the fire . Taian and Jezzle retreated , and Gorlen thought it best to follow . " Well , that 's another evening spoiled , " Taian said as they went into the kitchen . <p> " I 'm going to look and see if they 're still in the street , " Jezzle said mischievously . <p> " Do n't make things worse , " Taian warned him . " Father would n't like it . " <p> " He 'll never know . Someone needs to keep an eye on them , make sure they do n't try setting fire to the house or something wicked like that . " <p> " Watch them from the balcony if you must , " she said . " But do n't go near them  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gorlen watched Taian cleaning up the dinner plates , rinsing them under a stream of water that ran through pipes from the roof . <p> " What brought you to Dankden ? " she asked . <p> " I 'm looking for a gargoyle , " he said , nervously stroking his stone hand . " Where does your father hunt ? " <p> " Far out in the marshes . The phibs make their homes in underwater caves beneath the knuckleroots . It 's dirty , dangerous work  --  diving in the mud flows , feeling your way to an entrance , then climbing up inside to face them down in their own dens . " <p> " And are they savage fighters ? " <p> She shrugged . " As to that , you will have to ask my father to show you his bum-scars . The slightest touch of their skin is enough to sear holes in human flesh . My father has writhed for weeks , in agony from an amphibian 's caustic hug . " <p> " And yet you wear these skins with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong , mature phibs manifest the poison coat . Those bright colors you sometimes see in halfbreeds are about all they retain from their full phib ancestors . We stay away from mature hides  --  they 're worthless for the trade . Only immature or senile hides are really suitable . It takes several years for a phib to come into full poison , and toward the end of their life , well  --  I guess nature no longer cares whether they survive . " <p> " So in other words , the ones you hunt are defenseless . " <p> " You would n't say that were you to come up in one of their dens in full darkness , not knowing where you stood or how many surrounded you , or the color of those that waited . . . . " <p> Gorlen shuddered . " It must take a brave hunter . " <p> " Yes , especially now that the phibs are so few . Once the swamps were hopping with them . Now the ones that remain are more clever than ever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groves . My father has been weeks on the trail of the hides he brought home today . " <p> " Must be quite an art to it . " <p> " And a science , yes . Now excuse me  --  I ca n't leave the new hides hanging outside any longer . " <p> " I 'll come with you , " Gorlen said . " In case the mob is there . " <p> The rain had let up when they emerged . The cloud cover was full of ragged holes through which starshine and the glow of the deep blue sky bled down on the black-running streets . There was no sound except the isolated drip-drop of things drying out , and the steady wash of the current . That , and Clabbus snoring in the parlor . Gorlen looked over the railing and was astonished to find that the gathering across the way had grown in size , though not in volume . In the clearing night , the vigil was eerily still . The halfbreed phibs crouched down to watch the house  --  this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle sprang to life and was used to light a second wick ; each of this pair touched two more , and the starry flames spread until there were dozens down there , and that many again flickering on the turbulent face of the watercourse . <p> Gorlen saw a shadow pass across the reflected flames , towing ripples behind it . It was a very small boat , unlit , with one small figure paddling . It glided near the edge of the gathering , and suddenly he heard a voice he knew  --  " Phibby vermin ! Stay in your dens ! " At the same time , the rower flung something wet into the crowd . With the splatter , numerous flames were extinguished , and many voices began to swear and shout . <p> " I hope I 'm wrong , " Gorlen said to Taian , who was gathering the smoky cloaks , " but is n't that Jezzle down there ? " <p> Taian gasped and flung herself to the rail . " No ! " <p> The waterway was suddenly boiling around the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . New cries joined the curses - the shrieks of a boy in trouble . The boat rocked and tipped , rolling completely over and up again . Jezzle coughed out a bubbling yell , but his boat rolled again , silencing him . This time when it righted itself , the compartment was empty . Gorlen saw the paddle sucked away , spinning slowly down the street . <p> " Jezzle ! " Taian screamed . <p> She ran back into the hall and crashed into Clabbus who was coming up from shallow sleep . He grabbed her by the shoulders  --  " What is it ? Where is he ? " <p> " In the street , " she answered . " They 're drowning him ! " <p> Father and daughter , utterly familiar with the stairs leading from their flat , left Gorlen behind ; he picked his way cautiously down through mold-smelling dark , clinging to the smooth stairrails with his flesh hand . By the time he reached the street , the commotion had spread to both sides of the avenue . The candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried them stood uncertainly at the water 's edge , outnumbered by many clearly human shapes , rushing back and forth . Lamps were lit and hoisted on poles above the water , and swept back and forth to light the surging street . One lamp lit a phib-skin coracle sculling about in the middle of the avenue . In it , Clabbus stood shouting while Taian paddled and poled , moving swiftly here and there . Finally their boat touched the far bank , and Clabbus leapt out . Of what ensued , Goren could make out only the very tips of raggedly shouted sentences . Several other boats were quickly dispatched downstream ; people ran from stone to stone , calling and casting their lights over the water . It had all happened so quickly . . . . <p> Gorlen could find no place for himself in all this . He noticed that those of amphibian ancestry soon vanished completely , which seemed wise now that the decks around Clabbus 's building were crowded with a collection of strong , scabby characters dressed almost exclusively in heavy-duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , which they wore like the emblem of their guild , he guessed these were hide hunters , Clabbus 's peers . They seemed to speak a secret language , and more than one eyed him suspiciously where he leaned against a post in a shaded comer . It was not until Taian and Clabbus returned in the coracle , towing the boy 's empty craft behind them , that they raised their voices . <p> The hunter looked shaken and weary  --  aged by years in the space of an hour . As he stepped onto the bank , supported by a white-faced , grim-mouthed Taian , the other hunters surrounded him . Gorlen heard them offer both sympathy and the promise of vengeance . Neither evoked any response from Clabbus . Taian led him to a bench against the wall , seated him , and tumed to look back blankly at the water . <p> " What can I do , Taian ? " Gorlen asked . <p> It took a long time for her eyes to focus on him . " Nothing . There 's nothing anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushed up behind Gorlen from the dark edge of the river  --  someone dripping wet , yet burning . Gorlen pulled his arm away with a hiss , the skin searing , and turned to see a face of incredible virulence passing him , pushing into lamplight . It was more phib than man , by far : orange mottling on a blue face , vivid streaks and yellow stripes with points of inky , glistening blackness . Every hunter stared at the phib , and he saw on their faces everything from terror and rage to frustrated lust . No doubt they wished they could have harvested and worn the bright mature colors . The creature stopped before Clabbus and stood looking down at him from a proud height . When it spoke , its words were clear human speech , though somewhat frothy with mucus or mud . <p> " If you want your boy , " it said , " you must come to the place where you murdered my own . " <p> Clabbus leapt to his feet . " I take my hides from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , held it inches from Clabbus 's mouth . The hunter did not shrink away , but he kept his silence . <p> " Your son is not in the swamp , " the creature said . " I repeat , you will find him where you took your last haul . " <p> Clabbus and the phib stared eye to eye for several seconds , and then the phib turned and strode toward the street . At the edge of the deck , he leapt ; the mud swallowed him . <p> " Oh , Destroyer , " Clabbus swore . " What now ? The phib 's insane . The whole damned race of them  --  <p> " But Father , Jezzle 's alive ! " Taian 's face was bright again . " Somewhere , they have him ! " <p> " Yes , girl , yes , yes  --  but he could be anywhere . " <p> The other hunters , tearing their eyes from the mud , moved closer to where Clabbus and Taian stood . They were full of advice . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamp ! . . . I know that phib  --  let me hunt him down ! " <p> " It makes no sense , " Clabbus said . " None at all . " <p> " Father , " Taian whispered . But he ignored her , swallowed up by his associates , each of them presenting a plan . She moved toward Gorlen . " Let 's get him inside  --  this is not what he needs . " <p> Gorlen took one of Clabbus 's arms and Taian took the other . " Good people , " Gorlen said , " fine hunters , I am sure Clabbus appreciates all your wisdom and warnings . " He and Taian began to draw her father toward the door . " And he will no doubt call on all your talents to assist him when a course of action has been decided . But for the moment , please , leave a father to his grief . I thank you . " <p> With that , they drew him backward through the door into the building ; <p> Gorlen slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Who the hell are you ? " <p> The landlord stood in the hall , eager to keep all others out . He latched the door and Taian thanked him . They headed toward the stairs . <p> " Insane , " Clabbus kept saying . " He 's dooming my son through his madness  --  my son ! I did nothing to him ! He 's not a pure phib ! He 's not what I hunt ! " <p> " Father , " Taian said , " please be quiet and listen . Listen to me now , and you 'll hear what you know to be true , though I have never yet heard you admit it . But tonight you will admit it  --  or else lose your son . Father ? " <p> " I 'm listening , " he growled . They had reached their landing , and reentered the apartments through the open door . It was cold in the house , for a wind blew down the hall from the balcony . Drying hides fluttered and the smoke of the curing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony door . Returning to the parlor , he found Taian stroking her father 's hair , kneeling before him while he sat in his chair by the fire . <p> " You know it is true , " she said . <p> " I know no such thing . Those are rumors the halfbreeds spread to cause riots and discontent . They want only chaos and bloodshed and the wreck of Dankden . " <p> " Father , I 'm telling you , friends of mine have witnessed certain hunters at this evil work  --  men you know , men you grew up with , men you call your brothers . That 's why you refuse to face the truth . " <p> " Lies ! " <p> " Do n't be so stubborn ! I 've tried to open your eyes , but . . . " <p> " They 're right ! It 's a trap ! If I were to go where that phib implies , it would only be a trap ! " <p> " Maybe they want you to see with your own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years now . " <p> " I wo n't hear it , " he said . <p> She rose in a fury and tumed to Gorlen . " He will hear it . He 's heard it before . There are hunters he knows quite well , men I once called uncle , men who disgrace their calling  --  who mock the art and science of it alike . Men too lazy or ignorant to track the phibs in the swamps , or trap them in their dens . Since the phibs have thinned away , and the living has become a hard one , there are men spoiled by so many fat years in Dankden that they no longer bother to venture into the knuckleroot groves . " <p> " Do n't listen to my daughter , " Clabbus said , but his heart was not in his voice . " It 's madness . " <p> She lowered her voice , clenching tight to Gorlen 's black hand . " Yes , it is madness . These men hunt in Dankden , Gorlen . In the slums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grottos where the young and senile are often left to fend for themselves . These so-called hunters prey on the halfbreeds . Half human ! Our kin ! " <p> " No , no , nooooo , " Clabbus said , as if he were weary of denying it . " Father , you know it is so . What of the body we saw tonight ? The very mother who bore that child carried the evidence here for you to see . She was no purebreed phib . " <p> " But I did n't slay that child ! " her father said with a racking sob . <p> Taian only stared at him and did not answer . When he slumped , face in his hands , she glanced sidelong at Gorlen . He moved out of the parlor , and a moment later she followed , shutting the door behind her . <p> " He must admit to himself what he 's long suspected , " she whispered . " But he 's begun to do it , and I 'm proud . Now he will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . " Jezzle will be resumed to us . " <p> " I wish there was something I could do , " he said . " As a stranger here , I  --  " <p> " As a stranger , you make me see Dankden through your eyes . There 's a sickness here which must be cured before it kills us all . " <p> " Whatever you may need me for , please , rely on me , " he said . <p> She started to take his hands , both of them , but at that moment they heard a groan from beyond the door . It opened and Clabbus appeared , all weakness banished from his eyes . <p> " All right , " he said . " I 'll talk to them . I 'll make them take me where they went today . " <p> " I know this is hard for you , " Taian said . <p> " No . . . no , it is suddenly very easy . The fact that none of them has come to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . they are disgusting to me now . They know where my boy is hidden , but they say nothing , more concerned with protecting their pathetic and illegal trade . I will find it very easy to convince them now . " <p> He stalked past them down the hall , and Taian turned to look at Gorlen , her eyes flashing with pride . " You see ? " <p> " Come along ! " Clabbus called . " Your brother 's waiting ! " <p> Taian threw her arms around Gorlen , and then released him , running . Once again he was left to find his own way down the stairs . <p> Crouching low in the sloshing dark at the back of the boat , Gorlen wished for a phib skin of his own . It had begun to rain again  --  and not a light rain , but a torrent . His boots were full , and where he knelt in half a foot of water , he might as well have been swimming alongside the boat . Meanwhile , Taian , likewise crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , rotten sagging piles of swollen wood in comers of which the dimmest lights burned with a sodden , sullen glow . Figures huddled near the flames , wide-mouthed , their flesh streaked gray and blue and sometimes violent red . It was hard for him to believe anyone could live here . Though few other boats navigated the swirling streets , he sometimes saw rounded objects breaking the surface , blowing bubbles , sinking again . Swimmers , he realized . Boats , here , would be a luxury , and unnecessary for personal transport . <p> But there were two boats ahead of them , almost always lost from view in the shifting rain . Weak lanterns hung above the streets , tossed by the wind , most of them already doused or burned out ; they squeaked and rattled on their rusted brackets . Taian 's eyes were sharper than his , he supposed , for after they 'd drifted and dodged through a series of abrupt tums , the curtains of water might part for a moment and he 'd see the ones they followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay here until I return , " Clabbus had told her as he climbed into his own boat on the dock outside the Phibby Inn . And nodding to Gorlen he 'd added , " You make sure she does . " <p> In the other boat were two men Clabbus had pulled almost bodily from the inn , hide hunters with sour faces , who had sneered but finally acceded to his threats . Gorlen and Taian had stood at his shoulder among the crowded tables of the inn . All the hunters gathered there to drink hot plapioc must have known why Clabbus had come , but these two had been the least pleased of all to see him . <p> Taian and Gorlen had watched them scull ahead , guiding Clabbus 's boat away from the inn . The moment they cut round a comer , she 'd leapt down into a docked boat and signaled him to follow . <p> " I do n't trust him with them ! " she said . " Are you coming ? " <p> Gorlen gave an instant 's thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but figured that she knew the customs of Dankden far better than he . He jumped in beside her , losing his balance as she shoved away from the dock and toppling into the bottom of the boat ; there he stayed , for the most part , while she tracked the hunters . Gorlen peered up at the roofs passing by , at the dripping caves and tottering ledges . A bit of polished stonework would have stood out like an entire golden palace ; this was no place for a roving gargoyle to hide . Thus his visit to Dankden advanced his larger mission nothing ; but it did n't trouble Gorlen that he had delayed his search for the sake of another . At least the dark stoniness of his hand was not spreading ; in fact , although he could n't be completely certain , he imagined that it had receded slightly , leaving a bit more flesh around his wristbones . This gave him some solace , but he was pleased to remain with the beautiful Taian in any case . She was strong and proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone hand with cold fingers of flesh , wondering if he might reduce the blackness still further tonight  --  until nothing remained but the tip of one finger . How many times had he reduced the gargoyle 's affliction to one or two digits , and then , in a moment of recklessness , of greed or indulgence at the expense of another , felt the cold creep up in an instant and claim his hand again , threatening to swallow his forearm ? He was not a true gargoyle ; he could not survive as a being of pure stone . If ever the blackness touched his heart , he would die in an instant . Until he found the mineral beast who had thus cursed him , he must take care at every step to consider his motives , and never give in to so many of the whims that every other man obeyed without consequence . It would have been one thing if the stone were directly linked to his own true heart , his conscience , his soul  --  whatever one might call it . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have known in advance that he was disobeying his deepest nature . But the blackness was a gargoyle 's flesh , and responded in a gargoyle fashion to his acts . While generally the gargoyle conscience overlapped with his own , it was ultimately alien , unpredictable , unfathomable . Deeds he considered worthy might cam him another inch or two of blackness , while an act any human might have ruled treacherous would cause the blackness to recede . <p> He felt that in helping Taian he helped himself , and so far his stony hand had not hinted otherwise . If he could play a large enough role in freeing Jezzle , perhaps his fingers would freely wriggle again  --  he might actually pluck the eduldamer for her pleasure tonight , instead of strumming it so brutally ! He might stroke Taian 's cheek with skin as soft as hers , instead of icy adamant . <p> Suddenly the boat darted sideways into an alley . Taian grabbed the corner of a slimy wall and clung to it , peering back into the street . Gorlen crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was largely cut off , except at certain intersections where it whirled the rain about as in a hurricane . He could see , not far off , both boats drifting . Clabbus brought his coracle closer to the hunter 's boat , and one of them stepped in beside him . They appeared to be pointing at one of the buildings just ahead . The man alone in the hunter 's boat looked slowly around , until he was about to look directly at Taian and Gorlen . She pulled on his sleeve , and they ducked back out of sight . <p> " This must be the spot , " she whispered . " Unless the halfbreeds come to meet them , they 'll have to dive . I should have gone with my father  --  should have insisted . If he goes down , he leaves his boat in their care . They 've already proven they ca n't be trusted . " <p> " Perhaps we should announce ourselves , then , " Gorlen said . <p> " He would be furious if he knew we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to dive , it might be worth the risk . I do n't trust those two , either . " <p> Taian put a finger to her lips , then slowly peered around the wall again . Almost immediately she ducked back . <p> " They 're coming ! Quick ! " <p> She snatched up the pole and shoved them farther into the alley , deep into the dark , lapping recesses . A moment later , the hunter 's boat shot past , one man poling , the other looking back . Both were laughing . Gorlen waited for Clabbus to follow , but the men 's laughter faded away , and still there was no sign of Taian 's father . <p> The same thought must have come to them both at the same time , for even as Gorlen jumped to his feet , Taian pushed the boat forward . Once again he lost his balance and toppled  --  this time overboard . <p> He surfaced , choking , to see Taian looking down the avenue in confusion . Paddling , he followed her eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intersection . Without a moment 's indecision , she launched herself toward it . Gorlen graciously called , " Go ahead ! " <p> His own progress in the stagnant streets , with one hand so heavy , was maddeningly slow . Nor did he wish to abandon his boots , though they slowed him still further . It was with some surprise , then , that after kicking along in Taian 's wake , he paused for a moment 's breathing space and let his feet sink  --  and so touched bottom . <p> He stood on solid , if mucky , ground ; the watercourse was no more than five feet deep ; his mouth was just above water . Standing , he called to Taian , who now stared frantically into her father 's coracle : " It 's shallow ! " <p> Taian wheeled around in her boat , looking at the dark decayed buildings as if they could tell her something . She cupped her hands to her mouth . " Father ! " she cried . " Father ! " <p> Gorlen too began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no answer , and no sign of the big man swimming . Surely even a trained diver could not have stayed under for so long . <p> " Clabbus ! " he called again . <p> And at that instant , he became aware of countless wet faces watching them from the buildings all around , peering out of drowned doorways , out of water-filled rooms , looking down from the dripping frames of unrecognizable piles that might once have been cathedrals just as easily as warehouses . <p> There was a loud in-drawing of breath , an immense choking cough from somewhere inside those ruined structures . <p> " Father ! " Taian cried . <p> " So that 's who you are , " said a voice , sounding near though Gorlen could not see its source . The deep-throated coughing went on and on ; and it did indeed sound like Clabbus . " Playing games , all of you , trying to sneak in by some roundabout way ? This is n't where we said to come . " <p> " Please , " Taian called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not him you want  --  he keeps to the swamps , he 's proud of his skills , he respects you and your people ! We only want his son  --  my brother . " <p> " There 's plenty parents here who want their children back , sibs too , " the voice said , low and harsh . <p> " We did n't harm them ! The two who lured him here  --  they and their kind did that ! " <p> " While you looked the other way ? What is it with humans ? Why should we think it any kinder of you to hunt the pure amphibians , our swampland cousins ? Why do n't you go hunt apes instead ? " <p> " There are those who do , " Taian answered , her voice sinking almost to inaudibility . Gorlen heard it because he now stood beside the boat , his left hand on its rim . He had no clear impression of who addressed them , or where the speaker stood . None of the phib faces he saw seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable hate . <p> " Excuse me , " Gorlen said loudly , though it was his least wish to draw all that amphibian attention to himself . " Perhaps , as a stranger in Dankden , a more impartial party here , I can be of some service to both sides . " <p> " Impartial ? " said the sneering voice . " What human is impartial ? You travel with hunters , the very ones who slay our children and our elders , the ones who rob our clutches to cure our flayed hides . " <p> " Fortune alone brought me into the gracious presence of Clabbus and his children ; I might as easily have ended up among your folk , had I come into Dankden from the swampy edge of town . Nor am I completely human ; I am , like you , a halfbreed . " <p> There were cries of disbelief from many gray-tongued mouths . Gorlen raised his right hand to silence them . <p> " My father was a gargoyle ! " he cried . " I have all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the kindest humans have welcomed me into their homes , as Clabbus has . I would speak for him and his children . " " They are part of the corruption here ! What hunter is not ? " <p> " I can not answer that , nor can I argue politics all night . I suggest some action be taken  --  some solution sought . " <p> Clabbus suddenly let out a groan . " Those hunters tried to drown me here , and make it look like your work , " came his muffled voice . " What other evidence do you need that I am their enemy ? " <p> " That does not make you our friend . " <p> " I only wish . . . for all of us . . . peace . That we may live together . I swear I 'll do my part to stop the illegal traffic in halfbreed hides . I am not without some influence in Dankden . " <p> " That is so , " the speaker replied . " Why do you think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Gorlen stepped away from the boat , his black hand in the air , mud sucking his boots from his feet . Well , let them go . He felt more agile barefoot , and he had the feeling he was going to be in liquid for awhile . <p> " Take me , " he said . " Let me visit the boy . Let Clabbus and his daughter , who are more familiar with the workings of the hide trade in Dankden , go back among their people and confront your murderers . I will be your hostage , with Clabbus 's son . " <p> He caught Taian staring at him ; he could not read her face , but he could feel something happening to his hand . . . a spreading tingle where before he had felt nothing . <p> Not now ! he thought . <p> He quickly shoved his hand beneath the water , aware that some discussion was going on in the ruins around him . Clabbus 's voice was part of it . Finally he heard the hunter say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so even if you did not hold my boy . " <p> A moment later , Clabbus emerged from the shadows , sloshing toward the boats . Taian poled toward him , knelt and put her arms out ; he was covered with waterweed and mud , but did n't bother to rinse himself . He clambered in quickly , embraced her , and turned as if it were an afterthought to Gorlen . " We 'll have you out soon , " he said . " Thank you , Gorlen . " <p> Gorlen started to raise his hand in acknowledgment , but saw as it broke water that the blackness had already receded halfway toward the first knuckle of his thumb . He was doing far too good a job . <p> " I 'm grateful I can help , " he said , keeping his hand down . <p> Clabbus tossed a looped rope to his coracle , drew it in and tied the two boats together ; then he seized the pole and started moving away from the intersection , down the avenue that had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were in shock . " Be brave ! " she said . <p> The rain was worsening . Gorlen wiped it from his eyes , left-handed , and blinked around him into the gloom , so poorly lit by swinging lamps . He waited for some one or all of the amphibians to move , to walk forward out of the shadows and seal the bargain . Instead , cold fingers clutched abruptly at his legs , his arms , his shoulders ; swarming over him from all sides , they drew him under , giving him scarcely time to draw a breath . He should have known they moved faster underwater . <p> Thoughtfully , they brought him up for air every now and then , though never as often as he would have liked . He willed himself to relax , to let them drag him unresisting , to save his breath until he felt them rising , when he prepared to gasp as large a lungful as he could . The worst part of it was that gradually the liquid grew thicker and thicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest , as if he were being squeezed , and he could never quite breathe as deeply as he needed to . And then panic began to overtake him , so that he could no longer keep himself calm , but began lashing out and trying to hold himself above the surface for longer periods  --  though his struggling simply made it harder for him to get the air he needed . <p> Finally , they held him under far too long . His struggles mounted until , sparks exploding in his eyes , he began to lose consciousness . It was then that he felt rain on his face , washing the mud away , and he sucked in a desperate draft of air ; and then another , and another . He opened his eyes and saw above him the intricately tangled silhouettes of plants . The phibs were towing him through water , among enormous looming trees . It was not only rain that washed him , but water pouring from the leafy canopy . Between breaks in the leaves he saw breaks in the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , that is , until the swamp grew denser and closed in from above . He supposed they were wise not to keep him in the town ; for all he knew , Clabbus 's words might simply spur the hunters of Dankden to a genocidal frenzy , send them poling down en masse to the watery ghettos , descending on all the wet lairs they suspected of holding treacherous halfbreeds , to relieve them a//of their hides . . . . Gorlen 's life would n't be worth much as ransom at that point , nor Jezzle 's . <p> Without waming , they dragged him under again . He went down sputtering , coughing up the bit of air he 'd chanced to have in his lungs . This time they were definitely pulling him deep down ; he did n't know how he could hold out . Then they shifted their grip on him , pushing him up , up into air  --  but this was a stifling atmosphere , clammy and oily , with a rotten edge that smelled as though the swamp were spoiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank ; they shoved him onto it . He lay there without moving , blinking to see if he could find any trace of clouds or stars  --  but the sky was black as a cave . <p> A cave , he thought . Close enough . This must be one of their dens . <p> He raised his hands to see if he could find a ceiling , but there was nothing . From the sloshing sounds and the hollowness of the voices around him , he knew he was in a closed chamber of some kind . He remembered what Taian had told him about never knowing what poisonous creatures might be inches away ; remembered that the hunters did exactly this for their livings , and shivered . He was thoroughly chilled anyway . He wondered how well they knew the needs of humans , if they would allow him to get warm and dry somehow . <p> " Hello ? " he ventured , to see if they would object to his questions . There was no reply , only further splashing . The voices had ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more . They 'd dropped him here and gone away . <p> Gorlen huddled for awhile on the wet bank , but as he grew colder , he decided that movement would be wiser . He went onto all fours , crawling away from the water , but had gone no more than a few feet when he bumped into a wall  --  a slimy mass of tightly tangled cords and cables textured like rubbery bark . He followed the wall until it led him back to water , within several body lengths . He could not imagine this was a true home  --  not even an amphibian 's . Nor did it bode well for his comfort . He had to clench his jaws to keep his teeth from chattering . <p> Suddenly there was a bubbling sound , and a choking breath . Coughing . Splashing . Gorlen drew back to the wall , trying to see anything , but failing . He did n't need vision , though , to recognize a boy 's curses . <p> " Jezzle ? " The boy grew quiet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled himself onto the bank . <p> " Is . . . is that you ? The bard ? " <p> " Gorlen , yes . " He moved toward the voice , put out his hand and felt the boy 's face ; he tightened his grip on Jezzle 's shoulder . <p> " But how 'd you get here ? " <p> Quickly Gorlen told him what had happened since Jezzle 's abduction . " They 'll work something out , " he promised . " I 'm sure of it . " <p> " Well , I 'm not waiting around , " Jezzle said . " If they think they can hold a hunter . . . . " <p> " Jezzle , be calm , be patient . It 's what your father and sister would want . " <p> " My pa hunts phibs , he does n't bargain with them ! You ca n't trust the halfbreeds , you idiot , they 're worst of all . We 've got ta get out of here before they come back and kill us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind . Why would they have left us here if they meant to kill us ? " <p> " Hell , nobody understands the phibs  --  they 're stupid animals . You 'll see what I mean when we swim out of here . " <p> " Swim  --  where ? " <p> " Down , out , and up . I do this all the time  --  swim into empty dens for practice , you see ? This is nothing to me . Are you coming ? " " I  --  I ca n't let you do that . I gave my word . " " You ca n't stop me , can you ? " <p> He did n't give Gorlen time to answer . He heard the boy hit the water . Gorlen pictured Taian 's reaction when she learned that he had let her brother go alone into the swamp . Try explaining diplomacy to a rash youth . . . . <p> Gorlen stood clumsily at the edge of the bank , filled his lungs with air , and dived . He felt relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den  --  at least , he felt sure until he found himself swimming into thickets of submerged rootwood . He clung to the roots in order to keep himself from succumbing to his one true desire , which was to bob back to the surface of the enclosed pool and await the return of those who held his life in their webbed hands . Resisting the temptation of a passive captivity , he squeezed the air from his lungs and dragged himself deeper , going hand over hand , flesh over stone . His head began to throb . Between the roots were spaces wide enough to accommodate him . One of them was the passage the phibs had taken . He thrust blindly through one promising opening and stroked desperately toward the surface , face tipped up so that he could suck air the instant he surfaced . He was discouraged , to say the least , when he plowed full-face into a root cluster . Thinking to swim around it , he struck out for open water - but found only more thick wooden cables enclosing him . Gorlen saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the throbbing pressure of his sinuses , he estimated that the surface was ten feet above  --  it might as well have been ten leagues . He clawed at the roots , telling himself he would not panic . The water , black until now , began to fill with streaming lights . A distant liquid music swelled in his ears as though an operatic riverboat were passing overhead . This developed into a rich , throaty vibration , a catfish purr . According to those who had been revived from the edge of watery death , drowning was almost peaceful once you gave in and inhaled the waters , once the body surrendered and let the soul drift free . Gorlen clung to this last hope as he opened his mouth and inhaled  --  <p> Warm , fishy air . <p> He nearly choked . Cold lips out of nowhere pressed tight to his own . Opening his eyes in disbelieving terror , he saw nothing . Nor could he move ; something powerful bound his arms to his sides , albeit without hurting him . Reflexively he breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was air enough to fill him . There was a rich taste in his lungs , an undercurrent to the clammy essence , some perfume that flooded his brain and seeped down his nerves like a whisper , nudging him with secret knowledge , eking out revelation on such a fine level that he felt his atoms were conversing with a stranger 's atoms . The mouth sealed to his own began a slight suction , encouraging his exhalation ; he gave up the stale air gladly . On the second inhalation B shallower , less desperate B his blinded eyes lit up with a vision of the swamp , all its tangled waterways cast through him like a glowing net whose intricacies were as homey and familiar as the sound of his own pulse . He knew his location : near the sea , not far from Dankden . Dankden ! Human town ! At the thought of the place , he felt a violent urge to flee at any cost , to swim and keep swimming until he had put that loathsome blot far behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was literally nowhere left to run . The swamps , once vast enough to remain uncharted even by their most ancient inhabitants , had dwindled alarmingly within the span of several generations ; encroached on by human dwellings , drained and poisoned and tamed by air-breathers , the swamps had been reduced to a few last drops . <p> Fear and frustration filled Gorlen ; he drank them in even as he withdrew from the verge of death . His heart rate slowed . He was sinking . dropping free of the root-clutches . He continued to breathe slowly , his savior somehow producing fresh air for him , none of it laced so powerfully with the visions of the first few breaths . His toes sank into bottom slime . His captor puffed him full of air , gently closed his lips to seal it in , then launched him up . He paddled weakly , limp but buoyant . Moments later he broke the surface , tasting wind and rain and a vast open night . He looked down but the black water betrayed nothing . Thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , he called quietly , " Jezzle ! " <p> The boy did n't answer in words ; instead , after a moment , Gorlen felt a hand on his arm . Then came Jezzle 's whisper : " Good , you came . Now we have to find our way toward the sea . From there we 're home free . " <p> " There 's an open channel just there , " Gorlen said . " If we can get into it , the tide will carry us out . " <p> " But the tide 's still at peak , " Jezzle said . " You ca n't even feel the swirl in here  --  and when it starts out , it just makes false eddies . " <p> " Do n't worry , " Gorlen said , sensing the swamp around him like a living map . " I know what I 'm doing . " <p> " How could you know ? You 're a bard ! Even my father 's been betrayed by the suck . " <p> Gorlen quelled a momentary impulse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste no time ; but more than that , his rescue seemed sublime , magical . He did not think he could find the words for it . . . not yet . <p> " We ca n't stay where we are , " he said . " You might as well have remained in the den , if you were n't willing to risk the tides . " <p> The boy fell silent . <p> " If you do n't want to follow me , fine , " Gorlen said . " But I 'm going now  --  toward the sea . " <p> He began to swim in what he knew was the right direction , and Jezzle  --  without a stronger opinion  --  followed . <p> As he swam , he felt no fear of the waters around him . Everything seemed quite different since his entry into the swamps , when every shadow had threatened . He knew there were dangers here , but he also knew how to recognize them . The hardest thing of all was to keep heading toward the dark spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the city of Dankden . In his heart , Gorlen wanted only to flee the place ; but he owed the boy a safe journey home . He still had hopes of seeing Taian again , and of achieving some kind of reconciliation among the phibs and their hunters . <p> They moved into steadily wider channels , the trees ever thinner around them , until at last they emerged in a wide tidal flat , with open sea ahead of them , and juts of mist-hung rock standing up beyond the waves . <p> " I ca n't believe it , " Jezzle said . " I know this place . How did you find it ? " <p> " Gargoyles have a faultless sense of direction , " he lied . " The curse carries with it a few advantages . " <p> They followed the treeline , sometimes clambering over sandbars as the tide receded , but mainly keeping to the trees . Gorlen 's sense of dread increased as they approached Dankden , which threw rays of sickly light out over the flats far ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmer some small distance into the swamp , among the trees , an image which made his heart sing with hope for reasons he did not fully understand , but which had something to do with the clammy breath of life he had received . " Look there ! " he called to Jezzle , and started off into the swamp until he reached the object of so much joy . This was a cluster of silvery wet globes , piled among the knotty strands of a knuckleroot , barely visible as the moon peeked out from the slight gap between clouds and horizon . <p> " How  --  how did you spot these ? " Jezzle said . Gorlen smiled inwardly at having impressed the boy with his superior knowledge of the swamps , although he did not yet understand exactly what he had found . Kneeling closer , he saw small swimmers inside each of the spheres . They seemed to sing to him in the silvery light . <p> He glanced over at Jezzle and saw that the boy was quietly , quickly stabbing the globes with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fertile ones , and perfectly ripe ! " Jezzle said . " If I only had a net to drag them home right now ! " <p> " What are you doing ? " Gorlen seized the boy 's elbow , but Jezzle tore away , confused . <p> " What do you mean ? I 'm fixing them . I 'll come back tomorrow for the harvest , but I ca n't let them grow any larger , can I ? " <p> " Why . . . why not ? " <p> " They 'll be ruined for curing , you idiot ! " <p> " Curing ? " <p> " What did you think they were for ? I ca n't wait to see pa 's face when I bring him here . " <p> Gorlen remembered the leathery globes Taian had tossed on the smoking fires that afternoon , to give the hides their finish . He 'd thought they were vegetables ! <p> Jezzle began puncturing more of the spheres . Gorlen leapt on him from behind , pulled the boy back and flung him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? " Jezzle said , spitting with fury . <p> Gorlen did n't answer . He stared down at the swimming shapes trapped in the few undamaged globes remaining . A generation of pure phibs , massacred . Sickness filled him . He rounded on Jezzle , saw a greed much larger than one boy  --  and held his tongue . <p> " There 's no time for this , " he said in a deadened voice , seizing Jezzle by his elbow and dragging him to his feet . " It 's more important to get you home safe to your father . " <p> " You 're no hunter , " Jezzle said . <p> " Give me your knife . " <p> " What ? " <p> Gorlen twisted Jezzle 's wrist till the knife dropped . He stooped to pick <p> it up , then knelt to press the tip against one of the spheres . <p> " Watch my hand , " he said . <p> " Your hand  --  hey , the stone 's nearly gone . What happened ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why I 'm no hunter . Why I can not kill . " <p> The knife blade quivered , sending ripples across the wet spherical surface . The small shape inside stirred and seemed to move toward the point , as if it were a parent . Gorlen waited ; he pressed slightly , and waited again . Waited for the advance of stone , but felt nothing . Pressed harder , till thick clear liquid began to spill down the blade toward his fingers  --  fingers that steadfastly refused to turn to stone . <p> He yanked the knife away , hoping it was not too late . " I do n't understand , " he said . The egg continued to leak . <p> " Give me that , " Jezzle said , snatching at the knife . He then buried it in the egg and pulled it out again . The swimmer was dead . " You only wounded it , Gorlen . At least be quick . " <p> Gorlen stared at his hand , the black tip that refused to claim more of his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You gargoyle conscience ! " <p> " You 're right , though , " Jezzle said . " We should get back ; these 'll keep overnight . " <p> This time it was Jezzle who dragged Gorlen to his feet . <p> " Are you okay ? You look sick . " <p> " I 'll be all right , " Gorlen said . <p> " I said it before : You 're no hunter . " <p> The moon dipped below the horizon , consigning them once more to darkness by the time they had reached Dankden from the seaward side . At low tide , Dankden looked like a different town completely . The streets were draining toward the ocean and the swamps ; lower tiers of stepping stones and even muddy cobbles were revealed ; fish flopped and eels curled in accidental pools . The stilts beneath most buildings were thickly furred with brown and green weeds ; clusters of gold bulbs dangled from the pilings ; barnacles hugged up tight inside their conical shells , though it did them little good when the harvesters came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit  --  in addition to the lamps  --  by a leaping orange light that played upon the low clouds , outlining the rooftops , coming from some distant part of town . It was with a sinking sense of failure that Gorlen recognized the tossing glow . He had seen more than one city in flames . <p> " That 's coming from the phibby slums , " Jezzle said as they sloshed along . " I knew my pa would n't let them off . " <p> " It could n't have been Clabbus , " Gorlen assured him . " He has enemies , you know . " <p> " Hunters stick together ! Yeeaah ! " Jezzle broke off running toward the center of the conflagration . <p> Alone , Gorlen moved more slowly , like one doomed . If there was anything he had learned in this life , it was when to leave . He would claim his eduldamer , purchase a new pair of boots , and set out . Perhaps a farewell kiss to Taian , more likely not . Even she  --  lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and wondered why each year the swamps held fewer phibs . Nothing he did here would matter in the least . He had not managed even to play the part of a hostage . <p> There were plenty of folk in the streets ; they seemed more merry than concerned , as if the fire were the main event at a festival . The tide would return , and it was starting to rain again . They , at least , were safe . <p> He asked the way to Clabbus 's house , and eventually found a man who knew the hunter . When he pounded on the outer door , the landlord recognized him from earlier in the evening , and let him in to find his way up the dark stairs which he now knew he would never climb often enough to master . <p> In Clabbus 's apartment , the smoke-stench of curing hides repulsed him , but he pushed through them in search of his belongings , which he had left near the fireplace . As he straightened , his bags slung over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway . She was wrapped in her phib hide , pale face streaked with mud . She seemed shocked to see him . <p> " I  --  I 've brought your brother back , " he said . <p> " Something horrible has happened ! " <p> " I guessed as much . But Jezzle 's safe . I think he went to find your father . " <p> Moving like a woman carved of knucklewood , Taian crossed the room and sank down in Clabbus 's chair before the coals . <p> " We went to the Phibby Inn , " she said . " It was a riot there . Everyone believed the phibs had murdered my father . They were gathering to descend on the halfbreeds , to destroy them in their slums . When we appeared , it should have stopped them ; they should have seen how they 'd been lied to . But . . . it did n't even matter . They did n't want the truth . They wanted to do what they 'd been set on all along . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care that you and Jezzle might be out there . " <p> Gorlen sank down next to her . He put his right hand on her neck , barely noticing that even his fingers were flesh now , flesh almost down to their glossy black tips . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> " I  --  I came back for some things , " she said . " Then I 'm leaving . " <p> " I understand . Where will you go ? " <p> She shook her head . " I ca n't stay here , that 's all I know . Father can live with them or fight them as he wishes . He can take care of Jezzle , in any case . The boy wants nothing but to hunt . " She turned to Gorlen , her eyes wet . " They murdered halfbreeds in their homes , unless they were fast enough to flee to the swamps . But they 're not full phibs , Gorlen ! They 're dependent on Dankden . They ca n't survive out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling them halfbreeds is unfair . They 're people . People like us ! " <p> He pushed back her hood and stroked her hair , at last feeling the warmth in his fingers , flexing them in amazement . If he could only hold onto this feeling forever , the knowledge that he was doing the right thing no matter how hard ( although at this moment it felt so easy ) . . . . <p> " It 's all right , " he said . <p> She hid her face in her hands . " I saw  --  I saw a mother and her hatchlings  --  I mean , her children . She was so afraid that she was tearing them prematurely from their eggs , giving them the breath of life , and pushing them into the canal , hoping some few of them might swim to freedom . I saw them struggle and choke ; they floated past while I stood there , unable to save a one of them . " <p> " The breath . . . of life ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . " Phibs , even halfbreeds , are born underwater , " she said . " They take their first breath from their mother , who carries fresh air just for them , enough to get them to the surface . But these were too young . . . undeveloped lungs . . . " <p> " Good Goddess , " Gorlen whispered . He could taste the fishy life-giving air again , the breath that had saved him in the root cage , and imbued him with an inner , living map of the swamp . Closing his eyes , he could sense the swamp so near . . . could sense also where it once had been in its primordial state , claiming the very soil where Clabbus 's home now stood . He carried the swamp inside him , as if some compass needle had been activated in his head . The phibs must have had some homing instinct , a gift from their mothers  --  would have it even once their home had been destroyed . And now it was his as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went , he would feel the swamp somewhere behind him , dying , doomed , crying out . . . until it was silenced . And even then , he would hear its murdered ghost weeping . <p> He opened his eyes when he felt Taian lean against him . She was sobbing . His preternaturally sensitive fingers moved in her hair , feeling every strand . She was cold , and his first impulse was to warm her , but he was colder still , and wet from the swamps . They moved together , closer to the glowing coals . <p> " I must leave , " she said in his ear . " Before my father returns . I must go now , before I lose my determination . " <p> " Yes , " he said , but his heart was quickening , and he sensed that hers was too . " I 'll go with you . I know the roads . " <p> " No , " she said . " I must go alone . It 's the only way . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Please , Gorlen . I  --  I ca n't wait . I ca n't take the time . " <p> Gorlen bit back words . He wanted to stroke her , to feel her nakedness beneath her cloak . He wanted the warmth between them to build to a fire ; he wanted the time to spend with her , but there was none . <p> " Please , " she said , but he could n't bear to let her go . He reached for her as she spun away ; reached , knowing that if he could grab her wrist , she would not resist him . Reached  --  <p> And felt his hand turn to stone . <p> " Ohhhh . . . . " <p> It was a weary , drawn-out groan . From across the room , having easily eluded a hand that could not grasp , Taian looked back with concern . " What is it ? Gorlen , you understand , do n't you ? " <p> " Of course , " he said , pulling black stone fingers back into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Go , now . I 'll explain to your father as best I can . It 's your choice . He 'll understand , Taian . " <p> She hesitated . <p> " Go on , " he said . " Quick ! While you 're determined ! " <p> Taian smiled , blew him a kiss , and then he heard her on the stairs . He jumped to his feet and ran down the hall to the outer balcony . He watched her walk out onto the street , anonymous in her dark cloak of phib hide , in the rain , clutching a traveling sack . Low-tide was short-lived ; already the streets were awash . <p> " Good luck , Taian , " he said quietly . " May we meet again , when we both have the time . " <p> A cold gust kept carrying rain over the balcony , but he was already as wet as it was possible to get . He looked at the dried globes stacked by the smoker , and shivered in his soggy cloak of common cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward he would never wish for anything finer . <p> He drew back his damp sleeve and raised his right hand . Obdurate , stony , inky adamant fixed in the act of grasping . <p> " You fool , " he said , as if it were something apart from himself . <p> <p> <p> By Marc Laidlaw <p> Marc Laidlaw last appeared in our June I994 issue with his horror story , " The Black Bus .

I wrote a Gorlen novel ( Mistress of Shadows ) in high school and destroyed it in college . I did n't think about Gorlen much for the next dozen years , and then one day I was sitting at my computer wondering what to write ; I closed my eyes and there he was , walking down a drowning avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
