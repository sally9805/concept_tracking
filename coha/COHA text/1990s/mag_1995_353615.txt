After a week of negotiation , there came a day in April when the first major spending-cut bill of the G.O.P. Congress had reached a delicate final stage . That was when someone in the Senate cloakroom handed a slip of paper to Trent Lott of Mississippi , the second-ranking Senate Republican . On it was a column of figures  --  the Democrats ' final offer . Lott looked it over and paused . " I guess the only thing left to do is check this with the leader , " he said . That would not be necessary . Poring over the numbers with him was a weary-looking blond woman in sensible Ferragamo pumps . Without hesitation she told him , " Dole 's O.K. on this . " <P> The woman with the power to give Dole 's on-the-spot approval was his chief of staff , Sheila Burke , 44 , a former registered nurse  --  and former liberal-leaning Democrat . By virtue of her power to speak for the majority leader and negotiate on his behalf , Burke is the most powerful woman on Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House if her boss becomes the next President . The remarkable thing about Burke 's working relationship with Dole is that she enjoys the complete trust of a man who does not offer it easily . And she possesses a rare understanding of a character unfathomable even to colleagues who have dealt with him for decades in Congress . " My goal is to do what Dole needs , " she says with typical understatement . " I basically think I do a good job . " <P> In the months to come , Dole will be relying on her more than ever as he attempts the two biggest feats of his career : winning the White House while still leading the Republican revolution in the Senate . Accordingly , he has handed Burke the largest challenge of her own career by plunging her into the Senate fight over welfare reform , which has become as much a contest between moderates and conservatives within the G.O.P. as it is between Republicans and Democrats . It 's the G.O.P. standoff that has kept a welfare-reform bill even from reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been debated this week . For the most dedicated conservatives , a bill that penalizes out-of-wedlock pregnancy is a non-negotiable demand . And for them Burke is the obstacle . <P> By blasting Hollywood and sabotaging Henry Foster 's nomination as Surgeon General , candidate Dole has succeeded so far in courting the no-compromise Republican right . But because of his long years as a Senate dealmaker , the party 's most insatiable conservatives still have deep misgivings about Dole . In recent weeks they have been venting them on Burke , the person most likely to run his White House as chief of staff or steer social policy as Secretary of Health and Human Services . It is nothing short , says Burke , of " an orchestrated effort to get Dole to remove me from my job . " Dole says that will not happen and bristles at suggestions that she somehow controls him . " I do n't know if any of these people know Sheila or know what she does , ' ' he told Time . " She does n't have any agenda , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' <P> Burke 's enemies , however , see her as Dole 's bad angel , the woman who urges on his predisposition to compromise . Not for Dole is Margaret Thatcher 's credo that consensus is the negation of leadership . And not for Burke . Beyond that , some are even casting her as a Beltway Lady Macbeth-the wily , power-hungry woman who works her ( secretly liberal ) will through a feckless politician .
