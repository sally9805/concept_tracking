<p> As Engine No. 142 pulls out of the CSX Transportation terminal in Atlanta , the wooden arms on the rail crossing ahead begin to lower . Red lights flash , and bells sound warning the cars on Thurmond Street that the milelong CSX freight train is approaching . <p> A few hundred feet from the crossing , a small black and white " W " posted alongside the tracks reminds engineer Bob Sugar to begin blowing the train 's whistle . The deep , mournful sound gives drivers and pedestrians a last chance to get off the rails before the train chugs through . Thirty-seven years driving trains has braced Sugar for the motorists who will try to make a last-second dash around the wooden barriers . <p> " It is a terrible thing to see somebody out there and know you wo n't be able to stop , " he says as an impatient pickup truck driver darts out in front of the train . The small green truck swerves around the guardrail to cross the tracks . <p> Time was , once northbound trains got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open rail unencumbered by development and rarely slowed by people or traffic . The trains could travel miles through Cobb County without passing a single house or crossing a major road . The only congestion was in downtown Marietta and Kennesaw , where a handful of cars would back up on either side of the tracks to wait for the train to pass . <p> Today , it 's hard to tell where the city ends and the suburbs begin . Industry lines the rails near the Chattahoochee River , where trains leave Fulton County to enter Cobb . Apartments and $ 300,000 houses nearly abut the rails in the popular Oakdale community . <p> When freighters pass through , the traffic on Paces Ferry Road lines up nearly to I-285 . <p> Cobb County , which came to life nearly 150 years ago along this very railroad line , now struggles to coexist with it . Since 1980 , Cobb 's population has ballooned from 300,000 to 550,000 . More importantly , Cobb has more than half a million registered vehicles , and 12 intersections where they have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have realized in recent months , it 's a situation that can only get worse . Both Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads are eyeing the county as a practical location to expand their business . In the next three to five years , CSX expects to double the number of its trains  --  from about 50 to more than 100  --  that travel the 50-mile corridor between Atlanta and Cartersville . <p> " Before , it was the lifeblood of the community , " said Denny Meier , a Cobb County transportation engineer . " Now it 's , ' How do we get along ? ' " <p> Headed out of the city into Cobb County , Engine No. 142 and its cars snake past the Georgia Power plant , where trains frequently leave boxcars filled with coal on a spur track near the plant . Coal is the No. 1 commodity that CSX transports , said David Ingoldsby , the company 's train master for the northwest Georgia line . <p> The trains move no faster than 35 miles per hour all the way through Cobb . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain along the river make it physically impossible for the heavy freight trains to go any faster . Increased development and automobile traffic in recent years have forced the trains to move slower in other sections of the county as well . <p> It is the Chattahoochee River , whose steep banks force a slow pace , that has prevented this state-owned land from being used as a commuter rail line between the county and Atlanta . That 's fine with CSX . Passenger trains further slow the freight trains that already can wait hours on spur tracks for their turn to use the single rails through parts of Cobb County . <p> A train can spend up to 12 hours getting through Cobb County , Ingoldsby said , depending on the number of other trains waiting in line . Like I-75 during rush hour , there 's also the possibility of a delay on the tracks because of accidents or engine problems . <p> As if to demonstrate the point , Sugar grinds Engine No. 142 to a standstill off Atlanta Road just east of Smyrna . Dispatch says another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train 's boxcars as Sugar pulled out of the terminal . Sugar and train conductor David Cross climb down from the engine 's cabin and walk back to check it out and make sure the cargo is intact . The train idles on the track for a half hour while Sugar investigates . <p> Delays , and the potential for delays , are what CSX is trying to eliminate . The 50-mile stretch linking Atlanta to Cartersville is the company 's busiest track and one of its most important . <p> Nearly 60 trains a day now use the rail , CSX 's most direct connection between Midwest industrial cities , such as Chicago and Detroit , and the Southeast . Every new General Motors automobile sold in metro Atlanta gets to the dealerships through Cobb County on the CSX line . <p> " We 've probably got 70 million tons a year on it , " said Jim Kittrell , CSX resident vice president . " That 's one of the main arteries . " <p> To stay competitive , CSX has to move more trains faster . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second set of tracks to the rail corridor between Smyrna and Marietta . In the next three to five years , the company plans to add a second set of tracks the rest of the way through Cobb , to Cartersville . The expansion will allow the railroad to put more trains on the tracks daily  --  more than 100 by 2003 . <p> Over the past decade the Southeast has seen a resurgence in train transportation . <p> In 1980 the federal government effectively deregulated the rail industry , allowing rail freight companies to compete more fairly with the trucking industry . Businesses that for years had shipped inventory solely by trucks found they could ship more goods over longer distances for less money by train . <p> CSX became a major player in the rail transportation network , with operating income reaching a record $ 1.23 billion in 1997  --  a 9 percent increase over 1996 and a 16 percent increase over 1995 . <p> In metro Atlanta , CSX operates an automobile distribution center , where new cars arrive to be dispersed to surrounding dealerships ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the backs of tractor-trailer trucks and put on flatbed rail cars ; and a bulk transfer station , where goods are transferred between trucks and boxcars . <p> Norfolk Southern , the other major player in the eastern U.S. rail transportation system , also operates intermodal , bulk transfer and auto distribution terminals in metro Atlanta . Both companies have massive rail yards in Atlanta , where trains are switched out , serviced and routed to the next destination . <p> More and more businesses are using the rails to ship goods from manufacturers to local merchants . Tennis shoes and stereos reach local department stores after they 're unloaded from containers at bulk transfer stations . CSX trains deliver packages for United Parcel Service , carry rocket boosters to NASA , and supply Florida orange juice to Midwestern grocers . Life near railroads Residents are feeling the impact of the train industry 's growth  --  and not just when they 're shopping . <p> In the trendy Vinings community , developers are building expensive homes on craggy hillsides next to the railroad . Trains pass by swing sets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road back up to the tracks . <p> There are few undeveloped stretches of land between the Chattahoochee and downtown Marietta , where four lines of track offer a place for trains to pull off and wait their turn to continue . Twice an hour the clash between cars and trains brings traffic on Whitlock Avenue and Polk Street to a standstill off the Marietta Square . <p> More than the traffic , it 's CSX 's expansion plans that have Cobb residents upset . As the company prepares to add more tracks  --  and more trains  --  it wants to close highway-rail crossings . It 's a move that would eliminate the risk of car-train collisions , and allow trains to move through the county faster . <p> But in west Cobb County , where new roads have already reached their capacity , that decision is n't going over well . <p> In September , residents packed a county commissioners meeting to oppose a request by CSX to close three roads to eliminate railroad crossings . <p> " If our access were deterred in any way , we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harrison spoke out against closing Marble Mill Road , a primary access for several Marietta industries . " And we do n't have the biggest trucks on the roadway . " <p> Wink Winkenhofer spent hours outside a Kennesaw convenience store collecting signatures from residents opposed to closing the Stanley Road crossing . There were 1,500 names on the petition he gave county commissioners in September . <p> " We ca n't build new roads here in Atlanta , " said Winkenhofer , who wants to open a new funeral business near Stanley Road and Old Highway 41 . Closing the crossing would eliminate his access to Stilesboro Road . " Let 's not close what we have . " <p> In The Reserve , a subdivision of $ 500,000 brick homes built the length of a football field from the tracks , the proposal to close Mossy Rock Road nearly split the community . About half the residents opposed the closing , and the rest were in favor of it . <p> For those opposed , the biggest issue was convenience . Mossy Rock , which provides residents access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the swim-tennis community . The other road leads to Old U.S. 41 . <p> " I live a mile from the other entrance , " said homeowner Ted Vonck . " Depending on where I 'm going it can add 2.7 miles to get to where I would have been if I 'd gone out at Mossy Rock . " <p> Vonck , whose home is one of the closest in The Reserve to the rail line , says homeowners clearly knew the tracks were there when they bought land in the lush tree-filled subdivision next to the old battlefield . <p> " The railroad track , the horns , the whistles , the noise were all factored in when we made a decision to live out here , " Vonck said . <p> Residents in favor of the closing said they had expected the crossing to be eliminated when they built their homes . In letters to CSX officials , county engineers indicated they would consider closing Mossy Rock once Barrett Parkway was built . Barrett was completed last year . <p> " We made the decision to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowner Joanna Winslow said . <p> County commissioners voted not to close Mossy Rock and Stanley roads . Marble Mill Road wo n't be closed unless the county can find a way to divert the truck traffic out of the industrial area without sending it into nearby residential neighborhoods . <p> " In a perfect world , if we could eliminate all the crossings , that would be ideal , " Commission Chairman Bill Byrne said . " But as fast as that area is growing , it would appear to me that the dumbest thing we could do is close existing roads and expect people to be accommodated . " Hazardous crossings In recent years , county officials have attempted to work with the railroads to eliminate hazardous rail crossings wherever possible . School buses , for example , are prohibited from using some roads that cross the tracks at particularly dangerous locations . <p> New roads are designed to pass over or tunnel over the railroads . In addition , Cobb County has spent millions in recent years to reroute existing roads over or under the tracks . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 3 million to $ 5 million to separate the rail from the road , said Meier , the county engineer . <p> There 's a cost to the community as well . When commissioners agreed this year to reconstruct Tower Road in west Marietta to eliminate a rail crossing and improve motorists ' access to I-75 , they chose a route that would run through Pilgrim Baptist Church . The small , concrete-block church will be torn down when construction starts on that project , possibly as early as next year . <p> Despite the conflicts , county officials say rails benefit Cobb and surrounding counties , by providing an alternative to truck traffic . <p> The more 18-wheelers taken off metro Atlanta highways , the better chance the area has for improving its air quality , said Wayne Hill , chairman of the Atlanta Regional Commission . <p> A 75-car train can carry the load of 75 tractor-trailer trucks . Piggyback the train cars  --  stacking the cars atop one another  --  and you 've taken 150 trucks off the road . <p> " We 've got to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pushed the ARC to investigate both passenger and freight options for North Georgia . " If it works , we need to get on with it . " <p> Too , there are the historians and romanticists who recognize the rail development as key to the success of the region . Tom Scott teaches history at Kennesaw State University  --  near the site of the great Civil War train chase and the museum that now houses the famous hijacked locomotive , the General . <p> From the front porch of his home on Atlanta Road in Marietta , Scott can hear the whistle sound as the train approaches , followed by the rumble of the freight cars along the steel tracks . <p> " I love to hear the whistles . I love to hear the train go by , " Scott said . " I hope the whistles keep blowing forever through Marietta . " <p> Traffic backs up through downtown Marietta as one of many trains rumbles through . / CELINE BUFKIN / Staff Photo CSX 8281005294209 : A pedestrian railroad crosswalk west of the Marietta square in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city wants to reopen it . / CELINE BUFKIN / Staff Graphic : DANGER : RAILROAD CROSSING Here 's a look at highway-rail crossing incidents in Georgia since 1992 : Year ..
