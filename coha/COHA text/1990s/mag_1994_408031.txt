IN THE WEEK BEFORE FATHER 'S DAY LAST year , I did a publicity tour for a book I had just had published about fatherhood , called From Here to Paternity . One of the first stops on the tour was a popular noon - time radio phone - in show in Toronto , whose host had asked any fathers listening to call in if there was " something about being a father they 'd wanted to talk about , that they 'd never felt comfortable discussing before . " I was worried I 'd be hearing a lot of dead air through my headset , but the response turned out to be remarkable , and moving ; it was as though fathers all over the country had been sitting by their telephones waiting to unburden themselves . Most of the calls were an unusual mixture of the intense and the banal  --  evocations of nighttime vigils and daytime idylls , of watching kids sleep and listening to them tell jokes , all recalled with unabashed sentimentality . But it was the sixth call that really caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , Jay , this is Murray not his real name . The Murray you know . " And it was in fact the Murray I knew . On the other end of the line was a very good friend of mine , the male half of a couple I 'd known for more than 15 years . To say I was rattled would be mild ; it was only the second radio show I 'd been on , and already I was getting gag calls . While I sweated , though , Murray kept talking : " I 've always wanted to ask you this , but I never got around to it . I seem to walk around worrying all the time that I 'm making terrible mistakes in being a father , and that my kids are going to pay for it . I have this consistent fear that I 'm making the wrong decisions , that I 'm screwing up terribly . I wondered if you ever felt that way , or if other fathers did . " Figure not transcribed It was anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbled answer , assuring the listeners that Murray was a terrific father , I was thinking there was something extraordinary about his question . For one thing , I was sure he would never have asked it , at least not sober , in person  --  somehow the anonymity of the radio had let him be more intimate . Secondly , his worry was foreign to me ; in fact , if anything my attitude to parental blunders had been blithe in the opposite direction . ( I 'd always figured that if I was trying to do the right thing , that was enough . ) But most important , Murray had hit uponsomething I 'd never heard addressed formally before fathers ? Were contemporary fathers becoming more uncertain about being parents ? Or were they just more comfortable admitting it ? How did they feel about their parenting skills in general ? Was there a martyr - ready " guilty father " syndrome in the making , or was the terra still firma beneath our parental , paternal feet ? THE ANECDOTAL " RESEARCH " I did myself over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . Of the two dozen or so fathers I talked to ( all roughly Baby Boom age ) , slightly fewer than half expressed an attitude toward parental performance even blither than mine . Not only did they rarely worry about " making mistakes " as fathers , or " screwing up their kids for the future , " they rarely thought about the issue at all . As one of them , a 42 - year - old father of three ( ages five , ten and 12 ) told me : " I guess I operate on the ca n't lose method : whatever I do with my kids  --  discipline , losing my temper  --  I either automatically figure I 'm right , or even if I 'm wrong it ca n't do that much damage . I think my father did the same thing with me . He would n't have understood the word " traumatic . ' ' " Figure not transcribed The slim majority of the dads I surveyed , though , conveyed the diametric opposite ; they had a lot more in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary decisions they had to make ( interestingly , more with daughters than with sons ) , rarely felt totally sure of what they 'd decided to do , and in several cases even lost sleep about it ( in direct contrast to the " Theory of Relative Worry " I 'd floated in my book , with fathers talking about how worried they were and then falling asleep , and mothers saying nothing and then staying up all night writing notes to themselves ) . Common metaphors included a kind of vertigo , flying without a flight - plan , lack of a blueprint , missing the " tools . " It 's not that I do n't think there 's a right way of doing things , " one father put it , " it 's that I do n't know the basic way of finding it . Simple things are missing ; I 'm not walking into the exam naked , but without a pencil . " Another father  --  this one , interestingly , a high - school teacher himself , and the parent of a 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ( that is , someone I assumed would have been more than confident dealing with teenagers )  --  was in a way even more abject : I can do the same thing with , say , misbehaving kids in my class , and my own kids when they mess up , and I 'll feel totally justified in school and completely unsure at home . It 's not just because your own kids can pull your chain in a way other kids ca n't . Maybe it 's the fact that I 've got a handbook for behaviour at school , the one the board gives me and the one I 've written over the years myself , but I do n't have any handbook at home . And anytime I 'm feeling cocky about a decision , all my kids have to say is " You 're acting like a teacher , " or " You 're acting like our teacher , ' and I start wondering , maybe I am . Compared to my school kids , they 're a hundred times better at getting me to second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and grinned . " Here 's something else . I had this math teacher in junior high school I loved , an old giant of a guy , a complete tyrant . Whenever I think I 'm acting like him in class , it makes me smile . Whenever I think I 'm acting like my own father at home , it makes me cringe . Does that make sense ? " It did , although I could n't have said exactly why either . The uncertainty these fathers were expressing , it occurred to me , was a new father - specific brand : not remorse over precise oversights ( the maternal model ) , but anxiety over unknown ones . They were n't feeling crummy because they knew so much ; they were drowning because they knew ( they thought ) so little . HARD RESEARCH TO back up the anecdotal evidence I compiled is scanty  --  in fact there turns out to be virtually no literature on paternal guilt in any of the related disciplines  --  but clinical corroboration is something else . Dr. Lynn Oldershaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family therapy , suggests that a trend toward " paternal guilt " or " bewilderment " may be a result of the recent increase in paternal responsibility , without a concomitant increase in preparation . Figure not transcribed More and more men are being asked to share responsibility in parenting , yet many of these men have received little preparation for this role . Traditionally , males and females have been socialized differently , with females often receiving more direct instruction in caregiving than males . And what these males did learn about being a father they often learned from observing their own father , who typically assumed the role of playmate rather than caregiver . So now we ask males to be equal partners in caregiving , and many of these men may feel unprepared to do so . The resistance men sometimes have to asking for help may also add to the dilemma . Women have traditionally been " allowed " to ask for assistance when they 're at a loss ; men are often embarrassed to do so , fearing they 'll look weak or inadequate . Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role , they may actually end up feeling more inadequate . Dr. Frances Newman , a psychologist at The Toronto Hospital involved in what 's called " dynamic family work , " sees the possible trend from a slightly different angle : it may not be strangeness that breeds helplessness when it comes to raising kids , but familiarity . The problem for men is that they 're only lately becoming " familiar . " I 'm not sure whether I 've seen fathers feeling more guilty , " says Newman . " What I have seen is more fathers asking for custody of their children . Fathers  --  at least middle - class fathers  --  are far more involved , early on , than they used to be , in every aspect of parenting . I 'll notice young fathers saying " We ' when discussing abortion or pregnancy , and the interesting thing is it does n't seem like a misappropriation of voice at all , it seems just right . But that territory goes along with more questioning of your performance and adequacy as a parent , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll tell you if you 're doing all right , but younger kids ca n't tell you . Take the case of colicky babies , one of the worst sources of parental guilt around . Traditionally it was mothers who flagellated themselves for their kids being in pain with colic ; now that fathers are around it 's just as frustrating for them . The interesting twist on this is that it 's the father who 's not familiar with his kids who 's most likely to make major mistakes with them . Partly this is because fathers who spend very little time with their children when they 're young end up cultivating a feeling of detachment when it comes to both responsibility and influence . It makes paradoxical sense  --  it 's a lot easier to screw up a child if you assume you do n't have the power to do it . " What 's especially interesting about both psychologists ' viewpoints is something potentially radical neither articulates : whether there 's an overall trend to the condition or not , guilt , the psychological punching bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental dysfunction at all , but of health . In the getting of guilt we  --  fathers  --  may simply be coming of age as parents . To paraphrase Frances Newman , who is more likely to screw up a child , after all  --  a father who fears he will , or one who never gives the possibility a thought ? Once a month my ten - year - old son tells me about another dreaded vice  --  smoking or drinking  --  he 's worried that he 'll succumb to when he grows up . I try to tell him that the worry is his best defence , that it 's the unexamined life that is more likely to wreak brutalities , on himself or other people . " The fact that you 're asking just proves what a good guy you are , " I say . " You 're just a little crazy , too . " It 's only recently that I 've realized my advice to him does n't cast my own blitheness about fatherhood 's pitfalls in a very favourable light . I could probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife would agree . In fact , it has started to worry me , my lack of worry , which can only be a good sign . Not that I 'm close yet , to Murray or my son , in their qualifications as potentially exemplary modern dads : a couple of truly good guys , driven just a little batty by a healthy dose of doubt . In this case , contrary to the courtroom , the " guilty " father might be the best father of all . <p>
