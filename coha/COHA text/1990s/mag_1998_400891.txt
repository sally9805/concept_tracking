Where are you when the lights go out ? As your partner approaches you , does your mind cloud with dread ? Do you fear that intimacy will bring another disappointing experience for you and your co-conspirator ? Was it always this way , or did MS make it more so ? And now , because of your MS view of the world , do you really know anymore how the " healthy half " lives ? Having a chronic illness stinks . The Top fi List of Sexual Problems for Women with MS is as follows : * Fatigue - And fatigue and fatigue . * Decreased sensation - I just do n't feel it like I used to . * Decreased libido - I just do n't feel like it . * Decreased or absent orgasm - Even if I feel like it , I just do n't get it . * Difficulty with arousal - I just ca n't get into it . * Difficulty with vaginal lubrication Even if I feel like it , my body wo n't cooperate . As a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an orgasm during sex when I am not feeling well is very low on my list of priorities . Having sex when I am unwell rates down there with getting my teeth cleaned . It becomes a chore , something I am supposed to do , something that I am expected to do . Sorry all you flossers out there . The lights go out and I turn over to meet the land of blissful rest , when I feel a hand creeping down my back , wanting something . Waiting , my mind works overtime to reach for a solution that does not involve rejection . The last time , I remember , it actually was not bad . Now I remember , it actually was good . It made me feel beautiful and closer to my partner . It was the resolve to get there that was so hard . I remember thinking that I would log that feeling , save it , savor it so the climb to come together , to be intimate would not be a struggle . But , here we are again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We talked about each other 's needs . One of us needs longer to warm up . I ca n't trust the way I feel in that part of my body anymore . Rather than pleasure , there are pins and needles , and sometimes it 's just pain . " I did n't know that , " my partner said . " How could I ? " And it 's true . How could he ? A magic moment opens up and we are able to share . Long into the morning ( I have more energy in the morning so it 's a better time to make love ) we share our secrets of what creates pleasure in each of us . It 's like discovering and speaking a new language . Most of all I share my fears . What if I 'm in a mess when it 's all over-will I be embarrassed ? Will it be worth it ? Why is this whole thing such a struggle ? Moving tubes , needing so long to get to a climactic stage . Why do n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ? Well , the audience would need too much patience . There would be too much weirdness , too much discomfort . I know this but still the movies shape many of our expectations of what should happen . In the past , we might have participated proudly in expressing our sexuality . So what can we do to put some control back into the equation ? * We can talk about our fears and feelings with our partner . Sharing them in a noncharged environment . Sharing the things that help . As much as we would like someone to know our needs telepathically , generally that just is n't going to happen . * We can plan for moments of intimacy We can enhance those moments with things that smell nice , candles that glow romantically , music that suggests electric calm . * We can avoid unrealistic expectations . We can set out to laugh and not be afraid to cry . We can depend on our partner 's feelings for us . Sex in a healthy relationship is another way to demonstrate deep caring . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience . The new liquid lubricants-like Astroglide and KY Liquid-or Replense suppositories are wonderful for vaginal dryness . Using a vibrator can compensate for reduced sensation . Dr. Randall Schapiro suggests massage with a bag of frozen peas for numbness in the genital area . * We can also talk about sex with our health-care team-to get the best out of medications for fatigue or spasticity . So , where are you when the lights go out ? As your partner approaches you , will your mind still cloud with dread ? The answer can be a resounding no . You are as deserving as any woman on the planet to a full expression of your sexuality You may have to work a bit harder , but the work has its rewards ! Author Affiliation <p>                     @x Step One : Problem <p> High in the mountains of Cameroon , West Africa , there was a small lake surrounded by green , treeless cliffs  --  Lake Nyos . No river emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and springs from below , leaving the surface utterly still  --  a blue jewel set in a mountaintop , penetrated by slanted bars of light . Water trickled gently from it into a valley that held three small villages of cattle herders . <p> Summer was usually the rainy season , but the August of 1986 had been dry . Then , on the evening of the twenty-first , a warm , pelting rain began to fall . Children came outside to run through the grass and slide in the mud , while cows lumbered into the shelter of the great , waxy-leafed trees . <p> The cattle here were of an African variety that Idahoans would never have seen : giants with great wide horns and spines that hung like suspension bridges between humps at the shoulder and hip . As majestic in unblemished white as Idaho cows were humble in brown inkblots , they looked more like wild things  --  water buffalo or wildebeest  --  than anything you 'd raise and eat . Those Idahoans who saw the news reports in the following days , which showed these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , they had moved regally , their muscles rolling and twitching under their sleek coats . The Idahoans fixed their minds on the death of these cows rather than the cows ' owners . A cow lying dead with flies in its eyes was a common enough sight . <p> The rain died off at sunset . Then , in the middle of the night , a gust of wind blew through the villages and up over the mountains . This was n't a howling tempest ; it did n't have force enough to snap limbs off trees , just to flap the leaves and send down a second , lesser shower . Nobody even woke up . But the wind moved the blanket of rain water across the surface of Lake Nyos . Like a tablecloth that one pushes across a tabletop , which gathers momentum and falls of its own weight to the floor , the warm water collected in one corner , then slipped down the side , past the still strata of frigid water , to the depths where something lay sleeping . The villagers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sanctuary for evil spirits , would later say it was the Lake Witch . She awoke , swam up the opposite side of Lake Nyos , and emerged from the water with a groan and a rumble . A few villagers woke and sat up in bed , wondering , Was it a dream ? Seconds later their breath was taken from them , and they fell back onto their pillows . Their family members sleeping across the room did n't even awaken , but made a few gasping snores before they died . Outside , cows fell on their knees , surged to heave themselves back up , then rolled onto their sides . Birds dropped like black fruit from the trees . A bat swooped to catch an insect that had fallen dead , but failed , died , and tumbled through the air . Strangely , though , another bat flying at a higher altitude did n't die , but flitted away to find a fresher meal elsewhere . <p> Farther down the valley , the Lake Witch seemed to tire . She allowed the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors before they fell . She let them feel the struggle of their children gasping for air under them before taking their lives . <p> Dawn came hot and steaming . A man used a switch both to drive his five cows up the road and to swat the biting flies from his own ankles . He entered the trail of the Lake Witch where there were no more flies , but he did not notice this . The buzzing and chirping , which never stopped , had stopped , but until the man came upon that first dead cow , he could n't name the chill . <p> A similar , though much less ominous , disorientation  --  a gap between feeling the chill and naming it  --  was experienced only days later by Connie Anderson in Eula , Idaho . Temperatures had reached one hundred degrees every day for a week . At dusk one Thursday , when husbands were plugging in their Weedwhackers to charge them up for the weekend , and wives were turning on their sewing machines , and everyone was tuning their TVs to Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City ( where few Eulans had ever been but which seemed gritty and fascinating and made their own lives seem dull , yes , but clean ) , the electricity , already overtaxed by air conditioners that had been running all day , went out . <p> Connie happened to be leaving First Church of the Nazarene at that moment . She and some women from her group , the Dorcas Circle , had volunteered to change the decorations in the sanctuary . They had taken down garlands of plastic roses from the stained-glass windows , replaced them with bunches of Indian corn , and propped up sheaves of dried cattails and corn stalks in the corners . The last to leave , Connie stepped out of the church and opened her purse to look for her keys . She found them , looked up , and everything had changed . She reached for the handrail in case she was fainting . A dog 's insistent bark echoed in the distance . A car passed , and its tires on the smooth road made a sound like breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dipped in gold on the edge closest to the horizon , behind which the sun had dropped . The scarlet haze on the horizon and the faint odor of spice were due , Connie knew , to the wildfires that had been burning steadily for several days in the brush lands across the Snake River from Eula . Small clouds suspended above the haze in the west shone like nuggets . Then , before Connie could name the difference , the streetlights flickered on , and the windows of the houses glowed , and something buzzed  --  the power line that entered the church building above Connie 's head , which she never would have noticed otherwise . <p> <br> Continues ...
