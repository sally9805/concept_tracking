The experience of fighting a war was n't over yet  --  the most important lesson lay ahead . <p> " To all who see these presents , greeting : The President of The United States of America authorized by Act of Congress July 9 , 1918 , has awarded The Silver Star to First Lieutenant Hugh W. Weldon , Jr. , 05343367 , Infantry , United States Army , for Gallantry In Action while engaged in close combat with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam on 25 March 1969 . " <p> The powerful thrust of the jet engines drove me deep into my seat as the plane rose into the Georgia night . It was July 15 , 1969 , and 35 minutes was all that remained of a journey that had begun two days earlier and a world away . First Lt. Hugh Weldon , Infantry , United States Army , was coming home from Vietnam . <p> The face that stared vacantly at the disappearing Atlanta lights was different from the fun-loving youngster who had reversed this route a year earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin tone was darker . And I was more subdued  --  a hair-raising episode or two had a way of impressing on young lieutenants the merits of a low profile . Finally , baby fat had given way to a leaner body  --  restful nights for junior infantry officers were few , and the food , well , let 's just say that nobody goes to war for the cuisine . <p> My tour had changed me . And although it was unknown to me at that precise moment , the experience was n't over yet . The most important lesson was ahead . <p> This trip had been the focus of my life for the past year ; the anticipation started from day one . As with every soldier m every war , there was but : one overpowering desire : to go home . To those of us in Vietnam , " home " took on an almost magical air . We spoke of it in reverent terms and built it : up to mythical proportions . We called it " The World . " <p> Although each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally agreed on the following World is a special place where people sleep in real beds ; take hot showers every day ; and do not have to keep their steel helmet , flak vest , and M-16 rifle within lunging distance . The lazy late breakfasts feature hot , fresh-brewed coffee ; and the chocolate desserts are so creamy you need a spoon . In The World , buddies have nothing better to do than pack sandwiches and go on daylong hunting trips together , And last , The World is a distant land where pretty girls smell nice and wear dresses . <p> Except for specific military duties , everything centered around going home . For one year we dreamed , discussed , and planned on getting back to The World . If you wanted to start a conversation with anybody , all you had to do was ask , " Hey , what are you gon na do when you get back to The World ? " And then get comfortable . <p> If you 've never come home from a war , picture it like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rich . Of course , all along you knew there was not : much chance of its actually happening , but it was fun to while away the hours , daydreaming about how you 'd spend the money . Then out of nowhere , a huge inheritance . All of ' a sudden , your dreams come true . But after concentrating on the dream so long , it 's tough to separate the dream from the reality . In a word , it 's disorienting . That s what coming home from a war is like . <p> There had already been one culture shock . That morning while I was passing through San Francisco International Airport , it ! " struck me that nobody had a gun . The entire airport was defenseless . It would be a piece of cake for a few Viet Cong to slip up to the airport doors , blow them  --  scratch that , the blasted things would open automatically  --  and enter unopposed . <p> I nervously sat there awaiting my flight , eyes glued to the door , and worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before I could get out of there . And the odd thing was that I knew I was being silly . But my eyes never left the door . Yeah , you could call me disoriented . Caught between worlds . <p> The twinkling town of Augusta , Georgia , silently passed beneath us as we crossed from Georgia into South Carolina . Then the pilot reduced power for landing . The trip so far-Bien Hoa to Travis Air Base near Oakland to Atlanta  --  had taken 38 hours . It had been an emotional roller coaster . And it was n't over yet . <p> It was 10:30 p.m. when the plane 's tires squealed touchdown in Columbia . Sometime during the long glide in , I had started crying softly into my handkerchief . Here was this infantry officer , his chest covered with combat and service award ribbons , crying . Fortunately , the plane was almost deserted . Nobody was watching . <p> Deep breathing helped , and as we pulled to a stop I regained control . After the rolling stairway was in position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I had not moved . Not a twitch . <p> Coming home is not something infantry lieutenants take lightly . While outwardly we were all like John Wayne , in quiet moments we acknowledged the awful truth : infantry lieutenants had the highest mortality rate of any army group . For example , in my first unit there were three lieutenants . I alone came home . I was an extraordinarily lucky person . <p> Out came the handkerchief again . I knew I could n't stay on this plane forever . Slowly , I made it to the front of the plane  --  still out of sight of the terminal  --  and peered out into the brightly lit runway area . <p> There appeared to be about a dozen steps to the ground and then 50 yards to the terminal . And there , behind the security barricades , stood a small quiet group of people . They were staring at this airplane . <p> I had to do something . With a deep breath , I stood straight , tugged at my wrinkled khaki shirt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top step of the stairway . The five people behind the barricades went nuts . <p> Momentarily I froze , uncertain about what to do next . Then , deliberately , I groped my way down the stairs . One hand held the briefcase containing my army separation papers , and the other  --  white knuckles showing  --  was attached to the railing . <p> As the distance narrowed , I began to recognize faces . There was Mom her eyes scanning me as she went through the age old Mother 's Checklist : two eyes , two arms , two legs , no limp , no scars or wounds , moving under his own power .... <p> Dad stood beside her , his arm around her waist . From experience in World War II , he knew there was often more to wartime homecomings than met the eye . His expression said , " He looks fine , but I wonder ... ' ? " As usual , he was close to the mark . <p> My two rotten little brothers ? were the most animated . They knew high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scene for all it was worth . But somehow they seemed less rotten and certainly less little . <p> Next to them was the stuff of every soldier 's dreams . She was wearing a red plaid skirt and waving Wildly . I was tired , but I was n't dead  --  now that was something . <p> Halfway between the plane and the terminal , I slowed to a stop , unable to continue . All this was just too much . <p> Out of the worst comes the best . Our most cherished values are forged in the fires of troubled times . Like the seriously ill man who comes to appreciate everyday things , the prisoner who comes to prize freedom , and the soldier under fire who comes to know the calming power of prayer , I was about to make a terrible experience worthwhile . <p> It hit me . We had all been wrong . Every trooper who had viewed The World as some thing or some place Was wrong . It never was hot showers , or soft beds . And it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We had missed point . <p> The World was the people  --  our loved ones  --  who wrote us , prayed for us , and waited for us . They were what was good . They were what was important . And my world was standing behind the barricade 25 yards away . <p> With that understanding came the end to a long year . I was with the people I cared for and , once again , everything was as it should be . I had made it . My war was finally over . <p> I started forward again , slowly , one foot in front of the other . Then a little faster . And faster . And faster .... <p> Epilogue  --  July 15 , 1990 <p> I 'm pleased to tell you that in the years which followed , I found The World to be to my liking and well-worth the price we paid . <p> To this day I love to sleep in a soft bed , appreciate hot showers , and seldom pass on the desserts . More important , our family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole gang gathers on all the traditional days . And after 20 years of marriage , that pretty girl in the red plaid skirt is still the brightest light in every room . <p> So my luck continues ; I remain the most fortunate of men . But I never go hunting anymore . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> by H. W. Weldon , Jr . <p>
