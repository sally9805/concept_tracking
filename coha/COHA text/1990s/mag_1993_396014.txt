In the spring of 1990 I packed up as much of my life in London as would fit into four tea chests and flew to Seattle to set up house . It was a selfish and irregular move . I had " met someone " and liked what I 'd seen of the Pacific Northwest during a two-month stay there in the autumn of 1989 : the aquarium lighting , the sawtooth alps forested with black firs , the compact cities encrusted in Romanesque stucco . Most of all , I liked the place 's wateriness . At forty-seven I felt cracked and dry . My new home territory was as rainy as Ireland , puddled with lakes and veined with big rivers . Seattle was built out on pilings over the sea , and at high tide the whole city seemed to come afloat like a ship lifting free from a mud berth and swaying in its chains . We took a house on the wrong side of Queen Anne , the innermost of Seattle 's hilltop suburbs . The tall wooden house , built like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar , had been put up in 1906 , in the wake of the Yukon gold rush , when the hill was logged . It had warped and settled through a string of minor earthquakes : the floors sloped , doors hung askew in their frames . In the silence of the night , the house groaned and whiffled like a sleeping dog . Barely a mile from the new banking and insurance skyscrapers of downtown , the house felt hidden away in the woods . Shaggy conifers , survivors of the original forest , darkened the views from every window . The study looked down over the Ship Canal , where trawlers stalked through an avenue of poplars on their way to the Alaskan fishing grounds , eight hundred miles to the north . From the deck on the top floor , one could see out over the pale suburbs , like shell middens , to the serrated line of the Cascade mountains , still snowcapped in May . For someone fresh off the plane from London , it was a big prospect to take in , and a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fine to be a tourist in this landscape , when I had been enjoyably awed by its far-western heights and distances ; but now that I 'd signed up as a permanent resident , the view from the window seemed only to reflect my own displacement here . Even the very near-at-hand was strange . I kept Peterson 's Western Birds and the Audubon Society 's Western Forests by the typewriter . I made lists , and pinned them to the wall . Redwood , cedar , cypress , dogwood , laurel , madrona , maple , I wrote , trying to distinguish individual personalities in the jumble of damp and muddy greens framed by the window . I took the tree book down to the garden and matched the real-life barks with their pictures ; the peeling , fish-scale skin of the lodge-pole pine , the frayed hemp rope of the coast redwood . It took a month , at least , to be able to see the black-crested Steller 's jay in the madrona with something like the comfortable indifference with which I 'd used to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a good deal longer to adjust to the way the rufous hummingbird , like a tiny thrashing autogiro , redisposed itself in space , zapping from point to point too fast for the eye to follow . Glancing up from the typewriter , stuck for a phrase , I 'd sight a bald eagle , circling on a thermal over the Ship Canal on huge stiff ragged wings , and lose the logic of the sentence to another bout of ornithology . The German word for " uncanny , " as in Freud 's famous essay on the Uncanny , is unheimlich  --  unhomely . The tourist thrives on the uncanny , moving happily through a phenomenal world of effects without causes . This world , in which he has no experience and no memory , is presented to him as a supernatural domain : the language of travel advertising hawks the uncanny as part of the deal . Experience the magic of Bali ! the wonders of Hawaii ! the enchantment of Bavaria ! But for the newly arrived immigrant , this magic stuff is like a curse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , in an uncanny realm where the familiar house sparrows have all fled , to be replaced by hummingbirds and eagles . The immigrant needs to grow a memory , and grow it fast . Somehow or other , he must learn to convert the uncanny into the homely , in order to find a stable footing in his new land . The shock of the stupendous unhomelikeness of this landscape drove my countryman George Vancouver into a pit of what now appears to have been clinical depression . Between May and June of 1792 , as he probed the inlets of Washington and British Columbia , he went from dizzy elation to sullen melancholy  --  and wrote his changing moods into the permanent nomenclature of the region . To begin with , he was high on his discoveries : this was " the most lovely country that can be imagined . " He saw Devonshire ; imagined orderly villages with churches and manors laid out between the wooded hills . At this stage of the voyage , the names he gave to the headlands , bays , and fjords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point . May turned into June . As Vancouver sailed north , the mountains grew steeper , the inlets narrower , the woods more impenetrable . His lieutenant , Peter Puget , who kept a parallel journal , was increasingly excited by the romantic sublimity of what he saw : a few years younger than Vancouver , he was much more in tune with the rising generation 's taste for wild nature . For Puget , the unfolding landscape was " majestic " and full of " grandeur " ; for Vancouver , it was increasingly " dreary , " " unpleasant , " " desolate , " " gloomy , " " dismal , " and " awful "  --  the words pepper his descriptions , often being used twice in the same sentence . Five minutes north of the fiftieth parallel , Vancouver brought his ship to a " dreary and unpleasant anchorage " : " Our residence here was truly forlorn ; an awful silence pervaded the gloomy forests , whilst animated nature seemed to have deserted the neighbouring country ... " He called the place Desolation Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn of 1805 , Lewis and Clark reached the Columbia River valley from the continental interior , after climbing to the headwaters of the Missouri and crossing the Rocky Mountains in what is now Montana . Clark , with his botched spellings and childish exclamation marks , was a resoundingly lively presence on the page . He was an original vernacular narrator as he confided his discomforts , " Dear Diary " - style , to his journal . " O ! how horriable is the day  --  " he wrote , when the tidal Columbia cut up rough in a westerly gale and waves drenched the explorers ' camp . " We are all wet and disagreeable . " Like every newcomer to the Northwest , Clark was incredulous at the monotonous fall rains that soaked the country west of the Cascades . Day after day it rained , hour after hour  --  with the fine-sifted thoroughness and regularity of a gigantic lawn sprinkler . " This morning Cloudy and drisley . " " Rained all the last night we are all wet . " " Rain as usial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " " A hard rain all the last night we again get wet . " " Rained very hard . " The swollen river carried with it the trunks of uprooted trees , " maney of them nearly 200 feet long " ; spinning on the current , they threatened to capsize the expedition 's canoes . " Those monsterous trees  --  " wrote Clark , summoning the vocabulary of the uncanny to convey the gross abundance of this landscape . November 1992 and the snow level , said Harry Wappler , our TV weatherman , was down to 3,500 feet and dropping fast . In a week the mountain passes would be tricky and the back roads closed for the winter . I dug out of storage my never-used box of tire chains and set off on a wide swing around the neighborhood . It was high time to make the trip ; though I had been living in Seattle for more than two years , I was still confused as to its whereabouts . I knew the city better than its cabdrivers ( a very modest boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Seattle fitted into the larger story . A long drive , on empty western roads where it 's still possible to think with one 's foot down , would , with luck , thread the oddly assorted bits of the Pacific Northwest onto one string and set them in narrative order . The afternoon rush hour had started by the time I got away , and on Interstate 90 heading east , the cars were locked bumper-to-bumper on the floating bridge over Lake Washington . The sky was lightless , and the windshield wipers scraped on the glass in the fall moisture , typical of these parts , that was something more than mist and less than rain . The traffic jam was typical of these parts , too : a ceremonious procession , like a funeral , of W ( Is with ski racks on their tops and I 'D RATHER BE SAILING stickers on their rear ends . A lot of higher education was stuck on the bridge that afternoon . The names of the universities from which the drivers had graduated were posted in their back windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Columbia , Missouri , Michigan . My own car , a low-slung , thirsty , black Dodge Daytona with a working ashtray , marked me out as a Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms  --  too old , dirty , and wasteful to pass as a member of Seattle 's uniquely refined middle class . Stuffed into the book bag beside the work of the northwestern writers whom I had brought along for the ride ( Richard Hugo , Ursula K. Le Guin , Raymond Carver , Katherine Dunn , William Stafford , Norman Maclean , James Welch , James Crumley ) was a bottle of Teacher 's , two-thirds full , which would have been okay by the northwestern writers but thought a very low touch by these northwestern drivers . In Seattle , a double shot of non-decaffeinated espresso was thought to be pushing the boat out farther than was wise . In shifts and starts , we lurched into Eastside Seattle , Houyhnhnm country , where the VWs began to peel off to the Bellevue exits . Bellevue and its satellites were not suburbs so much as  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its own economy , sociology , and architecture . Things made on the Eastside were odorless , labor-intensive , and credit-card thin , like computer software and aerospace-related electronics gear . They were assembled in low , tree-shaded factories , whose grounds were known as " campuses "  --  for in Bellevue all work was graduate work , and the jargon of college leaked naturally into the workplace . Seen from an elevated-freeway distance , Bellevue looked like one of its own products : a giant circuit board of color-coded diodes and resistors , connected by a mazy grid of filaments . During the presidential campaign , Bill Clinton had jetted around the country , calling for the advent of the " high-growth , high-wage , smart-work society "  --  a fair description of Bellevue , with its lightly rooted , highly trained workforce , its safe streets , its scented malls sprayed with composerless light orchestral music , its air of bland good conscience . Bellevue was the new and hopeful face of American capitalism , and it had a strongly Japanese cast to its features . The one- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business management that was closer to the industrial collectives of Tokyo than to the moribund hierarchies of Detroit and the American Rust Belt . The place looked like somebody 's utopia , more a model city than an actual one , and it was inhabited by the kinds of people whom architects like to place as strolling figures in the foregrounds of watercolor sketches of their projects . Wherever the eye wandered in Bellevue , it lit on another 31-3/4-year-old , with a master 's if not a doctorate , dressed for work in hiking shoes and chunky sweater . Thousands of these diagrammatic people were housed along I-90 in white-painted , shingled faux-New England condo blocks called " villages . " Lakefront Village ... Redwood Village ... Olde Towne Village ... communities in which the villagers met in the evenings at neighboring Exercycles in the village health club or at a pre-breakfast tee-off on the village driving range . Eastside Seattle was a new kind of American city , though it had a lot in common with the long-established retirement paradises of Florida and southern California . People in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had done only toward the ends of their lives ) for the sake of the climate and the natural amenities of a place rather than just for the jobs offered there . They were coming to Seattle in much the same way as people had gone to Venice , California , and to Miami Beach ; the difference was that they were coming at the beginnings of their careers . So they arrived , as kayakers , hikers , balloonists , bird-watchers , skiers , and mountain bikers who also happened to have degrees in math and marketing and computer science . Their Pacific Northwest was really a civic park , roughly the same size as France , equipped with golf courses , hiking trails , rock-climbing routes , boat-launch ramps , ski lifts , campgrounds , and scenic overlooks . This great migration of open-air hobbyists ( which dated from about 1980  --  the early Reagan years ) had won Seattle a curious niche in urban history , as the first big city to which people had fled in order to be closer to nature . Sixteen miles out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its tracks by the foothills of the Cascades . Beyond Issaquah the black cliffs of the forest began , and the social character of the road abruptly changed , as the last of the VWs melted into the last of the white condo blocks . Up till now I 'd been in the fast lane ; no longer . Mud-slathered pickups with jumbo tires charged past the Dodge wearing angry slogans on their tailgates : JOBS BEFORE OWLS . SUPPORT THE TIMBER INDUSTRY . SAVE A LOGGER-SHOOT AN OWL . Behind the glass of a cab window , a Zippo lighter flashed in the gloaming . Small charcoal-colored clouds were snagged in the firs . We were climbing steadily now , the road wet , the light failing fast . Each bend in the road opened on another wall of Douglas fir , the trees as dense and regularly spaced as the bristles on a broom . This was n't true forest ; it was a " tree farm "  --  a second- or third-growth plantation , now ready for " harvesting . " The terms were those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , I still found myself putting quotation marks around them in my head . To me , farm and harvest meant a two-acre wheat field in Essex , with rabbits scarpering from between the cornstalks , and the words refused to stick when I tried to attach them to a mountain range with 150-foot trees , where bears and cougars ran out in place of rabbits and twin-rotor helicopters served as baling machines . Though my perspective was altering : each time I thought of the half-timbered farmhouses of the Dengie Marshes , their checkerboard crops neatly hedged and ditched , they looked less like farms and more like cottage gardens . The road veered left around a dripping wall of rock and disclosed a harvest . Harvest ? It was like a dynamited factory chimney or a disused housing project blown to smithereens . It was magnificent . A rectangle of forest a mile square had been shaved from the face of the mountain : the straight lines of the clear-cut were contemptuous of the natural bulges and fissures of the landscape ; they sliced through gully and ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruler and an X-acto knife . Every tree was gone . In close-up , where the bottom edge of the clear-cut grazed the next hairpin turn , one saw the mess of it : the blackened stumps and upended root systems , the yawning mud craters , their outlines softening now with a healing overgrowth of blackberry and salal , with , here and there , the green spike of a sapling fir breaking through . It looked like photos of the Flanders battlefields in 1918 ; a whole world of burnings , explosions , amputations , random excavations . It wanted only the tin hats of the dead to be hung on the blasted stumps . Then it was gone , this enormous combat zone between man and nature , borne away by the fast-swerving road . Not long ago I saw the word " clear-cutting " in a list of wanton evils that culminated in " genocide " : utter abhorrence is the politically correct response to the miles of razored forest . Yet it was only yesterday afternoon that the logger was the greatest of all American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization over the unruly wilderness . Even now , American children are being raised on the stories of the craggy giant Paul Bunyan , with his lopsided lantern-jawed grin , whose blue ox , Babe , measured forty-two ax handles and one Star tobacco tin from eye to eye . Bunyan is the embodiment of unbridled masculine power . In Wisconsin one December he felled " 100 million feet of lumber " to find a suitably tall Christmas tree ; he logged Minnesota with a saw half a mile in length . The clear-cut was a true-life Paul Bunyan story  --  exuberant , exaggerated , so far out of fashion that it was criminal . It stood for an American way of thinking and feeling about nature that was not easily going to be wiped out by a generation 's worth of environmentalist education . For more than four hundred years of white settlement , this was what you did with the wild  --  tamed it with bold rectangles and straight lines . There was a stirring kind of American poetry in the rifle-shot road ; the ambitiously projected grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the swamp ; the single-file march of power pylons over a mountain ; the rigid outline of the clear-cut . This was order , reason , discipline imposed on an adversarial and unregenerate nature . By the last quarter of the twentieth century , Americans had come within sight of the end of wild nature  --  but the habit of mind , bred in Protestant theology , was as embedded in the national character as an instinct . If I were a logger , I thought , I 'd brim with pride at what I had done to that mountain , and I would hate with a passion the whining townies who were trying to demonize my kind . Save a logger , shoot an owl ! The road got darker and darker as it climbed toward the blue snowfields on the peaks . The car 's automatic transmission kept on flubbing its gear changes as the gradient steepened . National Public Radio , lost since Issaquah , returned , on the top of Snoqualmie Pass , with the news that John Major had carried the motion on the Maastricht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . In England , I thought with a sudden unexpected twinge of homesickness , it was Bonfire Night . Bowling downhill , east of the summit , I ran out of the rain into a cold dry night with a waxing lemony quarter-moon overhead . The trees began to shrink in height and there were lightsome spaces between them , for the climate of eastern Washington , in the lee of the Cascades , is arid . At one end of the state there 's a rain forest , at the other a desert , and the Cascade Ridge splits the state in two , giving geographical reality to Washington 's schizoid personality , its fierce divisions between wet liberals and dry conservatives . Much of Washington State politics consisted of the angry exchange of ballot initiatives between the two sides of the mountains . From the urban corridor of western Washington , one of the great liberal enclaves of the nation , came measures to protect gay rights , the right to choose , and the right of the terminally ill to die . The east responded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion , to rid the syllabus of blasphemous and immoral teaching materials , and to promote creationist lecturers in high schools . The west of the state tried to apply a brake to the ethical authoritarianism of the east , while the east saw it as its mission to curb the godless and licentious tendencies of Seattle and its fellow-traveling cities . Politicians who tried to represent the interests of the whole state had to fudge . The House Speaker , Tom Foley , was a Democrat who stood for an eastern Washington congressional district ( his power base lay in the city of Spokane , but he needed a proportion of the farm vote ) . On most issues he was thought of as a generally liberal figure , but on gun control he was a live-free-or-die National Rifle Association man . Washington had a death penalty , and used it  --  but there was an odd twist to the law in the state . Sentenced to die , you were accorded the right to choose the means of your execution . Death by hanging or by lethal injection ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the range , I pulled off the highway and stopped for a drink . The small town 's too-wide main street was empty of people . The air was icy . But there was a good bar : in the rancid fog of cigarette smoke , a line of broad-brimmed hats , broad buttocks , and red plaid jackets . Conversation , which had been brisk when I walked in , stopped dead when I hoisted myself onto the only vacant stool . " Hi . Mind if I  --  ? " I got a fishy stare for an answer . Then a man resumed the interrupted sentence he 'd been speaking to his neighbor : " ... like I was saying , they got some over in Wenatchee ... " I was caught in the crossfire of the war between the country and the city . Too late in the season to be a hiker , too early to be a skier , I was a likely member of that most despicable of all urban species , the bird-watchers . It was n't so much that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bankrupted log-hauling companies , and the rest of the miseries of the timber industry . What rankled most deeply in the depressed towns of the Cascades was the righteous triumphalism of the owlers as they rejoiced in the industry 's decline . That the owlers came ( or so the timber interests surmised ) from the environs of Bellevue , which appeared to grow fatter , richer , and smugger by the day , was the final affront . Sipping without pleasure at my beer , I saw in the bar mirror the man who was sitting on my stool  --  a " fern kisser , " a " prairie fairy , " a " watermelon " ( green on the outside , red on the inside ) . A sumbitch preservationist . The Dodge parked on the street was marginally in my favor , but Peterson 's Western Birds , parked on the passenger seat , was not . Next morning a kindly fog filled the valley . It shrouded the outline of the Super 8 motel , built and furnished like a low-security prison , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood-and-mustard gas-station architecture around the highway . I tucked the Dodge behind a slow-moving truck with Pennsylvania plates ( I-90 is an epic ; it starts in downtown Seattle and finishes at Boston Harbor ) and followed it blindly into the gray . The last rags of fog faded into the air and suddenly one could see for miles : a huge tract of unrelieved ocher under an empty ice-blue sky . At Vantage , the road crossed the mile-wide Columbia River , yet even here there was no vegetation to speak of . The river , bigger even than my memory of the Mississippi , ran through a cutting of frost-crumbled rock . Furrowed by a wind I had n't noticed until I saw the water , the Columbia was breaking like a sea . Until that moment I had thought that someday I 'd like to ride a boat down the 1,214-mile-long river , an ambition canceled on sight . It was the most impossible-looking stretch of inland water I 'd ever seen  --  no shading trees , no riverside bars , no islands ; nothing but wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad-tempered black canal . The plateau was dead level from horizon to horizon ; the road tapered evenly to a dot in the middle distance . Half a dozen small farms went by . Although this land was parched , its soil was rich . It had been a desert until the 1950s , when the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia was tapped to bring a network of water pipes and irrigation ditches to eastern Washington , and homesteaders moved in on this unlikely , monochrome terrain . I kept on driving past the same farm : same trailer home parked on the same dusty plot ; same Chevy pickup ; same chained yellow dog ; same great tilted silver satellite dish collecting messages from the heavens . The best-kept farms announced themselves from several miles off with a lone poplar tree , four times as tall as the telephone poles that were otherwise the most commanding feature of the landscape . The plateau was dotted with these flagstaff poplars , each one a signal of someone 's long-standing residence and patient husbandry . It was a big thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunted sagebrush . A Seattle friend , who had been visiting eastern Washington since his childhood in the 1940s , told me how the tree was known on these farms as The Tree ; whenever the dishes were washed or a bath was taken , the dirty water was carried out and fed tenderly to The Tree , whose inch-by-inch growth was monitored like a child 's . On a road so straight , through a landscape so flat , distance dissolves into time and time decelerates to the speed of a watched kettle . The farms seemed to come to a standstill as the car got stuck beside the same telephone pole . Looking down to find the radio on/off button , I noticed that the speedometer needle was securely lodged between 105 and 110 . I lifted my foot from the gas pedal and watched the needle drop slowly through the numbers : at 55 , the next mailbox appeared to be slightly receding , as if the car were failing to keep up with the rotation of the earth . The Idaho-Montana state line crossed Look out Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred miles I-90 ran down the back side of the Bitterroot Range , to Missoula . It looped round crags , skirted shale falls , switched promiscuously from river course to river course in its search for the low ground . As dusk settled , the hills dissolved into clouds of swirling soot . Light spilled over the wet road from the Dodge 's headlights , making driving a tense and headachy business . The car plowed through the dazzle at a breakneck 45 . Trucks rolled past like speeding ships , leaving the Dodge floundering in their wake . I ate the unpleasant remains of a cellophane-wrapped ham sandwich , bought before the beginning of Idaho , and counted the miles down to the safe haven of Missoula . It took a long time coming . Then it was there  --  a sackful of flights scattered over a broad , flat valley bottom below the highway . I was tired and road-shocked , and it seemed that there was something not quite right about the place . As soon as the car passed under the railroad bridge that marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex industrial flavor of carbons in the air . The streetlights all wore smoggy halos and the dark brick architecture was slightly out of focus . Expecting a winter resort town  --  something along the lines of Aspen , Colorado  --  I had the powerful impression that I had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley . Berthed in a motel room , with a finger Of Teacher 's in a tooth glass , I called home . The five-hundred-mile distance between Seattle and Missoula felt as long as if we were talking across a continent . We were in different time zones . The temperature here was in the twenties ; on Queen Anne Hill it was in the fifties and there was still a tomato-red sunset over Puget Sound . I was saying " the mountains ! " " the desert ! " " the Christians ! " like any traveler in a foreign land , and it was disconcerting to discover that my wife , lean , seemed to think that I was just around the corner . " If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell 's ? " Pick up a pint of milk at the shop on your way home , will you ? Next morning the air was clear and thin ; in cold sunshine , the buildings of Missoula seemed to have drifted apart during the night . The huge spaces of the landscape had infected the architecture of the town : courthouse , bank , department store were like lonely mountain peaks , with low-lying plains between them , while the snow-dusted sides of real mountains rose almost sheer above Missoula , boxing it in around the Clark Fork River . The effect was unsettling : the streets were too open for comfort , the town too closed-in , inducing mild claustrophobia and agoraphobia at the same time . The river that ran through it was quick and trouty . It spilled noisily over boulders and the trunks of fallen trees , baffling the sound of the traffic in the streets . The walkway along the riverbank was busy with promenading hoboes . Men with bedrolls and sun-bleached beards strolled in ones and twos , reclined full-length on public benches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching for the pewtery underwater wink of a feeding fish . The gravel shore was littered with the remains of small neat driftwood fires . The hoboes rode in on the boxcars of the Northern Pacific Railroad , drawn to Missoula by its reputation as a kindly town . A meal , a shower , a bed for the night could be had at the Poverello Center on Ryman . Word had gone around that transients could find work here . Other Montana towns , like Butte and Helena , were said to be sewn up tight by the labor unions , but Missoula was still " open , " and so the hopefuls kept showing up , despite the fact that homelessness and unemployment were now endemic in Missoula . Winter was coming , and I would n't like to be caught with a backpack and a bedroll in a place where the January temperature was likely to sink to twenty below or worse . Yet famously kindly towns are few and far between , and the presence of these shambling , amiable men said a lot for Missoula as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a sporting chance of redeeming them . It had all the useful amenities that go with low wages and hard times : cafs with coffee for twenty-five cents ( refills free ) ; thrift shops on every comer selling J. C. Penney business suits at $7.50 a throw ; a dozen pawnshops , stacked to their ceilings with accordions , farm tools , fob watches , and stereophonic junk . Standing in front of one of these dusty treasure houses , eyeing an elderly Bausch &; Lomb microscope and trying not to give in to the impulse to rescue it , I was joined at the window by a hobo . He looked like a man with nothing to pawn and no money to buy . Maybe he was making a sentimental visit to one of his own old possessions . Together we stared wordlessly into the window until the silence seemed rude . I said lamely , " Whole lot of pawnshops in this town ... " " Yup , " he said . " You want to buy an old guitar or a gun , Missoula 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the university , a dirt road led up a smooth and snowy hillside that had once formed the bank of the great emptied lake . A red-tailed hawk ( the bird book was back in play ) was crouched on top of a telephone pole , looking down into Missoula , waiting for a rat to break cover on the lake floor . I opened the car door gently , but the hawk took fright . It scrambled untidily off its perch and sailed away on braced-flat chestnut wings . Minutes later it was still in sight , quartering the air over the town in patient circles , ready to drop like a thunderbolt out of the sky on the next thing that moved . From up here , Missoula looked more like an oversize trailer park than a city with a few thousand little pastel-colored houses loosely strewn across the valley . A minor tremor in the local geology  --  a slight resettling of the crust , a rise of a few feet in the level of the river  --  would be enough to wipe Missoula clean off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mountains ' backs in a succession of shelving snowfields and walls of black rock  --  and these enormous fractures and upheavals looked dangerously raw , as if there might be more of them later today or early tomorrow morning . I thought : If I lived in Missoula , I 'd lie awake at night listening to the earth creak . The valley trended westward . After a couple of miles or so , the squat buildings of Missoula petered out , and then there was just the intermittent glint of the river , like a twist of wire , running into haze and distance . It was a long , long way down there to Seattle . Yet Seattle was Missoula 's big city . If you needed the London papers ( two days old ) or a bone-marrow transplant , if you wanted to see a major-league baseball game or eat dinner in a French restaurant , you had to make the journey to Seattle . Its nearest rival was Minneapolis , a thousand miles back over the Rockies and in another regional world . People went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the drive . They went for the Seahawks , the Mariners , the Sonics ; for the Seattle Symphony , the Rep , the Pacific Northwest Ballet . Every big city is sustained by its hinterland : it offers services that are too specialized and expensive for even a metropolitan population to support on its own . Seattle had a gigantic hinterland for such a small big city . It was the provincial capital of places like Missoula , as of all the charmless one-gas-station towns and lonely farms halfway up mountainsides that lay in between ; and , in their turn , the places like Missoula strongly colored Seattle with their own expectations of what a big city ought to be . Squinting into the haze at the far end of the valley , one could almost see Seattle  --  at least , one could sense the faint but definite magnetic tug of the city . And from this distance I got the point of Seattle 's habit of grandiloquent self-advertisement , its preoccupation ( which I had taken to be merely neurotic ) with structures that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kind " west of the Mississippi , " in the cant phrase . Its romance with the monumental had begun with the timber-baron Roman Empire style of the downtown architecture ; with the now-dainty office building that had once been the tallest building w. of the M. ; with the absurdly haughty expressions of the terra-cotta walruses that condescended from the facade of the Arctic Club . It was a city of bizarre novelties and grandiose follies . Its sports stadium , the King-dome , was famous for defying the laws of physics and the canons of good taste . Its most arresting landmark , put up for the 1962 World 's Fair , was the Space Needle  --  a stout radio mast whimsically surmounted by an intergalactic flying saucer , drawn from a 1950s sci-fi comic . Living with the Space Needle on the other side of Queen Anne Hill was rather like having to put up with a black-velvet portrait of Jesus on one 's living-room wall ; but here on this hillside , five hundred miles off , I thought I understood what the Space Needle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle 's capital status across the hinterland  --  and for the message to reach out to Missoula , the signal had to be inordinately strong . A windey dark raney disagreeable morning . " The wind and rain lashed at the fast-food pagodas and bunting-hung car dealerships of suburban Missoula and flung around the overhead stoplights on their wires . With a full tank , a pint of gas-station coffee , and a Merle Haggard tape to ward off the FM evangelists , I drove out of town on U.S. 93 . The swish and slap of the windshield wipers kept good time with the banjos as Haggard and his combo sang lachrymose patriotic songs in exaggerated stereo . Both weather and music seemed right for a day on which I meant to follow the route taken by Lewis and Clark on their journey from the Continental Divide to the Columbia River in the fall of 1805 . The Lewis and Clark expedition was the crowning detail of Jefferson 's grand design for westward expansion . Though Jefferson himself never got much farther west than Staunton , Virginia , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which I now lived . He wrote the original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1785  --  the document that was responsible for the checkerboard rectangularity of the western states . Jefferson drew the grid . It was a construction typical of Jefferson 's rationalist , Enlightenment-philosophe habits of thought . No one yet knew how the land lay beyond the Mississippi . Jefferson believed that North America was probably made up of two matching halves , like a spatchcocked hen split open around the breastbone of the Mississippi basin . So there should be a range of mountains in the western territories much like the Alleghenies in the East  --  up to about five thousand feet high , with a narrow watershed , a short portage , between the rivers that ran into the Gulf of Mexico and those that ran into the Pacific . This was Jefferson 's imagined West , but his grid could cope with any topographical eventuality since it was grounded in a magnificent disregard for empirical geography . It started at an arbitrary point on the north bank of the Ohio River on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . From here , Jefferson projected a north-south meridian and a westward-running baseline as the master axes of the grid . He then spread over the undiscovered country a ghostly reticule of six-mile squares named " townships . " They stretched away across an infinity of western space , imposing a tight social order on what had been ( until the passage of the ordinance through Congress on May 20 , 1785 ) a speculative void . Every township was subdivided into thirty-six " sections " or " lots , " each a mile square , or 640 acres , and the lots were numbered from No. 1 in the southeast comer of the township to No. 36 in the northwest . Lot No. 16 ( the northeasterly of the four central squares ) was reserved for the building of a school or college , and Lot Nos. 8 , 11 , 26 , and 29 were set aside for agencies of the U.S. government . The remaining lots were to be sold by auction at not less than $1 an acre in hard-money currency , and the 640-acre section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Even on the frontier , 640 acres was a big parcel , and few settlers could raise the $640 minimum to buy a lot . To Jefferson , who farmed 10,000 acres in Virginia , both the size and price of the lots must have seemed paltry . America was destined to be socially as well as geographically symmetrical : beyond the mirror-Alleghenies , Jefferson could see a mirror-Virginia populated by gentlemen farmers of means like himself . By 1800 , when Jefferson was elected president , the Rectangular Survey was moving steadily over the ground , with townships and lots staked out as far west as the Ohio-Indiana line and south into the Mississippi territory The Far West was now a habitable idea . What it lacked was contour lines , weather , soil , flora , mineral deposits , birds , animals , and Indian nations . In June 1803 , Jefferson commissioned Lewis and Clark to furnish the West with credible detail as they sounded out the best route from St. Louis to the Columbia River . Jefferson was the West 's idealist architect ; Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so horribly unlike the Alleghenies that the travelers could hardly believe their eyes at the loom of the distant mountains over the Missouri valley . There was no narrow watershed , no short portage . Lewis and Clark had boils , dysentery , septic cuts , skin eruptions , and sore feet . Men on the expedition suffered from syphilis and doses of clap . They dragged their tons of gear up the headwaters of the Missouri and over the Continental Divide at Lemhi Pass . On September 9 , 1805 , they camped at a place they named Traveler 's Rest , ten miles south of Missoula . The name Traveler 's Rest , ten miles south was Lolo now , with a conspicuous gas station for the truckers on U.S. 93 . When I looked in , the truckers were working intently on a line of Las Vegas-style slot machines , and there was a counter display of a dozen rival brands of stay-awake pill . I threw out the colored Missoula water with which I 'd started and replaced it with a pint of black and bitter truckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , the Lewis and Clark route , branched off from the highway-a narrow blacktop on a straight  --  arrow course through a bedraggled landscape of swan-off stumps and sapling firs . Mine was the only car in sight . In ten miles I met one logging truck and , thoughts elsewhere , was startled by the disapproving myopic glare of its headlights in the rain . The road began to wind and climb on its way up to Lolo Pass through the Bitterroots. " 4 miles assend a Steep ruged mountain passing over high Stoney knobs maney parts bare of timber the Indians having burnt it down . " None of the early white visitors to the Northwest were struck by the Indians ' special reverence for their environment ; on the contrary , they were impressed by the amount of damage that the Indians , despite their limited numbers , had managed to inflict on it . On Puget Sound , George Vancouver watched " eighty or one hundred men , women and children ... busily engaged like swine , rooting up this beautiful verdant meadow in quest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mid-nineteenth-century settler on the Olympic Peninsula , wrote that coastal navigation in late summer and early fall was made extremely difficult by the pall of smoke that lay over the water from the Columbia to Nootka Sound , caused by Indian forest fires that had run out of control . Driving through the slash-and-burn operations of the timber industry , I found myself clinging to the fact that even in 1805 this was not virgin forest . When William Clark rounded this bend in the trail , he saw opening ahead an acrid wasteland of black stumps and sodden ash . My view exactly . " Emince Difficult Knobs Stones much falling timber and emencely Steep ... Several horses Sliped and roled down Steep hills which hurt them very much ... " The crossing of Lolo Pass was even tougher than the crossing of the Continental Divide . The climate was much colder then than now : in mid-September the snow was already deep here . " We are continually covered with Snow , I have been as wet and as cold in every part as I ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfull my feet would freeze in the thin mockersons which I wore ... " Beyond the summit , I pulled into a broad paved overlook , a Lewis and Clark rest area with a brown metal historic marker . Though the road was empty and hardly wider than a lane , it was punctuated with these huge rest areas , each big enough , in summer , to take a couple of tour buses and a dozen cars at a time  --  a measure of Lewis and Clark 's heroic status in the highly selective pantheon of American popular culture . Of course their journey was important  --  it made the West real ; but there was more to it than that . No other figures in American history were so endearing . Partly it was their language , which jumped off the page with its undated plain-spokenness . You could imagine bumping into Lewis and Clark at a bar , and getting on with them  --  whereas George Vancouver , say , would strike you as a very weird old windbag with an accent . Most of all , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily within reach . Lewis and Clark were America 's foremost male couple . Before Queequeg &; Ishmael , before Huck Jim , there were Lewis &; Clark . Their joint command was an extraordinary success . There seems never to have been a cross word between them . When one fell ill , the other solicitously nursed him back to health . Sometimes Lewis fussed over Clark ( " Capt . Clark is ... still very languid and complains of a general soarness in all his limbs . I prevailed on him to take the barks which he has done and eate tolerably freely of our good venison " ) ; sometimes Clark fussed over Lewis ( " Capt . Lewis out all night , we arrived at his Camp to brackfast , he was without a blanket " ) . Each was protective of the other 's weakness . Lewis , who 'd served as Jefferson 's aide , was the brainy one , Clark the better woodsman . Clark , an enthusiastic cartographer , could draw a beautiful map , but when it came to writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the grammar of the simplest sentence had a habit of raveling itself up on him in a bird's-nest tangle . So he got help from Lewis . Where the two journals run in daily parallel , one can see exactly how they were composed . Lewis wrote his entry first , then passed the elkskin-bound notebook to Clark , who copied what was written there into his own journal . In Idaho now , the road began to tumble through the forest like the river whose course it followed , swerving away at the last moment from vertical chimneys or gray rock , eddying out and doubling back . My ears popped as the car lost height . The river grew  --  like everything else here  --  prodigiously . One minute it was a crack of light in the rocks beside the road ; the next , its white-water rapids were louder than the Dodge 's engine ; the next , it swirled darkly from deep pool to deep pool , dimpling over sunken boulders , its surface scored with lines of current , like penknife doodles in the wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered Nez Perce Indian country . The river grew broad and placid enough to float a ship on . Fir gave way to stands of ash and maple in soggy , unkempt meadows by the water 's edge . The most prominent building in many miles was a sky-blue shack , padlocked for the winter , with WILD BILLS FIREWORKS painted on it in careful four-foot-high letters , each i dotted with a circle like a halo . Standing alone in the deep sticks of Idaho , the blue shack looked like crazy hopefulness on Wild Bill 's part . The grass and thistles surrounding it were untrodden : no one had yet beaten a path to its door . All over the Northwest , Indians exploited their separate-nation status by dealing on reservations in goods and services that were prohibited to their white neighbors . Where the reservations were near big towns or abutted on major highways , there were Indian casinos and bingo halls and pungent open-air fireworks markets , each called Boom City . You could buy only the most puny rockets and Catherine wheels from the state-licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get fifty-foot strings of firecrackers and three-inch-mortar skyrockets that would climb two thousand feet before going off like something out of the Gulf War . For Lewis and Clark the West was an unexplored wilderness , and they were full of the novelty and drama of their own first footsteps in the landscape ; yet wherever they went they were moving across a grid whose lines , though wavier and more irregular , were far more substantial than those of Jefferson 's projected checkerboard . As Lewis and Clark passed from one national territory to the next , they changed guides at each frontier . Even on the roughest passages , they were led , or directed , along paths that they referred to in their journals as " roads . " " I found great difficulty in finding the road in the evening as the Snow had fallen , " wrote Clark , on his way down the budding track of U.S. 12 ; " road bad as usial . " There is a big difference between a country with poor roads and a country with no roads at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bad but they were definitely there . At Lolo Pass , the explorers crossed from Flathead to Nez Perce territory and met a band of Nez Perce men who were looking for stolen horses . Clark gave the Indians fishhooks and tied a colored ribbon in each man 's hair , " which appeared to please them very much . " Lewis gave them " a Steel a little Powder to make fire . " In pantomime , the Indians explained that they lived in a village in a valley to the west , " five sleeps " away ; a six-day hike . ( This was the original of the shanty- and trailer-town at Kooskia . ) From there , the men said , they had convenient access to the Columbia , which was safely navigable to the Pacific . Lewis blew his nose , and the Indians were excited by the sight of his handkerchief . It was , they said , almost exactly like the handkerchiefs given to some relatives of theirs by an old white man who was camping on an ocean beach near the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 480 miles as the crow flies  --  more than 600 miles by crooked trails and looping river courses  --  from the Pacific , and it takes some thinking about . Who in , say , Oxfordshire , in 1805 , would have been able to gossip knowledgeably about someone seen in Genoa or Turin ? Yet Lewis in his journal does n't seem to be overly impressed by his conversation with the Indians ; he records it without comment before going on to describe the men as being " of large stature and comely form . " Lewis and Clark had arrived in a country that was already well mapped and well traveled . Goods and news were transmitted across an immense geographical space and over a large number of heavily policed tribal boundaries . When the caravan of trinket-bearing white men came stumbling down the main road from the mountains , no one seems to have been much surprised : since 1792 , at least , the Indians had been getting increasingly used to the presence of eccentric tourists with designs on their home-lands . With the pedal on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lochsa River to the valley of the Clearwater to the valley of the Snake at a steady cruising speed of five miles a word . Slowing as it reentered the state of Washington , it climbed into the bare and rumpled hills of the Palouse , their sides as smooth as gray suede . Their baldness led one to expect nothing of the summit except sagebrush and snow , but as the Dodge crested the last hill at three thousand feet , it came out onto a steppe of rich farm country . I stopped to stretch my legs and take in the surprise of it . The sky was an empty duck-egg blue , but the soil was damp from recent rain , and the colors of the land had the unreal paint-box freshness of the last few minutes before a fiery sunset . Between an enormous undulating field of buttery corn stubble and an enormous undulating field of emerald winter wheat , there marched a herd of twenty piebald cattle in single file . It was so quiet and still that one could almost hear the cows moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steepling aluminum grain elevators did the job of churches , landmarking and subordinating the sprawling patchwork of the plateau . There were no other cars on the road , and the only tractor in sight , up to its axles in chocolate earth , had a sleepy and forgotten look . The big , lonely geography of the Northwest made it easy to succumb to Lewis and Clarkery  --  to the sensation of being the first to discover an already well-discovered land . Even here , on territory so obviously occupied and cultivated , the natives of . the place seemed to have only a skin-deep tenure of it . In England , all land looks owned . Hundreds of years of continuous possession , of wills and entailments and codicils , are visibly there in the fabric of the place , where most of what you see is the work of dead people and their builders , gardeners , plowmen , and lawyers . In Washington State , the land looks squatted on , as if tomorrow it might have quite different tenants putting it to an altogether different purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it felt all right to be a stranger here . I was happy in the Northwest not because I felt at home but because no one else seemed to be entirely at home either . When people said that they went " way back " in Washington , they meant two generations , three at most . Though they liked to affect a proprietary air toward the landscape , they had n't yet had time to really make it their own . I liked their gimcrack townships because they looked as if they 'd been built inside the reach of my own memory , and built by people whose skills as architects and carpenters were not much better than my own . Driving through Pomeroy ( " The Key to Friendly Family Living , " pop . 1,415 ) , I could recognize it as exactly the sort of town I might construct myself , if I were doing it in the evenings and on weekends and paying for it as I went along . For as long as whites had been coming here , the Northwest had tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a region where unsettledness and solitude were part of the normal fabric of things . In their turn , the migrants had written their own morose character onto the face of the country , with lonely , inward-looking houses , hedged , ditched , and electric-fenced against unwelcome advances . Set far back from the road in acres of land for land 's sake , they looked less like homes than gun emplacements . The water was agitated in a most Shocking manner boils Swell &; whorl pools , we passed with great risque . " Buffeted by a strong headwind , the car sped west along the bare , ribbed valley of the Columbia . Lewis and Clark 's river , with its Indian fishing lodges and canoe-swallowing rapids , lay many feet underwater now . Locked and dammed since the 1930s , the Columbia had been turned into a staircase of epic lakes . The surface of the water was chipped and furrowed , streaked with windrows of scud . By the side of the road ( another deserted blacktop , Route 14 , on the Washington shore ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . This miserable , gale-tormented plant had been new to the explorers , who referred to it , doubtfully , as " whins " and " wild Isoop . " The feelings of the early settlers , trying to find words to convey the extraordinary barrenness of the valley , were plain from the names on the map . To the north , Sand Ridge ; to the south , Poverty Ridge . There was a hamlet called , with a grimly literal eye for the landscape 's salient feature , Sage . Beyond Sage was Dead Canyon . Beyond Dead Canyon was Golgotha Butte . The West was named , in English , at a time when almost every frontier sod house and log cabin contained a copy of Pilgrim 's Progress , housed next to the Bible . Huckleberry Finn notices the book in the Grangerford house : There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table . One was a big family Bible full of pictures . One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read considerable in it now and then . The statements was interesting , but tough . The fur trappers , farmers , fishermen , and loggers were comfortable with Bunyan 's landscape of allegory . ( Was Paul Bunyan 's name meant as a respectful nod to John Bunyan ? Certainly the Bunyan stories have a distinct Pilgrim 's Progress flavor . ) The settlers were used to a topography in which places had names like the Slough of Despond , the Hill of Difficulty , the Delectable Mountains , Lucre Hill , the River of the Water of Life , and the Valley of the Shadow of Death . Western names ! Migrants to the West found themselves living in a landscape that must have seemed more like the country described in Pilgrim 's Progress ( or the Book of Revelation ) than anywhere in the conventional realistic world . It looked allegorical , and allegorical names came to attach themselves to it : Damnation Peak , Mount Despair , Lucky Canyon , Starvation Point . When Lewis called the Jefferson River 's twin forks Philanthropy and Wisdom , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian might wander as he does through Bunyan 's book . Past Golgotha Butte , the windsurfers began The Columbia Gorge gathers in the westerly winds of the Pacific and focuses them like a nozzle . It is one of the great wind funnels of the world , and its effect is exaggerated by the way the sun-dried desert land east of the Cascades forms a pressure vacuum that sucks in the cool wet oceanic air . So an almost continuous westerly gale blows through the lower Columbia valley , burnishing the rock bluffs and keeping the sagebrush down to a thin and close-cropped fur . It made the going rough for the explorers . " Wind hard from the west all the last night and this morning ... a very windy night ... a windey morning ... a Violent wind .... " Their canoes lurched and pounded through the lop on the river , often taking in water . But the surfers loved the windiness of it . They came from all over . I first heard about this roaring chasm in the bar of the Isle of Man Yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his ambition to spend a long season crisscrossing one short patch of water on the Columbia River . He showed me a picture of the place in a magazine : I barely glanced at it but nodded politely , thinking him an amiable madman who required humoring . Now I saw his point . Each wet-suited windsurfer had the rigid crouch of a toy gladiator as he skidded hard across the wind on his psychedelic wing . The people made sudden , happy sense of the harsh topography : for a moment , they made the Columbia look homely , in a solitary , northwestern sort of way . There were at least a dozen of them in view , but there was no apparent relation between them . They were n't racing ; it was n't a regatta . Everyone was striking out on a free-lance course of his or her own , each at a different angle to the wind , sailing as people lived here , unsociably and at cross-purposes . I thought of the Manxman , slow-spoken and somber . During the year I spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke up with his fiance in order to devote himself to his sailboard . Driving on the coast road to Douglas in the dead of winter , past a sea of blown spume and boiling milk , I 'd catch sight of a triangular scrap of rainbow in the storm  --  the ex-bank clerk at his devotions . The beef-pink , horse-faced loner was made for the Pacific Northwest : put him in a shack at the mouth of Melancholy Canyon and he 'd pass as a native of the place . As the Cascade mountains began to crowd around the river , the color of the landscape slowly changed from tan to green . The first fir tree came and went ; sparse woodland thickened into forest , and National Public Radio was back on the air , broadcasting from Portland . For the past few days I had been living in a chronological fog , and it came as no particular surprise to learn that the man in the news today was Warren Christopher  --  a name I had n't heard for so many years that it sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving long enough in the deep sticks and you might tune in to find Cokie Roberts interviewing John Quincy Adams . The road ran abruptly and unambiguously into the fall of 1992 , with a lumber mill pumping steam into the overcast , some muddy acres of building lots and show homes , a tangle of concrete ramps and two freeways , straddling the Columbia on high bridges . The whole landscape was permeated with the flatulent reek of the timber industry . I had meant to stop in Portland but . took the wrong ramp and found myself headed north on Interstate 5 , bound for Seattle and Vancouver . At the next exit I kept on going , and left the gassy city far astern . Even on this Sunday afternoon I-5 was clogged . It was the main Mexico-to-Canada highway west of the Rocky Mountains , a 1,300-mile-long concrete duct that had been a marvel in its time but was now an end-to-end traffic jam . I made a slot for myself in the slow-moving stream and settled in . It was restful to have no more landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of a big milk truck , like grimy blank page . I quit the interstate and headed northwest for the Olympic Peninsula and the Pacific coast . The road was a dead-straight furrow through rolling plantations of black firs  --  an enormous canopy of darkness held up by bare gray tree trunks , standing as thick on the ground as stalks of wheat . The trees were of the kind that timber-industry people call " pecker poles "  --  all height and no circumference , like hundred-foot broomsticks . Over their tops was spread a smothering sky of oily-looking rain clouds like a dirty eiderdown . These were the foothills of the razor-edged Olympics , but from the road one could no more guess at the existence of the mountains than one could tell the time of day . Mile after mile slid by of the same dank , unpeopled lightlessness , relieved by the occasional patch of clear-cutting . Great tracts of the Pacific Northwest , like this one , resembled the interior landscape of manic depression . They ran through the same exhausting cycle . For days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this natural dungeon where things grew like some fungal runaway mold . Then , without warning , the sky would clear and you 'd find yourself suddenly open to the high white heights , and watch as the world changed color in an instant , from vegetable black to brilliant moss green . Foot down through the forest , I kept going until at last the ocean showed , like the ultimate clear-cut , as a lightsome vacancy beyond the trees . T parked the Dodge and walked down to the beach . The sky was higher and thinner here , and there was even a meager ration of evening sunlight , enough to make the big , half-sunken drift logs cast distinct shadows on the sand . Though there was barely enough wind to keep the pine needles in motion , the sea drummed and rumbled like the traffic on an overhead expressway as the incoming swell broke on the beach . I sat on a log and listened to the sea . " The Sea which is imedeately in front roars like a repeeted roling thunder , " wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since our arrival in its borders which is now 24 Days Since we arrived in Sight of the Great Western Ocian , I cant say Pasific as Since I have Seen it , it has been the reverse . " The Pacific rollers came bursting onto the beach like exploding snowdrifts . Each one started off as an unambitious crease , a pencil line on the smooth water a hundred and fifty yards out , where the swell tripped on the shallowing sand bottom . With ponderous slowness , the crease sharpened and built into a translucent crest , through which the dying sunlight showed as through bubbled green bottle-glass . Now the whole wave was really on the up-and-up . Sixty or seventy yards off , it sprouted a thin white handlebar mustache , which widened rapidly along its lip . It kept on climbing . And climbing . The force of gravity appeared o have been suspended to enable its magnificent ascent . The arched wave hung in space , as thick and viscous-looking as a tower of treacle . Then came the break  --  a ground-shaking crash that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed into powder , then reformed itself back into water again . The night I put up at a motel in Forks , twelve miles inland , on the slope of the invisible Olympics . It was a timber town , and a minor classic in its genre . I had been driving through timber towns all day and seen them at every stage of their evolution . Forks was the most highly evolved version so far . The lowest form of timber-industry social life was a camp of trailers parked in line along the roadside . It became a town with a name when the trailers were joined by three or four prefabricated ranch-style bungalows and a 7-Eleven convenience store with a gas pump out front . The next stage up the ladder required the addition of a gas station with a " deli " ( which in these parts meant not a delicatessen but a basic horseshoe-counter diner , serving steak-and-egg breakfasts and sandwiches ) . Serious civic ambitions set in with the arrival of the video store and the motel . After that came the sculpture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bronze infantryman atop the war memorial in small English market towns . I 'd seen a dozen variants of it in Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia . It was carved from a section of old-growth Douglas fir of massive diameter , and it represented , in heavy relief , sometimes painted and sometimes in bare varnished wood , a logger with an ax cutting down an old-growth Douglas fir . The example outside the motel was a beauty , for Forks was the metropolis of the logging camps  --  a mile-long strip of neon business signs , with three stoplights and a string of tenebrous beer joints . But the carved and painted logger , a figure of heroic pastoral , was way out of tune with his real-life counterparts , who gloomed disconsolately over their drinks in the bars . None were Paul Bunyan types . The loggers were journeyman employees of billion-dollar outfits like the Weyerhaeuser Corporation , and they gave off the sour smell of years of negative profits , evaporating cash flows , and hard bottom lines . They were now the endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said THIS FAMILY LIVES ON TIMBER DOLLARS  --  and I 'd find myself peering in at the windows of these houses as if , indeed , I might catch a glimpse of some rare owlish birds pecking at a tray of timber dollars while Wheel of Fortune played in the background . The sculptures ( and all the ones I saw were recently carved ) were part of the counter-preservationist movement . They owed a lot to the carved totemic ravens and thunderbirds with which the local Indian tribes announced their special status . They made the assertion that timber-industry workers , like the Indians , had , in one of the hardest-worked American phrases of the late twentieth century , a unique and historic culture . Deny me my job , and you deny me my culture , my past , my ethnic identity . So the logging communities were busy manufacturing craft objects that gave them a tribal history and the right to be regarded as yet another beleaguered minority threatened with extinction . It took some imaginative effort to identify the Weyerhaeuser fork-lift operators and helicopter crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sculptures seemed to me to be self-defeating : they came across as sentimental tributes to a past so long gone that it was far beyond the reach of preservation . I picked at a meal in an overlit , almost empty restaurant . The view through the window was of pickups and logging trucks plowing through the wet and dark . The chicken and French fries tasted of sawdust and wood pulp . The only other customer removed his teeth and pocketed them after he 'd finished dining . Forks in the rain was an unlovely place . An elderly blue VW Beetle was stopped at the light . Its back end was pasted over with slogans that looked misplaced in Forks anti-nuke , Clinton/Gore , and the brightest piece of folk wisdom that I 'd yet seen on the tribulations of the timber industry , SAVE A LOGGER &; A WHALE  --  SINK A JAPANESE SHIP . The north shore of the peninsula , a hillocky strip of mixed woods and farmland , looked out over the hazy Strait of Juan de Fuca to the stranded thundercloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could see the westward drift of the level , tan-colored water , frosted with cat's-paws of wind . The land here had been settled at the turn of the century by handy and versatile people . First they had been loggers . They cleared their plots and sold the timber to the mills in Port Angeles . Then they pulled the stumps out of the ground and planted it with grain , or turned it over to pasture . When the salmon were running in the strait , the settlers became fishermen , and supplied the canning factories . As hunters , they sold venison to Seattle butchers . They lived much like the Makah Indians whom they had supplanted , except that the whites lived , penny-wise , on their surpluses , selling everything they could chop down , raise , catch , grow , pick , or shoot . These busy small capitalists  --  lately the poor of Sweden , Germany , and the British Isles  --  had left their names on the map . Bagley , Charley , Macdonald , Morse , Petersen , Sadie were creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liljedahl , Pearson were roads ; Snider , Stolzenberg , Ellis , Muller were hills . The landscape was dotted with derelict farms  --  barns and windowless houses going down on their knees , their timbers splayed , their roofs collapsing under a heavy thatch of moss . Few of the names on the map now matched the names of living residents , but Schmidt Road , by Whiskey Creek , still led to the Schmidt house . A little way down the unpaved trail , I disturbed a pair of skinny coyotes , who loped unhurriedly away from the Dodge , heads down , tails at half-mast . At the road 's end was a small sandy bay with a cathedral-like cedar A-frame perched on the edge of the water . Bud Schmidt was home . We 'd been introduced a couple of months before , when I had come this way with a friend , an ex-towboat captain who knew everybody . We 'd stopped here for tea , and Mr. Schmidt had delivered an eloquent and memorious tirade that made me ache for a pen and notebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped . I said I 'd seen the coyotes  --  my first at such close quarters . " Coyotes , " Mr. Schmidt said , pronouncing the word as one might say " crack dealers . " " Oh , you 'll see coyotes . The coyotes will be cleaning up when every last damn thing is gone . " He led the way into the house , a bulky septuagenarian in baggy overalls . He was stooped with arthritis and moved with the stealth of a burglar , trying to hide his intentions from his own easily alarmed joints . The Schmidt living room was un-Americanly cozy . It was full of ordinary things , slowly accumulated over the best part of a hundred years . Though this house had been built quite recently by Bud Schmidt , he had been born " on the property , " and the room , warmed by pine logs grumbling in the potbellied stove , felt as old as the century ; an easygoing , patched-at-the-elbows place , full of old photographs , old papers , old tools , with a loudly ticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boil . Its big picture window gave onto the bay  --  the woods crowding to the water , the ruffled strait , gulls doing aerial stunts in the clearing blue , and the far loom of forested hills on the Canadian shore . A brassbound telescope on a tripod pointed out to sea . Standing by the window , I exclaimed about the view and heard myself sound like an out-of-control realtor . Mr. Schmidt , settling himself cautiously into a rocker , allowed that it might look pretty to an uneducated eye . " People now , they talk about how clear the water is  --  how you can see right to the bottom . Used to be it was all milky here . You could n't see more than a few inches down . Then you 'd look a little closer , and you 'd see that milkiness was life . It was things swimming . It was all kinds of small sea life . Now all that life 's gone . It 's getting clearer all the time . Used to be , you 'd look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see would be salmon jumping . Any one moment , there 'd be a thousand splashes out there  --  many , many more than you could take in with your eye . That whole sea was alive with salmon . Now ... " He laughed  --  a sour , small , knowledgeable laugh , an audible shrug , with no amusement in it at all . Mr. Schmidt 's hands moved impatiently in the lap of his overalls . His fingers were swollen and knotted . He looked at them rather than at me , and spoke in a voice insistent and repetitive , like a rusty hinge . " We had a tremendous lot of little animals and birds that are n't here anymore . We had bluebirds  --  there is none . We had killdeer snipe  --  he 's gone . We had whippoorwill  --  he 's gone . We had a huge amount of woodpeckers  --  they 're all gone . We had grouse , we had quail , we had rabbit , we had several different kinds of weasels . We had mink , we had otter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't built the road ditches back then  --  and we had birds in the swamps . Ducks . We had peregrine falcons eating off the ducks , we had preys eating off the salmon . We had God knows how many little parasite animals like mice , and different things like that  --  they 're all gone . We had two different kinds of skunk , the spotted one and the striped one . We had frogs , we had toads , we had salamanders , and we had some of those green tree frogs , and in the last few years they 've all disappeared  --  " Mrs. Schmidt had come in from the kitchen , where she was cooking lunch . She listened to her husband for a moment , as if to check which part of his recital he had reached so far , and said , " Not all of them , Bud  --  not quite all ... " " We had bears in the creek , they 're all gone . " He blamed the timber industry for most of what had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural drainage pattern . Either water poured off the sides of the hills in flash floods or the creeks went dry . Floods washed away the gravel shallows where the salmon had used to spawn , and there was rarely enough water in the creek for the fish to swim up from the sea . " When you do one thing , it takes a very ) round-the-house way . Like you get hit from several sides , not one blow on the head . When they cut down on the creek so you did n't get many fish , that meant there was n't a whole lot of dead salmon coming out into the strait . Well  --  there went the crabs , see ? When the salmon went down , it disposed of a whole cycle of food : it was n't just fish that went , it was bear , it was coon , it was eagles and sea gulls and crows and mink and otter and skunk and weasel ... " His tone was sorrowing but not entirely so . It was tinged with the modest satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plagues of hail and scorpions , the frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon , the sea of fire  --  and who still has the scarlet whore of Babylon up his sleeve . " When did this breakdown start ? " " We knew things were wrong by the 1950s  --  we knew it then . But it was n't until the 1970s that people began to say that we should turn this around . And then it was only talk . Now ... " He vented his unamused , prophet 's laugh . " It 's sad . But that 's the way the world is . " I was back at the window , looking out . " Used to be , you 'd see as many eagles out there as you can see gulls now . " This time I laughed . " Well  --  something like that . " Lunch was ready . As Mrs. Schmidt brought the dishes to the table , I saw that she 'd been mounting her own counterargument in the kitchen . The meal said Not all , Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , from the venison and the vegetables to the apples in the apple pie . It was a meal to write home about  --  the great American meal , which provided the main substance of thousands of letters home to Europe at the turn of the century . This was how the emigrant cousins were rumored to live  --  like noblemen , on oysters , smoked salmon , game , and strawberries . It was tales of meals like this that made the rural poor of Europe pile into transatlantic steamers . Eating like a king , Bud Schmidt nodded at the strait where no fish jumped , at least not at that precise second . It was n't so long ago , he said , since the gill-netters used to form a continuous boat-to-net-to-boat fence across the strait , all the way from here to Vancouver Island . You 'd watch them lying lower and lower in the water until only a few inches of gunwale amidships showed above the surface ; then they 'd peel off to the canning factories on both the American and Canadian sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a flat calm , under the preposterous load of eleven thousand salmon ; the three fishermen shouting and splashing in the bloody welter of dead and dying fish . He made a clean plate and clasped his hands in front of him on the table . Eyeing his swollen finger joints , he said , " The creek now , it 's this puddle . And no life in it . " Mrs. Schmidt , slicing into the apple pie , said nothing , but Mr. Schmidt turned on her as if she 'd contradicted him . " Even the loons are gone . " Back on the road , laden with lunch and homeward bound , I tried out the wizened view for size and saw coyote country . The dozen miles between Port Angeles and Sequim were turning fast into a continuous strip of car dealerships , chain drug and hardware stores , Kmart plazas , and hamburger drive-thrus . A few hundred yards ahead there was a happy thing  --  a sun-bleached timber grain silo , rising like an ancient church tower over the one-story slum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it drew closer it showed itself to be a grain silo no longer : it had been colonized by a Mexican restaurant chain and now it was all-you-can-eat tacos and nachos . A sign flashed past : WILD BIRD SEED  --  CHEEP ! CHEEP ! 25 LBS $5.50 . Even the birds  --  those that remained  --  were on fast food here . Halted at a stoplight , though , I found my gaze drifting : to the left , and the strait , like a bolt of green shot-silk ; to the right , and the Olympic Mountains , their snowfields turning rosy in the afternoon sun . The strip of development appeared to be no more than a long scratch  --  not even a flesh wound  --  on the face of the country . If you searched the sky , you 'd see eagles circling there ; if you went for a walk in the high woods , you 'd find the scat of mountain lions and black bears . If the people were to leave , the trees would cover the scratch tomorrow : Kmart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas firs poked through , and Walgreen 's would sink gracefully into mossy ruin . Tomorrow . I thought of Mr. Schmidt . When he looked out from his fastness in the deep countryside , all he saw were absences and all he heard was the incriminating silence of the sandy beach at his feet and the empty branches over his head . Yet it was no less true a fact that when I looked out from our upstairs living room in the city , I marveled , time and again , at the profusion of nature in the Northwest . The list of birds watched from our urban deck now ran to ospreys and eagles , cedar waxwings , red-shafted flickers , pine siskins , varied thrushes , nuthatches , ruby-crowned kinglets ... Of course Mr. Schmidt was right ; but so was I. Hopefulness is always callow when it rubs up against well-informed pessimism , yet I could n't kill the stubborn gut feeling that  --  abused and damaged as it was  --  this was still , just , the most possible landscape in which I 'd ever traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Past Sequim the road bent south , back into the inky green of fir and hemlock , and dusk returned the tree farms to the towering darkness of original forest . The northern spotted owl might disdain it ( too few dead branches in which to set up home , too few voles and flying squirrels on which to dine ) , but a plantation of forty-year-old trees after nightfall is as deep , and looms as witchily , as any forest in a German fairy tale . A harvested break in the woods framed a sea of creased black oilskin , under the low and growing moon . I caught the 7:40 ferry from Bainbridge across Puget Sound to Seattle seconds before it was unshackled from the dock . Up in the lounge a sprinkling of commuters sat in withdrawn silence like subway passengers . Puget Sound was a time , not a place : it was twenty-five minutes , and the ferry was six minutes late . The wind was blowing out of the south and a lumpy sea was running . Seattle , five miles off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous bloom of luminous plankton in the water , a phosphorescent city . It had a watery depth and a watery brilliance  --  a great floating exhibition of glowing silver office towers and glowing amber streets . After the miles of woody darkness , I found myself quite unprepared for the dizzy splendor of Seattle , climbing and spreading round the ferry as it plowed across the sound at eighteen knots . Seattle was a western city , built in a wilderness and designed to dazzle . To get it right you were meant to approach like this , as a fisherman back from the Gulf of Alaska , a logger coming in from the forest , or a salesman returning from his huge and far-flung territory , and you were meant to feel an explosion of pride in the sheer brazen unlikeliness of it  --  this sky-high glittering metropolis in a hilly clearing in the firs . Country life in the West , around the mill , the cannery , the logging camp , was slovenly , and most settlements were ramshackle affairs , thrown together in a hurry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended as a spectacular proof that western life could be dignified , cultured , permanent ; the city was everything that the country was not . Wood was the material of the rural outback ; Seattle ( after the fire of 1889 , which destroyed the first , mainly wooden city ) craved marble , granite , sandstone , and brick  --  as it craved height , to set itself apart from the single-story villages of its hinterland . The city was a heroic attempt to create , in a wild and remote place , all the appearances of a long civilized past . It was a jumble of allusions  --  to the storybook history of classical empires , to the famous monuments of Europe , to such fragments of the recent past as a favorite park , a chophouse , a New York apartment block . It was a homesick city , full of memories  --  of Stockholm and Copenhagen , as of the high life of Manhattan  --  and its most basic tone was that of a determinedly bright letter home .... We 're doing fine here . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater and see the very latest things from the East only a few months after you ... You would be amazed by Henry 's office  --  on the 28th floor ... We 're kept so busy here ! ... Honestly , we 're doing fine ! ... Please write soon .... As the ferry passed from the sound into Elliott Bay , the city lights closed round it , enfolding the ship in their ambit , and I was proud of Seattle , as one was meant to be . I followed the swarm of house lights up Queen Anne Hill , to the TV towers on the summit with their slowly winking red aerobeacons . The lights of our house were just out of sight , over the brow of the hill , and it seemed , in the moments before the ferry locked into its berth , that this was always how it was out here , to be so far abroad , so nearly home .
