In LONDON , I KEPT WONDERING about everything . I wondered what it meant to be civilized . Over there I was so self-conscious about being an American  --  a wayward overseas cousin , crude and immature . I wondered if tea built character , and if Waterloo used to be slang for water closet and then got shortened to " loo . " Did Princess Di shop on sunny Goodge Street And why did it take high-heeled sneakers so long to become a fashion  --  decades after " Good Golly Miss Molly ? " I wondered why here was so much music in London . The bands listed in Time Out made it seem there was a new wave , an explosion of revolutionary energy blasting from the forbidding dance clubs of Soho . The names were clever and demanding : the New Fast Automatic Daffodils , the Okey Dokey Stompers , Tea for the Wicked , Bedbugs , Gear Junkies , Frank the Cat , Velcro Fly , Paddy Goes to Holyhead . But the dismal , disheveled teens who passed me. on Oxford Street made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squall-pop , coming out of the desperation of the bottom classes . Yet I wondered what rough beast now was slouching toward its birth . I had an open mind . <p> However , I was n't prepared for what happened in London . I was cut loose  --  on holiday , as they said in Britain . I had little money and no job to go home to , so this was more of a fling than a vacation on retreat ? ) at a Trappist monastery . He had immersed himself in Thomas Merton books . Andy was very serious-minded and had high cholesterol . Actually , I believe he found Merton glamorous , but I always remembered the electric fan in India that electrocuted him  --  an object lesson for transcendental meditators , I thought . I was separated from Jack , my husband . New-Age Andy had been my midlife course correction , but now he was off to count beads and ho beans , or whatever the monks do there at Gethsemane . When he was a child , my son saw the dark-robed monks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monk farm . I did n't know what I 'd do about Andy . He was virtuous , but he made me restless . I knew I was always trying to fit in and rebel simultaneously . My husband called that the Marie Antoinette paradox . <p> I was all alone in London , so in a way I was on a retreat , too . I had a borrowed flat in Bloomsbury for a month . My old college friend Louise worked in London as a government translator , and she was away , translating for a consulate in Italy . Back in the ' 60s , the summer after our junior year , Louise and I had gone to Europe together  --  " Europe on $5 a Day . " During that miserable trip Louise 's mother died and was already buried by the time the news reached us in Rome . We did n't know what to do but grimly continue our travels . We ended up in England , and we took a train to the Lake District , where we met some cute guys from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise 's flat was on a brick-paved mews just off Bloomsbury Avenue . <p> It stood at the street level , and all the flats had window boxes of late-fall blooms . There was no backyard garden  --  just as well , since I did n't want to mother plants . I was n't sure what I wanted to do . I was supposed to be thinking . Or maybe not : thinking . I wondered if I should go back to Jack . I did n't want to rush back automatically , like a boomerang . <p> Two days after my arrival from Cincinnati , I still had my days and nights mixed up . On Sunday , I slept till well past two . After breakfast I went walking , a long way . I walked up Tottenham Court Road , past all the tacky electronics stores , to Regent 's Park . I walked through the park to the zoo . When I got there the zoo was closing . I decided not to head into the dim interior of the park but walked back the . way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the sun threw the bare trees into silhouette . <p> As I walked back to the flat , I kept thinking about Louise . I had n't seen her in five years , and we were never really close . She was always following some new career or set of people . She thrived on people and ideas , as if she hoped that any minute someone might come along with a totally new plan that would radically change her life . Her closet was a dull rainbow of business suits , with accessories like scarves and belts and necklaces looped with them on the hangers and a row of shoes below . Big earrings were stashed in the jacket pockets . There was nothing else in the flat that seemed personal , no knickknacks or collections . She was without hobbies . No stacks of magazines , only some recent issues of Vogue and a lone Time Out . There was nothing to be recycled or postponed . The cupboards had only a few packages of Bovril and tea , and the refrigerator had been thoroughly cleaned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew no one back home who hired someone to clean . In my neighborhood , in a small city on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains , if you hired somebody to clean or cook or mow , people would figure you had a lot of money and would hit you for a loan , or they would gossip . <p> Louise 's place was like a lawyer 's reception room . The art on the walls was functionala few posters from the National Gallery and a nondescript seascape . But in the hallway between the living room and the bedroom was a row of eight-by-ten glossy color photographs of raw turkeys . The photos were framed with thin red metal edges . In the first one the turkey was sitting upright and headless , its legs dangling , in a child 's red rocking chair . In the second , the turkey was sitting in the child 's compartment of a supermarket cart . I could make out the word Loblaw 's on the cart , so I knew the photographs were American . In the third one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a pet . In the last , it was buckled into a car seat . <p> I longed to show Jack these pictures . He was a photographer , and I knew he would hate them . The pictures were hideous , but funny , too , because the turkeys seemed so humanized . I had a son in college , but Louise had no children and had never married . Was this her creepy vision of children ? <p> It was almost dark when I reached the flat . A sprinkle of rain had showered the nodding mums in the window box . Clumsily I unlocked the outer door with an oversized skeleton key and switched on the light in the vestibule . Beyond this was a door with a different , more modern key . I opened the second door ; then a chill ran all over me . Something was wrong . I could see my duffel bag on the floor . I was sure I had left it in a hall closet . The room was dark except for the vestibule light . Frightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed the skeleton key into the lock and turned it . At the corner I looked back , trying to remember if I had left the bedroom curtains parted a slight bit . Was someone peeking out ? <p> I walked swiftly to the nearest phone box , a few blocks away , and called the number Louise had left me , a friend of hers in case I needed help . It was an 081 number  --  too far away to be of immediate help , I thought . A machine answered . At the beep I paused , then hung up . <p> I might have been mistaken , I thought . I could be brave and investigate . I walked back  --  three long blocks of closed book shops and sandwich bars . It would be embarrassing to call the police and then remember I had left the bag on the floor . I had experienced deceptions of memory before and had a theory about them . I tried hard to think . Louise had assured me , " England is not like the States , Nancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those guns . " <p> I had some trouble getting the outer door unlocked . I was turning the key the wrong way . I had to turn it several times . When I got inside , I fit the other key to the second door , but it pushed open before I could turn he key . It should have locked automatically when I closed it before , but now it was open . I could see my bag there , but I thought it might have traveled six inches forward . Now I realized that the outer door had been unlocked , too . I fumbled again with the awkward skeleton key . Then I rushed past the bookstores and the sandwich bars to the call box , where I learned the police was 999 , not 911 . <p> " I think my flat has been broken into , " I said as calmly as I could . <p> A friendly female voice took down the information . " Please tell me the address . " <p> I gave her the address . " I 'm American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Right . " The voice paused . The way the English said " Right " was as if they were saying , " Of course . knew that . " You ca n't surprise them . <p> " I thought London was supposed to be safe , " I said . " I never expected this . " In my nervousness , I was babbling . Instantly I realized <p> had probably insulted the London police for not doing their job . <p> " Do n't worry , madam . I 'll send someone straight away . " She repeated the address and told me to stand on the . corner of Bloomsbury Avenue . <p> I waited on the corner , my hands in the pockets of my rain parka . People were moving about casually . The street seemed normal enough , and I was aware that I did n't believe anything truly calamitous could happen to me . This felt like an out-of-body experience , except that I needed to pee . Soon four policemen rode up in a ridiculous little red car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bobbies " anymore . ( Not P.C. ? I had no idea . ) Two of them stayed with the car , and two approached the flat , asking me questions . They took my keys . <p> " Stay across the street , please , madam , while we check out the situation . " The bobby appeared to be about twenty . He was cute , with a dimple . His red hair made me think of Jack when we first met . <p> They whipped out their billy sticks and braced themselves at the door . It was a charming scene , I thought , as they entered the flat . I did n't want to think about what the cops in America would do . In a few minutes , the older of the two bobbies appeared and motioned me inside . <p> " Right , " he said . " This is a burglary . " <p> Inside , the place was like a jumble sale . All the drawers had been jerked from their havens and spilled out . The kitchen cupboards were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes were strewn about , and Louise 's preaccessorized suits lay heaped on the floor , the earrings and necklaces scattered . I was so stunned that I must have seemed strangely calm . The police might have thought I had staged the whole affair . Louise 's place had been so spare that now with things flung around it seemed almost homey . <p> " Was there a telly ? " said the bobby with the red hair . <p> It dawned on me that the telly trolley was vacant . <p> " Why , yes , " I said , pointing to the trolley . " And . there was a radio in the kitchen . " <p> " No more , " he said . " Was there a CD player or such " <p> I shook my head no . Louise never listened to music . How could she like languages and not music ? <p> " The TV , the radio , and about a hundred dollars cash  --  American dollars , " I told the policemen after I had searched a while . The cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . I had no idea what hidden valuables of Louise 's might have been taken . My traveler 's checks were still in the GuateImalan ditty bag I had hidden in a sweater . The burglars must have been in a rush . I had probably interrupted them . The phone-fax was still there . The turkey pictures were hanging askew . <p> The bobbies wrote up a report . They gave me advice . " Get a locksmith right away and have the lock changed , " Bobby the Elder urged . <p> Bobby the Younger beckoned me into the vestibule . " You see how they got in ? The outside door should have been double-locked . See the brass plate of the letter box ? They could poke an instrument through the slot and release the handle inside . Then it was a simple matter to force the lock on the second door . It could be done with a credit card . " <p> " It could . have been Gypsies , " Bobby the Elder said . " There 's Gypsies about quite near here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , " the younger bobby reminded me when they left a bit later . He seemed worried about me . I tried to smile . I coveted his helmet . <p> In the telephone book , I chose a locksmith named Smith because the name seemed fitting . His ad said , " Pick Smith for your locks . " While I was waiting , I tried to clean up the place . hid Louise 's kitchen knives behind the pots and pans . I looked for clues . Under a book on the floor , I found a framed photograph of Louise 's parents . They stared up at me as if I had caught them being naughty . <p> Smith came promptly , arriving with a tool kit and a huge sandwich  --  a filled bap , like a hamburger bun stuffed with potted meat . He set it on the dining table . <p> " You 'll be needing a few bolts , " he announced , after examining the doors . <p> " Could I ask you to block up the letter slot somehow " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the slot . <p> Smith flipped the brass plate a couple of times . He frowned . " How would you get the post ? " <p> " I 'm not expecting any letters . " Andy might write , but that did n't matter . Jack did n't even know where I was . <p> " I could screw it down , " Smith said begrudgingly . He was a heavyset man who looked as though he worked out at a gym . He wore clean , creased green twill . Between bites of his bap , he shot an electric screwdriver into the lock plate of the living room door and removed some screws . The sound was insect-shrill . <p> " Likely this was committed by some Pakis , " he said , pausing in his attack . " The Pakis are worse than the Indians . " <p> " I would n't know , " I murmured . I was trying to remember where Louise 's parents belonged . I had tried them out in the bedroom , but they looked too disapproving . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Some of them look you right in the eye . " <p> " I would n't jump to conclusions , " I said . I plumped a sofa cushion . <p> " But you know how it is with the blacks in your country . " A screw dropped to the floor . <p> I did n't know what to say . I was n't used to hearing people tossing around such remarks , but as an American I did n't seem to have a right to say much . " Have you ever been to America ? " I asked . <p> " No . But I long to take the kids to Disney World . " He scooped up the screw . " Maybe one day , " he added wistfully . <p> After that , I toured London by fury . I walked everywhere , replaying what had happened , hardly seeing the sights . I walked right past Big Ben and did n't notice until I heard it strike behind me . " England swings , like a pendulum do , bobbies on bicycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I walked the streets , confusion growing inside me like a ball of calzone . I saw signs on walls of unoccupied stores : FLY STICKERS WILL BE KNACKERED <p> It sounded so violent , like " liquidated " or " exterminated . " <p> I found that I was talking to myself on the street . A teapot was a grenade . A briefcase could be a car bomb . There were guns . I remembered the time Jack and I went with our little boy to see the crown jewels . It was 1975 . We were waiting in a long line  --  Louise would say queue  --  to see the royal baubles , and an alarm went off . A group of baby-faced young men in military uniforms materialized , their M-16s trained on the tourists . Any one of us might be an IRA terrorist . <p> The cacophony on the major streets was earsplitting . On the Pall Mall , the traffic was hurtling pell-mell . The boxy hansom cabs maneuvered like bumper cars , their back wheels holding tight while the front wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ads screeched to a halt right in front of me and let me trot the crosswalk . Angrily I marched to Westminster Abbey , aiming for the Poets ' Corner . I had a bone to pick with the poets . You could n't dance to all those old words . And where were they when you needed them I had to elbow through a crowd of tourists earnestly working on brass-rubbings . A sign warned that pickpockets operated in the area . I never followed directions and refused to ask where the Poets ' Corner was . I was sure . I 'd find them , lurking in their guarded grotto . I walked through a maze of corridors , stepping on the gravestone lids of the dead . A great idea , I thought , walking over the dead . I stomped on their stones , hoping to disturb them . Then I saw an arrow pointing toward the Poets ' Corner . But a man in a big red costume steered me away and pointed to a velvet rope . <p> " Why ca n't I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's past four o'clock , " he said . <p> I did n't know the poets shut up shop at teatime . Slugabeds and lay-abouts , I thought vehemently . Pick a poet 's pocket  --  pocketful of rye ? Would prisoners have more self-esteem if their bars had a velvet veneer I wended my way past a woman in a battery-powered chair that resembled a motor scooter . I skirted the suggested-donation box and plowed around a crash of schoolchildren . <p> I left the poets to their tea and hit the gift shop . <p> At the Virgin Megastore on Oxford Street I searched for music . Everything was there , rows and racks of CDs and singles of folk and gospel and classical and ragga and reggae and rock and pop and world . The new Rolling Stones blared over the p.a . No moss on Mick Then a group I could n't identify caught me up in an old-style rock-and-roll rhythm . I breezed through the store , buoyed by the sound . I had to find out what it was . t was a clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reading about but could n't hear in the soundless turkey decor of Louise 's flat . <p> " What group is playing " I asked a nose-ringed clerk . <p> " Bob Geldof and the Boomtown Rats , from their greatest hits CD , " he said , smiling so that his nose ring wiggled . " Circa ' 78 . " <p> Where had I been all these years ? Why did n't I know this Did this mean I was old The song ended . The Virgin Megastore was so huge and so stimulating I felt my blood sugar dropping . There was too much to take in . Whole walls of Elvis . <p> At the British Museum , I stared at ancient manuscripts . I saw something called a chronological scourge . It was a handwritten manuscript in the form of a " flagellation , " an instrument used in ritual self-discipline for religious purposes . The chronicle was a history of the world , written on strips of paper streaming from the end of a stick . There was a large cluster of the shreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flagellating himself at the monastery . A paper scourge would n't hurt . It would only tickle and annoy , like gnats . Birch bark twigs would give pleasure . Rattan would smart and dig . Barbed wire would maim . <p> For two days I kept telephoning Louise , getting no answer at the villa in Italy where she was supposed to be . Then I got an answering machine , Louise in Italian . I guessed at the message , heard the beep , and blurted out the story . " Do n't worry , " I said . " There was n't any damage . Just the telly and the radio and nothing broken . I had to change the locks . " I asked her to let me know about the insurance . I did n't tell her about the gagged letter slot and how I found her mail littering the mews because I kept missing the postman . I knew she would say telly and not TV . Louise had gotten so English she would probably have tea during an air raid . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparkle-water . The waitress brought some vegetable antipasto . Then she brought bread . I ate slowly , trying to get my bearings . I knew what Andy would do : purify , simplify , and retreat . He 'd listen to his Enya records , those hollow whispers . I felt a deep hole inside , as when a family is shattered by some unspeakable calamity . The family at a table nearby was having a jovial evening , although I could not make out most of their conversation . A young man , perhaps in his thirties , had apparently met his parents for dinner . The father ordered Scrumpy Jack , and the son ordered a bottle of red wine . The mother pulled a package from a bag . It was gift-wrapped in sturdy , plain paper . The young man opened it  --  underwear  --  and discreetly repackaged it . He seemed grateful . <p> Another young man arrived , carrying a briefcase . The two young men kissed on the lips . Then the new arrival kissed the mother and shook hands with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table  --  diagonally across from the man whose birthday was evidently being celebrated  --  and removed a package from his briefcase . It traveled across the table . Some kind of book , I thought . No , it was a leather case filled with what looked like apothecary jars . The young man seemed elated . He lit a cigarette just as a young woman swept in , wearing a long purple knit tank dress with a white undershirt and white high-heeled basketball shoes . Her hair was short , as if Sinead O'Connor had n't shaved in a week or two . She handed the birthday boy a present . decided she was his sister . But maybe they were n't even a family . Maybe I was just jumping to conclusions , the way the locksmith did . <p> My main course arrived . Something with aubergines and courgettes . I could n't remember what courgettes were and could n't identify them in the dish . I knew aubergines were eggplants . I did n't know why the Italian menu used French words . I wondered if Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's death . Maybe she had wanted to translate her memories of those foreign sounds we heard that unforgettable day at the American Express office , near the Spanish steps , when she got the news from America . <p> Finally I spoke to Louise on the telephone . " Do n't worry about this little episode , Nancy , " she assured me . She had no hidden valuables that might be missing . We discussed the insurance details . I 'd get my hundred dollars , she 'd get her telly . <p> " The police said it might be Gypsies that live nearby , " offered . <p> " Oh , but those are proper Gypsies , " she said . " They do n't live in the council estates . " <p> Council estates meant something like public housing . " Proper Gypsies ? " I said , but she was already into a story about how a cultural attache 's estranged wife showed up in Rome . The Gypsies must live in regular flats like Louise 's , I thought . In America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsies . " Yes , they would , I realized . It was like saying " a good nigger . " I had a sick feeling . This was too deep for me . <p> " Louise , " I said firmly . " I 'm very disturbed . Listen . " I wanted to ask her about the Indians and Pakistanis , but I could n't phrase it . Instead , I said , " Remember when we went to Europe on five dollars a day ? " <p> " More like six , " she said with a quick little ha-ha . <p> " You know how I did n't know what to say to you when your mother died I was useless , not a comfort at all . " <p> " Why are you upset about that now ? " <p> " I just wanted to tell you I 'm really sorry . " <p> " Look , Nancy , " Louise said , in mingled kindness and exasperation . " I know you 're unnerved about being burgled . But you got the locks changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I believe you 're just not adjusted to your separation from Jack . " <p> " It 's not that , " I said quickly . " It 's the world . And the meaning of justice . Major stuff . " <p> " Oh , please . " <p> " Ciao , Louise . " <p> At a little shop , I bought detergent and a packet of flapjacks , just to find out what they were . I went to a laundrette : how did Louise do her wash The laundrette had a few plastic chairs baking in a sunny window . Two Indian women cleverly bandaged in filmy cotton were washing piles of similar cotton wrappings . They were laughing . One said , " She was doing this thing that thing . " She had beautiful hands , which she used like a musical accompaniment to her speech . It dawned on me that Louise 's maid did her wash  --  probably taking it home to her own neighborhood laundrette . I wondered if the proper Gypsies had maids . Technically , would n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold tooth , earrings , the works ? I sat on one of the h plastic chairs . In my pocket I had a fax from Andy  --  a fax from the monastery I did n't think I would answer his simple-Simon missive . could n't imagine a monk faxing . I waited in the laundrette , eating the flapjacks . They were a kind of Scottish oatcake mortared with treacle . The Scottish called crumpets pancakes . They had tea very late , giving the impression they could n't afford dinner . But the English had afternoon tea just early enough to make it seem they did n't have to work during the day and late enough to make it appear that they could have a late dinner . The English said " starters " for appetizers , a crude word instead of a French word . It was the direct language of my forebears , a culture that could be proper yet at times strangely without euphemism . They ate things they called toad in the hole , bubble and squeak , Spotted Dick , dead baby . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke my language , wore my skin . <p> I threw my jeans and T-shirts and socks into a spin dryer called The Extractor . It was a huge barrel encrusted with ancient grime and thick cables of electricity and with a box on the wall for coins . It looked like a relic from early Soviet technology , a grim reminder of something absolutely terrible . <p> At Trafalgar Square I was trying to get from Nelson 's column to Charing Cross , and I got caught up in a demonstration of some kind . With my plastic bag of laundry , I squeezed among a bunch of punks with electric-blue and orange mohawks . Spiritless teenagers in ragged , sloppy outfits propelled me through a flock of pigeons . I kept one hand on my belly-bag ; the pickpockets from Westminster Abbey were probably here . The poets stayed away , mumbling dead words in their niches . I could n't tell what the protest was , something about an employment bill . I saw turbans and saris and heard hot , rapid Cockney and the lilt of Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly move . My plastic bag of laundry followed me like a hump . Although it was scary , there was something thrilling about being carried along by the crowd . My anger started to dissolve and blend with this world of people , and I felt all of us swirling together to a hard , new rhythm . My hair was blowing . I could feel a tickle of English rain . A man next to me said " Four , four , four , " and the woman with him beat the air in time with her fists . Her earrings jangled and glinted . The scene blurred and then grew intensely clear by gradations . It was like the Magic Eye , in which a senseless picture magically turns into a 3-D scene when you diverge your eyes in an unfocused stare . As you relax into a deeper vision , the Magic Eye takes you inside the picture and you can move around in it and a hidden image flats forward . Inside the phantasmagoria of the crowd , everything became clear : the stripes and plaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacks . I saw T-shirts with large , red tie-dyed hearts , silver jewelry , gauzy skirts , a large hat with a feather , a yellow T-shirt that said STAFF . I saw a coat with many colors of packaged condoms glued over it . The surprise image that jumped into the foreground was myself , standing apart , transcendent . All my life I had . had the sense that any special , intense experience  --  a sunset , the gorgeousness of flowers , a bird soaring  --  was incomplete and never enough , because I was always so aware it would end that I would even look at my watch and wait for it to end . This was like that , in reverse . I knew the crush of the crowd had to cease . It was like an illusion of safety , this myth of one 's own invincibility . <p> Finally , I reached a crosswalk where a policeman had halted traffic and was rushing people across the street . I landed in front of the National Gallery . I joined a smaller throng inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and round madonnas . The driving piano of " Lady Madonna " bounced through my head . <p> I thought about the first time I visited England . It was in the summer of 1966 , and I was alone in London for a few days because . Louise had gone ahead to deal with her mother 's effects . It had been five weeks since her mother died . I was left alone , emptied of Louise and her grief . I was going home soon . The Beatles were going to America , too , to begin what turned out to be their last tour there . Their records were being burned in the States because John Lennon had commented offhandedly that L-he Beatles were more popular than Jesus . I figured he was right . The morning newspaper gave their flight number and departure time . It was a summons to their fans to wish them well on a dangerous , heroic journey . The Beatles ' vibrant rebellion had taken a somber turn . I decided to go to the airport and try to get a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved them fiercely , more than I 'd ever loved Jesus . I took the tube to the Heathrow station , then had to catch a shuttle bus . While I was waiting , a motorcade turned a corner right in front of me . It was a couple of police vehicles , with one of those black hansom cabs sandwiched between them . I realized it was the Beatles being escorted to their flight . I could see vague shapes in the back of the cab . I waved frantically . Through the dim glass I could n't tell which was which . But I knew they saw me , and I knew they were looking to America , cringing with dread at the interrogation they would face . They were looking at me , I was sure , and I was looking at my own reflection in the dark glass . <p> The rest is history . <p>
