In this season of the Winter Olympic Games , it 's appropriate to report record-breaking feats . This week we want to tell you about one of our own . The cover story for last week 's international edition of TIME , about Bosnia , was the 119th to be written by senior writer George Church  --  a record in the 71- year history of this magazine . Not one to rest on his laurels , Church is the author of our main story on the Hebron massacre , which ran on the cover of some of our international editions . Writers here tend to measure themselves in cover stories , much the way baseball players keep count of their home runs , which makes Church , in this league , something like Hank Aaron . <P> Time and again , Church is someone we rely on to bring order and perspective to major news stories  --  especially late-breaking events like the massacre and its aftershocks . " When you wake up on a Friday morning to a major news story like this one , you just automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who edited the Hebron stories . " He 's the master at knitting together complex breaking stories with sharp analysis and vivid prose  --  and he 's the fastest man in the place on deadline . " <P> Church 's great strength is his versatility . A year after arriving at TIME in 1969 , following 14 years at the Wall Street Journal , George wrote his first cover , on inefficiency in America . Twenty-one years later , he wrote his 100th , on the disintegration of the Soviet Union . At cover length , he has made sense of the secret sale of arms to Iran , the Los Angeles riots and the Reagan-era U.S. military buildup , among other subjects . So varied is his repertoire that this week 's issue also includes his one-page story on Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan . <P> Cover work can keep writers stationed at their keyboards into the wee hours of the night . " We shared many all-night writing chores on covers , " recalls former TIME senior writer Ed Magnuson , the previous record holder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ask George where to find some memorable quote in a correspondent 's files . ' Take 21 , page 3 , ' he would say  --  without a pause in his typing . " At 62 , Church , who loves fishing and serenading co-workers with his parodies of popular songs , is still propelled through the toughest stories by an undiminished excitement about news . " That internal charge that you get when you start on a story will keep you going for quite a long time , " he says . And we hope it continues for a long time to come .
