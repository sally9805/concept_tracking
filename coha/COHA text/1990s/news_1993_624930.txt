<p> IT WAS the strangest sight . Every tree not broken and fallen bent exactly the same way , all of them shaking themselves to pieces . <p> No sky . Just a wall of gray , spitting wet needles in your face . <p> And no sound but an unnerving white noise , part whistle and part moan , that never paused for breath and seemed to rise from some padlocked cellar of the brain . <p> Visibility was limited largely to one 's own feet , except when lightning or an exploding power transformer lit up familiar surroundings like the daylight that was still hours away . <p> It was also the strangest drive any fool ever took to work . <p> Disabled stoplights did a funky dance on sagging cables . A service-station sign twirled like a weather vane . <p> Debris from countless live oaks transformed South Main  --  as you watched and dodged , gripping the wheel  --  into terrain better suited for a jeep or a tank than a family sedan . <p> Once downtown , the streets and sidewalks stood littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panes from one building alone  --  that the wind had launched at projectile speeds . <p> For those of us lucky enough to get through unscathed , Hurricane Alicia was almost fun  --  at least it seems that way , looking back a decade . <p> For thousands in the Houston-Galveston area , it was a pure nightmare . Experts say the nightmare could recur . <p> Was it really 10 years ago Wednesday ? <p> Unlike most hurricanes on the Texas coast , Alicia did n't originate off Africa , meander across the Atlantic and wend its way through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico . <p> Instead , the costliest act of nature ever to hit Houston was born out of a small group of thunderstorms that had passed over the area and then stalled off the Louisiana coast , feeding off the warm , moist Gulf air . <p> At 4 p.m. on Monday , Aug. 15 , 1983 , the cluster officially became a tropical depression , and within an hour the National Weather Service had dubbed it Tropical Storm Alicia , signifying that the circling winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , and by 2 p.m . Tuesday an eye had formed . By 5 p.m. , wind speed had reached 75 mph and Alicia was officially a hurricane . <p> At 1:40 a.m. on Thursday , Aug.18 , the eye came ashore over San Luis Pass on the southwest end of Galveston Island . <p> Maximum winds were measured at 115 mph and the storm surge ( the tidelike swell pushed by the wind ) reached 12 feet . Numerous tornadoes were reported . <p> A rule of thumb says hurricanes lose 5 percent of their wind speed for every mile traveled over land , but Alicia did n't . It moved northward fast and was still swirling at 94 mph when it got to Houston , about 50 miles inland . <p> When residents emerged and took stock , 21 deaths were counted in the Houston-Galveston area , and more than 1,000 homes were destroyed . <p> An estimated 40,000 people would spend time in emergency shelters and up to 800,000 were without electricity or other basic services , some for 10 days or more . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains of Kansas , Hurricane Alicia had caused an estimated $ 2.3 billion in damage , making it the costliest hurricane ever in Texas and one of the costliest in U.S. history . <p> Even so , the figure is dwarfed by that of Hurricane Andrew , which struck Miami on Aug. 24 , 1992 , taking 24 U.S. lives and causing damage estimated as high as $ 25 billion , including $ 7.3 billion in insured losses . <p> Alicia inundated low-lying areas of Galveston Island and of coastal Brazoria and Harris counties . A month later , Baytown city council would declare the attractive Brownwood subdivision a total loss and bar its 300 families , or anyone else , from living there again . <p> Besides damaging or destroying numerous vacation homes , Alicia pushed back Galveston 's west beachfront 100 feet . This left several of the ruined structures beyond the vegetation line , so that under the state 's open beaches law property owners could not rebuild . <p> As bad as it was , it could have been much worse , according to a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The nation 's top hurricane forecaster , Dr. William Gray of Colorado State University , predicts that hurricane damage will be much worse in coming decades . <p> Alicia was only a weak Category 3 storm , which means it had wind speeds between 111 and 130 mph . <p> Ruch estimates that a strong Category 4 storm like Andrew , whose sustained winds reached 145 mph , with gusts to 175 mph , would have killed 30 people and cost $ 4.7 billion from wind and storm surge alone in coastal areas . <p> Those figures do n't include the likely destruction that would have occurred in Houston , which lies outside Ruch 's model and has over $ 40 billion worth of owner-occupied housing plus a million vehicles . <p> Ruch 's numbers also omit flood damage caused by rainfall . <p> Since Alicia moved so swiftly , that was n't a problem , but storm historians will recall that Tropical Storm Claudette dropped 43 inches of rain  --  a record for North America  --  between Houston and Galveston in 1979 . <p> The hurricane season runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecaster Gray predicts that before this year 's is over , there will be six hurricanes  --  two of them severe  --  and 10 named tropical storms in the Atlantic basin , which includes the ocean , the Caribbean and the Gulf . <p> So far , we 're beating the odds . The season is nearly halfway through , and we 've had only two tropical storms and no hurricanes . <p> But four out of five major hurricanes , Category 3 and above , form during just two of those months  --  August and September  --  and we 're only a quarter of the way through that meteorological minefield . <p> Gray 's forecasts of seasonal hurricane activity say nothing about where , or even whether , any of the storms will strike land . <p> On Aug. 5 , however , he made a dire prediction : <p> " " A return of increased major landfalling hurricane activity is to be expected in the next few decades , " Gray wrote in an update of his 1993 forecast , adding that the storms will cause " " hurricane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research on the causes and the likely time frame . . . is desperately needed , " said the researcher , who has lost a federal grant to continue his work . <p> Gray 's prediction of more destruction is based on two factors . The first is obvious : the huge increase in population and building in U.S.coastal areas . <p> At the turn of the century just 192,000 Texan residents , or one out of 16 , lived in the 17 coastal counties . By 1940 this ratio had risen to one in six , and in 1990 it was one in four , about 4.3 million people . <p> In Florida , the shift has been far more dramatic . Only 194,000 residents , or one in three , lived in a coastal county in 1900 , but nearly four out of five  --  10.1 million of the state 's 12.9 million people  --  did so in 1990 . <p> In Louisiana , the coastal population has grown from 474,000 to 1.5 million over the same period . <p> The second part of Gray 's theory is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larger numbers of hurricanes will form in the Atlantic out of storms that originate in the Sahel , a coastal region of west Africa . <p> Gray 's assistant Chris Landsea says a Florida State University researcher , Sharon Nicholson , has concluded from fossils in Sahel lake beds that the region has undergone cycles of rain and drought lasting several decades since ancient times . <p> Gray theorizes that the Sahel rainfall cycle is related to a cycle of slow-moving currents dubbed the " " Atlantic Ocean Thermohaline Conveyor Belt " that affect offshore water temperature . <p> As Landsea explains the " " conveyor belt , " warm equatorial water flows to the north Atlantic , sinks to lower depths and flows back toward the equator . <p> The Sahel has been a desert for about 30 years , Landsea says , but in the 1950s , when it was getting more rainfall , hurricane activity in the Atlantic was roughly double present levels . <p> Fortunately for Texas , the expected increase in hurricanes is likely to be greater on the Atlantic coast than the Gulf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Africa but roughly a third of ours form  --  like Alicia  --  in the Gulf or Caribbean . <p> A few Atlantic hurricanes also form offshore , especially in the northern waters around Bermuda , but these often do not reach the United States , Landsea said .
