<p> If anyone has reason to be grateful for the war in the Persian Gulf , it is the unfortunate White House speechwriter responsible for President Bush 's State of the Union Address this evening . Without an international crisis , what would the President have to talk about ? <p> Perhaps no Administration in this century has completed two years in office so devoid of domestic accomplishments and so uninterested in setting a domestic agenda . And there is no suggestion that anything will change soon . John Sununu captured the essence of the Administration 's emptiness recently when he answered a question about what remained on the President 's domestic agenda with a curt , " Not that much . " Were it not for Saddam Hussein , the Bush Presidency would be nearly invisible . <p> The litany of Mr. Bush 's domestic failures is already painfully familiar : the silly drumbeating for hopeless constitutional amendments , the embarrassing contortions leading up to a budget agreement that the President now claims makes him " gag , " the bold promises about education , drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan managed to antagonize black leaders as quickly as Mr. Bush has done with his clumsy veto of the 1990 Civil Rights bill and his even clumsier handling of the Education Department 's notorious directive on minority scholarships . With the nation heading into what could be a major recession and its banking and financial system on the verge of collapse , the Administration has no response other than to hope that things will get better soon . <p> What accounts for this vacuous record ? The President blames it on the Democratic Party 's control of Congress , and he is partly correct in that . Unlike Ronald Reagan , Mr. Bush inspires no fear  --  and , if the budget negotiations are any indication , some contempt  --  among Congressional Democrats , who seem eager to see him ( and his obstreperous aides ) fail . <p> But the President 's critics are also partly correct when they blame the Administration 's problems on its own conceptual emptiness . Throughout his nearly three decades in politics , Mr. Bush has been a man of highly malleable convictions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the slightest hint of a deep commitment to anything other than his own political needs . He entered office with no ideological base , no natural constituency and no discernible agenda . The Bush Administration not only lacks a domestic mission , it lacks the will to look for one . <p> But Mr. Bush 's greatest problem is precisely what got him elected in the first place : the hard-won triumph of the right within the Republican Party , a triumph achieved  --  after years of frustration  --  by the creation of what is now being trumpeted as a " new paradigm . " For 30 years after the New Deal , the Republican right struggled to halt and even reverse the growth of the Federal Government . All such efforts ended in futility . <p> Attacking Government programs directly , as right-wing Republicans from Robert Taft to Barry Goldwater discovered , does not attract majority support . Every Federal program has a political constituency . The biggest and most expensive programs have the broadest support . Voters might not like government in the abstract , but almost everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not until Howard Jarvis launched a tax revolt in 1978 with Proposition 13 in California did the right discover that there was a better way to undermine government than by assailing specific programs : It was assailing taxes . By separating the issue of taxes from the issue of what taxes supported , the right achieved the most controversial elements of its own agenda ( destroying the Government 's ability to achieve new goals ) without openly antagonizing the millions of voters who continued to expect a public response to social problems . <p> George Bush is now the unhappy legatee of this dubious victory , one he dutifully supported throughout the 1980 's but in which he himself apparently never really believed . Unlike Ronald Reagan , he is not inherently hostile to government ; on the contrary , he is its creature . <p> He speaks forlornly of social goals he would like to achieve if only there were more money , and is unable effectively to challenge the " new paradigm " of the Reagan years  --  that cutting taxes and undermining government 's ability to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feckless performance during the budget negotiations makes it clear that he has no idea how to make the case for increasing public revenues . <p> Trapped between a deteriorating social and economic climate crying out for Government intervention , and a deliberately emasculated public sector stripped of most of its traditional tools , the President is now little more than a not-very-interested observer of the course of domestic events . He has no apparent strategy and no visible ideas , only the faint echoes of stale campaign rhetoric . <p> " We have the kinder , gentler approach , " President Bush told Time magazine recently . " It is catching on . They used to laugh about the thousand points of light . There are plenty of areas of this nature that I would readily concede we have got a long way to go before we fulfill what I would like to see done in the next two years . " That is about as coherent as George Bush has ever been on the subject of domestic policy .
