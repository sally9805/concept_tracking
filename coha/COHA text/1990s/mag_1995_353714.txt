The road to parenthood is often paved with missteps and disappointments , but for parents who for one reason or another choose to adopt , it is especially perilous . Senior writer Jill Smolowe and her husband Joe Treen ( a senior editor at PEOPLE ) traveled all the way to Yangzhou , China , to find their daughter Rebecca , and there were hazards all the way : interminable waiting lists ; promising leads that fell through at the last minute ; even political turmoil . As journalists , the couple were keenly aware that international events could at any moment close a door that had taken years to pry open . Just as they were about to leave for China , Washington and Beijing began fighting over trade issues , and rumors circulated that Deng Xiaoping , China 's aging leader , was about to die  --  an event that could presage turmoil . <P> But all the travails  --  and the travels  --  were forgotten the moment they had Rebecca in their arms . " When the woman from the orphanage handed her over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never looked back . " <P> Rebecca , now 14 months , was constantly on Smolowe 's mind as she wrote this week 's story about the controversy surrounding " transracial " adoptions . " As I read about people who champion the idea that it would be better for children to languish in temporary foster homes than be adopted into families of another race , " says Smolowe , " I had to work hard to separate the reporting from my feelings . " Senior editor Lee Aitken , whose daughter Sophie , 4 , was adopted in Bulgaria , argues that in stories like this , firsthand experience can make for better journalism . " At some point , the adoption ordeal always brings you face-to-face with your most basic values , " says Aitken . " You have to be very honest with yourself , and Jill knew that instinctively . " <P> Jill and Joe 's Rebecca now lives in a room decorated with mementos from China ( " We want her to be acquainted with the culture of her native country , " says her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own bed  --  a crib the size of the one she shared with two other babies in that Chinese orphanage . " For the first few weeks after we brought her home , Rebecca would open her eyes , gaze at me and simply beam , surprised and delighted , looking as if she wanted to say , ' Oh , you 're still there , ' " Smolowe says . " There are people who say to us , ' Rebecca 's such a lucky little girl . ' Those people do n't understand . Joe and I are the lucky ones . "
