It was the long bad time after the long good time . <p> Stocks a puzzle , real estate stalled , the bond market iffy , Wall Street firms down to half their size Two of his former associates under indictment : Sorkin and Menninger , Menninger probably guilty . To Lee Binstock , good times had always come like sunshine on a holiday weekend ; a feeling of surprise but of pleasure deserved . Now , out of work for the first time in twenty years , bad times came with the unpleasant surprise of being caught and punished in spite of feeling innocent . And , of course , there was the matter of Binstock 's mouth . <p> Always , he 'd been able to make his own extracurricular comfort : the clarinet 's woody breath of independence  --  his horn of romance . He had partners in crime . Callahan , advertising copy , ruddy , volatile on the violin , with his quiet academic wife , second fiddle in more ways than one ; Menninger , mutual funds , intense , humorless on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the pulse on cello . No " civilian , " as they called those who could only listen , could know what a Sunday afternoon spent summoning the Brahms quintet could do  --  a single-minded song to ransom the frustrations of buying too much and selling too little , to pardon the mistakes of the week , the wrong choices of a lifetime . <p> You can see why , once it was clear that he could not make a clean , steady sound on the clarinet anymore , might never again , Binstock was thrown into despair . He had actually  --  at rock bottom one night  --  called a suicide hot line advertised in the Village Voice . The woman on the phone had answered : " Suicide hot line  --  please hold . " And then clicked him off onto recorded music for waiting . By the time seven minutes had gone by , the idea of being put on hold to wait for a suicide counselor seemed so absurd that his mood began to clear . Also , the music they played was a Marcello oboe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made plans to buy the recording as soon as he could get to Tower Records  --  which he supposed was the same as saying he 'd decided to live and had not been really serious about dying . <p> Nevertheless , the misery returned the next day , apparently to stay . Binstock supposed he should be grateful that he never had to play for a living . But it did n't help when Eugenia suggested he try to switch over to the piano since after the bloody fight the clarinet seem to be finished for him . <p> " It 's nothing you did , Lee , " she said . " Do n't forget that . Those guys in the car  --  they did something to you . " <p> " I could have kept my mouth shut , " Binstock said . " I might not have a job but at least I 'd still have a mouth . " <p> She kissed him quickly on that cue . His lips were askew since the surgery  --  hence the difficulty in forming a proper embouchure and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still taste a kiss . It tasted cool and sweet  --  a hint of some cherry-like lipstick flavor . <p> " Where the hell do you think you 're going ? " <p> " Move your ass . I 've got the light . " <p> " And I 've got the right of way . " <p> " Hey , we got a walking lawyer here . Right of way ... " <p> " I just meant that you 're such a good musician you should n't waste it . It 's always been more than a hobby to you . You were never just a businessman . " <p> " Disgusting word . " <p> " Which ? Musician ? Businessman  --  ? " <p> " Hobby . What a word to use about music . " <p> " I knew you 'd say that . " <p> " We 've been married too long . You know everything I 'm going to say  --  " <p> " Married talk is like music .

" <p> " Think about trying the piano . We 'll always keep body and soul together . But you have to care for your soul . L.A. did n't help with that either . " <p> When the market had collapsed , when the open possibilities of the last few years all seemed to turn into dead ends , Binstock had taken them to California . Eugenia , New York to her bones as only an out-of-towner can be  --  Connecticut born  --  objected to the choice of L.A. But Binstock was in need of hope and hid behind a joke , somebody 's remark that Hollywood was the only place in the world where you could die from encouragement . That was the one commodity he needed , he told her , after most of the other commodities in his world had failed him . They escaped to the Beverly Hills branch of Dean Witter , in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on either coast . She ran a newsletter for educators from home ... wrote , edited , mailed  --  the works . " I 'm pre-Industrial Revolution , " went her running joke . " The last cottage industry . " This made for laughter at parties but said nothing about younger ambitions , about newspaper jobs not landed , about magazines not created . The newsletter won journalism awards . It provided a modest income and it could be moved with the luggage . They waited a few weeks because the gynecologist thought Eugenia might be pregnant , but it was another false alarm . <p> In Los Angeles they economized : one car for the two of them . On weekends , Eugenia out playing women 's doubles , Binstock took a small , aristocratic pleasure in noting how cars slowed down for you when you walked across Santa Monica Boulevard , a rare West Coast bid , a pedestrian . Even so Los Angeles gave little comfort , less encouragement . They were back in New York in seven months . <p> " If you 're such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Just move , buster . I get out of this car you 're going to be damned sorry ... " <p> Then the comedy of errors on upper Broadway , a car pressing him to move as he crossed Eighty-sixth Street , an angry Bin . stock deciding to move at his own pace , even not to move at all  --  then the fistfight , the only such encounter in Binstock 's adult years , crunched bone , spitting , choking on blood filling his mouth with the taste of pennies , Binstock dizzy on his knees , the police siren singing in his ears . <p> " Son of a bitch did n't even stick around . Broke my mouth and beat it . " <p> That was what he 'd tried to say , but it did n't come out clear enough for the cops or Eugenia to understand . He said it to her , carefully , after the operation . <p> " Blame it on L.A. , " Eugenia said . " The cars there slow down when they 're a mile away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot how they drive in New York . " <p> Binstock murmured , stiff-mouthed , " I was born a pedestrian . When this bastard started to push me with his damn BMW I just got pissed off . I was too tired of being pushed . " <p> " Because he was pushing you  --  or because it was a BMW ? " They 'd sold their 's the year after the big slowdown when they sold the house in East Hampton . They were city mice again ; reacquainted with the IRT , the crosstown bus . <p> Back from the hospital , too weak to look for the next job , he looked over the mail one day , sitting on the bed , only to find a disturbing letter from Sorkin in the mail . It was a rambling note full of regrets , I guess I did wrong things but , in some strange way , not bad things . I do n't know ... I should have known better ... do n't care about myself ... ashamed to face Ruthie and David  --  I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Carl Sandburg . You should read it  --  we should all read it ... " <p> These days , post-operation , Binstock was exhausted by mid-day , and it was 2:00 PM . He fell asleep lying on top of the covers , right where he was . The instant his eyes were closed he thought  --  the letter from Sorkin sounded like a suicide note . He 'd never seen one but the notion troubled him . He would call as soon as he woke up to see how the poor bastard was doing . But it was the phone call from Sorkin 's son , David , that woke him an hour later . <p> The funeral service was mercifully brief though Riverside Memorial Chapel was crowded . The rabbi made no mention of suicide , speaking only , a little tactlessly Binstock thought , of temptations and sin . Binstock did not linger . The letter in his pocket was on fire  --  and the only way to put it out was to find out what Sorkin had meant about the Sandburg poem . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look what had happened to Hamlet . The trouble was , Binstock had a pretty decent library but Sandburg was not a writer he 'd ever cared enough about to keep . So the poem would have to be searched out . <p> Before he could find a bookstore he actually passed a public library . There was something about a public library in the middle of the afternoon that mingled convalescence with the flavor of childhood . The library was half empty , but he remembered the libraries of the past exactly that way . The computer showed all of Sandburg , but there was nothing called " The Oven Bird . " <p> Binstock found it hard to believe that Sorkin , hard-nosed , sharp-edged Sorkin , had actually read poetry . The one person in their group who busied herself with poetry readings downtown , maybe even wrote a few poems , had fallen out of touch as soon as the going got tough : Jennie Maslow . It was worth a shot , a quarter from a phone booth on the corner . <p> " Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carlyle was blindingly dark after the cold autumn sunlight , and Binstock blinked and blinked until he saw her . He said : " I ca n't believe I called you out of the blue and there you were . " <p> It 's hard to know who was more nervous , Binstock or this slender , almost anorexic-looking young woman  --  younger than he remembered . <p> " It just means I 'm one of those people at home during the day . But calling about a poem ! Who 's going to believe that ! " <p> When he told her about Sorkin 's letter she believed it . " The tough ones melt down the quickest . I read the obit this morning , but I could n't get myself to go . " <p> The drinks came , a Coke for him and the real thing , something with tequila , for Jennie . " Not settled anywhere yet ? " he asked . <p> " Ah , well , " she said . " I had a good long tide . I put some cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still having those wonderful chamber music evenings of yours ? The Mozart Quintet ... " <p> It was the time to tell her about the fight and the operation and to show her his mouth a little more closely . He was grateful now that the bars in the afternoon were dark . <p> She braved it out . " I have n't been this close to your mouth in years . Kind of nice . " <p> Jennie had happened just before he 'd met Eugenia , and Binstock had been the one to break it off . That 's why he 'd been too embarrassed to just ask her for information about a poem on the phone , why he 'd suggested a drink when it was much too early for a drink and much too late for Jennie . When it was clear he was not picking up on her auld lang syne she said , " I 'm sorry those bastards hurt you and I 'm sorry about the clarinet . I know how much you loved playing . I found out in high school that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn . At least you can play . " <p> " Could , " he said . " You probably know this poem Sorkin wanted me to read . " <p> She giggled , a nervous tic more than laughter . " The answer from the grave ? " <p> " Or a warning . " <p> " Sorkin was wrong . ' The Oven Bird ' is n't Sandburg . Can you imagine your cold-blooded partner turning away from his computer running the price of gold in Tokyo and reading a poem to try to understand his life ? He even got the poet wrong . My God ! I mean , I 'm sorry about what happened but Jesus  --  Sorkin , of all people . " <p> " No soul ? " <p> " Whatever passes for that these days  --  yeah , that 's what I meant . But it 's not Sandburg . " She laughed . " The bird is way beyond old Carl Sandburg  --  Chicago , Hog Butcher to the world , et cetera . You know , Frost is really a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the darker ones . " <p> " Let 's hear it . " Binstock sipped his Coke carefully . He was using his mouth very carefully these days . <p> " Oh , I do n't know it by heart . " She raised her glass . A few seconds wait and she said , " I live around the corner on Eighty-fourth Street . " <p> " I know , " Binstock said . <p> " Come on back and I 'll dig it out . " <p> She read quite beautifully , a low husky voice without sentimental cadences , just right for this strange little item . He sipped a vodka  --  it was now late enough for a drink  --  and listened . Jennie said it was a sonnet , surprising him . Binstock did n't think people wrote sonnets after Shakespeare . It began : <p> There is a ringer everyone has heard , Loud , a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird . <p> It was not difficult , just had to focus on  --  what the hell could Sorkin have had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was painful , it was clear . <p> The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing . <p> Jenny put the book down . " Poor bastard , " she said . <p> " I liked him , " Binstock said . " But I never quite trusted him . What kind of a man goes into arbitrage ? After playing the viola in high school . Buying and selling money . Weird . " <p> " You sound like Ezra Pound . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " It does n't matter , " Jenny said . " Look at these lines  --  this was his mood when he  --  " She read : <p> The bird would cease and be as other birds But that he knows in singing not to sing . The question that he frames in all but words ... <p> Binstock murmured the last line : ' Is what to make of a diminished thing . ' Jesus , you know I could have done without this . Some favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead leaned over him , the book in her hand " I remember when I first read it . It makes your insides jump . Each time . It 's always a shock . The question is when you read it . At what point . Sometimes you find those lines when you 're ready for them . Other times they jump at you  --  a sad surprise . " <p> " I guess Sorkin was looking for answers  --  and he found this . " <p> " Found another question . " <p> She traced his wounded mouth with a temporary caress . The kiss surprised them both . Not knowing what to do when their mouths separated she dropped the book into his hands . " Here , " she said . " Take it . You can return it when you 're done . " <p> Binstock was torn  --  borrowed books had to be returned  --  usually in person . Her finger touched the scar above his lip . <p> " Is this where  --  ? " <p> Binstock stood up . What he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not her book , not anything . Anyway , now the poem was his as much as hers  --  a dubious acquisition . <p> Back at his apartment , Eugenia was still out . The books on the shelves were waiting . But by this time Binstock was in a fuming rage . What was this shit about a poem that Sorkin was trying to pull on him ? Was he implying that the two of them had been in the same boat , the same bag , the same scam , choose any crummy metaphor you want , he thought , running his fingers along the spines of books . He 'd been such an idiot that between Sorkin and Menninger , he 'd always assumed that maybe it was Menninger who deserved the indictment  --  had done something tricky , just beyond the law in some gay area of right and wrong . <p> Menninger had such a smooth style , while Sorkin was all sincerity . Mister Straight in his collection of tattersall vests , the country boy come to Wall Street who just got lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck  --  finished . Was this poem by another country boy written in some code Binstock was supposed to break , a code that would reveal the truth of what had happened to all of them and all the others who 'd been laid low after riding so high ? <p> The problem was , Binstock did n't feel he belonged with the others . He 'd been like the child at the grown-ups ' party , only half understanding what they were talking about when their lunch deals got cryptic , mysterious . Maybe a broker who played the serious musician on weekends was not to be trusted with secrets full of dirt and danger . In which case his clarinet may have saved his ass . Who knows what he would have done given the opportunity . In any case , he was n't knocking himself off . For Christ 's sake , he was n't forty yet  --  why should he read a fucking poem about diminished things ? <p> Binstock pulled the book out so violently that a batch of neighboring books tumbled to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the blue-covered Frost book and tried to tear it in half . He 'd never imagined what it might feel like to try to rip up a hardcover book , but he was sue it would be easy . It was n't . The top part detached from the spine , pages ripped and dangling , but the whole thing stopped around halfway . His right hand hurt , and he felt like an idiot . He stood there , wondering how he would explain this scene if Eugenia walked in at that moment . <p> The ragged Frost was on the floor next to his foot as he kneeled , trying to pick up the books in time , but of course Eugenia arrived in the middle of it all . <p> " What 's going on ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Binstock said . <p> She zeroed in on the ripped-up Frost before he had a chance to hide it . <p> " My God , what is this ? " She picked it up . It dangled from her hand , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not even yours . It belonged to Richard . " <p> " I did n't think of that . " <p> " Maybe you did . Are you still weird about him ? " <p> Richard was Eugenia 's first husband , an architect , first divorced , now dead in a plane crash three years ago . <p> " I was never weird about Richard . " <p> " You acted like a crazy person whenever I mentioned him . " <p> " Maybe you did that a little too often . " <p> " Oh , for God 's sake , Lee . " <p> " Anyway , this is about Sorkin , my ex-partner , not your ex-husband . " <p> She pushed her coat off her shoulders and let it fall among the books . <p> " I forgot about him mentioning some poem . Is this it ? I thought it was Sandburg . " <p> " It was Frost . Sorkin did n't know anything about poetry . Neither do I. But I do n't go around writing letters scaring people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Did that scare you ? " <p> " Well , it freaked me . " <p> She carried the torn and flapping book into the living room . Binstock did not follow her . He knelt among the books and started replacing them on the shelves . Then he hung up Eugenia 's coat . When he was finished he went into the living room . He lay down on the couch and picked up yesterday 's Wall Street Journal , half-scanning it , half-hiding behind it . <p> She was quite a long time . He heard her exhale , a long slow breath . <p> Binstock has been hoping she would get to the lines in question and just read them in some cool and detached grown-up Eugenia way . Instead she seems taken out of herself . <p> " Diminished thing ,  --  " she breathes . " How did he know ? " <p> Binstock puts down the paper . Eugenia is leaning back , her finger marking the last two lines of the poem . He asks her what she means  --  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reasonably happy , lucky , but if you think about diminished things , how could she not count up all the times , the lessening , the shrinking , the losing ... " My God , " she murmurs ? <p> " What do you mean , exactly ? " he asks , all innocence . " Be specific . " <p> " It 's not just now  --  early middle or whatever I 'm in . It 's every time . When I was fourteen I thought I would never again feel the heights of the year before when these two seniors , Larry and Bart competed for me  --  and I ignored them both and wrote an essay on independence for a school contest that got published in the Atlantic Monthly , special teenagers ' section . And do you remember , when you fist met me , how I played tennis with a natural backhand motion out of Balanchine . Now , I have to think carefully , Get the racket back , bend your knees ... diminished things ... " She gently folds the torn book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd taken the whole question from him and made it her own , had gone from surprised anger to introspection so quickly . All it took was a few lines of a poem . At the same time , she took the idea of diminishment so lightly  --  just a minor joke played on us all ... took the Oven Bird 's song down to questions of a fourteen year old 's essay ... of a tennis backhand . <p> " Let 's eat out tonight , " he said . <p> " I have veal defrosting . " <p> Eugenia had been cooking home every night for months , avoiding the hefty restaurant checks of the good old days . <p> " If I 'm tearing up books you can melt some veal . " <p> She left the Frost on the couch , looking like the survivor of some natural disaster , helpless , open to the Oven Bird 's page . <p> They picked an Italian place which was on a special discount card : 20% off everything : tax and tip included . Binstock ordered a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A double ? " Eugenia used her eyebrows . <p> " Not to worry . Twenty percent off . " <p> They both knew she had n't meant the money but she let it pass . <p> " Did Richard really like poetry a lot ? " <p> " Are we back to Richard ? " <p> Eugenia ordered a glass of the house red while Binstock worked a little too swiftly on his double vodka . It was not Elio 's , it was not Primola , it was certainly not 21 , though the tables had white tablecloths , not checkered cloth or paper  --  they were n't down to that yet . But there was little likelihood of running into anybody they knew . They were between lives . Old friends still ate and summered in places they would not now be able to afford . New friends are not made so easily after thirty-five . Once , at two in the morning , Eugenia had wakened and murmured to him something about depending too much on each other . Binstock had said , " Who 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . <p> " Actually , " she said , " Richard was more visual . He liked some poetry but nothing too complicated . And God knows he was n't the kind who would try to find some truth about himself from a poem . Have we now maybe had enough about Richard and have you maybe had enough Vodka ? " <p> His hand had been in the air to catch the waiter 's eye while she was talking . But by this time the waiter was there and he was ordering another double Gibson ; Eugenia was carefully reading her way through the pastas . When he 'd gotten irritated enough at her silent menu-reading act , Binstock tossed back about half of his second drink in one gulp . A dramatic toss , the way he 'd seen actors do it in the movies . <p> But the drama backfired . The vodka went down the wrong way and he could n't bring up a breath . Eugenia heard the awful wheeze and screech of his trying to breathe and she stood up . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't answer , just kept trying to pull air up , desperately hoping that the block would give . He felt an instant away from being able to breathe again and at the same time an instant away from dying . He was terrified . It went on longer than he could have believed . He did n't think you could do without air for that long . People at the next table stared . The waiter appeared . <p> " Are you all right , sir ? " <p> Eugenia came up from behind and grabbed him , pulling him up from his chair . She put her arms around his chest in some amateur 's version of the rescue techniques they 'd seen demonstrated on television . Then she squeezed hard . Binstock did n't want her to do that . He screeched even worse but felt a bit of air get through . Then , suddenly it was over . He could get a half breath in , then finally a sort of regular flow of air began . <p> All he could say was , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binstock had never drunk so much so quickly and Eugenia had to put him to bed . But the alcohol made him edgy , alert even as it wore off . When Eugenia went to the kitchen to make coffee he sneaked into the bathroom and took a Valium  --  sneaked it because they both knew you did n't mix Valium and liquor . But when she came back with the coffee he told her ; she just laughed and poured the coffee . " It 's been that kind of day , " she said . " Tearing up books , vodka , Valium , almost choking to death . Not necessarily in that order . " <p> Sipping , sitting up , he said , " Maybe I was still competing with Sorkin . " <p> " I do n't think choking to death is highly recommended for suicide . Too painful , too unsure . " <p> " It felt pretty close to dying  --  it feels that way when you ca n't breathe for so long . " <p> " We keep talking about taking a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the tray and lay back . " I feel like Lazarus back from the dead . " <p> " How does it feel ? " <p> " Strange . More peaceful than I 've been for days , maybe weeks or months . " <p> Eugenia picked up the tray to take it back to the kitchen . Binstock saw that her hands were trembling . He let her go without saying anything ; he felt tranquil  --  too quick for the Valium  --  as if he 'd come out on the other side of something . She came back to see him off to sleep and he was too sleepy now to notice if her hands were still shaky . <p> " Are you all right , Lee ? " <p> " Yes . I 'll get another job , a good one . Not to worry . " <p> " You scared me to death when you could n't breathe . " <p> " Almost . " <p> " Well , almost to death . " <p> " I felt pretty close myself . No air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blankets with quick nervous movements and sat down on the bed . <p> " Will you be able to sleep ? " <p> He was almost asleep already , he told her and , after all , he still had a mouth  --  to smile with , to kiss with , to eat with . Maybe a little more cautiously than before . Had he told her , he asked , with the odd solemnity of receding drunkenness , that he 'd spent his childhood waiting in asthma clinics with his mother , that he 'd desperately wanted to play the cello but they 'd given him the clarinet instead because the doctor thought it would be good for his poor , constricted , twitchy lungs ? " <p> " No. " she said . " Did it work ? " <p> " Yes . It worked , a lot of things work until they do n't anymore . " <p> Eugenia folded blankets around him and said , " It 's just an idea to you  --  a poem  --  but I 've seen Oven Bids . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the farm in Haddam before my grandfather sold it . A brown back with white across the breast .

" If it 's a teacher we can ask it what all this means , what 's happened to us . " <p> " Maybe it does n't know , maybe it 's only calling for its teacher . And besides , it 's a bird that does n't answer questions  --  only asks  --  and only asks one question , according to the poem ... ' What to make of  --  ' " <p> " Yes . " <p> He murmured , " I wonder , did Sorkin 's suicide note do this to us , tonight , or was it Mister Frost 's bird ? " He began to drift off even though he wanted to stay and be of some comfort to her as she had been to him , but he was too far gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided but not the drowsiness . <p> Drifting into sleep Binstock thinks about his mother , standing in line at the clinic , holding the card with the visits checked off  --  her calm manner hiding the nervous chain-smoker , the courageous woman afraid of everything , supervising his prescribed home exercises : breathe in deeply , breathe out even more deeply , empty your lungs  --  push . His mother who 'd always made do with so little , asked even less , but had been granted at least the largesse of height  --  a statuesque , lofty carriage . And Binstock remembers how even that had diminished at the last , and she cast a short , sickly shadow on the way out . <p> Binstock wakes in a sudden state of joy . It is almost morning going by the light seeping in at the corners of the shutters . His mouth is dry and his head hurts but he has the answer . With the foolish clarity of dreams it presents itself as a sublimely simple solution : sell the clarinet .

Once it is out of the house Binstock can start again  --  find new opportunities , new consolations . He wonders how much you could get for a used Buffet B-flat clarinet in good condition . Quietly , Binstock steps out of bed , past his sleeping wife , out of the bedroom . <p> He unhooks the case and holds up the instrument . The silver keys glimmer in a strobe of light as he turns it in his hands , the black wood gleaming the only way wood knows how to gleam when competing with silver , but lovely in its own dark ways . If he kept it , it would not be like other clarinets , would never again sing the Brahms or the Mozart ... <p> He hears the echo of the lines and goes into the living room where the ripped Frost book is still lying on the couch . He finds : <p> The bird would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in singing not to sing . <p> His eyes roam the page looking for other lines that had pissed him off in yesterday 's state of rage  --  confusing him but not consoling . It is different this morning . In the kitchen , holding the book , Binstock pours himself a glass of orange juice , comes back to the couch and reads the fourteen lines . Then he gets a white-lined pad from his desk , takes out the Montblanc fountain pen Eugenia had bought him when they 'd first made him a vice-president at Merrill Lynch . He begins to copy out the sonnet . It is comforting to roll out the words ; he understands why people in mourning go back to school so often . <p> Binstock thinks  --  this is not such a big deal . It 's as if he 'd spent his life reading and understanding poems . <p> There is a singer everyone has heard , Loud , a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird , Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again . <p> pause to reread . Mid-summer is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-summer is already too late , the peak is over . God !

It is as if he 's just created it instead of simply copying it out to get it straight in his head . Everybody seemed to be writing this poem , singing this song these days . He remembered Tarloff , the company 's third president in two years , taking him to lunch to say good-bye . <p> " It 's not just that we 're facing hard times here at the firm or even here in America . " <p> " No ? " <p> " We 're looking at a worldwide diminution of assets . " Tarloff 's gnarled hands shaped  --  what ? An apple ? A melon ? <p> " Just imagine , Lee , that this whole globe we live on was of a certain diameter , worth a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer could even figure it out . And now , it 's just  --  shrunk . " His hands collapsed to a smaller apple or melon . " The value of the whole world as we know it . Permanently . It was worth X in total . Now it 's worth V. Simple as that . " <p> Binstock had not asked if that was why they 'd had to let him go . It was a lofty reason , very classy ; but he was afraid it might come down to something hot quite so elegant . It was perhaps not that the dollar value of the planet earth had shrunk ; more like the fact it was November , his end of the year bonus would have been substantial and Tarloff needed every penny to keep the place afloat . Of because he had worked closely with Sorkin and was afraid Binstock might be implicated in that mess . The firm did n't need one more arrest on the business pages of The New York Times . But instead of asking he 'd just laughed nervously . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying and Binstock had said oh , yes , he understood it quite well . <p> He walked back to the bedroom to the edge of the bed . Eugenia slept , lightly snoring , her sweet mouth pushed open and closed by the push and pull of breathe . Binstock stood by the bed waiting , watching her breathe , anxious and grateful . When she woke he would tell her , " I saw Jenny Maslow this afternoon . I tried to find the poem in the library and I could n't . Sorkin mixed up Sandburg and Frost and I figured Jenny would know . " <p> She would say , " Oh ? " , noncommittal as usual in these matters . He was the one who was jealous of ex-husbands , ex-lovers . Eugenia lacked the jealous gene . For her love and sex were one and entirely in the present . <p> He remembered their first sexual play , one , two , three times until one night she asked , why always three , one good is better than three any which way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth which could play the games it wished  --  could push to the edge , foolish bravado or not . <p> Gone now was their Italian driving all night on impulse in the warm rain , stopping in a hilltop town at midnight , the piazzas mysterious in the moonlight , the ubiquitous cats lurking around silent fountains , the pensiones all full or shut , the first one no , the second one no , the third pensiones seedy but offering a room , the walls damp , the bed not made up , one towel for both of them , too exhausted for anything more interesting than sleep but holding each other anyway , almost too tired to make love so love made them , falling asleep on scratchy sheets the instant after . Late , of course , came the careful planning of travel , the well-planned reservations with the precisely specified rooms . <p> Eugenia tolled to her side ; her eyelids fluttered . When she saw him standing there she called out his name . Binstock sat down next to her . Eugenia laid her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't know what to do except hold her and stupidly say , " What is it , what is it ? " <p> She spoke between sobs as children do , hard to hear at first , almost a whisper , then louder and louder . " I thought there would be more time ... I thought we would have a child , maybe two by now ... I wanted to start a real magazine one day ... Partisan Review , Vanity Fair I do n't know what but not just a newletter that tells everybody  --  stuff ... I majored in literature not journalism ... When my sister died so young I knew I would always feel less than before ... everything is less than before ... we make love less ... we probably waited too long to start children and now maybe we ca n't ... " <p> She lifted her head from his chest , blinking at Binstock . <p> " Do you know , " she said , " I had to start holding my head at a funny angle because I could n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I was only fourteen ? I did n't tell you when we got married because I was ashamed to be losing such serious things still so young . I do n't know which is a worse diminished thing  --  the body or the way the mind dreams and then gives up dreaming . For God 's sake I 'm thirty-eight . Is n't that too young for all this ? " <p> She sobbed lightly , exhausted by her own emotions . <p> " I knew about that , " he lied . " I just ignored it . " <p> Binstock forgot about telling her he 'd seen Jenny , forgot about selling the clarinet , a dumb idea whose joy was just as dumb , just as temporary . Instead he held Eugenia tightly , miserable at hearing so many unspoken regrets . <p> After a few moments he got up and went to the end table and got the round metal ashtray which had not been used since he 'd given up cigars two years ago  --  now as useless an object as his clarinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd written the Frost poem and found his old lighter in a bureau drawer . It was mysterious , a morning flame inside their bedroom . Eugenia pulled herself up on one elbow and watched the poem burn into black and white and then into crumbs of black . <p> She murmured , " What are you doing ? " <p> When he told her , she nodded . Binstock watched her watching the embers . It was as if his wife had been his partner in writing the poem down in order to figure out what to make of it , as if copying and then burning poems was an ordinary event . She 'd woken up , weeping variations on the same theme . The Oven Bird was a tough teacher . Sorkin had learned the hard way . Now it was their turn . Subtraction was the law and the sentence . Everything else was just a plea bargain . <p> Afterwards , Binstock was starved , the way you are sometimes after a funeral or after making love . He and Eugenia covered the kitchen table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a feast . <p> " You know , " she said , trying not to spill her coffee , her mouth full of sweet strawberry jam . " The important part , the part we sort of missed , is ' what to make of a diminished thing . ' The ball , as we say when we play tennis , is in our court . " <p> " Yes , " Binstock said . " That 's what the bird wants you to think . " <p>
