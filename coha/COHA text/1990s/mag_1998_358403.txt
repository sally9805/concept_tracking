In the biographical notes on the back of advance copies of her forthcoming album , Remember to Breathe ( Elektra ) , singer-songwriter Rebekah , 25 , professes her love for such varied musical artists as James Taylor , Garbage , and Earth , Wind &; Fire . At a recent performance at the Mercury Lounge , a music club in New York City 's East Village , her diverse musical tastes were on full display . She charged through a pop-rock composition she co-wrote titled Sin So Well , and she romped through an R.-and-B. - flavored cover of the Rolling Stones ' Get Off of My Cloud . Afterward , she quieted the crowd and sang another original , the introspective ballad Little Black Girl . " It 's a minor miracle just to make it to your graduation/when nowhere in your world is there a hint of validation , " she sang . " This is not political , it 's personal . " She told the audience that the song , of all the ones on her album , was her favorite . <P> Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create rock ' n ' roll as it is today . Indeed , Aretha Franklin was the first female inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Even so , black female rockers are n't a common sight on MTV , and they were n't a common sight at last summer 's Lilith Fair . However , several new artists are hoping to change all that . Remember to Breathe is a startlingly accomplished debut , full of spirit and smarts . And British singer-guitarist Billie Myers ' recently released debut , Growing , Pains ( Universal ) , is steadily climbing the Billboard charts ; one song from the album , Kiss the Rain , has become a Top-20 single . Both of these artists make rock that draws on soul and folk , yet they each have a distinct style . But one thing they have in common : both have made uncommonly good albums . <P> Remember to Breathe deserves to cause a sensation . " On my record is everything I listen to , " the Cleveland native says , " from a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and R. and B. If I listened to polka , it would be on the record too . " And the mix works . Her rock numbers , like the aching Keep It a Secret and the joyful Love Trap , have edge , and they have soul . At her best , she 's a bit like Juliana Hatfield with a small injection of Des'ree . <P> Albums that straddle the line between rock and R. and B. sometimes fall into the cracks . But Rebekah says that possibility never entered her mind . " I do n't think about , ' Oh , are black people going to listen to this ? Are white people ? ' " she says . " I do what I do . I know who I am . I 'm not trying to be someone I 'm not . As long as I 'm honest , hopefully it will find a market where someone will say , ' Oh , she 's just being herself . ' " <P> Like Rebekah , Billie Myers has wide-ranging musical tastes . " I listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Deana Carter . Alana Davis . Radiohead . " Her album is filled with moderately paced , big-hearted rock . Myers has a strong , sure sense of melody , and most of her songs make a strong impression even after just the first hearing . The chorus of the lilting A Few Words Too Many dances along , gracefully pulling the listener in . The stomping Tell Me has an Indian flavor spiced with a flute and a sitar . One of the best songs , You Send Me Flying , with its acoustic guitar intro , is almost a country number . Myers ' sweet , mournful alto holds everything together .
