Forget all this stuff about global telephone wars , deregulation and anticompetitiveness . Policy wonks can ponder such issues all they want in view of the possible $50 billion merger of long-distance king AT &T; with regional phone operator SBC Communications . Investors need consider only one thing to conclude that the deal is a loser : break-ups almost always are more valuable than megamergers , and AT &T's; own history provides a storehouse of evidence . That this deal is even on the drawing board is more confounding than Dennis Rodman . <P> Recall that the old AT &T,; the regulated monopoly known as Ma Bell , was busted into eight pieces in 1984 . AT &T; was granted the long-distance franchise , and seven Baby Bells were created to run local phone services around the country . Weakening Ma Bell 's muscle made it possible for others to build competing services . But it left some 3 million AT &T; shareholders vulnerable . Suddenly gone was a quintessential widow 's and orphan 's stock . In its place was a smattering of shares of eight different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised upheaval and risk , not safety . The bust-up , though , has proved a resounding success for investors who simply did nothing . One hundred shares of AT &T; the day before the court-ordered break-up was worth $6,052 . Anyone who held on to those shares , along with all the new Baby Bell shares and their spin-offs , and reinvested all dividends would today own shares in 11 companies and have a package worth $58,396 , according to a study by the brokerage Edward D. Jones . That amounts to an average annual gain of 18.4% , vs. 16.3% for the Standard &; Poor 's 500 in the same period . Few professional money managers have done so well . <P> The success of Ma Bell 's progeny is no accident . A Penn State study found that the stocks of 161 spin-off companies between 1965 and 1990 , on average , rose 76% , vs. a market average of only 43% , over three years . Why ? Often spin-off companies become more focused , and because they are smaller they tend to have greater ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant mergers create great wealth for shareholders . Just ask AT &T.; It paid $7.4 billion for NCR Computer in 1991 and soon gave up on the acquisition , spinning it off to shareholders as part of another split , this one three ways , last year . So now somebody wants to put Ma Bell back together , replacing fruitful spin-offs with questionable mergers . That is what this deal  --  twice the size of any previous merger  --  is all about . SBC is the old Baby Bell Southwestern Bell plus the Baby Bell it recently acquired , Pacific Telesis . If the deal goes through , AT &T; will have gathered two erstwhile independent carriers back into its fold . It 's a short step from there to continue to buy . Might it be a good thing ? Well , maybe . Global competition is a reality . It may just be that one huge American phone company is what it will take to match wits with British Telecom and Nippon Telephone in the year 2525 , if man is still alive . SBC brings proven phone-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . What we know for sure , though , is that in the ' 90s every Baby Bell stock has outperformed AT &T.; I 'll take spin-offs over spin any day . <P> Daniel Kadlec is TIME 's Wall Street columnist .
