The .260 Remington makes a strong bid for the title , according to our shooting expert-who also had a hand in its creation // The newly announced .260 Remington may very well be the best deer cartridge you 'll ever take hunting . Yes , I know . This is a mighty pompous statement and deserves some skepticism . After all , the .260 is brand-new and has scarcely been to the woods . So what makes me think it 's so good ? The fact of the matter is that the .260 falls from the family tree of two of the most tested and proven cartridges the hunting world has ever known , the 6.5x54 Mannlicher-Schoenauer and the 6.5x55 Swedish . The .260 could be called their ballistic brother ... except it 's even better . A few years back I was asked to name my favorite whitetail rifle and cartridge " Top Guns , " September 1993 . After thinking it over a few moments , I picked the quick and stylish Mannlicher carbine , but I specified that it be chambered for the 6.5x54 M-S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about the same as kneeling on the ledge of a skyscraper , with your head on a chopping block , and dousing yourself with gasoline . Someone is bound to push , chop or strike a match . My number-one choice was all the more inflammatory because the 6.5x54 is of decidedly nonAmerican origin , and ever since Natty Bumppo squinted down the barrel of his long rifle , American hunters-and writers-have doted on all-American cartridges for hunting deer . Hunters were shocked that I would reach back nearly a century ( the 6.5x54 was born in 1900 ) to single out a round that is by all appearances the ballistic equivalent of a 97-pound weakling . What gave me the gall to name this runty centenarian the best of the best ? Actually the choice was an easy one when you consider the three criteria I use to define a great hunting round : shootability , behavior and impact . Shootability You 've noticed , or read , that certain cartridges kill game far more efficiently than their appearance would indicate . Just one example : The .250 Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it holds a reputation as one of the all-time great deer calibers and has earned a faithful following that swears there is some sort of magic in the bullet . The magic is in the shootability of the .250 Savage , making hunters better marksmen than they would be with larger , harder-kicking calibers . Shootability means hitting the target where it does the most good-killing game swiftly and cleanly . The little 6.5x54 M-S is one of the most shootable cartridges ever , the proof being that it now has made four appreciative generations of hunters better marksmen than they could ever have been with more intimidating calibers . Loaded with 140-grain bullets to a modest 2,500 fps muzzle velocity , the recoil of the 6.5x54 is only about 10.5 foot pounds in a seven-pound rifle ( a bit more than a .243 and less than the .30/30 ) . Which is why it has excelled when used in light , fast-handling rifles . Behavior The next test of a hunting cartridge is how the bullet behaves on its way to the target . This is an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premium on maximum velocity and make such rounds as the 6.5x54 look hopelessly old-fashioned in comparison . Using only fps data to make judgments about a cartridge 's performance can be a lot like putting your money on a horse that looks great bursting out of the gate but stumbles in the first turn . // IDEAL MARRIAGE : Initially the .260 will be offered in Remington 's Model Seven rifle . The .260 cartridge ( inset ) is flanked by the 6.5x54 M-S ( left ) and the 6.5x55 Swedish ( a .30/06 is at far right for comparison ) . // Though the velocities of the 6.5x54 M-S and its soul mate , the 6.5x55 Swedish , seem unimpressive in the company of youthful hotshots , we must not lose sight of the fact that these cartridges have been traditionally loaded with bullets that are unusually heavy in relation to their small diameter ( .26 caliber ) . If you feel the need to impress your pals with fancy ballistic lingo , try this on for size : The sectional density ( SD ) - or ratio of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is .226 , whereas the SD of a 140grain .26-caliber bullet is .289 . With the 159-grain bullets traditionally loaded in a 6.5x54 M-S cartridge , the SD is an impressive .326 . For a .30-caliber bullet to have an equivalent SD , it would have to weigh 216 grains . Bullets with a high SD can be compared to a long train-once they get going they are hard to stop . From a hunter 's standpoint , that 's an important distinction . In addition to maintaining their velocity better than shorter and plumper bullets , high-SD bullets are less affected by wind . In order to stabilize these bullets with their long and slender profiles , they must be spun especially fast . Which is why rifles in 6.5x54 M-S and 6.5x55 Swedish calibers have barrels with a rate of twist as fast as one turn in 7.5 inches . ( By comparison a .30/30 has a rifling rate of one turn in 12 . ) There is no shortage of the " enlightened " opinion that high rotational speed improves a bullet 's deadliness on big game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflected . Impact Which takes us to the third measure of a great hunting bullet . Ballistic tables can lead us astray if all we consider are the energy figures . Energy to do what Energy to drive the bullet deep into tissue ? Or energy that breaks up bullets in shallow wounds ? Why was it that the little 6.5x54 M-S-with its seemingly feeble 1,740 ft. lb. of energy-became such a favorite of professional ivory hunters , while cartridges with nearly twice as much muzzle energy were considered unworkable ? The 6.5x54 's success on virtually every type of game was due , in large part , to the internal stability of the pencil-like bullets impacting at moderate speed . Rather than shredding or tumbling , as some bigger and faster bullets are wont to do , the slender , highly stabilized projectiles simply bored a deep , straight hole . Elephant hunters used military-style fulljacketed bullets that penetrated a thick skull without expanding . Soft-nosed bullets were , and are , used for thinnerskinned game . By the 1920s , various versions of the 6.5 cartridge rifles were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one form or another this cartridge was also the caliber of choice of many of the world 's armies . About now you 're getting a pretty good idea of the .260 Remington 's long genealogy and of the reasons it is easy to predict its superiority as a big-game getter . But there is one more chapter in the .260 's story . And that one dates back only as far as the 1994 National Rifle Championships at Camp Perry , Ohio . I 'd not had a particularly good day on the firing line . A flinching problem had raised its monstrous head , so I began to think I needed a cartridge with less recoil than the .308 Win . I 'd used for years . Smaller calibers and lighter bullets would kick less , but the few calibers worth considering raised the specter of unforgivable wind drift and/or increased barrel wear . Time and again , logic turned my thoughts toward a .26 caliber loaded with 120- and 140-grain bullets . Wind drift would be the same or less than with .308 target loads and a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory that accuracy would be superb : When 300-meter target shooting was an Olympic event , rifles in various 6.5 chamberings were consistent medal winners . The problem was that there were no American cartridges anywhere close to what I wanted . The only born-in-theUSA 6.5 cartridge still cataloged was the .264 Winchester Magnum-which was too big and fast for my purposes . The ideal cartridge , I figured , would be close to the 6.5x55 Swedish , which is a bit faster than the 6.5 M-S . It was a longtime favorite in European hunting and target shooting circles , but dammit , I wanted a .26-caliber American cartridge . And if there was n't one , I 'd just have to make it . I sat up the rest of the night sketching out the dimensions and details of two versions of an all-American .26 . One , based on the .250 Savage case , I called the .260 Bobcat , and the other , based on the .308 case , was named the 6.5 Panther . ( I like to name my " wildcat " cartridges after cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chambering reamers had been made by the firm of JGS , and 6.5-mm barrels by both Douglas and Shilen were fitted to a series of test rifles . To say that the initial tests were satisfactory is an understatement Sensational is more like it , with the results and loading data first published here in September 1995 " The Ultimate Caliber " . // BALLISTI CS COMPARISONS // The lead photo of that article showed a 6.5 Panther and a less-than-impressive five-shot group . What the text of the article failed to include was the fact that the group , which measured 1.544 inches across the widest shots , had been fired at 500 yards . I now returned to the National Rifle Championships outfitted with a prototype Winchester target rifle chambered for one of the 6.5 cartridges , and my performance was my best in years . No recoil , no flinching . Rapid-fire timing was much faster than before because , with reduced recoil , recovery time between shots was also reduced . At 600 yards I became so confident I decided to use the 6.5 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnum I normally used for long yardage competition ) . To make a sweet story short , my score tied for high shooter on my relay , but I failed to get into a shoot-off for the Leech Championship because of the tiebreaking procedure . Interestingly , the guy who beat me was using a 6.5 wildcat similar to mine , and , for the first time ever , both 1,000-yard championships , the Leech Cup and the Wimbledon Cups , were won with 6.5caliber cartridges . Clearly , the little .26 was on its way ... and the folks at Remington were already on the case . Either the Bobcat or Panther would be perfect for their shortaction Model 700 , and if teamed with their light and nimble Model Seven , the combination would equal the 6.5 Mannlicher I had picked as my favorite whitetail rig . But which one ? My suggestion was that they go with the 6.5 Panther because of the universal success of the basic all-American .308 case . I also suggested as a result of my testing that the rate of rifling twist be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'd be no confusion about its nationality , that it be called the .260 Remington . Wildcatter Goes Legit About here it may sound like I 'm taking credit for a very good thing , but that really is n't the case . When first describing the 6.5 Panther back in ' 95 , I pointed out that putting a .264-inch diameter bullet in the .308 Winchester hull is so logical that other wildcatters had surely beaten me to that conclusion . Sure enough , a search of old shooting literature proved that to be the case . But almost invariably the experiments were abandoned , due to dissatisfaction with the top velocities obtainable . The goal of most cartridge wildcatting is to push the velocity envelope to its outermost limits , so when the stubby .308 case failed to boost 6.5 bullets to Magnum velocities , interest had waned . The .260 Remington-nee 6.5 Panther-succeeded because its manufacturer recognized that faster is not always better , and that it can even be counterproductive . The trick would be to maintain the venerable Swedish and Mannlicher 6.5s ' exquisite balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve accuracy with a wider range of bullet weights . Thanks in part to the one-in-nine rate of rifling twist that Remington specifies for its .260 , that has been accomplished . In my testing , five-shot groups at 200 yards that measure under an inch were routine with either 120- or 140-grain bullets . This will delight handloaders who want to use the heavier bullets for big game , then switch to light bullets for zippy varmint and small-game loads . Handloaders are also going to discover that they can boost .260 velocities to nearly 200 fps over factory figures-which begs the question of why Remington 's speeds are so conservative . After all , is n't faster better ? No . In point of fact , if Remington 's engineers had succumbed to the " magnumlomania " that has characterized ballistic thinking for the past half a century , the .260 would be just another ho-hum cartridge with little to offer that you ca n't get in half a dozen other calibers . It is because of their recognizing and maintaining the balanced ballistic triangle ( shootability , behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridge you 'll ever take deer hunting . Skeptics need only remember that when velocity goes up so does recoil , and that causes shootability to decrease . The balance is lost and the cartridge actually becomes less effective . Remember what I said about how hard it is to stop a long train ? Take a look at the comparison table on page 25 and you 'll see how the .260 stacks up against popular bullet weights in the .270 Winchester and .308 Winchester . It 's a classic tortoise-and-hare situation , with the mild-kicking .260 starting off at the rear of the pack before catching up and even charging aheadall while remaining less affected by unpredictable crosswinds . Remington 's initial pairing of the .260 will be with its petite 61/4-pound Model Seven bolt rifle-a marriage made in whitetail heaven-and I expect it wo n't be long before other rifle makers will follow with more .260s . Winchester 's M70 Featherweight is a natural , as is the Savage Mill , Ruger 's M77 and Browning 's A-Bolt ( using a BOSS , recoil should almost disappear ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Savage M99 . Ultra Light Arms could easily break the five-pound barrier , scope and all . Either way , this golden apple from a hundredyear-old family tree of cartridges will define hunting ballistics for the 21st century . For target shooting , silhouette and long-range accuracy , it 's already in a class by itself . // SETTING YOUR SIGHTS // <p>
