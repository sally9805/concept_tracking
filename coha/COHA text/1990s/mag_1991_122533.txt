Travis Williams could usually be found standing along Macdonald Avenue  --  you could just never be sure where . He might be in front of Noah 's Ark Gospel Chateau smoking a cigarette , or the Pentecostal Prayer and Deliverance Center sipping from a bottle , or outside the Richmond Rescue Mission lining up for a hot meal . // This was the many-fingered hand of God , in whose palmy grip lay the blighted remains of downtown Richmond , Calif. , a procession of storefront churches and gutted buildings arrayed along a once grand boulevard that now leads nowhere . // The many-fingered hand often beckoned Williams to come inside , but he preferred to remain on the street , standing in the need of prayer . Williams was the perpetual outsider , often because of circumstances he could never seem to control . Following a five-year NFL career during which he helped lead the Green Bay Packers to victory in Super Bowl II and twice led the league in kick returns , Williams got caught in a downward spiral of financial setbacks and personal tragedies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even after his children persuaded him in 1988 to move back into the house in which he had grown up , Williams said he never felt more than a step or two away from the street . " I do n't feel that 's all behind me yet , " he said one day in December while sitting in the small , dilapidated wood-frame house . // On Jan. 14 he turned 45 and became eligible for a $300 monthly stipend from the NFL Players Association pension fund . Williams had not had a regular income since 1989 ; he earned pocket money by hauling trash , collecting cans for the nickel deposits and helping people move . In the last year he had suffered from gout , which caused his ankles to swell so badly that even walking was difficult . When the NFL pension became available , Williams took it , even though he would have gotten as much as $580 a month if he had waited another 10 years . " I ai n't waiting until 55 , " he once said , " not the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to his friends among the homeless , 17 of whom had died within the past year . Williams often allowed his homeless friends to sleep on one of the broken-springed sofas in his living room whenever the weather in the Bay Area turned cold , perhaps because homelessness is not a condition you can leave behind simply by finding a roof . " People either make it out of homelessness , or they die trying , " says Susan Prather , an advocate for the homeless who had befriended Williams . " Travis had come a long way . " // A month after Williams filed for his pension , his body began to shut down , one organ after another . On Feb. 15 he was admitted to Merrithew Memorial Hospital , and two days later he died . " He was terrified of the hospital , " says Prather . He saw no point in taking chances . // " It ai n't much of a hospital , " Williams would say , " and I 'm not in the best of health . " Williams did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to ; it was what had driven him to the streets . In many ways the death he had chosen for himself was a direct result of the life he had not chosen . // Six years ago his wife had died of a drug overdose in a hospital emergency room , and six months after that his mother died during colon-cancer surgery , which Travis had persuaded her to have . Two deaths in one year , and it was not over . " Then my sister moved here from San Bernardino to help me out with the kids , " said Williams , " and she was n't here a year when she died . She was my baby sister , and her whole insides just collapsed . She drinked a lot . Then my best friend , Harold , he died six months after that . // " It seemed like it was a curse , like I was plagued with some kind of bad luck . Every time I told one of them to go to the hospital for some simple operation , they never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girlfriend , and she developed spinal cancer . She said , ' Travis , you know how your record is taking people to the hospital , so I believe I 'll just take myself . ' But she never came back either . " // Like most homeless people , Williams did not simply walk out of his house one day and take up a life in the streets because he enjoyed being outdoors . His descent from foreclosure to flophouse was the result of a long , agonizing run of misfortune and bad judgment . " It 's bad breaks , bad deals , and one day you wake up sleeping in your car , " he said . // Other than a dollar bill that was found in his shoe , Williams was penniless when he died . He had spent some time living in the backseat of a car  --  perhaps as much as two years ; it was a subject about which he was understandably vague  --  and he never cared much for it . " Living in a car is uncomfortable , embarrassing and depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with it . " // His children tried to get him to move in with them when they found him in 1985 , but Williams refused to consider their offer . " I did n't want my family to see me like that , " he said , " down and out . Besides , I 'm supposed to be the one to take care of them . They are n't supposed to take care of me. " // When his bouts of depression became bottomless , so did his drinking . " A six-pack of beer turned into a case , " he said . " A bottle of wine became two bottles , then more . I was out on the streets , acting a fool . In the morning I 'd be to the liquor store and meet the man when he opened up at 6 a.m. , then I 'd drink to ease the pain . I wanted to pass out as fast as I could . " // Sometimes Williams would go to a vacant lot on a side street in Richmond and curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timber used by the homeless for whatever shelter it provided . " I 'd go down there and split a bottle of wine with somebody , " said Williams . He would stand there for hours , hands in his pockets , except when he was trying to panhandle change for cigarettes . When night fell on this ragged encampment , you could see only the outline of figures pitching back and forth in the dark , like driftwood churning on the surface of a great sea . // Williams had to run a bureaucratic gantlet to receive the few benefits the system had to offer him . On his regular odyssey across town to fight through the red tape , he passed between the two vastly different worlds that exist side by side in Contra Costa County . It is the second-richest county in California , but until last year it did n't have a single government-subsidized shelter for the homeless . The county once insisted that to qualify for general assistance funds , Williams and other homeless people had to provide an address where they could receive their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find people beds , it made the number unlisted so it would n't be swamped with calls . // In 1988 , Williams worked as a security guard at a Richmond soup kitchen sponsored by the Volunteers of America , eating there regularly and making sure none of the guests went through the line twice . Just behind the soup kitchen is a complex of 12 apartments that was designed as transitional housing for single homeless men who are working and have no drug or alcohol problems  --  a group so small that the apartments usually sit empty . Down the block from the center is a storefront blood bank where people sell their blood twice a week  --  the maximum allowed  --  for $6.50 a pint , just about the price of a bottle of fortified wine . // No matter where he was , though  --  at a soup kitchen or inside the Capitol in Washington , D.C. , where he was once arrested for staging a sit-in demonstration in the office of California senator Alan Cranston to protest cuts in federal housing programs for the poor  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Is that the Road-runner ? " It was . " They still call mc that , " Williams said , " the people who still remember . " // No one who saw the Roadrunner in full flight in 1967 , the Packers ' last championship season , will forget him . On Oct. 30 , in what was the first NFL game in which he had returned a kickoff , Williams went straight up the middle for 93 yards and a touchdown against the St. Louis Cardinals . When Green Bay faced the Cleveland Browns later that year , Williams ran back two kickoffs for touchdowns in the first quarter . // " All Travis needed was just a little bit of space , " says Herb Adderley , the Packers ' Hall of Fame cornerback , who was a teammate . " After two or three steps he was in full flight , and he had psychic peripheral vision . He would see cracks , and by the time guys coming straight down-field could turn and chase , it was already too late . " // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per return , still the NFL record for a season . " That was midfield every time I touched the ball , " he said . " The funny thing about being known for those kick returns is that I only ran back 18 that year . They started kicking the ball away from me. " // Williams had set the national junior college record for the 100-yard dash when he ran a 9.3 at Contra Costa College , but it was n't until his freshman season there that he ever carried a football . He played running back for two years at Arizona State , and Green Bay took him in the fourth round of the ' 67 draft . While playing in front of Packer coach Vince Lombardi during preseason camp , Williams became so nervous that he began dropping the ball . " I remember Lombardi taping up the football and putting a handle on it for Travis , " says Adderley. // Lombardi told Williams he wanted him to keep the ball with him at all times , even when he was sleeping . " Lombardi had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I was his boy  --  his secret weapon , so to speak . " // Williams returned four kicks for touchdowns that year , the first time anyone in the league had ever done that . " He turned several games around for us and was one of the factors that took us to the championship , " says Jim Grabowski , a fullback on that team . // In a playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams , Williams scored two TDs from scrimmage , one a 46-yard dash off tackle . The high point of his life came a few weeks later , when he reached what for him would turn out to be middle age . On Jan. 14 , 1968 , the Packers beat the Oakland Raiders 33-14 in Super Bowl II . It was his 22nd birthday . // Twelve years later Williams 's career had ended , his money and his house were gone . Even the ring he earned playing for the Super Bowl champions had been stolen . All that remained were his five NFL records and a nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but trouble . Green Bay traded him to Los Angeles in 1971 , where he managed one last hurrah  --  a 105-yard return for a TD against the New Orleans Saints  --  before blowing out his knee the following preseason. // " In 1967 I figured the money would last forever , " Williams said . " Everybody thought I was rich , and so did I. " // He never made more than $28,000 a season playing for the Packers ; $35,000 while playing for the Rams . Travis and his wife , Arie , spent the spring following his rookie year squiring themselves up and down the California coastline in a 1951 Jaguar he had bought . " It did n't take a lot for us to live like the president , " he said . " We 'd rent two adjoining rooms  --  great big rooms  --  put the kids in the other room and have a time . We 'd drive up and down the freeway and stop for a few days at a hotel and just enjoy ourselves . " // Williams spent two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football . During that time he went through what little savings he had , attempting to support a family that now included eight children . " The money was going real fast , even though we did n't live like kings and queens , " Williams said . " Maybe I was looking for something to come when I should have gone out and gotten it . I hated standing on the street corner , broke and trying to be cool . " // Desperate for a way off the corner , he took what was to become the first of many jobs as a security guard , this one with the Richmond school district . One by one , Williams sold the five cars he had parked outside his three-bedroom house at the corner of 19th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Richmond . It was too late , however . The weight of his debts was far too crushing . // " It was like , boom , there go the cars , then boom , there went the house , " he said , recalling his eviction in 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever happened to me . It was a long time before I could even look at that house again . The thing that took a lot out of me was that I could have paid for the house when I bought it . But I thought I 'd play ball forever , so I only put a down payment on it . // " When we lost the house , we had to get out in a hurry . People were saying , ' What are you doing with all that money ? ' and I had nothing . I wanted the public to believe I sold the house , when in fact we lost it . So we moved to Hunter 's Point in San Francisco . It was the projects , the ghetto , but it allowed me to get away from the neighborhood for about a year . It was a little bit embarrassing and a lot of stress . Being a Green Bay Packer player was supposed to make you somebody special . I could n't bear to have people say , ' You just blew your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant " with a big Packer hat outside to get some of that sports trade , " but he never had enough money to get it started . " I had real big plans , " he said . " I always felt something good was going to happen , maybe tomorrow . " // He drifted into work as a bouncer at a flophouse in downtown Richmond called the Bonds Hotel , where he also lived in a six-by eight-foot room for $50 a week . " If you were looking for trouble by the half pound , or the full pound retail , " Williams said , " that was really the place to be . " // What was it Adderley said about psychic peripheral vision ? Williams never had it in real life . In 1979 he broke the jaw of a man he found with Arie . " He was someplace he should n't have been , " said Williams , " and she was someplace she should n't have been . " Williams was convicted of felony battery and was sentenced to a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arie killed a man while driving drunk and was sent to the same jail for a year . More than the loss of his home , that marked the beginning of the dissolution of his family . The children were divided between the two sets of grandparents . // When Williams was released , the only job he could get was as a security guard at the liquor store where he was already spending most of his money . Jail did n't improve his relationship with Arie , from whom he separated a few months later , after he had moved the family frantically from apartment to apartment . " When I moved out , the devil moved in , " Williams said . " She was disappearing to Oakland for two or three weeks at a time . My kids had to listen to people tell them their mama was nothing but a dopehead. " // Now living alone , Williams denied himself none of the pleasure poisons the street had to offer  --  smoking , drinking and eating all the wrong foods . His teeth had been rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke apart so deep below the gumline that it cut an artery . " They almost lost me on that one , " he said . " I did n't want to go to the hospital , but I was spitting out blood by the mouthful . My teeth had gotten so bad over the years they were poisoning me . I 'd have a toothache every other day . I was in the hospital for a week , so I said , ' As long as you 're in there , take ' em all out . ' " He was still waiting for the county to fit him with a set of new teeth when he died . // He had " come inside " in 1988 , at last heeding his children 's requests . He moved into his deceased parents ' old house with his youngest sons , Dennis , 25 , and Malcolm , 16 . " This is the fortress here , " said Travis . // He spent most of his time watching television , particularly the old NFL Films highlight shows on cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not being what 's happening , but close to it , " he said . " Then I come home . " // The cause of death was listed as heart failure . No one who knew him well really believed that . His heart was one of the few things that could never fail him . Five hundred people came to the services for Williams at the St. John Baptist Church . The NFL did send a representative , but none of the Packers he had played with attended , though the team did send former linebacker Gary Weaver . // It did n't really matter , though . Williams had found contentment in his new life working with Prather as an advocate for the homeless  --  he took part in several demonstrations in the Richmond area  --  and , for the first time since his playing days , he thought of himself as someone who had accomplished something worthwhile . Williams wanted to be a role model for homeless people , to prove that it was possible to make it off the streets . Shortly before he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once told me , ' People respect you , they like you , you 're like a magnet . ' People put their trust in me , and I help them with their problems . It 's better for me now in some ways . I know what it 's like to be down , so the only way for me is up . " The field is all in front of him now , and the Roadrunner is just gathering speed .
