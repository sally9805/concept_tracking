An Olympic message to NBC : Here 's how to avoid the dreaded Nagano no-no 's that bedeviled CBS . Headnote TO : NBC Sports execs FROM : Entertainment Weekly RE : How not to screw up the 2000 Games in Sydney . // As negative reviews of the Nagano Olympics keep rolling in , you 're probably kicking back and pitying your colleagues at CBS . But keep in mind : There but for the grace of Juan Antonio Samaranch .... In two years , it 'll be NBC 's turn to tackle the Olympics in Sydney , and you 'll be facing the same half-day time difference that stymied CBS , leading to the lowest-rated Games since 1968 . Time to panic yet ? Probably not . For one thing , despite the low ratings ( 16.2 overall , 42 percent below CBS ' 27.8 rating for Lillehammer in ' ' 94 ) , which forced the network to provide a raft of " make-good ads " for its sponsors , CBS will still net a profit of roughly $75 million . And the Eye will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory in the key 18-to-49 demographic . " We 're going to do just fine , " says CBS TV president Leslie Moonves . " There were mistakes made , but the good news is it 's going to hurt NBC more next time than it hurts us now . " What his little parting shot means is that ad rates for the next Games will be based , partly , on Nagano 's ratings . In fact , in the suspicious eyes of many , that 's just why NBC threw in the towel in February , " competing " mostly with repeats to boost its rival 's Olympic viewership . " NBC laid down , " says a rival network chief . " It was an economic consideration . " Responds NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield : " We did n't lay down . But why waste original programming in prime time when most of the audience is going to be watching the Olympics ? " Of course , given Nagano 's poor showing , do n't expect the other networks to play dead in 2000 . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy list of Olympic do 's and don'ts : DO N'T obsess over prime time . CBS badly underestimated the damage done by the 14hour time difference between Japan and the States . Telecasts of dramatic events , such as Austrian skier Hermann Maier 's remarkable gold-medal run in the Super G , felt flat after they were held for a day so as not to disrupt previously scheduled prime-time events . That kind of strategy might have worked in the past , but today , what with 24-hour news channels and Internet updates , news ai n't what it used to be . " There is an instant-result capability now that did n't exist six to eight years ago , " says Neal Pilson , former president of CBS Sports . " Events show up before they air on the network . " Pilson advises NBC to broadcast live as much as possible , even on its cable networks MSNBC and CNBC . Photograph // DO go with the flow . Clearly , stronger news sensibilities were needed in Nagano . When an earthquake hit the area last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . And granted , compelling stories , it la Dan Jansen , were rare . As CBS ' Nagano executive producer Rick Gentile says bluntly : " It was a boring Olympics . " Still , the network was unable to develop the stories that did emerge , such as Picabo Street 's surprise Super G gold . " Sports writes a better story by itself than Ernest Hemingway could , " says Jon Mandel , senior VP of Grey Advertising . " Yet CBS felt compelled to try and outwrite sports . " Consider the pointless broadcasts of figure skating practices , needlessly hyping what was already the showcase of the Games , the Tara Lipinski-Michelle Kwan duel . And for that we missed seeing more of the golden U.S. women 's hockey team ? DO N'T worry about the Olympics franchise as a whole . In CBS ' defense , the singular mix of an unfamiliar locale , disastrous weather , and no stars was the main reason for poor ratings . Which means that future Games should n't lose their luster as premier programming events . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says analyst Steve Sternberg of TN Media , " they understand that the Winter Games in 2002 are taking place in Salt Lake City and will do better . " And as for Sydney , notes Littlefield , the Summer Games " have historically been a phenomenal American success story . Our athletes are always competitive . " And U.S. golds mean U.S. viewers . Of course , all of that will be little comfort to CBS . That might explain the song played during the closing credits of Nagano 's final telecast : " Let 's Call the Whole Thing Off .
