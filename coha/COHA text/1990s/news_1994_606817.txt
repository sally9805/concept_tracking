<p> Kenny Curtis is a man who makes his living talking . At 6 a.m. each weekday this hip host wakes up families with his " All-American Alarm Clock Show , " a children 's radio broadcast that snagged the title of Best Morning Show in Washington at the recent Achievement in Radio awards . <p> Curtis is also the father of a young boy who can not talk . Morgan , 2 , is autistic . <p> The irony does n't escape Curtis that his spitting image not only ca n't speak , but probably ca n't understand anything his daddy is paid to say . It 's a bittersweet reality that both propels the 25-year-old Curtis to work 60 hours a week and breathes life and humor into his bouncy radio tenor . " I 've learned so much about how important communication is , how to communicate how you really feel , " he says . <p> Communication is words , for sure , but also much more . It 's tickling your son until giggles erupt from his little round belly even as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . It 's crawling around on the floor playing " The Lion King 's " Mufasa to your 4-year-old daughter 's Simba . It 's working a synthesizer to mesmerize your live studio audience with the sound of a soaring plane , and softening your telephone banter so you can pull the right answer out of a shy 8-year-old caller . <p> Communication is connecting however you can , whether you 're building an audience or a family . In Curtis 's case , he 's doing both , and one inspires the other . <p> At 9 a.m. on a Thursday over at WKDL-AM ( 1050 ) , " Wild Thing " is making hearts sing , Kermit the Frog 's version that is . " I love the Muppets , " Curtis croons in the Silver Spring studio , straddling a chair backward as he works the board , two computers and a mike . " They 're perfect for what we do . " <p> Curtis looks the perfect part for an All-American anything . He 's a tall stick of timber in faded jeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps falling in his face . <p> His show originates one day in Silver Spring , the next in Towson , two of three stations that make up the Radio Zone , subscribers to the Children 's Satellite Network . For five hours he plays about 12 songs an hour , interspersed with trivia contests , news , weather , traffic , visiting elementary school students and conversation with any of 10 characters he created for the show . <p> Using his voice synthesizer he debates with Forrest Skunk and needles Conan the Librarian . On Election Day , Leon the Rat ran the show while Curtis was " out voting . " His first character was Dirk , " the Fourth and Forgotten Chipmunk , the original drummer to Alvin and his crew . " <p> " Good Morning Dirk , " he chirps . " How are you doing ? <p> " Hello Kenny . ... I 'm just looking out the window here , at the clouds . Do n't you love to see what shapes you can make out of the clouds ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I see one over there that kinda looks like a Picassoesque abstract mosaic of Da Vinci 's " Last Supper " with Christ sort of tilting his head toward the heavens in a gesture of supplication . ... It 's really quite moving . " <p> " Well I was gon na say I see a ducky and a horsey but I think I 'm gon na change my mind . ... " <p> Picasso wo n't make a 4-year-old chortle , but Kenny and his bosses , station owners Virginia Carson and Larry Kessner , are hoping the youngster 's parents will . They estimate that 50 percent of their listenership is in the car and children , they remind their growing number of advertisers , do n't drive cars . Grown-ups do . <p> Children 's radio is a hot market right now , partly because children 's TV watching has dipped , according to Debbie Solomon , who chairs the Children 's Research Council of the Advertising Research Foundation . Pop artists , advertisers and station owners are banking on their belief that the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their boomer parents . " Great music for great kids and anyone who used to be a kid ! " Curtis pipes into the mike several times each morning , as he reaches for " Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips " by Bruce Springsteen , or the Beatles ' " Yellow Submarine . " <p> Curtis also plays carefully selected top pop hits ; those who used to be a kid do n't particularly want their children listening to the howls of Snoop Doggy Dogg . Curtis enjoys a long leash when it comes to designing his show  --  this helps account for its creativity  --  but his bosses have set the parameters : no inappropriate language , no newscasts about lifestyle debates ( read sex ) or unwanted children ( read Union County , S.C. ) . The dirtiest Curtis gets may be his forecast during last summer 's hot spell : " Armpit stains likely , heavy deodorant recommended . " <p> If Susan Huber , Curtis 's newscaster , were to report about violence in Haiti , she would begin , " Haiti is an island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the goal , which is fine with Curtis , who does n't allow either of his children to play with guns or watch TV 's " Power Rangers . " <p> " Kids need to develop a healthy skepticism about the media , " Curtis says . Before he took the Radio Zone job in February 1993 , he hosted Fox 45 Clubhouse , a Baltimore-based children 's TV program . There he regularly reminded his young audience that they were watching television , not real life , by carrying on " conversations " with Mr. Camera , the name he gave his camera operator . <p> The line is not always drawn easily however , either at work or home . Curtis and his program director , Dan Turner , decided not to play the " Power Rangers " theme song but then Kemp Mill Music donated Power Ranger Power Pack cassettes to give away as prizes . What to do ? Play the theme song and rationalize , as Curtis did : " It 's now number one ( on Fox Kids Countdown , the Fox network 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting it . " <p> Kim Curtis , Kenny 's wife , made a similar concession when she bought Power Rangers underwear for Jillian . " But Mom , " her daughter protested , " you do n't like the Power Rangers ! " Kim told her , " They were on sale . " <p> Pushing Madison Avenue every day can be a little unnerving for someone who keeps Red Dog beer in his refrigerator and a Bob Marley poster over it . Not a weekend goes by that Curtis is n't asked to make appearances on behalf of advertisers  --  a Bullets game with Dannon Yogurt and Giant Food , breakfast with Santa at Prince George 's Plaza . <p> Most of the time , he handles this part of his job with characteristic humor  --  " I 'm just a human marketing tool "  --  but he misses the time away from his family : " I worry that I 'm nicer to other people 's kids than I am to my own . " The Christmas season is particularly brutal . " If I have to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sentence fragment hangs there , an empty threat that Curtis knows he can not carry out . Here 's another irony : He may have to step up his appearances because next month , Morgan starts an expensive new therapy at home . <p> At first Morgan was n't vocalizing the way normal 1-year-olds do and tests suggested he simply had a hearing problem . <p> But Kenny and Kim watched him get worse . Once " I 'd say so big , " Kenny remembers , circling his arms above his head , " and he 'd raise his arms , too . Then he stopped doing that . " Morgan retreated into his own world and became increasingly indifferent to his family . <p> Shortly before Halloween , Curtis took Morgan into a costume shop and Morgan ran toward the back room for employees . Curtis stopped him and Morgan erupted like a little volcano with all the tears , screams and furious thrashing that a 2-year-old can muster . Curtis , who has n't gotten used to the stares that his own celebrity status brings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying what 's wrong with your child , you 're spoiling your child , " he recalls . <p> It was n't until last month that Kenny and Kim Curtis received the official explanation for such erratic behavior . A brain scan taken while Morgan was sedated showed his hearing was fine . Doctors diagnosed autism , a little-understood neurological disorder affecting two to four children out of 10,000 . Morgan 's brain was absorbing stimuli but was unable to process it . He could hear speech but was n't able to understand it . " It 's like living in a foreign country and not understanding anything anyone says , " Kenny Curtis explains . <p> Only a couple of months before , Curtis 's father Bernie , who lives a short car drive away in Towson , had been diagnosed with cancer . Abnormal , parasitic cells were marching through Bernie 's lungs undeterred by massive doses of drugs . Kenny Curtis was losing his father as well as his son . <p> In Bernie , Kenny had a model of the father he was trying to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a source of unconditional love . Bernie and Judy Curtis had divorced when Kenny was 5  --  Bernie 's alcoholism was one reason  --  and the children had lived with their mother . But every weekend , Kenny says , Bernie appeared at his ex 's door , ready to pick up his four children for a visit . <p> Bernie eventually began a recovery process that kept him sober and when Kenny entered high school , he went to live with his dad . He became increasingly interested in drama  --  his dad was a musician and actor  --  and Bernie encouraged him to pursue his dream , even if it meant slinging hash at Bennigan 's and waiting for his big break . Kenny was about to do exactly that after graduating from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County  --  he had even brought home a Bennigan 's application  --  when his mother-in-law saw a newspaper ad that Fox Television 's Baltimore station was looking for a host . <p> Boom , he was hired and became an instant hit in his hometown . Three years later he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few months after that he was standing in a hospital room talking to a man who was hooked up to machines and going home at night to a 2-year-old who resisted even the simple routine of putting on his pajamas . <p> " At times it was overwhelming , " he says , running his hand through his surfer hair . " I felt I had no control , that there was nothing I could do . " <p> In fact , there are things he has been able to do . Once or twice a week , Kenny and Kim Curtis drive over to see Bernie , now back in his own house . Kenny sucks out Bernie 's tracheotomy tube with an air pump . He grinds up pills using mortar and pestle . <p> When his schedule prevents him from " doing daddy duty , " as they jokingly call these visits , Kim Curtis goes by herself . Kim , who also acts , has pulled back from the full-time pursuit of her professional dream to make this family run , and she 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Morgan . The Louvaas treatment is an intensive one-on-one behavior modification program . She and Kenny plan to start it next month . <p> Being borderline nuts for five hours each morning on the radio is something Kenny can do to relieve his own stress  --  as well as that of thousands of morning commuters . <p> It 's 10:36 a.m. and the Beltway is still backed up in spots . " Where 's that ' Mission Impossible ' tape ? " Curtis asks . He prepares to switch programming to Radio AAHS , the Children 's Satellite flagship station in Minneapolis . <p> " Stick a fork in it , I 'm over , " he announces into the mike . " I 'm hooking you up to the Mother Ship . " With a flick of a switch he starts the Seven Dwarfs singing the chipper " Hi-Ho , Hi-Ho , it 's off to work we go ! " <p> It is Morgan 's favorite song . <p> CAPTION : Deejay Kenny Curtis , host of " All-American Alarm Clock Show , " with guests from Burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the air at WKDL-AM radio ( 1050 ) .
