WHAT BEGAN AS A HAIL OF GUNFIRE NEAR A NEW York City subway continues as a war of words over police training and attitudes . Two white transit cops sprayed 21 shots at a man in a dispute they deemed dangerous  --  only to find the man was a black plainclothes officer , Derwin Pannell . The white officers involved claim Pannell had his gun drawn ( he was stopping a fare beater ) .

It does n't help that a similar situation took place in Nashville in December , when two white officers were dismissed for allegedly beating a black undercover cop ; the two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
