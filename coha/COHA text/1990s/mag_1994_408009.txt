Every baby is unique . That 's one of the pleasures of parenthood : discovering the special , individual qualities of your own baby . It can also be one of the pitfalls , because many of us have expectations of our babies that are n't matched by reality . If your baby is breastfed , you may find that he does n't fit the norm  --  because the norms of the past were primarily based on formula - fed infants . Breastfed babies are different . E.J. Shames - Muzyka noticed the difference when she and her baby son , Arin , were visiting relatives . One sister - in - law had a bottle - fed baby close to Arin 's age . Her baby had a bottle every four hours while I never seemed to get off the couch because I was always nursing Arin , " E.J. remembers . " He had short feedings  --  five minutes or so  --  but then he 'd want to nurse again in an hour or so . " Breastmilk is more quickly and easily digested than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently . This naturally varies quite a bit from baby to baby , and there are some nursing babies who go as long as four hours between feedings . The average , however , is closer to 2 - 1/2 hours , and some babies will nurse more often . When E.J. 's second child , Daniella , was born , she found she was n't nursing her as frequently as she had Arin . " But , " E.J. recalls , " she nursed longer at each feeding , and I found that hard at first because I was n't expecting it . " Figure not transcribed Not only do breastfed babies normally nurse frequently , they will have " growth spurt " days when they need to nurse even more frequently in order to build up mother 's milk supply . The bottle - feeding parent whose baby seems unusually hungry can offer a few ounces more of formula ; the breastfeeding mother must rely on her baby 's extra nursings to signal her breasts that it 's time to produce more milk . Many mothers also notice early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While bottle - fed babies tend to have regular bowel movements that look ( and smell ) almost like those of adults ( and may become constipated from time to time ) , that easy - to - digest breastmilk produces bowel movements that are yellow , very loose and runny ( like thick pea soup ) and that have only a faint , yeasty smell . In the early weeks , many breastfed babies will have a bowel movement with every feeding . As they grow older , they often change to a bowel movement every few days , and may go as long as a week or ten days . The baby may seem to strain or cry when she finally fills that diaper , but the bowel movement is still loose and soft when it appears . Marcia Cudmore breastfed her first baby , Daniel , until he was six months old and then switched to formula when she returned to work . She noticed that he was constipated on the first ( iron - enriched ) formula they tried , and they had to switch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When he was sick , she had to change to a non - milk - based formula . Her second child , Bethany , is still breastfeeding at 20 months , and Marcia 's delighted to have avoided these digestive problems . Digestibility is just one of the differences between breastfed and bottle - fed babies . E.J. noticed that her babies woke more often at night to feed and continued to do so until they were older than the bottle - fed babies she knew about . Again , there are many variations here , and some breastfed babies do sleep through the night at an early age . But because of the easy digestibility of breastmilk , night feedings may be needed for a longer period of time . Marcia , for example , found that despite being on a bottle Daniel was 18 months old before he began sleeping through the night . " Both of my children have been night - wakers . The difference , " Marcia comments , " is that with Bethany I was much more rested . I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just roll over and nurse . " The difference E.J. was happiest to note was that her babies were clearly healthier . " I come from a very allergic family , and both my children do have some food allergies . But they have only fairly minor symptoms . The bottle - fed children I know with the same kind of family history have eczema , asthma and repeated ear infections . We 've avoided all that . " Marcia adds : " Daniel had bouts of asthma after he started on formula , and he 's had at least four ear infections a year . Bethany 's only had one ear infection since she was born . We 're definitely making a lot fewer trips to the doctor this time . " While there are many factors that can affect a baby 's health , these mothers ' observations are backed up by research , which has shown that breastfed babies are less likely to have various illnesses , including respiratory infections ( such as colds or pneumonia ) , stomach problems ( such as the flu ) , earinfections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly when they do become ill , thanks to antibodies produced in the mother 's breast . Allergies and allergic reactions are also minimized by breastfeeding . One area that causes concern for many new parents is the baby 's rate of growth . Sometimes mothers are encouraged to wean or add solids to the baby 's diet because he is not keeping up with the growth charts . However , a 1991 study discovered that breastfed babies grow at a different rate than formula - fed babies and are normally leaner ( but still healthy and developing normally ) . Since the standard growth charts are based primarily on bottle - fed infants , the researchers recommended creating new charts for breastfed babies . Figure not transcribed Marcia is an all - round advocate for nursing : " Continuing to breastfeed also helps me to be more relaxed  --  when everything seems to be falling apart , I just sit down and nurse . Then I relax , the baby 's happy , everyone feels better . It really is an asset for the whole family . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
