Florida entered the Union as the twenty-seventh state one hundred and fifty ago this year . Some twenty-five years ago Sam and Robbie Vickers of Jacksonville began collecting paintings , drawings , and prints that depicted the history , life and landscape of their native state . No one had attempted to do so before , and no one has since . Patiently and persistently , they have built a remarkable collection that fittingly hangs in their house overlooking the majestic Saint Johns River , which had an attraction for artists in Florida comparable to that of the Hudson River in New York . Like the Hudson , the Saint Johns River passes some of the most beautiful places in the state . Artists did not come to Florida in any numbers until later in its history as a state , and they did not come primarily to paint , as they had earlier to the Catskill Mountains in New York , the White Mountains in New Hampshire , or , after the Civil War , to the western frontier . They came to Florida for their health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ( Winslow Homer ) . Largely for that reason  --  as the Vickerses candidly admit  --  a significant collection of art devoted to Florida could not be shaped solely by considerations of quality or the artists ' reputations . In addition to Inness , Homer , Hunt , Martin Johnson Heade , Thomas Moran , and William Glackens , Florida was visited more often by lesser-known artists . And visited is the operative word , with the major exception of Heade , who came to Saint Augustine in 1883 and died there in 1904 , by then the leader of a small art colony . That said , the Vickers collection is wonderfully rich , remarkably deep , and filled with the most delightful and enlightening surprises . The earliest work in the collection is a watercolor of 1829 by the thirteen-year-old George Washington Sully(1) of a house in Magnolia , painted about the time the town was settled ( Pl . IV ) . One of the latest works is Florida Swamp ( Pl . XI ) by Glackens . It was once believed to have been painted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War as an illustrator for McClure 's magazine . However , its fluently impressionistic style is incompatible with his work of that period , and as Henry Adams has proposed , ( 2 ) it was most probably painted in 1932 when Glackens visited his artist friend Ernest Lawson ( 1873-1939 ) ( 3 ) in Coral Gables . This is Glackens 's only known painting of Florida , and on the basis of its restrained , subtle color and its masterful brushwork , one can only regret that he did not paint more . Sully 's and Glackens 's paintings bracket many others that share similar subjects . A number of them , like Sully 's , depict the settlement of Florida and aspects of life there . The Hudson River school painter John Bunyan Bristol , for example , visited Florida in 1859 , on the eve of the Civil War , and his depiction of the life led by the blacks ( Pl . III ) can not be an entirely innocent account of the issue that soon divided the nation . The view shown in Plate XIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Brock in the small town of Enterprise . The hotel was reached by steamer along the Saint Johns River , and after the Civil War it was the destination of such illustrious visitors as President Ulysses S. Grant , General William Tecumseh Sherman , and Winslow Homer . The latter came to Enterprise several times beginning in 1886 , calling it " the most beautiful place in Florida . " ( 4 ) The painting in Plate II shows the twin towers of the Ponce de Leon , a hotel in Saint Augustine designed by the prominent architectural firm of Carrere and Hastings and opened in 1888 . It was the first of a chain of grand hotels built by Henry Morrison Flagler ( 1830-1913 ) along the east coast of Florida . They were served by the Florida East Coast Railway , which Flagler also built , diverting tourists from such places as Enterprise to the coastal resorts that stretched from Saint Augustine to Key West . A painting of 1908 by William Aiken Walker entitled Lower Matecumbe Key ( also in the Vickers collection ) shows Flagler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was abandoned after a hurricane destroyed many miles of it in 1935 . Walker 's Ocklawaha River ( Pl . XIV ) and Ocklawaha Steamer ( Pl . XV ) of 1888 are , like the paired and series paintings of Thomas Cole ( 1801-1848 ) , narratives of profound historical change  --  in this case of the steamboat as it invades and forever destroys the primeval quiet of the Florida wilderness . Florida history is represented respectively rather than prospectively in Louis Comfort Tiffany 's painting of Saint Augustine ( Pl . VIII ) , which depicts the Castillo de San Marcos ( now Fort Marion ) , begun in 1672 . It is the oldest masonry fort in the United States and the most permanent symbol of the antiquity of settlement in Florida . One of Florida 's greatest historical figures , Osceola , the leader of the Seminole Indians during the Second Seminole War in 1835 , is the subject of the portrait in Plate VI , which is a copy of an original life portrait by George Catlin. ( 5 ) Catlin drew the " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imprisoned at Fort Moultrie in Charleston , South Carolina , where he died later that year . That drawing also served as the basis for the one shown on the contents page of this issue , which is from the souvenir album Catlin made for the duke of Portland ( probably the fifth duke , William John Cavendish Bentinck-Scott 1800-1879 ) . The most important artists to visit Florida were attracted by its landscape , not its history . This can be seen as part of the more general lure of the tropics in the late nineteenth century , the most celebrated example being the French artist Paul Gauguin 's move to Tahiti . William Morris Hunt came to Florida in 1873 and 1874 to recuperate from a nervous collapse caused by the loss of his studio in the Boston fire of 1872 A student of Thomas Couture ( 1815-1879 ) and a disciple of Jean Francois Millet ( 1814-1875 ) , Hunt was chiefly a figure and portrait painter . Late in life , however , he showed great promise as a landscape painter-an aptitude not fully realized because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View of the St. Johns River ( Pl . X ) is particularly beautiful for its subtle coloration , the limpid stillness of the scene , and the warm , moist density of the atmosphere . Hunt was so impressed by Florida 's climate  --  so different from that of his native New England  --  that it is depicted as the principal feature of nature . Thomas Moran visited Florida in 1877 to illustrate an article for Scribner 's Monthly about one of the Sea Islands at the mouth of the Saint Johns River . Coming on the heels of his great Western paintings The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and Chasm of the Colorado of 1872 and 1873 respectively , ( 7 ) the Florida landscape could not have been a greater contrast . Nevertheless , in the painting shown in Plate XII he captured the distinctive light and lush landscape of Florida as convincingly and dramatically as he had the arid and spacious landscape of the American West . This is one of the most captivating paintings in the Vickers collection and one of Moran 's greatest Florida canvases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Martin Johnson Heade 's first important Florida painting . Of all the artists who came to the state , he was most prepared by sensibility and experience for its flatness and relative featurelessness , in comparison to the scenery of the Northeast and the West , which had established the norm for the American landscape . Heade found in Florida the counterpart to the salt marshes of New England and New Jersey , which had been the chief subject of his landscapes since the 1860s . Indeed , it is sometimes difficult to be sure which were painted where . George Inness began visiting Florida in 1890 , when he took a house and studio in Tarpon Springs on the Gulf Coast . Like Moran , and indeed most artists who visited Florida , Inness came to it from experiences of very different kinds of American , French , and Italian landscapes . But like Moran he quickly came to grips with its distinctive properties and painted a number of his most beautiful late landscapes there ( see Pl . XVIII ) . Winslow Homer was not only the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one who spent the most time there . On his first trip in January 1886 he visited Jacksonville , Tampa , and Key West , painting : about a dozen watercolors in the last two places . He returned to Florida in 1890 , going to Enterprise chiefly to fish , but also to pain watercolors . Although he made four more trips to Florida , he painted again only on his 1903-1904 visit . One of his most splendid watercolors , Black Bass , Florida ( Pl . V ) , dates from that visit . As an avid fisherman , it was a subject he knew intimately and directly , yet like all his paintings of sporting subjects , it is not , in the conventional sense , a sporting painting . The startling immediacy of the hooked fish rising almost in one 's face creates a sense of drama and expressive force that few sporting paintings achieve . The monumentality of effect is vastly greater in Homer 's hands than is normally found in paintings of this size and in this medium . Despite the episodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , and despite the great diversity of their resulting work , the Vickers collection is remarkable f-r its coherence and or the evidence of a special inspiration that binds it together . 1 An article about Sully appeared in Antiques , March 1983 , pp. 600-605. 2 Celebrating Florida , Works of Art From the Vickers Collection , ed .
