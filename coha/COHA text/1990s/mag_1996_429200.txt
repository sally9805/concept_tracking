Sure it keeps bugs away , but does this toxic chemical belong on your skin ? The answer may surprise you . // Until the 1950s , mosquitoes buzzed through the backwoods with carefree abandon . Then one day , in a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory , a miracle molecule was born : N , N-diethyl-m-toluamide , more popularly known as DEET . This potent insect repellent was approved for consumer use in 1954 , and these days some 100 million Americans use it annually for the simple reason that nothing on the market out-repels DEET . End of success story ? Not quite because there 's another side to DEET that for years has helped create consumer fear and confusion . The federal Environmental Protection Agency classifies DEET as an insecticide , and anyone who has ventured into the great , bug-infested outdoors has heard tales of how the chemical can damage plastic and strip paint off a car . Then there are well-publicized medical cases . For instance , in 1979 the Journal of Pediatrics reported six DEET-related instances of children developing toxic encephalopathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three died . In Florida in 1985 , some Everglades National Park staffers soaked their uniforms in highconcentration DEET , and later reported severe headaches , insomnia , and incontinence , among other maladies . The state of New York even went so far as to ban repellents with DEET concentrations higher than 30 percent . The ban has since been repealed , but the state still advises that lower concentration formulas be used . " DEET is toxic , and it can be a poison , " warns Barbara Kennedy , M.D. , a Burlington , Vermont , pediatrician and member of the Wilderness Medical Society . " People need to know how to use it , especially around children . " And therein lies the confusion . Venture to any drug store or outfitter and you 'll find shelves full of repellents that contain DEET . It 's sold in a dizzying variety of strengths and formulations , from low concentrations intended for use at a backyard barbecue , to the more potent versions designed for places where insects descend on you in thick clouds . ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an analysis of the effectiveness of various repellents . ) So how do you know which strength is right for you ? I 've always answered that question with a simple , " None of them . " I 've never trusted such a potent chemical and have avoided using it all these years . Still , I could n't shake the fact that the stuff works far better than any natural repellent , so I decided to do some research . If you read the labels of DEETcontaining repellents , you 'll find an EPA-mandated " Hazards to Humans " cautionary statement . Depending on the amount of DEET or the concentration of the solvent ( such as ethanol or isopropanol ) used in the repellent , the caution will be in one of the following forms : A " Warning " is used for a Category 2 chemical , and means the product may cause cell damage , but that cells will return to normal within seven to 21 days . A " Caution " indicates the product may damage cells but that the cells will return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ( Category 4 ) . In case you 're wondering about Category 1 products , those are considered too dangerous and can not be sold . And all of these categories are based on eye tests conducted on animals . Most labels also warn against allowing high-concentration DEET formulas to come into contact with plastics , synthetics , leather , or painted surfaces because DEET can , indeed , damage such materials . Sound scary ? This kind of information makes you want to stay as far away from DEET as possible . Enter Lee Kaplan , M.D. " It 's remarkable how many people use DEET and how few reactions there are . " Kaplan is director of clinical dermatology at the University of California , San Diego , chief of dermatology at the V.A . Medical Center in San Diego , and an active member of the Wilderness Medical Society . To back up his contention , he points to data reported in a 1994 issue of Clinical Toxicology . According to the medical journal , from 1985 to 1989 poison control centers around the country received more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 99 percent of those reports turned out to be non-reactions or minor reactions , such as minor skin or eye irritation . Only five cases were deemed to be serious skin/eye irritations . There was only one death , and that was the result of someone committing suicide by ingesting 8 ounces of DEET . Furthermore , according to a 1989 EPA bulletin , the agency annually receives fewer than 10 reports of adverse side effects from DEET . Considering the 100 million people who use it each year , that translates to one person in 10 million who reports a problem . Most of those side effects result from repeated use on children , which even DEET manufacturers advise against . " There are so few reports of moderate and severe problems , when you consider the frequency of exposure , " Kaplan points out . Which does n't mean it 's suddenly OK to slather it all over yourself . According to Dr. Gerald Schoenig , a Charlottesville , Virginia , toxicologist , DEET still has the potential to create health problems . " There have been some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Schoenig , who is president of Toxicology/Regulatory Services . His firm has overseen EPA-regulated studies conducted for DEET 's major manufacturers . " In some of the cases of the children who died , their parents applied DEET heavily to the kids ' clothing and on their sheets at night . This is not the proper way to use DEET . " Schoenig says that when used according to manufacturers ' instructions , the chemical is safe . As further proof , he points to two extensive laboratory rat studies conducted by his company . " We put as much DEET on the animals as we could , to the point where it was literally running off them . Even at that point of saturation , we could n't produce any toxic signs , so we had to give it to them orally . " The rats remained healthy with no reduction in life span , and produced normal offspring that showed no effects from DEET exposure , not even low birth weight . None of the animals experienced reproductive problems , and there was no evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 percent decrease in the rats ' body weight . So where does all of this leave the consumer ? Well , you have Kaplan and his contention that DEET " does not deserve its bad name . " He 's joined by people like Kurt Avery , president of Sawyer Products , a manufacturer of DEET-based repellents located in Safety Harbor , Florida , who says " DEET is ... not absorbed into the skin as much as people think . Our position is that you do n't need to use that much DEET . " And here seems to lie the key to living with DEET . While it may not be the insidious chemical it has been made out to be , DEET is still potent and should be used with caution . This means that if the risk of infection from Lyme disease-carrying ticks or malariacarrying mosquitoes is low , you should consider reducing the concentration of DEET in your repellent . In fact , a good rule of thumb is to abide by the New York Department of Health 's recommendation : Stick with repellents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kids in particular need to be treated with caution , since they have a larger skin surface area in proportion to their mass than do adults , " says Kennedy . Even Kaplan and Schoenig advise that caution dictates using a lower concentration formula-no more than 10 percent , according to the American Academy of Pediatrics-on kids , unless disease-bearing pests are a real threat . Here are a few more guidelines : * Compared to aerosol sprays , lotions are easier to control and apply , plus you 'll do a better job of keeping DEET out of your eyes . If you must use a spray , apply to clothing only . * Apply only a thin layer of DEET lotion . Leave it on the surface , and do n't rub it into your skin . * If you are using sunscreen or other lotions along with DEET , apply them first . Putting DEET on the top layer means the chemical is less likely to be absorbed through your skin . * Do n't use DEET under clothing , where it 's in full contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower concentrations of DEET unless circumstances dictate otherwise . " I do n't like seeing products with 100 percent DEET , " says Kennedy . " Even adults do n't need that much . " * Never use DEET or any other repellent over cuts , wounds , or irritated skin . Keep it away from the eyes , mouth , and other sensitive areas . Flush DEET out of your eyes with water . * Once you 're indoors again , wash all DEET-treated areas of your skin with soap and water . Launder all DEET-treated clothing . * Kaplan recommends that on children , DEET should be used only " when you need to .... Apply to exposed skin or the cuffs and necklines of shirts . Do n't put it under clothing . " Do n't apply DEET to children 's hands because they tend to put their fingers in their mouths and will unwittingly swallow a trace of DEET in the process . When possible , dress children in long pants and long-sleeved shirts to minimize their exposure to biting insects . Keep all insect repellents out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . What 's safe for one person may harm another . If you or your child are among those who experiences dermatitis after using DEET , simply switch to a lower concentration formula and use it with more discretion . If the irritation persists , stop using the product . If you experience continued irritation , seek medical attention . By following these simple procedures , your risk from DEET will probably be much lower than the danger of disease from insects . Maybe at long last , more of us can comfortably live with this controversial chemical . Author Affiliation Michelle Kodis is a freelance writer in Telluride , Colorado . // <p>
