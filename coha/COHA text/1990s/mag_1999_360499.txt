Has the beleaguered American Medical Association made another dubious decision ? An AMA source says panic over potential wrath from Republicans was the prime reason for the firing last week of GEORGE LUNDBERG , 65 , longtime editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , who the AMA said was booted for " inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting JAMA into the middle of a debate that has nothing to do with science or medicine . " The sin ? Lundberg published a study  --  begun in 1991 , analyzed in ' 95 and presented to JAMA in late ' 98  --  on the attitudes of U.S. college students toward sex . Among the findings : 59% of the student group did not view a person who has had oral sex as having " had sex , " which could be seen as supportive of Bill Clinton . The firing is the latest in a string of controversies . In 1997 the AMA agreed to endorse Sunbeam medical equipment in what many saw as a conflict of interest . Last year it alienated conservatives by supporting a health-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer disparaged the group for interfering in the " inviolable ground of editorial independence " and said his client may sue . <P>  --  By Harriet Barovick/ New York and Dick Thompson/Washington
