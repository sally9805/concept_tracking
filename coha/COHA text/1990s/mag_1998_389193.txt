Section : Science &; ideas Advances in genetic engineering are spawning a new generation of powerful disease fighters <p> Dragging a child to get immunization shots can seem more a burden than a necessity to parents , especially when plagues like smallpox , polio , and diphtheria are fading fast from memory . In fact , Americans have become so blase about once widespread plagues that fewer than half of children under age 2 in the United States are fully vaccinated , and 70,000 people die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and hepatitis B. <p> Some parents view vaccines as old news , a throwback to the 1950s , when Salk and Sabin conquered polio . But they should think again . The science of immunology is on a fast track , thanks to advances in molecular biology and genetic research . The health benefits will be huge . Imagine childhood without the misery of strep throat and ear infections . AIDS fended off by a nose spray . Cancer reined in with a simple injection . This is what the world could be like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other major diseases , from diabetes to asthma , also are in the works . <p> In the past two months alone , researchers made strides toward preventing ills from such villains as pneumococcus bacteria , which causes meningitis and ear infections ; rotavirus , a key cause of childhood diarrhea and vomiting ; group A streptococcus , which causes strep throat and rheumatic fever ; and malaria , which sickens up to 500 million people a year . Last month , researchers announced that they had discovered how the hepatitis C virus , which has infected about 4 million people in the United States , penetrates human cells ; this paves the way for a vaccine to block that action . And earlier this month , scientists identified a particular kind of immune cell capable of protecting women from breast and ovarian cancer , a discovery likely to hasten the arrival of a cancer vaccine . The Institute of Medicine , part of the National Academy of Sciences , will attempt to bring order to the research frenzy next month by listing priorities for 21st-century vaccine development , including vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lean years . Today 's progress follows years of frustration . Knowledge garnered from Salk , Sabin , and other immunologists brought a dozen plagues under control by the mid-1970s , including rubella and whooping cough . But vaccines containing a " killed " virus  --  one that has been made inert by a chemical  --  were sometimes too weak to boost the body 's defenses sufficiently , and immunologists could not explain why . Other vaccines , such as Sabin 's polio vaccine and the first tuberculosis vaccine , contained live viruses that could win out over the immune system and cause fatal infections . By the early 1980s , the momentum had shifted from vaccines to disease-fighting drugs . <p> Two public-health scares revived the interest in vaccines . First was the emergence in the mid-1980s of new diseases such as AIDS and Lyme disease . Second was the realization that some disease organisms were evolving resistance to drugs as fast as scientists could invent new ones . <p> At the same time , scientists were gaining new understanding of the human immune system . Until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system , which relies on antibodies to seek out disease particles and destroy them before they invade the body 's cells . But the body also has a second line of defense . Two microbiologists  --  Peter Doherty , from Australia , and Rolf Zinkernagel , from Switzerland  --  won a Nobel Prize in 1996 for deciphering how that " cellular " immune system works . It relies on killer T cells , which seek body cells that have already been infected by a pathogen ( the term for a disease-causing organism ) . Killer T cells destroy infected cells to stop disease from spreading . The best vaccines , immunologists realized , would activate both lines of defense . <p> But that deeper understanding might never have yielded this new generation of vaccines without a technological revolution  --  the ability to make recombinant DNA . In the 1980s , molecular biologists figured out how to reassemble genetic material , making it possible to " genetically engineer " microorganisms  --  and vaccines . " Gene-based technology offers us tremendous reason to be optimistic about conquering even the most enigmatic diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) . <p> Since 1990 , hundreds of laboratories  --  run by NIAID , by academic institutions , and by nearly every pharmaceutical company in the country  --  have conducted thousands of studies to design new vaccines . Some focus on recombinant " subunit " vaccines , which only expose the body to antigens  --  the pieces of a pathogen that do not cause harm , but serve as ID badges to alert the immune system that the organism is dangerous . They inject antigen-producing genes into laboratory organisms , which serve as living factories to mass-produce the antigens . Others create harmless , hollow shells or protein clusters designed to look like a whole virus . <p> But the method generating the most enthusiasm is DNA vaccine . " When we first introduced the concept of DNA vaccines in 1992 , scientists considered it black magic and used words like ' cold fusion ' to dismiss it , " says Margaret Liu , a physician and immunologist with Chiron Corp. , a biotechnology firm in Emeryville , Calif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DNA snippets that instruct a cell to produce an antigen are injected directly into the body , the body 's own cells will take on the task of producing the antigen , and those antigens can prompt a strong killer T cell response . <p> Genetic manipulation allows researchers to finally overcome one of the biggest problems in creating vaccines : Common pathogens such as influenza and pneumococcal bacteria mutate so rapidly that it is difficult to design a vaccine to match the latest version . To outwit the bugs , researchers at Rockefeller University and Siga Pharmaceuticals Inc. , in New York , identified " conserved " proteins retained in all the 120 known strains of strep A. Strep infects up to 20 million people in the United States each year and is a major cause of childhood hospitalization . The scientists created a subunit vaccine by taking genetic coding for a surface protein shared by all strains and inserting it into harmless bacteria that live in the nose . A spray sends these bacteria into the nose , where they produce the foreign protein , spurring the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to parents will fight pneumococcal bacteria , a leading cause of childhood ear infections . Wesley Boodish , a pediatrician in Millburn , N.J. , ca n't wait to use it . One out of every three sick children in his waiting room has an ear infection . " Not only are they the most painful thing that affects a kid , but some kids are resistant to every drug we give them and have to have ear surgery . " The vaccine , which may be on the market by next July , will also help parents get more sleep and miss less work . AIDS <p> The most urgent priority among immunologists is AIDS . Although death rates have declined in the United States , the number of new infections , 40,000 a year , has not dropped . HIV infections have more than doubled since 1994 in many parts of Asia and Africa , where 90 percent of the world 's 30.6 million HIV-infected individuals live . <p> AIDS also is the toughest challenge immunologists have ever faced . Many vaccines , such as those for polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prompt an immune response . But since HIV destroys helper T cells , which rally killer T cells , a live HIV vaccine could cause a fatal infection . Progress also is slowed because there is no model of what an AIDS-proof immune system looks like . And once inside the body , HIV is extremely elusive , able to escape immune responses by mutating itself or by hibernating inside body cells . <p> But after years of false starts , researchers now say an AIDS vaccine is possible . " We wo n't have the perfect vaccine for AIDS available next year or the year after , but we will have vaccines that are at least partially effective within a decade , " says NIAID director Fauci . The first human trial of an experimental HIV vaccine began in 1987 , with more than 40 studies launched since . One vaccine , made by VaxGen Inc. , is in efficacy trials involving 5,000 volunteers in the United States and will soon be tested on 2,500 volunteers at 16 clinics in Thailand . <p> HIV is such a " clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising vaccines are those that use more than one method to spur an immune response . One such combination , now in development at Chiron , uses a " prime-boost " technique . First , the body is " primed " with a DNA " vector " vaccine , which employs a harmless virus  --  sometimes the same cowpox virus that Edward Jenner used against smallpox in the 18th century  --  that has been genetically altered to produce HIV antigens . The boost comes from a vaccine using a hollow HIV shell made of genetically engineered proteins . <p> A crucial effort against not only the HIV virus but against any disease that enters the body through respiratory , digestive , or reproductive pathways is that of stimulating " mucosal immunity . " Traditional vaccines act in the bloodstream , so that an immune response happens after the body has been infected . Mucosal vaccines , applied with a spray , might prevent infection altogether by stimulating immune cells that live in the nose , mouth , and genital tract . Experimental mucosal vaccines are showing promise against AIDS , flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would seem impossible to devise a cancer vaccine : Since cancer is the body 's own cells gone wild , anything that sparks an immune system response against cancerous cells would attack healthy ones , too . But cancer tumors , it turns out , do present antigens that differ from those on healthy cells . Vaccines that could rev up the immune system against tumor antigens would enable the body to reduce the size of a tumor or to wipe out groups of cancerous cells too small for clinicians to detect . Starting in the 1980s , scientists have been attempting to create three different types of cancer vaccines . The first uses whole or fragmented cancerous cells that have been removed from an individual 's body and manipulated in the lab to produce huge amounts of **25;1588;TOOLONG antigens . The antigens are then mixed with an adjuvant , a chemical solution that triggers the body to be more receptive  --  and responsive  --  to the antigens . The method works , but because a vaccine has to be tailor-made for each person , it 's too cumbersome for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new genetic coding into tumor cells inside the body , inducing them to produce more antigens  --  and prompt a greater immune response  --  than usual . The third approach identifies antigens from various tumor types , then injects either the DNA coding for those antigens or lab-made versions . But researchers still have n't identified which antigens provoke the strongest response . More than a dozen known antigens produced by prostate , breast , lung , and ovarian tumors are being scrutinized as potential vaccines . <p> But as with AIDS , cancer-vaccine work has been slowed because researchers could not find an example of a human immune system that had conquered cancer on its own . That changed this month , when a team led by Robert Darnell , head of the laboratory of molecular neurooncology at Rockefeller University , found that people whose bodies produce large amounts of a special killer T cell that attacks the " cdr2 " tumor antigen are immune to breast and ovarian cancer . " This is an important step forward because we now know that immunity to cancer does exist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Darnell . <p> The cdr2 antigen could be fed to dendritic cells , octopus-like scavengers in the cellular immune system that chew dead tumor cells to bits and parade the tumor antigens . This induces the production of killer T cells primed to target the tumor . Last year , researchers showed that it is possible to take dendritic cells from a person 's blood , clone them in the lab , and reinfuse them into the body . <p> Still , researchers are cautious about the usefulness of vaccines as a treatment for advanced cancers , saying they will work better against cancer in its early stages . Therapeutic vaccines to fight off the initial stages of several cancers are expected to be available within five years . Several melanoma vaccines are in the final stages of clinical testing ; safety trials are underway for vaccines against prostate and lung cancer ; and preliminary research in humans is showing promise against colon and stomach cancer . Preventive cancer vaccines for people who are healthy are not likely to be in wide use for at least 15 years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer , and  --  thanks to new delivery methods without needles  --  more comfortable . Some will come in the form of a mouthwash ; others will be swallowed in time-release microspheres , avoiding the need for boosters . Adhesive skin patches will release vaccines that seep into the bloodstream . Genetically altered foods such as potatoes and bananas will convey antigens  --  and immunity  --  against diseases such as cholera and are expected to be available in five years . Unlike live vaccines , these transgenic plant vaccines will not need refrigeration and will be easier to transport to the far reaches of the globe . If injection remains unavoidable , the pain involved will be lessened by new megavaccines that protect from seven diseases or more with a single shot . Several multivaccines are poised to come to market within two years ; further off are vaccines for autoimmune disorders such as juvenile diabetes , asthma , and multiple sclerosis . <p> Despite the tremendous progress , there will always be a need for newer and better vaccines . " We have to remember that disease critters were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after we 're gone , " says Henry Shinefield , codirector of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center . " They 've had far more time to learn to outwit enemies than we have . " If AIDS and cancer ever become just history , humans will undoubtedly be in the midst of fending off plagues unknown today . Vaccines in the works <p> HIV/AIDS . The virus no infects 30.6 million globally and strikes 16,000 daily . <p> Hepatitis C. Worldwide , 170 million carry the disease and are at risk for liver cancer . <p> Influenza . Flu kills 20,000 in the United States and infects 35 to 50 million a year . <p> STD . Genital herpes hits 500,000 Americans a year ; 60 million have it . <p> Asthma . Fifteen million Americans have asthma , which kills 5,000 each year . <p> Cancer . One in three Americans will get cancer , which killed 560,000 last year . <p> Strep throat . Americans contract 20 million cases a year ; it can become rheumatic fever . <p> Malaria . Globally , this parasite infects up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . <p> Ear infection . By age 3 , two thirds of all children have suffered from this painful condition . <p> Diabetes . The 16 million afflicted are prone to blindness , and kidney and heart problems . <p> MS . Multiple sclerosis , a crippling disease , affects 350,000 Americans . The new generation of vaccines <p> Traditional vaccines are made with weak or dead pathogens , but they can be risky or ineffective . Researchers are developing powerful new techniques to fight a variety of diseases . Here are some of the most promising methods : Pathogen <p> An organism that causes disease , such as a virus , bacterium , fungus , or parasite Antigen <p> A substance that prompts an immune response from the body . All pathogens wear antigens on their surface that identify them as foreign invaders . Recombinant subunit vaccines . A pathogen 's genes are inserted into cultured cells , which then produce antigens in massive quantities . These antigens are used as a vaccine in place of the whole pathogen . This method is being tested against malaria . Naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the body , where cells accept the added DNA instructions and make antigens that the body can recognize and fight . Naked DNA vaccines show promise against cancer . Reassortant virus vaccines . Genes from different strains of a pathogen are mixed to make a decoy virus that is armless but looks dangerous . A vaccine that employs this technology against rotavirus , a cause of diarrhea in children , will soon be on the market . Live vector vaccines . Genes from a dangerous virus , such as HIV , are inserted into a virus that is harmless to humans , such as the cowpox virus . The altered-but still harmless-virus invades the body and prompts a strong immune response . This shows promise against AIDS . Conjugate vaccines . Some bacterial antigens are not easily recognized by the body . To strengthen the immune response , easily recognizable antigens are joined with the antigens on a harmless bacterial shell . An experimental conjugate vaccine works well against a leading cause of ear infections in children . Painless delivery <p> Within a few years , receiving a vaccination may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace dreaded needle injections . Mucosal vaccines <p> By the fall of 2000 , a nasal spray to fight the flu in children as well as adults will be widely available . Today most children do not receive annual flu shots , even though they are the primary carriers of the virus . A spray for strep throat is also on the way . Edible vaccines <p> " Eat your vegetables " may soon take on a whole new meaning . Genetically engineered potatoes can provoke immune responses against diseases ranging from diarrhea to diabetes . Tomatoes and bananas also show promise . Skin patches <p> Just as some people wear nicotine adhesive skin patches to help them stop smoking , patches may soon be available that allow the skin to slowly absorb vaccines , warding off ills such as the flu and tetanus . Time-release pills <p> Vaccines coated in biodegradable " microspheres " can be taken in forms such as a pill or a spray . The slow-release microspheres may offer lifetime immunity to diseases in a single dose , eliminating the current need for boosters . <p> DIAGRAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joannie M. Schrof <p> Men and microbes DIVINING THE MYSTERIES OF IMMUNITY <p> " Why just think ? " Edward Jenner 's mentor admonished him . " Why not try the experiment ? " So in 1796 , Jenner , a surgeon , did , inoculating an 8-year-old boy against smallpox by infecting him with cowpox , a much less virulent virus . When he later exposed the boy to smallpox , the boy 's body successfully resisted it . Jenner 's discovery that it was possible to induce immunity to disease was initially discounted by physicians , but he soon was leading efforts to vaccinate across his native England . It was n't until the late 1870s , however , that people understood why vaccinations work . That 's when Louis Pasteur , a French chemist , discovered that cultivating a weakened , or attenuated , virus can make it confer immunity without causing severe illness . ( Jenner 's cowpox vaccine was a live virus . ) Pasteur went on to develop immunizations for animal diseases  --  chicken cholera , anthrax , and rabies  --  but it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on human vaccines . <p> Fighting flu . In the 1930s , scientists identified the viruses that cause yellow fever and influenza . Jonas Salk was among those who worked in the University of Michigan laboratories where the flu viruses were isolated . He later studied polio at the University of Pittsburgh . Salk developed his polio vaccine , made of a dead form of the virus , in the early 1950s ; it was declared effective and safe in 1955 , and widespread polio immunizations began shortly thereafter . Close on Salk 's heels was Polish-born Albert Sabin , who discovered that polio enters the body not through the nose and lungs , but instead primarily through the digestive system , and so developed a live-virus , oral vaccine more effective than Salk 's injections . Sabin 's oral vaccine was approved in 1960 , and by 1995 polio had been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere . Vaccines for measles , rubella , tetanus , diphtheria , and pertussis also are widely used . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Jonas Salk made history with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Jenne <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Louis Pasteur <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Albert Sabin <p> By Marissa Melton <p> Immunization roulette PARENTS WHO DO N'T VACCINATE PLAY A RISKY GAME <p> Dawn and Scott Richardson decided 2 1/2 years ago not to immunize their daughter Alexa with the standard round of vaccines for infants and toddlers . They first began to question the safety of vaccines when one of their cats went into shock following an immunization and had to be revived by the veterinarian . <p> But the moment they knew they were n't going to vaccinate their daughter was when they spoke to the parents of a 3-month-old baby , who died after receiving a series of immunizations . " The parents had not wanted to vaccinate , but the doctor convinced them , " Dawn says . " They went against their better judgment and the child ended up dying . " <p> In fact , deaths caused by vaccines are extremely rare , says Jon Abramson , chair of pediatrics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . In 1997 , 92 deaths in young children may have been caused by vaccines . The risk of a severe nonfatal reaction to vaccines , which usually contain live or weakened versions of the pathogen , is more common , but also small . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis ( DTP ) vaccine carries at worst a 1 in 100,000 chance of permanent brain damage . <p> Stephen Mulhauser was 3 1/2 months old when he received his second DTP shot . He began shrieking a few hours later . This lasted 9 1/2 hours . He also developed a high fever . After a few days , his eyes started wandering independently of each other , and he stopped playing with his toys . Stephen is now 16 years old and lives with his family in New York City . He has profound hearing loss and multiple disabilities , and he has difficulty feeding and dressing himself . " What really bothers me is that I thought I was protecting him by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " says his mother , Linda . <p> Health experts say the 1 percent of parents who do n't vaccinate their children are not protecting them . " This is flawed and truncated reasoning , " says Louis Sullivan , former secretary of health and human services . A child exposed to measles is much more likely to suffer complications from the disease than from the vaccine . According to the CDC , a child has a 1 in 2,000 chance of suffering encephalitis , which causes fever and transient mental disorientation , from the measles , compared with the 1 in a million chance of suffering encephalitis from the vaccine . <p> Outbreaks . The odds are greater that a child will not be exposed to diseases when most other children are vaccinated , but the possibility exists . Such was the case in the early 1990s , when cities throughout the United States were hit with measles outbreaks , killing nine children in Philadelphia and at least 12 people in Dallas . This year , outbreaks of whooping cough have been reported in California in children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a risk is " a reality we all have to confront , " Sullivan says . Scientists still do n't know why immunizations go wrong but are trying to reduce the risk . A safer " acellular " pertussis vaccine that contains less of the virus than the original whole-cell version is now available . And parents are increasingly opting for an injectable , inactivated form of polio vaccine , rather than the live oral-dosage form that can cause paralysis . Big shots <p> The CDC recommends these vaccines by age 6 : TABLE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dawn and Scott Richardson at home with their daughter Alexa <p> By Stacey Schultz <p> Around the world TOO MANY CHILDREN , NOT ENOUGH VACCINE <p> While diseases such as polio , measles , rubella , and diphtheria are practically unknown in the United States , parents in developing nations still lose children to these preventable diseases . Countries in the former Soviet Union have reported 1,700 cases of diphtheria so far this year , after a 1995 outbreak that sickened 50,000 and took up to 2,500 lives . Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the illness for 46 deaths . The reason for these outbreaks , and others , is simple : failure to vaccinate children . <p> But solving the problem is not so simple . Although immunization rates have risen dramatically worldwide in the past 18 years  --  up from 5 percent of children in developing nations in 1980 to an average of 80 percent today  --  reaching the remaining children is a formidable task . <p> Many of the obstacles are logistical . If people living at the top of a mountain in Nepal need booster shots , someone has to climb the mountain to administer them , explains Mathuram Santosham , professor of international health and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore . Motorbikes have to be available and gassed up to get vaccines out to many rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa . And vaccines are perishable commodities ; they must be kept cool from the time they 're manufactured until they 're administered . If the " cold chain " is broken , the vaccine becomes useless . <p> Remote and expensive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive it is to do so . With the exception of the poorest countries  --  which receive help from international health agencies  --  governments generally pay for immunization programs . They must compete for funds with issues like housing and sanitation , pressing needs in the tightly packed , disease-prone conditions of poor urban areas . Newer vaccines like the one for rotavirus , which causes deadly diarrhea in infants , are still fairly scarce and expensive . <p> And many people avoid having their children vaccinated . Some do so because they see that children sometimes become ill after receiving live or attenuated vaccines , not understanding that the illnesses are far milder than they would have been without vaccines . Religious beliefs deter others . And many of the urban poor are illegal refugees or aliens , who are loath to identify themselves to any government program . <p> Public health officials say the benefits of world vaccination efforts outweigh the considerable cost . Not only does universal vaccination benefit poverty-stricken developing nations , it also stops the spread of disease back into industrialized countries .
