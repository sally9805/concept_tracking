The professor removes his tweed jacket , hangs it on the back of a chair and prepares to teach what is widely acknowledged to be unteachable . Things are going well for him . His big new novel , Cloudsplitter ( HarperCollins ; 758 pages ; $27.50 ) , about the raging , God-haunted 19th century abolitionist John Brown , is about to hit the bookstores , and he has learned this very day that director Atom Egoyan 's movie of his novel The Sweet Hereafter has earned two Academy Award nominations . Another film , drawn from his novel Affliction and starring Nick Nolte , is ready for distribution . He smiles . Equal to equal , a diamond stud in his left ear glinting encouragingly , he addresses the 11 Princeton freshmen and sophomores in this creative-writing seminar as " writers . " <P> On the blackboard , he chalks the elements of a short story : " character , language , situation , structure , plot . " He does not add " drugs , booze , angry sex , bar fighting , class resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord this country music on their own . Or not . Now they seem shy and tentative . The professor tries to loosen them up : " A good writer steals from other writers , " he says . " Got to be willing to steal , to pillage . " Got to be willing , Russell Banks might say to himself , to be merely very good in novel after novel while critics use words like talented and valuable and consign you to the respectable second rank . <P> Being a promising writer at 57 may keep you young  --  there 's that diamond stud . But beyond the extra dollars , " breaking through " at that age , as it seems likely that Banks has done with the monolithic and masterly Cloudsplitter , may be worth little more than a wry smile . In any case , it has been a long wait and a hard climb . When Banks was the age of his students , he was a plumber in Concord , N.H. , working construction . Plumbing was how the Banks men , his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college ( Colgate , on a full scholarship ) but had busted out after a few months with a case of what he calls " turbulence . " By 19 he had married . By 20 he had fathered a child and would soon be divorced . ( He has been married for nine years to his fourth wife , poet Chase Twichell . ) He had written a novel , not published , and had run off to fight for Castro ( not quite getting there ; instead dressing mannequins for a department store in Lakeland , Fla . ) . Before this , at 16 , he had stolen a car and Kerouacked off to California . Earlier still , he had learned to keep his head down ; his father , a wife-beating alcoholic who " pretty much abandoned the family " when Russell was 12 , sometimes took swipes at his kids .
