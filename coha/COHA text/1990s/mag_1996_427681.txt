Section : Further Reading <p> Great groups have shaped our world , from the gathering of young geniuses at Los Alamos who unleashed the atom , to the youthful scientists and hackers who invented a computer that was personal as well as powerful . That should hardly surprise us . In a society as complex and technologically sophisticated as ours , the most urgent projects require the coordinated contributions of many talented people . Whether the task is building a global business or discovering the mysteries of the human brain , one person ca n't hope to accomplish it , however gifted or energetic he or she may be . And yet , even as we make the case for collaboration , we resist the idea of collective creativity . Our mythology refuses to catch up with our reality . And so we cling to the myth of the Lone Ranger , the romantic idea that great things are usually accomplished by a larger-than-life individual working alone . <p> Given our continuing obsession with solitary genius , reflected in everything from the worship of film directors to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no surprise that we tend to underestimate just how much creative work is accomplished by groups . Today an important scientific paper may represent the best thinking and patient lab work of hundreds of people . Collaboration constantly takes place in the arts as well . A classic example is the Michelangelo masterpiece , the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel . In our mind 's eye , we see Michelangelo , looking remarkably like Charlton Heston , laboring alone on the scaffolding high above the chapel floor . In fact , 13 people helped paint the work . Michelangelo was not only an artist ; he was , as biographer William E. Wallace points out , the head of a good-sized entrepreneurial enterprise . <p> We must turn to great groups if we hope to begin to understand how that rarest of precious resources  --  genius  --  can be successfully combined with great effort to achieve results that enhance all our lives . It is in such groups that we may also discover why some organizations seem to breed greatness , freeing members to be better than anyone imagined they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a paradox , really , because great groups tend to be collegial and nonhierarchical , peopled by singularly competent individuals who often have an anti-authoritarian streak . Nonetheless , virtually every great group has a strong and visionary head . First off , each leader has a keen eye for talent . Recruiting the right genius for the job is the first step in building many great collaborations . The groups ' leaders are almost always pragmatic dreamers . The dream is always one of greatness , not simply an ambition to succeed . The dream is the engine that drives the group , the vision that inspires the team to work as if the fate of civilization rested on their completing their project . <p> Many great groups have a dual administration . They have a visionary leader , and they have someone who protects them from the outside world . Great groups tend to be nonconformist . People in them are always rule busters , never insiders or corporate types on the fast track . People in great groups are always on their own track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the criticism but even the attention of the bureaucrats and conventional thinkers elsewhere in the organization . The protectors typically lack the glamour of the visionary leaders , but they are no less essential , particularly in enterprises that require official sanction or that can not realize their dream without institutional consent . <p> Who becomes part of a great group ? If not out-and-out rebels , participants may lack traditional credentials or exist on the margins of their professions . They are almost always young . Probably the most important thing that young members bring is their often delusional confidence . Thus , many great groups are fueled by an invigorating , completely unrealistic view of what they can accomplish . Not knowing what they ca n't do puts everything in the realm of the possible . Great groups often show evidence of collective denial . And " Denial ai n't just a river in Egypt , " as 12-steppers like to say . Denial can obscure obstacles and stiffen resolve . It can liberate . Great groups are not realistic . They are exuberant and irrationally optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkerers . There 's a joke about engineers that captures the spirit of many participants in creative collaborations : An engineer meets a frog , who offers the engineer anything he wants if he will kiss the frog . " No , " says the engineer . " Come on , " says the frog . " Kiss me , and I 'll turn into a beautiful woman . " " Nah , " says the engineer . " I do n't have time for a girlfriend ... but a talking frog , that 's really neat . " <p> Curiosity fuels every great group . The members do n't simply solve problems . They are engaged in a process of discovery that is its own reward . Many of the people in these groups have dazzling individual skills . But they also have another quality that allows them both to identify significant problems and to find creative , boundary-busting solutions rather than simplistic ones : they have hungry , urgent minds . <p> Virtually every great group defines itself in terms of an enemy . Sometimes the enemy is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But more often , the chief function of the enemy is to solidify and define the group itself . In great groups the engagement of the enemy is both dead serious and a lark . Great groups always see themselves as winning underdogs , wily Davids toppling the bloated Goliaths of tradition and convention . <p> People in great groups often seem to have struck a Faustian bargain , giving up their normal lives , if not their souls , in exchange for greatness . Because they are mission maniacs , obsessed with the project at hand , relationships outside the group routinely suffer . <p> Although great groups experience their moments of near despair , they are more often raucous with laughter . Creative collaborators become members of their own tribe , with their own language , in-jokes , dress , and traditions . <p> Great groups often fall apart when the project is finished . Why do these often short-lived associations burn so bright in the memories of former members ? There are a host of reasons . Life in the group is often the most fun members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exercising all their wits in the company of people " used to dealing lightning with both hands , " as one great-group member put it . Communities based on merit and passion are rare , and people who have been in them never forget them . And then there is the sheer exhilaration of performing greatly . Talent wants  --  and needs  --  to exercise itself . <p> People pay a price for their membership in great groups . Postpartum depression is often fierce , and the intensity of collaboration is a potent drug that may make everything else , including everything after , seem drab and ordinary . <p> But no one who has participated in one of these adventures in creativity and community seems to have any real regrets . How much better to be with other worthy people , doing worthy things , than to labor alone . In a great group you are liberated for a time from the prison of self . As part of the team , you are on leave from the mundane  --  no questions asked  --  with its meager rewards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to exercise it in a dance with others is rarer still . Karl Wallenda , the legendary tightrope walker , once said , " Being on the tightrope is living ; everything else is waiting . " Most of us wait . In great groups talent comes alive . <p> By Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman <p> <p> From the forthcoming book Organizing Genius : The Secrets of Creative Collaboration , ( <p>
