<p> They 're in short supply . They 're hard to find . And Mark McFadden knows he 's got to be fast and ruthless if he 's going to snag one . <p> A cocktail party invitation means a race to the phone to book one before his neighbors do . Early November means it 's time to lock them in for those Christmas parties . And he 's always on the prowl for naive parents who will give up the goods and reveal the ones they use  --  something he never does . You 've got to do whatever it takes , McFadden will tell you , to find and keep that babysitter . <p> " If it 's someone really reliable , I 'm not going to give their name out to someone else , " he said . " When we all work so hard , we want to play hard once in a while . You ca n't play if you ca n't find adequate coverage for your kids . " <p> The Washington area is struggling with a shortage of teenage baby-sitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they ca n't find one . <p> Among the reasons : A decline in the population of older teenagers has come just as a baby boomlet has yielded more children who need watching . And parents say teenagers are busier now with after-school activities . Girls , for example , have more opportunities to play organized sports . <p> Although it seemed that practically every block had eager child-minding girls in decades past , parents now say they hoard phone numbers of their best sitters and keep them even from their friends . They book sitters sometimes months in advance and practically bribe them with food and other perks . It 's a seller 's market , with prices hitting $ 7.50 to $ 10 an hour in some neighborhoods . <p> McFadden , of Alexandria , entices teenagers to look after his 7- and 9-year-old sons by trying to make the job sound like a mini-vacation . He 'll tell them that he 's got a Blockbuster movie and that all they have to do is watch it with the children . You want to surf the Net ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 15 times a year , he and his wife come up empty and have to cancel plans . <p> " You 've got to make it really attractive for the babysitter , " McFadden said . " It 's a competition to get them . These kids have a lot of choices . " <p> Busy professionals even have been rearranging work schedules around their sitters ' plans . Jean McGillen , the executive director of a group that fixes up apartment buildings for low- and moderate-income people in Arlington , frequently has difficulty finding someone to watch the children so she can attend evening meetings with her board of directors . Her solution : first find out when her sitter is free , then call her board to change the meeting to that night . <p> Demographic change explains part of the scramble , says Harold Hodgkinson , director of the Center for Demographic Policy in Washington . Low birth numbers in the late 1970s and early 1980s mean there are relatively fewer older teenagers . Couple that with a large number of children from a recent birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decreased supply . <p> In 1980 , there were 33 million people younger than 10 , while those ages 15 to 19  --  prime baby-sitting ages  --  numbered 21 million . By 1996 , the population younger than 10 had climbed to 38 million , while the number of older teenagers had dropped to 18.6 million , according to U.S. Census data . <p> In addition , parents and others involved with babysitters throughout the area say teenage girls start baby-sitting sooner and quit much earlier than in past generations . High school students now cram in more activities after school and have more job alternatives , meaning there 's less time for a teenager to baby-sit . <p> Joanne Steller , of Chevy Chase , says that 's the case for Katie , her 13-year-old daughter , who plays soccer , swims and takes piano lessons . This summer , Katie baby-sat almost every weekend and could have " baby-sat every day of her life " if she took all the offers that came her way . But Steller is going to have Katie scale back her child-watching duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a kid involved in soccer with practices two to three times week , that makes them unavailable for baby-sitting , " said Steller , who baby-sat all through high school in the 1960s . " When I was in school , girls were not involved in sports . If you have an athletic daughter , you want them to take advantage of it . " <p> One bright spot is that some boys have joined the pool of babysitters . But they , too , have scheduling problems because of sports and after-school jobs . And in any case , many parents prefer to hire girls . <p> Because baby-sitting is such a localized enterprise , the overall shortage has n't hit all neighborhoods equally . Some tightknit communities with lots of teenagers have n't felt the pinch . But the problem is at its worst in many town house communities where young parents and small children dominate . <p> The crunch has prompted schools and other institutions to adapt . <p> Patrick Henry Elementary School in Arlington began offering baby-sitting several years ago at parent-teacher association meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with children and complaining that they could n't find anyone to mind them . <p> The Birchmere music club in Alexandria has moved show times progressively earlier in the last few years , from 9 p.m. to 7:30 p.m . Michael Jaworek , the club 's promoter , figures parents will have an easier time finding sitters if they 're getting home earlier from a show . <p> Patricia Keener , a pediatrician in Indianapolis who founded a nationwide training program for babysitters in 1980 , remembers when it was n't like that . <p> " It used to be that the mother would call up the day she wanted a sitter , and the sitter came over , " Keener said . " Now , there are all these elaborate plans . . . . And pity the poor mother who does n't have a sitter by Wednesday for a Friday . " Her nonprofit program , Safe Sitter , offers classes at Washington area hospitals from Leesburg to Bethesda . <p> For some families , finding a sitter is complicated further because parents are getting pickier . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry that they do n't know the local teenagers well enough . <p> Kathy Hedrick , who lives in western Prince William County , hires a day-care worker who looks after her 2- and 5-year-old daughters to baby-sit on evenings and weekends  --  something her day-care center says has become common . When she heard that a teenager in her neighborhood looked after children , she could n't bring herself to leave her children with her . She said she would have worried too much . <p> All that means the relatively few experienced teenagers who baby-sit are hot commodities . Kerry Ross , 16 , of Arlington , says for every Friday and Saturday night , she has 10 to 15 parents pleading with her to come over . If parents want to ensure a spot on her calendar , they need to reserve her three to four weeks in advance , especially for big local events such as back-to-school nights . <p> " I work on a first-come , first-served basis . I do n't double-book , " said the seasoned business operator , who tells parents they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cancellation . Regularly rejecting adults can be hard , she says . " It 's very uncomfortable sometimes . You feel downright bad telling them that you are already booked . " <p> Amber Earp , 16 , of Woodbridge , really gets busy in the fall and winter . That 's when all the military families in her neighborhood start heading out to the Army Ball and other holiday parties . A client once asked her in September to baby-sit on New Year 's Eve . And one day after Christmas last year , she did four baby-sitting jobs , a day that started at 7 a.m. and ended at 1 a.m . <p> The fortunate parents who are able to land a sitter also have been hit with sticker shock . Forget the days when you could find one for 50 cents an hour and expect them to clean the house . Today 's teenagers routinely charge $ 4 to $ 5 an hour and expect to be fed . <p> In more affluent areas such as Bethesda and Alexandria , some parents are paying $ 7.50 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hard to get sitters to come over . The reason : They do n't really need the money . David Gordon , who lives in upper Northwest Washington , says that in moments of desperation he 's called 15-year-olds who usually charge $ 6 an hour and offered more . <p> " They 'll say , ' I do n't know , I have a lot of homework , ' " said Gordon , who then will offer $ 8 an hour . " Finally they 'll say , ' Oh all right , ' as if they 're doing you a favor . " <p> In addition to hiring moonlighting day-care workers , parents are resorting to other adult alternatives to teenage help . <p> Mothers ' Aides , a Fairfax Station company that provides adult sitters , has doubled its business from a couple of years ago . About 150 to 200 parents use the service each week . But this route can get expensive . The more mature caretakers cost about $ 8 to $ 10 an hour , and there 's a minimum four-hour charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 25 if it 's a last-minute booking . <p> Those who ca n't afford such rates say the shortage of low-cost teenage sitters means they do n't go out . Or they take the children along . <p> And those who have a good sitter do everything they can to hang on to them . Diana Bradley , of Lake Ridge , always remembers to get her sitters birthday and holiday gifts . Still , she knows they 'll eventually leave her . <p> " I 'm always on the lookout , " Bradley said . " It 's all about networking . People network for a job . You need to network to find a good sitter . "
