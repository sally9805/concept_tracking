<p> When 12-year-old Gabriel won third place for his tornado-in-a-bottle science project , Eugene Helm IV jumped to his feet and erupted in joy . <p> The four other children roared , too . Then , wanting to be part of the action , 11-year-old Randy looked at Eugene and blurted , " I 'm almost finished with MY science project ! " <p> Just months before , Gabriel - a bully at school who wore gang-style clothes - would laugh out loud when handed back a failed assignment . But here he was on stage , gripping a trophy and basking in the applause , while Eugene beamed from the audience . <p> " You could see , ME , like a proud father , " Eugene said , shaking his head incredulously . <p> In fact , Eugene is not the father of these five children - three boys and twin girls . He is their uncle . <p> And therein lies a very unusual Father 's Day story - the story of how Eugene Helm IV became an instant father , putting aside his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh to harbor dreams . <p> Just a year ago , Eugene was a 25-year-old college student in Chicago , thinking of little else than organic chemistry , his job as a pharmacy assistant at a drugstore and his fiancee , Taneen . <p> His mother 's death last July changed all that : It left homeless the five grandchildren she had been raising . <p> Quite honestly , Eugene had n't given the youngsters much thought . He had come to Dallas to bury his mother and be on his way . He figured the kids - boys aged 7 , 11 and 12 and 4-year-old twin girls - would be farmed out to relatives or foster care . <p> No one could blame him for going back to Chicago . He was a college student pursuing a career as a pharmacist and looking forward to a $ 60,000 salary . And there was his girlfriend . The week before his mother died , Taneen had mapped out their future - and that included three kids , tops . <p> Eugene would be out of his mind to even consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't expect him to stay . Relatives had told them " Mr. Preppy " was leaving . <p> Even at their young ages , they were used to that . The boys ' mother had died and the girls ' mother had been in and out of jail on drug charges . Eugene did n't even know who the children 's fathers were . <p> But when he looked into their innocent faces , he saw his sisters . If he walked away , he worried the children would end up just like them - dead or addicted . <p> He toured the west Dallas housing projects where the twins were staying , and found the buildings soul-deadeningly grim . A relative who volunteered to take the boys never showed to pick them up . And Eugene got the feeling that some of the relatives just wanted the kids for their welfare benefits . Others , he knew , were drug abusers . <p> " What do I do ? What do I do ? , " Eugene asked himself . " I 've got a good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket back to Chicago . <p> Eugene had a lot waiting for him there . As a teen-ager , he had moved there to live with his father . Crime was taking over his south Dallas neighborhood and his older brother was in prison . Eugene 's grades were so bad as a high school freshman that he was disqualified from playing after-school sports . His mother believed he needed a male role model and sent him packing . <p> " Son , " his father told him when he arrived , " I want you to do something with yourself . " <p> He did . He was elected to his high school 's student council and made the National Honor Society . <p> His father brimmed with pride when Eugene announced his plans to become a pharmacist , just like him . Eugene had nearly finished his college prerequisites to apply for pharmacy school when he was called to Dallas for the funeral . <p> When he saw the bleak future facing his nieces and nephews , he could n't so easily turn his back . <p> He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college to raise the five kids . <p> " Your mom would be proud , " his father said quietly . <p> " Dad , what about you , man ? " <p> With his father torn by his high expectations for his son , Eugene knew the decision was his alone . <p> " What kind of man would I be to abandon my family ? " he asked himself . <p> He scrapped the bus ticket and moved into his mother 's apartment with the kids and his sister , who had been out of jail since the funeral but was tethered to the courts by an electronic monitoring device on her ankle . <p> Life had been so hard on these children . The boys had been at the deathbeds of their mother , who died of tuberculosis , and their grandmother , who died after an asthma attack . <p> Gabriel and Randy , the oldest , were tough guys , bullies at school . They wore their pants slung low around their hips and baseball caps cocked at an angle . At the tender age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eugene knew they 'd be in gangs for sure , if he did n't do something . <p> Darnisha and LaEunice , the twins , had been shuttled among relatives as their mother went in and out of prison . Once , they barely escaped a fire when a Molotov cocktail was thrown into their grandmother 's apartment by drug dealers looking for their mother . Another time , they told Eugene , they had watched their mother stab their father . <p> " It was n't about me anymore , " Eugene said . " It took a lot of humility ... to search inside to find strength and ask God , ' Is this really what you want me to do ? ' " <p> Three months later , Eugene and the kids were evicted from the apartment when they could n't pay back rent . <p> His sister , Kim , quickly qualified to move into an apartment for ex-convicts and their families run by Exodus , a private , nonprofit organization . Since Eugene was neither husband nor father , he could n't stay with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned him enough to buy a $ 500 car at auction , so he lived out of that for a few weeks . <p> But when Kim started having trouble raising the kids and could n't get them to school on time , Exodus asked Eugene to move in and help . Then came another blow : Within a week , Kim failed a random drug test and was kicked out . <p> Exodus administrators offered to find foster homes for the children , but again , Eugene said no . They were his responsibility . Exodus director Debbie Rouse was so impressed that she invited him to stay . <p> But what did Eugene know about raising kids ? The closest he had come was volunteering to help with a church youth program . And here he was fixing up the girls ' hair , helping the boys with homework and taking them all to church on Sundays . <p> " I can do this , " he told himself . <p> He got a new job across town as a pharmacy assistant at a drugstore but , within weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus - four of them each way . <p> That meant rising at 4:30 a.m. , waking the boys , then the girls , picking up around the apartment and sitting down for morning prayer . They 'd be out of the house by 7 a.m. - the boys on the way to school , the girls to a Head Start program , and Eugene on his two-hour bus ride to get to work by 9 a.m . <p> He missed Taneen terribly , but could n't bear to call her . Their conversation the week before his mother died rang in his ears . " We have no kids , " she had told him . " We can do so much together . " <p> What would he say to her ? I have five kids , no money and I 'm living in a housing project for ex-cons ... will you still marry me ? He could n't ask that of her . <p> Instead , he concentrated on the children ; they needed love , religion and self-esteem . After homework and dinner , he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth and taught it to the children : " Good , better , best , never let it rest , ' til the good get better and the better get best . " <p> After the girls gradually became more sociable in the Head Start program , teachers asked Eugene for his secret . The boys started doing better in school and made the honor roll . Gabriel took home that science fair trophy . <p> But amid the rewards , Eugene was still overwhelmed by the sheer chaos of parenting . Just one example : He had to take unpaid time off when the girls got sick with chicken pox and when they had dentist appointments . <p> It was November when Taneen finally tracked Eugene down . She had tried calling him at Exodus , but her messages never reached him . <p> Finally , she got a list of the chain of drugstores Eugene worked for and started at the top . On the fourth try , she found him . <p> " Eugene ! " she squealed into the phone . <p> " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon softened . <p> She did n't care about the five kids or the apartment for ex-cons . She wanted to be with the man she loved and respected now more than ever , the man who took her to church on their first date and proposed after midnight Mass at Christmas two years earlier . <p> " I love you , " she told him . " I do n't care . " <p> She bought a bus ticket and asked God to bless the trip . <p> When she met the children , she fell in love . Gabriel and Randy insisted on accompanying her on a walk to the store . <p> " You 're not from here , " they said . " We have to protect you . " <p> They were meant to be a family , Taneen thought . She and Eugene set a July wedding date . They would just put their other goals and dreams on hold . For now , their priority was on raising these children in a warm , loving home . <p> In the meantime , The Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-page story about him . Within days , thousands of letters , checks and offers of cars poured into Exodus , care of Eugene Helm . <p> More than $ 80,000 stacked up , including $ 5,000 from Black Entertainment Television . <p> " There 's been a stereotype of the black man of always being on drugs and all the other things , " said Curtis Symonds , BET executive vice president of sales and marketing . " This is the kind of uplifting story that there are role models out there that are doing the right thing . " <p> Eugene and Taneen moved their wedding date up and were married in April . He is taking the summer off so his new wife and family can get to know each other . Already , the kids are calling Taneen " momma-auntie " ; they call Eugene " unkie " or " dad . " <p> Eugene hopes to go back to school soon and Taneen wants to complete her teaching degree , but those plans may have to be put on hold . <p> Exodus has handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65,000 with a district court to determine how it should be distributed . Exodus lawyer Braden Sparks says the twins ' mother and other relatives , including fathers , could make a claim on the money . <p> And then there 's the paternity suit filed by a woman who claims that Eugene , at age 14 , fathered her daughter . The woman had sued a year earlier in Chicago , but the case was dismissed . After the story about him was published , she filed again in Dallas . <p> A judge issued a $ 19,000 judgment against Eugene for back child support when he missed a court hearing . He appealed and was granted a new trial set for July . A genetic screening test also has been ordered . <p> If the child is his , Eugene says , he will take care of her . <p> In the meantime , the family of seven has moved out of Exodus and into a modest two-bedroom apartment . They have turned a sun room into a bedroom for the girls , who are enrolling in dance classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are registered for basketball camp . <p> Eugene feels blessed . <p> " God allowed me to be with the woman I love dearly , " he said , " and to give these kids a better life .
