You would n't have thought it , but in his 1998 documentary Cold War , Sir Jeremy Isaacs had it easy . In that show , he could impress the viewer with bombshells ( real ones ) ; in Millennium ( CNN , Sundays through Dec. 12 , 10 p.m . E.T. ) , he has to astonish us with what we already know . This 10-hour , chronological series does n't always succeed , but at its best , its hyper welter of history renders the familiar surprising . <P> Millennium hopscotches the world in vignettes , making regions characters in a global mini-series ( and paying ample attention to non-Western areas ) . It eschews Ken Burnsian still lifes for a tarantella of computer animation , film clips , re-enactments and folk performances , whirling impatiently like the dervishes and dancers it uses to maximum effect . This mix can shock us into seeing the present in the past , as when Isaacs crosscuts modern Italian hipsters and preening Renaissance Florentines . The conventional re-enactments , however , are like a forced march to colonial Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one wishes for more interpretation and overarching narrative  --  a history of ideas atop the history of events . There are a couple of implicit morals . The first is that cultures that turned inward , notably China ( the breakout star of the show , with an apparent big role in the sequel ) , have not fared so well as those that were outward looking , even imperialist . The second is that the era 's driving force , for good and for ill , is human arrogance . This millennium is a graveyard of eternal empires , authoritative explanations and overreaching ambitions that  --  like Isaacs '  --  every so often manage to show us something new under the sun . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
