<p> THE North Atlantic Treaty Organization defeated its Soviet enemy without firing a shot , earning the reputation as one of the most successful military alliances in history . <p> After the end of the cold war , some argued that NATO should disband . But today , NATO is newly robust . The 60,000-strong peace implementation force ( IFOR ) deploying in Bosnia is the biggest mission in the history of the alliance . <p> NATO has long played a role in supporting peace . Some say NATO 's real achievement in the past 46 years is that there has n't been a war between any of its members - especially France and Germany , which had competed to dominate the Continent until World War II . <p> What is NATO and how does it relate to Americans ? <p> NATO is a 16-member military alliance consisting of the United States , Canada , and 14 European nations from Iceland to Turkey . During the cold war , the nations of the democratic West used NATO to organize their defense against possible invasion from the communist East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forum in Europe for handling transatlantic security . NATO is what makes the United States a European power . And just as the two world wars bound earlier generations of Americans to Europe in a very personal way , so NATO has tied Americans to Europe in the years since . The American commitment to NATO has brought 15 million Americans and their families over the years to serve in Germany , where the vast majority of US military personnel have been stationed for NATO . The US presence in Europe , now at about 100,000 troops , is about one-third of its cold-war peak . <p> What does NATO commit its member nations to do ? <p> Under the Treaty of Washington - the basis for NATO that was signed April 4 , 1949 - NATO members agreed that an armed attack against one would be considered an attack on all . <p> But the treaty 's careful wording gives some latitude in the response to such an attack . Members agreed that each of them would assist an attacked party or parties individually or collectively , " including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security of the North Atlantic area . " <p> How does an international organization of 16 member states operate ? <p> Each member nation 's vote carries the same weight as another 's . But there is no mistaking the dominant American presence in NATO . " NATO works with American leadership , " said one diplomat recently . The military commander of the alliance is always American ; the secretary-general is always European . <p> NATO sets its budget by means of a two-year planning exercise , in which each member submits its military budget and defense plans for review by the group . The US contributes roughly a quarter of the cost of the alliance . <p> What is the Partnership for Peace ( PFP ) ? <p> Launched at the Brussels summit in January 1994 , the PFP is NATO 's , and particularly the Clinton administration 's , attempt to beef up the security of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet empire . NATO promises to " consult " PFP members that perceive a direct threat to their territorial integrity , political independence , or security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full NATO membership . For others , PFP is an end in itself . <p> Who belongs to PFP ? <p> Twenty-six Eurasian countries that fall into several groups : Neutral nations interested in peacekeeping ( e.g. , Sweden ) ; nations once controlled by the Soviet Union that want to join NATO as soon as possible ( e.g. , Poland ) ; former Soviet-controlled nations that want to join but are less ready to do so ( e.g. , Bulgaria ) ; and former Soviet republics that have n't expressed interest in NATO membership . <p> What is PFP doing ? <p> Each partner country has its own program for working with NATO : Taking part in joint military exercises and peacekeeping or consulting on budgeting are some examples . All partners aspiring to join NATO are participating in IFOR in the hopes that this will speed their applications . Some criticize PFP for emphasizing military exercises over political issues , such as the need for Europe 's emerging democracies to better their record on human rights . <p> So where is Russia in all this ? <p> Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . <p> Most observers view Russia 's contribution of troops to NATO 's Bosnia mission positively and no longer view Russia as a territorial danger . But the country is unstable and militarily strong enough to scare its neighbors . <p> NATO and other sources insist that the alliance and Russia need to define a " special relationship . " Such an agreement needs to take into consideration the Eastern Europeans ' fears of being invaded by Russia or abandoned by the West . <p> America 's political landscape : <p> The Clinton administration has favored enlargement of NATO . NATO is popular with Republicans , too , and the Contract With America calls for enlarging NATO . During the 1996 presidential campaign , both Republicans and Democrats may well call for NATO enlargement to appeal to Polish-American , Hungarian-American , and other ethnic voters in swing electoral states . <p> But a treaty on enlarging NATO could face obstacles in the Senate , since that would commit the US to defending more territory than Americans may be prepared to protect . The answer to the question " Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , is not fully clear . <p> NATO and Americans : <p> Polling data suggest that American popular support for NATO remains strong . Modest majorities favor expanding NATO , even to include Russia . People may see NATO less as a defensive military alliance and more as part of a collective security system . <p> Support for enlarging NATO goes down when it is made clear to interviewees that NATO commits the US to defend its fellow members . Support for US military involvement goes up when questions are framed in terms of " joint action . " <p> The following polls show Americans ' views on NATO : <p> * The US should remain in NATO : 73 percent agreed , 15 disagreed , 12 percent did n't know . ( ABC , January 1994 ) . <p> * Should Russia be allowed to join NATO ? : 54 percent yes , 37 percent no . ( CNN/USA Today , January 1994 ) . <p> 8 Number of US troops in Europe : 48 percent thought the number is about right , 39 percent too many ; 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> What 's next ? <p> The hottest long-term issue facing NATO is enlarging the alliance . Advocates say that enlargement will help anchor formerly communist East bloc nations to the democratic West and allay their fears about Russia . <p> Questions about the consequences of a bigger NATO persist . Would Hungary and Poland 's membership , for example , anger and destabilize Russia ; redivide Europe with a new Iron Curtain farther east than before ; or wrap Central Europe so securely under the West 's protection that Russia would n't cause trouble ? <p> Countries seeking NATO membership must meet the prerequisites . For example , all NATO forces must be under clear civilian control . But regardless of their readiness to join , little action on expanding NATO is expected until after presidential elections in Russia and the US next year . New members will probably not join before the end of the century .
