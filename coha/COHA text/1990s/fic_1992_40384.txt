I know nothing about horses . They are dramatic , nervous , often beautiful . And they leave me cold . How could something so big and powerful allow itself to be tamed so completely ? <p> I was walking the dog in the park . It was a gorgeous , first touch of spring afternoon full of sharp and lush smells . I love forgetting the aromas of a season and then knowing them again for the first time . The dog was going nuts She was off the line , racing around not knowing where to go first , wanting everything . She 's a young thing , silly and loving . The two of us were enjoying each other 's company . <p> There are two parallel paths in that park  --  one for pedestrians , the other for horseback riders . The puppy did n't know what to make of these moving mountains when they clopped up slowly and went by . But instead of racing after them she froze , her only sign of life that long white tail whipping back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd walked for half an hour without seeing one . It seemed she had forgotten their presence in her universe until the sound of galloping came from behind us and the poor thing leapt straight up in the air . Landing , she scrunched down close to the ground , as if under attack . That made me laugh out loud and turn to see if the horseman had caught her performance . The galloping slowed and the horse chuffed indignantly  --  why are we stopping ? Why are you reining me in ? Shiny brown , muscles rolling and braking . Its head was pulled to one side , eyes and teeth flashing white . It took me a moment to recognize the man on board , but when I did , what a shock ! Gordon Epstein . One of the great , preeminent liars I have ever known . <p> " Harry Radcliffe ! What are you doing in Europe ? " <p> " Hi , Gordon . I 'm working on a project near Salzburg . And you ? " <p> Before he answers , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years ago . Some people change as they grow older , while others only become more of who they were at fifteen . Caterpillars versus snakes . Epstein was a snake . His one great talent was an ability to lie successfully . He was a natural liar the way other kids are natural athletes or intellects . But remember , while few of us are really athletic or smart , we all lie . So to be a great liar one must be at the same time more perceptive , witty , sensitive ... than those around you . If for no other reason than the danger of being caught . Epstein walked into that school a fifteen-year-old tenth-grade nobody ( like the rest of us ) , cased it out a few months , then made his play . He seduced the movers and shakers with the right amount of praise , back-patting , back-stabbing , and politicking . Teachers liked him because he knew enough to do well but not superbly and thus challenge or throw them off in any way . He learned the lingo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enabled him to make the teams . A strong B student , varsity athlete , a hale enough fellow to make people happy to know him . Someone said the world is divided into two kinds of people : The first kind we say , " Oh boy ! " when they enter a room . The second we say , " Oh shit ! " By the end of our sophomore year , most of the school said , " Oh boy ! " when Gordon arrived . <p> Yet most of the success resulted from his intense dishonesty . Study Epstein hard enough and you could see the effort he was making ; the frequent looks of concern or fatigue or straight fear way back in his eyes , the smile while he spun his webs and told the tales while keeping track of past ones , which were like dangerous caged animals that without constant checking and feeding broke their restraints and charged . <p> He was n't found out until our senior year . By then , however , he was way beyond anyone 's grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a girl on his arm at the spring prom who had flown in from California for the weekend and did nothing but gaze at him with pride and lust . <p> How Epstein was discovered was a gradual thing . After three years at the same school some of the lies and double crosses were bound to get back to their source . Good people who once believed in him started saying , " Heyyy , what is this ? " and telling others their suspicions . Maybe half our class realized the truth by the time we graduated . Those who did n't defended him strongly enough to make the others keep their anger and grumbles mostly to themselves . <p> While these years were passing , I floated somewhere near the middle of the class . Gordon had little use for people in the middle so he paid me little mind . He paid me no mind . But I watched him because even then I appreciated a good scoundrel . Although I was probably one of the first to sense what he was doing , I rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more important to me than I to him . <p> Throughout high school I was only there , floating like a goldfish with an occasional flick of my tail . Yet once I entered college and discovered architecture , I quickly became the self-assured , obnoxious success I am . In later years , whenever I remembered , I asked about Epstein . Once in a while his name appeared in the alumni journal or over a drink with one classmate or another I happened to run into at an airport or train station . He went to college , graduated , disappeared into the rest of the world . From every indication , he had peaked in high school and simply gone on to live a forgettable life . At different times I heard he was in business , teaching , social work . <p> Social work ! I loved that one . Gordon Epstein was on this planet for himself and forget the rest . The idea of him trying to ease the life of a poor , pregnant woman or homeless bum was impossible to swallow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do change sometimes , but not this man . Forget it . <p> Three years ago I was in Musso &; Frank 's having lunch when I heard a loud laugh from a nearby booth . Looking up , I saw the laugh belonged to a none other than Gordon Epstein . Older , naturally , fatter in the face and thinner on top , but definitely G.E . <p> I knew he would n't recognize me , but that was half the fun of standing up immediately and going over , hand extended . " Gordon Epstein ! How 're you doing ! " <p> He was with a couple of so-so looking women and the first expression that crossed his face was resentment  --  he did n't want anyone horning in on whatever territory he 'd gained with these two . Next , his expression went into cunning bewilderment  --  he saw who was greeting him , did n't know who it was , did n't want to show that , did n't want to look foolish , did n't want to be too enthusiastic . As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see the Gordon Epstein Command Center hard at work . <p> " Hey , how 're you doing ? ! " <p> " Gordon , I 'm Harry Radcliffe . Class of ' 67 at Banks ? " <p> Although it was plain he still did n't know who I was , just mentioning the name of the place where he 'd been king for a time brought me a loving look . <p> " Harry , God , how are you ? Come on and sit down . " <p> We talked for a couple of minutes . The way he behaved reminded me of a jolly big dog licking my face . He sounded so grateful to have met up with someone who knew him back then . Listening to him , I realized how lucky I was not to have had a wonderful childhood . Those who do , or those who peak in their early years , have only that remembered joy or strength to tide them over the rest of their lives . Nothing could ever be as good as that time , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had had a wife , no children . I did n't want all the information he offered . Once I knew he 'd gone on to live a life of quiet desperation I was satisfied . When he asked what I had been up to , I carefully and with the most strategic false modesty possible told him about my own eventful , successful life . When I was finished I felt good . It was stupid to show off in this pointless way , but I did it because he was an annoying ghost from my past and this was the only way I could exorcise it . Also , I fully believe in getting your licks in when you can . <p> Only when I was well into flatulating about my achievements did something strike me deep about what he 'd been saying . This man , no matter how unimpressive he appeared , was one of the sneakiest wheeler-dealers I 'd ever known . Unless one undergoes religious conversion or some other finding of The Light , lying , particularly on as grand and Byzantine a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was he so openly admitting his failure to me ? Especially in front of two women he was clearly trying to impress ? Something was up . I could feel deep in my own sneaky heart that Epstein was using me like a pickpocket who 's stripped you of all your valuables before you even sense he 's bumped you . The son of a bitch . I was n't going to stick around . Feeling like a dumb cluck , I nevertheless looked at my watch and groaned I was late for an appointment . The last glimpse I had of him was of his surprised face as I hurried to get out of the restaurant with at least some of me still intact . <p> The puppy started barking at his horse . I clipped her back on the leash and held her quivering against my leg . Gordon climbed down and we shook hands . <p> " Harry , I 'm really glad to see you . How long has it been ? Christ , so much has happened ! " <p> He was deeply tanned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was also much thinner than when we 'd met in California . <p> " You look good , Gordon . Like you 've been working out . " <p> Behind us , the horse chuffed loudly and Epstein whirled fully around to look at it . " What ? I did n't say anything ! " He said to the animal . <p> " Talking to your horse , Gordon ? " I said , very ha-ha joking . <p> Turning back to me , his narrowed eyes were all solid dislike and unhappiness . <p> " To my ghosts , Radcliffe . To my fucking spent ghosts . Come on , let 's sit down and I 'll tell you a story . You got time for a story ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> He started talking the moment we sat down . He let go of the horse 's reins , but the animal never wandered far from our bench . When my dog realized the behemoth was n't interested in her , she lay down under my legs . <p> " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sort of a weird guy ? " <p> " That 's right . He never took baths , but got all A 's . The man definitely has brains . Well , around the time you and I last met , I 'd just been canned from my last job . I 'd been doing public relations for a big oil company in L.A. , and I 'll tell you , I saved their ass for them . Remember that oil tanker that caught fire in Long Beach ? The one that leaked 30,000 crude into the harbor ? It belonged to Future Oil , my bosses . I worked day and night for those assholes trying to come up with clever ways of convincing the world that a 30,000-gallon oil spill was n't so bad . <p> " I did great work for them , Harry , but they still fired me the minute the news slipped from page one to the back of the newspaper . They did n't want to be reminded of what they 'd done . You know , kill the messenger and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they killed me anyway . " <p> The horse whinnied , but Gordon ignored it . " Spode was my roommate first year at Banks and we got along pretty well , oddly enough . He was okay , just tunnel-visioned . As long as he washed now and then we were fine . Without him , I would n't have passed Algebra Two ! <p> " Both of us went to Penn and bumped into each other a few times over the years . Nothing special . Then I did n't see him anymore after we graduated . <p> " After I was fired I was in bad shape . My ex-wife took the house , there was n't a whole lot of money in the bank , and I did n't have the slightest idea of what to do next . <p> " There 's a yearly reunion of Banks alumni at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel . Nothing big , but you always bump into someone surprising and have a good time . I never saw you there , Harry . Did you know about it ? Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what the hell and went . Halfway into a very comfortable drunk , who should put his arm on my shoulder but Fred Spode . Not that I would have recognized him because he looked wonderful  --  custom-made suit , manicured nails , cologne ! In the old days this guy 's clothes had no discernible color because they never got washed . Now I see Spode looking like an Italian crooner ! <p> " Turns out he 's hit it big with a mineral prospecting business , but hit it so big that he 's doing hanky-panky deals with governments the U.S. has n't spoken to for years . You know , like Libya and South Yemen ? But somehow Fred 's gotten the government 's tacit permission to work in these places and he 's raking it in . I wanted to kill the bastard . Instead I told him a little of my story . A couple of days later he calls up and offers me a job , just like that . I could have died . " <p> " What kind of job ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people do n't know it , but there are things going on in those places that are very surprising . People working behind the scenes to change the attitudes of their governments so they can start dealing and working with the West again . Not everyone is waving scimitars and screaming , " Death to the infidels . " Spode was right in the middle of this . The more these people moderated their stances toward the West , the more business he 'd be getting . What he wanted from me was to go there and have a good look around , then come back and start work on campaigns , very hush-hush , that would make the world think differently about these countries . You know , do promotional films and brochures about the people and their native customs , the beauty of their folklore .... Naturally the things would come out under the name of the specific governments , but all of the work would be done by us . " <p> " So where 'd you go ? How 'd you get in , sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you 're needed in these places , you can walk in with a marching band . Do you know how many Americans are working in the Libyan oil fields ? Enough to populate a nice-sized midwestern town . Only if you looked in their passports you would n't see any Libyan visas because those things get them in trouble . <p> " No , Harry , going in and out of them is no problem . What you see there is the problem . Or what happens to you after you 've seen it . <p> " For the first months it was great . You worked hard and even though the way they do things over there is enough to send you screaming with frustration , we got a lot done and Fred made life comfortable . Terrific pay , great connections and accommodations . You felt like you were making headway , you woke up every morning to the sound of a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer , and I guess that 's what I liked best : You woke up in the morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm in Aleppo ! ' or Mokka , Baghdad . A few months before , I was tossing hamburgers in L.A. , and now I was listening to the Arabian Nights out my window ! Beautiful . It was a beautiful time for me . I felt like I 'd been reborn . <p> " What do you think of me , Harry ? " <p> The question made me physically recoil . My head jerked like I 'd been pinched . It had come out of nowhere , and even more disconcerting was the fact that only a moment before , I 'd been thinking , Why has this guy been so fortunate ? I would have bet a thousand dollars he 'd not changed much from when we were in school . Just hearing he 'd tried to convince a polluted world that another oil spill was an okay thing was enough to convince me he 'd lied his way merrily , merrily , merrily until the bottom fell out and he got into trouble . Even then , who should pop up to save him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <p> " What do I think of you , Gordon ? I think you 're a dreadful and lucky man . " <p> " Not any more . The lucky part , I mean . I am still dreadful , but even that 's changing . Not that its my doing . " <p> " How do you mean ? " <p> " Now , that 's part two of my story . As you can tell , I was  --  you know , Harry , I 'm glad you said that just now . It makes me like you more . Are you always so honest ? " <p> " Only with people I do n't like . " <p> He laughed and clapped his hands . " You 'll feel better when I 'm finished . So , where was I ? In Paris . One day I was in Paris and got a call from Spode . He wanted me to fly to Teheran and go up north toward the Russian border , where some of our people were . By that time the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd already been in some pretty hot places and gotten along fine . So I caught the next flight there , was picked up at the airport and driven over . <p> " It 's nice country , very fertile and green , which is surprising when you think of a country like Iran . I 'd been there two days when the earthquake struck . " <p> " My God , Gordon , you were in that one that killed all those people ? Like 50,000 ? " <p> " Yes , I was . Thank God we were staying in an old house that withstood the whole thing . It happened in the middle of the night and  --  " <p> Until then he 'd been speaking in a calm voice , almost like that of a documentary film narrator . Suddenly he stopped . I looked over at him and there were tears sliding down his face . <p> " Are you okay ? " <p> Half of his face smiled , the other half was all pain . " Okay ? Sure I 'm okay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you ever been in a bad earthquake ? " <p> " That one in L.A. last year . " <p> He nodded . " Then you know . I never heard a sound like it . Like troops in a war . And the cracking and groaning , the millions of tons of rock grinding up against itself .... Have you ever heard the word zalzalah ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Neither did I until the next day . It means earthquake in both Arabic and Persian . According to the Koran , the world will end with an earthquake . A zalzalah . At that time , the Earth will give up all of its secrets . All the good and all the evil will be revealed . <p> " But you know something ? People think the end of the world will come with one big bang . A big CRASH and it 'll be all over . They 're wrong . It 's already begun and they do n't know it . But I do because I was there . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , Gordon , it was bad , but I did n't see Christ rise out of the San Andreas fault . " <p> " You do n't know what you saw because maybe it has n't touched you yet , but it will . Believe me , it will . I 'll tell you what happened to me , just as a small example . <p> " Both you and I know what kind of person I am . I do n't need to go into it , do I ? " <p> I shook my head . As far as what kind of person Gordon Epstein was , yes , we sure did know what he was talking about . <p> " Okay , so I can cut to the chase . Knowing the kind of person I was , imagine that man , that Epstein , next day walking around in this wrecked world as scared and exhilarated as I have ever been . I was alive ! I 'd survived an earthquake that killed 50,000 people ! Can you imagine ? I was never so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd come through . There were bodies and rubble and screaming and crying , but I was walking on my healthy two legs , safe ! Even when the aftershocks came  --  and there were many of them , believe me  --  I knew I was safe , that nothing would happen to me . You just know you 're through it . You made it . Nothing did happen to me until I lied . <p> " They came and asked me to help look for survivors . I was still scared , so I lied and said I was too sick to do it . There were two men , Radcliffe . Two men about our age . They 'd lost everything but were waiting to grieve till after they 'd helped as much as they could . They looked at me with nothing in their faces until one of them asked me if I knew about zalzalah . I said no and he told me what I just told you . Nothing else . <p> " A few moments later , my tongue turned to stone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant I knew what it meant : From then on , for the rest of my life , my tongue would turn to stone any time I lied . Like Pinocchio with his nose , only mine happened for maybe ten or fifteen seconds . Then it turned back to normal , and when I hid it carefully , no one knew what was happening . Only me , only Pinocchio Epstein with a stone for a tongue in his lying mouth . Zalzalah . The Earth will give up its secrets . All good will be revealed . And all evil . Guess who was evil and guess who got caught ? " <p> Before I had a chance to swallow that one , he continued . <p> " But I did n't need my evil to be revealed because I 'd known it all my life . The Earth was telling me I lied ? So what ? <p> " But the tongue was only the beginning . When I was able to get out of Iran , almost the moment I crossed the border , the tongue stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky grew instantly cloudy and no matter what kind of day it had been , a giant rain cloud came over me , only me , and began to pour down rain . It could be a brilliant sunny day and there I 'd be , alone with my terrible little thunderhead over my head , soaking only me for minutes on end . " <p> " Gordon- " <p> " It made me wonder if God read Lil Abner . Remember the character in the comic strip that happens to ? And after that stopped , it was the food . I would tell a lie and suddenly I was holding food in my hands  --  cooked turkeys or green beans , melting ice cream or baked potatoes . " <p> I started to get up but Gordon caught my arm . I pulled but he held fast . " Since I 've come here , it 's this horse ! One day it was there , outside the hotel door waiting for me . Do you know what it is ? All my lies together as one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too beautiful ? Look at the eyes , look at how smart they are . Look at the way it 's staring at us . When I 'm honest now , it goes away for a while , but I do n't know how to be honest . It 's not just a question of lie or do n't lie . Dishonesty gets under your skin like bacteria and then it becomes a virus . It makes its own and they 're all different . I never had to be honest , so I honestly do n't know how . Sooner or later there is always something new  --  a cloud , a tongue , a horse . It 's so goddamned insidious , too , because sometimes the things that happen are funny , you know ? Like suddenly you 're holding a corned beef sandwich in the middle of Carmen at the opera ? But then a day later you go blind every time you lie . Remember the story of Job ? How God tested him with one terrible thing after another ? It works the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad men too . But when you never know what it 's going to be  --  or good or bad or funny or so fucking frightening .... Do you know how hard it is not to lie ? Even with this "  --  he threw an arm out toward the horse  --  " near you every minute ? " <p> I could n't resist " How do I know you 're not lying now , Gordon ? " <p> He smiled proudly . " Look at the horse . " <p> I smiled back and did . In the animal 's mouth was an enormous and very beautiful bouquet of rare flowers , the kind you see at expensive florist shops . I had no idea where it came from . No idea of where it could have come from out there in the middle of that park of pine and chestnut trees , the spring not yet old enough for any real flowers to have come up yet , much less bloomed . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
