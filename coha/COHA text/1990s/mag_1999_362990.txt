 --  Aug. 30 : A five-year-old Santa Ana , Calif. , girl is found unconscious with bruises on her body . After she dies , her 28-year-old stepfather is charged with child abuse resulting in death . <P>  --  Oct. 2 : A 35-year-old man in Dayton is arrested for beating his stepson with a hammer , causing multiple skull fractures and a broken leg . <P>  --  Oct. 13 : A 26-year-old man in Chicago is charged with beating his three-year-old stepson to death . The medical examiner 's report details severe injury and abuse occurring over a period of time . <P> Tragic stories like these fill the nation 's newspapers . But do they have any relevance to stepfamilies as a whole ? Yes , say Martin Daly and Margo Wilson , two Canadian psychology professors at McMaster University in Ontario . In their slender new book , The Truth About Cinderella : A Darwinian View of Parental Love ( Yale University Press ) , the duo argue that having a stepparent is the most powerful risk factor for severe child abuse . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic parent and one stepparent is 100 times as likely to suffer fatal abuse as a child living with two genetic parents . In Daly and Wilson 's studies , a stepparent can also be an opposite-sex partner who lives with the parent , like a boyfriend . <P> Their reasoning , based on research in the U.S. , Canada , Britain and Australia , wo n't sit well with many stepparents . " Because parental love carries with it an onerous commitment , it would be strange if merely pairing up with someone who already had a dependent child were sufficient to fully engage the evolved psychology of parental feeling , " they write . " And it is not sufficient . Stepparents do not , on average , feel the same child-specific love and commitment as genetic parents , and therefore do not reap the same emotional rewards from unreciprocated ' parental ' investment . " Violence , they say , is just one , albeit dramatic , consequence . <P> In their view , it is no accident that fairy tales with wicked stepparents , like " Cinderella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French even have a proverb for this : " Quand la femme se remarie ayant enfants , elle leur fait un ennemi pour parent " ( The mother of babes who elects to re-wed/Has taken their enemy into her bed ) . <P> Similarly , there are animals that turn on their predecessor 's offspring , the authors say . " How do male tigers respond to the cubs sired by their predecessors ? The grisly answer is that they systematically search them out and kill them . " The Darwinian reason , say Daly and Wilson , is that all animals , including humans , prefer to promote their own " genetic posterity . " Unrelated youngsters do n't necessarily fit into that scheme . <P> Daly knows that their work , first published last year in England , is hard for some people , particularly nonacademics , to handle . " One thing that has fascinated and puzzled us is the fact that people do n't seem to like this finding . I 'm not sure what that 's about , " he says . " Stepfamilies are conflictual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a widespread feeling that somehow to make too big a deal of it or to talk about that too much is exacerbating their problems instead of helping them . " Still , he holds his ground . " Single parents might do well to be aware that there are a lot of risks in step relationships , and they should assess new partners in part with that in mind .
