From a speech given in July by President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia , at the opening of the Salzburg Festival in Austria . Havel was introduced by Austrian president Kurt Waldheim . Translated from the Czech by Kile'a Pold6kovci Henley . This June our country held its first free elections in many long decades . On July 5 a freely elected parliament reelected me president of Czechoslovakia . These events marked the culmination of one of the most dramatic periods of our modern history : the shattering of the totalitarian system . It was a time of excitement , swift decisions , and countless improvisations ; an utterly thrilling , even adventurous time . It was a little like a mildly bewildering but essentially wonderful dream . It was , in a way , a fairy tale . There were so many things that could have gone wrong ! We were traveling on totally unknown terrain , and none of us had any reason to believe that it would n't collapse under our feet . It did n't , though . And now the time has come when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its perils , is behind us , and the prospect of building a democratic state , in peace , is before us . Could there be a happier moment in the life of a land that has suffered so long under totalitarianism ? And yet precisely as that splendid historical moment dawned , a peculiar thing happened to me : When I arrived at work on the day after the election , I found 1 was depressed . I was in some sort of profoundly subdued state . I felt strangely paralyzed , empty inside . I suddenly seemed to have lost all my ideas and goals , my skills , hope , and resolve . I felt deflated , spent , lacking in imagination . Even though just a few days earlier I had been terribly busy , I suddenly had no idea what I was supposed to be doing . The pressure of exhilarating events , which until then had aroused in me a surprising level of energy , abruptly vanished , and I found myself standing bewildered , lacking the inner motivation for anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely odd sensation , comparable to a bad hangover after some wild binge , to awakening from a pleasant dream to the ugly reality of cold daylight , to the shock of a man in love discovering his sweetheart 's treachery . I was n't the only one with these strange feelings ; many of my colleagues at Prague Castle felt the very same way . We realized that the poetry was over and the prose was beginning ; that the county fair had ended and everyday reality was back . It was only then that we realized how challenging and in many ways unrewarding was the work that lay ahead of us , how heavy a burden we had shouldered . It was as if up to that moment the wild torrent of events had not allowed us to step back and consider whether we were up to the tasks we had undertaken . We had simply been tossed into the current and forced to swim , It seemed to us that only now could we begin to appreciate fully the weight of the destiny we had chosen . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances entirely groundless , sense of hopelessness . Somewhere in the depths of this feeling lay fear : fear that we had taken on too much , fear that we would n't be up to the job , fear of our own inadequacy ; in short , fear of our very selves . At the very deepest core of this feeling there was , ultimately , a sensation of the absurd : what Sisyphus might have felt if one fine day his boulder stopped , rested on the hilltop , and failed to roll back down . It was the sensation of a Sisy18 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/OCTOBER 199C From the Miami Herald . A. A. bout a year ago , when I was asked to launch this august festival with a brief lecture , I never considered that I might be able to attend in person . Still , I was pleased to accept the offer and planned to submit my contribution in writing . During the tranquil Christmas season I would calmly compose a little essay on the theme of fear and the sense of danger in Central European literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both time and concentration . So I decided to complete the task after the elections ; in fact , I was truly looking forward to it , since it would allow me to enjoy a brief return to my original profession as a writer and because I planned to use the occasion as a dividing mark between the first , revolutionary , stage of my political commitment and the second stage , a calmer one , which involved building up rather than tearing down . I did , in fact , find the time to write . But the time I found was the period of my peculiar hangover . First history got in my way ; now I was getting in my own way : I was simply unable to write anything ; I was depleted , paralyzed , powerless . What a paradox : I had wanted to write about fear , and here it was fear that was incapacitating me in my writing . Fear of my subject matter , fear of the act of writing itself , fear of my ownspecific to Central European culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increased perception of danger , a heightened sensitivity to the phenomenon of fear . It makes perfect sense : In a place where history has always been so intricately tangled ; in a place with such complex cultural , ethnic , social , and political structures ; in a place that saw the origins of the most varied of European catastrophes , fear and danger are the very dimensions of human experience that must be felt and analyzed most intensely . I believe that even the kind of fear that I experienced is typical of the Central European spiritual world , or at least is understandable against its background . Certainly it would be hard to imagine that in England , France , or the United States a person could be depressed by his political victory . In Central Europe , on the other hand , it seems perfectly natural . READINGS 19 For that matter , the experience of the hangover-type void is certainly not unique to me , nor is that odd sense of fear . I have observed variations of that fear and emptiness quite often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Central and Eastern Europe that have shaken off totalitarianism . It was with a great deal of effort that people in these lands attained the freedom they yearned for . The moment they gained that freedom , however , it was as if they had been ambushed by it . Unaccustomed to freedom , they now , suddenly , do n't know what to do with it ; they are afraid of it ; they do n't know what to fill it with . Their Sisyphean struggle for freedom has left a vacuum ; life seems to have lost its purpose . Similarly , in this part of the world we observe symptoms of a new fear of the future . Unlike totalitarian times , when the future , though wretched , was certain , today it is very unclear . The single ( if ubiquitous ) familiar danger represented by totalitarian oppression seems to have been replaced by an entire spectrum of new and unfamiliar ? or long-forgotten dan-gers : from the danger of national conflicts to the danger of losing social-welfare protections to the danger of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very good at being persecuted and at losing . That may be why we are so flustered by our victories and so disconcerted that no one is persecuting us . Now and then I even encounter indications of nostalgia for the time when life flowed between banks that , true , were very narrow but that were unchanging and apparent to everyone . Today we do n't know where the banks lie , and it makes us a little uncomfortable . I repeat that the existential situation 1 illustrated for you on my own person , and which I have also observed in various forms in my fellow citizens , is , in my opinion , a particularly Central European one . Our literature contains innumerable examples of it in our not too distant past , in the atmosphere following both World War 1 and World War II . In short , it seems that fate has ordained that we , more frequently than others , and often in unexpected situations , shall be afraid . For us , fear of history is not just fear of the future but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these two fears are conditional one on the other : A person who is afraid of what is yet to come is generally also reluctant to look in the face of what has been . And a person afraid to look at his own past must fear what is to come . All too often in this part of the world , fear of one lie gives birth to another lie , in the foolish hope that by protecting ourselves from the first lie we will be protected from lies in general . But a lie can never protect us from a lie . Those who falsify history do not protect the freedom of a nation but rather constitute a threat to it . The idea that a person can rewrite his autobiography is one of the traditional self-deceptions of Central Europe . Trying to do that means hurting oneself and one 's fellow countrymen . When a truth is not given complete freedom , freedom is not complete . One way or another , many of us are guilty . But we can not be forgiven , nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our guilt . I have many reasons for believing that the truth purges one from fear . Many of us who , in recent years , strove to speak the truth in spite of everything were able to maintain an inner per-spective , a willingness to endure , a sense of pro-portion , an ability to understand and forgive our neighbors , and a light heart only because we were speaking the truth . Otherwise , we might have perished from despair . Our specific Central European fear has led fear of truth . Let us finally take a direct , calm , and unwavering look into our own countenances : our past , our present , and our future . Let us try to delve into the core of our doubts , our fears , and our despair to come up with the seeds of a new European self-confidence ? the self-confidence of those who are not afraid of looking beyond the horizon of their personal and community interests , beyond the horizon of this moment .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
