<p> TX <p> WITHIN Cosa Nostra , they spoke of a certain Christian Democratic politician as close to the organization . <p> So close , in fact , said former top Mafioso Leonardo Messina , that they called him , almost affectionately , " uncle . " <p> The politician , he told investigating magistrates on Jan. 9 , was Giulio Andreotti , the internationally respected statesman , the seven-time prime minister of Italy . <p> Mr. Andreotti was notified March 27 by judges in Palermo that he was under investigation for links to the Mafia . Andreotti , in a statement the same day , called the declarations of the ex-Mafiosi " absurd , " recalling the " very tough and effective laws " he had proposed against the Mafia . <p> In asking Parliament to waive Andreotti 's immunity from prosecution as a senator , the judges say he acted " in a systematic way ... to protect the interests and achieve the ends of the organization . " There is no proof , they say , that the former prime minister was actually a Mafioso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Mafioso prisoner had once told him Andreotti had been formally initiated . Messina is the only pentito , as ex-Mafia collaborators with justice are known , to have made this assertion . <p> Parliament is to decide April 14 on lifting Andreotti 's immunity . <p> The request comes as Italians have grown increasingly intolerant of Cosa Nostra . As a result , politicians , law enforcement officials , and investigating magistrates are intensifying the fight against organized crime . <p> " The climate has changed in Italy , " says Leoluca Orlando , the head of the Rete , a clean government , anti-Mafia party . " Some of the politicians that were before untouchable have lost power . " <p> In January , Salvatore ( " Toto " ) Riina , the reputed " boss of bosses " in the Sicilian Mafia , was arrested . In addition to the Andreotti probe , two judges and five parliamentarians in Naples were notified last week that they are under investigation for ties to the Camorra criminal organization . And on March 31 , the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission presented its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was excerpted in two pages of La Repubblica . <p> The Christian Democratic Party ( DC ) immediately denounced the commission 's report for placing too much faith in the statements of pentiti . And on April 2 , in a move criticized inside and outside the party , the DC presented a formal statement to the Italian public prosecutor saying a " political conspiracy " was manipulating pentiti testimony to discredit Andreotti and others . <p> Recent polls show Italians are much more reluctant to stay silent about the Mob 's activities . A key reason is revulsion at the brutal murders allegedly carried out by Mr. Riina 's agents , including those last year of anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino . Falcone had led investigating magistrates during the 1980s " maxi-trials , " which sentenced 338 Mafiosi . <p> " The deaths of these two men was the point of no return in Italian democracy , " says Gian Maria Fara , head of the Ispes political institute here . <p> " The attacks in reality served to weaken the organization , both inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980s maxi-trials . " Many investigators have said that this has made people think again about the Mafia . " <p> The announcement that Andreotti was under investigation stunned the world , but some of those who have fought the Mafia for years had a different reaction . <p> Falcone , who is revered here for his painstaking anti-Mafia investigations , would not have been surprised , said former Judge Giuseppe Ayala , who worked closely with him . Antonino Caponnetto , the former head of the anti-Mafia pool of judges , told Epoca magazine he was not all that surprised to hear that Andreotti was under investigation and added , speaking of the Andreotti government 's strug-gle against the Mafia , " Perhaps I was paying attention to other things , but I was n't aware of it . " <p> The Palermo judges write to Parliament that in April 1982 Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa , a respected anti-Mafia Carabiniere general , " had identified the Andreotti current in Sicily as the ' most polluted political family of the place ' ... the expression within the DC of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his future activity . " Dalla Chiesa was murdered by Cosa Nostra in Palermo , Sept. 3 , 1982 . <p> Central to the current probe is European Parliament Deputy Salvo Lima , who was gunned down in Palermo March 12 , 1992 . The former Palermo mayor was well known for two things : He was Andreotti 's No. 1 man in Sicily and the Sicilian politician closest to the Mob . Since the murder , Andreotti has repeatedly said it has not been proven that Lima was linked to the Mafia . <p> " Salvo Lima was long the point of contact for various Mafia families , " said the anti-Mafia commission 's report , which then cited testimony given to the Palermo magistrates on Sept. 11 , 1992 , by super-pentito Tomasso Buscetta . " To my knowledge , " Mr. Buscetta declared , " Salvo Lima was the politician to whom Cosa Nostra mainly turned for matters of interest to the organization that required a solution in Rome . " <p> " Senator Andreotti is precisely the person to whom Salvo Lima constantly turned for decisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gaspare Mutolo , an ex-Mob hit man and driver for Riina , told the Palermo judges March 4 . <p> Buscetta , in subsequent testimony to the anti-Mafia commission , said he would only name the Mob 's " Roman point of contact " to the judges . The commission notes , however , that " the declarations of Buscetta and Mutolo are substantially the same . " The Palermo judges add that " Giulio Andreotti combines in himself almost all the qualities " that Buscetta described . <p> The anti-Mafia commission describes Bus-cetta , a high-ranking Mafia penitent , as the pentito best acquainted with Cosa Nostra 's mentality . <p> Lima 's demise was ordered after a Mafia defeat in the courts , pentiti say . The April 6 Epoca magazine says pentito Baldassarre Di Maggio , the former driver and bodyguard of Riina whose revelations led to the latter 's arrest , told judges early this year that in October or November 1991 he drove Lima , at Riina 's request , from the Rome airport to then-Prime Minister Andreotti 's private office in central Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals court , was preparing to decide on the legality of 19 life sentences of Mafiosi handed down in 1987 . Mr. Di Maggio said that Cosa Nostra wanted a decision favorable to the organization and that Lima had promised to bring the matter up with Andreotti . <p> The Mafia had faith in the Court of Cassation , Mr. Mutolo told the Palermo judges , because it thought it had a special political channel to reach Judge Corrado Carnevale of the court . That channel , the judges say , was Giulio Andreotti . <p> " It was said within the Mafia , in fact , that Senator Andreotti had a special personal relationship with Carnevale , " the judges write . <p> Carnevale denies knowing either Andreotti or Lima and says any annulling of sentences was done collegially . Carnevale was advised on March 29 that he was under investigation for ties to the Mafia . In January 1992 , the Court of Cassation upheld the maxi-trial sentences . Two months later Lima was murdered . <p> " Mutolo emphasized that Lima had been killed because he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Cosa Nostra , had then betrayed its commitments on the maxi-trials , " the Palermo judges write . " What Mutolo heard within the Mafia , in fact , was that it was necessary to send ' a message to his master . ' " <p> Andreotti maintains Lima could have been murdered in retaliation for the Andreotti government 's anti-Mafia stance .
