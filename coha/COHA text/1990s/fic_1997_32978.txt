Monsieur Alle Howie watched nervously as Glenda arranged his Crab and Ginger Egg Rolls on the stoneware platter . For color , she added a garnish of crisp , carved radish roses . Howie had shaved . He 'd washed his hair -- piles of wet curly silver hair fell over his forehead and ears . He 'd put on a clean blue oxford cloth shirt . His shoulders were rounded from years of sitting hunched over at his desk writing wildlife documentaries . Howie was finally forty-five -- his oversensitive morose expression had had the effect of making him look forty-five since nursery school . " Is there anything funny about this yet ? " Howie asked . " Not funny ha-ha , " Glenda said . They sat down in the huge leather Guatemalan club chairs and put their feet up on the matching ottomans . For the third time in as many weeks , they awaited Monsieur Alle , the child abuse investigator from the New York City Department of Special Services for Children . Glenda 's black cotton Chinese slippers peeked out from under the billowing yardage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue so enchanting , they managed to whisper of South Seas sunsets and turquoise oceans even here at Seventy-fourth and Broadway on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . At thirty-nine , Glenda 's face was a collision of two centuries . Her girlhood beauty had embodied the nineteenth-century feminine ideals of hope , charity and mercy as portrayed in naive American statuary , but life had blasted her hot and hard and now the nerves of her face seemed too raw to feel hope , the smile too wary for charity , the huge green eyes too fearful of the absence of mercy everywhere to dispense their share . Her long , brown hair was thinning . Glenda wondered why Monsieur Alle had originally seemed in such a big hurry to investigate Howie . He had wanted to come to the apartment within forty-eight hours of receiving the report of abuse from the Pierrepont School . Glenda was ruffled by his phone call -- what to serve ? Her signature appetizer , Warmed , Marinated Goat Cheese on Whole Wheat Cumin Pita Toasts , was passe . So she persuaded Howie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed her mind that Monsieur Alle might take the appetizer as a bribe , an attempt to bolster a poor moral reputation with a rich culinary one , but she decided to proceed . Amazing appetizers were a family custom . To offer the Monsieur nothing , she reasoned , might add nuances of pretense and deceit to the investigation , casting an unwarranted shadow of suspicion . Two dozen crispy , golden , delicate crab rolls were draining on paper towels that first night when Monsieur Alle had called from the bowels of Brooklyn , apologizing at length in his vaguely noble accent , saying that he could not keep the appointment because he was still in the process of investigating a family there . Glenda rescheduled . Howie wrapped and carefully froze the rolls . They were sitting in the club chairs the next week with the crab rolls reheated and arranged on the platter , waiting for Monsieur Alle and listening to Classic Rock radio when the disc jockey broke the **28;279;TOOLONG rule by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Free Bird " twice in a row . Howie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on the area rug together in ecstasy , until a brutal shout from Roddy , Glenda 's sixteen-year-old son , broke the mood . " Phone ! " he yelled , opening the door to his bedroom just wide enough to stick out his shaved head . Howie 's nine-year-old daughter , Mimi , was on the phone , calling from a booth at the corner of Ninety-sixth and Broadway . She was locked out of her mother 's apartment -- her mother was out of town on business and would n't be back until late . Howie took a cab up , let Mimi in with his key , then because Mimi was afraid to be alone , Howie called all three of the Allegras in Mimi 's fourth grade class to try to arrange a spur-of-the-moment play date . No go . Howie brought Mimi home . The child abuse charge was a secret from her -- how would he occupy her during Monsieur Alle 's investigation ? When Monsieur Alle called to say in that lilting , vaguely aristocratic accent of his that he would be an hour late , Glenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alle respected this . The investigation was rescheduled for the following week . Glenda wondered now if the initial jostling of the appointment time was contrived by Monsieur Alle to add to his information about the family . Perhaps the evaluation was already under way . As she looked about the room , wondering what he 'd think of it , she felt sorry for her furnishings . The things she 'd acquired over twenty years and three loves looked crowded and eccentric in this staid floor plan . Squeezed unsacredly onto the limited wall space were a pair of Tibetan Tangkas -- complex , richly colored scrolls , symmetrically designed for Buddhist meditation , though her first love , Sol , the father of Roddy , had used them more often as implements of seduction . The Guatemalan club chairs had somehow been toted north from Central America on a Volkswagen bug by Jean , father of Glenda 's fourteen-year-old son , Neil . With Howie came the Mexican motif . Rustic wood chairs with high , straight backs and rush seats encircled a heavy , somber table . The set spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowing a folding chair . Glenda felt guilty , forcing things from three different men to mix within such conventional walls . Yet , considering all they 'd been through , she was grateful her things had survived at all . The bell rang at 7:15 . Neil sprang to answer it . Tall and thin , wearing his customary black T-shirt and black jeans , Neil offered to take Monsieur Alle 's tan detective coat . Some gold or brass totem of personal significance hung from a chain around Neil 's neck . His dark-blond hair he wore in a ponytail that reached to the middle of his back . His face presented the same classic , even features as his mother 's , but projected an elusive caginess and despair . The mystery of the vaguely noble accent was revealed : Monsieur Alle was Haitian . His manner was gentle and dignified , his suit well made but not ostentatious , his eyeglasses round with gold wire frames . Glenda urged Monsieur Alle to be seated on the sofa as near as possible to the appetizers . Roddy broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theatrical English accent , " There was a bit of a nastiness last night , yes ? Some very extreme nastiness , yes ? A few of a certain Billy Boy 's friends were ambulanced off , yes ? " Howie and Neil laughed heartily . Roddy had committed the entire dialogue of A Clockwork Orange to memory . Glenda studied the Monsieur 's reaction to Roddy . He did not seem to be alarmed by Roddy 's appearance . Good -- she would not have to explain to him that although Roddy 's head was shaved like a skinhead 's , although he wore the same brand of heavy black lace-up boots skinheads wore and went to clubs where skinheads and longhairs broke each other 's jaws , he went as a cultural observer , and was not , per se , a skinhead . Real skinheads were white supremacists . How could Roddy be a white supremacist when his father , Sol , was a child of the Holocaust ? Roddy was serious , spiritually serious . The great blue dragon tattooed permanently on the full length of his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the dragon was a well-known symbol of spiritual evolution . It seemed obvious to Glenda that in a society which did not provide a sufficient ritual to mark a boy 's transition into manhood , a serious youth made up his own . She had tried and failed to make up a transition ritual for Roddy -- she 'd dispensed with Chore Points . Chore Points were allotted for voluntary chores , five points for Ajaxing the bathtub , three points for Windexing the kitchen cabinets , one point for Lemon-Pledging the coffee table . Chore Points could be amassed , then redeemed for Privileges : staying up late to watch TV , baking chocolate chip cookies with Mom even if Mom was tired , that kind of thing . Dispensing with Chore Points had failed to prepare Roddy for manhood . Glenda felt sorry -- he was a male adrift in a psychotic culture with the millennium approaching like a tsunami . Neil was also adrift , but unlike Roddy , he was not fascinated by people . He was misanthropic . He stayed in his room much of the time reading science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brilliant . Nearly every teacher in the Pierrepont School had said so . Glenda had years of written evaluations confirming it . Over and over , the teachers would write , Roddy or Neil shows no interest whatsoever in his homework , which is frustrating to me as both his test scores and his occasional in-class responses indicate he is brilliant . " These are Howie 's special crab rolls , " Glenda said to the Monsieur . We drink beer with them . Will you have one ? " Monsieur Alle did not drink alcohol , never had , he said , because in Haiti , he 'd been a minister and wanted to set a good example . Now , in America , where standards were more lax , it was too late for him to develop a taste for it . Tea was his drink , any kind of tea . Glenda brought him a pot of Lapsang Souchong . Monsieur Alle opened his briefcase . " You are married ? " he asked Howie , his pen poised over the first blank on the intimidating yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Less decisively he added , " To Mimi 's mother . " " He does n't want to hurt her feelings , " Glenda explained . " Plus , Glenda 's still married to Neil 's father , " Howie pointed out . " He does n't believe in paying lawyers to achieve our emotional resolution , " Glenda said . " So Howie is your boyfriend , " Monsieur Alle said to Glenda , neatly filling in the blank . He moved his pen down a line . " Roddy and Neil are whose sons ? " " Different people 's , " Glenda said . She explained about Sol and Jean . " They live here full time ? " Monsieur Alle asked . " We are all here full time , " Glenda said . " Howie and I make sure that one or both of us are here every day when the boys get out of school . " Monsieur Alle 's dark eyes darted from Roddy and Neil to Glenda and Howie . " Why ? " " We just want to be here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no one being there for them when they were little . If they want to ask for my help on homework or get Howie 's advice on girls , we 're here . " Monsieur Alle 's brow was furrowed in bafflement . " And do they ask for your help on homework ? " " No , " Glenda said . " They come home stoned and go straight to their rooms and listen to loud , robotic , post-punk nihilistic German bands . You should hear this awful music , Monsieur Alle . " " And do they ask your advice on girls , Howie ? " Monsieur Alle asked . " No . But I think it 's important that I 'm here . They 're growing up with a creative male in the home . " " Your daughter , " Monsieur Alle said . " She does n't need to grow up with a creative male in the home ? " " No , she needs a breadwinning female , who 's capable , flexible , bright , beautiful and never is home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders stiffened . He returned to the investigation report . " Neil , please summarize the incident that occurred three weeks ago . " " Howie . Was in the kitchen . Making spicy . Oven-fried chicken . " Neil respectfully spoke at the pace that Monsieur Alle was capable of writing script . Glenda watched the Monsieur 's pen as it formed lines of even , flowing lowercase letters . " Look , Howie , " she said . " If our kids had gone to public school in Haiti instead of going to private progressive school in Manhattan , they would be able to write traditional script instead of printing everything in that unpredictable mixture of capital and lowercase letters . " Monsieur Alle read the sentence back to Neil , making it a question . " Howie was in the kitchen making Spicy Oven-fried Chicken ? " " It was Howie 's night to cook , " she said , interrupting . " We have an equal opportunity kitchen . Howie made these . " She explained how the crab rolls were made and listed the twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of something , " Neil said with annoyance . " Continue , " Monsieur Alle said , eschewing the crab rolls . " I came in . To get . Some potato chips . Howie was taking pieces . Of raw chicken . Out of the package . And rolling them . In flour . " " That 's called dredging , " Glenda said to Neil . " Howie was dredging . I said to Howie . Did you wash . The chicken first . He beat me up . " Monsieur Alle 's eyes grew dark and thunderous . He was impressed . " Who witnessed this ? " he asked . Glenda raised her hand . Roddy half-raised his , saying , " I came in for the ball-kicking . " " Ball-kicking , " Monsieur Alle echoed . " My , my . " " We lived in a commune in Vermont , " Glenda blurted out . " There was no authority figure . Everyone raised everyone . We ate organically grown food . The apricots got mealy worms . There were bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't the future . It was the past , the past that progress had improved . I left Jean . " Everyone was staring at Glenda . " Howie , " Monsieur Alle said . " What is your side ? " " It 's true , " Howie said . " I was making Spicy Oven-fried Chicken . I coat the chicken with a special mixture of flour , salt and pepper , paprika , cayenne pepper , garlic powder and toasted sesame seeds . " " Sesame seeds , " Monsieur Alle said , his eyes shining with a special Caribbean brightness . " You toast them first , " Howie said . " Mimi was having dinner with us . Spicy Oven-fried Chicken is her favorite dish . I was also making mashed potatoes -- Neil will only eat potato products , mashed potatoes , french fries , potato knishes , potato chips . And I was making Green Beans in Olive Oil with garlic for Roddy . Because he 's avoiding meat for ninety days as a purge . He 'd been through a raw phase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals in raw foods . He ate a lot of raw oysters and steak tartar . Apparently for some people these are the keys to longevity . They made him sick . " Everyone relaxed while Monsieur Alle wrote down the menu and its rationale . The boys dipped the crab rolls in the sauce . Howie ate the radish roses . Glenda drank two Tsing-Tao beers . Monsieur Alle , she observed , would be well served by a tape recorder . " Continue , " Monsieur Alle said . " So Neil is walking back and forth in front of me , " Howie said . " Eating potato chips . Watching me . And making a face . " " What kind of face ? " Howie demonstrated , bloating his face slightly in the cheeks , mouth and jaw , as if he were two seconds away from vomiting . Neil looked proud of himself . " That face . Seven years I 've been cooking for him and what do I get . Always that face . He stands there eating the chips , watching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wash the chicken first . I stop what I 'm doing . It 's important to wash the chicken first , he says , to remove the grody slime . Look , dickhead , I say , the chicken is not for you . The potatoes are for you . And I point him to the pot on the range where the potatoes are boiling . If I have time , I make real mashed potatoes . If not , I buy Idahoan . Idahoan are the only instant dehydrated potatoes that taste like homemade . " When Monsieur Alle had caught up , Howie went on . " So , Neil goes to the pot , he lifts off the cover , he looks inside . He 's still making that face . Say one word and you 're dead , I say to him . Ugh , he says . I have this nice fat floury chicken thigh in my hand . And something comes over me , and I throw it at him . It hits him hard right in his face -- smack ! There 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh falls to the floor . He picks up the thigh and throws it back at me . It hits me here in the chest . Pow , I get him in the face . Pow , in the neck . As fast as I can throw them at him , that 's how fast he 's throwing them back . " Monsieur Alle had stopped writing and was listening with an arrested expression . Glenda crossed her legs daintily at the ankle . " You 've got a good home here , " Roddy quoted to Neil in his whining English accent , " good loving parents . You 've got not too bad of a brain . Is it some devil that comes inside of you ? " Neil was laughing soundlessly . " There was flour everywhere , " Howie said . " Flour all over me , all over Neil , all over the floor , the table , the chairs . Everywhere . Mimi happens to walk into the room to ask a question about her history chapter . " " She 's very bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mimi . We 're ducking , we 're kicking over chairs , chicken is flying . Mimi screams at me to help her with her history chapter . I say , For God 's sake , Mimi , not now . She runs out of the apartment and runs twenty blocks up Broadway to her home , only her mother 's out of town on business and Mimi 's forgotten her key , so she has to come back . " " You witnessed this , " Monsieur Alle said , turning a suspicious eye on Glenda . " We lived in a tepee on Mount Shasta one summer . " Glenda said . " We had a goat . We carried water from a spring . " " We 're down to a few raw chicken backs , " Howie said . " I get him hard in the cheek . It smarts -- I can see that . So I say , Let 's call it quits . Fuck you , he says , and fuck your mother where she breathes . Do n't ever say that about my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't go . I attempt to bodily remove him from the kitchen . He kicks me in the balls . " " A shock , " Roddy whined , " sending my dada beating his bruised and krowy lukkers and unfair Bog in his heaven and my mom boo-hooing in her mother 's grief about her only son letting everybody down real horrorshow . " " I grab him , " Howie said . " By the skin on his back . And push him out of the apartment and into the hall . When you 're prepared to apologize for what you said about my mother , you can come back , I said . " Did he apologize ? " Monsieur Alle asked . " She let him in , " Howie said , pointing to Glenda . " Howie told me to , " she said . " How long was he out there ? " Howie and Glenda looked at each other , trying to remember precisely . " It 's hard to judge the passage of time in a family crisis , " Glenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour seems like a minute . " " Ten minutes , " Roddy said crisply . " Howie locked the door at 7:50 and unlocked it so Neil could see The Cosby Show . " " Did he apologize ? " Monsieur Alle demanded . Neither Howie nor Glenda could remember . Monsieur Alle seemed disappointed . " Jean 's mother always washed the chicken , " Glenda said . Monsieur Alle consulted the official complaint form in his file . " There were bruises , " he said . " I saw the bruises when I went in to say goodnight to Neil , " Glenda said . " He had his shirt off and was looking at the bruises in the mirror . There were terrible marks on his back , on the shoulder blades and the upper spine where Howie grabbed him . I went to get ice packs , but Neil would n't let me back in his room . He did n't want me anywhere near him , did you , Neil ? " Glenda watched Neil shrink even now at the thought of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did the bruises on your back come to the attention of Ms. Lambert-Castor ? " Monsieur Alle asked Neil , reading from the complaint form . Neil drew a blank . " He means Cynthia , " Glenda said to Neil . To Monsieur Alle , she said , " Everyone at the Pierrepont School , even the head , is on a first-name basis . " " I told my friend that Howie beat me up , " Neil said . " He told Cynthia . " " Five years I helped her with the silent auction , " Howie said to Monsieur Alle . " I called parents . I picked up donations . I set up tables . " " She is legally bound as a school official to call it in , " Monsieur Alle stated . " Five years , " Howie said . " Watch her call me again this fall . " No more . Comprende , senor ? No mast . " " It 's an anti-parent school , " Glenda explained . " We purposely picked it because we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Roddy and Neil to individuate , even if it meant hating us a little earlier than they normally would . And you did , did n't you , boys ? " Monsieur Alle had not written anything down since the first piece of chicken was thrown . He was sipping his tea , and looking at Glenda with pity and contempt . " Roddy and Neil , " he said eventually , " Did Howie ever throw things at you before , did he ever strike you ? " The boys laughed . " My problem 's passivity , " Howie admitted . " It works for me , babe , " Glenda said . She and Howie clasped hands . " Oh God , here they go , " Neil said to Roddy . " Why do n't you two do the frug for Monsieur Alle , " Roddy said to Glenda and Howie . " A-one , a-two . " He snapped his fingers in time as Neil sang the opening guitar riff of Jimi Hendrix 's cover of " All Along the Watchtower . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " Glenda instructed the Monsieur . " So Howie has never treated the boys in a way that frightened them ? " Monsieur Alle said , sticking to the point . " Put it this way , " Glenda said . " The day I told him he 'd been reported by the Pierrepont School for child abuse was shopping day . He was very upset when he shopped . What 's this , I said , when I unpacked . He 'd bought Pepperidge Farm Milanos . Neil likes Mint Milanos . After what Neil did to me , Howie said , he 's not getting Mint Milanos . He 's getting regular . " Monsieur Alle was frowning deeply . He refilled his cup from the teapot . He sipped . He continued as if by rote . " Glenda , did you ever throw things at the boys or strike them ? " " I threw plates at Jean twice , " Glenda admitted . " I once grabbed Roddy hard by the upper arms . He had marks on his skin . When you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one is or was in the habit of striking you ? " Monsieur Alle asked the boys . Neil raised his chin provocatively as if to take one on it right then and there . Roddy drummed on his thigh with the flats of his hands , a fast , frenetic polyrhythm . Glenda was remembering the last big horrible fight the boys had had with Jean . " No , " Neil said finally , shaking his head with annoyance . " They have a good relationship with Jean , " Howie volunteered in a voice as bright and persuasive as a game show host 's . " They go to Vermont every summer . Well , they used to before --  . They 're city kids now . And Sol is --  . " " We do n't know where Sol is , " Roddy said curtly . A demoralized silence filled the room . An impression of the underlying brutality of family life seized Glenda . The furnishings in the room shimmered with years of rage and pain , deadly , dull , throbbing , unresolvable . Errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence as palpable as heat waves from Glenda 's things . " Goats are a lot of work , " she said shrilly . " You have to milk them twice a day . Goat 's milk is too strong to drink , but the cheese is wonderful . We had goat cheese twenty years before it showed up on every menu in Manhattan . " Religious generosity overtook Monsieur Alle 's professional disgust with Glenda and Howie . His eyes shone with grace . " You are nice people , " he said quietly . He folded the official complaint form and the yellow investigation report in half , then in quarters . He was legally required , he explained , to detain the children privately and invite them to add to their statements without the parents being present . Glenda and Howie withdrew to the kitchen . She called Avi 's , the healthy neighborhood pizzeria , and ordered an extra-large pie with mushrooms and green peppers on one half , spinach and garlic on the other and extra cheese over the whole . The garlic was for Roddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howie and the garlic for herself . Mixing up the halves like that and adding extra cheese drove up the price of the pie to thirty-seven dollars , but Glenda believed anything so simple that made everyone happy was worth the cost . She peeked into the living room a few times as the boys continued with Monsieur Alle . She could n't catch specific words or phrases , but based on their arm movements and gestures , they were taking turns describing the tepee , the fire where they cooked , the goat pen they built , the brook they walked to for water . Monsieur Alle looked homesick . He rose from the sofa , briefcase in hand . Neil went to the closet to retrieve the Monsieur 's detective coat . Glenda and Howie came forth from the kitchen to see him to the door . While they were waiting for the elevator , Monsieur Alle got to talking with Howie about Haiti . He felt guilty , leaving his congregation in Port-au-Prince without a minister , but he had to flee that regime to give his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Six children ! " Howie said to Glenda . " Think of the tuition bills if they all went to the Pierrepont School . " " What are their names ? " Glenda asked , expecting a litany of powerful , vowel-heavy Afro-Caribbean syllables , but Monsieur Alle and his wife had chosen All-American New Testament names . As he uttered them , the light in his eyes reflected the special nature of each . They were serious , sly , weak , strong , gentle and playful . He was strict with them -- he explained the details . There were curfews , minimum acceptable report cards , duties to complete at home . Serious spankings were the consequence of nonperformance . Howie was spellbound . The elevator came and went twice as Howie continued to ask Monsieur Alle to give examples of infractions , swearing , failing a test , forgetting to do the laundry . They talked so long the pizza came . It smelled delectable and spicy , so delectable and spicy , Glenda could n't blame the boys for opening the box right in front of Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politeness , to offer him some . " Wo n't you stay for a slice , Monsieur Alle ? " she said . He looked hungrily at the delicious sizzling pie . He really should be getting home , he said . " Please stay , " she said . His wife always kept his dinner warm , he said . His nose got a wrinkle in it when he said dinner , as if he 'd smelled chlorine . Glenda understood -- his wife , though fertile , was not a good cook . " It 's our custom that you stay , " she said , grabbing his briefcase out of his hand . They seated themselves at the huge somber table and ate the pie and while they ate , Howie asked Monsieur Alle to tell again about how he spanked his sons .
