Public interest in the Wyeths has brought attention to the family 's primary artistic influence  --  the fine-art approach to illustration championed Howard Pyle . <p> Although he is considered the father of American illustration , Howard Pyle ( 1853-1911 ) did n't receive widespread attention until recently , when two exhibitions linked him to the controversial but undeniable American cultural icon  --  the Wyeth family of artists . Last spring , the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford , Pennsylvania , showcased some 130 works by Pyle from the Brokaw Family Collection in a variety of media . The show not only demonstrated Pyle 's diverse skills as an artist , but also explored his influence as a teacher , most notably the teacher of N.C. Wyeth . Further establishing this tie to the Wyeths , the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland , Maine , inaugurated its new Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine this summer with " Wondrous Strange : Pyle , Wyeth , Wyeth , &; Wyeth . " The exhibition , organized jointly with the Delaware Art Museum , will be on view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship resulting from these exhibitions sheds new light on the special challenges posed by the art of illustration , the skills and values Pyle imparted to his students , and the legacy carried on by N.C. , Andrew , and Jamie Wyeth . <p> At the height of his career , Pyle was an internationally known magazine and book illustrator . He is best known for the accuracy , detail , and sense of drama he brought to subjects ranging from the Middle Ages and American history  --  especially the Revolution and the Civil War  --  to scenes evoking adventure , notably involving pirates . Interested in the philosophy of Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg , Pyle enhanced the sense of fantasy in his work and explored affinities between the spiritual and natural worlds . <p> Assessments of Pyle often overlook the fact that he first created a work of fine art  --  a pen-and-ink sketch , wash drawing , or oil painting  --  which was then turned into the illustrations for which he is celebrated . " He was a much more brilliant technician than had been assumed , says James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which owns a number of works by Pyle . " He was a very good painter " says Jeannette M. Toohey , curator for collections at the Delaware Art Museum . " He had a genius for composition , for picking the right moment in a story and finding a method to communicate its drama . " <p> Besides his indefatigable work on illustrations , Pyle was also deeply committed to educating future practitioners in the field , where he felt American vigor and creativity could establish international preeminence . In the early 1890s he launched the nation 's first formal program in illustration at Philadelphia 's Drexel Institute of Art , Science , and Industry . After a few years , he decided to teach only carefully selected students in friendly , informal settings of his own tuition-free art school , which he established in studios in Wilmington and , in the summer , in nearby Chadds Ford . <p> As the leading illustrator of the day , Pyle had immediate credibility with his pupils . But it was his charisma , enthusiasm , and energy that motivated his students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhilarating experience . <p> " It was not so much the actual things he taught us as contact with his personality that really counted , " recalled Maxfield Parrish , an early Pyle pupil . " Somehow , after a talk with him you felt inspired to go out and do great things , and wondered by what magiche did it . " <p> Pyle stressed the importance of mastering the techniques of fine art . According to him , " good illustration had to be good art , " notes Toohey . Pyle emphasized the necessity for artists to depict subjects they knew well , adding that good composition , historical accuracy , drama , and emotional content could augment things about which they were knowledgeable . " Lire in your pictures , " Pyle exhorted his students . " Throw your heart into your pictures and leap in after it ... feel the wind and rain on your skin when you paint it . " <p> The standout among Pyle 's proteges was N.C. Wyeth ( 1882-1945 ) , a rugged , imaginative New Englander who blossomed so rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illustration of a bucking bronco and rider on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post . In the course of a 40-year career , N.C. completed as many as 2,000 oil paintings and drawings and illustrated over 90 books , such as Treasure Island , Kidnapped , The Boy 's King Arthur , Robin Hood , The Mysterious Island , The Last of the Mohicans , Westward Ho ! , Rip Van Winkle , The Oregon Trail , and The Yearling , as well as innumerable magazine articles and advertisements . <p> Blending Pyle 's emphasis on action with his own creativity , sense of fantasy , and love of nature , N.C. 's vibrant compositions epitomized the best of illustration in their powerful colors , dramatic lighting , and simplified but exaggerated figures . For sheer size , technical brilliance , and narrative power , his illustrations have yet to be equaled . They set standards by which all illustrations are measured to this day . " Pa lifted illustration into something it had never been before , " says his son Andrew . " He transformed the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a full-time easel painter but he was killed in an accident at the age of 63 . By that rime , however , his son Andrew had begun establishing a remarkable career as a fine artist . Now 81 , he has alternated among free-flowing watercolors , drybrush work , and precise temperas in muted , probing depictions of man and land in Maine and Pennsylvania , where he maintains homes . Some of his paintings , such as Christina 's World and his series depicting Helga Testorf , have made him America 's best-known and best-loved artist , much to the chagrin of his detractors in the art establishment . <p> Powerfully influenced by his larger-than-life father , Andrew has nonetheless charted his own course , eschewing illustration for somber , realistic pictures filled with ominous undercurrents of anxiety or potential menace . His earth-toned palette lends itself to the austere , intimate , and introspective works that have connected with the American psyche and made him enormously popular with the public . <p> Andrew 's son Jamie , 52 , tutored at home like his father , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong brushwork , bold colors , creative compositions , and a profound understanding of his subject matter to produce oil paintings reminiscent of his grandfather 's work . Jamie 's two forays into illustration , masterly pen-and-ink drawings for The Stray , a charming fable of Chadds Ford written by his mother , and sumptuous and amusing oil paintings to accompany a children 's book , Cabbages and Kings , by Elizabeth Seabrook , are eerily similar to his grandfather 's illustration oeuvre . <p> The " Wondrous Strange " exhibition beautifully documents the techniques and themes of imagination , romance , fantasy , whimsy , and mystery that link the work of Pyle and three generations of Wyeth artists . Although all four painters have relied on closely observed detail and can be classified as realists , the fact that their creative vision invokes things wonderful , strange , and dreamlike gives their work distinctive appeal . <p> Pyle 's penchant for placing the viewer in the middle of the unfolding drama  --  augmented by careful positioning of figures and the ability to capture the excitement of the moment  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , in Pyle 's The Fight Oh Lexington Common we stand on the flank of the Minute Men as they exchange fire with nearby Redcoats , while the tilted perspective , swirling winds and raging ocean make us feel we are sharing the slanting poop deck with the figure in The Flying Dutchman . The viewer is practically made a part of the circle of pirates intently dividing their plunder on the beach in So the Treasure Was Divided , and the terror of the Salem doctor is palpable as he dashes headlong toward us in The Wolf and Dr. Wilkinson . <p> In a similar vein , we sense the helplessness of N.C. Wyeth 's Blind Pew as he tap-taps his way toward us from the old inn . An illustration for Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island , this riveting picture is perhaps the finest of all American illustrations . N.C. also has us share the frightening predicament of the survivor clinging to a spar in The Wreck of the " Covenant . " <p> In Andrew 's Trodden Weed , our vantage point in the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , which may represent death indiscriminately crushing life underfoot . Similarly , in Jamie 's The Rookery , the combative reaction of the birds makes us feel like intruders in their rocky domain . <p> Pyle 's masterly manipulation of light and shadow , particularly in nocturnal scenes , has been carried on by the Wyeths to achieve similarly theatrical effects . Pyle 's placement of the golden orb of the moon behind the wolf as it pursues Dr. Wilkinson heightens the urgency of the moment , while Old Pew 's plight is underscored by the dramatic shadows he casts in the bright moonlight . The moon portrait in Andrew 's Moon Madness is at once riveting , beautiful , and somehow unsettling . The eerie glow from the skies adds mystery to the strange , birdlike figure in the War of 1812 tunic in Jamie 's memorable Meteor Shower . <p> Another artistic device favored by these artists is artificial light , whether supplied by candles , a headlamp , or other sources . Light from unseen sources dramatizes N.C 's Black Spot and contributes to its sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and enhance the eerie atmosphere around the pumpkin faces in Andrew 's Jack-Be-Nimble . <p> By virtue of their roles as illustrators , Pyle and N.C. were committed to clarity in their work . Andrew and Jamie , by contrast , frequently create detailed , representational images that contain hidden , ambiguous meanings . Offering mystery rather than certainty in their art , father and son suggest the power of the unseen . For instance , the profoundly unsettling strangeness surrounding the figure emerging from the mound of melting snow and ice in Andrew 's Spring is enhanced by uncertainty as to whether the man is sleeping or dead . Similarly , in the wonderful image of Andrew 's friend Walt Anderson recumbent in a dory in Adrifi , it is not clear whether the old salt is dead or alive . <p> Jamie leaves us guessing about the meaning of The Wanderer , featuring a young man in that authentic War of 1812 uniform gazing from the island where the artist lives toward the lights of the mid-coast Maine town Tenants Harbor . Linking all four artists , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to N.C. , then to Andrew , and now to Jamie . <p> Pyle 's legacy , embodied in his own work and compositional devices , deserves the recognition . Pyle once wrote , " I know of no better legacy a man can leave to the world than that he had aided others to labor at an art so beautiful as that to which I have devoted my life . " He would be pleased to know that his approach to picture-making is alive in the work of the Wyeths and admired by thousands . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Wreck of the " Covenant , " by N.C.
