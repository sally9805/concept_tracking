From a window near her cell , Jean Harris can watch as the seagulls that circle the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility sail over the 12-foot fences topped with razor wire and swoop down among the prison 's cinder-block and redbrick buildings . Watching the birds , she says , " leaves you suspecting that if you do n't think you 're a prisoner , then maybe you are n't one . The trick is just to keep looking up . " After 11 years in the maximum-security prison 40 miles north of Manhattan in New York 's Westchester County , Harris has learned to treasure such artifice . Serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for the 1980 shooting death of Dr. Herman Tarnower , her longtime lover and the creator of the celebrated Scarsdale Diet , Harris , 68 , is four years away from being eligible for parole and light-years from the life she once led as headmistress of the exclusive Madeira School for girls in McLean , Va . But Harris , who describes prison as a place where " good is bad and black is white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for bitterness . " You find very quickly in here that you 've been one of the lucky one , " she says . " To sit around and nurse your wounds just makes you look like an idiot . " Instead , Harris , the mother of two grown sons , fills her days teaching parenting classes to the pregnant women and new mothers among her 690 fellow inmates . She spends six hours a day caring for the infants in the prison nursery ( inmates are allowed to keep infants under 12 months of age at the prison ) and also helps Sister Elaine Roulet , founder of the prison 's children 's center , organize a summer visiting program in which local families host children of inmates . " You 're lucky if you find a place where you can do some things that are useful , " she says . Her other outlet is writing . In her tenure at Bedford Hills , she has written three books , the latest of which , Marking Time , is a heart-wrenching collection of letters she wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris 's trial ( her book Very Much a Lady detailed Harris 's relationship with Tarnower ) and became fast friends . " Jean 's emotional strength is so powerful , " says Alexander , who is currently teaching advanced nonfiction at the University of Southern California . " She did n't have that in the beginning . She just cried all the time . " Written between January 1989 and February 1991 , the letters roughly chronicle Harris 's life between New York Gov . Mario Cuomo 's second and third refusals to grant her an early appearance before the parole board  --  a sore point with her supporters . While revealing Harris 's bouts of frustration and despondency over her failing health ( she has suffered two heart attacks during her time at Bedford Hills ) , the letters also paint a tragic portrait of her fellow inmates and their children . Says Harris : " I know a hundred women who make Job look like a crybaby . " Galvanized by what she has seen in prison  --  a woman who , along with her infant , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her 14 children when she was raped at the age of 10  --  Harris has become a crusader for the care and education of children . She has written Barbara Bush to encourage passage of national child care legislation ( the First Lady wrote back offering her support ) , sent information on the Bedford Hills children 's programs to other prisons around the country and studied everything she could about child development . " I hope that people will listen to some of the things I say about babies when I get out of here , " she says . " It 's illogical to be so careless about our children . It 's coming back to haunt us . " As close as she is to the infants at Bedford Hills , Harris says that most of her fellow inmates remain strangers . " We 've sort of gotten used to one another , " she says . " Most of them have a lot of respect for their grandmothers , and I 'm the closest thing to a grandmother around . " As for her own children ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in 1965 ) , Jim , 38 , owns a property management business on Long Island , and David , 41 , a banker , lives in nearby Connecticut . Both visit their mother frequently . Although she lives on an honor floor , " the cleanest and brightest housing " at Bedford Hills , Harris says that prison life can be grim . Up each morning at 5:30 for the first of the day 's many head counts , Harris works in the nursery until 4 P.M. , when she returns to her 6-foot by 10-foot cell to read " the mail , the paper , my magazines , anything I can get my hands on . " She can not answer all the thousands of letters she has received since she was put behind bars . Still , the letters have comforted her during her imprisonment . " There are an awful lot of women in this country who have had a lot of tragedy in their lives because of a man they loved , " she says . Harris , who maintains that the shooting of Tarnower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , and the gun went off during a struggle ) , does not like to discuss him . " I 'm sick of seeing book reviews that talk about the famous diet-doc murderess , " she says . " I 've grown far beyond that , and I deserve better . " Harris packs up all the letters she receives and ships them off to be stored at her alma mater , Smith College , in Northampton , Mass . " They do n't have too many people convicted of murder who went to Smith , " she laughs . " The library wanted them . " Almost every evening , Harris has dinner with two other honor-floor inmates in the unit 's rec room . They prepare their meals in a small kitchen shared by 30 to 50 women . " I make the salads and wash the dishes , but they do most of the cooking , " she says . " Until I started eating with these women , I had cereal and toast . " Afterward she watches the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , then has the guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls asleep . " I get out of prison by reading , " she explains . Unsuccessful in their attempts to persuade Cuomo to allow Harris an early parole hearing , her lawyers are now petitioning the U.S. district court to overturn her conviction on grounds that her lawyer  --  Joel Aurnou  --  did not present the argument that Harris was severely emotionally disturbed at the time of the shooting . A hearing is expected next spring , but Harris is n't getting her hopes up . " I 'd have to be an idiot to be optimistic , " she says . " I 've lost every appeal unanimously . " Sometimes , though , Harris does let herself dream about what life will be like when she is finally able to leave Bedford Hills . She has a cabin in New Hampshire where every fall friends plant crocuses and tulips in the hope that Harris will be home to enjoy them come spring . " I used to lie in bed and redecorate the living room and think about what I was going to do , but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'll worry about that when I get there . If I can just keep breathing long enough . " <p>
