<p> The baseball death sentence everyone expected was handed down yesterday , and the question left hanging in the air was whether yesterday marked the end of only the 1994 season or the end of baseball as we know it . <p> Acting commissioner Bud Selig announced the cancellation of the remainder of the season , including the World Series , after a conference call among owners . The players went on strike on August 12 , but they thought the postseason could have been salvaged if a settlement could have been reached by September 26 . <p> Selig portrayed the decision as a foregone conclusion that any pragmatic thinker would reach , given the lack of progress in talks between players and owners on the game 's financial problems . But to a disgruntled and increasingly distracted public , the end came as a shock . For the first time since 1904 , there will be no World Series . Reason and/or pragmatism can not begin to explain it all . <p> " Baseball games are won and lost because of errors  --  and this will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said former commissioner Peter Ueberroth , who negotiated an end to the 1985 strike after two days . " The losers are the fans , and there is no winner . 1994  --  the season that struck itself out . " <p> Only time will tell how big or bold to make the asterisk in the record books , but let the record reflect that Giants third baseman Matt Williams finished the season with a major league-high 43 home runs , just off a pace that would have seen him break Roger Maris ' record of 61 . With the season officially ended , San Diego 's Tony Gwynn finishes the year batting .394 , the best average since Ted Williams ' .406 in 1941 . A 's pitcher Steve Ontiveros ( 2.65 ) finished with the American League 's best earned-run average . <p> Selig had set last Friday as a deadline for talks aimed at averting the cancellation of the season , and a brief flurry of activity kindled hope that the standoff would end . But when the players ' proposal for a taxation plan that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was quickly rejected on Friday , the end became a virtual certainty . <p> " They rejected it before they had the conference call to let the owners know what the plan was , " A 's catcher Terry Steinbach , also the American League player representative , said yesterday . " Obviously their intent is not to get this situation resolved , but to kind of hold the game hostage . " <p> During the conference call that preceded Selig 's announcement , 26 of 28 owners agreed to the cancellation . Cincinnati owner Marge Schott wanted to have minor-leaguers play the World Series , and Baltimore owner Peter Angelos did not sign the resolution because he favored a few slight changes in wording . <p> " Like a lot of things in life , you anticipate something , fear that it 's coming , hope that it is n't , " Selig said . " And when the day is here , there 's an incredible amount of sadness . " <p> The long-range outlook for the sport was thrown into uncertainty by the failure of negotiations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their differences can be resolved before spring training is scheduled to begin in February . Among the developments that could take place in the coming months : <p> * Baseball could lose its antitrust exemption , which has allowed it to function as a legal monopoly . Rep. Jack Brooks , D-Texas , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , has scheduled a hearing on the exemption for September 22 . <p> President Clinton yesterday said : " I do n't see how we can avoid a serious examination of it in light of what has happened now to the American people . . . if this is just turned into another business in America , then that 's an issue it seems to me that has to be examined . " <p> Baseball players believe that under the existing antitrust exemption , owners have unreasonably restrained competition in the marketplace . Union officials complain that players ca n't take grievances to court . <p> * Owners could unilaterally impose a salary cap . Citing what they say are losses incurred by most franchises because of wildly escalating salaries , owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued economic viability of baseball . Many experts believe the owners will declare a legal impasse with players and announce that they are instating a salary cap . <p> * A new league or leagues could be created . Steinbach , among others , has said he would not be surprised if larger-market teams broke off from the Selig group of owners and formed a new league along with new franchises based in cities like San Diego , Sacramento and St. Petersburg , Fla . <p> " Then Mr. Selig and some of those other owners can have their stadiums and their bats and balls , " Steinbach said . " Tampa/St . Pete has been busting the door down to get a team , so maybe this is their chance . Get a new commissioner . Get some new teams . That would be kind of interesting . " <p> Regardless of what might happen before baseball returns , it 's certain that fans ' loyalty will be tested . After years of viewing the summer game as a sport with a unique place in the American psyche , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost some of its luster . <p> " There are going to be fans that are not going to come back , " Florida Marlins manager Rene Lachemann said yesterday . " It 's that simple . And we ca n't get them back . I 've talked to them . In a certain way , I ca n't blame them . To me it 's probably the darkest day I know in baseball , when you say there 's not going to be a World Series . " <p> QUOTES <p> ' It just goes to show that we humans who are placed in charge of this great game have fouled up substantially '  --  JOHN SCHUERHOLZ , <p> Atlanta Braves <p> general manager <p> ' Both sides deserve each other . . . If I never saw another game , I would not be unhappy about it ' <p> * STANLEY JONES , <p> a fan in Cincinnati <p> ' I do n't think the damage is irreparable .
