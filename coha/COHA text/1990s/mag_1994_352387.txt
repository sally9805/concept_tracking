First , think of a beginner 's guide to philosophy , written by a schoolteacher for teens and young adults . Next , imagine a fantasy novel  --  something like a modern-day version of Through the Looking Glass . Meld these disparate genres , and what do you get ? Well , what you get is an improbable international best seller . <P> To the amazement of its Norwegian author , Jostein Gaarder , 42 , Sophie 's World , subtitled A Novel About the History of Philosophy , has become a runaway hit practically everywhere it has appeared . In the author 's homeland , it has been on the best-seller lists for nearly four years . The novel has been published in 30 countries , including China , Germany , Italy , Japan and South Korea . Late last month Farrar , Straus &; Giroux issued an English version in the U.S. ( 403 pages ; $19 ) . Despite reviews that were mixed at best , the first edition of 50,000 copies sold out in less than two weeks . <P> Sophie Amundsen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-year-old schoolgirl who lives with her mother in an ordinary Norwegian suburb . ( Her dad captains an oil tanker and is away most of the time . ) One day Sophie gets an unsigned letter in the mail containing only a three-word question : " Who are you ? " Soon she receives another anonymous message , asking , " Where did the world come from ? " <P> As Sophie ponders these questions , a three-page typewritten letter arrives , also unsigned , that turns out to be the first lesson in a course on the history of philosophy . At first by letter and then in person , a mysterious guru who calls himself Alberto Knox guides Sophie through the ideas of great thinkers , from the pre-Socratics to Jean-Paul Sartre . Philosophy 's quest for truth , Knox tells his pupil , " resembles a detective story . " <P> Meanwhile , Sophie has to play detective on another front . From time to time she gets postcards that are intended for another 14-year-old , Hilde Moller Knag , who by coincidence also has an absentee father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is this Hilde ? Why is her mail addressed to Sophie ? And is it just coincidence that Hilde and Sophie have the same birthday ? Suffice it to say that the answers involve a talking dog and a magic mirror , as well as the relation of illusion to reality , free will vs. predetermination and  --  shades of Pirandello  --  fictional characters seeking to escape their author 's plot . <P> Gaarder , who is married and the father of two sons ages 10 and 18 , teaches at a high school in Oslo . He wrote Sophie 's World to fill a gap . Stores were full of New Age pap and other mystical mush , but there were no books that would introduce young people to serious philosophy . By trying to blend fantasy with head-cracking summaries of deep thought , Gaarder feared that he had " sat down between two stools . But I was mistaken . Sophie 's World fell on top of all the stools . "                 @ @ @ @
