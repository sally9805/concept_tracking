At Sun Valley , skiing well is still the best revenge <p> It was polite of Jack to compare my skiing technique to windshield wipers in action . If , like me , you learned to ski a couple decades ago , you might have even taken it as a compliment . Ah , vadling , the height of sporting chic , is it not ? And how dashing to sit back a la Killy . Those were the nice old days , were they not ? Before gonzo snowboarding and helicoptering to forbidding peaks and going to extremes , back when the most dangerous thing a skier could do was hang around Claudine Longet . <p> But what Jack was really suggesting as we rode up a high-speed chair lift on Bald Mountain , the main at action at Sun Valley Idaho , was that my to-and-fro downhill style was absurdly out of date . Skiing had definitely gone hip-hop , while I was still dying to disco . Jack Holt is an instructor at Sun Valley 's ski school , which is widely acknowledged to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays the sport is all about carving . And so , leading me through a series of humbling slopeside drills , he got me to use my edges and work my feet independently of one another . Now and then , it clicked , and I grasped anew Buckminster Fuller 's definition of skiing as " valving gravity . " Other times , even Baldy 's fabled grooming could n't keep me from blowing a gasket . <p> Although you must be positively bursting to hear all about my ski lessons , the truth is that my mid-January trip was rather like an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical . The fact that the plot was drearily predictable ride up , ski down , repeat  --  hardly mattered , the special effects were so dazzling . Founded in 1935 with a young Averell Harriman 's railroad fortune , the resort had not only the country 's first chair lift , it also had an ace public-relations man in Steve Hannagan , who did n't want to discourage fellow snow-haters from vacationing in the Sawtooth Mountains in the dead of winter . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it " society 's newest winter playground " and calculated that the lodge held " as fancy a crew of rich socialites as have ever been assembled under one roof in the U.S. " Then the campy 1941 Glenn Miller romance Sun Valley Serenade ( rent it for the snowy vistas and perhaps the best recording of " Chattanooga Choo-choo " on celluloid ) iced its reputation for elegant frolicking . <p> The sprawling resort , which also includes Dollar Mountain ( ideal for beginning skiers ) and a self-contained village , is located in Ketchum , a once-rugged town that seems largely populated by urban castaways who discovered the place about two years ago and now complain loudly about the tourists . Still , Sun Valley has none of the mobbed frat-party atmosphere of certain other Western ski destinations , thanks partly to its isolation , being 150 miles from Boise , the nearest big city . And a multi-mil-lion-dollar modernization of Baldy over the last few years  --  six new chair lifts and three new lodges , among other things  --  has helped disperse the pilgrims over 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when snow and sky were sublime , the wait at the main chair lift was no longer than five minutes . Locals say the mountain is most crowded in mid- to late February . <p> With barely a novice slope , with long , sweeping , fairly steep intermediate runs , with virtually none of the flats that mar other big resorts , and with bumps and snow fields aplenty , Baldy is not for posing but for serious skiing ( not to mention snowboarding ) . One weather-beaten ski-race coach conceded to me that Vail had more reliable snow-fall and steeper steeps , and he said other mountains might have somewhat more variety , but Baldy 's relative quietude , superb grooming and snow-making , and unceasing verticals compensated for its trifling deficiencies . Another devotee , an ex-racer , said that when he worked for one of the powder-blessed Utah ski resorts , he spent his winter vacation at Baldy to get away from the deeps and revel ingiant-slalom heaven . He now works for Sun Valley . <p> The mountain 's amenities stretch from the boxes of facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new day lodge atop the 8,600-foot Seattle Ridge . One of the world 's largest summit lodges , it has massive timbers , a towering ceiling and glass walls  --  doubly breathtaking , what with the thin air at that altitude . The menu transcends the standard resort fare of chili glop and heating-lamp burgers with mesquite-grilled chicken and fettuccine prima vera . The original summit lodge , a half-century-old place called the Roundhouse , is no longer at the summit  --  lifts and trails having long ago opened the terrain above it  --  but it has an inviting , spare charm and a central open fireplace . <p> Of course , dozens of hotels have sprung up in and around Ketchum since Glenn Miller 's " It Happened In Sun Valley " hit the charts , and a number of condominiums sit right at Baldy 's base , but the Sun Valley Lodge is still the only place to stay if you 're a sucker for style . Like Baldy , this stolid original has lately undergone a multi-mil-lion-dollar face-lift . The rooms are cheerful , with oceanic down comforters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children , the skating rink and bowling alley will divert them giddily . The formal dining room is still a cure for the Depression ; vast , multi-leveled , amply chande-liered , a dazzle with white-clothed tables , it 's much grander than the mean times we live in . Sitting in a red-leather banquette , I listened to a jazz trio while I scampered through a bed of Oysters Rockefeller and dove into a stack of roasted Idaho lamb chops that were far , far better than they had a right to be . Everything but my fellow diners , who were mostly clad in middle-age 's grunge , fulfilled the splendid promise of the occasion . A few years ago , the dining room 's jacket-only policy was abandoned , Americans having lost the knack for dressing on vacation , and the only things that prevented that line of thought from turning ugly were the brandy , book and cigar I enjoyed after my meal by a fire in the second-floor lounge . <p> Now that skiing is such a rough-and-tumble affair , throaty " cowabungas " piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lodge 's famed outdoor pool after a day on Baldy was all the more delicious . A waitress appeared through the condensation fog to take my cocktail order . The sunset glowed on Dollar Mountain . Though I was wet , the martini was dry .
