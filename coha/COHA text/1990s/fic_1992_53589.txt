THIS WAS LONG AGO , or what feels like long ago . I had two strong legs then . A young woman I knew disliked her thighs . She believed they were too large . Her body was small , and she was athletic , and I told her she could not lose weight from only her thighs . She was nineteen , and was running two miles a day . I was forty-one , and sometimes I ran with her . One day we ran five miles ; she had never run that far , and I teased her about her youth , my age . We ran on a country road past houses , a large pond , and long stretches of woods . In my car I had measured this road ; I knew at which house or curve or hill each new mile began . Sometimes we drove to a lake where a five-and-a-half mile dirt trail went around the water , through woods and up long hills . On one of my birthdays we ran eleven miles ; I used to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One day when she was sad about her thighs , I said to her : You have wonderful legs ; I 've seen you run , swim , water-ski , cross-country ski , dance ; and you ski downhill . You should be grateful that you have your legs . I do not remember ever feeling grateful for mine . For over two decades before I met this woman , I ran for the joy and catharsis of it , and I used to say I had legs like trees . <p> <p> By ANDRE DUBUS <p>
