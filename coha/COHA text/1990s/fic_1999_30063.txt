Starfighters swarmed from the sides of the Mon Calamari cruiser Mon Remonda like insects from a deep-space nest . They formed up in four groups -- two X-wing , one A-wing , one B-wing  --  and descended toward Levian Two , the world Mon Remonda now orbited . From this altitude , it seemed stony and orange and impossibly inhospitable , but the comm chatter the pilots were picking up suggested otherwise . " Entering Delta Sector . More of the same . I 'll map-flag locations of survivors . " " Ravine Six here . Repulsorlift is out . I 'm going to have to attempt a high-speed landing . " " Ravine Six , switch to ten-oh-three . You 've got your own controller standing by . " " Beta Sector Base , this is Beta Ten . I read unknowns descending , four groups . " " Beta Ten , this is Base . There are some TIEs in the unknowns but they 're mostly friendlies . " Wedge sighed and activated his comm unit . " Beta Sector Base , this is Rogue Leader . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squadrons in descent to your position . Looks like we 're a little late to the party . " " ' Fraid so , Rogue Leader . You 've missed a Raptor raid . They blasted out of here half an hour ago . We 've got settlements and facilities hit all over this hemisphere . Could we interest you in some search-and-rescue action ? " " Glad to oblige . Give us vectors for twenty search pairs and we 'll get on it . " " Ships dropping out of hyperspace ! " It was Mon Remonda 's sensor officer , Golorno , a human young enough not to be able to keep his voice level in times of stress . " I count four , five , six capital ships ! " Han Solo abandoned his armature-mounted chair and moved to stand behind Golorno . He turned to his communications officer . " Recall the starfighters now . " Then he leaned over Golorno 's shoulder . " Details , I need details , " he said . " Uh , uh , two Star Destroyers , one Imperial-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . Two light cruisers -- telemetry says probably Carrack-class . At the back of the formation ... " The young officer 's voice dropped . " One Super-class Star Destroyer . " " Iron Fist . " Solo straightened and slapped his hands together . " He 's finally decided to come in for a scrap . " He calculated unit strengths . His flagship was Mon Remonda , one of the most powerful of the Mon Calamari cruisers , and its pilot complement , led by Wedge Antilles , could n't be better . Also in this portion of his fleet were Mon Karren , a Mon Cal cruiser of more normal strength , Tedevium , a frigate recently converted from a training ship back to a combat vessel , and Etherhawk , a Marauder-class corvette that was just one restoration job ahead of being dilapidated . Not nearly enough strength to handle the fleet Zsinj had assembled against him ... but Zsinj did n't know that Solo 's Group 2 was standing by outside the Levian system . One holocomm call and Solo 's strength would be doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call in Group Two , " he ordered . " How long before Zsinj 's force reaches us ? " " Three minutes , sir . " " How long before the starfighters return ? " " They 're grouping . Four or five minutes , sir . " Solo sighed . " Slugging match " was to be the correct phrase for it . An impulse caused him to turn back to the door out of the bridge . As he 'd suspected , Chewbacca was there , just outside , standing by . The Wookiee , who chose to have no official role in the anti-Zsinj group , but preferred to stay near the bridge and Solo , had come up as soon as the tenor of voices from the bridge sounded different . Solo gave him a confident grin . " A second group is dropping out of hyperspace , sir ! " Solo whipped around to stare at the sensor screen again . It was broadening , updating  --  the data stream at the bottom indicated that the sensor screen was being supplemented by information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far side of Levian Two . Telemetry indicated that the new force included two Star Destroyers , two Dreadnaughts , a light cruiser , and a Lancer-class frigate  --  a vessel designed especially to assault swarms of starfighters . " We 're in trouble , " Solo said . Golorno turned to look up at Solo . He was n't able to mask his fear . Solo gave him a reassuring half grin . " Do n't worry . I know when to dump my cargo and run . " He turned to the navigator . " Set us a course out of here . What 's the closest path to get us out of Levian Two 's gravity well ? " The Mon Calamari navigator consulted his board . " Directly through the Super Star Destroyer 's force , sir . " " Figures . Make that our primary course . Pass it on to our group . " " Done , sir . " " Communications , revise my order to Group Two . Tell them to be on course and ready for a jump at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " He turned to Captain Onoma , a Mon Calamari male with salmon-colored skin . " Captain , take us out . " " Yes , sir . " " Third hostile group dropping out of hyperspace ! " Solo turned to look , disbelieving , at Golorno . " You have got to be kidding . " * * * Wedge Antilles stood his X-wing on its tail and blasted toward the sky . He 'd sent Polearm Squadron , the A-wing unit commanded by Captain Todra Mayn , on ahead . There was little tactical sense in keeping the faster craft back with the X-wings and B-wings . Now Wedge led Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron in escorting Nova Squadron , the B-wing unit . Sensor data arriving from Mon Remonda showed Solo 's group closing slowly on a unit of six capital ships . The Mon Cal cruiser was already swarming with enemy starfighters , and defenders from Mon Karren and Tedevium . Wedge added up the numbers on that . Those two ships could field five squadrons of starfighters between them . The enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were enemies coming up from behind -- as Wedge 's squadrons cleared the atmosphere , his sensors picked up two additional groups of capital ships chasing Solo 's force . This was not going to be good . Wedge wondered if Baron Fel was among the starfighter pilots assaulting Mon Remonda . Soontir Fel was one of the greatest pilots ever to emerge from the Imperial Academy , one of the greatest to have flown with Rogue Squadron  --  and a man who shared a secret with Wedge Antilles . They were brothers-in-law . Only they and a very few others knew that famous Imperial actress Wynssa Starflare was also Wedge 's sister Syal Antilles . Since the disappearance of Fel and Syal several years ago , Wedge had had no news whatsoever of his sister . Now Fel was back , but flying for the wrong side , and there was still no word of Syal . It was a secret Wedge kept very close . One of his own pilots , Face Loran , had even starred in a holodrama with Wynssa Starflare , but Wedge had never confided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his sister . And now , once again , Wedge was rushing into battle with a force that might include Fel , leading to the grim possibility that he might have to shoot down his own brother-in-law ... and perhaps lose any clue Fel might offer to Syal 's fate . Sensors showed that the Iron Fist force had , since the last communication from Mon Remonda , turned about and was now retreating before Han Solo 's force . Wedge nodded . If Zsinj maintained a course toward the planet , his force and Solo 's would blast past one another in a matter of split seconds , exchanging one low-accuracy barrage , and then Zsinj would have to turn his force around to pursue . By retreating before Solo on the shortest course to an area of space where the New Republic fleet could engage their hyperdrives , he prolonged the engagement . Wedge 's squadrons caught up to Mon Remonda , but circled around several kilometers from the Mon Cal cruiser . At this distance , the swarming dogfight between starfighters near the cruiser looked like twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those twinkles were explosions that had once been friends and allies . " S-foils to attack position , " he ordered , and suited action to words by toggling the appropriate switch above his line of sight . His S-foils split and locked into the familiar profile that gave the X-wing its name . " B-wings , you may arm your weapons . " His sensors showed Zsinj 's force spread out before the approaching Mon Remonda . Straightforward tactics ; it meant Mon Remonda could n't expect to make a minor course change to elude a tight group of ships even temporarily . Any minor course change would still send Mon Remonda into the umbrella of enemy ships ; any major course change would allow the pursuit ships to catch up . But this tactic was about to work in Wedge 's favor . They dove in toward Iron Fist 's stern . Sensors showed no starfighter response from the Super Star Destroyer  --  either the remaining squadrons were being slow to scramble , or all squadrons were engaged with Mon Remonda . Then flashes of light emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , and the ball-like detonations of concussion missiles began to fill the space around them . Wedge was rocked by a near miss . " Begin evasive maneuvers , " he said . " X-wings , ready torpedoes . Remember , port engines only . " Pair by pair , his X-wings began a dance , juking and jinking to throw off the aim of the Imperial gunners they so rapidly approached . The B-wings hung back , allowing the X-wings to draw the initial fire . Wedge 's range meter scrolled down below two kilometers , the maximum effective range for his targeting computer . Enemy turbolaser fire increased in intensity  --  and proximity . At fifteen hundred meters , he said , " Launch one , launch two . " He fired , sending paired proton torpedoes toward one of Iron Fist 's stern engines . More blue streaks than he could count emerged from his X-wings , instantly crossing the distance to the destroyer , which was suddenly and brilliantly illuminated by their detonations against the port side of the stern . He looped to port . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thanks , Rogue Leader . " That was the voice of Nova One . " Novas , launch one and begin ion fire . " Blue streaks leaped from the B-wings . Then the ungainly-looking craft continued their dive toward Iron Fist 's engines , their ion cannons sustaining fire against the destroyer 's stern . Wedge wished them success . They were designed to hurt capital ships ; their pilots knew what they were doing . But if Iron Fist called back its starfighters and the Novas did n't notice in time , the entire squad could be lost . Now it was time to meet the weak link of this force : Zsinj 's light cruisers .
