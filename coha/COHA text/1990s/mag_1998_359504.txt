Monday August 31 1998 <P> Most folks are a bit cranky on the first day of the workweek , but their Monday blues are nothing compared with those of the stock market . Last week 's 512-point plunge in the Dow was just the latest jolt to Wall Street ( and international markets ) after the weekend  --  from Oct. 28 , 1929 , to Black Monday in 1987 , to the 554-point dive last Oct. 27 . Indeed , half of the 10 biggest drops in the Dow 's history , both in percentage and point terms , came on Monday , which has been the worst day of the week for stocks over the past four decades . So what , other than coincidence , accounts for the infamous " Monday effect " ? Several academics point to the preceding weekend , which often follows a shaky Friday . That 's when individual investors  --  who do the majority of Monday trading  --  tend to ponder their investments and nervously peruse speculation in Barron 's on Saturday and the big newspaper financial sections on Sunday before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago professor Richard Thaler , put it down to basic psychology . " People are just in bad moods on Mondays , " he says . And the market , we 've come to learn , is only human . <P>  --  By Daniel Eisenberg
