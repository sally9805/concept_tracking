<p> In his 18-year career in the House , Rep. Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) has styled himself a guerrilla commander , a revolutionary general , a corporate chief executive and , earlier this week , a head coach . Now he 's going to try being more of an old-fashioned House speaker . <p> After sometimes resembling Che Guevara , sometimes Knute Rockne , Gingrich , who wanted to tear down the House , described to people close to him this week a role for himself that more closely suggests the late Thomas P. " Tip " O'Neill Jr. , an effective Democratic speaker who prided himself as being " of the House . " <p> Shaken by the near-death experience of an aborted uprising by dissident members and his own lieutenants , Gingrich is redefining his role and setting out to reclaim some of the power and authority he had delegated to others whose trustworthiness has been called into doubt . <p> After six months of removing himself from the day-to-day operations of the House to focus on being more of a national political figure than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pummeled by ethics violations  --  Gingrich intends to become more involved in the daily affairs of the chamber he heads , according to aides and lawmakers who have spoken with him this week . <p> " I 'm the speaker , I 'm in charge , the line of authority is to me , " lawmakers recalled him declaring in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Wednesday morning . <p> He is already spending more time on the House floor during votes , to be available to rank-and-file Republicans to hear their concerns and complaints . <p> Some analysts said a new leadership style may not address what they see as the real problem : the smallest House majority of either party in more than 40 years , which gives any group of 11 GOP lawmakers power over the party 's operational control of the House floor . <p> " He has to control what he can control : his leadership style , " said John J. Pitney Jr. , a Claremont McKenna College political scientist who is a close student of Gingrich . " But even if he 's successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Although hurt and disappointed , Gingrich has had an almost philosophical response to his circumstances , according to colleagues . " If you 're going to be Caesar , " one ally recalled him saying , " you 've got to expect Brutus . " <p> Indeed , defying leaders is nothing new to Gingrich . In 1990 , as House minority whip , he led the opposition to a plan backed by President George Bush and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel ( R-Ill. ) to cut spending and raise taxes . <p> " How can I be upset if somebody votes against the leadership ? " Gingrich remarked earlier this year . " I made a career out of it . " <p> But now Gingrich is the leader being defied . Conservative House Republicans , who make up the bulk of the party 's 228-member majority , complain Gingrich has lost his revolutionary zeal , paying too much attention to the House GOP moderates , who number about 50 or 70 , and compromising too much with President Clinton . <p> As he seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leadership style as often as Hillary Rodham Clinton has changed her hairstyle . <p> " The circumstances keep shifting , so his responses keep shifting , " Pitney said . <p> In the early 1980s , there was Gingrich , the guerrilla leader , who launched hit-and-run attacks on majority Democrats from the back benches of the House . Later there was Gingrich , the revolutionary , who waged war on the accommodationists in the House GOP . Eventually , he took his party to the promised land of a majority . <p> As speaker , Gingrich has variously described himself as a field general , chief executive officer , chairman of the board and head coach . He has periodically retooled his style to address lawmakers ' concerns , only to encounter a new set of problems . <p> The process sometimes left him sounding hurt and bewildered . " I was told for several months there was too much centralized control , there was too much leadership dictating , that people needed time to sort their own way , " he said in March . " Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told people did n't quite understand the direction . " <p> But , as Shakespeare wrote , " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars but in ourselves . " The fundamental problem , some observers say , is Gingrich 's lack of discipline and short attention span . <p> " He gets into trouble and he changes his style , but ultimately it has to do with his basic chemistry , " said Stephen Hess , a Brookings Institution scholar . " It seems he understands what he should be doing , but he 's incapable of doing it for the long pull . " <p> Gingrich 's models are an eclectic mix of business and military figures . He recommends that colleagues read Peter F. Drucker 's " The Effective Executive , " cites the work of quality control guru W. Edwards Deming and has his staff study the planning methods of the U.S. Army . He 's studied Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 's command of allied forces in Europe , George C. Marshall 's efforts to rebuild postwar Europe and Alfred P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men , though , went through the series of crises that have beset Gingrich , from the political backlash of the two partial government shutdowns to his admission that he broke House rules , for which he was reprimanded and penalized $ 300,000 . <p> Indeed , his career has been marked by daring disaster , by pushing the envelope and testing the limits  --  and prevailing . <p> " He did n't get to where he is today by playing safe , " Pitney said . " His biography would be called ' The Life of Living Dangerously . ' " <p> " When Newt is your leader , you 're riding a roller coaster , " Hess said . " It 's fun and it 's scary , but it can also be frustrating . " <p> The practical effect of Gingrich 's changes may be to diminish the roles of House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey ( R-Tex. ) and Majority Whip Tom DeLay ( R-Tex . ) . Earlier this year , the speaker took control of efforts to communicate the House GOP 's message from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All three have acknowledged entertaining discussions of ousting Gingrich , to various degrees . Many lawmakers predicted challenges to all of them if they seek new terms in their posts after the 1998 elections , if not before . <p> Disappointed in a leadership team that participated in discussions of overthrowing him rather than warning him of the threat , Gingrich will increasingly turn to an informal collection of trusted colleagues outside the upper echelon for advice and counsel . <p> " The leadership will still operate functionally , " said one lawmaker who has discussed the matter with Gingrich . " Armey will still manage the floor and DeLay will still count votes , but he wo n't confide in them or strategize with him . " <p> The goal is to improve communication between rank-and-file lawmakers and the speaker , aides said . Creating an unofficial advisory group also would have the effect of creating a network that Gingrich could use to bypass DeLay 's whip organization , the leadership 's official communications conduit with the rank-and-file . <p> Meanwhile , signs of tensions among leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity after a special meeting of House Republicans Wednesday night . <p> During a telephone conference call with Texas reporters Thursday , Armey responded to a question about his relations with DeLay , which have been further strained by the leadership intrigue , with a long silence . <p> " Sorry , " he finally said , " I dropped my receiver . " Later in the call , he said : " Tom DeLay and I will get along just fine . " <p> And rank-and-file lawmakers said they are still mistrustful of Armey , DeLay and Boehner , who apologized to House Republicans and Gingrich for not moving to stop the plot against the speaker sooner . <p> " It 's all right for their words , " said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert ( R-N.Y. ) , " but we have to see the deeds . "
