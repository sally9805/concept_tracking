<p> THE moment Velarian Francis , a fourth grader , reached the top of the rocky hill , swiveled the high-powered telescope onto the marsh below and shouted , " I see little bugs ! " the New York Botanical Garden 's new Everett Children 's Adventure Garden leaped to the forefront of children 's education . <p> " Children need natural environments they can get their hands on , explore , discover things about , " said Robin C. Moore , a landscape architect and designer of children 's environments . " I think the adventure garden is breaking new ground . I 'm not aware of any other environment like this in a botanical garden . " <p> The $9 million , 12-acre Everett Children 's Adventure Garden , which opens officially on Saturday , is the largest and most ambitious children 's education project of its kind . Considered a model by the National Science Foundation , it meanders past a marshy pond and across a bridge into the oldest forest in New York City . Along the way , children can pretend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can learn the difference between petal and stamen , pollen and pistil . ( It is n't a gun . ) They can see a flower the way a bee does  --  with ultraviolet vision  --  so that a stripe on a petal looks like a runway right to the nectary . <p> They can look for frogs in the pond , then examine the water 's teeming life under a microscope in a lab inside an Adirondack-style cottage designed by the architect Richard Dattner . Who needs to go to the Adirondacks when nature is here in the heart of the Bronx ? <p> Last week , 40 children from two elementary schools gave the adventure garden a test run . As they hopped like sparrows over the boulder maze  --  heading for the telescope  --  teachers and designers watched them like hawks . <p> Many minds from the worlds of science and education worked for more than a decade to bring the adventure garden into being . " Back in the late 80 's , the garden went through a master planning process , " said Catherine Eberbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing for children and families who just came through the gate . There was no reason to say , ' Let 's go to the New York Botanical Garden . ' " <p> At the same time , it was obvious that local schoolchildren needed a safe place where they could touch and be touched by nature . From surveys of parents , teachers and children  --  and consultations with experts from England and the United States  --  an ambitious plan emerged . <p> " Some of what we found backed up national research , like girls being less enthusiastic than boys for science , " said Ms. Eberbach , who arrived 10 years ago to design and run the existing children 's garden . " And everybody thought scientists were people in white lab coats . " <p> Other responses exploded some myths . " Parents and teachers thought their children did n't notice , or care about , nature , " she said . " But city kids really value the plants in their neighborhood . They express great sorrow when somebody breaks a limb off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City children who had never had the experience of free play in woods or a stream without their parents ' hanging over every snapping twig . <p> " I 'm part of an international group of researchers who are very concerned about the growing lack of contact between children and the natural environment , " said Mr. Moore , who teaches at North Carolina State University in Raleigh . " This is a very recent phenomenon . Parents are very concerned about letting their children outside , out of fear they 'll be abducted or molested . They worry about them getting injured or killed in traffic . " <p> Such restrictions keep children from making a deep emotional attachment to the natural world , as Mr. Moore and Herb H. Wong say in " Natural Learning : The Life and History of an Environmental Schoolyard " ( MIG Communications , 1997 ) . The book describes 10 years of work with children and teachers in Berkeley , Calif. , in turning an asphalt playground into a natural world with woods , a meadow and a creek . <p> Eileen Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England 's 30,000 elementary schools incorporate natural landscapes into their playgrounds . She sees parents ' sheltering attitudes as restricting children 's personal freedom . " Kids are being more and more denied access to the outdoors , " she said . " They 're taken everywhere by their parents . It 's very controlled and constrained , and I do n't think it 's healthy . " <p> The botanical garden 's research showed that Bronx parents had the same concerns . So the staff designed a natural landscape where young children could set off down the kids-only path through the wildflower meadow , for example , and pretend to get lost , knowing that Mom or Dad , or the teacher , was n't too far away . <p> Near the pond , boys and girls tested their balance by leaping across big pieces of a 100-year-old white oak . " Our mighty oak was split down the middle by lightning last summer , " Ms. Eberbach said . " So we decided to use it in the garden , where kids can study the tree rings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Food Machine , a make-believe rhubarb leaf about the size of a kayak that has all kinds of gizmos to help them understand how plants make food from the sun , water and carbon dioxide . They pushed on bellows to send air through the giant stomata , or holes , in the fiberglass leaf , as a docent explained how oxygen and water are released from the holes during photosynthesis . <p> " How many teachers , with a master 's in education , could explain photosynthesis ? " asked Gregory Long , the president of the New York Botanical Garden . " Like , none . So this is a huge help to them . " <p> While tests ca n't begin to measure the value of what a garden or natural space can mean to children , if their imaginations are sparked and their minds engaged , reading and math scores may rise . " Over all , we have seen increases in science and reading proficiency , " said Sandra Kase , the principal of Claremont Community School in the Bronx , where students grow things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a long association with the botanical garden , with many of its children tilling plots in the family garden there . Mrs. Kase was in on the brainstorming for the adventure garden . <p> The garden 's Adirondack cottage has a sunny lab where children can look at the stomata of a real leaf under a microscope . There is also a herbarium , where students can press a plant onto the same high-quality paper that botanists use . A 15-minute film about plant scientists stars Bronx children and botanists from the botanical garden . The film is a lively look at what plant scientists do : adventurers paddling dugout canoes and climbing trees , they do n't look like nerds at all . <p> Outside the cottage , two fourth graders were trying to get some stuff about seed dispersal straight . " When the flower dies the petals fall off , but the seeds are still there , " Fernando Brito said . <p> " Yeah , " Christopher Correa said . " But then a dog might come by , and the seed sticks to his fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Down the path , other children were building a giant bird 's nest , using long pieces of straw and marsh grass . Real birds ' nests were on display in a case , and out in the marsh , a Canada goose sat on its nest . <p> " It 's hard work being a bird , " said Amina Saunders , 10 , explaining that birds have to use their beaks for house building . <p> Such nonformal education is crucial for learning , experts like Mr. Moore say . " Children live an imaginary life , " he said , " and creating a place where they can have fun in a very free way can motivate them and expand their horizons . " <p> For city children , it 's especially valuable . As Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew put it , " There is a tremendous opportunity in this garden for kids to experience a huge array of everything from career options to taking part in a natural world they might otherwise not know . " He is a keen supporter of gardens in schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test scores . <p> " Are they going to be reading better because there are gardens in schools ? " said Dr. Crew , an avid gardener himself . " I do n't think that 's what it 's all about . Having a broader picture of the natural world is a very important foundation for understanding their own responsibilities , that this is not an island unto itself , that they are connected to other living things for which they can assume responsibility . It profoundly changes their own framework . " <p> The National Science Foundation has given $1 million to the adventure garden as a model for other programs across the country . The program in the Bronx parallels the state science curriculum for elementary schools and includes teacher training workshops , so teachers a little foggy on the parts of a flower can have some hands-on experience . <p> Henry Everett , president of Lexington Associates , an investment partnership , and his wife , Edith Everett , a senior vice president of the securities firm of Gruntal &; Company , have contributed millions of dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corporations and foundations . The whole Children 's Adventure Project , which includes maintenance and endowment of the 10-year-old family garden , as well as the new children 's garden and various trails through the wetlands and woods , totals $15 million . <p> " What you can see growing up here is a whole New York City generation interested in plants , " said Mr. Long , the botanical garden 's president , as he stared out over the pond . " How could you not be interested ? It 's so captivating . " <p> Ms. Eberbach noted that science always begins with looking . " If this is successful , " she said , " it will be because we helped kids start noticing things . If we can get that ' Aha ! This is really cool ! ' we 're on our way . "
