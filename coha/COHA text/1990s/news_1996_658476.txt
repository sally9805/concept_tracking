<p> 1 . DESPERATION , by Stephen King , Viking , $ 27.95 When an oversized cop brutally arrests several travelers driving down a lonely highway in Nevada , they are forced to battle an evil that has wiped out the entire town of Desperation . They face killer creature-inhabited humans and wild desert animals that appeared after an infamous mine shaft was rediscovered . Though the graphic depiction and suspense live up to King 's fame , the novel becomes a weak theological contest between the devil and God , who is presumed to be cruel and evil . By Debbie Hodges . 2 . THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN , by Jacquelyn Mitchard , Viking , $ 23.95 This is a straightforwardly written account of a bizarre misfortune that spawns countless complications . Beth Cappadora , mother of three , decides to take her children along with her for a short trip to her 15th high school reunion . Carrying her infant daughter as she registers at the front desk of a hotel filled with her former classmates , Beth tells seven-year-old Vincent to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realistic portrait of the Cappadora family follows . By Merle Rubin. 3 . THE REGULATORS , by Richard Bachman , Dutton , $ 24.95 Hyped as the last book written by Richard Bachman before his death in 1985 ( Bachman actually is a pen name used by Stephen King ) , this is a deeply disturbing , unsatisfying book . It opens with a tranquil scene of suburban America , but quickly turns violent as innocent children are cold-bloodedly gunned down . It becomes the story of another young child whose supernatural powers must battle an evil entity known as the Regulators . This book lacks the subtlety to be truly horrifying . By Tom Regan . 4 . EXECUTIVE ORDERS , by Tom Clancy , Putnam , $ 27.95 What if a non-politician , cold-war warrior , average family man , and intelligence expert to boot became president ? Clancy 's latest and longest - 874 pp. - offers just such a scenario . Jack Ryan ( however improbably ) is in charge after almost the entire Congress and Cabinet are wiped out . An Iranian plot to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism ca n't redeem frequent one-dimensional political tangents . Clancy has bitten off more than readers can chew . By Jim Bencivenga. 5 . JACK AND JILL , by James Patterson , Little , Brown , $ 24.95 Detective Cross is working out two serial murder plots . One is the killing of black children in southeastern Washington , D.C. , the other high-profile celebrities inside the beltway . Engrossingly written , but with brutally violent descriptions and much foul language . The plot twists take him onto the mean streets and into the corridors of power . The ultimate target is the president . A racially charged subplot challenges different police and media attention to similar crimes with different victims . By Terri Theiss. 6 . TO THE HILT , by Dick Francis , Putnam , $ 24.95 The hilt in question is the hilt of the sword used by Bonnie Prince Charlie himself , entrusted to the care of the family of our hero , Alexander Kinlock . Kinlock , a solitary soul who would rather spend his time on desolate moors painting , finds himself mixed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and his stepfather save his business and protect the great sword . His 35th novel , this is one of Francis 's best tales . And as always there are lots of horses thrown in . By Tom Regan 7 . THE CELESTINE PROPHECY , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 17.95 Well-intended but poorly written , the plot is a cross between " Indiana Jones " and a self-help book . The hero is on a quest for a recently discovered Peruvian manuscript that details the progress of spirituality at the end of the 20th century . At different stages of the journey , he and his fellow searchers discover spiritual " insights , " nine in total . Rather than profound , the book is awash in such cliches such as the need to " become conscious of the coincidences in our lives . " By Yvonne Zipp. 8 . THE LAW OF LOVE , by Laura Esquivel , Crown , $ 25 The author , who charmed readers with her tale of love and cooking in " Like Water for Chocolate , " disappoints with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , the book uses words , music ( it includes a CD ) , and illustrations to tell a convoluted story of how two soul mates travel through their past to be together . Everyone is capable of finding happiness if they let love motivate their actions . But an almost cartoonish plot and paper-thin characters ring hollow . By Christina Nifong 9 . THE RUNAWAY JURY , by John Grisham , Doubleday , $ 26.95 This book has it all : mystery , legal maneuvering , behind-the-scenes views of a trial , jury tampering , and plenty of other skullduggery . Taking a page from today 's headlines , Grisham takes us to Biloxi , on Mississippi 's Gulf Coast , and the latest tobacco trial . It is no civics-textbook trial . Both sides are trying to fix the jury , but that panel seems to have a mind of its own . Grisham draws a finely detailed , realistic picture of the action and the characters . By Lawrence J. GoodricH. 10 . THE LAST DON , by Mario Puzo , Random House , $ 25.95 After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar territory of " The Godfather " and the mafiosi . He weaves an intricate and compelling plot , often told with humor , that involves some 35 characters crisscrossing each other 's lives . Puzo underscores and foreshadows his theme : Don Clericuzio , the head of the most powerful Mafia family , plans to move into legitimate businesses . His path is strewn with corpses , sex , gambling , and betrayal . It is set largely in Las Vegas and Hollywood . By Suman Bandrapalli. 11 . THE TENTH INSIGHT , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 19.95 Redfield 's sequel to his successful bestseller " Celestine Prophecy , " is also a poorly written , thinly disguised allegory . The book centers around the discovery of a 10th Insight that he says is necessary for " implementing these Insights , living them , ... fulfilling destiny " ( and selling more books ) . Redfield dabbles in spiritual healing , reincarnation , energy levels , and dimensional travel . There are glimmers of - forgive the pun - insight , but the whole is a mishmash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SERVANT OF THE BONES , by Anne Rice , Knopf , $ 26 Anne Rice moves out of the bloody world of vampires and witches into the equally macabre domain of demons with this dreary , dismal tale . Azriel , the titular character , was a Jewish man in ancient Babylon when family and priests conspired to turn him into a demon whose primary sin is boring readers to death . A ludicrous premise is compounded by lackluster writing and a ho-hum plot accented by bits of violence and perversity . Even those who enjoy Rice 's usual creepfest will be disappointed . By Yvonne Zipp. 13 . LEGEND , by Jude Deveraux , Pocket Books , $ 23 . This time-travel romp by the well-known romance author is her latest in a number of fantasies on this theme . The end is predictable , but the witty path is enjoyable , and the heroine proves that slightly frumpy is not forlorn . Gorgeous men and chances to change tragic history abound . The tale is peppered with details of culinary delights . The heroine creates great meals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few mentions of sexual activity . Good lazy-day reading . By Terri Theiss. 14 . DIRT : A NOVEL , by Stuart Woods , HarperCollins , $ 24 " Dirt . " It 's an apt title . When a mysterious series of faxes being sent to the media reveals the intimate details and sexual exploits of a prominent gossip columnist and her publisher , they put a dashing retired police detective on the case . Set in New York , amid philandering men clad in Ralph Lauren 's finest and sultry women in Chanel suits , this book has little character development and none of the interesting details that might make its predictable plot more palatable . By Abraham Mclaughlin . 15 . ICON , by Frederick Forsyth , Bantam , $ 24.95 It 's 1999 , and Russia is out of control . A popular ultra- right-wing demagogue is elected to be its next president . Ex-CIA operative Jason Monk and his British colleagues must expose his Hitler-esque manifesto for internal genocide . The first half of the book is dense , bouncing back and forth from present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel is pure present day cloak and dagger . If you can make it through the first section , you 'll probably enjoy the second . By Marianne Le Pelley . Rankings from Publishers Weekly , October 14 , 1996
