<p> Given the history of hockey in Denver , this is kind of fun . <p> For a change , we get to talk about low attendance , plus " troubled " NHL franchises and owners - and not have to include Colorado . <p> It 's like hitting that goal of losing 100 pounds , then hollering at the first cherubic person you see : " Hey , one person to a pair of pants ! " <p> Check it out : <p> Dallas Stars owner Norman Green reportedly owes about $ 70 million to a bank controlled by the province of Alberta and other Canadian interests , which explains why he is on the verge of selling the franchise . He has been seeking $ 85 million - or what Ascent paid for the Nordiques/Avalanche . <p> Even as the maneuvering continues in Manitoba , it seems obvious that the Jets are lame ducks , destined to play in Minneapolis-St . Paul - or anywhere besides Winnipeg - next season . <p> The Hartford Whalers ca n't last much longer in Connecticut , which means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard . <p> Wayne Huizenga wants to sell the Florida Panthers because the club is losing $ 1.4 million a month playing second fiddle to the basketball Heat in the Miami Arena . <p> The mess in Edmonton will only get worse . <p> The Avalanche helped make some dubious history Monday night , playing in front of the Oilers ' smallest NHL crowd . <p> The record lasted 48 hours . <p> When the Oilers shut out Anaheim 2-0 Wednesday , the announced crowd of 9,052 in the Edmonton Coliseum was 332 fewer than the " old " record . <p> One Edmonton columnist wondered out loud when the sports marketing organization the Oilers had hired to help promote the franchise - SRO Partners Inc. of Portland , Ore . - was going to get to work . <p> That firm was founded by former Nuggets executive Jon Spoelstra , who made his reputation by turning the Portland Trail Blazers into one of pro sports ' marketing juggernauts . Spoelstra sold the firm , but still receives some royalties . <p> This is heresy . <p> Having to , ahem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the folks who sniffed haughtily that because the game was NHL hockey , all franchises should have to do is turn on the beer taps , open the doors and watch the seats fill - and if they did n't , no matter how horrible the team , there was something wrong with the town as a " hockey market . " <p> Next season , the Oilers will have some competition from an Edmonton expansion franchise in the Western junior league . That might seem insignificant , but because the tickets will be considerably cheaper , the junior team might drain off some of the hockey dollar , especially from fans disillusioned with the Oilers and their ownership . For example , the type of fan who is in with three friends on a season-ticket package might be able to afford full season tickets for the junior team - and make the switch . <p> The Washington Capitals have sold out only four of their first 10 home games , and have had three gates of fewer than 10,000 . <p> Even though the New Jersey Devils agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 2007 , the Stanley Cup champions are n't selling out - and there is even more second-guessing of the garishly expensive concessions made by New Jersey authorities to the Devils to keep them in the swamp . <p> Gee . And were n't we told that the Meadowlands was going to be the gold mine for hockey ? <p> So much better than Denver ? <p> SPOTLIGHT ON : SCOTT STEVENS , DEVILS DEFENSEMAN <p> No longer a reluctant Devil <p> When he was handed the Stanley Cup June 24 in Byrne Arena , Devils captain Scott Stevens held it up for a moment of celebration . Then , rather than starting the symbolic skate around the rink - an honor that traditionally goes to the man wearing the " C " - Stevens passed the Cup to winger John MacLean , the Devil with the longest tenure with the franchise . Take off , said Stevens . <p> That was typical of the 31-year-old Stevens , arguably the most reliable defenseman in the NHL - and the kind of player who might give the Colorado Avalanche problems Wednesday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stevens showed his adaptability . Because he scored only two goals in 48 games - down from 18 over the previous full season , when he had a team-high 78 points - it was tempting to talk about his relative lack of production . <p> But Stevens had gone along with coach Jacques Lemaire 's notion that the Devils needed him to concentrate on staying back . " I should n't have led the team in scoring , " Stevens said . " My job is defense first . " <p> The approach worked , obviously , since Stevens and the Devils stormed their way through the playoffs . Stevens ' work with defensive partner Ken Daneyko against Eric Lindros and the Flyers ' " Legion of Doom " line in the conference finals was crucial in the Devils ' six-game victory . The soft-spoken Stevens had been rubbed the wrong way from the start by the notoriety and attention that followed Lindros into the league , and he relished the assignment of trying to shut down the Flyers ' big line . " I love it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's very satisfying when you win . " <p> After that series , the Devils , taking advantage of their stifling neutral-ice trap before the rule makers could get around to discouraging the clutching and grabbing tactics for this season , swept the Red Wings in the finals . <p> The twist here was that Stevens had started out as a reluctant member of the Devils . After eight years with the Capitals , he signed a five-year , $ 5 million deal as a free agent with the Blues in July 1990 , bought a home in the St. Louis suburbs and settled in with his wife and daughter . <p> Oops . After the Blues signed free agent Brendan Shanahan away from the Devils , shock waves went through the league when an arbitrator awarded Stevens to New Jersey as compensation Sept. 3 , 1991 . Stevens at first refused to report , but finally gave in shortly before the 1991-92 season . He signed again with the Blues as a free agent in the summer of 1994 , but the Devils matched the four-year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't mind . <p> HOCKEY 101 <p> Rand McNally has n't awarded it a star yet , but Kamloops , British Columbia , is the capital of Canadian major junior hockey . Three times in the last four years , the Kamloops Blazers have won the Memorial Cup tournament . The competing teams come from the Western , Ontario and Quebec leagues , which operate under the umbrella name of the Canadian Hockey League . <p> The 48-team CHL has players as young as 15 and as old as 20 . Even following the influx of Europeans , a majority of NHL players have junior team names on their pedigrees . Among the 14 members of the Colorado Avalanche who came through the CHL , for example , Joe Sakic played for the Swift Current Broncos , Adam Deadmarsh for the Portland Winter Hawks ( one of five U.S.-based franchises , which still have mostly Canadian players ) and Curtis Leschyshyn for the Saskatoon Blades . <p> The CHL leagues conduct drafts of 15-year-olds in their territories , and that 's just a start . Each team has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and future prospects , and teams constantly add and drop players . CHL players not under pro contract are paid on a sliding scale : $ 160 per month for 16-year-olds , up to $ 600 per month for 20-year-olds . <p> The players live with " billet " families . They play pro-length schedules , and almost exclusively ride buses . If they 're still of high-school age , they are enrolled in local schools and do a lot of the work by correspondence . <p> Because the NHL draft age has been 18 , many of the players on CHL rosters already have been drafted by NHL teams . Some of them already have NHL contracts , so they are being paid by those organizations . Others have been drafted and the NHL teams are watching them , seeing if they develop into pro-caliber players . NHL teams retain their rights for two years after the draft . <p> Back to the junior hockey capital for the final example : The best defenseman in the Western League is Kamloops ' Nolan Baumgartner , 19 . Washington 's No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitals . Baumgartner was raised in Calgary , and was playing in Kamloops at age 16 . <p> " It was different at first coming here , " Baumgartner said . " I was changing to a different school and coming to a smaller town . I did n't know anybody and got hurt right off the bat my first year , so I stayed home from the road trips and was pretty lonely . It was a pretty rough time . But after a while you get used to it , and the billets are great at making you feel at home . " <p> And " Kamloops " always will be listed under his name in the Hockey Register . <p> FINAL BUZZER <p> We 'll start with a question that will be answered only in due time : What does the man with his back to the camera in the 1980 photo on the right do for a living in 1995 ? <p> ( If you already know : Shhhhhh ! ) <p> This was perhaps the most bizarre incident in the history of the NHL 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avalanche ) were playing the Rockies in Denver March 20 , 1980 . <p> Five minutes into the game , wingers Bobby Schmautz of the Rockies and Paul Stewart of the Nordiques drew minors for high sticking . After they served their penalties , they jostled again at a faceoff . They waved their sticks threateningly but did n't swing them , and referee Bryan Lewis gave both game misconducts and sent them to the dressing rooms . <p> The trouble had just started . Moments later , Colorado defenseman Trevor Johansen , who astutely figured out what was about to happen , raced across the ice , got a worker to open the gate and tore toward the dressing-room hallway . Both benches emptied , the game stopped and even those of us in the press box scrambled down the stairs to get in on this . <p> Stewart had gone after Schmautz in the hallway , and they had a stick duel right out of a " Zorro " short . Nobody was hurt before security personnel and other players broke it up . Stewart , a Boston native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was angry with some Schmautz on-ice stickwork . <p> " I came after him , yeah , " Stewart said . " I 've only got two eyes , and I 'm not going to let anyone take a run at them with his stick . Hey , even the guys on his own team in Boston said he highsticked his Thanksgiving Day turkey to death . " <p> Schmautz was disdainful of Stewart , who would play in only 21 NHL games and was considered a " goon . " " This is the guy who came up earlier this year and got beat up , and sat in the penalty box giving the ' V ' sign because he 's fulfilled his dream to play in the Boston Garden , " Schmautz said . " I 'd say it was pretty stupid of me to get thrown out of the game with him because we were better off keeping him on the ice . " <p> Today , Stewart is an NHL referee . <p> I am not making that up . <p> Bryan Lewis , the referee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officiating and Stewart 's boss . <p> And know what ? Stewart , who worked the Avalanche 's first game in Denver last month , is a pretty good zebra . He rubs some players and coaches the wrong way because he " yaps " on the ice and is a bit of a showman - a la basketball 's Jake O'Donnell - but he also is respected for having an intuitive feel and judgment about the flow of a game . <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE <p> Ex-Quebec Nordiques president Marcel Aubut - who made megabucks off the sale of the franchise and its shift to Denver - reportedly has been refused service in one Quebec City restaurant and asked to leave at least one other . <p> In other words : No shirt , no shoes , no Nordiques , no service . <p> When Ottawa fired coach Rick Bowness and his assistant , Alain Vigneault , last Monday , there was one survivor of the purge : goalie coach Chico Resch , one of the most popular Colorado Rockies in their tenure in Denver . The Senators also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 32-year-old defenseman Joe Cirella . <p> Mario Lemieux played on back-to-back nights for the Penguins for the first time during his comeback last week , skating against the Rangers in a home-and-home series . Pittsburgh lost both games , but Lemieux had a @x and assist in the second game , on Wednesday night , and said he felt fine . <p> Kings goalie Kelly Hrudey , who suffered a torn ankle ligament before training camp , finally returned to the lineup in a 5-2 road loss to the Islanders Wednesday . The Kingsdefense was awful and Hrudey faced 39 shots , but he did n't look too rusty . " I was very happy that the game had n't Tikkanen said . " I guess it 's just part of the business . " He said Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello " just told me he had too many players . " With his $ 800,000 salary added to one of the highest payrolls in the league , the pressure will be even more intense on general manager Pat Quinn and coach Rick Ley to produce . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of team owner Wayne Huizenga with the post-goal gesture that has caught on in Miami . The Panthers players let the world know about Scott Mellanby 's feat when he killed a rat in the Panthers ' Miami Arena locker room with a stick , and since then , it 's been fashionable to toss plastic rats and - once - live mice on the ice . When Mellanby had a two-goal game , goalie John Vanbiesbrouck told him not to worry about coming up short of a hat trick because it was yes , " a rat trick . " passed me by , as far as speed and what not , " he said . <p> For sale at the FleetCenter stands for $ 79 : A box containing souvenirs from the final game in Boston Garden . What do you get ? A snip of cord from a net and a vial of water , allegedly from the final ice sheet . <p> Want another sign that the St. Louis Blues players - like the Blackhawks and Rangers before them - are n't enamored with coach Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home game against Toronto , and when Keenan went off on referee Terry Gregson after a loss in Maple Leaf Gardens earlier in the week , the response was reminiscent of five guys on the ice standing around after opponents took cheap shots at their goalie . The Blues did n't back up their coach , in other words , essentially saying Gregson was n't the problem . <p> Esa Tikkanen , unloaded by Keenan to the Devils Nov. 1 for a draft pick , barely had time to learn the right exit off the New Jersey Turnpike for the Meadowlands before getting traded again to the Canucks Thursday . " Amazing , just amazing , " Tikkanen said . " I guess it 's just part of the business . " He said Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello " just told me he had too many players . " With his $ 800,000 salary added to one of the highest payrolls in the league , the pressure will be even more intense on general manager Pat Quinn and coach Rick Ley to produce . <p> No , the Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner Wayne Huizenga with the post-goal gesture that has caught on in Miami .
