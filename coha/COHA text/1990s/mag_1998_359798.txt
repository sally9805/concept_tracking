Did Rudolf Nureyev really have a fling with Bobby Kennedy ? This recently surfaced rumor is n't mentioned in the new biography of the most celebrated male ballet dancer of the postwar era . But even so , Nureyev 's list of lovers was quite sufficiently star studded . ( Did they or did n't they ? Only Mick Jagger knows for sure . ) Fortunately , Diane Solway is interested in more than just gossip , and her fact-crammed , plainly written chronicle is the most detailed and dependable account to date of Nureyev 's hectic life . What fails to come through , oddly enough , is his artistry  --  if you never saw him dance , this book wo n't tell you what you missed  --  but the bare facts still make for a riveting read . <P>  --  By Terry Teachout
