Section : Articles When the irresistible force of a free people met the immovable object of the Communist system , Mr. Gorbachev was out of a job . <p> WITH FAILURE of the coup attempt , a page has been turned in the history of the Soviet Union . The country could descend into chaos ; it could make progress toward democracy ; it could even fall victim to another coup . But whatever happens it will not return to Gorbachevism , ' the attempt to free consciousness while preserving the society 's totalitarian institutions intact . History has moved on . The moment for Gorbachev 's foredoomed attempt to combine the uncombinable has passed . <p> The events of the last few months illustrate well the irreconcilability of the interests of the Soviet people and the military - industrial complex . <p> Last October , Gorbachev agreed to the Shatalin plan for shifting the Soviet Union to a market economy in five hundred days . The plan provided for eventually putting 70 per cent of industrial enterprise in private hands . At the last minute , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and the plan was dropped . <p> The scuttling of the Shatalin plan was followed by an attempt to reinforce central planning . This May , however , under pressure from the devastating coal miners ' strike and the victory of Boris Yeltsin in the Russian elections , Gorbachev agreed to the Nine plus One ' plan , under which control over natural resources was to pass to the Republics . It was the prospect of a new Union treaty based on this agreement that pushed the leaders of the military - industrial complex to attempt to seize power . <p> From the very beginning , there was an oversimplified quality to Gorbachev 's reputation in the West as a liberal reformer . Gorbachev was ready to reduce repression and diminish the role of the Party , but the purpose was to modernize the Soviet Union 's state bureaucracy , whose leaders remained members of the Party . <p> This , in turn , was a matter of military necessity . In August 1982 , Israeli pilots flying American F-15 and F-16 airplanes destroyed 81 Syrian MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This disaster was followed by President Reagan 's announcement on March 23 , 1983 , that American technology had reached the point that it would be possible to intercept Soviet missiles before they hit the United States . These developments convinced the Soviet leaders that they had to take the risks of reform . <p> Reform projects had circulated in the higher levels of the Party for years before Gorbachev 's accession to power . Abel Aganbegyan , an early Gorbachev economic advisor , outlined the crisis of the Soviet economy as early as 1962 . Once in power , Gorbachev took it upon himself to push through a reform program ; however , he met total opposition from the all-powerful Party apparatus . Obliged to operate through some other means , Gorbachev decided to recruit the Soviet people themselves , inspiring them with glasnost , the controlled release of truthful information , a decision which was to determine the course of events for the next six years . <p> Much has been written about Gorbachev 's attempts to balance between Left and Right ; in fact , the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision to use democratic passions to defang the Party apparatus in the interests of the state machine . <p> At first , there were attempts to confine glasnost to a Leninist ' framework , but this proved difficult . In the first place , any fixed limits had to be enforced ; this entailed a gift of power to the enforcers , who were the anti-reform forces that Gorbachev had to fight . At the same time , Gorbachev was rapidly pushed by Party recalcitrance and the ever-present threat of a palace coup to develop a second , presidential ' structure of power , which involved semi-free elections to the previously purely formal soviets . This had the effect of creating further possibilities for freedom . The result was that free speech proved impossible to stop and glasnost expanded steadily to demolish the entire fictional world of the ideology . Breaking the Spell <p> THE PROBLEM was that in seeking to change the Soviet Union , Gorbachev approached the Soviet people purely instrumentally . He and other Communist progressives ' could cynically denounce everything that they had previously taught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic spell of the ideology created a spiritual crisis . Soviet citizens awoke to the realization of an enormous breach of trust . <p> The first result was an explosion of nationalism . When it became clear that repression had eased , mass demonstrations took place in Armenia and the Baltics and then spread to virtually every national Republic . In 1989 , the first massive strikes broke out in the Novokuznetsk coal mines ; strikes spread to other coal-mining areas with the speed of a chain reaction , as if Soviet workers were determined to express their anger all at once . <p> The sense of betrayal became all the deeper when Soviet citizens began to realize the truly limited nature of the reforms that Gorbachev had in mind . <p> The first reforms he introduced provided for a degree of autonomy for enterprises . The enterprises were still required to fill state orders , which often accounted for 90 per cent or more of production , but there was now the possibility of selling some of the remaining production at negotiated prices . It also became possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . <p> These changes , however , all took place within the context of central planning ; although they did introduce elements of economic freedom , they in no way changed the status of the state 's bureaucratic machine . What they did do was disorganize the planned economy . Factory directors raised salaries to attract workers and concentrated on expensive items , while cooperatives , forced to pay bribes for scarce supplies , in turn engaged in superexploitation , helping to fuel an explosion of inflation . <p> By last year , it had become obvious that the way out of a fast-deteriorating economic situation was privatization , and particularly the creation of private property in land ; but here the interests of the country came squarely into conflict with those of the military - industrial machine . <p> There had been considerable talk of collective property ' and cooperative property , of joint stock companies run by the workers . But all of these forms of ownership allowed for control and manipulation by the state . In fact , in the case of joint stock companies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more bureaucratic interference rather than less . <p> The institution of private property , on the other hand , would make it possible actually to dissolve the state bureaucracy and to direct resources in some direction other than the military - industrial complex . In the Soviet Union , the share of the national product that goes to wages is 35 per cent , compared to 70 per cent in the West . The difference goes to pay for the Soviet military machine . <p> On the matter of private property , however , Gorbachev refused to yield . At first , he justified his refusal ideologically , describing private property as the basis of the exploitation of man by man ' ' ; with time , he no longer bothered , resisting instead on behalf of the interests he had always served and even trying to stall the implementation of the Shatalin plan ( before dropping it altogether ) by calling for a referendum on the question of private ownership of land . <p> The result was that a serious gap opened up between the consciousness of Soviet citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of their institutions , which continued to be organized on socialist lines . This was a formula for disaster . If , before , the Soviet Union owed its stability to the fact that its pyramidal social and economic structure was reinforced by the imaginary universe of Marxist - Leninist ideology , now consciousness and institutions came into open conflict . <p> The combined pressure of national separatism and the demands for economic autonomy of groups like the coal miners posed a dire threat to the unified economic complex that is critical to military procurement . This intensified the conflict between the bureaucracy and the people and put Gorbachev in the position , even before the coup , of changing positions like a weather cock in a frantic effort to hold on to power . <p> The Soviet Union is now entering the twilight of the Gorbachev period . At this point , Gorbachev is no longer necessary to anyone . The powerful interests which staged the August coup could regroup for a bloodthirsty encore . Or the forces of democratic change could triumph . In neither case would there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant maneuvering , has succeeded in alienating both . <p> Mikhail Gorbachev cut the Soviet Union loose from its previous moorings , and it is now adrift . The best hope for the future is that it will find leaders capable of doing what Gorbachev could not do : put aside tactical considerations and the lust for power and guide it to safe harbor on the basis of fairness and respect for the dignity of man . <p> Cartoon : MACNELLY <p> By DAVID SATTER <p> <p> Mr. Satter , a Soviet specialist , is Hooper fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia and covers the Soviet Union for Reader 's Digest . <p>
