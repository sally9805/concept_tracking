<p> Getting used to new dorm mates and studying for your first round of exams is a full plate for any college freshman . <p> Val Schnurr must also grieve the murder of a friend she 's had since preschool . Fight through lapses in her ability to concentrate . Awaken each morning to a body riddled with 40 scars . And pray for moral guidance as the terror she experienced in the Columbine High School library continues to haunt her in different ways . <p> Please do not refer to her , she asked , as the other girl who might have said ' yes . ' She said she knows what she said that day , bleeding as she crouched on her hands and knees . <p> The rest of the world knows Cassie Bernall as the girl killed after affirming her faith . It 's now unclear if she did . Val , who was shot before she answered yes to believing in God , does n't know . And that is why she has n't said much more . <p> ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her living room over Columbine 's homecoming weekend . ' I do n't want to be famous or deemed anything . I said I believed in God out of respect for myself and respect for God . That 's it . ' <p> After considering her response silently for a few moments , ' frustrated ' is how 18-year-old Val describes her reaction to the legend of Cassie 's last moments . In the days following the shooting , Cassie 's story was repeated around the world , the label ' martyr ' soon a part of it . <p> During those same days , Val lay in a hospital bed , ravaged by shotgun pellets that had entered and exited her body 34 times . Mark and Shari Schnurr held vigil by their daughter 's bedside , and she told them what had happened . How she and Lauren Townsend and three other friends were studying before Advanced Placement English . How she saw the boots and heard the voices of two boys who pointed weapons under the library tables and fired . How she 'd been praying silently when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . How she was saying ' Oh , my God , oh , my God , do n't let me die ' when one of the shooters asked her if she believed in God . <p> Val said yes . He asked her why . She said , ' Because I believe and my parents brought me up that way . ' She said she crawled away as he reloaded . <p> Investigators say Val 's account has remained consistent and was corroborated by others . Investigators told Mark Schnurr that a student who helped authorities retrace the events in the library got physically sick when he realized it was Val 's table , not Cassie 's , that he was pointing out to authorities . <p> ' In the end it does n't really matter who said what , ' Mark Schnurr said . ' What matters to me is my daughter . ' <p> Complex emotions <p> A father 's simple declaration belies the complex emotions and decisions that have faced the Schnurrs for months . <p> The Bernalls , though told by investigators of the conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall . ' Shari Schnurr said she asked the book 's editor not to rush the publication and to wait for more details . <p> But Misty Bernall was eager to share Cassie 's other story , her transformation from a troubled teenager who threatened suicide to a Christ-loving girl eager to share her faith . Editor Chris Zimmerman said he had resolved any inconsistencies to their satisfaction . And so less than five months after the shooting , the book - with an introductory acknowledgment that the ' exact details of Cassie 's death may never be known ' - was released , marketed and titled on the premise that Cassie was shot after affirming her faith . <p> ' Plough gets an A in marketing , an F in research , ' said Mark Schnurr . ' Cassie 's story ( of transformation ) would have been wonderful on its own . ' <p> The book is a best-seller . A copy sent to the Schnurrs remains in its wrapper . They do n't plan to read it , because they know well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several students affected by the nation 's worst school shooting , Val has been asked to speak about her ordeal and has felt compelled to do so . But because her experiences have been less publicized than Cassie 's , Val said she has been accused of being a copycat and her ' real ' relationship with God has been challenged , once at a evangelical youth rally honoring Cassie and shooting victim Rachel Scott . That 's where her frustration was born . <p> ' It 's hard to know what I experienced , to know what I know is real and then have it questioned - that 's hurtful , ' Val said . ' But you just give it up to God . You move on . <p> ' The reason I 'm saying anything about it now is that it 's hard to keep quiet when everyone is talking . So one last time , this is what happened to me . ... I just do n't want anything I say to hurt the Bernalls . ' <p> ' Sincerely apologize ' <p> On Saturday the Bernalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions have hurt or offended anyone , we sincerely apologize . ' <p> Mark and Shari Schnurr , knowing more details of the investigation than Val and having heard the 911 tape of the library carnage , have their own hurdles . They are proud of a brave , strong , God-loving child . They do n't want her to feel victimized yet again . <p> ' We thank God every day we still have her , ' said Shari Schnurr , who still wears a Columbine ribbon . ' Val should be able to tell her story without people doubting her . The issue should n't be about who said what , it should be about kids and their faith . ' <p> The Schnurrs discussed their concerns for Val and the Bernalls with close friends and clergy . <p> ' Staying quiet is n't taking the high road , it 's the right road , ' said Mark Schnurr . ' It keeps our focus on our family . ' <p> The book is not foremost on Val 's mind . But the shooting , and childhood friend Lauren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , rarely leave her thoughts . She was too weak from her own wounds to carry Lauren out of the library . <p> ' I feel survivor 's guilt every day , ' she said . ' It could have been me . She was a good person . ... There 's got to be something to why I 'm still here . ... So I 'm looking for it . ' <p> Her eyes appear moist , but she does not cry . Val is too overwhelmed to say much more about her friend 's death . She e-mails and talks to the Townsend family regularly . <p> On campus at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley , Val has n't said much at all about Columbine . Making new friends usually means answering ' Where you from ? ' and ' What high school ? ' but she says students have generally left it at that , and only those closest to her know she was shot . <p> ' I get more questions from adults . They want to go deeper . They want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And I have a hard time talking to strangers . ' <p> Val had a 3.6 grade-point average at Columbine and was a peer counselor who helped fellow students work through boyfriend-girlfriend issues and teacher problems . She felt she 'd found her niche , and now counseling is her career goal . Perhaps in a school setting . <p> For now , she 's concerned about how she did on that first round of college tests , trying to get involved on campus and find a church to augment the Bible study she has joined . Val was heartened to return for Columbine 's homecoming last weekend and spend it with old friends who did n't bring up the shooting . <p> Val 's eyes light up when asked about college life . She is glad she picked a campus far enough away for independence but close enough to do laundry free and grab hugs from family . The shooting has reinforced how precious her parents and younger sisters are . <p> The mental recovery is more frustrating . Some days she is just down . Sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical pain . Her ability to focus and her attention span have been affected by the trauma as well . <p> ' I 'm doing OK enough that I do n't need to see anyone , ' she said . ' I 've always been pretty strong . ' <p> Her parents nod . Her mother glances into ' the Columbine room , ' a vast swamp of cards , books , get-well posters , newspapers and empty vases . The Schnurrs know well that what touched their daughter has touched the world . That 's why Val and her father have agreed to speak to groups like Adams County mental health workers who are trying to learn from the Columbine tragedy . <p> ' Speaking is nerve-racking , but I feel like it 's something I should do when it arises , ' she said . ' The more opinions out there the better . I do n't want my sisters to go through this one day . ' <p> Samantha , 7 , and Ashley , 11 , slipped in and out of the house quietly Sunday as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing of what looked like a barn for her dorm . After repacking her weekend bag , finding misplaced keys , grabbing some gas money and giving some tight hugs , Val started the 80-minute drive back to Greeley . <p> Her mother cried . <p> The cooler weather , Val said with a laugh as she left , is a good thing . Long sleeves hide the purple scars up and down her arms . The four pellets that left the hospital with her have now been removed , but she still gets infections , still faces more surgery . She is grateful a table brace shielded her face from the gunfire . <p> ' I hate looking at myself , but this is the way it 's going to be . They are getting pinker , ' she said , surveying one arm . ' Is n't it always frustrating to look at yourself in the mirror ? You get through it , you keep going . I 'm alive . <p> ' So I 'll look at them and remember , every day till I die .
