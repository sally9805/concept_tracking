THE BOOK WAS a Luganda grammar . It lay open on the splintery desk Alec Wardlaw had knocked together from their packing crate . It had been open for days to this lesson , to a page where the list was forty-seven words for seemingly surreal bits of the banana plant . Each six-syllable entry was strained into an English equivalent , like " the soft pithy fibers under the first layer of new shoots on second-growth trees only and used as Europeans might use down . " <p> Alec 's gaze was stranded . He broke it and pushed back his chair . Standing at the window , he had hills in front of him instead of words . Farther off he could see snowy peaks . He could smell wet grass , and mostly he could drench himself in the sight of Anna . She was under the thorn tree , on a mat . Her body curved . She leaned on her arm behind her , and sun glinted off her bracelets . Her hair was long . It was clipped in a bunch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow bent and her wrist pressed into the mat . He liked the way her hand curved up . He liked that tilt of her hand almost as much as he liked the way she held her head cocked toward the baby . The baby was staring over the other woman 's shoulder . This was a village woman 's shoulder-Anna learned her Luganda sitting on mats and talking with village women and cocking her head at babies . This particular woman and baby came every afternoon . The woman had never heard of grammar rules . Neither of the two caught what the other was saying . <p> Anna , this woman he kept watching , was his wife . It scared him how strange to him she was . She was southern , he a Boston Yankee . But she 'd said yes to him . She had married him and come to teach in Uganda with him , and she would be here with him , safe , when other people in America would be carbon smudges in homemade backyard shelters . Nobody pretended the Cold War would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down , stared at marks in the book . Then an insight came so strong he grabbed the grammar and abandoned the pantry ( the pantry was his study ) . Halfway over the grass he halted , banged on the book , and called , " I 've had a breakthrough . This stuff is a way of thinking . It is n't a language . " <p> Anna twisted round from the baby and stared at him . <p> He came closer . " I know . I 've acted like it was n't worth the energy . But now everything makes sense . I understand ! We 'll be part of things out here . We can live out here . " <p> Anna said , " That 's sweet , " and let the baby grab her bunch of hair . <p> All right . Anna thought he was funny . He was aware of that . She had a way of patronizing him , and he did not think southern manners made it a gracious way . For instance , yesterday he 'd said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the doorstep-it was the seventeenth petitioner that day-and she 'd suggested he 'd better have stayed in Boston if he liked Luganda grammar books better than Luganda people . Now he felt that mood of hers again . She was bending around , actually contorting herself , to where the village woman could n't see . She grimaced at him . She whispered something he could n't hear . He came up to her , said , " What ? " She frowned and gestured until he made out her objection : he had not greeted the Muganda woman . <p> He obeyed . He nodded toward the woman , began the set Luganda hums and phrases . They went back and forth , back and forth . He had memorized this outside greeting . It took five minutes . He did it almost right but got impatient , snapped off a few hums , spun back to Anna and tried again . She had to understand . He said , " This is a thunderbolt . I 'm going to get along with people here . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different language . I have to look at odd things . That banana tree , for instance " - he bent to catch her arm and pull her up- " come see what I mean . " <p> Anna held stiff . She whispered he was ignoring the woman . He said , " No no , I meant you both . " He sputtered again , halting , with Luganda words . The delay undermined him , made his insight seem shopworn . He broke off what he was saying , shook his head , left them to their prattling and trailed back over the grass . The baby cried . Down the hill a cow lowed . He watched a clutch of tickbirds rise and hover , a fluttering of white , over cattle humps . He thought the humps looked diseased , like the shapes of Chinese mountains . <p> Diseased . He himself was not diseased . But sometimes Anna acted as if he were . They both spoke English , but they might get along better , he considered , if she spoke Greek and he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored the geckos scattering across the wall , dropped the grammar , picked up The Primal Vision : Wisdom from Beyond the West , opened to the page he 'd paper-clipped , and sat motionless , rereading , reconsidering . He began inking an outline of African psychology in the margin , but he halted . He stood at the window , watching Anna . <p> It struck him : he was at last breaking into African thinking , and it was that insight that was giving him a peek into his wife 's murky ways . He saw it : except through anthropology , nobody could get a handle on Anna 's South . <p> They 'd met in overseas training . Not Peace Corps training , but Teachers-for-East-Africa training , which was pre-Peace Corps . It was the same idea , but Teachers for East Africa did n't manage Peace Corpstype publicity , and nobody much knew of it . He 'd taken note of Anna the first hour-she was square-jawed and pretty , and he had n't wasted time . Only , he discovered , you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed the trouble-she was a woman and she was southern and she ranked being pleasing way above anything to do with being truthful . He was not likely to forget the first time this little difference exploded . It was a couple of weeks after they 'd gotten together , and she 'd somehow convinced herself he 'd hurt one of her friends ' feelings . She accused him . He made the mistake of defending himself , saying he was n't going to lie . That innocuous remark had agitated her , in what he did n't think of as a genteel southern style . She said , far too loudly , " Of course a person has to liel What do you mean you do n't lie ? You Yankees think your words are pure , honest , pristine , untouchable . You think it makes not one iota of difference how you say some rudeness-or who you say your pure , true rudeness to . I ca n't believe such arrogance ! It 's as if you think any word you say is a straight , direct window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad-it 's playing God ! " <p> At that first explosion , he still had the buoyancy of spirit to argue with this mystifying woman he loved . Their confusions and negotiations kept coming , of course , but in that early period it could all be settled easily , lightly , with as little as a pet name : " Flatfoot " for him , " Swampy " for her . <p> Now , however , living in Africa , he was being forced to see things differently . Maybe she was right ; maybe you did have to talk to people in their own way of talking . If he learned to do that , maybe she would n't keep thinking his feet were flat . And also , since he was beginning to adapt , they would n't be ostracized out here . <p> At present they were ostracized because their African village turned out not to be a genuine African village at all . It was a born-again African-Christian tyranny : he and Anna were n't welcome because they had n't been washed in the blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers , and Anna would see . She would appreciate he was capable of what she called being " civilized . " <p> They did n't , as a matter of fact , have a choice about getting along . Judging by the bullying over the Berlin Wall , it was unlikely that there would be Americans much longer . Here , already , they 'd had the foresight to get corn and yams in the ground , so the Mountains of the Moon were almost safe , altogether safer than the United States . <p> He settled in the basket chair , flipped through the book for a passage , reread , raised his eyes to the wall and followed a line of ants along the crack . He held still for minutes , contemplating , and he began to grin broadly as he pictured telling her . He could n't wait . He pulled the door open and hurried over the grass . This time he greeted Mrs. Sajjabi . Then he said to Anna , " Listen , it 's all come together . I realize I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some ' authentic ' African culture , and that 's asthmatic thinking . Culture is a hodgepodge . It 's confusion . If we plant in somebody 's dirt we have to get seeds to fit that dirtwe ca n't make dirt to fit our seeds . Like you keep saying , you have to convolute your words around the other person 's convoluted words .... " <p> She was n't listening . She was looking behind him , and she seemed dismayed . He turned . Two heads were bobbing toward them through the elephant grass . <p> With luck the men would n't see him . He bent himself tiny , fled around the back of the house , leaped the few steps , and bounded into his pantry . Softly he closed the door , breathed easier , crossed to the window and watched the scene outside : Mrs. Sajjabi was tying her baby on her back and wisely abandoning the place . Anna was standing beside the thorn tree . Behind her the Mountains of the Moon were like a stagy backdrop . No doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-superpowers would n't find them here . <p> Anna had turned around . She seemed to be looking for him . He ducked further in the shadow of the pantry . She could n't see him now , but he could observe the visitors . These village elders came each week to save Anna and himself from sin . Now the men were emerging into the clearing . Both were wearing Arab kanzus , white beneath their dark wool Western jackets . The tall one , Mr. Wamala , was stern , with a craggy , intellectual face . Both heads , he noted , bent back when they got nearer Anna . Their chests shot out , and he felt their walk go measured and increasingly formal . He watched them bow . They started in on the outdoor standing greeting-that one took up three pages in the grammar . <p> She was leading them inside . But he was strapped : he had two more hours to put in on Luganda , and she was better than he at these things that had to do with people . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , interruptions were already eating him up . He could never justify his job out here if he could n't stick to the simplest discipline of language study . He tensed and frowned at the book in his lap . <p> " Come out , Alec . " Her voice at his door was low and a shade putout . He closed his book . He emerged , taking his glasses off and rubbing his eyes . He kept his finger in the grammar and felt his smile tight on his cheeks . The men got tangled in his indoor seated greeting ; because of the book he held , they had only one of his hands to work with . But then the men stood up , and he smiled a genuine smile : they had changed their mind . They were leaving . <p> It was a brief hope . Anna whispered : " You did n't finish . Give the standing phrases . " He nodded and started the fumbling , and she deserted him . She backed straight out of the room . That meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit on sitting himself down decisively , waving them into that position and talking quickly , ignoring their puzzlement asking about mud bricks for the school . A defect surfaced , however , in their connection : the men seemed to think he was asking about charcoal He turned to the subject of the nightly drumming on their side of the hill . They smiled broadly and nodded yes . They did n't answer , or they had n't caught it was a question . Or maybe he had said the word fo " rock " instead of " drums . " He settled for listening to the cricket under the sofa and willing Anna back in the room , and then he implemented the hope by hopping up and hurrying out to the cooking shed to helF her . With no electricity , she had to boil water on the primus stove Electricity-an hour or two of it at some unpredictable hour of the daywas new in this part of the country . The current had been off for ter days . <p> At last . The mechanics of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dredge up words the two men understood , about when to plant cassava and the like . <p> From nowhere the hanging bulb flicked on , a fan began to whir , and the army-surplus radio shrieked racket . They startled , all four of them , and laughed . Alec sprang across the room , bent under the table to the radio to cut the noise . He stopped . He caught a word , " Khrushchev , " and in another squawking-disappearing spurt of sound , what must have been " Castro . " He banged at the archaic box of a radio-louder gibberish shot out . <p> " It is not good to plant before the rains , " said Mr. Wamala . " The rains must come every afternoon before you can put things in the ground . " <p> Alec spun the knobs another direction . He made out " Soviet ships " in the voice of the BBC . He said to Anna , " So the Cold War 's heating over Cuba . " <p> " Okukuba ? " Mr. Lugira said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " rolled in over the static . <p> Anna said , " Alec , it ca n't come over Cuba , can it ? " <p> " We love the Lord , " Mr. Wamala said . <p> Alec said , " Do n't be a jackass , Anna . Cuba is not Berlin . " <p> " We love the Lord , " Mr. Lugira echoed . <p> Anna said , " We need to get cassava in the ground . " <p> " We have been washed in the blood of the Lamb , " said Mr. Wamala . <p> Alec leaned down into the new din of flamenco music . He banged the box . He strained to catch the bloops of uproar and flapped his hands for them to hush . The BBC said something like " President Kennedy has . . . " and fell back to shrieking . <p> He gave up . He returned to his chair and leaned back . Anna took over the knobs . Behind her , flies settled on the biscuits and the teacups . All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , startled . They had spoken to him ; they were waiting on him . And he had ignored them . Anna kept hinting he ignored people . He backtracked , called up what they 'd said , saw it was time to put his insights into practice . It was now they had to get along out here-who knew what would happen ? He thought , she will see I can break my isolation . If the way surprises her , she will agree when I explain . She will see it 's a new humility in me . These men are our world now . Their culture is our culture now . We have to fit in , and she will see now I can change . <p> He said to the waiting men , " I love the Lord as well . " Mr. Wamala jumped up , as did Mr. Lugira behind him . Anna looked up from the radio and stared . The men broke out in singing-the song reserved for the saved . The radio came through in piercing bursts of something like Chinese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was n't smiling back . The men pulled him to standing . Anna said , " Alec , Alec . " The men sang , " Tekutendereza Jesu . . . " Anna got up and walked out of the house . The men clutched him and shook him . They kept on singing . <p> He pushed himself free . He fled the room and halted out back of the house . He ignored Hezekiah the egg man , smiling and nodding beside the water tank . He looked around . He called Anna , softly at first , then louder . He hushed and listened . Between the screeching pulses of the BBC the insects droned and the grass smell thickened in the sun . He called , " Nedda , nedda " to the egg man , who was holding out his basket . He circled the house . She was nowhere . He yelled . The spurts of static broke off-the power was dead . He spun around . He ran through reeds . He stumbled on her in the rubble behind the outhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and the weeds reached her shoulders . Her head was on her arms . She had to have heard him , but she did n't move . Neither did he . And then he said , " You ca n't worry about Cuba ! But I 'll find out-Samweri has a transistor . " <p> He paused . She did n't stir . He tried again . He said , " If it 's what I told the men , I thought you would understand-I 'm learning to bendI have to bend , we both have to . It ca n't be so bad as you are making out-we have to act like they want us to act . " <p> Her head was still down , and now she pressed it lower under her arms . He talked faster : " Anna , it 's what you know-it 's why you 're wiseit 's how you understand things ! You know you have to say what people want . It 's not betraying anything . It 's not dishonest . It 's being a community , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we , were n't we once-of course we 're saved some way . Maybe it 's you who 's stuck in a culture that has nothing to do with anything out here . Maybe it 's useless , what we got landed with-how we use our words . Words are communal , religion is communal-it 's always been . We 're the strange birds ; these villagers are n't strange . We have to adapt , pay-use words like they do . You have to see that-we have to pay . We have to fit in-do n't you see ? " He paused . He pleaded , " Look at me . " <p> She did not look at him . He adjusted his direction . He said , " Am I wrong ? If it 's Cuba-do n't be feebleminded . Cuba 's not Berlin ! " He took a step closer , stopped , got louder : " Look at me , goddamnit . " <p> She raised her head . But her eyes went over his shoulder , left him nowhere . It was as if things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if wires were scrambled at the birth of things . He was scared . <p> He dared not step any closer . But he bent , from his waist , toward her . He whispered , " Hello . " At that word she looked at him , and when he felt her reconnection his eyes closed in relief and breath seeped back into his body . <p> She said , " It 's not true what I heard you say . It ca n't be true what I heard you say . " <p> He said , " We 've got to live out here , Anna . We 've got to think like people here-you 're the one who knows that . " <p> " I do n't believe you . You use that language-you pick the sickest words they 've taken from the West .... . " <p> He did not stop : " What you say about people-like southerners and northerners-trying to talk , what you say about knowing the rules you 're playing by . . . " <p> She scowled . Quiet welled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands started twitching . He said , " What do I do ? " <p> She looked at his shaking . She looked at his pleading face . She jumped up . She pounded him and kissed his head and said , " Who knows who knows who knows who knows-we 're defectives-we 're uselesswe 're nincompoops out here . Who knows what we will do . " <p> They could hear the men come nearer . They slid closer to the outhouse and pressed their backs against the mud . The men stopped calling . They seemed , in Luganda , to be considering the circumstance with consternation . Alec whispered , " What if they catch us ? " <p> She whispered back , " Say we heard the Cuba news . Say we had to plan our food supply . " Her eyes had a smile , and his eyes caught it . Their heads were pressed flat against the flaking dry-mud outhouse wall , and their senses were keyed to the danger . <p> The valley lay in front of them . The Mountains of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the air , watched the two birds circling each other . They watched till voices petered out , and then they pushed away from the wall and stepped around the rubble . <p> Cautiously they came to the open patch of ground . They had to brave it . They looked both ways , strained for signs of an approaching human being , and they ran . <p>
