<p> PAVE PARADISE AND PUT IN A PARKING LOT <p> Editor  --  I read with alarm your August 10 article on a planned Gold Rush City in San Joaquin County  --  we should pause before we allow so much of our valuable arable land to be paved over . Do we need longer commutes and more traffic congestion ? <p> A theme park only creates wealth for the developers ; people who work in them earn minimum wages . Must we keep constructing huge housing developments that spread across the countryside , just to keep construction workers busy ? Surely housing could be designed that is closer to established business centers and is less destructive to the earth . <p> Developers ' dreams have a way of turning sour . They walk away and the community is left with the acres of asphalt and concrete  --  look at Fashion Island in San Mateo . <p> California should wake up to what is happening and put a stop to urban sprawl . <p> LUCIENNE C. REGAN <p> Burlingame <p> AN AMORPHOUS RIDE <p> Editor  --  Reading the contradictions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Bicycle Coalition head , makes it all the more difficult to understand the point of Critical Mass . <p> Mr. Snyder states , " If it were n't for us , Critical Mass would just be an amorphous ride causing a lot of trouble . . . if cyclists obey traffic laws , they do n't need permits " ( as the police chief has proposed ) , and he says because of the urgency of the issues , they fight their asses off . <p> The July Critical Mass ride was the best illustration of an amorphous ride . That ride had no form or function , which did cause a lot of trouble with many cyclists disobeying traffic laws . <p> So fight for something important , Mr. Snyder . Are n't issues like under- educated kids , homelessness and many others more urgent than riding a bicycle ? <p> Hang tough , City Hall , enforce laws that will keep juvenile bicycle- riding hooligans off the streets , as well as jerk car drivers . <p> BILL WONG <p> Oakland <p> . <p> AN OBSCENITY <p> Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 3 column , Reynolds Holding argues that pornography depicting and encouraging child molestation should be protected under free speech  --  as long as it 's not obscene ! <p> Pornography eroticizing acts of cruelty ( such as raping children ) is the definition of obscenity ; the best definition imaginable . Yet this hate- porn is horribly pervasive . <p> Barely Legal , a magazine put out by Larry Flynt , boasts pictures of naked , very young women , often posing with expressions of fear or confusion . These photos are frequently surrounded by text describing child molestation , sometimes suggesting the victims secretly enjoy it and other times relishing their pain and humiliation . This magazine and countless like it use sex to sell child abuse the way advertisers use sex to sell beer . <p> These hate-porn mags can be found in any liquor store and even some mainstream bookstores . But the same police who 'll stop a 17- year-old from buying Penthouse do nothing about the 40-year-old pedophile buying a magazine designed to feed and nurture his sickness , and to encourage him to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenity here is that the government is going too far in protecting children ? <p> BILL BYSTRICKY <p> Sunnyvale <p> . <p> A FAMILY STORY <p> Editor  --  It is with anger and regret that I write in response to Marya Grambs ' recent interview ( Sunday , August 3 ) with Moira Johnston , author of " Spectral Evidence , " a book on the 1994 lawsuit brought by accused child rapist Gary Ramona against the therapist of his daughter Holly . <p> The timing of this interview 's publication was cunning . Both The Chronicle and the Examiner offered small , well-hidden news articles about George Franklin 's recent lawsuit against his adult daughter , whose recovered memories of George 's murder of her childhood friend led to his conviction in 1989 . Eileen Franklin also remembered being sexually abused by her father . Yet instead of any article about the realities of family violence , you bring us the glorified account of an author who sets about defaming the character of a young incest survivor because , in Johnston 's words , " it was the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incest and ritual abuse are the story of the American family , or of enough families for us to be alarmed and take action  --  not to vilify those who bring it into the light of public scrutiny , as Holly Ramona did . The " destroyed families " the interview mourns are families that are far more likely destroyed by incest than by false accusations of incest . It 's not a " memory war " that should concern us  --  it 's real and widespread sexual violence against children , crossing every boundary of class and culture in this society , and affecting at least 1-in-3 girls and 1- in-7 boys . <p> Bringing media attention to recovered memories of child sexual abuse obscures the underlying issue of the abuse itself . Caving in to the backlash against incest and ritual abuse survivors  --  brought to you by the makers of the backlash against feminism  --  makes a social climate already riddled with taboo more hostile to children and adults who seek to stop the violence in their families . <p> SKYE ALEXANDER <p> San Francisco <p> . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to win a political victory in North Korea , now that its citizens are starving . Your editorial of Sunday , August 10 , horrified me . Its attitude reflects the same hard-line thinking and ignorance that we all condemn in the North Korean leadership . You must know that any North Korean negotiators or spokesmen wo n't be as hungry as the people whose lives they have in their grip . It would be heartless and pointless for the United States to insist on political conditions before giving needed aid . <p> D.G. COLEMAN <p> Castro Valley <p> . <p> WE 'RE CIVILIZED <p> Editor  --  In last Sunday 's ( August 10 ) Washington Insight column , Marc Sandalow 's answer to the " lady " that wrote that Europe was more " civilized " than the United States was great ! I enjoyed every reference , from their toilets to their music and all in between . Especially the " ice , " soccer games and single beds in romantic Greece . <p> I 'm sick and tired of some Americans bad-mouthing the United States . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut up . We have a lot of problems but not as bad as some other " civilized " countries , and they do not have the " mixture " we have . If they did , they would realize the richness of this country and I do n't mean money . We need more " upbeat " columns about our country . Thank you for yours . <p> JOYCE NAYLOR <p> Petaluma <p> . <p> WORDS , WORDS , WORDS <p> Editor  --  L.M. Boyd 's Grab Bag of August 10 listed " undistinguishableness " and " disproportionableness " as the two longest English words ( 21 letters each ) . The Sunday Interview of David Snyder , head of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition , could have described him as an advocate of " disestablishmentarianism " at 24 letters ( Webster 's 3rd New International Dictionary , Unabridged ) . Make that word an adjective by changing the final " m " to " tic , " bringing it to 26 letters . <p> On the other hand , Scott Ostler 's column , in the same Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Critical Masses , so the adjective for Ostler would have been " **30;146;TOOLONG " ( 30 letters ) . Shall we keep going ? <p> ROD GEDDES <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A MAGIC PLACE <p> Editor  --  I have been noticing comments both for and against your city and I had to put my two cents in . <p> San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities on this globe by right of its architectural growth over the years , setting , ocean , rolling hills , that gorgeous bridge , fog , etc . You will always have people who are dissatisfied with something anywhere there are people . It takes human effort to buy into the beauty of a rose , or the sprawling majesty of a city , and most people are too lazy to bother choosing to see the positive instead of the negative . <p> I have only been fortunate to be able to visit the city twice and both times I was enchanted . By the diversity of people , the skyline , the view and the cable cars . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you find yourselves bitching about the city , go take a purge , vote your mayor out and take a good look around other cities that are just conglomerations of people and buildings with no magic . <p> It 's a shame you do n't know just how much magic surrounds you . <p> KRISTOFER ELROD <p> Camino
