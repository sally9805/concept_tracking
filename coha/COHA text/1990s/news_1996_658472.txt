<p> Thirteen days remain in the major-league baseball season . Teams still shopping for a spot in the playoffs know it 's now or never . A bobbled ball , a wild pitch , or an untimely strikeout can shatter the hopes and dreams accumulated during 5-1/2 months of hard work . <p> At least in one respect , the ' 96 season seems similar to last year 's . The Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians again own the best records in their respective leagues . They could meet again in the World Series , which is set to begin Oct. 18 in the American League city . The home field advantage might be just what Cleveland needs to secure its first title since 1948 . <p> The Braves , despite a late-season slump , are looking to join Toronto as baseball 's only back-to-back winner during the last 18 years . <p> Atlanta still has a crack pitching staff . John Smoltz instead of Greg Maddux is the ace this time . Smoltz has been the best in the National League , ringing up a 21-8 record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand pat , the Braves acquired Denny Neagle , Pittsburgh 's best hurler , in a late-season trade . Ironically , Neagle was winless in his first three starts for Atlanta . <p> The Braves withstood an unusually long midseason road trip , necessitated by the Olympics , which occupied Fulton County Stadium during the Games . The club returned no worse for wear and next year will move into Olympic Stadium , but not until its seating capacity is reduced from 80,000 to 45,000 . <p> Some may have lost track of what was happening in the major leagues , given the Olympics and other summer distractions . The following summary may help to review what has transpired in the first full season since 1993 and how the races shape up : <p> American League races <p> No one has mathematically clinched a division title , but Cleveland and Texas are virtually assured of doing so in the Central and West . Although the Indians are n't likely to notch 100 wins , as they did last year in just 144 games , they clearly possess winning instincts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Confidence is no longer a problem in Cleveland . It could be for wither-prone Texas , though . The Rangers have never reached the postseason in 24 years of trying . However , they entered this week 's four-game season with Seattle , enjoying a comfortable six-game division lead over the Mariners . <p> The Yankees are holding on for dear life to the lead in the remaining division , the East . After once leading by 12 games on July 29 , they 've seen the Baltimore Orioles , who come to the Bronx for a crucial three-game series that begins tonight , almost erase this margin . This has generated sparks between Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and general manager Bob Watson , who has acted as a fire wall between Steinbrenner and field boss Joe Torre . <p> A veteran manager completing his first season in pin stripes , Torre is n't pushing the panic button . To help relax his team after a recent skid , he told his players he did n't want to see them in the clubhouse until right before the next game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who made the All-Star team in only his second season , and has become the club 's first 20-game winner since Ron Guidry in 1985 . <p> The race to decide the AL wild card ( best team among the non-division winners ) appears to be between Baltimore and the Chicago White Sox . Baltimore did as much off-season dealing as any other team to build a contender , yet floundered for a while . Of late , however , they have been one of the hottest teams , getting a lift from the return of designated hitter Eddie Murray , who began his career with Baltimore in 1977 and recently played for Cleveland . Todd Zeile has also had an impact , batting .400 as an Oriole . <p> Baltimore completed its season series with Chicago last week , with the White Sox snapping a five-game Oriole winning streak with a victory in the series finale . Chicago 's Frank Thomas is having another big year at the plate ( .341 batting average , 35 homers through Sunday ) and is joined by Robin Ventura and Harold Baines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineup . <p> National League races <p> Atlanta is the only NL team that appears a lock for a division title , yet even the mighty Braves have looked unusually vulnerable recently . Colorado swept them last week during a three-game series in Denver . Still , Atlanta is not likely to squander a comfortable lead over Montreal in the East . <p> In the Central and West , however , the division races are as tight as a drum . The latter race is liable to be decided in a season-ending freeway series , when the San Diego Padres host the Los Angeles Dodgers for southern California bragging rights and , in all likelihood , the division title . <p> Central rivals St. Louis and Houston are involved in their own down-to-the-wire race , only they have no head-to-head games remaining . St. Louis plays everybody else in the Central during the final two weeks , and given the Cardinals ' 29-11 record against division opponents , the situation looks promising . St. Louis enjoys good balance in its pitching staff , which is led by the Benes brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season wondering where home will be next year . Ownership has threatened to move the club if attendance does n't reach 2 million . There are signs , however , that a new stadium might be built that would keep the team in Houston . <p> If the season had ended Sunday , San Diego would have grabbed the wild-card berth . A lot could happen to change that , however . <p> NOTABLES IN A SEASON OF HOME RUNS <p> This has been the Year of the Home Run in major-league baseball . Long balls have rained into the cheap seats . Playing a full 162-game season for the first time since 1993 , of course , helps boost slugging output . But the real reasons most often cited for the record downpour are poor pitching , smaller ballparks , more muscular hitters , and a suspected livelier ball . Whatever the reasons , there 's no denying the evidence . A sampling follows : <p> * Most overall home runs in a season : Florida 's Gary Sheffield broke the old mark from 1987 , when he hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most home runs by a team : The Baltimore Orioles used five home runs on Sunday to bring their season total to 243 , moving ahead of the 1961 Mantle-Maris Yankees , who belted 240 without benefit of a designated hitter . Baltimore has nine players in uniform who 've collected 20 or more homers , a major-league record . The Oakland A 's are poised to move past the ' 61 Yankees as well . On Saturday Mark McGwire , Oakland 's first baseman , became only the 13th player in major-league history to reach 50 homers , and this while playing in only 119 games . <p> * Numerous individual slugging surges : Players far surpassing their previous best home-runs season include Baltimore 's Brady Anderson ( 46 vs. 21 ) , Colorado 's Ellis Burks ( 38 vs. 21 ) and New York Mets catcher Todd Hundley ( 41 vs. 16 ) . Hundley broke Roy Campenella 's single-season record for catchers on Saturday . <p> * Ruthian effort : If Albert Belle hits 50 homers ( he has 46 ) , the Cleveland outfielder will join Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consecutive seasons . <p> * Leap in tape-measure homers : Hits of 460 feet or longer have nearly doubled during the past year according to a group that charts their distance .
