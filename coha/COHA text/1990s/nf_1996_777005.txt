Preparing for the Expedition // January - June 1803 // A week after Congress appropriated the funds for the expedition , Jefferson began writing his scientific friends . The message was the same in each case : the expedition has been authorized but is still confidential ; I have chosen Captain Lewis to lead it ; Lewis needs advice and instruction . The letters made it clear that Jefferson intended the recipients to provide advice and instruction without cost to the government . // Lewis 's schooling began during the period from New Year 's Day to the Ides of March . Lewis was still living in the President 's House , conferring with Jefferson as often and for as long as Jefferson 's schedule would allow . Beyond the conferences and the practical lessons in the use of the sextant and other measuring instruments , which took place on the lawn , Lewis studied maps in Jefferson 's collection . // He also conferred with Albert Gallatin , a serious map-collector . Gallatin had a special map made up for Lewis showing North America from the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known of the Missouri River up to the Mandan villages in the Great Bend of the river ( today 's Bismarck , North Dakota ) , and a few wild guesses as to what the Rockies might look like and the course of the Columbia . There were but three certain points on the map : the latitude and longitude of the mouth of the Columbia , of St. Louis , and of the Mandan villages ( thanks to British fur traders ) // By the time he finished studying with Jefferson and Gallatin , Lewis knew all that there was to know about the Missouri and what lay to the west of it . // The problem was that west of the Mandans nearly to the coast was terra incognita . And the best scientists in the world could not begin to fill in that map until someone had walked across the land , taking measurements , providing descriptions of the flora , fauna , rivers , mountains , and people , not failing to note the commercial and agricultural possibilities . // To make that journey required a frontiersman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it could do to make the passage easier and more fruitful . That was the positive side of Jefferson 's choice of Lewis , who was in fact the perfect choice . Indeed , Lewis 's career might almost have been dedicated to preparing him for this adventure . He knew the Old Northwest about as well as any man in the country , he knew lonely forest trails through Indian country , he knew hunting and fishing and canoes , he knew how to keep records , had adequate mathematical skills , and for two years had been privy to Mr. jefferson 's hopes and dreams , his curiosity and knowledge . // Jefferson told Patterson that Lewis had the required frontier skills , to which " he joins a great stock of accurate observation on the subjects of the three kingdoms .... He has been for some time qualifying himself for taking observations of longitude &amp; latitude to fix the geographical points of the line he will pass over . " But he needed help , and it was Patterson 's and the other scientists in Philadelphia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course they were all delighted to do so anyway . // It was a favorite saying of one of President jefferson 's twentieth-century successors , Dwight Eisenhower , that in war , before the battle is joined , plans are everything , but once the shooting begins , plans are worthless . The same aphorism can be said about exploration . In battle , what can not be predicted is the enemy 's reaction ; in exploration , what can not be predicted is what is around the next bend in the river or on the other side of the hill . The planning process , therefore , is as much guesswork as it is intelligent forecasting of the physical needs of the expedition . It tends to be frustrating , because the planner carries with him a nagging sense that he is making some simple mistakes that could be easily corrected in the planning stage , but may cause a dead loss when the mistake is discovered midway through the voyage . // For this expedition , planning was going on at two levels . The president was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was becoming a long , complex document , for Jefferson was making a list of the things he wanted to know about the West . Since there was so much he wanted to know , far more than a single expedition could answer , he had to make choices . There was no mention of looking for gold or silver in the draft Jefferson was circulating , for example , whereas soil conditions and climate were included . Trade possibilities were prominent . // Taken all together , the instructions represented a culmination and a triumph of the American Enlightenment . The expedition authorized by the popularly elected Congress would combine scientific , commercial , and agricultural concerns with geographical discovery and nation-building . All the pillars of Enlightenment thought , summed up with the phrase " useful knowledge , " were slithering in the instructions . // While Jefferson worked on the instructions , Lewis had his own planning to do . Jefferson would set the objectives , but it was Captain Lewis who would get the expedition there and back . The responsibility was his for deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Missouri River , what it would need to cross the Rocky Mountains and descend the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean and return . The team would have to do this as a self-contained unit . Once the expedition left St. Louis , Lewis would be stuck with the decisions he had made during the planning process . // How many men ? With what skills ? How big a boat ? What design ? What type of rifle ? How much powder and lead ? How many cooking pots ? What tools ? How much dry or salted rations could be carried ? What medicines , in what quantity ? What scientific instruments ? What books ? How many fishing hooks ? How much salt ? Tobacco ? Whiskey ? // Lewis and Jefferson talked into the late evening about such questions . Jefferson thought it would be a good idea to carry some cast-iron corn mills to give the Indians as presents . Lewis agreed . They discussed the trade beads that were the currency of the western Indian tribes , and agreed that plenty would be needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they concocted the idea of a collapsible iron-frame boat , one that could be carried past the falls of the Missouri , wherever that might be , and put together at the far end with animal skins to cover it , so that the expedition would be back in business on the water . // They talked about timing . Now that the appropriation was in hand , both men wanted to get started as soon as possible . With the coming of spring and the drying of the roads , Lewis wanted to be ready to go . He told Jefferson he hoped to be across the Appalachians by early summer . He intended to go to the post at South West Post , near present Kingston in eastern Tennessee , and there enlist his core group of soldier-explorers from the garrison . He planned to march them overland to Nashville , where he would pick up a previously ordered keelboat to float down the Cumberland River to its junction with the Ohio , not far above the Ohio 's junction with the Mississippi . // He planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to proceed a good bit of the way up the Missouri before being forced into winter camp . In 1804 , he expected to cross the mountains , reach the Pacific , make the return journey , and report back before winter set in. //
