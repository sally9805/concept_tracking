A buddy of mine who fishes during every spare moment between hunting seasons , and who rarely gives a gun a second thought this time of year , mentioned the other day that he would be buying himself a better bird gun next fall . " Those guys I hunt with practice on clay targets all summer , " he said . " But I believe the main reason they 've been beating me to shots is that their guns are lighter and faster than my old clunker . What do you think ? " Having seen him shoot , I agreed that it might not hurt to try something new . But he 'd be much better off if he switched to a different gun now , while there 's still time to get used to it , rather than wait until just before hunting season . That weekend he met me at a Sporting Clays range carrying a beautiful new over/under . But the only thing he could consistently hit with it was his face . He 'd picked a European-made model that normally comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a lefty . This means that the stock was angled far enough into his face to hammer his cheekbone while the load was sent high and off-center to the right . Maybe my friend should have known that the gun did n't fit when he first picked it up in the store . But he 'd always steadfastly refused to listen any time I began discussing what he calls " fancy stuff " about shooting , such as stock dimensions or gun fit . So now he found himself with a gun he could n't shoot , purchased from a store that would n't take it back because it had been fired , and the only good news was that he had n't waited until September to find all that out . As it happened , he was able to swap the gun to a dealer ( who probably was a bit in need of some off-season gun business ) , and wound up with a secondhand , very high quality over/under whose stock was bent for a left-hander . For the first time in his life my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his shooting improved dramatically . There 's a lot to be said for sticking with one gun until it becomes as familiar and comfortable as an old shoe  --  but not if the old shoe did n't fit to start with . And even when a gun seems to fit fairly well , there 's always the chance that you 'll find one which is just a little easier to hit with  --  a bit more " forgiving . " When a shotgun of mine starts missing too often , it 's likely to get punished by having to sit in the closet for a while . In the meantime , I 'll try something else  --  even a friend 's gun or a trade-in that 's sitting on the rack at some shooting range . That 's how I discovered two of the best-shooting guns I 've ever owned , guns I 'd never have known about had I stuck with the one I had at the time . Now is prime time for such shopping . Dealers are more likely to make discounts during the off-season , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is likely , there 's still time to order it and make the necessary adjustments  --  recoil pad , scope , stock fitting , or whatever  --  before the preseason rush . Gunsmiths are less frantically harried by hunters now , so they 're more able to do their best work on meticulous tasks such as tuning triggers . Ranges are n't as crowded as they will be in fall , so it 's a lot less hectic sighting in , selecting loads , and getting accustomed to the gun . Thousands of shooters of woodchucks , coyotes , prairie dogs , and other pesky varmints ( such as clay targets ) are already coming into " new gun heat . " And just thumbing through gun catalogs and magazines can add a little spice to life in spring . But the final decision on a new gun would be a lot easier to make if guns would shoot as well out in the real world as they " feel " when they 're hefted in a store . Selecting a shotgun without shooting it can be a problem because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great extent determine where the gun will shoot . One way to have some idea of point of impact is to shut both eyes and mount the gun as you would to shoot , then open your eyes and observe how much of the barrel is visible above the action . If you can see just the front bead sight and about an inch or so of rib or barrel , odds are the gun will impact fairly close to dead on if you mount it that way when hunting . The more barrel you can see , the higher it will tend to shoot . I 've heard oldtime hunters refer to such guns as having too much " rise " to the barrel , which is just another way of saying the stock does n't have enough " drop " to suit them . There are many little things that can be learned about a gun in a store without shooting it , but few shoppers take advantage of them . A gun with crisp and reasonably light trigger pull weight is likely to be easier for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creepy pull . To check the trigger pull , the store should have " snap caps " ( dummy cartridges designed to protect tiring pins ) . Although snapping a pump or autoloader usually wo n't hurt anything , doubles and over/unders should be snapped only with snap caps or , in a pinch , on an empty cartridge case . Just be sure to ask before you snap someone else 's gun . Gun weight does n't matter much in a store , but it sure does after you 've carried the gun around all day . And balance has a lot to do with the way a gun mounts and swings . Try to shoot a few targets with a gun that 's as similar as possible to the make and model you 're considering buying before you make the decision . If you ca n't find a buddy with such a gun , see if there 's a store ( or more likely a shooting range ) in your area that deals in used guns and will permit test firing . A used gun may be your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make or model for about what a brand-new " ordinary " gun would cost , and the used gun will probably last longer than you will . Guns are not like cars ; they do n't necessarily wear out , and some are designed to " wear in . " A used over/under shotgun , for example , will probably not be as stiff to open and close as when it was new . If it 's a hunting gun , it 's probably nowhere near worn out , even though brush scratches or worn blueing can make it look as if it has a million miles on it . Bag limits and shooting opportunities in this country are no longer liberal enough to " wear out " man guns . You 'll hear sad stories of rifle barrels that have been " shot out , " some of which may be true if the owner has been a varmint hunter or target shooter who fires thousands of rounds a year . But the " shot out " barrels of the deer rifles I 've seen have simply been dirty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer hunter still is n't aware that cleaning a barrel with oil  --  or even ordinary bore solvent  --  just wo n't remove the bullet jacket copper that gradually builds up in the grooves of the rifling and robs accuracy . Gun stores carry the special bore cleaning solvents that do work on copper , and the " shot out " barrel you can buy cheaply may be fairly easily salvaged to shoot well again . Unfortunately , some such barrels ca n't be saved because in the process of being left so dirty over a period of time , condensation has caused rust-pitting . Thus the barrel of a second-hand gun should be carefully checked . One of the best  --  and most overlooked  --  places to shop for shotguns is your local shooting range . You 'll see a lot of guns in use , and can usually pick up valuable tips from range personnel or customers . Many ranges stock used guns and/or have bulletin boards that list used guns for sale by individuals . Tremendous bargains can be found here , but unlike most hunting guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most likely to have suffered serious wear are trap guns , because so much ammo is fired quickly at that game . Next are skeet guns , and then Sporting Clays guns . A sign that an over/under has been shot a lot is that the opening lever moves past center to the left when the action is closed . Such guns should be tightened up , preferably by the manufacturer . Otherwise some models may ultimately begin flying open when fired . I 've never seen anyone hurt by this , but it sure can be disconcerting . One way to diagnose hinge-pin or locking-lug wear in some over/unders is to remove the fore-end , hold the gun by the grip with the barrels pointed upward , and shake it . If you can feel movement , you 'd better find another gun . Ditto if there 's a gap between the barrels and the action face when the gun is closed . Old shotguns are n't likely to have the " choke shot out of " em " as some folks believe , but it 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been opened or otherwise fiddled with . Whenever possible , pattern the gun , if for no other reason than to see whether it shoots straight . Early into the current era of interchangeable choke tubes , some major gun manufacturers turned out barrels that did n't shoot straight because the choke system was n't put in quite straight . I 've also seen guns with improperly installed muzzle devices such as Cutts Compensators , Polychoke , etc. that shot several feet off-center at 40 yards . Even if you 're buying a new gun , there 's more to the process than just heading for the discount store with the cheapest prices . There is , for example , " dirty shopping " in which you first go to a good gunshop where he clerks know about guns and wo n't route you to the plumbing department if you ask to see a pump , then head for the discount store to make your purchase . Of course , this is n't a foolproof shopping tactic . The discount store model could turn out to be a cheaper version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or something might turn out to be wrong with the gun , and the discount-sore clerk may not even know what you 're talking about . A somewhat mechanically challenged friend of mine once purchased an autoloader that  --  unnoticed by him or the discount-store clerk  --  had its magazine cutoff lever turned to the position which prohibits cartridge feeding . The poor guy spent opening weekend of dove season cursing his " jamming " autoloader that would fire only one shot . When he took it back to the store , the clerk looked at the gun somewhat blankly and said it would have to be sent back to the factory for repair . Fortunately , my friend happened to mention the autoloader 's " symptoms " to me , and I told him to get his gun back and simply flip that little lever on the side  --  which any good gun store clerk would probably have told him to start with . One of the sad facts of modern retailing is that mass merchandising outlets are crowding out small gun shops where clerks know guns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big national firms that specialize in used guns , and some will ship " em out on approval . Members of competitive shooting organizations usually get organizational magazines that carry advertisements from such dealers , and the ads include gun lists and prices . You may know a shooter who gets such magazines , or you might want to try a shooting range , where the manager will probably have back copies or the phone numbers of such organizations . Some dealers regularly send out gun lists and prices to customers . Another potential source is the classified advertising section of your newspaper . Every blue moon or so , some real bargains will appear . It takes time to run down those leads , and a lot of the guns will be junkers , but one fellow I know lucked into a near-mint Parker that a widow had advertised as " an old double-barreled shotgun . " Have you ever gone to one of those " gun and knife " shows you see advertised occasionally ? Better yet , do you know someone who goes regularly , or even offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale or trade ? If this person is trustworthy , give him money to buy the model you 're interested in should he come across one at a show . Or better yet , go with him when he 's shopping a big show ( where you 'll see an incredible selection of used guns ) and let him do the bargaining . Veteran gun traders can recognize each other almost as quickly as they can spot a novice gun shopper . Ask your gunsmith for any advice he can give you on how to check the condition of a gun , and ask him about any particular parts you should check that might reveal signs of wear or previous abuse . He knows about such things from fixing what breaks . You may not even need another gun . In the years I traveled the pigeon circuits , there was an old saying among money hustlers : " Beware of the man with one gun and a lot of choke . " The truth was , however , that the very shooters who repeated that advice  --  as is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had to buy and swap their way through several guns before they found that " one gun " worth sticking with . Hence another old adage : " Engage brain before activating charge card . " <p>
