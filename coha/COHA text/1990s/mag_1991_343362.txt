OBJECT LESSONS by Anna Quindlen ; Random House ; 272 pages ; $19 <P> What ever happened to the family novel , that sturdy fictional genre that tracked unfolding generations , changing times , hovering fates ? Mostly it went commercial , with volumes  --  the fatter the better  --  designed to be hauled up the best-seller lists . So it is encouraging when a fresh and talented writer takes the category seriously . Anna Quindlen clearly believes in writing what you know . For most of the past decade she has chronicled her husband , their kids , her mother and grandmother in her New York Times columns . Three years ago , many of her pieces were collected in a book , accurately titled Living Out Loud . She tackles serious social issues , but her takeoff point is usually the kitchen . <P> Set in the 1960s , Object Lessons concerns three generations of a rich Irish clan who live in an established inner suburb of New York City . The patriarch , John Scanlan , is a lively if familiar fictional figure , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who now has vestment factories in Manila and construction companies closer to home . The Scanlans ' milieu has much in common with the author 's childhood as depicted in her columns : nuns , summers at the beach and minute , competitive skirmishes among preadolescent girls . Quindlen also relishes skewering pirates like John ; to him the Kennedys are merely " second-rate Scanlans with too much hair . " <P> It follows that all his children are in some way weak or stunted . One of them , Tom  --  in Pop 's cement business  --  rebels by marrying a handsome , lower- class Italian girl . It is their daughter Maggie who is trying desperately to master some object lessons during her 12-year-old summer . Though she is much brighter than friends and cousins ; they are maturing faster than she ; her pregnant mother dallies with an old friend ; her grandfather orders her parents to move into a bigger house he has acquired for them and then has a serious stroke . <P> Quindlen is at her best writing about the dislocations of growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie 's best friend , Debbie Malone , suddenly takes up with a precocious tramp named Bridget Hearn . " There are things that I 'm interested in now that you 're not that interested in , " announces Debbie . " Maybe we 're maturing at different rates . " Maggie 's pretty cousin Monica , a few years older , " has to marry " that summer and seethes with resentment at Maggie 's brains and freedom . " You 're worse than everyone else because you pretend to be so good , " she explodes . <P> Unfortunately , she may have a point . The vacationing youngsters here are all vividly real  --  except for rather smug Maggie , who is the pivot . Her retorts run along the lines of " What is it like to be like you ? " to the bitchy Monica . When downcast , Maggie does not lash out but retreats to her room , where yet another chapter ends with quiet tears or staring at the ceiling . She is someone waiting to be  --  a writer is hinted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meticulousness : the smart energy of her journalist 's voice is missing . But surely she knows that good novels have been written at kitchen tables too .
