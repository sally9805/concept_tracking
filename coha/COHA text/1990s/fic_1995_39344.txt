Last year there was no summer at all in the ghetto . Soon after Pesach an ice cold wind suddenly started blowing again . Sterile clouds floating by left a trace of sickly pallor in the hollow sky . Winter refused to loose its grip , and ever since Hanukkah a gray mist of evaporating snow remained suspended over the rooftops . People thought that as soon as the sun grew stronger the mist would disappear and the blue sky would emerge . But well into summer the sky was still not to be seen . At the crack of dawn , when the sun was just coming over the horizon , then just barely , perhaps for a split second , it might be possible to catch a hint of a shred of blue sky . But in an instant the shred of blue would dissolve in a blast of demonic wind bringing down a curtain of soot . The diabolically frigid wind blew freely through the window frames and attic openings . Jews who had discarded their heavy winter clothes now retrieved them from their bench-chests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling . The sun did not show itself in this ghetto for whole days at a time . Only a bleak darkness sifted through to the streets . Each day the twilight grew denser . Once in a while a yellowish spot with vivid reddish edges , resembling an enormous brass coin , would break through the clouds , then slowly slide into obscurity , as if in an eclipse . <p> A feeling of terror settled down on the Jews who remained in the little street , but the terror was accompanied by a desperate hope that ultimately they would be comforted . Reading some of the ancient mystical texts that had been preserved , someone had ascertained that in this very year there would be a great upheaval and disruption among the angels that would lead to the dissolution of the world . All this was to happen at a time when the Jews were going through great troubles and persecution . By means of certain allusions and numerological speculations it was discovered that this fated year would begin with the disappearance of summer . First there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear only fitfully before being extinguished altogether . It would hang like a feeble lamp in a void among the desolate angels . Birds in midflight would descend to earth like falling stones . <p> There was a second sect of Jews on the same street who said just the opposite : The sun would indeed no longer be seen , and would appear to be extinguished . But by manipulating certain texts and interpreting various biblical sayings , the sages of this sect demonstrated that these signs would only be an indication that the world was on the verge of the great moment of destruction when there would be days with no light . The sun would appear to be dead . The stars would disappear from the firmament . Powerful blizzards accompanied by thunder and lightning would break out . But all these happenings would be signs of a new beginning ... And all these things would surely come to pass at a time when Jews are in deepest distress . And in the year of greatest Jewish suffering , a dazzling light would appear in the east with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flame which would eliminate all evil from the world , uprooting Satan and all the slaughterers of the Jewish people . The seeming destruction would actually be the moment of illumination and redemption .... <p> In the peculiar weather of that summer , women and elderly Jews of the little ghetto actually saw all manner of signs that had already been set forth in the sacred books . The decrees of the Germans had plunged the Jews into their moment of deepest darkness . Everywhere one looked , abandoned courtyards were laid waste and resembled houses for purifying the dead . Naked corpses lay rotting and unattended in the open air , and no one came to pick them up . Dead people sat at tables , leaning on their elbows , as if they were in a trance . Near their gray lifeless heads lay dried-up potato peels . <p> At the first sign of sunset the few Jews left on the street used to steal into the Sampolne Rebbe 's room to recite evening prayers in secret . In a double wall in his apartment , the Sampolne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue velvet mantle studded with a variety of glowing stones . Nobody knew where the old man had obtained the miniature Torah . People whispered that all the auguries and prophecies were coming from the old man himself , from the Sampolne Rebbe . At every prayer session he preached good tidings to the Jews , reading prophecies of redemption out of the sacred texts . <p> The Rebbe of Sampolne was sitting alone in his room , bent over a crumbling , dusty book . There was nothing in the room but a bucket of water and , in a corner , a bench with three legs . The fourth foot was a stack of red bricks . A fat old cat that had been following the Rebbe around for the last few months was seated on the windowsill . At night the cat , lying next to his skinny feet , would even share the Rebbe 's dreams . The whole thing was bizarre , since there were no cats at all in the ghetto , and yet this cat had waxed fat and flourished with the Sampolne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sack for his prayer shawl open at his side . He used to rouse himself suddenly out of his sleep , throw the prayer shawl over his shoulders , and suddenly start raising a racket . He roared , shouted , and stamped his feet on the floor . Neighbors would wake from their sleep , thinking the Germans were dragging Jews out into the courtyard again . But the Rebbe did not shout long , because his strength would fail him and his weak heart could n't stand the strain . He would start to cry and would collapse like a weak newborn lamb . The cat would remain wrapped around his feet wailing like a child . The Sampolne Rebbe would stand next to the window , supporting himself with both hands on the window frame , and look at the stars . Then he would roll up the window and stretch out both his long yellow waxen arms , which resembled no Day-of-Atonement candles . <p> " Gevald , sweet Father ! ... How Long ? How long I ask you ! ... How long must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercy Gevald , sweet Father ! Gevald ! " <p> For a long time he stood there at the window , wrapped in his prayer shawl , and shouted through the courtyard to the stars . <p> Long before the war had started , Jews had considered the Sampolne Rebbe something of a scatterbrain . When someone used to visit him he would first start shaking the visitor and would then honor him with a few fiery slaps . After a while he would take a peasant fiddle with three strings out of the closet and play a lovely melody . As he played , the Sampolne Rebbe kept yelling : <p> " Jackass ! ... Peasant dunce ! ... Do you not hear the melody of the Messiah descended from David ? " <p> Then a little later he would throw the visitor out of the house . <p> The more the Sampolne Rebbe punched people and chased them from his presence , the more the Jews flocked to him , if only to hear his fiddling . There were some who claimed that after they heard his fiddle-playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner being . But most of the Jews would have none of it . They concluded that the Sampolne Rebbe was simply a madman . Or else they suspected him of being involved in some sort of black magic . <p> As the yellowish twilight of the ghetto grew denser , the Sampolne Rebbe gave orders to pack up what Little remained of Jewish artifacts , make small bundles , and prepare for great happenings . Jews said that at night they clearly saw in the dark sky how the great stars in the west were extinguished one at a time and then disintegrated . They fell in tiny fragments over the abyss where the ghetto was located . <p> The thirteenth day of the month of Sivan began in denser darkness than any of the preceding days of the month . The paltry light of dawn quickly melted , and at high noon deepest night returned . A persistent darkness shuffled into the remotest corners of the ghetto . The sun never rose . All the Jews of the street ran through the backyards to the Sampolne Rebbe . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the Rebbe 's room filled with people , and the Rebbe himself pacing the room in his high white stockings , they fell mute . The crowd that had gathered in the little room was in a state of high excitement . Recognizing the truth in all of his prognostications , the Jews now gathered around the Sampolne Rebbe and looked submissively into his distorted pale face , which was flushed with the flame of an inner unearthly ecstasy . Under his torn smock , the trousers kept falling down over his white socks . As he bent over to lift his trousers , he got stuck , and remained stooped over for a long time , as if crying into his lap . At the same time , the yellow star on his shoulder started owing with a beautiful golden radiance . The room was so dark now that the people inside could n't see each other 's faces . Children in their mothers ' arms started crying and whining , " Mama . " The people in the room were so tightly squeezed together they had to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disheveled witch . The Sampolne Rebbe tossed the prayer shawl over his shoulders , and lifting a Torah above the heads of the people shouted in a hoarse voice : " Jews , be prepared ! Let us go , let us all go ! ... Brace yourselves , Jews ! ... We are leaving right now ... Let us all leave together ! ... Follow me , Jews ! " <p> He was the first one out . The rest of the crowd walked behind him under the lightless sky , treading on the stones in fearful silence . Not a pinpoint of sun came from above . They formed a long line because the street was a narrow one that ended in a high dark wall . The Sampolne Rebbe stayed in the lead , carrying the miniature Torah . The crowd , following him through a narrow door , was now walking on soft earth . Nobody knew why they suddenly stopped on the barren ground that led to the cemetery . They realized where they were when women falling in their flight found themselves holding onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from Sampolne and began shouting : " Sampolne Rebbe ! ... Where are you taking us ? Sampolne Rebbe ! ... Turn back , do n't go there ... That 's where the barbed wire is ! ... Sampolne Rebbe ! ... Sampolne Rebbe ! ... " <p> But the Sampolne Rebbe no longer heard anything the women shouted to him . He just kept walking with the Torah enfolded in his arms , and began singing a melody in muffled tones . It was an old traditional melody  --  and several Jews started singing along with him in the darkness . All of a sudden a cold , frosty wind started blowing . Snow even started to fall . Tiny flakes studded the Jews ' heads , like a sprinkling of silver coins . A bolt of green light cut through the darkness of the fenced-in field . The Jews walked in narrow paths among the ancient Jewish tombstones . The snowstorm and the lightning were the last of the signs contained in the sacred texts . By this time the Sampolne Rebbe was carrying a child in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dancing , while shouting to those behind him : <p> " Jews , do n't be frightened ! ... Just look around you  --  all fences are falling ! ... All boundaries are disappearing ! ... With determination , Jews , we are getting out ! ... Out ! ... Out ! ... Look , there are no more fences ! ... Jews , sing all praise to the Creator of the Universe ! " <p> And , indeed , the Sampolne Rebbe was the first to set foot on the little patch of ground near the old fallen gravestones . But he suddenly slipped , and as he was falling banged his head on one of the stones . He immediately regained his feet and kept on going . Another bolt of lightning lit up the burial mounds . Green streaks snaked out of the darkness . The snow flurry swirled around them . Now the Sampolne Rebbe could see distinctly the shadows rising from death mounds  --  men , women , and children , some still in their loose-fitting death shrouds and others completely naked . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky behind the throng . They kept moving forward , faster , drenched in a shimmering green light . <p>
