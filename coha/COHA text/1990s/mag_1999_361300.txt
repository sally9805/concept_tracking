It 's late 1998  --  long before the phrase Columbine school shooting enters your lexicon  --  and you 're a researcher at a hate-group-monitoring center . Your job is to trawl the Web , surf literally thousands of " anarchy " links and make a note of the really nasty ones . One day you stumble across a high school student 's website that contains a lot of hateful teen posturing and some plug-ins for a best-selling violent computer game . Do you bookmark it ? <P> The answer is no  --  at least , not for researchers at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , who came across Eric Harris ' home page on America Online some six months ago but did n't include it on their CD-ROM directory of hate sites . " It did n't have explicit threats against any individual or institution , " explains the center 's associate dean , Rabbi Abraham Cooper . " We see very , very ominous websites regularly  --  by the hundreds . " <P> AOL yanked Harris ' site within hours of last week 's shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies were already circulating across cyberspace  --  along with a few sick hoaxes  --  and their contents made many folks eager to blame the Internet for this tragedy . Others pointed to violent video games , particularly Doom and Quake , Harris ' favorites . In these seminal works , players wander through claustrophobic corridors in a terrifyingly real first-person perspective , blasting the guts out of their enemies with a blistering array of weaponry . " You can actually set the gore level on some of these games , " notes Jeff Inman , a specialist in youth intervention in Cobb County , Ga . " How much blood do you want to see splattered ? It 's sickening . It gives kids a lack of respect for life . " <P> Even more ominous is when the games go beyond serving up generic gore and start trafficking in fantasies of bias crimes . There are video games out there that make Doom look like an art-house flick . For example , white supremacists can stage virtual lynchings with a game called Hang Leroy , clandestinely available on Klan sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug-in that changes the color of the victims . " Hate is available in many flavors on the Internet , " says Raymond Franklin , a Maryland police executive and publisher of the Hate Directory . He says that neo-Nazis could take advantage of what was until recently a largely young white male audience online  --  a fertile recruiting ground . Rabbi Cooper too is worried about such groups ' having " unassailable full-time access to America 's young people in the most powerful cultural medium ever created . " <P> And yet there is no way of calculating how much of a role was played by propaganda and video games in Harris and Dylan Klebold 's killing spree . Quake and its ilk may have helped desensitize a generation  --  but you 're blasting cyborgs , not classmates , and you 're certainly not constructing pipe bombs . Harris ' online essay on how to make these devices suggests that he made most of his discoveries through trial and error , not on the Net . The computer age may be giving kids a new outlet for their dark fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers . <P>  --  By Chris Taylor .
