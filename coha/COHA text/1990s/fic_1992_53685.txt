THE BIG NEWS in my neighborhood is that Tom and Sue are going to be on " The Newlywed Game " or rather , " The New Newlywed Game , " as Sue has corrected me over the past four months . It all started as a joke , a joke which , I might add , stems from my own little anecdote about what I had heard a woman answer one night while I was scanning my cable for something to watch . Bob Eubanks asked , " What vowel does your husband most resemble while asleep ? " and the woman said , " S. " Bob Eubanks said , " Oh , the vowel S , " and the woman nodded . The next woman said a " T , " not a little " t " but a capital " T " because her husband scrunched his shoulders up such that his arms were even with his head . Bob said , " Oh yes , the vowel T , " and once again got an emphatic nod . <p> We were all sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Crawford , who has often been told that he bears a striking resemblance to Pat Sajak , and who had had too many drinks , laughed so hard that he fell into the pool  --  which prompted other people to . follow . That 's how it is here in Windhaven Estates ; we all do the same things . Like if one person hangs out a flag just for the hell of it on some nondescript day , then by noon , all the flags are flying . I 'm starting to get the hang of it all now , though it has n't been easy . Sue and I have been friends for years , one of those odd friendships where you have absolutely nothing in common and yet , for whatever reason , genuinely care about one another . We could not be more different , which is why I never would have imagined that I would one day begin imitating her life . <p> When we were in college , roommates by lottery , Sue was Halloween Queen and I was the editor of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lot better than it sounds . It was a big deal if you were into the Greek fraternity/sorority life ; Sue 's picture was plastered all over campus on a ballot with lots of other beauty queens and every guy in every fraternity voted . She sat on the back of a convertible and rode down Main Street , smiling and waving and yelling , " Go Greek ! " while guys whistled and made cat calls . She wanted me to write an article about her and put her picture on the front of " Ox " , but I saw this story as a conflict of interests . Sue was the perfect example of what my newspaper was trying to destroy ; she was coy and superficial and wore makeup every day of the week . <p> " Did you see me in the parade ? " Sue asked as soon as she got back to our dorm room . She was standing there with an open bottle of champagne in one hand and a long-stemmed red rose in the other . It never occurred to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was typing full blast . " Norlina ? Yoo-hoo ! Are you there ? " She was using that little singsong voice of hers that seemed to charm every man on the face of the earth and just made me want to get sick . She hiked up her sequined evening dress and sat Indian style on her bed . <p> " No , " I said and cut off my typewriter to emphasize that she had interrupted me . " I had too much work to do to go and stand on a comer and watch a parade . " <p> " Well , pardon my ass . " Sue traced her finger around the edge of her Love Story poster where All MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal sat staring into our dorm room . " No , no . Let me take that back , " she giggled and pulled her thick blond hair up on her head , then pointed to the little quote at the bottom of the poster . " Love means never having to say you 're sorry . " <p> " Sue , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't difficult in those days given those thick ugly glasses I used to wear . " I am writing an article about how women need to be appreciated for more than their physical appearance . " As soon as I heard myself say this I wished I had n't . Sue had been trying to get me into contact lenses for over a year , and even with her head reeling from too much champagne , she took in my appearance fro.m head to toe and burst out laughing . <p> " I 'm not laughing at you , Norlina , " she said , but then she did n't say anything else either , just told me to make sure she was up in an hour to get ready for her date , and then drifted off into a snoreless beautiful oblivion that I supposed came with having nothing else on your mind . It did , every now and then , enter my mind that I might be a touch bitter , seeing as how I had had one date my entire life , a blind date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay phone and came back to say that his grandfather just died and he had to . go to Kansas . <p> " Kansas ? " Sue asked when I returned early and interrupted the candlelight dinner she was serving on top of my desk to one of her many admirers , a little jar of red caviar opened and spilling on the only copy of my latest editorial . " He 's not from Kansas . " <p> " No , " her date said . " And his grandfather died last year . " <p> " Oh , " I said . As liberated and open-minded and realistic as you may be , there are those times when the sting of humiliation is unavoidable . And I felt it right then . I said something like , oh screw him , what a doofus he was anyway , and I gathered up my work that had little red eggs clinging to it and went off to a place where I often worked at night , the hall bathroom . It was not a bad place to work : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights were really bright ; if you got thirsty or wanted to wash your face , there were fifteen sinks and fifteen mirrors . Whenever I was upset , I liked to write letters to Marabelle Morgan and tell her how she was about as far from being a Total Woman as Clint Eastwood . How can you be total without a brain , just tell me that ? How can you stand to look at yourself in the mirror ? I was having trouble concentrating and so I went to look in the mirror at myself . I was about to splash my face ( an easy thing to do if you do n't wear makeup ) , and just as I was leaning down caught a glimpse of Sue there in the doorway . She had a caviar cracker in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other . <p> " Norlina , Norlina , Norlina , " she said and came and draped her arm around my neck , caviar cracker swinging near my eye . " It 's not the end of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood up straight and stared at her . I was still in date attire , denim skirt and this prissy monogrammed T-shirt that Sue had given me for my birthday and insisted that I wear . I was wearing her lime-green espadrilles which matched the T-shirt . If I had let Sue , she would have had a big grosgrain bow in my hair ; if I had listened to Sue , my hair would have been streaked ( it 's such a drab color , Norlina ) and permed ( it 's lifeless and limp and too long and you have split ends ) . <p> " You do n't have to say anything , Norlina , " Sue said and pressed her perfect little pink face next to mine . We looked like the before and after of a Glamour magazine makeover . " When you start writing to Marabelle , I know what 's up . " She pointed to my legal pad in the corner where I had written " Marabelle Morgan sucks eggs " and shook her head . " C'm on . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand , and insisted that I turn it up . She did n't insist I drain it , but I did ; I figured what the hell . " It 's not the end of the world . " <p> " Why do you keep saying that ? " I squinted to get her in focus while I cleaned my glasses . " And where 's the date ? " <p> " I sent him on his way . " Sue giggled and stuffed that cracker in her mouth . " I told him that you needed me more than he did . " <p> " Gee , thanks , " I said . " That was real smart . " I imagined the guy now , back in some fraternity basement where the walls and windows were painted black . He 'd be wondering why his date was cut short . And answering himself , Well because Sue 's poor pitiful ugly roommate got dumped by a guy who could n't get dates either . <p> To be dumped is one thing ; getting dumped by someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I am smart , Norlina , " Sue said as we moved down the long hall of the dormitory . " I am very very smart in many many ways . " Whenever Sue drank , she started repeating herself . " You are prejudiced . " <p> " Me ? " I asked her . " I 'm prejudiced ? " <p> " About people like me and Marabelle , " she said . " You are prejudiced against women who have a lot of sex . " <p> " Yeah , right , " I said , feeling mad because she was right , mad because my bed was all . rumpled up where they had been making out while Sue 's bed looked like a picture out of some house decorating book . <p> " What you need to know , Norlina , " Sue said when the light was off and I was just about asleep , " is if you 've got butter in your refrigerator , your man wo n't have to go getting some margarine on the street . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What man ? " <p> Occasionally Sue has been right , and usually when I least expected it . I mean who would have ever thought she was right when she suggested that I move into this neighborhood ? It 's taking time to be sure , but I am adjusting . My first month here I bought a color TV , VCR , cable hookup , and a microwave . Money was no problem since I had saved a bundle living with Byron for those seven long years . Down with Materialism and Up with Nature . That was Byron 's motto . He was a selfappointed forest ranger and we lived in a pup tent in a national park . I had a job as the person who checks in campers and did get paid on a regular basis though Byron did n't know it . He 'd be off all day communing with nature and smoking dope . He 'd say , " What did you do today , Norlina ? " We 'd be sitting there by the campfire , his pupils the size of frisbees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up after careless campers and had found some money and walked down to the Thriftway Grocery and bought the beans we were eating ( I never told him they were originally pork and beans and I 'd taken that scrap of meat and immediately eaten it ) . Now I 'm hooked on Lean Cuisines and Le Menus and I love every morsel . Now I take a shower daily and I sell real estate and I only think of Byron when the crowd grills out at the Windhaven Estates Clubhouse . <p> " Where have you been , Norlina , that you do n't even know how to work a microwave or a VCR ? " Sue had asked me laughing . For years , even though I stayed in touch with a postcard from time to time , somehow I had always avoided really telling Sue about my life with Byron , which I came to see later was in and of itself a sign that I was in the wrong place . I had missed Sue 's wedding on account of Byron arranging for us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Norlina , " he had said . " Ignorant visitors who feed them could get in big trouble . " On Sue 's wedding day I was way up in a cedar tree waiting for somebody ( like a real park ranger ) to come and get us down and away from this particular spot where it seemed all the bears were hanging out . <p> Sue had not changed a bit and I gave into her just as if we were still back there in the dormitory bathroom . First thing , I let her streak my hair with Clairol hair color and I let her make up . my face and pick out some new clothes . I told my story , bending the truth a slight bit here and there to save her the discomfort of a shock ( I had outright lied to my mother , who thought I 'd married an Egyptian archaeologist and returned with him to study the Great Pyramids ) . <p> I told Sue that I had married Byron ( she 'd met him in college ) and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagant living . I did not let on , of course , that Byron was the one who married us because he believed there was no position that could not be selfappointed , or that we took vows to love and lust one another and never waste water or eat meat there near Buzzard 's Gap . <p> " I really do n't know why I married him , " I told Sue who was pulling my hair through little holes in a rubber cap with a crochet hook . ( It hurts like hell to get your hair streaked , but I 'm a true stoic , as hard and unbreakable as the piece of petrified wood that Byron gave me as a token of our union . " We will now exchange natural artifacts , " he had said during our vows and pressed that wood into my palm . I gave him what he thought was an arrowhead but was really a man-made piece of costume jewelry I found in front of the freezer in Thriftway . I think it had been an earring before it got stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know why I married Byron , but really I do . Byron is the only man who ever showed any interest in me , plain and simple . He walked up to me one clear blue day and asked me to sign a petition that said I wanted to boycott all restaurants that served meat . He stood there looking at me , ready to engage me in conversation just as soon as he had my signature . How could I resist that ? Sometimes back then I 'd measure time by how long I 'd gone without another human speaking to me ( except Sue , of course , who had no choice but to talk to me since we lived together ) . It was like I was invisible , the way that I could go for days without a human voice speaking directly to me as an individual . The longest I ever went was five days . That record was broken by somebody who knocked on my dorm door and said , " Do you have any liquor can buy from you ? " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking while that tall thin guy stood there waiting . I wanted him to talk but all he said was , " Well , do you or do n't you ? " and when I shook my head , he turned and walked down to the next door . I heard the girl there ( a friend of Sue 's ) say , " Why no , I do n't care much for liquor myself unless of course I 'm having a strawberry daiquiri . I really like the ones they make down at Barry 's Bar , you know the place with the cover charge ? " And he said , " Well , what are we waiting for ? " <p> You can imagine , then , how good it made me feel to look up and have Byron standing right there in front of me and looking me right square  --  through the glasses  --  in the eye . Sure , I thought he looked a little strange with a big brand drawn on his bare back ( red and black so it looked hot ) , fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and two bricks tied to a rope and swinging from his waist right in front of the groin area ( castration is unnaturaly ) , but it had been so long since I 'd really communicated with anyone . The readership of my paper had gotten so small I had had to fold , and I had been replaced by a magazine that kept the paper 's name ( adding the male genetic symbol ) . It was a billboard for personal ads , most of them with peculiar requests . " I ca n't believe your magazine " Sue had said . " I mean you go along with that stuff ? All these variations on the theme of love ? " No matter how many times I told her that it was not my magazine anymore , she kept talking like it was . And she read that rag more than she had ever read anything in her life . " I do n't get this at all , " she must have said a thousand times a day . It was a dark dark time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited up for protest and holding out a ballpoint pen . I was the first person to sign , the first person he 'd approached ; he asked me to go sit with him in front of Burger King and ask customers how they would like to be hit in the head with a club , bled and carved , ground and charcoal-broiled ? One man said , " That 's disgusting ! " Byron just stared at the man in what I later came to think of as his slack ' jawed way . It seemed his mouth was always sort of hanging open in a stupid gape and I should 've taken note of that , should 've known that it would eventually get to me . <p> I mean all the signs were there ; all the reasons why I should n't go live a self-appointed life in the woods with Byron , but I was desperate just to have a life . But still , with every little perfumed card I got from Sue , ( I kept a post office box that I went to once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thriftway Grocery ( four miles down and four miles up ) , I started imagining myself in Sue 's world , the thick rugs and carpet , the waterbeds and televisions and chlorinated pools . I imagined myself in a hot bubble bath and climbing between clean sheets and under a perfumed comforter and the air conditioner churning out all that manufactured coolness . The thoughts were certainly better than my reality : Byron hosing me down like a forest fire and then zipping me into that double sleeping bag that had God only knows what living down in the foot of it . <p> " What a cop out , " Byron said the day I packed my backpack and headed down the trail . I ca n't tell you how pitiful he looked there in his torn faded jeans , his ribs showing like xylophone keys through that grungy white skin , those thin strands of cotton-candy hair pulled back and tied with that stringy old bandanna . It makes me itch to think of him and then it makes me laugh . It makes me laugh all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Menu , sweet and sour chicken , and watch its seven-minute spin . <p> I laugh all the way over to my sectional sofa from which I flip on my widescreen TV by remote . Any minute now and Tom and Sue will be on that screen right before my very eyes . Jack Crawford ( who does look a little like Pat Sajak would if he had no hair and thirty extra pounds ) is coming over to watch with me . He 's no dream man but it 's a lot better than being with Byron , and unlike Byron who used to periodically take a vow of silence out of respect for the trees , Jack Crawford never shuts up . If I say the weather is nice , then Jack feels compelled to tell me why , ( low humidity , the time of year , my house faces north , blah blah ) ; if I say I do n't care for black olives , he tells me why . <p> " You ought to be on ' Jeopardy , ' " I said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know more than God . " He smiled and thanked me while everybody got a good laugh , the intended sarcasm in my voice floating up and beyond all the strings of white mini-lights in the trees . So I thought , Why not relax and give these people a chance . Why not overlook the fact that these people are n't the smartest on the planet ( and Byron was ? ) . They do have good taste in belongings . I made a decision to work on my life , to try and fit in with these people . I mean , they are certainly more normal than Byron , and most importantly , they accept me as one of them . <p> I remember staring up at those little mini-lights ( they would have sent Byron into a seizure ) and thinking about it all . I remember thinking could overlook the fact that Jack Crawford wore platform shoes and had bad breath . ( I mean , look at what I 'd already lived through . ) I could overlook that Sue 's perfect man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them used twice and strung together to make statements like , " Oh Sue-Sue , you little cute-cute . " He was just as good-looking as she had always said and he did have an absolutely perfect body , so okay , give the man that . I decided right then and there to give this life the benefit of the doubt . After all , had n't Sue gone out of her own little way to be there for me ? <p> " Speaking of game shows , " I had said and leaned forward , " the other night I was watching ' The Newlywed Game . ' " <p> " The New Newlywed Game , ' " Sue said and nodded to Tom who was pinching up her little-little cheek to kiss her cute-cute self . <p> " Anyway , they asked this woman which vowel her husband most resembled while he slept .... " I continued my story , Jack Crawford staring a hole through my breasts . I was about to move quickly to startle him , to say something like fill your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go . It had been a long time since anybody had looked at me . Next thing I knew , Jack sprang up like a jack-in-the-box and leapt into the pool fully clothed . Before too long we all followed . <p> " Let me explain to you why you want me , " Jack said later when the two of us were stretched out on my waterbed , his weight causing my side to buoy a good six inches higher than his . <p> " Do you have to ? " I asked , and he said it was just what he was hoping , a woman who was all action and no talk ; he 'd read about such and whenever I was ready he could expound on the subject . He had heard that women like me , homely in the youthful years , sometimes suddenly blossomed like one of Georgia O'Keeffe 's sensuously sexy flowers and would I like to hear what he knows about her or would I rather just go right ahead and do my thing ? <p> Talk about a rock and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd had there in the pup tent with Byron . It 's sad sometimes how life is distorted by comparisons ; good  --  better  --  best , when really you were never up to good at all . I just lay there and indulged my best fantasy to date while Jack Crawford began going into what he called his " sexual trance , " which resembled some kind of dance like you might expect to see from a tribe of pygmies . My fantasy of the moment was this : I have married a handsome Indian doctor and live with him in Bombay where he is a highly specialized surgeon revered by all . I wear saris and sandals and a veil over my face in public , but just let us get home and we go wild for each other , a trail of clothes strewn over my gleaming tile floors and expensive carpets . My liberal-minded sensitive surgeon sings and laughs the whole time he prepares dinner while I put on the Rolling Stones and dance around in my underwear . We are incognito ; we fit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat lots of puff bread and curried rice and pork vindaloo ; we eat crepe suzettes and pasta primavera and Hostess Twinkies . This was the fantasy and I closed my eyes tightly and brought to my mind sitar music , high twings and twangs , while Jack Crawford explained his rapid heartbeat and profuse sweating . It was quite a feat , but I could still maintain that life could be worse . <p> I have just finished my dinner when the doorbell rings and in strolls Jack with a box of Ritz crackers and a jar of peanut butter and an explanation about how he has found these foods to be aphrodisiacs for all the men in his family . " Oh , " I say and tell him to . sit down . The show is coming on right this second . Same music , same Bob Eubanks , and there they are : Sue and Tom , all the way from Windhaven Estates . <p> " Everybody 's watching , " Jack whispers and reaches for my hand . Cracker crumbs are sticking to his damp palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every home . You know how there 's a bluish-grayish glow in the window when a set is on . You know how it 's like you 're sitting in a room and turn a set off ... ? " I have to blank my brain and comparison shop : Byron ( scratching his head to see if anything has set up housekeeping there ) , then back to Jack . I can face him more easily now . Now I can also face Tom and Sue who are doing real well . Sue has answered all of her questions correctly : his favorite fast-food restaurant is Snoopy 's Sushi ; his former girlfriend 's name is Trix ; and he was most embarrassed the time she walked in and saw him trying on her underwear . " Yeah , I remember when that happened ! " Jack says and kisses a mouthful of crumbs onto my cheek . " Yeah , that was when I was still with my ex and we all got such a kick out of Sue 's story that we all started wearing the spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jack Crawford , fully expecting to see the slackest jaw of them all , a jaw so slack that it just swings back and forth like it 's held by rubber bands , but no sir , not Jack 's jaw ; it is moving up and down in tight mechanical bites , crackers spewing . All I can think about is Jaws and that multimillion-dollar machine they made to jump up and eat the boat and most of its inhabitants at the end . <p> Each time Tom has said , " Goody goody Sue-Sue , " and now there 's a commercial break and now Sue is left to say what Tom will answer . Bob Eubanks is chuckling when they come back on . Sue obviously has said something real cute-cute . <p> " Who will your husband say is your strangest friend ? " Bob asks and goes down the line . I think Sue should say Karma ( she renamed herself ) , who heads up the Weico.me Wagon and has recently had both a breast enlargement and a fanny tuck . Jack thinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little strange , you must admit , " he keeps saying while all the other women tell their little stories . " I mean , how many men like me are still available ? How many men who look like me are also interested in sexuality as portrayed in both art and National Geographic ? " <p> " I 'll have to say my friend , Norlina . " Sue pronounces my name slowly . <p> " Hey , it 's you . " Jack leans forward and claps . " She said your name nice and slowly so they can be sure and spell it right on the card . " <p> I just sit back and wait , wondering what reasons she has . Is she going to say something about my past life ? My life with Byron ? I ca n't help but wonder if my mother is watching this . Maybe Tom and Sue had a deal . Maybe on the way to California they figured up all these little patterns with set answers , like if Bob said his typical , my friend so-and-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest bazookas ( something tacky and trashy like the way they always talk about " whoopee " ) , then Tom and Sue had decided to name me . If it had been a male friend , maybe . it would have been Jack . After all , I 've always thought that any couple with any sense could devise a system and easily win . That is , of course , if you want to win that year 's supply of tomato soup and a recliner . I sit and will Bob Eubanks to move on to the next woman , but he likes to linger with Sue . For the first time in this century Jack is quiet and it is noticeable that he has bronchial problems . <p> " Why do you say she 's strange ? " <p> " Why not ? " Sue asks and turns to the woman in the little cubicle beside her . What ! ? Has she forgotten that I 'm here on the other side of the country and on the other side of the tube ? Does she think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me behind my back and to my face so that Jack can hear about my pitiful wallflower type of youth which he will soon begin to explain ? Even if they do mean to win , enough is enough . <p> " I mean , well , there 's just no way to explain Norlina . She 's been really weird since the first day I met her . I mean , she looks weird , you know ? " Sue lifts her hands as if to explain , her mouth all screwed up and off to one side as if in imitation of how I look . <p> " Hey , that 's pretty good , " Jack says . " I 've seen you do that face before . It really requires quite a few of those facial muscles , may be related to the set of your teeth . I know every single dentist in town real well . I often play golf with two dentists . " <p> " I mean Norlina has no taste , " Sue is saying . " Not even in her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really on a roll . " She used to live with a forest ranger and before that she edited this magazine that got into all kinds of weird sex . In college all she did was sit in the bathroom . " <p> " Wait , wait , " Bob says . " Let 's hear about the weird sex . " <p> " Like really weird , " she whispers . " Like so weird ca n't even say . " <p> " Hey hey hey , " Jack says and grabs a handful of Ritz . " I want to know . I want to know . " He puts his other arm around me and jiggles . " You 've been holding out on me , firecracker . " <p> " None of it is true , " I say and move away from Jack , go and put a cup of hot water in my microwave for a cup of coffee . I do n't even want coffee , just to get away . <p> " They 're back ! " Jack screams and I return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than six words , spout an encyclopedia 's worth about me . <p> " Well , I know it 's Norlina . Long before I met the woman , Sue had prepared me , you know . Like she 'd make reference to her weird roommate , Norlina , and so like finally one day , I said , So , Sue-Sue , tell me about Norlina . Why is she so weird ? " <p> " Tom looks good on the tube , does n't he ? " Jack is sitting forward , shirt pulled up and pants hanging low enough around the belt to paint a most undesirable picture . " I think it 's because he 's got a big head . All the people who photo well on the tube have the big heads . Nancy Reagan , for starters . Think of all the stars . " <p> Believe it or not , it is my desire that Jack keep talking . <p> " Yeah , Sue has always told me how at college she was afraid to sleep some nights .

She 's been fighting some kind of tendency ever since she was the editor of a small college newspaper that boasted many alternatives to sex ; we 're not sure what this tendency is , though , if it 's lesbian or bi or , you know , nymphomania . " <p> " We 'll have to ask Jack , " Sue shrieks and locks her arm through Tom 's . She turns to Bob Eubanks and gestures with her other hand , palm upward like she 's the little teapot . " You see , Norlina is dating a friend of ours . " Come on now , Sue , I 'm thinking . Let Jack have it , too .. <p> " Great guy , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most intelligent of the kids we run with . Good old Jack , a man with a lot of valuable information .

His jaws are working in high gear . " But now I ca n't go for this double business , honey . If you 've got a problem , you know the first two things Tom mentioned , then you got ta let me in on it . I 've got myself to think of . " He crosses his leg toward the wall and locks his hands behind his neck . " I hate to think you 've been using me . " <p> " None of that is true , " I say .

I wanted a dual life ; I wanted to be accepted both outside and in . I wanted somebody who felt the same way . <p> " Thought a real man could cure you , did n't you ?

You tried and you lost . We ca n't all be a winner on ' Wheel of Fortune . ' We ca n't all be Jack 's spin . " I close the door and try one more comparison shop : <p> Children will stop in front of my house to stare . Cats with one eye and mange will make great pilgrimages to live in my part of the subdivision . I will feel humiliation and rage every time I hear Sue 's moped putter by . But also , I will never fly another flag for no reason or sit in an overcrowded , pee-warm pool or sleep in the woods with a stoned-out-ofhis-head man with poor hygiene and no words of wisdom . will never mimic anyone else 's likes and dislikes . I will stretch out on my waterbed and be grateful that some Mr. Hefty does n't make it rise and rock , be thankful that I do n't have to conjure up a dish of pork vindaloo to explain to myself why my eyes are watering . I 'll paint my Windhaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put up an eight-foot chainlink fence and plant sprigs of bamboo and kudzu on the borders of my neighbors ' yards . I 'll start an alternative paper , a little neighborhood rag for enquiring minds . I 'll even invite my mother to come visit with her purse full of dental floss and Avon samples , and I 'll show her the photos a stray camper to.ok of me on my wedding day at Buzzard 's Gap . <p> I go into the bathroom and splash warm water on my face , study myself in the mirror . After so many wrong turns , after so many dead ends , it might seem I am right back where I started ; but I know better . This time I 'm starting out with a firm list of what I do n't want in my life so that what I do want will be easier to find . I 'm also starting out with every modern convenience and appliance known to woman and man . I feel for the first time that there is a place for me in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> <p> By JILL McCORKLE <p>
