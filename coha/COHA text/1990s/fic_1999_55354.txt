Uncle Lake and Aunt Bobette lived just off the La Loma bridge that crossed the Arroyo Seco . Right after the bridge , you made your first left  --  their house was classic Pasadena , a craftsman house with a low-pitched roof , exposed rafters , dark wood shingles , and a sleeping porch vined with wisteria and grape , drab green and idle in the approaching Southern California winter . <p> I used to baby-sit for them , before I could drive , so I had a lot of time to look out the car window , how beneath the bridge the arroyo was snake-dry , you could hear the grasshoppers chipping away at the sage and wild tobacco , the accidental ping of their exoskeletons against the thorns of the holly-leaf cherry that grew down there , too . Then just as quickly you entered the formidable silence of my aunt and uncle 's neighborhood , old Pasadena homes so muffled by ivy , you had to wonder if anyone lived there at all . <p> My aunt and uncle 's house was set back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the house that featured my aunt 's strange bonsai specimens , miniature chrysanthemum , pomegranate , juniper , and other odd Lilliputian plants on which she performed experiments , wiring branches , stripping bark . <p> She was a scientist , unusual in those days . A graduate of some Ivy League college Back East . Back East : it was how we oriented ourselves in the West , in Pasadena . People were n't identified by the countries of their forebears , not exactly . They might be referred to as English-Scottish stock or of French-German extraction ( no one was pure anything , that was rare ) , but they were from Boston . They were from Philadelphia , New York , or Virginia , cities and states used interchangeably when you answered the question , " Where is your family from ? " As if you originated from some Hawthornian manse located on the Eastern seaboard . Your people were buried there in a very old cemetery somebody saw once on a trip Back East . <p> Aunt Bobette was from Boston . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Altadena , back when it was chicken farms and orange groves , an auxiliary town to Pasadena . He grew up on some ranch with blood-splattered feathers floating around , and he thought nothing of throwing old baling wire or farm implements out into the yard . Or so I imagined . Actually I knew next to nothing about Uncle Lake 's upbringing , only that he 'd married my aunt , my father 's cousin , and that she was from Back East , as they say . From money . All I really knew was that Uncle Lake grappled me into a kiss once , an open-mouth kiss , in the car as he drove me home from baby-sitting his twin sons . He made me kiss him , held his fist over the car lock until it was over . He was a heavy man , in khakis and a navy blue sport jacket , smelling of gin and cocktail nuts . The rogue society man , he fancied himself . As if a pig could join a country club . But this incident , the foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey teeth  --  this is not the point of this story . This story is n't even about Uncle Lake . I no longer care that I was forced to kiss him , after months of being cornered , twelve years old and skinny , undeveloped , whenever my aunt was out of the room . I do n't care . It 's unimportant now , it happened to so many girls my age , had always happened to girls our age , and by now we 've either dealt with it or we have n't . <p> What this story is about is transcendence . <p> I baby-sat every Saturday night , arrived around dinnertime ( driven by my father ) , delivered home around midnight . Uncle Lake and Aunt Bobette 's twin boys were toddlers , thirteen months old , just starting to walk . Their names were Sid and Paul , and I had no idea what I was doing at first . I 'd never baby-sat before , never even changed a diaper . Into my purse I 'd slipped a copy of Dr. Spock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures . Sid was rather wiggly so the first time I got B.M. all over the place before I could wipe him clean . Getting a diaper back on him was a different matter : I gave up and let him run around naked until he peed on the carpet . <p> " Come on , Sid , help me out here . " I got Dr. Spock , laid Sid out spread-eagled , unfolded the cloth diaper . The pins were what worried me . " Listen , pal , just do n't move , okay ? " <p> He gazed up at my face , eyebrows raised , as though I were a curious toy hanging above him in his crib . " Da ? " he said . <p> " Da , " I said , agreeing . Somehow I managed not to stick him with the pins , and the diaper , once I got it on him , did n't bag too much . " All right , now for the rubber pants . " <p> By now his brother had come to watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped ) , craning his neck as though watching TV . " Mama ? " he said . <p> " She 'll be back later , Paul . " <p> Once I learned how to diaper , Sid and Paul were nice company . They laughed , talked in their own companionable language . " Ba ? Da ? " Sometimes they even said words I recognized , besides " Mama , " words like " hi " or " bye , " which did n't necessarily correspond to anyone 's coming or going . They liked applesauce , mashed carrots , scrambled eggs , and their bottles , and when it was time for them to go to bed , I lay down on the floor of the sleeping porch , really their playroom , with a twin on either side . Paul was a mouth breather and usually left drool on my shoulder . <p> Sometimes Uncle Lake went away , on business trips maybe , although this was n't clear , and Aunt Bobette would let me come stay for a weekend , as her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a mother myself or any younger siblings . I could act out my favorite fantasy , silly for twelve , but I had n't outgrown it yet : that my aunt was really my mother , the twins my baby brothers . <p> While Aunt Bobette tended her bonsai , the boys and I played on the lawn , a form of toddler football . They tackled me , whether I had the " ball " ( a rubber duck ) or not . I 'd run , and they 'd hurtle after me , crawling , rolling , creeping , staggering  --  arms in front like Frankenstein for balance , diapered bottoms sticking out . <p> My aunt would stop to watch us , a clay pot in each hand . " This is so good for them , Joan . You 're really great with them . " <p> " I am ? " <p> " You are , " she said in her Boston accent , words clipped at the end , different than the joke I 'd heard , Pawk the caw in Hawvahd Yawd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , Joan ? " <p> " Sure . " I herded the boys into their playpen near the patio , thenfollowed my aunt . <p> " Here 's what you need to do , " she said , handing me an eyedropper and a vial of what looked to be tea . " Give each plant five drops . " <p> " What is it ? " I said . She was always feeding strange concoctions to her plants  --  fish bones she 'd ground up herself , fresh sheep manure . One time she even fed them blood , what kind I did n't know . Chicken blood ? <p> " It 's a new fertilizer I 'm developing , " she said . " Made of dehydrated milk and beef extract . " <p> While I gave each plant five drops , she went along with a mister . As always I marveled over her slender fingers , hands , arms , her whole body as airy as her plants . She was pretty , too , dark hair swept back into a black velvet headband , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only men had dimples there , but on her it seemed the most feminine of attributes . <p> Once , when she was showing me around the house , the very first time I baby-sat , she had sneezed . The sound of a dainty hiccup . We happened to be in the bathroom so she tore off a single sheet of toilet paper and blew her nose delicately . <p> I 'd stared . It was then that I knew I lived with men , my father and my much older brothers , whose sneezes detonated through the house ; my father 's alone could cause a roof to blast off . Not to mention the sound of him blowing his nose : like a typhoon , a gale , a cyclone . <p> " What kind of a scientist are you , Aunt Bobette ? " I asked now . <p> " Botanist . " She laughed . " But no longer . The twins , you know . " <p> " Will you go back to being a botanist ? When they 're older ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Perhaps . " <p> I sensed resignation in her voice , regret , but not about giving up botany . It was something else . <p> There was much I would have liked to ask her . What was it like growing up in Boston , did she miss it , and why had she married Uncle Lake ? Would she stay here forever and be my aunt , or would she depart in the night as my own mother had done ? <p> My mother had fallen in love , that was her crime . I could tell from the way my father said it that he did n't quite believe it . It was a ruse , an act of childish spite . A mistake she would live to regret . <p> We had this conversation many times : <p> " Why did my mother leave ? " <p> A leaden sigh . I hated to cause my father grief , but I could n't not ask . <p> " Why ? " he 'd say , gradually warming to the subject . " I still ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That we could have anything to do with her leaving us  --  was n't he supposed to avoid the very suggestion ? But my father could be alarmingly open or , when he felt the need , covert . <p> " Well , the story is this , " he 'd begin . If we happened to be nearby a mirror , my father would pause to check himself in it . Odd , this habit of looking at himself in the mirror at such a moment . As if he were telling the story to himself or to a man who looked exactly like him . " I got up on a weekday morning , it was a Wednesday , I remember , because I had to take out the trash . I sat up in bed alone , thinking your mother must 've gotten up already . " If in front of a mirror , he might smooth a hand over his thinning hair . " Did n't think anything of it at first , figured she was in the bathroom , or out in the backyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first thing in the morning . I started to get you kids your breakfast  --  that was always my job , you know . When I finally noticed she was gone was that your brothers did n't get up . That was her job , to wake you kids up . ' Where 's your mom ? ' I asked them . They did n't know . Why would they ? " <p> One of the strangest things about this story : my father never mentioned me . Maybe it was because I was still asleep that morning , or maybe unconsciously he felt I was colluding with my mother since I was a girl . Or was it that my father simply could n't bear the thought of a mother abandoning her daughter ? <p> " I started calling for her , " he 'd continue . " ' Anne ? Anne ? ' " My father would raise his voice as though calling for my mother at that very instant . As if she might actually answer him after all these years . Five years . Forever for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this point in the story that it was cruel of him , to call her name like that , right in front of me , and inevitably , I never learned from this story what I really wanted to know : what was in my mother 's character that she could desert her own children , and would I do the same to my children someday ? <p> In later years I figured out , of course , that the story was merely a distraction : a story about the morning she left , not about why she left . <p> He should have been an actor , my father . Instead he was a bank manager . He should 've acted on the weekends at least , in local productions , but instead he told this story or others like it . We 'd heard all about growing up in the Great Depression , how a man paid my father 's father money he owed him with a couple of dead chickens . Carried them into the house by their scaly feet and silently handed them over . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbed the railings of Suicide Bridge and threw themselves off . <p> The rest of the story about my mother leaving went like this : finally my father figured out she 'd left . This was later on in the morning after we 'd left for school . That 's when he found her note under his pillow ( my father had the note memorized , naturally ) : <p> Dear Jack , <p> I 've left . I 've fallen in love and we are moving Back East . I 'm so very sorry to do this to you and the children . Tell them I love them , but that the world is not a forgiving place . It 's better that we go off alone . I ca n't bear to say goodbye . <p> Respectfully , Anne She did n't leave an address . Did n't say she 'd be in touch . Did n't say she 'd send for us . Did n't mention me or my brothers by name . Signed her note " Respectfully . " I expected my father to roar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his style and his right to do so . Of all things to sign a note of abandonment with ! " Respectfully " ! As if writing a letter to the school principal or a withered old aunt . As if she 'd gotten the idea for this letter out of a bad English novel . <p> But whenever my father got to that part , the word " Respectfully , " his voice submerged to a cracked , angry whisper . His eyes glistened red , and he would turn away from me , away from the mirror if we were near one . " Goddamn her , " he would say . <p> He was a patient father , his lack of ambition for himself a saving grace , it turned out . He relied on no nannies or relatives for our care . Once I was twelve and old enough , I came home from school and minded myself , but when I was younger , he had been there . He had been there when I was sick , when I needed a costume for school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills leftover from the Army , more suited for torn uniforms and canvas , and , in the last year , he had explained menstruation and the facts of life to me , although so far it was useless information . <p> I loved him , and I wondered why he did this for me , for us . He was similarly devoted to my college-age brothers , who liked it here so much they could n't bring themselves to move out . They were copies of my father in many ways , devoted to me and to our family , yet my father had sworn if they were n't out by the end of the year , he would throw them out . They must live their own lives , he declared . Date more girls , go to parties , stay up late , learn how to handle liquor ( " So you do n't end up like your uncle Lake " ) . <p> As for my father , he never did those things . He said he left such behaviors to young people and to fools like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The Gut , The Lout , The Drunk , The Chicken Farmer . My father had a lot of names for Uncle Lake , none flattering ; still , I could n't bring myself to tell my father about the grapplings I 'd had to endure . It 'd been going on too long , for one thing  --  months . Why had n't I said something before ? At least that 's what I feared my father saying . Mostly , though , I knew telling the truth would end my baby-sitting for Sid and Paul , that I 'd no longer see my aunt , either . Our family would never see their family again . The most I could manage was to ask my father to come and pick me up , too , in addition to dropping me off , so that I would n't be alone in the car with Uncle Lake . I ca n't remember what reason I gave ; I might have mentioned Uncle Lake 's drinking , that he was weaving lanes and running red lights ( which was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to grab me , I do n't know ) . My father grumbled at first ( Lout , Drunk , Chicken Farmer ) , but he was there every Saturday at midnight sharp . No questions asked . <p> Then one night my father could n't pick me up . His car would n't start , and my brothers were n't at home ; they 'd finally listened to his advice and gone to a party . " You 're going to have to ask your uncle to drive you home , Joan . I 'm sorry . Is he too drunk ? " <p> " I ca n't tell , " I said cryptically . " Maybe . " <p> " What about your aunt Bobette ? " <p> " Asleep probably . " <p> Uncle Lake eyed me while I talked on the phone , that glazed , sagging look he 'd get , like pineapple upside-down cake . <p> " Dad , can I take a cab ? " <p> " Sure , do that . Have your uncle call you one . " <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No cab will come out this way , Joanie . " <p> Joanie . What my father used to call me when I was little , now Uncle Lake 's revolting nickname for me , but only when Aunt Bobette was n't around . <p> He cornered me by the stove . I kicked at him , but he dodged at the last minute , and I missed . " Joanie , " he said , red-faced , breathing hard , " how come you 're so mean to me ? " <p> I ran upstairs to Aunt Bobette , but she had fallen asleep , in her clothes still , on their bed . Probably so she would n't have to have sex with him . <p> " Joan ? " I heard him call . " Time to go ! " <p> I sat down beside her , touching her hand , small and so cold she might have been dead . " Aunt Bobette ? " <p> Most Saturday nights ended this way , Aunt Bobette asleep before I even left . Maybe she was drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? Being married to Uncle Lake . <p> " Oh , Joanie ! " he called up the stairs . <p> I picked up the phone and dialed my father . <p> " Joanie ! " <p> The line was busy . Who was my father calling at this hour ? I went downstairs before my uncle came up . <p> It was to be the night of The Kiss . If you could call it that . I fought but he pinned down my shoulders , all the while keeping his fist on the car lock . <p> " So you do n't like riding with me anymore , Joanie , " he said after it was over and he was driving me home , really driving me home now , in a hurry , it seemed . " What 's the matter ? Do n't like kissing an old man ? " <p> " Old , ugly , fat pig . " I wiped my mouth on my sleeve again and again . Bile washed up my throat then went back down . " I want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't like kissing men . " <p> " I do n't like kissing pigs , " I said . <p> " Maybe you like kissing girls . " <p> I tried to imagine kissing one of my friends , Sally Ortmeir , on the cheek . " What ? " I said , my voice faint . <p> " Like your mom , " he said . " Are you a lez like your mom ? Running away with her girlfriend . " He snorted . <p> It did n't register , what he was saying . <p> " I 'll tell my dad what you did . " This time bile backed up into my mouth ; I had to swallow it . My eyes ran . I began to cry . I knew what it meant to be powerless , a beetle , the boot coming down , the beetle 's hard shell crushed , what 's left a white paste . <p> " I 'll tell my dad ! " I said . <p> " What , about that back there ? " He jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or telling you the truth about your mom ? " He hummed and drove as though nothing unusual had just happened  --  accelerating , braking , the tick-tick of the turn signal  --  my heart wrenched out of my chest , turned around backwards , and shoved back inside . <p> I did n't say anything to my father about what Uncle Lake had said , not immediately . I was n't sure what I had heard , for one thing . A lez . It was what kids called our gym teacher in junior high , Miss Magda , a woman whose bug eyes seemed to appraise us when we showered , and who called us " gills , " as in " Gills , two laps " or " Gills , line up in the gym . " When we did line up , Miss Magda would go along with a clipboard checking off names . If you were having your period , you were supposed to say , " Special . " This meant you might not have to run as much , or maybe not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cramps . " Most of all it meant you were relegated to the special shower in the locker room , a private stall with a frosted glass door  --  a punishment of sorts if I were to judge from the shamed expressions of the " gills " who had to use it . <p> Miss Magda had a compact body and hairless tan legs , a whistle around her neck . Driven and lonely ; was that why she stationed herself near the locker room showers ? Was my mother like that wherever she lived Back East , an outcast , an anomaly ? <p> What about the person she ran away with ? Another woman , if Uncle Lake were to be believed . <p> He was a lout , a pig , a drunk , but I did n't think he was lying . <p> My mother . I did n't like to admit to many memories of her . <p> She looked nothing like Miss Magda , for starters . She was tall and wasp-waisted , and she always , at least in my memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the shower , a pair or two of taupe , foot-and-calf-shaped flags , like transparencies of maps of Italy , the heel and toes several shades darker , like pubic hair on a pale female body . <p> I could picture my mother living Back East , where the women " dressed , " as Aunt Bobette put it . That 's what she had said when I asked her to describe it there , the weekend after The Kiss , when Uncle Lake had left on one of his many trips . <p> " The beach is here , Joan , here in California , but the ocean "  --  the word had the weight of an Amen  --  " is there , in New England . When I think of ocean , I think of blue-gray water , water that has depth and chill to it , not the green suds they have here , and that slimy seaweed that 's always washing up onshore . " She grimaced , her button nose wrinkling . <p> I was helping her carry out her bonsai tools , concave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in the playpen Sid and Paul rolled over each other , like bear cubs . <p> " Another thing , " Aunt Bobette said , " the women dress there . " I imagined a whole country of women , turned out in sheaths and evening gowns , my mother among them , in spectator pumps , a memory hat . <p> " It 's a matter of culture , really , " my aunt was saying . " There is no culture out West- " <p> " Do you know where my mother went Back East ? Do you know where she lives ? " <p> She stood perfectly still . " Oh , Joan , I 'm sorry . " <p> " I should n't ask , " I said . " I know I should n't have asked . " <p> " Nonsense , Joan . She 's your mother , you have a right to know . I 'm just surprised your father has n't told you more . " <p> " You mean that she  --  she ran away with a woman ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I somehow think , " Aunt Bobette said , carefully arranging her tools , then looking straight at me , her eyes so green I wanted to cry , " that this is a subject you should discuss with your father . " <p> " You wo n't tell me where she lives ? " <p> " Please , Joan . " <p> I thought of the note under my father 's pillow . A crock . A lie . All to protect me , I should 've guessed . Had everybody in the whole world known except me ? <p> Still I did n't say anything to my father . He had seemed so happy lately , whistling and doing yard work on the weekends . It was spring , winter everywhere else in the country , winter Back East , but spring here . Plants which had kept their leaves all winter surged forth with bright green growth , while bulbs shot up and popped open , like speeded-up film  --  this was n't like other places , where spring arrived cautiously . Here , overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees grew new limbs ; flowers carpeted garden paths , vacant lots , twined their way up the sides of houses : a frantic display of spring before , overnight again , the weather would turn hot and smoggy , everything not hooked up to a sprinkler becoming gnarled , leathery and tough . <p> My own torpid body  --  flat nipples like blighted seeds  --  seemed impervious to the lure of spring . I turned inward , read a lot of books , read everything  --  backs of cereal boxes , return addresses on mail , clothing labels . I avoided going outside , pained by all that fervent growth , left out , bereft . <p> Even my brothers carried on like randy elk . They had fallen in love with pretty college girls , each of them , and now neither one was around much , neither available to answer questions about my mother . <p> When I was n't reading whatever was in front of me , I immersed myself in the junior high chorus , me and twenty other girls exercising our vocal cords , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as if we were pleading for nourishment . I could n't help noticing most of us were frail and flat-chested , our skin bluish and chalky . We sang like frightened calves about to be slaughtered for veal , which is to say we sounded awful , except for Val Vossman , who sang longingly in her woman 's voice , " Oh , my heart is back in Napoli , oh Napoli , oh Napoli , and I seem to hear again in dreams , your melody , your sweet melody . " She appeared ten years older than she was , her body , not her face . She was Mormon . She wore no makeup . Val resembled Jane Russell in the bra commercials ( the meaner girls , the " developed " catty girls , called her Va-Va-VOOM ) , yet Val dressed conservatively in dresses , never skirts or culottes , bobbie socks , and navy blue Keds ; in chorus , her breasts heaved incongruously just below the white of her starched Peter Pan collars . <p> Mormon . I thought this meant all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden , windowless rooms in the backs of houses , people with veiled , downcast eyes , nonetheless watching you . Constant spiritual surveillance . Praying for your soul . Val was tight-lipped on the subject ; I know because she became my best friend . We were drawn together as kids that age are , often because of some similarity , or infirmity , usually physical : blond hair , athletic ability , or the need to wear glasses . Val and I were n't similar physically , of course . She towered over me , voluptuously , while I hopped along beside her , two steps for her every one , always wearing my cardigan sweater from fourth grade that still fit me  --  I was constantly cold , I had no body fat whatsoever . <p> Our affinity was mothers . Neither of us had one anymore , hers dead , mine gone . We talked about it all the time , what it felt like to grow up without a mother . I told Val about being in a school play , another girl patting my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment forever  --  how much I looked forward to rehearsals just for that . How embarrassed I felt . <p> " I know , " she would say . " I actually liked it when I got my first bra and the woman at Bullocks fitted me for it . She had to touch me to do it  --  the measuring tape , adjusting straps . I was in heaven , but sad , you know ? " <p> I nodded , we both sighed , me with worry : this hunger for touch , did it mean I was attracted to women ? Or did it mean I simply missed having a mother ? And what was Val talking about , a woman touching her . Did this mean she was a lez ? That we both were ? <p> I became terrified that Val would drop me , that she would see something unsavory in me  --  there might be some Mormon commandment about my kind of loss , that I was damned because of my mother . I felt damned . Val 's mother , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cancer and left Earth a beautiful angel , a mother whose memory a daughter could cherish . <p> Then one night I stayed over at Val 's . Though no one said as much , we could n't do it the other way around , I think-a good Mormon girl staying in a mostly male household . Val had sisters , albeit younger sisters ; she was the oldest . Her father mostly stayed in the living room while we cared for the sisters , three of them , all with their hair done up in braids , buns , ribbons . We gave them baths , we redid their hair , we read them stories , we put them to bed . <p> At last it was time for us to go to sleep . Val wore a long white nightgown with a high neck ; I had on my PJs ( with teddy bears on them , also leftover from fourth grade ) . She had twin beds in her room , but after lying there in the dark for a while , I asked if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> I felt more peaceful there , and safe . I wondered if this was because Val was Mormon  --  if I should become Mormon . Would it wash my sins away , the sins of my mother ? Would I become as pure as Val ? <p> " When you grew bosoms , " I asked her ( I did n't know what to call them , what the best technical term was ) , " breasts , I mean , what did it feel like ? " <p> " What did it feel like ? " <p> " Not what it felt like exactly , but when you touched them , did they feel a certain way ? " <p> " Like how ? " she said . <p> " Well , all of a sudden I have these bumps underneath . It 's like there 's some fat on top and then something harder underneath . " <p> " Sort of like cartilage ? " <p> " Yeah , maybe . Would you check them for me ? " I blurted out . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  see if they 're normal ? " <p> " Well , okay . " She did n't sound so sure . <p> " You do n't have to , " I said . " Forget it . " <p> " No , I will . " She got up on her knees and turned on the reading light . " I know . I 'm pretty sure I felt that way , too- " <p> " Nobody to ask , " I said . " I ca n't ask my father ! " " Lift your shirt , " she said . <p> I did . <p> " Normal as far as I can tell . You 're growing breasts ! So are you glad ? " <p> " I guess . It 's sort of weird . Is it normal to have that cartilage stuff ? Like a ridge , kind of . " <p> " Do you want me to feel ? " she said , her fingers poised . <p> " All right . " <p> She probed around , as if she were a doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was just growing , and what sort of bra was I going to get ? " It 's a little early for that , " I said , suddenly sleepy . I did n't move back to my bed but rested my head on her shoulder , part of her breast yielding to my chin . I gazed up at her face in profile , an ethereal face , Botticelli hair ; she could have been stepping out of Venus 's clamshell , into thin air . She might have been a departed angel herself . Thankfully I felt nothing besides that , except love . <p> I dreamt of my mother that night , dressed in something coarse and ragged . She was trying to write me a letter but kept crumpling it up and starting over again . I stood by her desk to read what she was writing , but I could n't make it out . <p> Dear Joan , <p> Writing this is like talking into the wind . <p> I 'm sorry I left . I did n't have a choice . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love your father but I could n't . I am attracted to women . Do you know what that means ? It means I ca n't love your father , though I respect him . <p> I want to see you again . How about if you came Back East to visit me next summer ? We 'd have a lot of fun ! There 's so much to do here that you would enjoy  --  the swan boats at the Public Garden , tea at the Parker House , Paul Revere 's house . <p> I handed the letter to my father , my shoulders sinking into my rib cage , as though I were collapsing inside myself , bones , muscle , gristle . <p> " What is this ? " he said , wiping his face with the T-shirt he 'd tossed aside earlier . He 'd been gardening bare-chested , and he smelled of sweat , man 's sweat . I wondered if such a smell disgusted my mother . <p> " Read it , " I said . <p> With my eyes , the only part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our old pet turtle lumbering around , plowing at the ground stiffly , in slow motion , his ancient , reptilian legs so thick he felt nothing . <p> " This is in your handwriting , " my father said . " What is this ? " <p> I could not lift my shoulders , not even to shrug them . " A letter from my mother . " <p> " You know that 's impossible . This is in your handwriting , and you do n't ... Who told you about your mother ? " My father emerged from his thicket of rhododendron , pulling his shirt on over his stinking , hairy chest . " We need to talk about this , Joanie . Now . Let 's go inside . " <p> Joanie . He had n't called me that in a long time , only Uncle Lake had ; the name was poison , all the horrible things that had happened since my mother left five years ago , in one bad word . <p> Numbly , I followed my father to our kitchen . We sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in front of him . I 'd crumpled it into a ball so many times , it was soft , like velvet . <p> " I was planning to tell you , Joan , of course . " My father wagged his head , confused . " I do n't even know where to start . Who  --  " <p> I snatched up the letter and ran for the front door , hollering , " Why did n't you tell me ? Why the hell did n't you tell me ? ! " <p> He caught up with me a block away , in front of the Nelsons ' house , who probably knew all about this , anyway . My father reached out , grabbed my arm , and got me into some kind of straight-jacket hold . Panting , he spoke softly in my ear . " First , Joan , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . You 're right to be mad , I should 've told you . I wanted to protect you , keep you a child a while longer . Secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : who told you ? " <p> " What difference does it make , the whole frigging town knows ! " <p> " Who told you ? " <p> " Not you , that 's for damn sure . " My second curse word , and he did n't say anything . <p> I did n't wait for him to ask again . <p> " Uncle Lake told me , " I said . " That and a lot of other things I should n't know . " I stopped flailing , but my father did n't let go of me . The same old bile backed up into my mouth , as if it 'd been waiting there all this time . <p> He turned me around slowly to face him . " What are you talking about , Joan ? " <p> I coughed , sputtered really , and threw up on the ground between us . <p> Everybody came to our spring concert . I was surprised that twenty girls could have so many relatives , and as usual , I felt at a loss . Their mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhere in Boston , well-dressed and with her true love , but otherwise miserable . Living in some walk-up apartment in a despised neighborhood of the city , or perhaps she lived in one of the best sections , on Beacon Hill : a whole hill of defiant , lustful women , in Chanel suits and Italian shoes . <p> I suppose deep inside I 'd hoped my mother would attend my concert , although she had no idea I was singing today , had no idea about anything I did . How much of her leaving us was the fact of her lesbianism in such unenlightened times , and how much the fact that motherhood or us , her children , simply did n't interest her ? <p> I would never seek her out . Nor her me . <p> Twenty years later I would attend the concert of my own daughter , and at the sight of her coltish , bean-pole body clothed in lime-green velveteen , a dress we had bought the day before , I wanted to weep . The braces on her teeth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturing face , one moment a teenager 's , the next the face of a child  --  how dare my mother miss this metamorphosis , mine , my daughter 's ? <p> To my own spring concert I wore my best dress , which chafed me under the arms , too tight around the chest ; underneath was my first bra , crossing my thin chest with a tiny embroidered flower , keeping me in check , mending my poor posture , my broken heart . <p> Aunt Bobette had taken me to buy the bra , several weeks after Uncle Lake moved out for good , no one knew where , his nose broken personally by my father , who quoted Gandhi as he undertook the chore . <p> My aunt , furious at what Uncle Lake had done to me , was only too glad to kick him out . <p> Besides my father and my brothers and their pretty girlfriends , Aunt Bobette also came to hear me sing , with Sid and Paul , who wiggled in their seats , da-da-ing , ba-ba-ing , pointing and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang as though born to it that day , harmonizing alongside Val . " Oh I seem to hear again in dre-e-ams , your melody , your sweet melody . The mandolinas play so sweet , the dancing sound of pra-a-a-ancing feet . Oh could I go back , oh joy complete  --  Napoli , Napoli , Napoli ! " <p> I sang until my jaw ached , until my soul escaped . My mother flew out as well , to Back East , land of fog and swans , ocean , mystery : I watched her depart . Soon the blood would fall from my womb , dripping in sorrow for my mother . Like her , I would stain the earth ; I would pay for my sins , bear my children in pain and suffering . I sang . <p> <p> By Emily Hammond <p>
