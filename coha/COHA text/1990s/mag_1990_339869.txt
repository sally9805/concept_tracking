Of all the obscenities of war , none is as inexcusable as the deliberate slaughter of civilians . Yet much of the world is silent now , though millions of innocent Africans stand in jeopardy of extinction . These people will not die by the sword or the other traditional implements of war . Instead , they will be slain by one of the cruelest weapons of any era  --  starvation . They will die slowly and painfully ; in a world of abundance , they will die hungry . <P> And most of the dying will be done in the Horn of Africa . In Ethiopia upwards of 4.5 million people , more than four times the number wiped out by the great famine of 1984-85 , may starve this year if food relief is not provided  --  and soon . In Sudan , where as many as a quarter of a million people died of hunger in 1987-88 , the most dire estimates suggest that 3 million could suffer the same fate by the middle of this decade . Once again the world may see those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flies that swarm around their eyes ; old people slumped against herding sticks , too weary to take another step . <P> Famine in Africa may seem like yesterday 's news . This time , however , the prospect of mass starvation is not just the caprice of nature but is largely the work of man . Drought and crop failures have not gone unnoticed . Wealthy donor nations have pledged hundreds of thousands of tons of foodstuffs . Distribution networks exist to allocate the food . Relief convoys stand ready to move it . All that separates millions of malnourished Ethiopians and Sudanese from the food that could save their lives is a handful of stubborn men : President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia , Lieut . General Omar Hassan el Bashir , the head of Sudan 's 15-man junta , and the rebel leaders opposing them . All are more intent upon winning their wars than feeding the people they are supposedly fighting for . " If people die this time , it is not going to be because of the drought but because of the military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Jesuit based in Nairobi . <P> ETHIOPIA . The last time famine visited , the rains had failed for three years and people were already dying before the world awakened to the tragedy . This time most of the country had a better than normal harvest in 1988 and crop failures are confined to the northern provinces of Eritrea , Tigre and Wollo . Moreover , there is food in the relief pipeline ; last week the United Nations ' ) World Food Program announced an additional $8 million in emergency food aid , and the European Community raised its pledge $12 million . <P> Yet a hunger crisis may hit as early as March because most of the people at risk are trapped behind lines controlled by the three insurgent armies battling Mengistu 's troops . Mengistu so far refuses to let relief convoys enter rebel-controlled territories for fear the food may go toward feeding the insurgents or the trucks may be ferrying arms to them . His obstinacy follows a year of humiliating defeats for his forces in Eritrea and Tigre .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
