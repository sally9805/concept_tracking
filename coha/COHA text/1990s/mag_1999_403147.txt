Whether you 're looking for growth , steady income or foreign exposure , our dozen picks offer a wealth of opportunity for the year ahead . // HOW LONG WILL THE GOOD TIMES LAST ? That 's the question every investor would like to have answered with 100% certainty . Obviously , that 's not realistic . But one thing we do know for sure about the year ahead : Some companies will thrive , creating significant wealth for investors fortunate enough to be along for the ride . The hard part , of course , is finding those companies . That 's what our investment team set out to do for this article , poring over reams of financial data , grilling Wall Street 's best analysts , persuading the investment community 's most accomplished money managers to share their best ideas . We also put one another through the wringer , questioning every assumption , every source of information , until we were convinced that we 'd found the most compelling opportunities around . For individual stock picks , we focused on four sectors-technology , telecommunications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five stocks ; our sixth is a restructuring play . We also identified three opportunities for income investors ( see the box on page 91 ) , two international picks ( the facing page ) , and one for small-caps ( page 92 ) . While there are n't any guarantees in investing , we 're confident that these 12 investments can deliver . ( Fund performance is through Nov. 30 ; all other data are as of Dec. 3 . ) TECHNOLOGY : HARDWARE mAKING THE CASE for the tech nn sector is n't difficult : If one part of the U.S. economy is booming . it 's tech . Our reliance on computers , the Internet and semiconductor chips is growing exponentially . Photograph // SIX GREAT STOCKS FOR ' 99 // KLA-TENCOR . We believe that the best investment opportunity in tech hardware over the next 12 months is in the semiconductor industry , in particular semiconductor equipment makers . As a group , the stocks were damaged by last year 's Asian crisis-far more than they should have been . Nonetheless , as chips get smaller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now spend an average of 23% of annual revenues on capital equip ment , up from 18% two decades ago . KLA-Tencor is the dominant player in the fastest-growing major segment of the business : metrology , or wafer inspection . And when we say dominant , we mean it-90% market share . As the chip cycle reaches its sweet spot-within two years or so-the company 's gross margins will near 60% , which would more than double its per-share earnings . The stock traded as high as $75.50 two years ago and is now at $42.75 . Earnings are currently depressed ( inflating the stock 's P/E ) but should rise to $2.20 a share for calendar-year 2000 . ( Tech stocks tend to trade on future earnings , so 1999 's stock performance will reflect projections for 2000 earnings . ) At 2S times 2000 earnings , in line with the company 's growth rate , that would translate to a share price in the mid-$50 range a year from now , 25% above current levels . TECHNOLOGY : SOFTWARE THERE 'S TROUBLE IN softwareland . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obsessed with Y2K problems that they 'll put off new purchases . NETWORK ASSOCIATES . But when gloom overtakes an industry , great opportunities follow . Case in point : Network Associates , a maker of network-management software , particularly for security . The company boasts a renewal rate above 100% , meaning that most customers increase purchases when their subscriptions expire . In mid-1999 , Network Associates is slated to release a combined version of two of its most popular products . At $51.25 a share , Network Associates stock is trading at 24 times estimated 1999 earnings , one of the lowest P/Es in the software industry . Why ? Because , over the past two years , the company purchased eight firms , giving the stock what analyst Paul Dravis of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities calls " acquisition overhang . " Yet the company has n't missed a step . In November , Network Associates announced the release of its new antivirus product-ahead of schedule . And profitability is climbing : Net margin , 19.1% in the first quarter of 1997 , reached 24.7% in the third quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is poised to deliver bottom-line growth of 33% annually That means that even without significant PtE expansion , the stock could rise two or three times as fast as the overall market . " There are no excess expectations built into this stock 's price , " says Curt Rohrman , manager of the USAA Science &; Technology fund , who sees the stock hitting $88 within 12 months . TELECOMMUNICATIONS FORGET THE DAYS when Ma Bell and the masters of long distance ruled the roost . Telecom today is n't just about phone calls but also Internet traffic and data transmission . The world is wired and becoming even more so-fast . MCI WORLDCOM . The company best placed strategically to profit from that trend is MCI WorldCom , which offers the most comprehensive end-to-end communications service available for businesses , including long distance , local calling , Internet and data . It is the second largest long-distance carrier in the U.S. , and its fiber-optic network handles half of the world 's Internet traffic . And in its latest quarter , the company 's Internet , international and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That sets MCI WorldCom apart from most other big stocks : It 's the only company in the S &P; 500 with sales of more than $30 billion that has double-digit sales growth and 30%-plus profit growth . " WorldCom is the must own ' large-cap growth stock , " says Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman . Here 's the best part : Many mutual fund managers have yet to discover the stock . Only 11 of the 50 biggest growth funds and just seven of the 50 biggest capital-appreciation funds held the stock in mid-November , according to Grubman . As 1999 progresses and growth becomes harder to come by , you can bet that many of those funds will be buying WorldCom , big-time . And while the $60-a-share stock is already trading at 30 times expected 1999 earnings , that 's hardly excessive for a company with projected earnings growth of 150% in 1999 and SO% in 2000 . PHARMACEUTICALS NO INDUSTRY HAS come closer to universal endorsement by Wall Street than the big drugmakers . They 're not too exposed to foreign economic mayhem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boast product pipelines stuffed with promising new elixirs . No surprise then that most top drug stocks sell at P/Es at least double that of the average stock . But one firm has been greatly underappreciated . MONSANTO . Wall Street still views St. Louis-based Monsanto as more a chemical stock than a drug stock , even though it exited the chemical biz more than a year ago . Meanwhile , the pipeline of its drug unit-which already accounts for a fourth of the company 's profits-has some of the most anticipated products in the industry , led by Celebrex , a new type of pain reliever . Final FDA approval for the drug is expected in the first quarter of 1999 ; analysts figure Celebrex could garner $500 million in sales in 1999 and reach $1.5 billion in 2001 . Monsanto also has a large agricultural-biotech business , making it arguably the world 's premier " life sciences " company Monsanto 's stock has suffered for two reasons : fallout from American Home Products ' failed $36 billion merger bid last summer , and concerns that $6 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late November , the firm raised $4.2 billion by issuing new stock , convertibles and bonds , and it 's now exploring the sale of businesses worth as much as $1 billion . At a recent $43 , the stock may look pricey : Earnings for 1999 could come in under $1 a share . But those reported profits are distorted by amortization and other accounting charges . The number to keep in mind is the $60 a share that AHP was willing to pay last summer . For five years , Monsanto has been investing heavily in its growth . " Now the company is moving into the ' returns ' phase of the cycle , " says fund manager Chris Bonavico of Transamerica Premier Funds . " And the returns could be dramatic . " FINANCIAL SERVICES TODAY 'S LOW-INFLATION , low-interest-rate economy ought to help financial companies , particularly those with U.S.-based businesses . We 've found an ideal , yet unrecognized , beneficiary : an insurer of municipal bonds . FINANCIAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE . Looking at today 's low interest rates , state and local governments ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . The result : The volume of outstanding munis is at an alltime high-$1.4 trillion in bonds outstanding-and growing fast . And muni bond insurance ? It 's a great business . Insurers are paid all the premiums for insuring a bond up front . They can also insure to a so-called zero-loss standardavoiding any bond that looks risky . ( From 1988 to 1997 , the industry 's losses equaled only 0.01% of the face value of insured bonds outstanding , according to Fitch IBCA . ) The biggest muni insurer is MBIA , but its raw size has begun to work against it . As Sabra Brinkmann , an analyst at Advest , puts it : " MBIA has insured such a large percentage of issues that some fund managers concerned with risk management do n't want to add its bonds to their portfolios . " That concern has allowed Financial Security Assistance , a smaller , aggressive competitor , to gain market share . Since 1995 , FSA 's share of total premiums has grown from 15% to 22% . Its stock recently traded at $52.25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a company boosting annual earnings at a 12% to 15% clip with extremely low risk . RESTRUCTURING WHEN COMPANIES change direction , it often takes a while for investors to catch on-but when they do , the stock can really move . We 've found one that is poised for action . ITT INDUSTRIES . A year ago , ITT Industries was a hodgepodge of unrelated businesses thrown together in the 1995 breakup of ITT . It had a burdensome 72% debtto-capital ratio , and one-third of its sales came from an auto-parts division with 2% margins . So what 's happened since then ? In September , the company announced that it was selling the auto unit for $2.6 billion after tax . It will use the proceeds to pay down debt and buy back at least 1.1 million shares . ITT Industries announced more cost cutting in December . Now the company 's remaining businesses ( high-tech defense electronics and water pumps used for irrigation and sewage ) should jack up earnings growth to 14% . All that creates considerable upside for the stock , which recently traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even an increase to a P/E of 18-in line with ITT Industries ' historical P/E relative to the market-would provide a return of nearly 25% in 1999 . The stock also carries a 1.6% yield . Here 's the kicker : The company has some $600 million in cash , or $6.49 a share , on its balance sheet . Ed Track this portfolio . For the latest on these investments , see our continuously updated summary on the Web at money.com/bestinvest . Sidebar INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THE CASE FOR investing overseas remains as strong as ever-increased diversification and the potential for outsize gains . We see two distinct strategies for playing world markets in ' 99 : riding those that are moving well , and seeking out those that are down in anticipation of an imminent rebound . Scudder Greater Europe Growth . Europe has been the hot spot internationally , and the European Monetary Union 's surprise interest-rate cut on Dec. 3 augurs well for further growth . Companies on the Continent are still in the early stages of a U.S.-style restructuring ( cutting costs and merging ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel double-digit profit growth . Still , European stocks look relatively cheap : The stocks in the MSCI Europe index trade at 21 times trailing earnings , vs. 26 times for the S &P; 500 . The Scudder Greater Europe Growth fund is our choice : Its 26.4% three-year annual average return beats 98% of other Europe funds . Templeton Emerging Markets . The fact that the past 18 months have been so lousy for emerging markets is reason enough to bet on a rebound . That 's what the godfather of international investing , Sir John Templeton , is doing ( see page 102 ) . Again , we like mutual funds for playing this region , but open-end funds have their drawbacks : If some shareholders rush to cash out , managers can be forced to sell stocks at low prices , That 's why we suggest the closed-end Templeton Emerging Markets , whose shares trade like a stock on the New York Stock Exchange . The shares , which normally trade at a big premium to the portfolio 's net asset value ( 22% a year ago ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's record is first rate : Over 10 years , it has returned an average of 18.6% annually , vs. 1.9% for the benchmark emerging markets index . - PR . Sidebar LOOKING FOR INCOME WHEN INTEREST RATES tumble to 30-year lows and 30-year Treasuries are yielding a scant 5.2% , income investors do n't have an easy time finding great picks . But after scouring the marketplace , we 've identified three . Simon Property Group . The largest owner and operator of regional malls , this real estate investment trust pays out a secure 6 . Soto annual dividend . And there 's a strong likelihood of price appreciation as well . Funds from operations ( a cash-flow measure used to value REITs ) should increase 9% this year . In addition , the company could pull in $30 million this year from deals with the likes of Pepsi , Visa and the NFL to create marketing programs aimed at the more than 100 million people who visit Simon 's malls annually . " This is a blue-chip REIT that is going to deliver growth in 1999 , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds offer another type of opportunity : Benchmark junk issues are now paying 5.4 percentage points more than Treasuries ; the margin was just 2.5 points a year ago . For junk bonds , we suggest a mutual fund : Northeast Investors Trust , managed by the father-and-son team of Ernie and Bruce Monrad . They 've been aggressive about buying longer-term bonds . They 've also put an above-average 12% of assets in the highest-paying issues . But they know how to manage risk . The fund has earned an annual average of 11.5% over the past decade , vs. 9.4% for its average competitor , yet it 's been 75% less volatile , according to Morningstar . Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt . For people in top tax brackets , today 's best income idea is municipal bonds . Tax-exempt yields on top-quality 10-year munis now pay 4.2% , the equivalent of 6.7% for investors in the highest tax bracket . That compares with 4.7% for 10-year Treasuries . Unless you have more than $25,000 to invest , a mutual fund is most cost-effective . Vanguard IntermediateTerm Tax-Exempt charges only 0.18% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets in AAA-rated bonds and is currently paying a 4.9% yield . - D.M. and PR . Sidebar SMALL-CAP GROWTH SMALL-COMPANY STOCKS have trailed the S &P; 500 for nearly four years , but there are signs that the losing streak is ending . From a 1998 low on Oct. 8 , the Russell 2000 index gained 28% through Nov. 30 , vs. 21% for the S &P; 500 . And small stocks still have a way to go before they catch up-their P/Es are currently an average of 25% below those of blue chips . To make the most : of a small-cap rally in 1999 , we recommend going with a small-cap growth fund-a sentiment echoed by even some of the best small-cap value managers . " Growth stocks always do better in a strong environment for small-caps , says Chuck Royce , president and portfolio manager of the Royce Funds . Brazos/JMIC Small Cap Growth . Our favorite small growth fund is skippered by John McStay and his 10 co-managers . Not yet two years old , the fund still has a small enough asset base ( about $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . In addition , McStay &; Co. have a stellar long-term record . For the past 12 years , they have earned an average of more than 20% annually in similar institutional accounts . Unlike some small-cappers , Brazos is n't a tech fund in disguise . The managers also seek out fast growers in niche industries , from Bright Horizons Family Solutions , which runs corporate day-care centers , to Cinar Films , which makes direct-to-video cartoons . - RR. // <p>
