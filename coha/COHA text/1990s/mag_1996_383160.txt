You keep the ball in play most of the time , but a lack of distance puts pressure on your game . // JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY crouches behind the ball and reads the break of their putt . But do you take the time to read chips and pitches ? You should . Because distance is not your strength , getting up and down has to be . Chips and pitches have more variables ( carry , bounce , roll ) to worry about than any other shot , so it 's unrealistic to think you can merely " hit at the hole . " Maximize your scoring opportunities by considering some of the following factors on your chips and pitches . THE LINE THE ROLL ON YOUR CHIP AND PITCH is as important as the carry and bounce , so go the extra step and read the break from your intended landing spot to the hole . Unless the situation is extreme , every short shot is makeable . Treat them that way . BEST SIDE OF THE CUP AT THE SAME TIME , try to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole is nice , but suppose you leave the ball five feet away . Would you rather that five-footer be a downhill slider or straight uphill ? Rather than just trying to get the ball inside a circle , imagine a half circle-the half below the cup-and try to hit the ball there . BUNKER HUMPS FEW THINGS ARE MORE FRUSTRATING than hitting what you think is a good pitch over a bunker only to have it kick off the backside and shoot across the green , way past the hole . This misfortune can be avoided simply by being careful . If you 're facing a shot over a bunker , check the other side . Very often there will be a hump on the green that can springboard your ball past the hole . In these cases , consider the hump part of the bunker and play a higher , softer-landing shot that rolls less . WIND AND GRAIN : SPIN FACTORS PLAYERS OFTEN SURPRISE THEMSELVES with how much or how little a pitch shot will spin under certain circumstances . Having a good lie and solid contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind direction and the grain of the green play a part . All greens are different , depending upon wetness , length of grass , and other factors , but the basic idea is this : Do n't expect a ball to spin if it 's landing with the grain or with the wind . If your shot is downgrain and downwind , beware . A regular pitch shot can become a delicate pitch-and-run . Similarly , hitting into the grain and/or wind will reduce roll . Be aware before you play your shot so you can adjust accordingly . You hit the ball along way but rarely as straight as you want . Your game needs // Read the break from your intended landing spot to the hole . Imagine a half circle below the hole , and try to hit the ball there . // Check the far side of a bunker to avoid kicking off a hump and running past the hole . // with wind and grain Against wind and grain // control and consistency . POWER HITTERS , who normally go full bore on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . When the pressure 's on , you say to yourself , " Make a smooth backswing and do n't rush . " Invariably , you take the club back on a herky-jerky path and miss the putt . It 's not that you 're incapable of a smooth stroke , it 's just that your mind has done a number on you . Break this negative thought pattern by focusing on a different physical action . Instead of thinking about how to move the putter back , focus on starting the motion with a forward press of your hands . This slight movement toward the hole accomplishes two things : First , it gets you thinking about the target rather than the stroke , which frees your mind ; second , it sets your hands in motion before the putterhead , which reduces tension in your body . // Begin your stroke with a forward press of your hands , which allows you to think about the target , not your stroke , and reduces tension . // When you make a forward press , the backswing happens naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend less time thinking about your stroke and more on rolling the ball into the hole . <p>
