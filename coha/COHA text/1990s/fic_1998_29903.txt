Phillip loosened the windsor knot in his Fendi tie . It was a long commute from Baltimore to Maryland 's Eastern Shore , and he 'd programmed his CD player with that in mind . He started out mellow with a little Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . Thursday-evening traffic was as bad as predicted , made worse by the sluggish rain and the rubberneckers who could n't resist a long , fascinated goggle at the three-car accident on the Baltimore Beltway . By the time he was heading south on Route 50 , even the hot licks of vintage Stones could n't completely lift his mood . He 'd brought work with him and somehow had to eke out time for the Myerstone Tire account over the weekend . They wanted a whole new look for this advertising campaign . Happy tires make happy drivers , Phillip thought , drumming his fingers on the wheel to the rhythm of Keith Richards 's outlaw guitar . Which was a crock , he decided . Nobody was happy driving in rainy rush-hour traffic , no matter what rubber covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would make the consumers think that riding on Myerstones would make them happy , safe , and sexy . It was his job , and he was good at it . Good enough to juggle four major accounts , supervise the status of six lesser ones , and never appear to break a sweat within the slick corridors of Innovations , the well-heeled advertising firm where heworked . The firm that demanded style , exuberance , and creativity from its executives . They did n't pay to see him sweat . Alone , however , was a different matter . He knew he 'd been burning not a candle but a torch at both ends for months . With one hard slap of fate he 'd gone from living for Phillip Quinn to wondering what had happened to his cheerfully upwardly mobile urban lifestyle . His father 's death six months before had turned his life upside down . The life that Ray and Stella Quinn had righted seventeen years ago . They 'd walked into that dreary hospital room and offered him a chance and a choice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that he had no choice . Going back on the streets was n't as appealing as it had been before his chest had been ripped open by bullets . Living with his mother was no longer an option , not even if she changed her mind and let him buy his way back into the cramped apartment on Baltimore 's Block . Social Services was taking a hard look at the situation , and he knew he 'd be dumped into the system the minute he was back on his feet . He had no intention of going back into the system , or back with his mother , or back to the gutter , for that matter . He 'd already decided that . He felt that all he needed was a little time to work out a plan . At the moment that time was buffered by some very fine drugs that he had n't had to buy or steal . But he did n't figure that little benefit was going to last forever . With the Demerol sliding through his system , he gave the Quinns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weirdo do-gooders . That was fine with him . They wanted to be Samaritans , give him a place to hang out until he was back to a hundred percent , good for them . Good for him . They told him they had a house on the Eastern Shore , which for an inner-city kid was the other end of the world . But he figured a change of scene could n't hurt . They had two sons about his age . Phillip decided he would n't have to worry about a couple of wimps that the do-gooders had raised . They told him they had rules , and education was a priority . School did n't bother him any . He breezed his way through when he decided to go . No drugs . Stella said that in a cool voice that made Phillip reevaluate her as he put on his most angelic expression and said a polite No , ma'am . He had no doubt that when he wanted a hit , he 'd be able to find a source , even in some bumfuck town on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shrewd , her mouth smiling thinly . You have a face that belongs on a Renaissance painting . But that does n't make you less of a thief , a hoodlum , and a liar . We 'll help you if you want to be helped . But do n't treat us like imbeciles . And Ray laughed his big , booming laugh . He squeezed Stella 's shoulder and Phillip 's at the same time . It would be , Phillip remembered he 'd said , a rare treat to watch the two of them butt heads for the next little while . They came back several times over the next two weeks . Phillip talked with them and with the social worker , who 'd been much easier to con than the Quinns . In the end they took him home from the hospital , to the pretty white house by the water . He met their sons , assessed the situation . When he learned that the other boys , Cameron and Ethan , had been taken in much as he had been , he was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . For a doctor and a college professor they had n't collected an abundance of easily stolen or fenced , valuables . But he scoped out what there was . Instead of stealing from them , he fell in love with them . He took their name and spent the next ten years in the house by the water . Then Stella had died , and part of his world dropped away . She had become the mother he 'd never believed existed . Steady , strong , loving , and shrewd . He grieved for her , that first true loss of his life . He buried part of that grief in work , pushing his way through college , toward a goal of success and a sheen of sophisticationand an entry-level position at Innovations . He did n't intend to remain on the bottom rung for long . Taking the position at Innovations in Baltimore was a small personal triumph . He was going back to the city of his misery , but he was going back as a man of taste . No one seeing the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a petty thief , a sometime drug dealer , and an occasional prostitute . Everything he 'd gained over the last seventeen years could be traced back to that moment when Ray and Stella Quinn had walked into his hospital room . Then Ray had died suddenly , leaving shadows that had yet to be washed with the light . The man Phillip had loved as completely as a son could love a father had lost his life on a quiet stretch of road in the middle of the day when his car had met a telephone pole at high speed . There was another hospital room . This time it was the Mighty Quinn lying broken in the bed with machines gasping . Phillip , along with his brothers , had made a promise to watch out for and to keep the last of Ray Quinn 's strays , another lost boy . But this boy had secrets , and he looked at you , with Ray 's eyes . The talk around the waterfront and the neighborhoods of the little town of St. Christopher 's on Maryland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal . In the six months since the whispers had started , Phillip felt that he and his brothers had gotten no closer to finding the truth . Who was Seth DeLauter and what had he been to Raymond Quinn ? Another stray ? Another half-grown boy drowning in a vicious sea of neglect and violence who so desperately needed a lifeline ? Or was he more ? A Quinn by blood as well as by circumstance ? All Phillip could be sure of was that ten-year-old Seth was his brother as much as Cam and Ethan were his brothers . Each of them had been snatched out of a nightmare and given a chance to change their lives . With Seth , Ray and Stella were n't there to keep that choice open . There was a part of Phillip , a part that had lived inside a young , careless thief , that resented even the possibility that Seth could be Ray 's son by blood , a son conceived in adultery and abandoned in shame . It would be a betrayal of everything the Quinns had taught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had . He detested himself for considering it , for knowing that now and then he studied Seth with cool , appraising eyes and wondered if the boy 's existence was the reason Ray Quinn was dead . Whenever that nasty thought crept into his mind , Phillip shifted his concentration to Gloria DeLauter . Seth 's mother was the woman who had accused Professor Raymond Quinn of sexual harassment . She claimed it had happened years before , while she was a student at the university . But there was no record of her ever attending classes there . The same woman had sold her ten-year-old son to Ray as if he 'd been a package of meat . The same woman , Phillip was certain , that Ray had been to Baltimore to see before he had driven homeand driven himself to his death . She 'd taken off . Women like Gloria were skilled in skipping out of harm 's way . Weeks ago , she 'd sent the Quinns a not-so-subtle blackmail letter : If you want to keep the kid , I need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear on Seth 's face when he 'd learned of it . She was n't going to get her hands on the boy , he told himself . She was going to discover that the Quinn brothers were a tougher mark than one softhearted old man . Not just the Quinn brothers now , either , he thought as he turned off onto the rural county road that would lead him home . He thought of family as he drove fast down a road flanked by fields of soybeans , of peas , of corn grown taller than a man . Now that Cam and Ethan were married , Seth had two determined women to stand with him as well . Married . Phillip shook his head in amused wonder . Who would have thought it ? Cam had hitched himself to the sexy social worker , and Ethan was married to sweet-eyed Grace . And had become an instant father , Phillip mused , to angel-faced Aubrey . Well , good for them . In fact , he had to admit that Anna Spinelli and Grace Monroe were tailor-made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a family when it came time for the hearing on permanent guardianship of Seth . And marriage certainly appeared to suit them . Even if the word itself gave him the willies . For himself , Phillip much preferred the single life and all its benefits . Not that he 'd had much time to avail himself of all those benefits in the past few months . Weekends in St. Chris , supervising homework assignments , pounding a hull together for the fledgling Boats by Quinn , dealing with the books for the new business , hauling groceriesall of which had somehow become his domaincramped a man 's style . He 'd promised his father on his deathbed that he would take care of Seth . With his brothers he 'd made a pact to move back to the Shore , to share the guardianship and the responsibilities . For Phillip that pact meant splitting his time between Baltimore and St. Chris , and his energies between maintaining his careerand his incomeand tending to a new and often problematic brother and a new business . It was all a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes under the best of circumstances , he imagined . Seth DeLauter , raised by a part-time hooker , full-time junkie , and amateur extortionist , had hardly come through the best of circumstances . Getting a boatbuilding enterprise off the ground was a series of irksome details and backbreaking labor . Yet somehow it was working , and if he discounted the ridiculous demands on his time and energy , it was working fairly well . Not so long ago his weekends had been spent in the company of any number of attractive , interesting women , having dinner at some new hot spot , an evening at the theater or a concert , and if the chemistry was right , a quiet Sunday brunch in bed . He 'd get back to that , Phillip promised himself . Once all the details were in place , he would have his life back again . But , as his father would have said , for the next little while ... He turned into the drive . The rain had stopped , leaving a light sheen of wet on the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the light in the living room window glowing in a soft and steady welcome . Some of the summer flowers that Anna had babied along were hanging on , and early fall blooms shimmered in the shadows . He could hear the puppy barking , though at nine months Foolish had grown too big and sleek to be considered a puppy anymore . It was Anna 's night to cook , he remembered . Thank God . It meant a real meal would be served at the Quinns ' . He rolled his shoulders , thought about pouring himself a glass of wine , then watched Foolish dash around the side of the house in pursuit of a mangy yellow tennis ball . The sight of Phillip getting out of his car obviously distracted the dog from the game . He skidded to a halt and set up a din of wild , terrified barking . " Idiot . " But he grinned as he pulled his briefcase out of the Jeep . At the familiar voice , the barking turned into mad joy . Foolish bounded up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No jumping ! " Phillip yelled , using his briefcase like a shield . " I mean it . Sit ! " Foolish quivered , but dropped his rump on the ground and lifted a paw . His tongue lolled , his eyes gleamed . " That 's a good dog . " Gingerly Phillip shook the filthy paw and scratched the dog 's silky ears . " Hey . " Seth wandered into the front yard . His jeans were grubby from wrestling with the dog , his baseball cap was askew so that straw-straight blond hair spiked out of it . The smile , Phillip noted , came much more quickly and easily than it had a few months before . But there was a gap in it . " Hey . " Phillip butted a finger on the bill of the cap . " Lose something ? " " Huh ? " Phillip tapped a finger against his own straight , white teeth . " Oh , yeah . " With a typical Quinn shrug , Seth grinned , pushing his tongue into the gap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and his eyes less wary . " It was loose . Had to give it a yank a couple of days ago . Bled like a son of a bitch . " Phillip did n't bother to sigh over Seth 's language . Some things , he determined , were n't going to be his problem . " So , did the Tooth Fairy bring you anything ? " " Get real . " " Hey , if you did n't squeeze a buck out of Cam , you 're no brother of mine . " " I got two bucks out of it . One from Cam and one from Ethan . " Laughing , Phillip swung an arm over Seth 's shoulders and headed toward the house . " Well , you 're not getting one out of me , pal . I 'm on to you . How was the first full week of school ? " " Boring . " Though it had n't been , Seth admitted silently . It had been exciting . All the new junk Anna had taken him shopping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink . He 'd refused the X-Files lunch box she 'd wanted to get him . Only a dork carried a lunch box in middle school . But it had been really cool and tough to sneer at . He had cool clothes and bitching sneakers . And best of all , for the first time in his life , he was in the same place , the same school , with the same people he 'd left behind in June . " Homework ? " Phillip asked , raising his eyebrows as he opened the front door . Seth rolled his eyes . " Man , do n't you ever think about anything else ? " " Kid , I live for homework . Especially when it 's yours . " Foolish burst through the door ahead of Phillip , nearly knocking him down with enthusiasm . " You 've still got some work to do on that dog . " But the mild annoyance faded instantly . He could smell Anna 's red sauce simmering , like ambrosia on the air . " God bless us , every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed him . " Yeah ? I 've got a Chianti I 've been saving just for this moment . " He tossed his briefcase aside . " We 'll hit the books after dinner . " He found his sister-in-law in the kitchen , filling pasta tubes with cheese . The sleeves of the crisp white shirt she 'd worn to the office were rolled up , and a white butcher 's apron covered her navy skirt . She 'd taken off her heels and tapped a bare foot to the beat of the aria she was humming . Carmen , Phillip recognized . Her wonderful mass of curling black hair was still pinned up . With a wink at Seth , Phillip came up behind her , caught her around the waist , and pressed a noisy kiss onto the top of her head . " Run away with me . We 'll change our names . You can be Sophia and I 'll be Carlo . Let me take you to paradise where you can cook for me and me alone . None of these peasants appreciate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tube , Carlo , and I 'll go pack . " She turned her head , her dark Italian eyes laughing . " Dinner in thirty minutes . " " I 'll open the wine . " " Do n't we have anything to eat now ? " Seth wanted to know . " There 's antipasto in the fridge , " she told him . " Go ahead and get it out . " " It 's just vegetables and junk , " Seth complained when he pulled out the platter . " Yep . " " Jeez . " " Wash the dog off your hands before you start on that . " " Dog spit 's cleaner than people spit , " Seth informed her . " I read how if you get bit by another guy it 's worse than getting bit by a dog . " " I 'm thrilled to have that fascinating tidbit of information . Wash the dog spit off your hands anyway . " " Man . " Disgusted , Seth clomped out , with Foolish slinking after him . Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pantry . Fine wines were one of his passions , and his palate was extremely discriminating . His apartment in Baltimore boasted an extensive and carefully chosen selection , which he kept in a closet he 'd remodeled specifically for that purpose . At the Shore , his beloved bottles of Bordeaux and Burgundy kept company with Rice Krispies and boxes of Jell-O Instant Pudding . He 'd learned to live with it . " So how was your week ? " he asked Anna . " Busy . Whoever said women can have everything should be shot , Handling a career and a family is grueling . " Then she looked up with a brilliant smile . " I 'm loving it . " " It shows . " He drew the cork expertly , sniffed it and approved , then set the bottle on the counter to breathe . " Where 's Cam ? " " Should be on his way home from the boatyard . He and Ethan wanted to put in an extra hour . The first Boat by Quinn is finished . The owner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her smile flashed , brilliant and glowing with pride . " At dock , seaworthy and just gorgeous . " He felt a little tug of disappointment that he had n't been in on the last day . " We should be having champagne . " Anna lifted a brow as she studied the label on the wine . " A bottle of Folonari , Ruffino ? " He considered one of Anna 's finest traits to be her appreciation for good wine . " Seventy-five , " he said with a broad grin . " You wo n't hear any complaints from me . Congratulations , Mr. Quinn , on your first boat . " " It 's not my deal . I just handle the details and pass for slave labor . " " Of course it 's your deal . Details are necessary , and neither Cam nor Ethan could handle them with the finesse you do . " " I think the word they use , is nagging . ' " " They need to be nagged . You should be proud of what the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not just the new business , but the family . Each one of you has given up something that 's important to you for Seth . And each one of you has gotten something important back . " " I never expected the kid to matter so much . " While Anna smothered the filled tubes with sauce , Phillip opened a cupboard for wineglasses . " I still have moments when the whole thing pisses me off . " " That 's only natural , Phillip . " " Does n't make me feel any better about it . " He shrugged his shoulders in dismissal , then poured two glasses . " But most of the time , I look at him and think he 's a pretty good deal for a kid brother . " Anna grated cheese over the casserole . Out of the corner of her eye she watched Phillip lift his glass , appreciate the bouquet . He was beautiful to look at , she mused . Physically , he was as close to male perfection as she could imagine . Bronze hair , thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was long , narrow , thoughtful . Both sensual and angelic . His tall , trim build seemed to have been fashioned for Italian suits . But since she 'd seen him stripped to the waist in faded Levi 's she knew there was nothing soft about him . Sophisticated , tough , erudite , shrewd . An interesting man , she mused . She slipped the casserole into the oven , then turned to pick up her wine . Smiling at him , she tapped her glass on his . " You 're a pretty good deal too , Phillip , for a big brother . " She leaned in to kiss him lightly as Cam walked in . " Get your mouth off my wife . " Phillip merely smiled and slid an arm around Anna 's waist . " She put hers on me . She likes me . " " She likes me better . " To prove it , Cam hooked a hand in the tie of Anna 's apron , spun her around , and pulled her into his arms to kiss her brainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her butt companionably . " Don'cha , sugar ? " Her head was still spinning . " Probably . " She blew out a breath . " All things considered . " But she wiggled free . " You 're filthy . " " Just came in to grab a beer to take into the shower . " Long and lean , dark and dangerous , he prowled over to the fridge . " And kiss my wife , " he added with a smug look at Phillip . " Go get your own woman . " " Who has time ? " Phillip said mournfully . * * * After dinner , and an hour spent slaving over long division , battles of the Revolutionary War , and sixth-grade vocabulary , Phillip settled down in his room with his laptop and his files . It was the same room he 'd been given when Ray and Stella Quinn had brought him home . The walls had been a pale green then . Sometime during his sixteenth year he 'd gotten a wild hair and painted them magenta . God knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother by thenhad taken one look and warned him he 'd have terminal indigestion . He thought it was sexy . For about three months . Then he'd. gone with a stark white for a while , accented with moody black-framed , black-and-white , photographs . Always looking for ambience , Phillip thought now , amused at himself . He 'd circled back to that soft green right before he moved to Baltimore . They 'd been right all along , he supposed . His parents had usually been right . They 'd given him this room , in this house , in this place . He had n't made it easy for them . The first three months were a battle of wills . He smuggled in drugs , picked fights , stole liquor , and stumbled in drunk at dawn . It was clear to him now that he 'd been testing them , daring them to kick him out , Toss him back . Go ahead , he 'd thought . You ca n't handle me . But they did . They had not only handled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father had said , why you want to waste a good mind and a good body . Why you want to let the bastards win . Phillip , who was suffering from the raw gut and bursting head of a drag and alcohol hangover , did n't give a good damn . Ray took him out on the boat , telling him that a good sail would clear his head . Sick as a dog , Phillip leaned over the rail , throwing up the remnants of the poisons he 'd pumped into his system the night before . He 'd just turned fourteen . Ray anchored the boat in a narrow gut . He held Phillip 's head , wiped his face , then offered him a cold can of ginger ale . " Sit down . " He did n't so much sit as collapse . His hands shook , his stomach shuddered at the first sip from the can . Ray sat across from him , his big hands on his knees , his silvering hair flowing in the light breeze . And those eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had a couple of months now to get your bearings around here . Stella says you 've come around physically . You 're strong , and healthy enoughthough you are n't going to stay that way if you keep this up . " He pursed his lips , said nothing for a long moment . There was a heron in the tall grass , still as a painting . The air was bright and chill with late fall , the trees bare of leaves so that the hard blue sky spread overhead . Wind ruffled the grass and skimmed fingers over the water . The man sat , apparently content with the silence and the scene . The boy slouched , pale of face and hard of eye . " We can play this a lot of ways , Phil , " Ray said at length . " We can be hard-asses . We can put you on a short leash , watch you every minute and bust your balls every time you screw up . Which is most of the time . " Considering , Ray picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or we could all just say that this little experiment 's a bust and you can go back into the system . " Phillip 's stomach churned , making him swallow to hold down what he did n't quite recognize as fear . " I do n't need you . I do n't need anybody . " " Yeah , you do . " Ray said it mildly as he dropped the line into the water . Ripples spread , endlessly . " You go back into the system , you 'll stay there . Couple of years down the road , it wo n't be juvie anymore . You 'll end up in a cell with the bad guys , the kind of guys who are going to take a real liking to that pretty face of yours . Some seven-foot con with hands like smoked hams is going to grab you in the showers one fine day and make you his bride . " Phillip yearned desperately for a cigarette . The image conjured by Ray 's word made fresh sweat pop out on his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son , they 'll pass you around like canaps , and you know it . You talk a good game and you fight a good fight , but some things are inevitable . Up to this point your life has pretty much sucked . You 're not responsible for that . But you are responsible for What happens from here on . " He fell into silence again , clamping the pole between his knees before reaching for a cold can of Pepsi . Taking his time , Ray popped the top , tipped the can back , and guzzled . " Stella and I thought we saw something in you , " he continued . " We still do , " he added , looking at Phillip again . " But until you do , we 're not going to get anywhere . " " What do you care ? " Phillip tossed back miserably . " Hard to say at the moment . Maybe you 're not worth it . Maybe you 'll just end up back on the streets hustling marks and turning tricks anyway . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , and all the books he could readone of his secret lovesat his disposal . At the thought of losing it his throat filled again , but he only shrugged . " I 'll get by . " " If all you want to do is get by , that 's your choice . Here you can have a home , a family . You can have a life and make something out of it . Or you can go on the way you are . " Ray reached over to Phillip quickly , and the boy braced himself for the blow , clenched his fists to return it . But Ray only pulled Phillip 's shirt up to expose the livid scars on his chest . " You can go back to that , " he said quietly . Phillip looked into Ray 's eyes . He saw compassion and hope . And he saw himself mirrored back , bleeding in a dirty gutter on a street where life was worth less than a dime bag . Sick , tired , terrified , Phillip dropped his head into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the point , son . " Ray ran his hand over Phillip 's hair . " You 're the point . " Things had n't changed overnight , Phillip thought now . But they had begun to change . His parents had made him believe in himself , despite himself . It had become a point of pride for him to do well in school , to learn , to remake himself into Phillip Quinn . He figured he 'd done a good job of it . He 'd coated that street kid with a sheen of class . He had a slick career , a well-appointed condo with a killer view of the Inner Harbor , and a wardrobe that suited both . It seemed that he 'd come full circle , spending his weekends back in this room with its green walls and sturdy furniture , with its windows that overlooked the trees and the marsh . But this time , Seth was the point .
