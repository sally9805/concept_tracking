NASA 'S NEW ORIGINS PROGRAM PLACES A PREMIUM ON the search for other solar systems , particularly those that harbor planets like our Earth . The space agency 's approach centers on instruments that will scan the stars from outer space ( May issue , page 26 ) . While free from atmospheric interference , such tools are expensive and pose numerous technical challenges . But science may not have to wait for them to fly . Two research groups believe they will soon be able to locate Earthlike planets with modest ground-based telescopes . One team , led by Hans J. Deeg ( Institute of Astrophysics of the Canaries , Spain ) and Laurance R. Doyle ( SETI Institute ) , focuses on eclipsing binary systems , in which two stars orbit one another in a plane that we happen to see edge on . Deeg and Doyle assume that any planets orbiting such a system probably lie in that plane too . If so , the planets should produce minor eclipses of their own as they cross our sightlines to the stars . The team 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly identical red-dwarf stars that circle one another every 1.27 days . Because these typeM constituents are only one-fourth as large as our Sun , the transit of an Earth-size planet would be expected to diminish their combined brightness by a minuscule but measurable 0.07 percent . As the astronomers will explain in an upcoming issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics , their five-year photometric database already contains six " suspicious " dimmings that could conceivably be due to planets roughly twice the size of Earth . However , Doyle cautions that these hardly prove a planet 's existence ; to do so , the eclipses must recur in a well-defined manner . ( Otherwise , starspots or instrumental flukes may be at play . ) But " we 've proved our point , " he continues ; by obtaining a large quantity of precise photometric data , " you can detect Earth-size planets from the ground . " Doyle is now turning his attention - and the telescopes of Chile 's Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory - to a new sample of more than 100 eclipsing binaries . The other would-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Naval Observatory ) , hope to exploit the wavelike nature of light to search for extrasolar planets . Their approach ? As a star circles the center of mass that it shares with another body , its light waves are periodically red- and blueshifted . The effect is extremely slight ; seen from afar , the wavelengths of our Sun 's spectral lines would change by only four parts in a hundred million as a result of Jupiter 's orbit .

But spectral shifts would have to be measured at the parts-per- billion level or better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordgren 's multichannel Fourier Transform Spectrometer ( mTFS ) . A modern-day version of the interferometer that Albert A. Michelson designed and built a century ago , the mTFS splits a star 's light and sends one beam along a mirrored path . It then mixes the two beams anew , producing a set of interference fringes . The star 's spectrum is measured by moving the mirrors and recording changes in the interference pattern . Earlier this year Hajian and Nordgren pieced together an mTFS using parts from the Naval Prototype Optical Interferometer on Arizona 's Anderson Mesa . With this apparatus they recorded the spectra of Betelgeuse and Procyon . These spectra lacked the sensitivity and resolution required to look for Earth-mass planets , Hajian readily admits . But he asserts that with a few hundred thousand dollars ' worth of improvements , " you can detect an Earth " around a Sun-like star with an mFTS and a 3-meter telescope . For the immediate future , Hajian and Nordgren have set themselves a more modest goal - " rediscovering " the already known " extrasolar Jupiters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrometer for deployment on the world 's largest reflectors . They then will have to prove that Doppler shifts from Earth-like planets can be distinguished from unrelated wavelike motions in the the target stars ' photospheres . <p>
