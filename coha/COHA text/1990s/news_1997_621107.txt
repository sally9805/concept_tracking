<p> ' BART CONTRACT WO N'T CAUSE FARE INCREASE ' <p> Editor  --  Matier and Ross got it wrong in Monday 's column ( Chronicle , September 15 ) when they implied that the BART labor settlement would require a fare increase . Matier and Ross may be good political analysts , but they are lousy financial analysts . <p> Your reporters Bowman and Del Vecchio got it exactly right in their news article in Monday 's Chronicle . As reported in that story , BART defined a three-year offer that did not put unmanageable pressure on BART 's budget . That offer was a three-year contract with three annual 3 percent raises . The four-year agreement reached Saturday morning " Proportionally . . . costs about the same . . . but gave both sides the flexibility they needed " to reach agreement and end the strike as reported in Monday 's Chronicle news story . <p> BART 's 10-year financial forecast is just that , a forecast . It makes assumptions about what expenses will be over those 10 years ( including increases in wages ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer  --  before contract negotiations , forecasts a financial gap three and four years from now . That gap is approximately $ 14 million to $ 16 million . It is only marginally impacted by this settlement . Therefore , this settlement does not drive any future fare increase decision . BART 's annual budget this year is $ 286 million . About 73 percent of our budget every year goes to pay the cost of labor  --  salaries and benefits for all BART employees . The additional cost of BART 's final offer or the agreement reached Saturday morning does not alter our financial outlook in any meaningful way . <p> From the beginning , the BART board said it could not and would not agree to labor contracts that put additional pressure on our customers or Bay Area taxpayers through fare increases or service reductions . And the BART board has kept that promise . <p> THOMAS E.

Who 's going to start doing something about it ? <p> KAREN WEISEL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> DIANA , PRINCESS OF WALES <p> Editor  --  May I use your columns to thank the thousands and thousands of people from throughout the Bay Area , and beyond , who have mourned with us the death of Diana , Princess of Wales . We have been deeply touched by their response to her tragic and untimely departure . <p> Many messages of condolence , the floral and other tributes which we have received , and the sentiments expressed by those who came personally to the consulate general to pay their respects or to sign the Books of Con dolence , all testify to the deep affection in which the princess was held . <p> It is a great comfort that our grief is so widely shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for your extensive and sympathetic coverage of the princess 's death and funeral and of the world 's heartfelt reaction to it . <p> We are very grateful for all the support we have received . <p> MALCOLM DOUGAL <p> HM Consul General <p> British Consulate-General <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BOATS AND MTBE <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle 's September 15 story , " Gas Additives ' Needless Risk , " neglects the most ignored source of MTBEs in our water supply  --  two-stroke motors used in all jet skis and most outboard motors used in boats . According to the EPA , up to 30 percent of all gasoline and oil used in these craft is emitted unburned into the water , resulting in 15 Exxon Valdez spills worth of petrochemicals every year in the United States ! <p> Ten million boats with two- stroke motors are dumping an average of 15 gallons each , for a total of 150 million gallons of fuel into our nation 's waterways . In California , the second largest boating state in the U.S. , this amounts to 825,000 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water reservoirs such as Lake Tahoe . <p> If we truly want to protect our citizens ' health from the dangers of MTBE and other such carcinogens , we should ban not only MTBE but the use of two-stroke motors on our reservoirs , since clean burning four-stroke motors are now readily available . <p> RUSSELL LONG <p> Director  --  Bluewater Network , <p> Earth Island Institute <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CASSINI SPACE PROBE <p> Editor  --  Deadly radioactive fallout from above-ground nuclear tests sprinkled across most of the U.S. in the 1950s . Our children were nurtured on milk laced with strontium 90 . Now , 40 years later , the media reveal a long-concealed study showing the damage was worse than first imagined . No county escaped this toxic dusting and those born in the ' 50s are being advised to have their thyroids checked for cancer . <p> I marched , protested , demonstrated and lobbied alongside others from the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom for an end to the nuclear tests . Our voices seldom , if ever , were allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even greater peril which the media , once again , are blocking out ! On October 6 , NASA is launching the Cassini Space Probe containing 72.3 pounds of plutonium . If something should go wrong with lift off or if the space ship should enter Earth 's atmosphere on its fly- by to Saturn after being sling shot around Venus , the scattering of so much plutonium could cause lung cancer for most human beings on our planet . <p> I hope millions will be with us as we march again to stop this insanity . <p> KAREN TALBOT <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> END RENT CONTROL IN S.F. <p> Editor  --  Arlene Silverman 's Open Forum article about good tenants not being stable ones is a breath of fresh air . San Francisco 's rent control law has created a twisted marketplace for rental housing , to the detriment of the majority of renters and owners alike . <p> Until San Francisco has the guts to admit that this holy cow we call rent control does not work , and end it , rental housing in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive and occupied by transient and short-term tenants rather than stable long-term renters . <p> Boston abolished rent control , and the sky did n't fall in ! Unless we want to go the way of permanent housing crisis as normal like New York , we had better end this experiment in rent control and follow Boston 's lead ! <p> ANDREW LONG <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THOUGHTS AT A RALLY <p> Editor  --  Sunday , Stafford , Headwaters rally in Humboldt County , police everywhere , by the hundreds . They came from all over the state , blocking exits for hours , at time and a half , in riot gear . No violence at the rallies of the two previous years , no violence expected this year . Humboldt County has no money for homeless or anything else , for that matter . How do the Board of Supervisors justify this expense ? Could it be that their real agenda was to make the rally-goers look like they are responsible for depleting county coffers with their dreadful , irresponsible environmentalism ? <p> The California Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads to tell us how wrong environmentalists are . Oddly , this is the same CDF that recently told us that due to budget cuts they will not be able to adequately fight fires . The Governor Wilson-appointed head of the CDF tells us that salvage logging is important to the health of our forests and helps prevent forest fires . He seems not to have read the studies that make it clear that this is not true . <p> Are our politicians all wholly owned subsidiaries of the timber companies ? <p> SYLVIA DE ROOY <p> Westhaven
