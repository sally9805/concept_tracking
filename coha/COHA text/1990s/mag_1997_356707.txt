Nora Okja Keller used to think real writers looked like Ernest Hemingway . Gruff , bearded , white , male . She was none of those . She was an immigrant , born in Seoul to a Korean mother and a white American father , and raised in Hawaii . But Keller 's image of herself started to change in 1993 , when she went to a symposium on human rights at the University of Hawaii at Manoa ; there she heard an elderly Korean woman tell her true story of being a " comfort woman " during World War II , when she was one of the many foreigners forced by the Japanese into prostitution camps that serviced their soldiers . The story haunted Keller . Who would pass it on ? Who would write it down ? The old woman came to her in nightmares . " Finally , I got up in the middle of the night and started to write down my dreams , " says Keller . Those notes became a book . And she became a writer . <P> Keller 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is one of a trio of powerful debut novels by Asian-American women to arrive in bookstores lately . The others : Monkey King ( HarperCollins ; 310 pages ; $24 ) by Patricia Chao ( of Chinese and Japanese descent ) and The Necessary Hunger ( Simon &; Schuster ; 365 pages ; $23 ) by Nina Revoyr ( whose mother and father are Japanese and Polish-American , respectively ) . Although these books share some themes  --  all of them deal with parents and children in conflict over such issues as cultural and sexual identity  --  each author has a sharp , specific vision . <P> Keller 's story is the most harrowing . The book , narrated in the alternating voices of a Korean comfort woman named Akiko and her Korean-American daughter Beccah , delivers a wrenching view of war and its lasting intergenerational impact . Akiko , driven half-mad by the war , is haunted by the ghost of a woman from the camp and becomes a sought-after mystic after moving to America . But to call this a ghost story is to miss the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that haunts and is handed down , like old , sad clothes . Writes Akiko : " I knew what it felt like to stretch open for many men ... about pain sharp enough to cut your body from your mind . " Although Keller 's prose , at a few points , has more ambition than lyricism , overall this is a sturdy , eloquent book . <P> Keller says her own mother was not a comfort woman , but served as an inspiration . " My mom did n't really speak Korean to me , " says Keller . " She was so conscious of her own difference that she did n't want me to learn Korean and make me something different , ' the other ' ... I know I went through a period of feeling really embarrassed and alienated from things that were Korean . So I write now , in part , to go back to that Korean perspective and try to reclaim what I denied for so long . " <P> Chao 's intermittently witty and highly readable Monkey King also deals with mental illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally Wang , is a Chinese-American woman who has just suffered a mental breakdown . The book 's power comes not from some wild psychological portrait of a mind in turmoil but from its careful detailing of Sally 's life at the mental institution in which she attempts a recovery . Sally 's family history is also nuanced and believable ; small observations add up . Recalling her childhood , Sally says , " Because my parents had not been prepared for a girl , I had no name for the first two months of my life . "
