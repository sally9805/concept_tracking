One was a sybarite who virtually abandoned his desert kingdom for a career of overseas carousing . He drank Scotch freely , ordered caviar by the pound , attended the raunchy shows in the nightclubs of Beirut so frequently that he knew all the leading belly dancers by name , engaged in myriad liaisons with women ( he is said to have paid the wife of a Lebanese businessman $100,000 a year to make herself available ) and , if old stories are to be believed , gambled away $1 million in the casinos of Monte Carlo during a single weekend . <P> The other is a King known for caution bordering on indecision and endless consultations before taking any action . His fiscal prudence is so extreme that he once became tearful on television while confessing that he could not balance his country 's budget . He has for years conducted an exquisite balancing act among factions in his royal family , between the West and the Arab world , between the tug toward high-tech modernization and the impulse to preserve the semifeudal culture of his kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fahd ibn Abdul Aziz , King of Saudi Arabia and Custodian ( of the holy places of Mecca and Medina ) , a form of address he prefers to Your Majesty . And the difference between the profligate prince and the cautious King reflects something more than the aging of the young hell raiser into a 69-year-old monarch whose 275-lb. bulk has so weakened his knees that he has trouble walking . Some 37 years ago , Fahd went through a conversion that , though forced on him , has had a lasting effect . <P> In 1953 the ascetic Crown Prince ( later King ) Faisal summoned his younger half-brother Fahd and told him he was disgracing himself and the kingdom . It was time , said Faisal , for Fahd to come home and devote himself to serious matters of state . Implicit in the rebuke was a warning that Fahd was endangering his chances of succeeding to the crown . As one of seven sons borne by the favorite wife of the legendary Abdul Aziz ( generally known as Ibn Saud ) , who created Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King . But there was , and is , nothing automatic about the succession ; like almost every other major decision in Saudi Arabia , it reflects a consensus of the royal family . <P> Spurred by shame and ambition , Fahd tamed his playboy ways and became Minister of Education just as the oil money was beginning to pour in . Though his formal education had been confined to a few years at a kuttab ( Koranic school ) , Fahd built schools by the hundreds and several universities . He later served as Interior Minister , and in 1975 , when King Faisal was assassinated and succeeded by another brother , Khalid , Fahd became Crown Prince . Khalid , troubled by a weak heart , paid little attention to affairs of state ; Fahd in effect ran the country for years before he succeeded to the throne on Khalid 's death in 1982.
