Section : World report How a mighty space program has fallen <p> Dateline : Moscow <p> The launch , at least , was perfect . " Yest start , " the Russian announcer said  --  " We have liftoff . " Then , as the unmanned Mars ' 96 probe hurtled into space from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on a clear night , its fiery tail knifing through the dark sky , he added , " All systems are functioning normally . " <p> But just two hours later , top Russian space officials were suddenly calledaway from a vodka- and cognac-laden celebratory banquet . A misfiring fourth-stage booster rocket had failed to lift the craft out of Earth orbit . The charred remains went crashing into the Pacific , and with them went probably the last hopes that Russia 's ailing space program can ever recover its former glory . <p> Mars ' 96 was Moscow 's most ambitious space probe of the decade . Seven years in the making , the 6-ton , $300 million spacecraft carried scientific equipment from 20 nations  --  and post-Communist Russia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been a scientific first , the probe was to have deployed mechanical penetrators to drill 16 feet below the planet 's surface looking for minerals , water and signs of life . Instead , Russia now faces the prospect of playing at most a supporting role in space into the next century . <p> American and other space missions have failed before , of course . But none so predictably . Funding for Russia 's space program is only 20 percent of the $2.9 billion it was in 1989 . James Oberg , a U.S. expert on Russia 's space effort , had long predicted such strains would produce a crash , noting before the November 16 launch that Mars ' 96 was " strikingly ambitious , even for a healthy space program . " <p> Fallout . " It has hit the whole space program hard , " admitted Yuri Milov , deputy director of the Russian Space Agency . Russia 's funding shortfalls , equipment failures and loss of technical staff are having consequences for the U.S. space program , too . Many of the National Aeronautics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  programs such as the International Space Station and scientific exploration of Mars hinge on Russian cooperation ( box , Page 46 ) . <p> Russia 's former top-secret installations are now open to view , warts and all , and some of them are doozies . When septic tanks aboard the space station Mir overflowed last month , ground controllers studied the problem and ordered cosmonauts to empty the contents of the tank into space using an auxiliary pump . The cosmonauts spent a week searching the spacecraft for the pump and finally gave up . Relief came only last Friday , when a supply rocket docked with the station . <p> At Star City , the cosmonaut training center outside Moscow , unlighted corridors , unmowed lawns and paint peeling from office walls testify to budget cuts . Trash litters once pristine birch and pine groves . The flight simulator used to train for launch and docking procedures is 10 years old . So is the water tank for weightlessness training . Indeed , Star City is so desperate to raise cash just to keep going that it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience weightlessness training at $1,000 a pop . <p> Jerry Linenger , an American astronaut who has been at Star City for over a year , says the training equipment is comparable to that of the U.S. Mercury program of the 1960s . Russian space training also retains the old mania about secrecy from Soviet days , Linenger says , with little written down . Instead of learning from diagrams and manuals , trainees go one on one with an instructor " who keeps repeating until you get it . " <p> Oberg has described an " institutional amnesia " creeping into the program as a result ; in one incident last year , he says , cosmonauts aboard Mir showed ground controllers some pieces of hardware over the TV monitor and asked if anyone knew what they were or what they were for . No one did . <p> Even the once untouchable military space program is suffering . Russia 's last remaining spy satellite fell from orbit in late September , leaving Russia with no eyes in the sky for the first time since the early 1960s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian official , are beyond their five-to-seven-year lifetimes . <p> Russian space officials often say their program could collapse in bankruptcy unless they get proper funding . The $200 million in added cash that Boris Yeltsin promised the Russian Space Agency in April has still not materialized . But talk of bankruptcy is hyperbole , if for no other reason than that Russia 's commercial space ventures remain a bright spot . <p> The Russians make good , cheap and dependable boosters . ( The Mars probe failure occurred after the fourth stage had separated from the Proton rocket , which worked flawlessly . ) Their only problem is that they do n't have a clue how to market them . So they 've teamed up with two American aerospace giants , Lockheed Martin and Boeing , which are peddling launch services to companies like Hughes that need to get their communications satellites into orbit . Firm orders for 35 launches are in hand . <p> At the Khrunichev rocket factory in Moscow , there is no identifying name at the front gate , a holdover from Soviet days when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of two football fields , the lead production item is now Proton rockets for commercial launches . For now , the Khrunichev plant 's future is ensured with over $500 million in commercial orders for the next four years . <p> At mission control in Kaliningrad , just outside Moscow , it 's also funding from the West that helps make up the difference . A huge statue of Lenin stands in the lobby of the building , covered daily with fresh flowers by staffers who remain nostalgic for the prestige and government largess they enjoyed in Communist days . But on the second floor is a copy of NASA 's Houston mission control room , complete with Hewlett-Packard computers that track the orbiting Mir satellite . As long as an American astronaut is on Mir , U.S. specialists will staff the facility . <p> Classic stuff . Mars ' 96 is the classic example so far of the disasters Russia 's overly ambitious but underfunded space program can produce . Originally called Mars ' 94 , the delayed mission was facing cancellation this spring . Vladimir Utkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Yeltsin last March and told him that to drop the project would be " a loss of technical face and political face as well . " The president promised the last overdue cash payment , but it arrived only in the final weeks before the launch , and only after Utkin had appealed directly to Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin . <p> According to unconfirmed Russian press reports , the last-minute rush to meet the launch schedule was so chaotic that ballistics experts refused to sign documents that all was ready . Among the reported mistakes , inadequately trained workers mixed up plus and minus battery terminals , burning delicate sensors that had taken a decade to develop . <p> Other botches are likely to be revealed in the official inquiry into the crash , due to be finished December 5 . International space experts are expecting an unconventionally candid report from the Russians , who know that their credibility with foreign customers  --  their most promising source of income these days  --  is on the line . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Nice try . A perfect launch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to failure . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cash and carry . The sale of Proton rockets to launch Western satellites is keeping the Khrunichev factory afloat . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mission control . Tracking Mir in Kaliningrad <p> By Fred Coleman <p> AMERICAN EGGS IN A RUSSIAN BASKET Space station <p> If misery loves company , the Russians at least had reason to feel consoled last week : Twenty nations lost millions of dollars of scientific instruments that were being carried aboard the Mars ' 96 space probe . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent along an $11 million experiment to investigate the soil chemistry of Mars , crucial information for designing future U.S. probes that will search for evidence of life on the planet . <p> The world 's scientific community can recover from the loss of a single satellite , but much more is riding on participation by the Russians in the U.S.-led International Space Station . Cooperation between the former rivals in space has been a cornerstone of NASA 's strategy to keep such big space ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's space woes have already thrown the station 's intricately coordinated construction schedule into disarray . The vital service module , scheduled for launch on a Russian Proton booster in April 1998 , is now five months behind schedule and expected to slip further . The module is a crucial link in the whole project , providing a place for crews to live during construction , and it must be in place before the rest of the station can beassembled . <p> Selling point . There is a rich irony in the situation , since Russian participation was originally a decisive selling point of the $30 billion project , which Congress had balked at . The Russians promised to bring their expertise in operating space stations like Mir , as well as a significant financial contribution . <p> The current plan calls for Russia not only to build several key components but also to provide 44 of the 72 total launches required to build the station  --  including three of the first four . The first launch is to carry the Russian-built functional cargo block ( FGB , in its Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide power , attitude control and fuel storage . <p> The FGB happens to be right on schedule  --  not coincidentally because the work is being funded directly by the United States , paid for with $200 million in hard cash under a contract between the Khrunichev rocket factory and Boeing , the space station manager . <p> Khrunichev is also building the service module in the same plant . But money for it is supposed to come out of the Russian state budget  --  and it has n't . Unpaid workers have laid down their hammers . Randy Brinkley , the U.S. station manager , was in Moscow last week trying to get work resumed . One possibility is for NASA to make advance payments on the $400 million rent it is paying to use Mir so that American astronauts can learn how to live in space . Khrunichev could use the cash to make up for lost time by running three shifts a day . The service module might also be put in orbit without all its necessary systems installed ; they would have to be added later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service module could cost the United States an extra $1 billion to $2 billion to produce an American equivalent and delay the space station project by a year or two . One candidate would be a new design that utilized portions of the secret KH-11 spy satellite . The reconnaissance satellite has maneuvering capabilities that are similar to the service module 's . <p> But that would be a last resort . NASA 's aim is to get the Russians ' program back on track . Otherwise , the whole rationale for including them in the first place could fail . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jigsaw puzzle .
