One of the many charms of the electro-rock band Garbage is the group 's expectations-lowering name . After all , if you buy a ticket to a movie called Big-Budget Bomb or vote for , say , a gubernatorial candidate named Mr. Lecherous Promise-Breaker , you 've got no one to blame but yourself if things turn out bad . <P> Happily , Garbage 's sophomore album , Version 2.0 ( Almo Sounds ) does n't live up  --  or down  --  to the band 's name . The quartet , based in Madison , Wis. , and consisting of singer Shirley Manson ( originally from Edinburgh , Scotland ) , guitarists Steve Marker and Duke Erikson , and drummer Butch Vig ( who produced Nirvana 's album Nevermind ) , had never played outside the studio before recording their debut album , Garbage , in 1995 . Their inexperience showed : while the album had its moments , it often felt indecisive and inorganic . In the past three years , Garbage has had a chance to tour , and now it sounds more like a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marker and Erikson had played together and separately in a number of small , Wisconsin-area bands . One night they saw Manson on MTV fronting another band , called Angelfish . They tracked her down , asked her to join their nascent group , and Garbage was launched . " Madison is isolated , so we 're kind of removed from the music business or the distractions you may have in New York , Los Angeles , London or Paris , " says Vig . " It 's a great city , but there 's not much to do , so everyone kind of leaves us to our own devices . " <P> Version 2.0 boasts a unique , expansive sound that fills the speakers and the ears . The songs are hormonal yet thoughtful , mostly morose but always energetically so . Dreamy , cooing verses give way to booming choruses driven by electronic percussion . On one of the album 's best songs , the jittery , upbeat Special , Manson seems to channel the spirit of Pretenders ' lead singer Chrissie Hynde : " You were the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's closing moments , a reference to one of the Pretenders ' hits . Indeed , Manson called Hynde up to ask her permission for the vocal homage . Says Manson : " A fax came through the machine saying , ' I , Chrissie Hynde , do solemnly swear that the rock band Garbage can sample my sound , my voice or indeed my very a . ' " When an established rocker is willing to give so generously to a new band , it 's an indication of the group 's promise . <P> Manson is another one of Garbage 's central charms . She has a warm , sensuous voice and a charismatic personality that comes through in her songs : angry but needy , wounded but enduring , a little jaded but somehow guileless . She 's clearly a rock star in the making . <P> Version 2.0 is not without faults : some of the melodies are weak , and the production is , at times , overbearing . Still , the band is headed in the right direction . " We 're very aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Manson . " The industry does n't want to encourage fan loyalty over the long term , they just want a quick hit . " That is n't always the rule , of course : the Dave Matthews Band 's uneven new CD , Before These Crowded Streets , just debuted atop the Billboard charts , helped by a loyal fan following established through constant , Grateful Dead-like touring . It would be fascinating to see Garbage also buck the trend toward planned pop obsolescence and develop some of their intriguing , still coalescing , musical ideas .
