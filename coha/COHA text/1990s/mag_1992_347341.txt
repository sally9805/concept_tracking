FINDING A SINGLE GENE AMONG THE ESTIMATED 100,000 genes scattered along the 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells is every bit as daunting as finding the proverbial needle in a haystack . But now the quest has been made simpler , at least for two of those chromosomes . As reported in the research journal Nature , investigators in Paris have published the first map to describe in the correct order all the most important subsections of the 21st chromosome  --  the one that harbors genes associated with Down syndrome , Alzheimer 's disease and other neurological disorders . Simultaneously , researchers in Boston published a similar map , in Science , for the Y chromosome , which is vital to male development . <P> These achievements will help researchers decipher the genetic blueprint of human beings . They will not , however , by themselves lead to useful therapies anytime in the near future . Because of the complicated interplay between heredity and environment , knowing where a gene is located and what it looks like is only a first step .
