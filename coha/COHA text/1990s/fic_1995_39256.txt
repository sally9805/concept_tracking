They grew up playing hockey on Everett Pond , long after supper , after homework and Bonanza or Laugh-In or My Three Sons , after they said good night and went to their rooms yawning as if headed to sleep . The grown-ups pretended not to know about the rendezvous at the rink , but some of the fathers had , as boys , given birth to the midnight game , a raucous winter lullaby for the far end of the street . <p> Allie Sprinkle was one of five or six girls who listened for their parents to fall quiet behind their bedroom doors before they padded downstairs in their nighties , tucked hems into leggings , pulled on boots and big jackets and mittens but left their hats behind , and went out to the cold where their friends were waiting . They gathered at the top of King 's Hill and locked arms for the descent on snow to the edge of the pond , where there was an extra goal box turned over for them to sit on . <p> When they saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could settle . They paused to lean on their sticks , glad for the excuse to catch up on their breathing , then resumed darting and slapping with a louder , sharper energy because they were being watched . The game was dottily lighted by the moon and stars , and by four bulbs strung on a parade of extension cords around the rink . The girls clapped their mittens together and gave soft shouts of " Way to go , Burkie , " and " Guard that goal ! " When someone scored , a cheer rose from the players and their crowd , and Allie turned her face straight up to the black sky , closing her eyes , tasting a love and safety she knew would never be duplicated , that certainty a sweet stab in her heart . <p> The winter most of them were twelve , the season came to an end without warning on a crinkly December night . Nicole Rueger was sitting on the goal bench , next to Allie , coughing into her gloves , when Gerald Burke hit the puck with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her cheek . <p> There was a moment during which they all lost time  --  they knew the puck was flying somewhere , but they could n't see it  --  and then Allie felt the cold whish of it by her face . She turned her head to follow the puck and watched Nicole fall from the bench beside her , headfirst into the hard bank , making a cracking sound as she landed . The boys skated over and stood in a bigger circle behind the one the girls formed around Nicole . <p> " Get her up , " Gerald Burke said . He was wobbling on his blades . <p> Allie bent over to touch Nicole . There was no blood , but they all knew she was knocked out . <p> " Do n't move her said Michael Usiak , whose father drove an ambulance for Memorial . <p> " Well , what are we supposed to do ? " <p> " I say we carry her up the hill . She 'll probably wake up by the time we get there . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unfastening his skates , and the laces flashed in the moonlight . He began to run up the hill in his sock feet . " I 'll get my dad , " he told them , tripping as he turned to call over his shoulder . " Somebody take off their jacket and cover her up . " <p> It was so cold they shivered just listening to his words . They all knew he was right , but not one of them , facing the wind , could imagine undressing in it . <p> " It was Gerald who hit her , " Dickie Domermuth said after the silence . " He should be the one Even as Dickie spoke , Gerald was unzipping his jacket , flinging his body out of it like a wrestler escaping a hold . He stuck the toe of his blade into the bank to stay steady as he lowered the jacket across Nicole . He went to take off his sweater , too , but Dickie caught his arm and said , " That 's enough For a moment the wind stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then came the sound of grown-ups running , out of the houses and down the slick hill . It was more than just Michael and his father ; most of the other parents came , too . Allie could see her mother 's nightie flapping under her coat , and her father 's robe belt dragging across snow . It looked like a scattered army dosing in for the kill . <p> " I did n't mean it Gerald confessed to them , as he fell on his knees to the ground . <p> It turned out that Nicole had a concussion , which sent her to the hospital through the rest of the night and then gave her headaches for the next sixteen years , until she had her first child , when the pain seemed to leak out of her with the milk After she and Gerald were married , she never mentioned the headaches to him in private , but if they had guests over and there was a light-hearted feel to the room , she sometimes went into a little routine to recreate what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal bench , next to Allie Sprinkle the nerd , " she began , tapping a salt shaker against the tablecloth to place her listeners at the scene . " It was one of those frosty nights where you can feel your nose hairs , and all of a sudden this puck comes whizzing through the air . " <p> At this point Nicole usually chose the wine cork to simulate the puck 's route . She aimed it at the salt shaker and let fly . Even when she hit the mark , there was n't enough weight to push the shaker over , so she flicked at it with her fingernail , and salt scattered across the cloth . The guests laughed at this unlikely representation of Nicole knocked flat in the snow , but anyone who looked carefully through the candlelight could see Gerald wincing behind his smile . Someone always asked how the two of them ended up together , after that , but Gerald and Nicole always said they had no idea . <p> Usually , it was the accident itself that caught the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some people from Gerald 's office over for crab cakes and beer , one of the men said , " Allie Sprinkle . That sounds familiar . Would I know that name ? " <p> " I do n't see how , " Nicole said , twirling her wineglass by the stem in a circle beside her plate . " This was a little town called Oxbow , up near Buffalo . By a butchery . They had the best barbecued wings you could ask for , but the air smelled like blood . " <p> " Do you ever get back there ? " someone asked . <p> " Not if we can help it : ' Nicole said . " Gerald 's parents are dead , and we make mine fly if they want to see us She was looking deep into her glass . Then she gave one of her famous smiles , as if to indicate she was only kidding , and swiveled in her chair to face Gerald . Ever since the headaches had left her , she found she could n't resist making sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and asked her why , but she said she did n't know . She knew she would never have the courage to tell him she missed the pain he had given her , if this turned out to be the truth . <p> Nicole looked around the room at her guests , at their confident and capable faces ; at the solid and pretty furniture she owned , and the silver tableware ; at the ceiling above which her sleeping children dreamed of things they had yet to learn would never happen on this unmagical earth . She felt filled and blessed , and knew she should wonder what she had done to deserve any of it . <p> " Coffee ? " she said brightly to the other end of the table , as she felt the mood of the party sliding toward the floor . <p> Across from her , Gerald looked up . He smiled at the woman he had nearly killed once , then come to believe he loved . <p> " I 'll get it , " he told her . Before he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaker back on its bottom , and he brushed the spilled crystals from the tablecloth . <p> The man who had asked at the party about Allie Sprinkle remembered , on his way home , where he had heard her name before . " It 's the woman who took Laura 's picture , " he said to his wife , who was driving . " That woman Nicole was talking about , from their hometown ? Allie Sprinkle . That 's the name on the portrait we had done of Laura , when we lived in Rochester <p> " How do you remember these things ? Besides , that 's too much of a coincidence , " his wife said . " It could be a whole different person with the same name . Besides , who cares ? " <p> " Well , I do , " her husband said . " I like things like this . I like it when it turns out that people knew each other somewhere before ; It always makes me feel better , like the whole world is connected somehow . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashboard as she cut a corner too fast . " If you believe in the Bible , we 're all descended from Adam and Eve . If you go with the Big Bang , we all exploded from the same star , or crawled up from the same batch of ooze . Does n't that make you feel better about the world ? To imagine everybody 's related to everyone else ? " <p> " It does n't really make me feel anything , " his wife told him . " Besides , you 've been drinking <p> " It always makes me feel better , " he said again . They were home . <p> He remembered bringing his daughter to have her photograph taken by Allie Sprinkle . Allie worked where she lived , a house on a side street in a town whose name he could not recall , although Nicole 's " Oxbow " seemed to ring some bell . A. Sprinkle was bolted in black above the mailbox . <p> When she came to the door , Allie looked small against the shadows of the foyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in the studio , which had been converted from an upstairs bedroom , she inhabited twice as much space as her body required . The air around her was charged with movement , not only of her arms , which flew around Laura 's face and hair , but also of an energy that was almost visible in itself , like the confettied light thrown off by sparklers on the Fourth of July . <p> The portrait they ordered of Laura resembled a piece of art from an earlier century . Her eyes were locked in the camera 's hold , and they contained a cast of  --  could it be mercy ?  --  that neither he nor his wife recognized from before the photograph , and that they had n't witnessed since . His wife went so far as to suggest that the negatives had been altered . They loved the picture for the beauty that was their child , but they were each secretly afraid of it , and they each learned a way of walking through the living room without looking into those eyes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allie Sprinkle having known each other as children , and by his role as their connection later in life . In the strongbox that held the family 's papers , he found the sheet of contact proofs Allie had given them , and he ordered an extra print of Laura 's photograph . With the order he endosed a note to Allie , telling her of how her name had come up at a dinner party in Maryland . She sent the picture but did not respond to the note , and as the years passed , as Laura grew up to look less and less like the wise child watching him from above the piano , he found it easier to look at the face in the filigreed frame . Soon after the dinner party , he left the firm where Gerald Burke worked , and so he had no way of knowing that in the month following his message to western New York , a letter arrived at the Burkes ' home in Silver Spring , addressed to Nicole ( Rueger ) Burke . In the return address corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera , the name Sprinkle , and the legend Please let me shoot your kids . <p> The letter had been tucked , under the load of the day 's mail , into a newsmagazine ; Gerald found it that night as he turned the pages . He was in bed , and Nicole was in the bathroom . When he heard the bathroom door opening , he stuck the envelope back in the magazine , feeling his heart beat beneath his Orioles shirt . Nicole was damp from the shower , and she leaned over to kiss him , smelling of shampoo and cream . " Just a minute , honey , " he told her , and he carried the magazine into the bathroom . <p> He held the letter up over the sink , reached for the nail file in the toothbrush cup , and slit the seal with a sweep . <p> " Dear Nicole , " the letter started . It 's been a long time , but <p> do n't believe any of us could ever forget Everett Street . Or each other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congratulations . Although I 'm still amazed that you would marry Gerald when that puck was meant for me . " <p> As he read this , Gerald felt a chill on the backs of his hands , but when he looked beyond the paper into the mirror , he saw that he was smiling . With relief he noted that Allie had added a postscript "  --  Just kidding "  --  in the margin of that sinister line . <p> " The next time you 're in Oxbow , I 'd be happy to photograph your children . My work is taking pictures , and kids are my specialty . Enclosed is my car In the meantime , my best to Gerald , and I hope the headaches have gone away . <p> " Sincerely , Allie S. " <p> Gerald studied the signature closely , the way the S towered over the other letters , the way the A of Allie resembled a star . He put it back in the magazine and hid the whole surreptitious package in the basket of periodicals by the toilet . He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and energy that when it was over and they looked at each other before turning out the light , he was not surprised to see suspicion in the face she turned to him . <p> That was November . At the beginning of December , Gerald took Allie Sprinkle 's note and business card out of his briefcase , where he had been keeping the envelope since the day after it arrived . Answering the phone , she did not seem to hesitate when he said who he was , and for a moment he was afraid they might have had some contact in the past twenty years that he had forgotten since . " I intercepted your letter to Nicole : ' he told Allie , " by accident . But then I did n't give it to her , because I wanted to make it a surprise . The photograph . We 're coming there for Christmas , and I was wondering if you could take a picture of our kids . " Whenever he lied , his throat closed up and he had to keep clearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit . <p> Allie 's voice did not sound familiar , yet Gerald could , as they spoke , envision her dearly at the other end of the line . But then he realized he was picturing the small , sharp face in a stained snowsuit hood , turned up to the winter sky while the other girls watched hockey and called boys ' names to the stars . <p> He remembered the time his father , who owned a Chevrolet dealership , sold Mr. Sprinkle a new car . It happened fast : one Sunday the two men met at the sidewalk , taking a break from cutting their lawns , and Gerald 's father followed Mr. Sprinkle to the Plymouth Fury in the Sprinkles ' garage , popped the hood , and started talking as he pointed . Gerald , who was watching from a tree , saw that Mr. Sprinkle , who was a packer at the Feible Meat Company , did n't understand what Gerald 's father was saying . Mr. Sprinkle had an accent , and he gave little smiles of embarrassment as Gerald 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette . <p> After dinner that night , Gerald heard his father telling his mother about the conversation with Mr. Sprinkle . His father used the word chump . " Too bad the flocus valve had to blow like that , " his father was saying , and Gerald could tell that he was helping himself to the last piece of pie , eating it straight out of the pie dish in forkfuls . " That flocus valve will sure do it every time Then Gerald heard the sound of his father 's laughter blending with blueberry swallows . Gerald had not yet learned very much about cars , but he knew there was no such thing , in any model ever made , as a flocus valve . The next weekend , the Fury was gone , and Mr. Sprinkle was driving a new Nova from Burke Chevrolet . In the tree , Gerald watched Allie and her parents pull out of their driveway . Allie was in the back seat , and she saw Gerald and smiled and pointed at his name ornamenting the trunk , Burke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant with the gesture to thank his father for taking care of hers . <p> On the phone , Gerald and Allie arranged a date and time for Gerald to bring the children to be photographed . " I live in the Tartaglias ' old house now , " Allie told him . " Remember ? Behind the middle school He thought of the house with the long backyard where they sometimes had to chase home-run balls during kickball games . Mrs. Tartaglia used to sit on her back porch , sewing , and when <p> ball came rolling from the field onto her property , she acted as if she were about to have a heart attack . Nobody was ever willing to go get those balls except ALlie , so they always let her play . Two days before Christmas , Gerald set out with his family for Oxbow early in the morning . Because of the holiday traffic , the trip took most of a day . The kids spent the time fighting , snacking , and sleeping in the back seat , and Nicole napped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with the radio and the road . In Pennsylvania , when he rolled down his window for the toll ticket , he let in the cold air from outside , and his family woke up to complain . His son spit gum out the window , and his daughter performed a marriage ceremony between two of her dolls . " Do you , Jason , take her , Margo , to be your awfully wedded wife ? " <p> Finally , they came to the exit for Oxbow and headed into town . All around them was the swill of exhaust and gravel , and ahead they could see the old stockyard from Feible 's drawing near . When they came to Four Corners , Gerald was both dismayed and thrilled to realize how little had changed since they 'd last been here  --  could it be six years ? Yes , because their daughter had been in her infant seat , crying at the cold . As it had then and as far back as Gerald could remember , Costa 's Snack Shoppe stood between the beauty parlor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas tree in front of Grace Lutheran blinked pastels across the snow . <p> From the back seat , their daughter asked , " Why did you guys get married ? " <p> Nicole murmured over her shoulder , " Because we love each other , honey and , rolling up the window , looking in the mirror , Gerald saw with pride and pain that the baby knew better . They wound their way down their old street , which curved like an arm around Everett Pond . The afternoon had simmered into dusk , and teenagers were skating , girls in pairs or triples beside the banks , boys gliding in dreamy circles as they patted their pucks . It had snowed only a few times so far this year , and the pond 's shoreline was congested with slush and weeds . The ice itself was ragged ; they could see bumps in the gray surface , even from the car . <p> Still , though it was not as beautiful as they remembered , Nicole and Gerald held their breath together when they saw it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutual dream . <p> That night Gerald did n't wake up to hear the hockey game , but Nicole told him about it in the morning . It had gone on past one o'clock , because there was no school . Christmas Eve , the rink was quiet , and most of Everett Street went to midnight Mass . On Christmas night , the game started up again , and this time Gerald heard the familiar sounds through his sleep , the scrape of blades and the rings of laughter looping the empty trees . <p> He got out of bed and went to the window . Ice glittered on telephone wires . The flickery bulbs suspended above the pond had been replaced by floodlights which illuminated the whole rink , even the corners , where it used to be you could hide , if you wanted to leave the game for a few minutes to be alone with your heartbeat and stars . The girls did n't sit on a goal bench to watch anymore , but stood in a circle , some of them smoking cigarettes with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action passed by . They wore their daytime clothes under their coats and jackets , instead of pajamas and gowns . Occasionally they said something to one of the players , or admired a shot with a flirty hoot , but it was a tired admiration , and Gerald saw that the girls might just as well have been hanging out at Costa 's , laughing over pop and french fries , for all they cared about the game . He closed the curtain with a sick sensation and the feeling that he had been fooled . <p> The appointment he had made with Allie Sprinkle was for the next morning at ten o'clock . After breakfast , Nicole 's parents went out on errands , and Gerald stretched and said he thought he would go over to the Hello Dolly , to see if anybody was around . The Hello Dolly was the diner next to the Oxbow branch of the public library , which was so small that the smell of books dung to you when you left it , like cigarette smoke in a bar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was arranging herself beneath the afghan on the sofa , and Gerald knew there was no danger of her wanting to join him at the diner . Whenever they were in Oxbow and she saw someone she recognized , she crossed the street or aimed her eyes straight ahead with the look of a woman who had too much to think about . <p> " Some of the guys used to hang out for coffee , " Gerald said . " Like Usiak and Dickie and Bob Kelliher . Maybe they wo n't be there , and either way , I 'll only be a while . Hey , how about I swing by Costas on the way home , and pick up some wings for lunch ? The old recipe <p> " Yuck , " said the children in unison . Nicole 's smirk turned into a smile . She would never admit how much she craved the tart tang of her childhood , but he knew he had offered exactly what she missed most . <p> He kissed them all goodbye , which surprised everyone including himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt smaller and darker than the way he remembered it , and the air held more weight , as if he were climbing too high . On the stoop of the house he still thought of as Mrs. Tartaglias , he raised the knocker next to Allie Sprinkle 's name . When she answered , he had to squint into the light she brought with her to the door , and he felt the panic that comes from being seen clearly and not being able to see back . <p> " You 're here she said , reaching her arm out , and he stepped forward to hug the warm shadow before he realized she had only meant to shake hands across the distance between them . But by then it was too late to check his momentum , so he followed through , drawing her shoulders toward his coat and giving , a kiss to the hair by her ear . <p> " Where are your kids ? " she said , leaning to look beyond him at the empty stoop . <p> " They could n't come , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched his lie take physical shape in the form of white breath . " They got sick at the last minute . I figured I 'd keep the appointment , anyway He had not yet lifted his eyes entirely to meet hers . " I 'll pay for it , do n't worry . Like when you have to pay the doctor for not canceling in time . <p> Allie 's smile was stronger now  --  he could feel it , touching him  --  and he allowed himself , at last , to look at her . Her skin was darker and appeared slightly tough , the way it would be if life were a sun she had been exposed to in amounts hat were n't good for her . For the first time , he understood what it meant for someone 's features to grow into themselves ; her eyes were the right size , finally , for all the sorrow she stored in them , and her mouth was worn to a fine crease by laughter and  --  who knew ?  --  perhaps love . <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in his face . " Come on in . " <p> She took his coat and hung it on the banister knob . " I hope you do n't want me to take your picture , " Allie said , as she led him down the hallway to the kitchen , where water was whistling . " Because I should warn you , something bizarre happens when I put grown-ups in front of my camera . They all come out looking like Richard Nixon . " <p> " Even the women ? " <p> " Especially the women She laughed , inviting him to join her in it . It was the sound he associated with winter nights at the pond , but before he could even realize this completely , Allie set a cup of tea down in front of him and said , " You know , I drove home by way of our old street the other day . It was before supper , just getting dark , and the little kids were still out on their double-runners . They all kept falling and then trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , till their moms came over to help them back up . " She smiled at the memory of what she had seen . " I know we all learned how to skate together when we were their age , but mostly when I remember growing up on Everett Street , I think about that night . " <p> He knew right away , of course , which night she meant . She was talking about the accident : about those moments when he sent the puck with a clean crack into the shadows , lost it , then heard and saw the hard black circle knocking Nicole Rueger in the side of her pretty head . In the months that followed , he had watched the scene often behind closed eyes . He began with receiving the pass flat at the edge of his stick from Michael Usiak , feeling the puck sit there on the wood for a few seconds before he hauled off and slapped it , no holding back . Then came the images of Nicole lying on the ice , her long hair splayed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee ; Nicole coming home from the hospital , using her parents as crutches , a white bandage where she used to have bangs . <p> But what was most vivid to Gerald about that night was not anything about his victim , or what happened after she fell , but what it felt like to hit the puck the way he had , as hard as he could , one solid stroke and a single motion , letting everything go . Afterward he asked himself , when he could stand to , if he had known it was possible he might hit one of the girls . The puck had not gone anywhere near the goal he would have scored in . Was there a wish involved ? Had he  --  God help him  --  even aimed ? He did n't think so , but he could n't be sure , and the not being sure was what kept him awake so many nights when he should have been sleeping . <p> Of course , he would never tell Nicole that . When , because his mother made him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she came home , he kept his head lowered , and he even , briefly , touched her hand , a gesture unusual for any twelve-year-old boy , but remarkable in him . By the time she was well enough to go back to school , he began picking her up in the mornings so they could walk together , apart from the other Everett Street kids . Before then he had always walked with Michael and Dickie , and they had plenty of things to say to him , none kind or clever , about his new habit of walking with a girl . <p> When they kissed for the first time , one January afternoon on the way home  --  they 'd stayed late , he for detention and she for cheerleading , and it was already dark as they came to the pond  --  it felt to both of them like what was supposed to happen next . It was a quick kiss , little more than lips overlapping , but they both knew what it meant . They were officially a couple ; he had consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from the old class photograph of Miss Huberty 's second grade , and she taped the pictures to each side of the locket her parents had given her on her hospital homecoming . <p> " Me , too , " he said to Allie now , referring to that night . He could feel , in his chest and throat , the desire to tell her about the joke Nicole had made out of the accident over the years , knocking over the salt shaker with her fingertips . But before his voice found the first word , he discovered that he did not want to tell her . Instead , he turned the impulse into a cough . <p> Allie nodded as if she understood . " I always wondered what would have happened , if I had been the one , " she said , and Gerald believed he heard a tremble in her voice . " Instead of Nicole . You know ? " He did know , perhaps more than she did ; but he also knew that he should n't admit it . He closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different route , fallen to gravity sooner , found Allie Sprinkle as its mark . The vision stirred a sweet wailing in his gut as he heard the apocalyptic approach of a town truck coming through to spread salt on the street . Before he could open his eyes again , the backs of Allie 's warm fingers were laid against his forehead , the way a mother checks for fever in a child . <p> He had never been touched by her before , and he knew he should be startled , but it felt  --  what was the word he wanted ?  --  more ancient , or familiar  --  than Nicole 's touch ever had . <p> Allie took her hand away from his face when he looked at her , and recklessly Gerald reached out to cover her fingers with his own . But she retreated , pulling away a loose fist from the question in his clasp . " I have n't seen you since the night of graduation , " she said . " Remember how hot it was , under those rented robes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the best feeling of my life . It was like those nights at the pond , before the accident . I could sit there and dose my eyes , and feel love floating around in the air like snow . " <p> Gerald watched as he listened , resisting the temptation to touch her lips with his fingers . She seemed to be saying something he had always known , but which he had never heard before , in his own voice or any other . " Remember when Emil Marsh brought in those cocoa cookies his mother made for the bake sale , and everybody made fun of them because they looked like turds ? Emil was trying to laugh , but I could see him swallowing . It made me so sad , I felt like screaming . Same with Karen Harder , the time she wore that skirt with the dog her grandmother sewed on it . Girls used to wear poodles like that . Her grandmother just did n't know they did n't anymore . And we were too old to think a dog on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all knew it was queer . <p> " The only time nobody ever made fun of anyone was during the hockey games . Then we were all just out there together , laughing in the cold Allie was staring into her teacup . Steam slithered from the surface , and Gerald imagined it was this warmth flushing her face . When she said , " Come upstairs , " he stood hastily , banging his knee on the table . On the steps , he made sure not to follow too closely , in case she stopped without warning and he could not keep himself from reaching up to begin an embrace . <p> She opened a door at the top of the hallway and led him inside . Again , there was too much light coming in through a wide window , and he beat his eyes fast a few times to adjust to the snowblink and sun . It was not a bedroom . On the far side of the room was a rolled backdrop , with sitting stools of various heights anchoring the canvas where the roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a collection of cameras and other equipment  --  umbrellas and meters , flash fixtures and lights  --  surrounded a tripod that looked almost like a human figure , tall and skinny , beckoning to them as Gerald and Allie stepped through the door . <p> Allie went to the window and covered it with a cloth screen . It was then , as the room became dim enough to examine , that Gerald saw the children looking out at him from the walls . They were black-and-white photographs of faces , all with eyes focused straight at the camera . Some were smiling ; others only stared . Even the faces of the unbeautiful children riveted him with a force far more powerful than beauty . All of them knew who they were , but they did not yet know who they would be , and it was this freedom that Allie had embalmed on her film . <p> Gerald went toward the faces and touched some of the frames . Allie was watching him , and when he drew in his breath and held it , she moved closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , and brought his lips near hers , she pulled away . <p> " Go home , Gerald , " she whispered . Outside , the salt truck screeched , sounding like the duck-and-cover drills they 'd learned as children . <p> " Bob Kelliher 's father still driving that thing ? " Gerald moved to the window to lift the screen and look out , though his vision was blurred . <p> " No , " Allie said from behind him , still whispering . " Bob is Gerald turned to her again , showing a smile which he knew must look as foolish as it felt . " Would you take my picture ? " he said , already knowing the answer but trying to sound as if he believed she might change her mind . <p> She smiled back , her lips rising to the corners of well-worn grooves . " No . " <p> " Please ? I 'll pay you . I mean it . I want you to He knew that both of them could hear the urgency in his voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Allie  --  " He reached out again to pull her to him . The lust he felt was not for her body , or even for her . It was the desire to have that night and his life back , and it was the fiercest love he had ever felt . <p> " Gerald , no . " Allie moved to the wall to straighten one of the frames he had slanted without realizing , then motioned for Gerald to precede her out of the studio . Behind her , she shut the door . <p> " Could I stay a little longer , then ? To talk ? " he asked , when they reached the bottom of the stairs . But he saw that Allie was pretending she had n't heard him as she handed him his coat . <p> They went outside . The morning had turned warm , windy , and he felt too hot in his heavy sleeves . The sky and the snow seemed the same shade of gray ; in her front yard , Gerald bent over to pick up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a ball , but it fell apart in his fingers . Still , he tried to toss it so that the melting fragments would shower around Allie in a festive rain . When this did n't work , he gave the stupid smile again , and winked streaks of wetness from the edges of his eyes . <p> He took out his billfold , but before he could open it , Allie reached over to press his fingers closed around the leather . " Do n't , Gerald , " she told him . " I wo n't take it . " <p> He started to answer her , but then he knew not to , and he got in his car and began backing out of the driveway . In the cold , watching him , Allie tried hugging herself , but as he pulled away , he could see that it was n't enough . <p> He had not been about to give her money . He only wanted to show her pictures of his kids . <p> He drove the streets without steering , back through Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , past the funeral home . Though it had turned brighter outside , the air still felt heavy , as if something not in the forecast was headed his way . <p> When they were in junior high , the girls all had to wear gym suits , which they bought from the Little Folks Shop . Mr. Neander , Sue Neander 's father and the man who would , a few years later , back out of his driveway on a foggy October morning in his Impala and hit and kill Craig Domermuth , Dickie 's little brother , who was riding his bike to school , ordered the suits specially at the beginning of every year . The boys got to wear whatever they wanted in the way of gym shirts and shorts , and the classes were boys and girls together , so half of the court or field was always in uniform and the other half was n't . <p> What was it that happened to Mr. Neander after Craig Domermuth died ? Of course Gerald remembered hearing everything about it , how Sue 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive the car off the boy 's body ; later , they said this was probably what killed him . After school that day , all the kids went by Sue 's house to see if they could tell anything . Mrs. Neander was out at the end of the driveway , running a hose on the street . She must have been standing there for a long time already , because the pavement was soaked and the water reached as far down as two houses on either side . When she saw them all watching her , she lifted the hose a little , without seeming to mean to , and the spray came toward them , making them all stumble backward to avoid getting wet . <p> Their retreat made Mrs. Neander cry . " Please , " she said to them across the stream that sounded like summer , " please , " But none of them knew what she meant . Mr. Neander never went to jail or even had charges pressed against him , because it had been so foggy that morning , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Sue came back to school the following week , and everybody held their breath the first time she and Dickie Domermuth passed in the hall . But they were all disappointed . There were no screams or slaps between them , no apologies and no truce . Maybe these had been exchanged when nobody was looking . More likely , though , it was easier just not to admit it in any way . It was over and done with , was what the sermon at the funeral seemed to say . <p> But this was all still ahead of them , after they learned to drink beer in the stockyard , after the first girl in their class got pregnant and had the baby , after nobody could force them to wear gym suits anymore . The girls ' outfits were blue on the bottom and white on the top , one-piece cotton suits that zipped up the back and showed every burgeoning bump of soft bodies coming to the fore . <p> One hot afternoon in April , they were playing softball . Gerald was playing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell rang and they began to go in , Allie walked ahead of him , and Gerald squinted at the slow shape in front of him , to make sure of what he saw . A brown-red stain spread from between her legs and up the seat of her gym suit , which clung and gathered in the clenched place between her thighs . He did not perceive what it was at first , and when he did  --  in that sudden way things make sense so that we can never , after that moment , remember what it was like not to understand them  --  he wanted to catch up to her and hand her his windbreaker and tell her not to ask any questions , just tie this around your waist . <p> But he did n't . It was impossible to translate what he knew he should do into an action , the same way it had been impossible to hold back on that sitting puck . Instead , when he saw Nicole coming in from left field , he called her over . " Do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . Nicole looked , and he saw a cruel smile take hold of her lips . <p> " Do something , " he said again , as Allie kept walking , oblivious , wearing her womanhood for everyone to see . She was getting dose to the rest of the class , the girls in their gym suits with their secrets and smiles , and the boys throwing the softball back and forth between mitts , except for the one boy who always carried the bats and bases to and from the equipment room , balancing the wood on one shoulder with the rubber mats in his other hand . Gerald always wondered why this boy was responsible for it all , why they did n't each take a piece of the game back with them to make it fair ; but nobody ever offered to help , and Mr. Carmody did n't make them , so it was always the same boy who carried everything , and he never complained . <p> Allie Sprinkle kept walking , passing some of the pack . Gerald watched as first the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately down at the ground , as if he wanted to give back what he 'd seen . Then some of the girls caught on , and the gasps and laughter made the whole class look , and Nicole ran ahead of Gerald to find her friends , and he saw Allie come to understand what must be happening and to feel the wet shame widening between her legs . <p> Somebody said , She must 've fell on the floor at Feible , which caused a fresh wave of hilarity to float across the field . <p> Come here , Alice , Mr. Carmody said , but she would n't . I said come HERE , he said , and instead she walked sideways across the field and through the bushes by Mrs. Tartaglia 's house . After lunch she came back to school wearing the gym suit blouse tucked into a long , old-lady skirt that had been cinched at the waist with a velveteen sash . The mocking started all over again when she appeared in this costume , tardy to Earth Science , and as she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Gerald 's face . He tried not to look back , but he could n't help it . Now , he remembered what he had known in the moment their eyes met , and in the next  --  because he was not ready to know it  --  forgotten : Although she looked like nobody they would ever admit wanting to be , Allie 's face held a peace that they had all lost without realizing , and that they would spent the rest of their lives seeking and failing to retrieve . <p> As he stepped into the house , scraping his shoes on the stoop to get the slush from Allie 's yard out of his shoes , Gerald could tell that everyone was home . The children were playing a new electronic video game . Nicole 's parents had returned from the pharmacy and the salon . He could hear them all in the living room , talking at the same time . Nicole was still on the sofa , a thumb holding her place in her book while she watched what the children were doing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the angle of her brow , he saw that he had let her down again in the way only he could , without even knowing . It was the look she used to get along with the headaches , halfway between accusation and an appeal . He shrugged his coat off and threw it across a chair , and only then did he realize that his hands were empty , and he knew even before she did what his wife was going to say . <p> " Well ? " she asked , and everyone else in the room stopped to listen for his answer . " I thought you were going to bring me back some wings . " <p>
