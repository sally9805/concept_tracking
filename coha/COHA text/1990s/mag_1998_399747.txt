" Bravery , " Burt Reynolds says , " is the only thing that makes me cry . " * In that case , tears should be streaming down the lapels of the 62-year-old 's navy blazer : After a string of career choices that make Elizabeth Taylor 's pick of husbands seem well thought out , Reynolds ' decision to take a role in Boogie Nights was a heroic leap of faith . Not only was Reynolds stepping into the really , really ugly ' ' 70s shoes of a pornographer , he was also required to make the character an avuncular type who truly cares for the drug-addled lowlifes who populate his home and movies . And he had to walk this tightrope under the guidance of thenunknown 25-year-old writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson . * " I knew I had to do something really brave to turn things around , " Reynolds says in the kind of professorial tone that , if this were a movie , would call for him to exhale his pipe smoke and gaze into the distance . Instead , he swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the closet of his Jupiter , Fla. , ranch home for this New York jaunt ) onto a coffee table and continues . " I had nothing to lose . " Photograph // True , he lost it a long time ago . In 1972 , Reynolds displayed remarkable depth in Deliverance , and subsequent hits such as 1974 's The Longest Yard and 1977 's Smokey and the Bandit proved his comic box office appeal . But , says Deliverance costar and friend Jon Voight , " he had all this talent , and he did n't know how to let people know . He did n't appreciate his own gift . " In the late ' ' 70s , Reynolds began a two-decade run of self-sabotage : He made an awful sequel to Smokey and the Bandit ; bad choices became worse ones when , starting in the 1980s , he hit financial trouble , admitted to a dependence on a painkiller resulting from a debilitating inner-ear illness ( rumored to have been AIDS ) , and divorced Loni Anderson with enough drama to keep Inside Edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detour into television with the CBS sitcom Evening Shade ( 1990-94 ) , Reynolds was staring at a movie career that seemed doomed . After a hoped-for comeback in 1996 's Striptease slipped beyond his reach , the actor resigned himself , he says , to a shelf life in " the nostalgia section of Blockbuster . " So let 's throw a little luck into the pot along with the bravery , because not even the Psychic Friends on a good day could have predicted that Boogie Nights , which costars Mark Wahlberg , Julianne Moore , and William H. Macy , would earn Reynolds a New York Film Critics Circle award , a Golden Globe dingus , and a ticket to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as a Best Supporting Actor contender . But just as Reynolds failed to recognize his gifts in the 1970s , he did n't initially appear confident about his performance in Boogie Nights . The press reported that Reynolds disliked the movie , a rumor fanned by the actor 's decision to leave two different agencies after wrapping Boogie Nights . " They were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hop from UTA to the Gersh Agency to ICM , where he is now . He denies that he wanted to distance himself from the movie . " I told them they had something to run with , and they did n't .... If I wanted to make a statement , I would n't have gone to the New York Film Festival where the film premiered in September , walked out onto the stage , and held up the director 's arm in front of everyone . I said , I 'm putting every chip I have on red , and you ca n't say in the middle , Uh ... black . " ' The gray area is where Reynolds lands when it comes to Thomas Anderson 's efforts : " The first hour had a hyper energy that he brought to it that 's ... hyper , " Reynolds says hesitantly , as if unsure whether that 's a good thing . " Is it too long ? I think so . Do I think he 's a good filmmaker ? Yes . " The actor is fielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fiancee Pam Seals , a hideout where for years , he says , he was able to pass himself off to the natives as being in " semiretirement . " With that no longer necessary , " L.A. is better than ever , because it 's not that I ca n't live there , it 's that I choose not to , " he says . " I 'm tired of going out there and waving at my houses . Hi , I owned you . Hello , house , I owned you . ' Now I do n't care . " Reynolds is wisely leaving many of his career decisions in the hands of ICM , which has hooked him up with Pond Rules , a David E. Kelley-written hockey drama directed by Jay Roach . ( Reynolds also committed himself to three TNT movies before settling on an agency ; he 'll film them back-to-back after Pond Rules . ) " I think Burt 's done a lot of projects because he 's had terrible financial problems , and he 's had to take jobs , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting appropriate money and the chance to play a different character than he has before . " In Pond Rules , which began shooting in Canada in January , Reynolds and Russell Crowe ( L.A. Confidential ) star as amateur players taking on the New York Rangers . " I 'll never take a script for any reason than the words again , " Reynolds vows . " I 've had this thing that I can make it better . Well , you can make it better , but it 's better crap . " It 's suggested to Reynolds that the time has come for him to write his own script in case he lands at the podium on March 23 . But if Reynolds has ever rehearsed such a speech ( and what actor , finding himself stuck in a bad traffic jam , has n't ? ) , he 's not copping to it , though he may have learned something from the mistakes of other winners-like ex-lover Sally Field , whose infamous " You like me " monologue back in 1985 has become legendary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did n't make the best speech in the world , but she has to be forgiven . " And then , seizing upon the topic he 's been circling , he looks up with one eyebrow raised . " I once said , because I was never going to win one , that I 'd rather have a Heisman trophy than an Oscar , " says the former college football player , suddenly showing his dimples and confidence and looking very much like a movie star . " I lied . " <p>
