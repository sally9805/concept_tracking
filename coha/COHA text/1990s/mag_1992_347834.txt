TITLE : DOLORES CLAIBORNE <P> AUTHOR : STEPHEN KING <P> PUBLISHER : VIKING ; 305 PAGES ; $23.50 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The world 's oldest teenage author cranks out another one . <P> Stephen King here tries a novel without his customary latex spider webs and prop-department zombies , and nearly makes it work . What drives Dolores Claiborne is a powerful characterization of the title figure , a cranky old Maine islander who takes no guff from life or death . In a rasping , unrepentant tale to police , she admits to murdering her rotten husband 30 years ago . Narrative logic is murky here , but her confession is supposed to show that , on the other hand , she has not murdered her employer , a rich , loony off-islander . <P> King 's mimicry is startlingly good , but as always , his artistic sensibility is that of a clever 14-year-old . His interest is caught by yucky death scenes and weird delusions , and he does n't really care that these are n't the real horrors that adults deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gets her husband to fall down an old well , " the reader imagines King thinking , " and he yells up at her to help him . She just smiles and kind of falls asleep , and the next thing she knows he 's climbed up the inside of the well , and he grabs her by the foot , and she can feel his slimy , bloody hand . . . " <P> If you 're old enough for your very own library card , this is n't frightening ; it 's just silly . But King 's fans , subteens of all ages , wo n't mind at all .
