<p> Hey , it 's crazy out there on the coast . So begins the usual comedy lounge- lizard routine . It 's the signal that we 're in for a another round of cliches about life on the edge , the land of fruits and nuts , the place where the sun melts your brain  --  where people are so laid back they get Rolfed during earthquakes , where support groups are forming for Adult Children of Somewhat Remote Fathers . <p> It 's California bashing , the game the whole country can play . <p> During a recent Monday Night Football game between the 49ers and the Rams , announcer Al Michaels observed to his co- host , Dan Dierdorf , that the fans in Anaheim were getting restless . " Yeah , Al , " replied Dierdorf , " but restless in Anaheim is different than restless in New York or Philadelphia . Restless here means they throw sushi . " <p> The line sounded dated already because the California being bashed here has changed rapidly from a land of excess wealth and silliness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office buildings . The changing economic climate can be seen in such leading indicators as the fact that this year the Barbie in the bikini went from Malibu Barbie to Hawaiian Barbie . <p> They bashed us when they envied us and now they 're kicking us when we 're down . The latest round of California bashing includes a smug , puritanical " I-told- **36;387;TOOLONG **33;425;TOOLONG pools " quality . <p> The East Coast press has indulged in this kind of scorn from the Gold Rush days . ( " The rush to California . . . reflects the greatest disgrace on mankind , " chided Henry David Thoreau with hindsight in The Atlantic in 1860 . ) A recent New York Times story about the Oakland fire moralized , " Building on Sand : Pain Repays Reckless California . " Last month Time magazine devoted a whole deadly serious issue to it . <p> Like , why do n't they like us ? <p> In the Time story , they 're all , " It is still America 's promised land  --  a place of heart-stopping beauty . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can it preserve the dream ? " <p> The dream with which California has been entrusted  --  and encrusted  --  is the American dream of a place of your own . Add : in the sun . But as the cost of a home has escalated and the opportunity to earn the money to buy it has become scarcer , the nature of California-bashing is changing too . During boom times the bashing is funnier . During bust times the bashing is bitter and often comes from within . <p> " It used to be mainly the cuckoo stuff , " says New Yorker writer Calvin Trillin . Trillin denied that he ever indulged in California bashing until he was forced to recall a piece he 'd written in 1985 about judging a chili contest in Mexico . In it he said , " There is a theory that sooner or later anything in America that 's any fun at all will be ruined by people from California . The theory is based on the fact that a number of people in California tend to apply themselves too intensely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soap-bubble blowing is an example . . . . " <p> OK . He admits maybe he took one or two cheap shots at us in the past , but certainly he never made a hot tub joke or an **36;460;TOOLONG joke when those were the rage . On further reflection : " Oh , I may have said something once about what people talk about in hot tubs with their clothes off  --  real estate  --  but not anymore . I have n't even heard the word Sausalito in years . " <p> Trillin first achieved **32;498;TOOLONG listening to Bob Hope routines about the smog , mocking the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and its boosterism . " The jokes all depended on the Chamber calling the smog something else . You do n't hear California smog jokes anymore because now everyone else has it . " <p> As a child in St. Joseph , Missouri , Trillin knew California as the place where everyone , including his own father , wanted to go to start a new life , a place where the air was fresh . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Oregon has become California . " <p> If you want to get killed , just say that to the Oregonians , who have adopted the slogan , " Do n't Californicate Oregon . " <p> In New York City , where Trillin ended up , the California jokes used to center on the crassness and stupidity of Californians . He recalls Dustin Hoffman saying , " If you live there long enough you turn into a Mercedes . " And he quotes Woody Allen : " How can you live in a place whose major cultural advantage is : Right Turn on Red ? " <p> But California bashing is losing its light- hearted quality , says Trillin , because of the " possibility that God did n't actually intend people living in California . With the fires , earthquakes , mudslides  --  that is growing in people 's minds . " <p> No-nonsense Chicago columnist Mike Royko also denies he 's a California basher , even though he recently acknowledged , and apologized for , dubbing Jerry Brown " Governor Moonbeam . " Royko points out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't forgotten the controversary that surrounded his poking fun at 49er fans after Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka spat a wad of gum at them . " I think I called the fans too sensitive . The mayor , Dianne Feinstein , wrote to me . I was surprised she 'd react at all . If I 'd bashed a town in Indiana I 'd expect to hear from the governor , but I thought San Francisco was a sophisticated city . I could bash New York forever and all a New Yorker would say is : So ? " <p> Royko reminds us that writers have been California bashing since the days of Mark Twain . " I guess it 's because it 's a vivid place . You can poke fun at the pretentiousness of people who believe they are on the cutting edge of all trends . It 's true that you do n't see people jumping off buildings attached by rubber bands in Chicago . " <p> Our elected officials , a club that includes the likes of Sonny Bono and Clint Eastwood , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoofers as senators , movie stars as governors  --  California 's always elected eccentric people . " But back in a town that defined normality for 20 years as Richard J. Daley the First , even Royko admits some of the fun has gone out of ganging up on the Golden State . " I have n't felt like bashing California in a while , " he says . <p> As the problems of the state turn serious , most California bashing seems to be coming from Californians themselves . A Time poll showed 26 percent fewer residents feel the the state is the best place to live than did so in 1985 . <p> When Governor Pete Wilson recently decried the large numbers of poor immigrants coming into the state , writer Wallace Stegner said , " Wilson sounded exactly like 1932 to me . " He was referring to the era when the state was so flooded with poor Arkies and Okies that guards were posted at the entry points demanding the newcomers show money before entering . It was not a time of lighthearted joking . Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you ca n't come to California if you ai n't got the " Do Re Mi . " <p> " I wish the California dream could be based on the realities of the state instead of some illusions , " said Stegner . " The reality now is too little rain and too little water . " <p> Unfortunately , California has always been a place where illusions have preceded reality . In fact , the state began in the mind of Spanish novelist Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 when he described an island called California , quite near paradise , populated by gorgeous women and covered with gold . Thirty years later , when Hernan Cortes sent a party to explore the Pacific Coast , the travelers tagged the land with the name from the popular romance . In a pageant that would be re-enacted for generations , the Spaniards came hoping that the New World would live up to the myth . <p> When the instant El Dorado did not materialize , the bashing turned bitter . After several exploratory passes along the coast , twice missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the first recorded instance of California bashing  --  wrote that the New World contained " neither wealthy nations nor navigable passages . " <p> This boom and bust , rave and decry history would be repeated through the Gold Rush and every other rush the state provided a rush-hungry nation . J. S. Holliday , who wrote the history of the Gold Rush titled " The World Rushed In , " feels the major images of California in the popular mind date back to the repressed America of the 1850s , when those who came here learned , " You can behave any darned way you want . California became associated with freedom , excess and sin . " <p> And when the sins turned from drinking , gambling and whoring to murder , drugs and mayhem , the bashing got uglier . Jim Rawls , KPIX commentator and author of " Dr. History 's Whizz-Bang Favorite Stories of California 's Past , " recalls that during the late 1960s and early ' 70s , all the positive aspects of the California mythos were turned to criticisms , as summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dream in a Body Bag . " <p> " In 1970 , for the first time as many people were leaving the state as coming in , " says Rawls . " The freedom and romance which the state always represented were seen as having gone haywire , from the Free Speech Movement to the hippies to the Manson family to the Zebra and Zodiac murders . California became a place that was weird , untethered , obsessed with health fads , narcissistic , cultish and fascinated with death . " <p> Similarly , in the last year California 's image has changed from a place of sushi- eating yuppies in BMWs to an overpopulated , drought-stricken , job-losing , real-estate-busted land . Its images of heart-stopping beauty have become images of a place constantly at risk for natural disasters . <p> But Rawls looks at the phoenix-like history of the state and says , " We 've been down before , but so far recorded history indicates we 've always been able to find gold , silver , real estate , Hollywood , oil , high tech  --  some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of fretting over " the endangered dream " may be the end of California as a national joke . But if history can teach us anything , you 'll know the recession 's over when the comedians start saying things like : Hey , did you hear about the Californian who got a job in biotech ? He crossed a peach with a virus and now he 's got an apricot that sneezes .
