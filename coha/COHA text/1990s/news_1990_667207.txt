<p> Charles Masson labored in obscurity through the 1980s , helping troubled companies work out debt-overload problems . All the while , his investment-banker colleagues were generating headlines and wealth by engineering leveraged buyouts - buying companies with borrowed money . <p> But merger mania died . Masson , director of the restructuring group at Salomon Bros. , now is the one with the catch-me-if-you-can work schedule - not the mergers-and-acquisitions hotshots . He 's the one lecturing at business schools , the one getting flooded with resumes and expanding his staff . " The M &A; guys used to walk past my office and snicker , " Masson says , smiling . " Now they come and ask me if I 'll teach them how to do this . " <p> Increasingly , Masson and other workout specialists on Wall Street are saying yes to such requests . As the economy weakens , companies that loaded up on debt during merger mania - either to take over another company or to avoid being taken over - are struggling to make their interest payments . Salvaging such companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street . In many cases , the same investment bankers who were pitching the wonders of debt to corporate managers as recently as three years ago now are helping them shed it . <p> The 1990s is the age of anti-debt . In the past year , virtually every big brokerage has set up or beefed up a workout division to help companies swap bonds for stock or otherwise restructure loans . Indeed , some worry that the field already is so crowded that , like the leverage craze of the 1980s , the de-leverage trend integral to workouts also will go too far . <p> Nothing unusual about that . Wall Street is prone to pushing a good thing too far . In the late ' 60s and ' 70s , diversification was all the rage and Wall Street helped hundreds of corporations such as ITT , Beatrice and Kraft buy businesses they knew nothing about . When those companies became so loaded with diverse operations that managers lost focus , Wall Street was there in the 1980s to take them apart - for a fat fee , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the damage left by the debt craze it encouraged through the highflying ' 80s . Goldman Sachs &; Co. put together a $ 783.5 million fund in October to invest in debt-troubled companies . Earlier , Merrill Lynch &; Co. raised $ 1 billion for the Chicago- based Zell/Chilmark Fund , which seeks to invest in restructured companies . There are 20 to 30 smaller funds with similar goals . <p> Among those jumping on board : Donald Trump , who two weeks ago agreed to give bondholders as much as 50% ownership of his financially troubled Taj Mahal casino in exchange for lower interest payments . Last week , Greyhound Lines agreed to cede a 95% ownership stake to bondholders in exchange for forgiving some debt and lowering interest payments on the rest . Merv Griffin worked out a similar deal in August . Leveraged-buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &; Co. did it with its Seaman Furniture Co. last year . <p> The favorite vehicle of the ' 80s debt buildup was the leveraged buyout , or LBO . Now meet the LBO 's youthful offspring , the de-leveraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into owners by raising billions of dollars in debt to let managers buy their companies , either from shareholders or parent firms . Greyhound Lines managers did it in 1987 to buy the bus line from what is now Greyhound Dial Corp . DBOs seek to reverse the process , making owners mere managers again by giving controlling blocks of stock to bondholders or third-party investors - such as Zell/Chilmark or the Goldman fund - that come up with rescue money to pay some debt . <p> Experts fear Wall Street 's scramble to build workout staffs might well guarantee that the trend goes too far . Some firms have as many as 25 bankers looking for debt-restructuring deals , vs. only one or two before . In the push for new business , it might be only a matter of time before they are restructuring healthy companies - eliminating debt where that debt is manageable and is in fact fueling the company 's growth . <p> It 's not all that far-fetched , concedes Samuel Hayes , professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School . " Wall Street is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Often they get carried away by momentum . " <p> But getting carried away in favor of stock could be as damaging as getting carried away in favor of debt was . Companies need a balanced marketplace that lets them choose the financing that works best for them . A Wall Street that becomes as crazed with anti-debt deals as it did with debt deals could make for a growing number of inefficient companies , hampered in raising the money they need to compete globally . Some observers go so far as to suggest that favoring stock over debt too much could , in five years or so , drive stock prices artificially high , setting up the market for a 1987-style crash . <p> Presumably , Wall Street would step in at that point with another solution - and another fee . " I wish I could argue against it " happening , says Nathan Thorne , managing director and head of Merrill Lynch 's workout division . " But that 's how financial markets work . " <p> Wall Streeters insist that de-leveraging wo n't spin out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance , " notes Thomas Gallagher , a partner at the law firm Gibson , Dunn &; Crutcher , which represented Merv Griffin in the recent restructuring of his Resorts International . " It tends to be forced on you . " So , he says , it is unlikely that Wall Street can sell DBOs where they are n't wanted . <p> Still , there might be enough legitimate demand to sustain Wall Street for a while . Mikael Salovaara , a Goldman Sachs partner who manages the firm 's restructuring fund , estimates that as much as $ 150 billion of debt will need to be restructured in three to five years ; of that , $ 40 billion probably is suitable for a debt-to-stock swap . " De-leveraging is not a fad , " he says . " It is a necessity done against the backdrop of too much debt . " <p> Salomon 's Masson concedes a certain irony in these troubled companies seeking advice on Wall Street after Wall Street raised the debt that got them into trouble . " But I 'm not convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , " he asserts . He says company managers are far too sophisticated to be led around by the ear and calls it " intellectually shallow " to assume that they can be talked into things they do n't want . Still , he allows that " maybe Wall Street created the atmosphere " that let it happen . <p> There are two basic ways for a company to work out its debt problem : get banks or bondholders to lower interest payments or extend payment deadlines , or swap part of the debt for stock - a DBO . In either case , the company gets a cost saving that can spell the difference between making a profit or facing bankruptcy . But neither option is simple . Merely stretching out payments often does n't give a troubled company enough breathing room . And asking bondholders to swap their bonds for stock is like asking the local barber to accept payment in Japanese yen . " They do n't really understand how it will be valued , " says Tom Davis , a managing director and part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt-for-stock swap is often the best solution . Prime candidates are companies whose core businesses are healthy but whose coffers are being robbed by debt overload . One unfortunate result of the trend : It waters down the ownership stake of an otherwise effective management team - reversing one of the undisputed benefits of the debt-crazy ' 80s . <p> " If in the course of restructuring all this debt managers see their share of the business erode , will they have the same incentive to hustle ? " says Harvard 's Hayes . " If not , I guess we 're back to where we started .
