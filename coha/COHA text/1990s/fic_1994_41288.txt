I had been to Los Angeles before and hated it . Whenever I had gone to visit , I had been irritated by the sweat-stained dinginess of the place , its perpetual five-o'clock shadow . I had been irritated by the lack of seasons . But two years ago when I flew out for my father 's funeral , I thought something was different as soon as I got off the plane . I rolled down the window in the taxi and the air was cold and sharp . I could see the mountains . I could smell the salt . It was Saturday morning . A woman on Wiltshire Boulevard seemed amazingly good looking , amazingly well dressed . <p> I have a condition which recurs every few years , and you 'd think I 'd learn to recognize the signs . Instead I 'm , always taken by surprise . The problem is the condition starts with a feeling of optimism and hope , so I do n't mind . That morning in the cab , I was in a good mood . I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time that my father might have been looking for something when he moved out here . Always I had thought about him running away , pushed instead of pulled . People had always said there was more work for him out here , but when I was a child , " more work " seemed like a bad reason to do anything . A bad reason to leave my mother and the house that he had built . A bad reason to move a continent away and live in a polluted city where the weather never changed . I was ten years old when he left , and I believe I had no conscious resentment . Already by that time he was a stranger . I barely remember him living with us , and it 's not because my memory is bad . Later , I did n't miss what I had never known . My mother never spoke of him . <p> I checked into my hotel . I planned to spend one night , and then take a bus up the Owens River the next morning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I had taken a few days ' vacation to go hiking . When I had spoken to my stepmother on the phone , I had found myself asking her whether I could take some of my father 's ashes to bury up on Darwin Bench  --  a place of mystical significance to me , I implied . She seemed delighted , started to cry in fact , which embarrassed me . It 's just that having organized my vacation , I thought I had to make it seem as if it were somehow part of the funeral , a cathartic and necessary experience , perhaps . In order to get time off at short notice I told my supervisor the same story , leaving her touched by the impression that my father and I had taken many trips together up into the mountains . <p> My life is full of such falsehoods , which does n't make them easier to bear . In my hotel , I laid out my camping gear on the floor of my room . I replaced the bushings on my stove , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes from the top compartment of my backpack  --  a gray wool suit . I put it on , knotted my tie , and stood looking at myself in the mirror on the back of the bathroom door . I looked good in my suit , a fragile version of my father . In it I exhibited the only gift my father ever gave me , though even that had come diluted through my mother . I made faces in front of the mirror and rearranged my hair ; always when I had come out to visit my father I had taken trouble with my looks , suspecting in some obscure way that this would offer a reproach to him . That it would make him miss my mother , and miss me . At home I did n't care . This suit was the only suit I owned , which made wearing it a kind of ritual . <p> I washed my face and washed my hands again . The air in my hotel room had depressed me , but when I stepped out into the street I felt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californians on the sidewalk . I found myself in a neighborhood where all the streets were named after Eastern colleges , my stepmother had given me directions to the church . It was a ten-minute walk . As I came around the corner of Brown Street , I slowed down . I composed my face . <p> My stepmother was waiting in a crowd of people . She was named Barbara : younger than my father , a dark-haired woman in her fifties , a writer for a feminist newsletter . In a previous decade she had been a lawyer , and she was still active in environmental and leftist causes , all of which did not keep her from more domestic accomplishments . She was a cook , a quiltmaker . In the crowd on the church steps she stood out , sleek in a dark cape and black leather boots  --  clothes which , despite their evident expense , nevertheless managed to bring some echo back from 1966 , when she had lived on a commune in Colorado . I walked up towards her , ignoring everybody so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hierarchy of bereavement . Tears glittered in her eyes ; she reached out black-gloved hands and grasped hold of my thumbs . What was there to say ? Not for me some vain condolence ; I leaned down towards her , conscious of her smell  --  was it patchouli oil ? Her almost poreless skin . <p> " Jack , " she said . " I 'm so happy you 're here . " She pulled me aside under the portal of the church . I shook my head . And it was lucky that my feelings were beyond words . Otherwise I might have been tempted to admit so much . I had not known , for example , that my father was a Lutheran . <p> " I 'd like you to say something , " she said . " There 'll be a time when some of the people who were closest to him ... I spoke to you about it over the phone . " <p> I remembered . I closed my eyes . " You probably brought something , " she went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read a poem . You know that poem he used to love  --  ' Pied Beauty . ' Hopkins always was his favorite poet . " <p> I nodded . Yet I felt cheated , too . The category of " favorite poet " was not one I was aware had existed in my father 's mind . Did this mean there might be other poets also , only slightly below Hopkins in his estimation ? Who were they ? Sappho ? John Ashbery ? Alexander Pope ? <p> " I 'd like that , " I said . <p> " I 'm so glad you could come , " she said again . <p> Half an hour later I found myself at the pulpit reading a poem . Sometimes my voice cracked with emotion  --  a reflex . Between the stanzas I looked out over the pews . There was a big crowd . My father had produced industrial films . Mostly he had worked as a consultant , and I guess he knew a lot of people . I guess he had a lot of friends . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what I saw from that pulpit . It is disjointed in my memory by the stanzas of the poem , and therefore it exists in my mind not as a continuum , but as a series of independent images . I used to examine them , searching for a clue . My father was a prominent man . There had been an obituary in the Los Angeles Times . Surely Jean-Jacques would have had a chance to see it , even if he had n't called my father 's office in the days after his death . How could he have kept away ? And so I used to examine those images in the church , over and over again as if they were a series of photographs  --  the faces , the sad bodies , the rows of pews . Surely he is there somewhere . For a while , when I was at my most compulsive , I did remember a figure lurking at the back . Now I do n't . Somebody once showed me how , in different editions of a history textbook , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to illustrate some subtle new idea . In a crowd of men , skins would darken , and then grow white again . Hair would grow longer , and then short again . Women would appear , then disappear . Memory is like history . At one time it was imperative for me to see the figure of a man , hiding in the back behind a white column . Handsome in his suit . Sometimes I could even see his crutch . Memory is like history  --  it absorbs the needs of the present . Now he 's vanished . <p> After the ceremony I went to a reception at my stepmother 's house , and I talked to some of my father 's friends . Once I was back in the kitchen , looking for more ice , and Barbara was there , fussing with some strawberry tarts . " Jack , " she said , " can you do something for me ? " <p> She looked toward the window and then back . " I was at your father 's office yesterday , clearing some stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got copies of everything and the rest can go . But I feel bad about asking Elaine or someone to throw it all away , without a family member at least looking through it . It 's all old files . " She looked at me and blinked , but I said nothing . <p> " I do n't have to explain , do I ? " she went on . " It tires me out . Your father was a wonderful man . I know it 's been hard for you sometimes , but you should understand  --  he really loved you . " <p> " I know that , " I said . <p> Then she was crying , and I went and put my arms around her . She was staring hard at one of the buttons of my shirt , inches from her eye . She balled up her fist and placed it carefully in the center of my chest . " It 's business stuff , " she said , after a pause . " The furniture 's all rented . Just make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a box as you go in . " <p> My father had died suddenly , of a heart attack . My stepmother had been taking a bath , and had heard him crying out . I pictured her naked , wet , shivering , her arms around his glossy head . <p> In her house there were no photographs of him . I had walked around during the reception , trying to find one . Barbara had had her picture taken with the Berrigan brothers , people like that . But nothing with my father ; in his office that evening , I picked a framed photograph out of the box by the door . <p> He shared space with some lawyer friends in a one-story professional building , not far from his house . I sat down at his desk with the photograph in my hands . It showed Barbara and him together . She was wearing a low-waisted dress . Her braid hung down her back . She turned toward him , smiling . <p> He , by contrast , looked raffish and unkempt . He stared towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His black hair was uncombed . He wore an Irish sweater and his big chest bulged importantly . <p> I propped the photograph on his blotter and sat looking at it for a little while . Why was his hair still so black ? Perhaps it was one of the things that had united him to Barbara  --  the fact that both of them had retained their natural hair color long after most people , my mother for example , had turned gray . I remembered searching his medicine cabinet for hair dye when I was about sixteen . I had found nothing . <p> It was cold in his office . I got up and pulled out a few drawers of his file cabinets , not knowing what to do . Everything was neatly labeled  --  copies of storyboards , records of old jobs . <p> Elaine , my father 's assistant , had showed me the dumpster in the parking lot when she had dropped me off . I started loading the files into some trash bags , which were already half full . At first I was conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark outside , and I turned on the light . <p> I threw out everything from one cabinet , but the bottom drawer was locked . My father had hired Elaine only two weeks before he died ; she had given me his keys , but she did n't know what locks they fit . I picked through the ring and then sat down again . <p> Now I can say I knew it , I knew it , I knew I had found something . And maybe Barbara , testing that drawer , had felt the same thing . Maybe that was why she 'd gone away , unable to proceed . Memories of feelings are so colored by the lights thrown back on them ; here , now , I can be sure I knew . I searched for the key for almost an hour . The window to the parking lot was completely dark when I found it , hanging from a nail in the closet , high up above the door frame . I knew as soon as I touched it what it was . <p> Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first I leafed impatiently through the models ' head shots in the first part of the drawer . There was nothing distinctive about them except for the neatness with which they were arranged  --  Male/Blonde , Female/Blonde , Male/Dark , Female/Dark  --  each category in a separate hanging folder . <p> But the drawer slid out and out . There were short stories in manuscript , creased in thirds , as if they had been sent through the mail . I thumbed through them , looking for the seamy parts  --  one was full of hard homosexual imagery . It was a story about a father chastising his young son . <p> I found a manilla envelope containing pages and pages of small notations , all in my father 's printing . " F.H. , 11/2/79 , 1pm ? #3 only "  --  the dates went back fifteen years . More photographs in another envelope , snapshots this time . All women , all ages , some naked , most not . I recognized some people from the funeral , also Elaine . She was standing in the woods , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two folders in the drawer contained letters from a single correspondent , and what looked liked copies of my father 's replies . At first I was excited , and repulsed also to find myself in such company  --  the first file was labeled " Letters : Jack . " There were hundreds of them , and it took me a while to decide that they were not from me . <p> My fathers ' contained no salutation or signature , just a solid block of text , often without paragraphs . The other man sometimes wrote by hand ; the first letters were in a childish script , and they were difficult to read . Difficult even to glance at  --  I leafed forward to the spring of 1982 , when he started using a typewriter . He said , " Dear Jerry , " which had been my father 's nickname . Once : " Dear Father . " Once " Dear Dad . " One was signed , " Your loving son . " " Your loving son , Jack . " <p> This was a game they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-believe father , a make-believe son . " Dear Dad , " one letter read . " I 'm happy to have got the chance to see you when you were in town . I 'm still excited from your visit , and I do n't have so much to say , only that I 'm glad you had a chance to see the apartment , and see I was not being so extravagant . I know you will always think I spend my money on expensive things , so I 'm glad you could be with me and share my life , if only for one night . Next time you should stay for longer . Dinner was delicious . I have n't had a meal like that since the semester started . " <p> The box by the door included an unopened phone bill ; I had seen it as I came in . My stepmother had put it there , intending , I suppose , to pay it later . I retrieved it now and cut it open  --  pages of long-distance calls , many to a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same phone , sometimes twice a day . <p> I sat back in my father 's chair . And this is the part I do n't remember well  --  I sat there a long time . I 'd like to think that I was shocked , disgusted , hurt , but I do n't think it 's true . Only I was looking at my father 's phone , imagining his hand on the receiver , his lips so close to it  --  how many times ? Nothing remained of any words that he had said . There was no mark on the plastic  --  I do n't remember dialing the number , but then I was letting it ring until an answering machine picked up . " This is 964-3187 , " it said . " If you 'd like to leave a message for Jean-Jacques Brauner , please do so after the beep . " <p> I hung up and continued reading . The last folder was labeled , " Letters : Jack ( II ) . " And then , as if an afterthought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in my father 's intolerably precise hand . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Jacques wrote in 1987 . " I know how angry you are . But I just wish you 'd say it instead of brooding . If I was there you could just show me and get it over with , but I 'm not , so you 'll just have to . ... " <p> To which my father had answered : " I think you 're making a mistake . Eric is your boss ; he 's the one that you should worry about . Joanne 's not in a position to harm you , so her opinion does n't matter . I know you always want to accommodate everyone , but it 's a trait that gets less charming as you age . You may pretend you 're trying to be nice , but really , it 's a form of insecurity and self-hate . I 'm telling you this because I know ... " <p> When my father was dying , when he was actually dying in my stepmother 's arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this file of letters , sitting in his chair ? Or Barbara ? " I 'm sorry to hear about Barbara 's operation , " Jacques wrote in 1989 . " It must be very depressing to her . No matter how much you try to convince yourself that these things are n't important , it alters the way you think of yourself , like wrinkles , or losing your hair , though of course much worse . It 's funny , it feels like I know her very well , enough to reassure you that I know she 'll be all right , and that you 're worrying about nothing . ... " <p> I dialed the Oakland number again . The man 's voice was pleasant , his intonation slightly strange , not quite American , perhaps . After the beep I said , " Listen , this is Jack Modine . I do n't know how to say this , and maybe you already know , but my father had a heart attack on Thursday morning . I just wanted to tell you , and to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want them forwarded to my stepmother . As I say , it was very sudden , and he was n't in any pain . " <p> I paused for a moment  --  it seemed so strange . I also have a tendency to accommodate , not that my father had ever remarked on it . " Do n't worry about anything , " I said . " I 'm telling you because I guess you cared about him . If you want to know more , I 'll be home after the fifteenth . My number is ... , " I said , and I gave him the number of my apartment in Meridan . <p> I called him again a few weeks later and then a few times after that . I never got the answering machine again , and I never said anything either . I would just listen to him go , " Hello ? Hello ? " and then he would hang up . After a while he disconnected his phone . But I can remember at least one time , when I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialed his number just to listen to the recorded message from the phone company . <p> I look back on that from a life which is , if not happy , at least regular , at least full of a routine . And it contains , I feel sure , some of the ingredients of happiness . Now I am able to isolate them  --  friends . Sex . Work . I have hopes that someday I will learn to mix them in correct proportions . But I was desperate then , and part of the reason was that everything I had discovered about my father seemed unreal so quickly . I threw it all into the dumpster . The unknown , beating heart of my father 's life  --  I threw it in the garbage . I did n't even read most of the letters . Late that same night I got up from the bed in my hotel and got dressed . I had some idea of finding the bus station and waiting there until morning , but instead I walked around the streets of Santa Monica , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to look over his letters again . I wanted to go through them and read over where he mentioned me  --  I remembered once I went out to visit him and Barbara . He came down into the kitchen at three o'clock in the morning to find me watching TV , and he took me to an all-night hamburger stand somewhere . " The best egg creams in California , " he said . Surely , I thought , he would have told Jacques about that . I remembered the date , or at least the year . <p> I did n't find the office again . The vial of ashes Barbara gave me  --  I threw it away too . By the time I got back to Meridan that phone number in Oakland was the only thing left , and when I found out it had been disconnected , I felt as if some essential link had been destroyed . A link to urgent knowledge  --  now it seems obvious . Now it seems easy to say where my trouble really started . In the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , I began to imagine a whole world . <p> And the moving spirit of that world was Jean-Jacques Brauner . From the beginning , of course , I had been thinking about him , trying to make a picture of him in my mind . Or rather , not trying  --  the picture came by itself , and I found myself looking at it , hour after hour . It was so clear , I began to think it must be founded on something , some snapshot in my father 's file that I could n't quite remember . It took me a long time to realize that the model for the picture was myself . I am five-eleven . Jean-Jacques was six feet . I am handsome . Jean Jacques was beautiful . Men and women turned to look at him when he walked past . <p> The foreign name , the hint of foreignness in the voice on the tape , I thought , must be an affectation , the residue from a privileged childhood spent abroad  --  he did n't really need the money that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college ? Some expensive school , Berkeley , perhaps . No doubt he had graduated near the top of his class . No doubt he had won prizes , cash prizes which gave him the time and the prestige to pick and choose among employers . Whereas I had gone to the University of Connecticut and my mother had paid . A second-rate B.A. with third-rate grades  --  it was hard for me to find anything . I had a job in a health club for six dollars an hour . <p> This sounds carping and resentful , but in fact I did not envy his success . He was too far away . In the morning I would watch the weather channel , and it never rained in Oakland . The temperature was always fifty-seven degrees . I had never been there , but in my mind 's eye I pictured it , conveniently located atop the San Andreas Fault , midway between Yosemite National Park and the stupefying beauty of Big Sur . The capital of a new and perfect California , where fathers loved their sons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-paying jobs . How could I begrudge Jacques anything ? He was my counterpart , my double in that uncorrupted world . <p> And yet there must have been some conduit between that world and this , because from time to time I would catch sight of him . Not at first . At first all I noticed was a tension in the air , a sudden electricity . At certain moments in the street in Meridan , during my lunch hour perhaps , I would feel a new small sensitivity . I would know Jean-Jacques was thinking about me , that our thoughts were colliding like cold and hot fronts over Kansas . Colliding but not mixing  --  frustrated , later , by our lack of communication , I began to imagine that he was leaving me clues . Arrangements of sticks , of trash , junk mail , graffiti on the street , all seemed like messages in a language I could not decode . <p> But I 'm going too fast . These delusions came gradually . And always there was part of me that was still rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerobics instructor at the health club where I worked before I was let go . I told him a suspicion I had that my father was still alive , that he had faked his death , faked his cremation , fooled his wife and all his creditors , and was living in the Bay Area . It was just a theory . I had not come to any definite conclusion , and I was weighing the evidence with Servando , and listening to him carefully when he said it was unlikely , that it probably was n't true . I believed him . I was reassured . But then I got to thinking about it later in the week , and it occurred to me that maybe Servando was n't necessarily disinterested , that maybe he had received a letter from Jean-Jacques , or maybe some message in one of the arrangements of objects that I was finding so difficult to interpret . It drove me crazy , the idea that everything around me was so pregnant with information that might change my life , and yet I could n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the LSAT 's . I had been fired from my job after an argument with the desk manager . I think I was probably in the wrong . Maybe I even told her that  --  in any case , she did n't hold a grudge . She arranged for me to receive unemployment . At the same time I got a letter from my father 's lawyer , saying that I had been left a legacy of $15,000 . The lawyer 's name was Mr. Ordauer ; he also said that my father 's estate would defray the expense of any further education  --  it was a nice letter , and I liked the language , the formal phrases . It made me want to follow in Mr. Ordauer 's footsteps . I knew being a lawyer was a good job , perhaps a better job than anything Jean-Jacques had yet achieved . I called Mr. Ordauer on the phone . " Listen , " I said , " was there another legacy ? Did my father leave anything to a man named Brauner , in Oakland ? " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said without hesitating . " He left no money to his business associates . " <p> How wonderful a gift , I thought , to be able to lie so effortlessly ! So I signed up to take the LSAT 's at the University of Connecticut , and I bought some training books . And when I was studying them I realized that this was definitely what I was intended to do with my life  --  I knew every answer to every question in the sample tests without any problem at all . Those questions about the couples square-dancing , and who 's next to whom . I just knew it ; I could see them spinning around , coming to rest . <p> As I say , I had never wished Jean-Jacques any harm . But I could tell now that he was worried , anxious , jealous of me . Jealous of my closeness with my father , who would be sending me to law school  --  I guess he decided he had to come back East and do something , because it was about that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . As I say , I had some idea that he had been at my father 's funeral , but I could n't be sure . He was lurking behind a pillar . I had n't seen his face . The first time I saw it , I was walking down Orange Street in New Haven , and there was a beautiful dark-haired man in front of me . His right leg was bandaged , and he was swinging himself along on crutches . He turned back to look at me . <p> I had gone to New Haven to visit an old friend . He had seemed concerned and upset that I was sleeping so badly ; the conversation was disagreeable , and so I left . <p> I was walking back to where I 'd parked my car when I saw this man , and even then I did n't think much about it . I just noticed his beauty , his dark eyebrows and his dark eyes . His fat soft mouth . But it was n't until I saw the same man in Meridan , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was . Almost I went up to him . Almost I confronted him . He smiled at me and made a minute gesture with his hand . I thought , I wo n't play into his game . It 's not just out of chance that he allowed me to see him . He wants something from me . <p> I turned around and walked away from him . But I could feel his eyes . And I could feel his presence around me , the next day and the next . During the weeks before the test , I was tormented by a series of absurd accidents . Once , an egg fell on the sidewalk just in front of me . Once , a dog barked all night , just when I was finally able to rest . I 'm not saying that even at the time I held him responsible for these events . I ca n't picture him limping along the rooftops , an egg in his hand . I ca n't picture him dragging a dog to sit outside my room , inciting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself deflected and distracted by bad luck , just when it was most important for me to concentrate . To rest , to gather my resources , but always , every day there was something . My landlord raised my rent . I twisted my foot , stepping off the curb in front of my apartment . I sat down , holding my leg , tears in my eyes , and I could feel that sudden tension in the air . And though I could n't see him anywhere in the street , especially not through eyes blurred by tears , I could feel his presence . Not that I blamed him  --  it had been my own stupidity , my own clumsiness . But in a way that made it worse  --  he was using my own worst flaws against me . He was making it impossible for me to hate anyone but myself . <p> But still , I refused to let myself be deflected . I studied the training books over and over . I memorized the responses . I could feel the tension growing all around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nervous . I got into my car . And I had had trouble driving for a few days  --  there was something wrong with my spacial perception , and I was always afraid that I was getting too close to things . Streets I had driven down a thousand times seemed narrow , and I was concerned that I might scrape the paint off cars parked along the curb . So I drove slowly , carefully , anxious when cars approached me in the opposite direction . Anxious when people passed me , or honked at me from behind . <p> That morning I had dressed in my suit . I was taking time with everything . I had given myself fifty minutes for the drive , but when I looked at my watch , I saw I had to hurry . I was out in the country by that time , driving past a golf course . It was separated from the highway by a guard rail and a steep embankment . There was a strip where you could pull over . And when I looked at my watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment  --  I admit it . It 's not as if he ran in front of the car ; he was just standing with his crutches in the breakdown lane when I hit him . <p> I pulled over as quickly as I could and then just waited for a while . I left the car running , because I was still in a hurry . More than ever , in fact . An hour later I would blame myself by thinking that even in this matter of life and death I could be cursory and careless , just like the other cars that were rushing past me without stopping . But when I got out and looked at the bumper , there was no mark . I walked back down the strip , trying to find him , and I could n't . <p> Yet I had seen him clearly , standing with his crutches . His dark hair , dark eyes . I had felt the shudder in the car as he slid off the front bumper . <p> But I did n't know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had been mistaken . As I thought about it more , standing in the hot morning by the side of the road , it seemed more likely  --  what would he have been doing here ? How had he gotten here ? How could he have known that I would come this way ? It was absurd . I went back to my car and drove to the test site without stopping . I was prepared  --  I had my pencils and my clock . I went in and we sat in rows , and I listened impatiently to the instructions . We were in the basement of Monteith Hall , and it was well lit down there . They passed out the test booklets , and then we started . The first section was analogies  --  it was harder than the sample I had practiced with , and I could feel myself making a few errors . But that did nothing to shake my confidence . It would have been silly to expect to perform perfectly , especially after such a disturbing incident in the car . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of meaning , even though it was hot in Monteith Hall that morning . I finished the section exactly on time . <p> But after a while I found it harder to concentrate , because I was thinking about Jean-Jacques . What if he was still there by the side of the road , and I had n't seen him for some reason ? Maybe I had dragged him underneath my car . Or maybe he had rolled down the embankment , or been thrown over the guard rail . I had been going almost forty miles an hour . <p> This was in the middle of the quantitative section . Ordinarily , it would have been so easy for me , except I could n't concentrate . It was all pie charts and parabolas  --  basic stuff , but I was wondering if I could be arrested for leaving the scene of an accident . I wondered whether I 'd been seen . So that when they told us to stop , I was n't finished . And that was my best section  --  the next one was analytical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't believe it . I just stared at the question . <p> After ten minutes , I closed my booklet . I left the pencils but I took the clock and walked out , back to my car . There was no mark on it anywhere , but even so I got in and drove back to the golf course . I thought maybe he had rolled down into some bushes near the road , or maybe he had been injured , and had managed to drag himself away into the trees . There was a copse of trees near the ninth green ; I parked my car near the guard rail and climbed down the embankment . I thought maybe I would find his crutch . I poked a stick into a bush , looking for his crutches , and then I walked across the green and through the copse . I sat down on a bench on the other side , and I watched some people set up their tees . A man in a red shirt and beige pants hit a long , straight ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it occurred to me that Jean-Jacques had tricked me . And maybe he had n't even been there , maybe he had never left California , but even so he had tricked me , and robbed me again . It occurred to me that he had stolen my life from me as he had stolen my father 's love . That he had stolen my life , that he was living it and enjoying it , while I was sitting on this bench . I was sitting alone on the white bench , watching the man in the beige pants trudge down the hill . It was a hot , bright morning . <p> After a while , I got up to follow him . And I thought , it 's something just to be able to get up and walk . It 's something just to climb up an embankment and sit in the front seat of your car . I sat there with my hands gripping the steering wheel . I closed my eyes , and for a blissful moment I could n't remember why I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in Santa Monica . The fluorescent lighting overhead . The dark window and the parking lot . But this time it was different . This time a single hour had been excised from my memory , cleansing what had gone before , cleansing for a blissful moment what came afterward . Suddenly I could n't remember whether the file cabinet had five drawers or only four . Or else the bottom drawer was locked , and I tried , and tried , and failed to pull it open . <p> Simultaneously , perhaps in order to replace that excised hour , I remembered something new . I slid forward on the car seat . I pulled my wallet out of my back pocket and retrieved from it a letter , written years before and never sent . I unfolded it carefully , for it was worn along the creases . " Dear Dad , " it said . And then in part : " I hate you . I hate you for every bad choice I ever made . " <p> People talk so carelessly about how life gets better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be brave , they say , be strong . People connect the two . But in the real world they are opposites . They never go together . Strong people are like tank commanders driving through a field of bones . No courage is involved . Courage is the virtue of the weak . <p> After a while , I buckled on my seat belt . I turned on the ignition and drove home . I went indoors and lay down on my bed . All that time when I was growing up , before my father moved to California  --  there was no reason to remember what he did , or what he did n't do . Only later , in my mother 's kitchen . Once she said : " He did the best he could . He just was n't cut out for it . He did n't have the instinct to protect . " Once she said , with no lightness whatever in her tone : " You used to bring out the worst in him . " <p> Shortly after his death , Barbara had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were home movies taken at my mother 's house . I did n't have access to a projector ; all I could do was hold them to the light . Now I took the roll from my bedside table and untaped the end . I sat up on my bed and held a strip of film up to the window . It showed a man about my age , sitting cross-legged in the grass , holding up a baby . <p> I pulled six or eight feet of film down between my thumbs . The image did n't seem to change . <p>
