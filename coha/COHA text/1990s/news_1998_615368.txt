<p> As the House approaches a decision on whether to impeach President Clinton , the few undecided lawmakers are getting little help by Clinton 's refusal to say he lied and the Republican leadership 's rejection of an alternative censure vote . " We 're as conflicted as America is , " said Rep. Billy Tauzin ( R-La. ) , one of some two dozen swing votes who will decide late this week whether the House will send articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial . House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde ( R-Ill. ) , who will lead the impeachment fight on the floor , suggested one way out  --  Clinton 's resignation . Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay , both of Texas , concurred , but the president said he had " no intention " of quitting . " It 's re-write the book on partisanship , the Republican leadership calling for the president to resign when he is doing the nation 's business , " White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today while traveling with the president in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of impeachment approved last week by the House Judiciary Committee . They include two counts of perjury , one of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power in the Monica Lewinsky matter . Clinton hopes to persuade undecided Republicans that his affair with the former White House intern should receive public censure but does not rise to the level of impeachment . But in Jerusalem on Sunday he again insisted that he did not commit perjury in his testimony about the relationship . <p> " I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not do , " he said at a Jerusalem news conference dominated by questions on impeachment . The statement appeared to anger potential supporters in the House . " If the president 's trying to throw himself on the mercy of the court , you have to admit your guilt , " said Rep. Scott Klug ( R-Wis. ) , who appeared Sunday with Tauzin on NBC 's " Meet the Press . " Clinton 's refusal to admit he lied " just kind of leaves us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another undecided , said on ABC 's " This Week . " Acknowledgement of perjury would leave Clinton open to criminal prosecution after he leaves office . Democrats have been pushing for a vote on censure , a means to publicly condemn Clinton without removing him from office . That also would provide an alternative for wavering Republicans who are leery of impeachment but do n't want the president to get off without punishment . " It 's a comfortable way to put this behind us and everybody is chafing under the irritation of this burden , " said Hyde , who on Saturday led Republicans in rejecting an attempt by Democrats on the panel to bring a censure vote to the floor . But , " It just is n't right in terms of the Constitution , " said Hyde , who appeared on CBS ' " Face the Nation " and ABC . <p> Hyde said polls showing the public does not want Clinton removed from office do not matter . <p> " This may be naive and stupid and probably both , but I just think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience and matters of principle , " he said . The 74-year old Illinois Republican said , " Look , if Jesus Christ had taken a poll , he would never have preached the Gospel . " In letters to Hyde on Saturday , retiring House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) and Speaker-designate Bob Livingston ( R-La. ) agreed that a censure vote should not be permitted . DeLay , the Republican whip , said on NBC that even if a censure resolution got to the floor it could be defeated because some Democrats would vote against any sanction of Clinton . Nevertheless , Minority Leader Dick Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) said Democrats will use various procedural tactics to force lawmakers to decide whether a censure vote is appropriate . " So they 're going to have to face this issue , whether the Republican leadership wants them to or not , " he said . White House chief of staff John Podesta said the final vote on impeachment was still too close to call . " Things are a little bit up for grabs , " he told CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning that at least 14 of the 228 Republicans in the 435-member House would have to vote no for impeachment to be defeated . Only about five Republicans have said publicly that they oppose impeachment . " The odds are fairly strong that the House will vote for impeachment , " Rep. Charles Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , a Judiciary Committee member and senator-elect , said on CNN . Even if impeachment is approved , polls indicate a solid majority of Americans wants Clinton to remain in office . It also is considered unlikely that the Senate would find the two-thirds majority needed to convict and remove Clinton from office . " It is very unpleasant to swim against the tide , " Hyde said , adding that the sentiment against impeachment " makes us look like we are kind of strange and out of step with the mainstream . " But he said lying under oath was an impeachable offense and " I think the rule of law is worth putting the country through this . " Hyde reiterated that Clinton should resign , saying it would " save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make him " the savior of his party . " " He would be welcomed around the country at groups who would love to hear him speak , " Hyde said . " It would be a way of going out with honor . If he does n't , it 's hard to predict what the consequences are . " Similarly , DeLay said " I would just hope that the president would put the American people ahead of his own ambitions and resign , " and Armey said he would have resigned " long ago " under the same circumstances . Clinton , at his news conference , said emphatically that he had " no intention of resigning . " The idea " never crossed my mind , " he declared . The House is to formally receive the four articles of impeachment and an accompanying report from the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning . The full House is to begin debating Clinton 's impeachment and removal from office Thursday at 10 a.m . <p> Although House leaders have yet to negotiate how many hours will be set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberations could spill over into Friday . The House will take separate votes on each of the four articles of impeachment . It will be only the second time in history the full House has been called on to consider the impeachment of a president . Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in the Watergate scandal 24 years ago before a House vote . Andrew Johnson was impeached and saved from removal from office by one vote after a Senate trial in 1868 . <p> Clinton 's remarks Sunday remained consistent with his defense before a grand jury last Aug. 17 , when he denied he had lied in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case by saying he had not had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky . Underpinning that August testimony was the idea  --  repeated by Clinton 's lawyers in their summations before the House Judiciary Committee last week  --  that the president was intentionally trying to mislead his inquisitors in the Jones case while staying on the right side of the legal line between not helping his accusers and perjuring himself . " Now , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clinton said Sunday . " Yes , it was . That 's exactly what I said in the grand jury testimony , myself . " While that argument might well serve as a defense in an actual perjury prosecution , it has infuriated Republicans who charge that the president has undermined the rule of law . Rep. Scott Klug ( R-Wis. ) said , on Sunday , " It 's the same thing we 've heard : I did n't , I did n't , I did n't . And I think everybody realizes he did .
