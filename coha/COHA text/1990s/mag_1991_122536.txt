Waiting for a Ferry // After being picked second in the 1989 draft by the Clippers ; after playing a season in Italy in order to force L.A. to unload him ; after being acquired by the Cavaliers , who swapped guard Ron Harper , two first-round draft choices and a second-rounder to get him ; and after signing a deal with the Cavs potentially worth , with incentives , $34 million over 10 years , Danny Fern ' entered his rookie year saddled with great expectations . Thus far , the 6 ' 10 " Ferry has labored under those expectations , averaging 8.6 points ( on 44.7% shooting ) and 3.0 rebounds in 19.9 minutes per game . He has often appeared a step slow , indecisive on offense and prone to fouls on defense . // " I think it 's been real tough for Danny , " says Celtics guard Brian Shaw , who was Ferry 's teammate on Il Messaggero Roma last season . " Over in Italy , he was being compared to me , and I had already played one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone forgets he 's a rookie . He was compared to Larry Bird when he first came into the league . I can tell you from playing in Boston , those are really big shoes to fill . " // Few people in the NBA are ready to write Ferry off , though few are sure he 's worth his high price tag , either . " I think he 's improved some , " says Indiana coach Bob Hill . " But he 's going to constantly play under the shadow of all that money , and I do n't know if he 'll ever live up to it . " Adds Atlanta assistant coach Kevin Loughery , " Danny is one of those kids who is very critical of himself , and that 's hurt his confidence sometimes . I really thought he would be an outstanding player in this league ; I thought he would be big time . Now , it may not happen because confidence can be destroyed very easily in the NBA. " // Because he had been dividing his time among all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat , although he has been playing mostly at power forward recently . He has also been bothered by tendinitis in the left knee . The Cavalier coaching staff has broken down reels of film for him to study , and Ferry says his teammates have been extremely encouraging , even if the Cleveland fans have not been . " I think I 'm starting to understand the game  --  where I can get my shot , how to read the offenses , the opportunities off the double team , the defensive rotations , " Ferry says . " But it 's been a roller coaster . I 'll have a stretch of good games , then some bad games . It 's been a year of small steps for me . This summer I 'll know what I need to work on so I can make a big step next year .

" // Happy Camper // Do n't tell Doug Moe that retirement is all that bad . Moe , who was fired by the Nuggets on Sept. 6 after 10 seasons as the team 's coach , says , " I 'm doing what I do best  --  nothing . " // Moe has a contract settlement that pays him about $200,000 a year for the next 10 years , plus a new Cadillac each of the next three years and $10,000 annually for country club fees . He says it will take a huge offer  --  " about a million a year "  --  to lure him back as a head coach . // First , a comeback would mean he would have to fly again , which he dreads . Second , a return would interrupt his childhood dream . " The day I got fired , I thought of spring training , " he says . An ardent baseball fan , Moe arrived in Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different spring training camp each day . When told that a lot of baseball fans probably envy him , Moe said , " Hell , I envy me. " // TV , or not TV ? // Commissioner David Stern has long believed that when it comes to television , less is more . When there 's a glut of televised games , it 's harder to draw audiences and advertising dollars , particularly on network telecasts  --  a lesson learned painfully last summer by Major League Baseball and CBS . This partly explains why Stern last week had league attorneys file an appeal with the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court in Chicago of a decision the NBA lost Jan. 24 to superstation WGN. // Until last April , the league-imposed maximum for games allowed to be shown on the superstations  --  WGN in Chicago , WTBS in Atlanta and WOR in New Jersey  --  was 25 per season . At that time the NBA Board of Governors voted to lower the figure to 20 for 1990-91 , and it was reported to be considering decreasing the number each year in five-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , U.S. District Court Judge Hubert L. Will said that the reduction from 25 to 20 games was " a significant restraint of trade " and would " reduce availability and competition in hope of raising the price in the future . " // The superstations were naturally delighted with Will 's ruling , which would protect their right to telecast a significant number of games , and , they believe , stave off the possibility of copycat cutbacks by the NCAA and Major League Baseball . But the NBA fears that the decision would reduce the league 's value to a network and damage the financial condition of weaker teams that depend on national TV revenues . League officials suggest that Will 's ruling would further dilute the product by encouraging the development of additional superstations built around popular teams . // And how does all this affect the fan ? Cutting out the superstations would leave viewers only two places to watch nationally televised games  --  NBC and TNT , which between them now show 72 regular-season games plus the playoffs . But that could change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to going to pay-per-view . " To do that , you really have to have tight control of the product , " the executive said . " David Stern runs the NBA with a very proprietary approach and with a firm hand . " But Will 's ruling has loosened Stern 's grip , at least for now . // The H-O-R-S-E Powers // When George ( Iceman ) Gervin retired in 1986 , he took with him not only four NBA scoring titles , but also an unofficial honor as well : Player Most Likely to Inflict an E in H-O-R-S-E , a game in which competitors must match each other 's shots . " He could make more shots from behind the backboard than anyone I 've ever seen , " recalls Spur vice-president Bob Bass . " He 'd sit down in the second row of scats and bank them in . " But there were other H-O-R-S-E hotshots of yore , and Gervin particularly admired the late Pete Maravich , who used to spin the ball on one finger , toss it into the air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play more jump-shot shooting games , " says Gervin. // Still , top H-O-R-S-E players do exist in the NBA . Among the best are Houston guard Kenny Smith , whose repertoire includes over-the-head shots from behind the basket and from half-court while sitting down ; Phoenix swingman Dan Majerle , who is deadly on 40-foot set shots from the bench ; Boston reserve Michael Smith , who can hit bank shots off the 24-second clock ; and Portland guard Danny Ainge , a manic player who once won a two-hour-long shooting duel with then Celtics teammate Sam Vincent when he made a shot standing on a chair behind press row in Milwaukee . // But the current H-O-R-S-E shoo-in is Chris Mullin of Golden State . " He 's not going to make up as many shots as some other guys , " says Warrior guard Kevin Pritchard . " But he 's not going to miss anything you come up with , either . " // The Bulls ' Market // During timeouts at Chicago Stadium , hard rock blares while Benny the Bull and the Luvabulls frolic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes on an organ . But for all their subtle differences , both old-time arenas house some of the most rabid fans in the league . Our poll this week set out to determine whose fans were more boisterous and therefore harder for opponents to take . // It was close . From the teams that responded , Chicago 's fans got nine votes , Boston 's eight . Said Indiana 's Hill , giving his vote to the Bulls ' rabble , " Chicago is louder . Boston gets loud , too , but its fans seem to be more sophisticated . " Agrees Bass , " Chicago 's got the noisiest fans of those two  --  the noisiest in the league . " Bass adds , " In all these new arenas you just do n't get that same noise . " // One of those who voted for Boston , an Atlantic Division coach , drew this distinction : " The Boston fan is more rabid ; the Chicago fan is more forgiving . The Chicago fan is almost the ideal fan ; the Boston fan is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
