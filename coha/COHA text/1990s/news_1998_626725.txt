<p> Ken Starr : villain or hero ? <p> The story of Susan McDougal and special counsel Kenneth Starr ( Chronicle , May 10 ) was worthy in its depiction of how absolute power corrupts . All fair-minded Americans should share the pain and the agony of McDougal and her brother , a Houston high school teacher . <p> Why are n't disgusted Americans raising funds for the defense of Starr 's victims , instead of watching the attorneys and the anti-Clinton cronies amassing for their wrong-headed agenda ? <p> Starr enjoys the power of an absolute monarch , the same type that most Americans abandoned when they left Europe . His fanatical attempt to bring down a president who has ushered this great economic miracle and peace among the races is unforgivable . He has ignored the will of the people in his zeal to bring President Clinton down . <p> Those who champion Starr for ideological or other reasons are doing irreparable damage to the psyche of America . Starr should be fired . <p> Dale Solomon , Houston <p> I am amazed at the insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal media and much of the ignorant public swallow the Clinton line so easily . <p> The May 12 article by Steven Gillon from the University of Oklahoma ( " Starr investigation threatens to create historical gap " ) concluded , " It would be unfortunate if in his zeal to uncover White House wrongdoings , the special prosecutor robbed future generations of the rich texture of our past . " <p> What ? Is it now the policeman 's fault when the criminal breaks the law ? How does a professor of history fall victim to such backward logic ? <p> Gillon is trying to blame Starr for the unwillingness of Bill Clinton and his staff to keep notes and diaries that can be used for historical references . Somehow , it is Starr 's fault that White House conversations are dominated by criminal issues and therefore must not be recorded for fear of incriminating the Clintons and their staff ? <p> This " historian " should be noting that despite the media and democratic spin during the last two presidential elections , President Clinton has demonstrated that character does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant of the White House distract the executive office from its constitutional responsibilities . The lack of character on display by Clinton destroys American idealism and confidence in the righteousness of our institutions . <p> Stephen Thomas , College Station <p> It 's painfully obvious that Newt Gingrich , R-Ga. , and his cohorts are involved in an effort to force President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore out of office so that Gingrich , as third-in-line for the presidency as speaker of the House , can capture the presidency without having to face the scrutiny of an election . Note the heightened activity on the part of the GOP and the right-wing groups . <p> Gingrich has even changed his physical appearance and resorted to caustic language in order to present Clinton as an arch criminal , setting himself up as judge and jury even when a lengthy investigation has turned up zilch . <p> He and his supporters will go to any length to get control of the White House . I think we are in for a constitutional crisis based on a power grab . <p> Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page column , May 11 , " McDougal is lone heroine in Whitewater " : Susan McDougal - some heroine . She 's a convicted felon in Arkansas , under felony indictment in California for nonrelated Whitewater charges , thumbs her nose at the U.S. judicial system and continues to libel special prosecutor Kenneth Starr by saying he wants her to lie . I say throw away the key . <p> Barb Daniel , Spring <p> Although the Republicans deride the first lady 's comments about the conservative conspiracy attempting to take down the current administration , their actions continue to prove the veracity of her words . It does n't take a NASA rocket scientist to notice the coordination and timing of the attacks . <p> This is not a conservative conspiracy , it is an all-out , sustained political barrage , lasting the entire length of Bill Clinton 's term in office . There is no justice sought here , only an outrageous manipulation of the legal system for partisan gain . <p> Pete Peterson , Houston <p> Bilingual program is fallacious <p> Four experts expressed their opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call them experts because they spoke with authority about their own personal experiences with learning to speak English . <p> One came to the United States from Mexico at the age of 17 and immersed himself among people who spoke nothing but English because he perceived that would be the quickest way to succeed . He learned to speak English in two months because he did not use his native language as a crutch . <p> Today , both he and his preschool child are bilingual , which is great . He did not take one or two years to learn English , as some public school educators seem to feel is required . <p> The other experts were also critical of our public school system for continuing a bilingual program that tries to teach English by grouping the children in classes , thus allowing them to continue speaking their native tongue in their group . <p> The educators claim they do not want to " push " the children by putting them with English-speaking groups of children , as this might affect the students adversely . This has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children to learn a new language . It wastes some very valuable learning time . <p> But , of course , more money comes to the school under the present plan , so we should just forget that the children are damaged in the process - just get the money . Shame on the perpetrators of this fallacious program . <p> Grayson L. Moss , Bellaire <p> Sight to behold downtown <p> The opening of Sesquicentennial Park was a sight to behold . Bayou Place continues to grow in popularity and the new ballpark will bring even more excitement . Combined with the opening of new restaurants and nightclubs , the growing energy of downtown Houston is becoming contagious . My wife and I make downtown part of our weekly entertainment plans . All that 's left to tie it all together is the Cotswold Project . Downtown will be a place all Houstonians can be proud of . Make it happen , Mayor Brown . <p> Byron Webb , Katy <p> Clean up your workplace <p> Re : Kirk Douglas ' desire to " do something " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Medal of Freedom and his scolding of the naughty tabloid press ' preoccupation with politicians ' private conduct ( Outlook , May 10 , " ' Tabloid Era ' leaves mess to clean up " ) , I applaud his desire to do something for our country . <p> But there is no need for him to sacrifice himself to politics and expose himself to the nosy tabloids . He can stay right where he is and still do a great service for his country . <p> If he would make movies that reject violence , profanity and overt sexual conduct and , instead , employ his talents in producing movies featuring men and women who are not surgically enhanced , who use beautiful language to speak noble thoughts , who engage in conduct that is civilized , self-sacrificing and concerned with the welfare of others , that would , indeed , be doing something for the country . <p> K.H.
