Each morning the Iraqi artillery begin to find their targets . Deep in the standing reeds where the gunners can not easily find them , black-robed women tend their children and few remaining buffalo in tiny makeshift clearings , while men , armed with old AK-47 assault rifles , crouch in hidden blinds along the waterways , waiting for Iraqi patrols . Only at nightfall , when the government troops return to their bases , can the men creep back to their families to sleep . <P> Saddam Hussein 's writ does not extend over the 6,800 sq . mi. of marsh that covers southern Iraq . There Shi'ite army deserters and Marsh Arabs who rose in rebellion after Iraq 's defeat in the Gulf War carry on their fight against Saddam . But they fear that their struggle may be doomed now that Baghdad has undertaken the systematic despoliation of the age-old Shi'ite sanctuary in the marshes . Over the past 20 months , according to captured documents and engineering plans now trickling out of Iraq , the government has nearly completed work on a huge project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will sap the water from the reeds and open the isolated rebel - strongholds to Iraqi tanks , possibly as early as this summer . " We no longer think of victory , " says a Shi'ite leader based in neighboring Iran . " Our rifles are no match for his tanks . If Saddam falls , it will have to be to someone else . We continue to fight simply because not to do so would mean certain death . " <P> Draining the swamps is only part of Saddam 's campaign to subdue the south . Iraqi military units have effectively encircled the area , enforcing a near total economic blockade and cutting off escape routes into Iran . Government artillery regularly bombards the marshes , and mines have been strewn across the landscape . Army forays into the villages bring terror to the 200,000 local Marsh Arabs . A captured Iraqi document details the elements of the siege : " the withdrawal of all foodstuffs , a ban on the sale of fish , prohibiting means of transportation to and from these areas . " The document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning of houses . <P> The 10,000 ill-equipped and ill-trained Shi'ite fighters have survived largely because of the protection offered by the terrain , with its floating reed islands and 20-ft. tall forests of papyrus and rushes . But once the swamps are dry , the rebels fear not only enemy tanks but also fires , which would push them into the arms of troops surrounding the perimeter . In February three blazes set by Iraqi barrages scorched several hundred square miles of marshland and destroyed dozens of villages . <P> Government officials insist the Saddam River project , a 350-mile canal linking Baghdad with the Shatt al-Arab waterway south of Basra , is intended only to add 1.5 million acres to Iraq 's arable land . Arif al-Delaimi , chief engineer on the project , says the southern portion of the canal was completed in the 1980s and the marshes have been drying up ever since . Instead of driving the inhabitants out , he says , the government has been resettling them around artificial lakes . But Andrew Whitley , executive director of Middle East Watch says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The project only makes sense as a political enterprise . "
