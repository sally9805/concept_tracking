<p> Working two jobs to make ends meet , Timothy Genest saw health insurance as a luxury he could n't afford . <p> But now the once-healthy computer technician , 31 , is hospitalized in Pompano Beach , Fla. , worried about a $ 25,000 bill that 's a week old and mounting daily . <p> With one leg paralyzed and 15 inches of surgical staples holding his stomach together , he has a new perspective on insurance : " When you 're sick is when you really find out how important it is to be healthy . " <p> Florida 's new health program - like reforms President Clinton will propose in May - will help people like Genest , who collided with a truck after his auto insurance lapsed . Like 2.5 million Floridians , he has no health insurance . <p> Dozens of other states - pinioned by the same budget crises and uninsured populations that are choking the federal system - are hurtling ahead with their own reforms . Fifteen states enacted reforms last year ; nearly two dozen more are debating them this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pool the purchasing power of individuals and businesses , making it among the first states to adopt what 's called managed competition . The White House health-care reform task force is working toward its own managed competition plan . <p> If Florida 's plan delivers what it promises - good insurance at an affordable price - Genest will insure himself and his son Jameson , 2 1/2 . <p> Doug Cook , director of Florida 's Agency for Health Care Administration , says Clinton 's task force is considering a timetable that would have states implementing its plan starting in 1995 , with full coverage by 1998 . <p> But to states caught in a budget vise , that 's forever . " Knowing Congress , we felt there might be a 2 to 3-year waiting period before the national plan is enacted , " says Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Brown . " We just could n't wait . " <p> Ira Magaziner , Clinton 's top health aide , says the White House plan will " have state flexibility , but it will also have certain national guidelines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statehouse domes are compatible with White House ideas : <p> Louisiana is considering a plan to create managed health-care organizations to contract with doctors and hospitals - a buy-in-bulk cost-cutting approach similar to that of the White House . Individuals would pay about $ 75 a month . <p> Oregon last month got federal permission for a program extending government-funded health care to more poor and disabled people by eliminating payment for some services . Some call that rationing - which the White House promises wo n't happen nationally . <p> New York Gov . Mario Cuomo has proposed regional health networks and may set doctors ' fees . No one is sure what will happen if state caps do n't match federal ones . <p> Kentucky is considering requiring employers to insure their workers or pay a payroll tax to cover the uninsured . The White House may just require all employers to provide health insurance . <p> Some states , like Louisiana , are trying to craft their reforms to conform with White House theories . Others worry their plans will be made obsolete by the national package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably next year at the earliest - some state experiments will have succeeded , others will have failed . Legislation will almost certainly be tinkered with to incorporate the best of the states ' ideas . <p> Clinton 's task force already is borrowing from state successes : Oregon , which developed priorities for basic benefits ; Minnesota 's pioneering efforts in managed competition ; Hawaii 's employer mandates . <p> The current White House plan for dealing with varying state programs : A new national health-care board will analyze state 's reforms and , if they meet minimum federal standards , grant them waivers . <p> Some governors want assurances they can go their own way . <p> " The federal government needs to set the basic benefit package , " says Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles . " The federal government needs to determine how we are going to bridge this ( Medicaid ) gap to make sure we have universal coverage . But then I think the federal government could allow the states some flexibility . " <p> Magaziner says the White House welcomes state experiments , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very few states that guarantee up front they 're going to insure everybody and they 're going to have a guaranteed benefits package . " <p> Because Florida 's approach is untested , no one knows how much the plan will save . It 's unclear what minimum benefits will be included . And the reforms wo n't be fully in place until 1995 - too late for its lessons to be of use to the White House . <p> Some state officials would prefer the Clinton administration hold off on its reform plans to give state incubators time to test new approaches . Clinton should " set a goal of full coverage by December 1995 and allow states to experiment , " says Cook . <p> The tension between Washington and states over health care is due in part to states ' - rights concerns that make governors traditionally wary of federally imposed programs . <p> " The primary responsibility of the federal government should be to figure out how to finance coverage for the uninsured , how to finance long-term care , " says Michael Dowling , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be responsible for figuring out how to organize the delivery of care . " <p> Then there 's the question of money . States concede they 'd need more federal money to implement their reforms . Clinton would rather spend on his own program than subsidize a myriad of state ideas . <p> Chiles echoes the qualms of many governors when he says he " wanted to rush " to get his plan into law " because I was always afraid that Congress , when they get ahold of it , will end up with some kind of top-down plan that wo n't work . " <p> Components of Florida 's plan : Coverage for working poor : Individual pays premium , state pays provider at Medicaid rates . Participation : Voluntary Regional alliances : Creates 11 districts to negotiate coverage from insurers and providers for regional members of the plan . Insurance premiums : Firms with more than 50 employees may not base premiems on medical conditions or job types . A community 's rates are set based on geography , sex , age , family and tobacco use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for appropriate care . <p> From California to Maryland , what 's being studied <p> A look at health-care reforms under consideration in several states : <p> California : Gov . Pete Wilson proposes putting 3 million poor Californians in free countywide health plans to provide basic medical services . <p> Connecticut : Legislature is considering bills barring insurers from setting small-business rates according to claims they 've filed , forcing insurers to open preferred-provider networks to any qualified doctor . The state 's 1994 budget would impose 6% sales tax on hospital services to provide coverage for the uninsured . <p> Massachusetts : May put Medicaid recipients into managed care organizations and cut some benefits . <p> Maryland : Is moving to make health insurance accessible and mandatory for small employers ; prohibit insurers from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions . It also may limit doctors ' fees for each procedure . <p> Michigan : $ 51 billion plan would provide state-paid coverage for about 800,000 children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid . <p> Missouri : Twice-defeated bill would fund comprehensive single-payer plan by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another would increase tobacco tax to expand coverage to children , pregnant women . <p> Tennessee : Wants to scrap Medicaid and restructure the program . <p> Texas : Gov . Ann Richards has endorsed a bill that offers small businesses three more affordable health insurance packages that provide bare bones , in-hospital and comprehensive coverage . <p> Washington : Considering plan to provide subsidized health coverage for 450,000 uninsured by 1997 . <p> West Virginia : $ 1.1 billion Medicaid plan would impose $ 95 million new taxes on health providers .
