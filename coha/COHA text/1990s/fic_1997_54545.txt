l't was a simple choice , the way she figured , and I still think she . was right . Either she went willingly , ignoring everything still unsettled , or she could refuse and risk guilt for the rest of her life . <p> So there really was no choice . She made a reservation , bought a suitcase , and headed for the airport . <p> But you should have seen her the week before . An hour or so a day walking the streets , talking of nothing else to everyone she met . <p> Each of whom had the same reaction to her story that she was going to spend four days with her parents , at their home , for the first time in twenty-two years . <p> " You mean you have n't seen them in twenty-two years ? " <p> " No , I have a few times , but here . We 've gone out for lunch , with the children . " <p> " Oh . Well . That will be a heavy trip : ' To a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled theirs . One confided : " Whenever I go home , I ca n't sleep . " Another said he lost , after three days at home , whatever adulthood he 'd acquired . <p> So then she , for whom the sentiment of going home did n't exist , because she was at home where she was , nevertheless began to worry that there would be more to it . Some awful secret that would render her a child . Events she had run from and forgotten . Love aggrieved . Some home still there . <p> Scared , she caught a stomach flu , or maybe it was nerves . Could n't eat for a couple of days . Got delayed packing and had to wash her hair at the last minute . <p> But finally she did leave , on a bright February day , in a taxi , since her father was paying . When they reached that high point on the BQE at the Kosciusko Bridge , and every building in Manhattan stood revealed along the curved horizon , she said to herself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going . <p> Then she turned her eyes toward Miami . <p> On the plane , her appetite returned as soon as she was served . So it was a bug , she thought , not some gastrointestinal response to anxiety . Relieved , she relished the bad food . <p> The champagne helped , too . She toasted her seatmate and told him her story . Of him , she learned that after a boyhood on the Lower East Side , he 'd become a diamond merchant , traveling extensively . Now , though , he had semi-retired to Florida and got most of his exercise , he said , between the sheets . When he inquired as to the cause of this long separation from her family , she replied : It was for love . He nodded sadly . Had he had the courage to marry his shiksa , he said , he 'd have led a far better life . Instead he 'd spent twenty years with someone he detested . Lizzy pitied him , worn by his anger , and when he asked for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't displeased . Cute in a graying way , she decided . But then he handed her an old , wrinkled card . Oh well , she thought , and then they landed . <p> But I forgot to say she 'd been hemming a skirt , flashing her thimble all through the air over the Eastern seaboard . Another chore left undone . What had they called her at that long-ago home ? Last-Minute Lizzy , she remembered . <p> With her head bent over this task , her wet braided hair fell across her face . She 'd spent the first decade of her life with four braids in her hair , as styled by her mother , two in front " to catch the short ends ; ' which were then braided into the back two , the effect a sort of Mediterranean Heidi . Relocated now on her own aesthetic map , she sometimes hung her front braids out . <p> Anyway , her hair had dried and the skirt was done when Lizzy got off the plane and descended to the luggage madness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to let her parents know she 'd arrived , but it was hard to drag herself away from the hope that hers would be the next suitcase round the bend . When finally she did phone , the line was busy . After a few tries , she fought her way back through the crowd , found her bag , and went for the limo . It was n't there . The service her mother had told her to take did n't operate at that airport . The driver she did find claimed , after some discussion , that her destination was not on the map of Miami . And was n't she herself saying she 'd never been there ? Even her insistence that mail got through was discounted ; he seemed not to credit that at all . However , at last , despite his reservations , he consented to drive her around  --  all night , if necessary . <p> Lizzy sighed , wiped sweat , and squeezed herself into a corner of the car , feeling homesick and as though she 'd crossed some border while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . <p> It seemed like another very long time before they started and until each of the ladies was driven within inches of her very front door and carefully , deferentially , unloaded . But eventually Lizzy found herself alone with the driver on a palm-lined road that wound between concrete castles at once large and insubstantial . " Which way is the sea ? " she asked , as she 'd never seen a Southern one and even a view of it in the dark seemed appealing . But when he gestured at the neon-lit motels to their left , she gave the idea up  --  anyway , it was already an hour since the plane had landed , and she knew her parents would be worried . She began to discuss the address once more , but in her confusion kept calling it by the name of the Cuban arts council , which was " esactly " the same " escept " for two letters . It was to her immense relief , then , that they finally turned at a sign into an underground garage . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels , numbered stalls , were everywhere , you could drive around all night . When he spied some people walking at the far end , he sped after them , and for a moment , frazzled as Lizzy was , she thought he would run them over . <p> Luckily he did n't , for they 'd been placed there , it seemed , by divine chance : her parents ' next-door neighbors . <p> And so it was that Lizzy found herself in an elevator , crowded between two elderly couples who had undertaken with pleasure to deliver her . Four storks four for this rebirth . The day 's assault on her senses heightened . Each questioned her , smiled , stared , they would have turned her upside down and shook her if they could 've . The hullabaloo increased when they reached her parents ' apartment and crowded into the open doorway , where her father , after greeting her , began to thank her escorts , while she , shoving her bag , advanced toward her mother , who was also talking and wailing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liz thought , but later realized that this was coupled with a lack of comprehension of why these people had brought her daughter . They spilled into the living room , reenacting the drama of their finding her in the garage and rescuing her from the infamous limousine service that charged a mint but did n't know a thing ( well , the building 's new , someone contended , you ca n't blame them , it 's hard to see from the road ) . Then her parents , of course , played can-you-top-this . When she had n't come  --  or phoned , they added pointedly  --  why , they had wanted to call the police ! Why , they had actually called the airline , the terminal , the terminal they had called many times ... And in defense , then , Lizzy felt obliged to pitch her own stories of the crowd and the busy phone into the excitement flying around the room . <p> But ultimately the door was shut , and she faced her mother , who in the year since Lizzy had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who now embraced her from this inferior position , saying , " Well , now I can have a good cry . " And so she stood holding her little weeping mother , as small as a twelve year-old , and she thought , not without some regret , Here I wo n't be a child . But then  --  a step back , the critical eye , even from lower down  --  your hair ! No good , the hair , and here her father joined them and concurred . " You look like a pi- , " said her mother , " a pic- , a picka- , pic-pic-pic , picpicpic ... " <p> Here let us leave our Lizzy freeze-frame a minute . Would her mother really say the word pickaninny , and start this visit off with a bang ? Well , she might have , but she could n't remember it until two days later , during another hair discussion , and then Lizzy herself in sarcasm said it , and her mother happily , obliviously cried out , " That 's the word I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she , Lizzy , seeing in an instant what was required , wisely launched a verbal distraction , and towed them along until they were all safely drinking tea and opening the presents she had brought them . <p> But when , later , she lay adjoining her mother at one end of the L-shaped daybed arrangement of the bedroom ( her father in the living room on the couch ) , the strangeness of it all assailed her . Though certainly she could manage four days , she thought , especially in the sunny South , midwinter . Still , she fell asleep thinking of the diamond man 's bitter life , and not of these two old people breathing near her . <p> The next day was Lincoln 's Birthday . There in the South you would never have guessed . Just as you would never have guessed , watching Lizzy between her mother and father , their delighted introduction of her to their friends around the pool , and the smiles exchanged under that pastel sky , that this family had no recent history . <p> Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as she hemmed her skirt on the plane , Lizzy had remembered her mother pinning a hem for her , asking , " Who was that Negro boy you said hello to ? " <p> Lizzy had long gone her separate way when her father , ill , sent for her . A few years after that , on a visit north , he met her children . In Lizzy 's kitchen , he kissed their hands . <p> I am reminded , telling this , of an encounter she had one summer evening in a college town . She had differed , loudly and goodhumoredly , with a Pole who claimed to recognize her . " There 's a history of you in Europe , " he said . " When we sent our girls to school with the goyim , all the smart ones married Marxists so they could leave the ghetto and change the world " <p> Lizzy had laughed , but she had left the ghetto on her own . <p> Still , now , in Miami , she began to feel guilty as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked in too much water . Should I have demanded more of them , she wondered , should I have insisted , You must love us , you must let us love you ! What ought I to feel , now , that I do n't ? An evening of TV stupefied her . That second night , in dreams she chased an elusive man  --  her lover , though ; not her father . <p> In the morning , she was up before them , and over a cup of instant coffee and what seemed to be the same piece of oilcloth on the kitchen table that she remembered from twenty-two years before , wrote in a journal : Air . Air . Air . <p> They lived a couple of blocks from a beach they never went to , across the way from a pool they never swam in , in an air-conditioned apartment with the air off and the windows shut . It was neat but neglected ; her mother shuffled around and was forgetful ; her father , his prostate troubled , had smelly pajamas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when they woke , so she went out alone . The previous day 's guilt persisted . What had she done for them in return for her life ? And the question of emotion : it was too strange to feel so little . <p> Outside , at the elaborately landscaped entry to the building , a young man was slumped in the cab of a trailer truck . So bored , she thought , too bad . She walked on , to a place she had seen from the window , a sandy lot beside a waterway , and sat down among some intricate , wicked-looking weeds , hoping to smoke a joint and come to some conclusions . The hot sun on her back felt terrific . She shut her eyes . Almost immediately two sounds in sequence  --  ordinary sounds , first a hammer , then a gull  --  completed , with the sand and sun , a scene she had once imagined and described . Once again , life follows art , she thought , and it was with gratitude that she thought then of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can feel this , I 'll have other feelings , she thought , and jumped up to return to the house . <p> The young man was still morose in his truck . She could n't leave him like that . " You have n't left ; ' she said , and he said , " Nope . " He came from Rhode Island , he told her . His boss was inside , trying to get a load for the trip back . He liked his job , but sometimes , like now , it was a drag . " Here , " she said , as she was about to go , and left him open-mouthed , holding the joint . <p> So it was n't only her thanks but this bonhomie that she carried back to her father , who was sitting in his chair  --  yes , his chair . She kissed him when she walked in , and as she went into the bedroom , she could hear , loud through his tracheotomy , a sigh of satisfaction . <p> That evening , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one missing from the album , a proof she had asked for in letters , taken on the day she 'd first fought for control : at ten , combed her hair the way she wanted . The proof was nowhere to be found , her mother adamant it did n't exist . They nearly argued . But then Lizzy found a picture of herself she 'd never seen , taken just before she had never gone home again , a snapshot of her as a young woman , seated in front of a window , her hand extended as though reaching for something . There I was , here I am , she thought , and was content . Her mother also liked that picture . Like a girl reporter , she said , and gave it to Lizzy as a present . <p> The next day was Valentine 's , and they went to a dance . Her father , once a terrific man on the floor , still had rhythm but was more subdued . And he would n't Latin . He did bum a cigarette for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood outside with Lizzy while she smoked it . After one drag , she did n't want it , but took her time because it was so clearly his remembered pleasure . <p> With her mother she danced also , in the lead position , twirling her around until the little woman was dizzy and then got the giggles , tears pouring out of her eyes as Lizzy steadied her and kissed her . A woman commented , " You do n't usually see a daughter kissing her mother , ' and Lizzy , thinking of her own three , thought , That 's what you do n't see , lady . But her mother had made a noodle dish for the dance and then did n't want to share it . " But you must ! " Lizzy cried out , astonished . <p> The next day it rained steadily , and she thought at first she would n't go out , but then decided to anyway . " In the rain ? " they worried . " To get things for the children " she insisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenir shops had been made in the Philippines . She went from store to store , until at the end of a wide boulevard she saw an open space , between two buildings , that looked as if it might be a way to the sea . Which since the night of her arrival she had purposely forgotten , in order to concentrate on wanting , for once , to be with her parents more than in the world . <p> Excited now , she crossed the street and ascended a slight sandy rise . And there it was , impossible aqua marina , a Southern sea even under such a rainy sky . <p> There was a fishing pier to her left , and she went to read the sign on it . Admission was fifty cents . But under the pier , she noticed , you could get right up to the water . As she stood deciding , a man came down the ramp toward her . He was carrying a bucket , and when they smiled at each other , she was pleased that the South could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could greet in some polite and uncomplicated manner . She asked about his catch , and he told her the names of the fish . " Well " she said , " I think I 'll just go swimming instead , even if it is raining , ' and they laughed together before saying goodbye . <p> The pier stank of creosote and gulls , but Lizzy waded into the warm surf and picked up three little perfectly shaped shells . And then a small white sailboat appeared , moving slowly across the horizon . <p> And that was enough . I can remember this , she thought , and turned to go , anxious lest her parents worry she was gone too long in the rain , and besides she had n't yet bought a single thing for the children . <p> She walked up the beach , glancing from time to time over her shoulder at the perfect little sailboat in the perfectly blue sea , until she realized it was no longer raining . As she stopped to dose the umbrella , a man came toward her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small knot of people . He smiled as he went by , and noting her curiosity , pointed to the group , and said , " Beeg feesh . " <p> Beeg feesh ? She grinned at him and then approached the group , who indeed had a big fish , lying there on the sand , sleek and dead and heavy-looking . She gazed at it , dismayed , for something about its flesh was doglike , and then looking up met the eyes of the young blond woman whose fish it was , who stood over it . There was such a look in them , oh ! Lizzy glanced around but met on every side the same spirit , though none so full of it , so completely hateful , it seemed , as that of the girl . <p> She turned away and continued walking , her good mood arrested . As if just the sight of her had been enough for them to suspect she might steal it , steal their beeg feesh . When she had only wanted to see it . She made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the three little shells in her pocket , thought the children would like those , fixed up nice , because at least they were really from Miami . <p> So she rejoined her parents , and spent another pleasant evening saying little . In the morning , her mother waved goodbye from under the covers , accepting a kiss with her eyes half-shut . <p> Her father drove her to the airport . When she stood waving at him from the sidewalk in front of the terminal , he kept his eyes fixed on the road . But he was eighty and did n't drive too well anymore , and Lizzy was grateful that he 'd even offered . <p> This time her seatmate on the plane was a lawyer , and they breakfasted chatting about children and careers . Lizzy felt relieved to have an extended conversation , as if it proved her intact . <p> But she was eager to be home . The weather in New York was cold and unpleasant , during the night it had snowed . She took a taxi she could ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Kosciusko , the meter jumping , the driver irate . It had been her idea to take the BQE . A car cut in front . " Damn nigger ; ' the driver said . <p> " Big hit , " her mother said , when she phoned that evening , " you were a big hit . " <p> Big hit , Lizzy thought , then suddenly thought , Big fish . And hung up thinking this : You can fish in the past , but the only fish to see , finally , is the beeg feesh , the one we 're all afraid the other guy will steal . <p> <p> By HETTIE JONES <p>
