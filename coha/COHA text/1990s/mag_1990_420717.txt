Permanent bolts are turning cliffs in many national parks into artificial climbing walls <p> LAST AUGUST , Ranger Maura Longden stopped to watch a couple of rock climbers putting up a new route on Lumpy Ridge , a popular climbing area in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado . <p> The climbers were clearly traditionalists : they mostly used removable devices to clip their ropes into and drilled few holes into the rock for permanently fixed bolts . The few bolts they , did install were unobtrusive and used only where there was no other option . <p> " A sport climber probably could n't do this route-he would n't know how , " one of them said to Longden . <p> He was referring to the new breed of aggressive climbers who drill all-bolt routes on formerly pristine rock , thereby dismissing the " clean climbing " ethic of leaving no traces . <p> Because all-bolt routes usually are difficult-and consequently desired by climbers perhaps more ambitious than reflective-the use of bolts , facilitated by portable electric drills , recently has become an issue-in virtually any national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is that cliffs in many national parks are becoming the equivalent of artificial climbing walls . Often routes literally are within an arm 's length of one another . In a popular climbing are a about 40 miles from Rocky Mountain National Park . so many new routes have been put up that some climbers keep track of them on computers . <p> In the 1980s , as climbing increased in popularity and climbing routes proliferated , so did trails leading to the bases of popular cliffs . The access paths , which veered off official hiking trails , and the new climbing routes sometimes had devastating effects on wildlife and plants . The trails encouraged erosion and endangered vulnerable plants , and some bolted routes were so close to nests that the birds abandoned their territory . <p> Other park users complained about the whine of motorized drills as well as the music blaring from the large , portable cassette players favored by many rock climbers . <p> Park managers have responded to the situation in many ways , from ignoring the problem to forbidding all rock climbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service currently-has no system-wide policy concerning climbing but allows each park to adopt its own standard dependent upon the pressure it is receiving . " We do n't want to take the decision-making away from the local officials , " said Butch Farabee of the Park Service . " But ultimately we will need some umbrella guidelines for the parks . " <p> Motorized drills have been banned at ' many-national parks and monuments , including Rocky Mountain National Park . Joshua Tree and Pinnacles national monuments in California , and Big Bend National Park in Texas . Officials at some parks , including Canyonlands in Utah , allow drills in certain areas but forbid climbers to use chalk , which often leaves rock permanently splotched . <p> Others , concerned about the effect climbing can have on nearby raptors , archeological features , and surrounding ecosystems , have simply banned all climbing , with varying success . <p> At one point , Big Bend managers forbade the sport , in part because climbers were bolting on rocks with pictographs . Many climbers ignored the ban and even surreptitiously installed new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rangers reached a detente with the climbers , who agreed to avoid sensitive areas and to install new routes only after consulting park managers . Pinnacles , too , was temporarily closed to climbing until new restrictions , similar to those set by Big Bend , were imposed . <p> Because bolting is as much an issue among many climbers as it is among park managers , some climbers have taken matters into their own hands . In Yosemite , bolted routes have been chopped-the bolts ' heads cut flush with the rock-by exasperated traditionalists John Bachar and Kurt Smith , who took responsibility for their actions . <p> But chopping routes can be dangerous . If a climber is high on a route and expects to clip a rope into a bolt , and no bolt is there , he or she could easily fall . <p> What is the solution ? At Rocky Mountain National Park , which lures climbers to its high peaks as well as to Lumpy Ridge , rangers formed an internal task force , including plant and wildlife specialists and employees who climb , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task force looked at how other national parks addressed their climbing problems and consulted with rangers in nearby Boulder Mountain Parks and Eldorado State Park , both climbing meccas . <p> With officials from these parks and local climbers , the Rocky Mountain rangers wrote a suggested code of ethics for climbers . Basically , the code asks climbers to treat others with respect , to leave no trace , and to pack out what they pack in . The code has been posted at trailheads used by climbers and distributed in local mountaineering shops . Rangers at all these parks are working with the Colorado Climbers Coalition , an organization concerned about access and ethics , to finalize the code and reach an agreement that balances the climbers ' interests with the welfare of the park and other users . <p> " The climbers have made it clear that the , want to take a good part of the responsibility , and they 've been cooperative in helping to educate other climbers about ethical behavior , " said Longden , who is a capable climber herself . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many of our national parks . Anything we decide upon has to be with the cooperation of climbers . We 're not trying to inhibit climbing or close our eves to the advances made in climbing . We 're struggling with the issue of , what 's appropriate in a national park . " In many cases , however , bolting is not appropriate . <p> This winter , officials from Rocky Mountain National Park will hold several public meetings to discuss options with local climbers . According to Longden , who chaired the task force , it will be the first time that climbers have been allowed to help shape policy from the beginning . <p> " We are not talking about a wholesale ban , but about being reasonable and respectful , " she said . <p> " Those two guys I watched last August were putting up a pretty difficult route , as difficult as a lot of bolt routes . It was kind of interesting to see that , because it showed that you can still put up high-grade climbs without resorting totally to bolts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hole for a permanent bolt at Cayonlands National Park 's Point Beyond . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Many climbers dismiss the traditional climbers ' ethic of leaving no tracers .
