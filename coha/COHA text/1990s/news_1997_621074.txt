<p> When it comes to the design of their own kitchens , chefs do n't mince words . <p> They insist that their home kitchens must work as hard as their professional kitchens . That means that every detail  --  from the size and number of sinks to issues like lighting and storage  --  is sifted , weighed and tested . And sometimes , even when outwardly perfect , these kitchens are found wanting in the tiniest details . <p> Take Nancy Oakes of San Francisco 's Boulevard restaurant , who recently remodeled her East Bay Arts and Crafts House . <p> " I love my new kitchen , especially the industrial-size pot-washing sink , " she says . " But I 'm constantly fine-thinking it . I also have a small sink for washing vegetables , and it has no garbage disposal . That 's a shame . " <p> Or pastry chef Emily Luchetti of the hot new Farallon , who worked closely with her architect to craft her dream kitchen in Sausalito . <p> The design is suave and efficient , with special small drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  like cooks everywhere  --  she still wishes she had more counter space . <p> Whatever they wish they 'd done differently , these two chefs have had experiences that illustrate some universal truths about design . <p> One is that building from scratch , as Luchetti did , gives homeowners more freedom to create what they want ; a remodel , even one as extensive as Oakes ' , imposes certain limitations on design and creativity . <p> Another is that the best and best-loved kitchens reflect their owners ' style and personality . Luchetti 's kitchen reflects the precision required of a great baker , with vast attention to detail and storage ; Oakes ' kitchen reflects her outgoing style just as dramatically . <p> Today we tour these two chefs ' kitchens , learning that foresight pays off handsomely . . . and that hindsight is inevitable . <p> NANCY OAKES : A HOMEY KITCHEN <p> Like all the best custom remodels and redesigns , Nancy Oakes ' and Bruce Aidells ' Kensington kitchen was planned to perform rather than merely look stylish . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us and be really easy to keep clean , " says Oakes . <p> As seasoned food professionals , Oakes and Aidells ( she 's the chef at Boulevard restaurant in San Francisco , he 's an author and the Bay Area 's sausage king ) spend their work lives in high-energy kitchens . At home , they wanted a kitchen as efficient , practical and no-frills as the ones they live in at work . <p> The remodel , which included adding a new bedroom and bathroom on the second floor of their turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts house , and increasing the height of the kitchen ceiling , took about four months . The 16-foot-square kitchen and adjacent dining room were created from a hodgepodge of smaller rooms with outdated equipment . <p> " We love to cook on weekends and we 're often experimenting with new recipes , " says Oakes , " so we needed lots of counter space , plus work surfaces that would be quick to clean . We avoided granite  --  too glossy and hard  --  and moved toward wood for its warmth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked closely with contractor/designer Robert Miller , president of San Francisco-based USA Construction , to fine-tune materials . They agreed that the aesthetic would be a synthesis of rustic and industrial . <p> " I wanted it to be as hearty and hard-working as a restaurant , but still feel warm and homey , " says Oakes . <p> The couple succeeded : Their wholehearted , improvisational cooking style dictated a 3-foot-by-8- foot central work island topped with a 4-inch-thick butcher-block top . <p> The floor is knotty maple , a rough-grade hardwood , sealed with a polyurethane finish . The new ceiling has exposed beams of rough-cut Douglas fir , the timbers a pleasing counterpoint to stainless-steel work counters and the restaurant-style stove . <p> Aidells likes to have kitchen equipment within easy reach , so the couple 's impressive collection of copper pots and pans now hangs above the island . <p> " The straightforward layout means that we can really enjoy preparation and cooking  --  everything is at hand . " says Oakes . <p> A TOP CHEF 'S TIPS ON DESIGN <p> Here is advice from Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Plan well-modulated overall lighting , as well as focused task lighting . Create pleasing , not harsh , ambient lighting . Be careful not to create shadows . Working at a poorly lit counter or without sufficient light over the stove can lead to kitchen injuries . " <p> * " For many people , sinks are an afterthought . But you should consider how you cook and the kind of equipment and tableware you use . Do you need a sink that holds large pots and pans and cookie trays ? Will your pasta pot fit under the nozzle ? We installed a stainless steel commercial dishwashing sink without dividers . The dividers have very limited actual use . With a big , serviceable sink , you 'll have a lot less water on your kitchen floor . " <p> * " Do n't forget to make room for guests . Make them part of the picture , but keep them out of the traffic line between the stove and the work surface . Design a space where they can sit or stand comfortably , with a wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> * " Two ovens are a must for a family cook who loves to cook for company . . . . If possible , at least one of them should have a convection feature . " <p> * Every recipe tells you to set aside everything that comes steaming and bubbling and spattering out of the oven . Where will you set it aside as you go on with the preparation of other dishes ? You may have ample counter space , but I have another solution . In restaurants we have steel rolling racks to hold large , flat trays from the oven . Install one of these ( available from restaurant supply stores ) under your upper cabinet and up off the counter , and be sure it has ventilation . " <p>  --  " Make sure your garbage is easily accessible  --  especially if you plan to use it for compost . Our garbage container is discreetly but conveniently at the end of the kitchen counter . " <p> *  --  <p> OAKES LISTS BOTH THE BEST AND WORST ASPECTS OF HER REMODELED KITCHEN <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remodeled kitchen . Here is her response . <p> * " The enormous , industrial-size pot-washing sink . The feature truly makes cleanup a breeze . It is deep enough for even the largest stockpot , and the large , stainless steel drying area on one side allows for major stacking . " <p> * " ( The ) old wood countertop on the work island . I was warned against using this old , beat-up wood , but for me it is exactly the right material . I do n't have to worry about damage from sharp knives or scalding pots . The well- worn wood adds a beautiful , rich warmth to the room . " <p> * " ( My ) storage armoire . Instead of using conventional cabinetry , we converted an antique armoire into a highly functional storage space for china , glass , silver and linen . We added a series of drawers and sliding shelves , so our beautiful armoire earns its keep . " <p>  --  " ( The ) pantry . When we were remodeling , we were fortunate to have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with a perfect location for a new pantry . You always need more storage space than you expect . " <p> * " ( The ) counter overhang . The countertop was made wider than the dimension of the island . This allows for a tall , industrial-size garbage bin underneath the counter . Whey pretend that cooking does n't create a mess ? Our trash disposal is within reach , and we can easily sweep directly from the counter . There is no point having tiny trash bins under kitchen sinks . " <p> . . . AND SOME SECOND THOUGHTS <p> Here are a few things Oakes would rethink about her new kitchen . <p> * " I 'd leave nothing unfinished . We thought we could easily add more shelves later , but it 's wise to get it right the first time . Finish every last shelf , rack and painted finish . You 'll never go back and rework on the kitchen design . " <p> * " I 'd make some provision for the organized storage of recyclables . We want to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become cumbersome . " <p> * " We sacrificed 10 burners for a grill , which sounded like a great idea at the time . I think I may have used the grill twice , but I often run out of burners . " <p> CRAB CAKES WITH CORN RELISH , TARTAR SAUCE AND ROASTED TOMATOES <p> From Nancy Oakes .

And when she has a spare Saturday afternoon , she loves to be at home cooking with her husband , Peter . <p> Luchetti 's Sausalito kitchen strikes the perfect balance between smooth styling with luxurious materials and pure practicality . <p> Because they were building the house from scratch , the Luchettis were able to plan their new kitchen meticulously , inch by inch . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter 's brother Robert Luchetti , they had a chance to get most of the details right  --  time well spent , they say . <p> Luchetti was n't interested in being trendy , and her kitchen has the kind of materials , colors , style and equipment that wo n't become dated . She favors easy-to-maintain stainless steel , low-luster mahogany and large areas of marble . <p> Equipment includes Gaggenau wall ovens , range and dishwasher , and a pro-size Sub-Zero refrigerator . <p> " When I 'm at home , cooking is pure pleasure , great enjoyment , " Luchetti says . A native of New York , she 's a graduate of the New York Restaurant School . Before Farallon , she was pastry chef at Stars restaurant in San Francisco and was named one of the country 's top 10 pastry chefs by Chocolatier magazine . <p> " It was important to me to have a great view of the bay , " says Luchetti . " Since I knew I 'd be cooking a lot , I felt I deserved a view . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the house with views only from the living room . " <p> The house is nestled in a green hillside in Sausalito with a view across Richardson Bay , dotted with yachts , sculls , houseboats , flying boats and seals . <p> As shipshape and streamlined as one of the vessels that ply the bay , the 20-by-12-foot kitchen , sculptural and cohesive , includes a dining area and two small pantries . . . and one of the best views in the house . Its floor is set two steps above the two- story living room , giving it a grandstand view . <p> In one pantry , Luchetti keeps all the dessert plates she collects . In the other are her freezer , a microwave oven and specialized prep counters . It 's all as efficient and well planned as a professional kitchen , and stainless steel counters make it easy for Luchetti to prepare and clean up vegetables . <p> A separate pastry prep room and a special storage pantry mean that most of the working part of the kitchen is concealed . The freezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbling its background music . Best of all , at the magic moment when guests sit down at the table near the kitchen , all they see is a spiffy kitchen  --  just what all three Luchettis planned . <p> LUCHETTI 'S PLANNING TIPS <p>  --  " Plan storage specifically to your needs . Look at what you like to cook and which special equipment you use , and be sure to measure exactly the right drawers , pantry cupboards , under- counter shelves or above-counter cupboards for those items . " <p> * " Appliances used every day ( mixer , Cuisinart ) are best stored in cubbyholes at the back of the counter . They 're not behind doors because the doors just end up getting dirty and are hard to clean . " <p> * " If you have room , consider putting the freezer  --  which is mainly for long-term storage  --  in a pantry off the kitchen . That leaves the kitchen for a big refrigerator without a freezer compartment . I also like having an ice machine in the bar area , which saves trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * " Do n't get stuck with a generic kitchen that 's not really right for the way you entertain or live from day to day . For example , our two sinks mean that we can both cook and clean up together . After a large party , Thanksgiving with the family , and Christmas , we can all pitch in , and that speeds things up considerably . " <p> * " Be careful of large commercial ranges . They may look great , but are they self-cleaning ? Unless you have daily help , you may not wish to tackle cleaning these giants yourself . " <p> WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MY KITCHEN <p>  --  " I have a variety of drawers : Small drawers for cookie cutters and small molds ( saves clutter ) , and large drawers to hold huge bowls and pots . " <p> * " A cubbyhole drawer beside the work counter for garlic . " <p> * " Freezers in the pantry . Refrigerators in the kitchen . This allows for more day-to-day refrigeration space in the kitchen . " <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't use every day . " <p> * " Two sinks  --  at least  --  are essential . " <p> WHAT I 'D CHANGE ABOUT IT <p> * " I 'd like more counter space . <p> " You always need more than you can imagine . <p> " Remember that you need space for cooling trays and equipment , as well as work space . " <p> * " I 'd have a lip on the edge of the marble countertop . Then everything is contained on the counter . <p> " No more spills . " <p> * " Would I like a larger kitchen ? <p> " Sometimes , but a lot of thought went into every detail , and truly I would n't change a thing .
