A RECENT EQUIPMENT REVOLUTION IS BRINGING HIGH-TECH , HIGH-SPEED MANEUVERS TO ICEFISHING // Icefishing has a reputation as a slow-action , slow-to-change sport . And to a certain extent , that reputation is deserved . Dressed in the requisite space-suit garb , icefishermen move more like lunar explorers than Michael Jordan . Then there 's the glacial pace of the hand-over-hand retrieve . Even the quarry is gripped by a lethargy that 's only intermittently broken by tentative nips at bait-something icefishermen hyperbolically call " strikes e But icefishing 's image is undergoing a total overhaul . The last several years have seen a technological surge in every aspect of the sport-from high-speed augers and no-stretch jigging lines , to powerful electronics that put the fish , and your lure , before your eyes . Here 's how recent developments have changed the way we fish for winter 's predators . NOT LONG AGO , most walleye fishermen were hanging a live minnow from a float , rattle reel or tip-up . But jigging baits have changed all that . Photograph Are the days of the wooden tip-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it certainly seems so . // " Hardly ever use a live minnow anymore , " says Minnesota icefishing guru Dick ( the Griz ) Grzywinski . " I 'll catch a dozen walleyes on a jigging bait for every one I catch on a minnow . Do n't use ' em-they 're not worth the hassle . " He 's referring , of course , to the timeconsuming chore of manually checking water depth , then positioning bait just above bottom . Which also means that every time you move to a new hole , the depth has to be reset . And because some state laws require anglers to stay within a certain number of feet of their line , that process is a huge drag on mobility . Stick with jigging . Obviously , you 'll want to focus your efforts over prime walleye structure , like a sunken island , a distinct point or the inside turn on a breakline . In this capacity , hand-held GPS units are enormous time-savers . Simply punch in your summertime walleye holes , and begin there . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . Drill a series of holes along the break . This presents some obvious logistical-and labor-problems if you use a traditional auger . Which is why super-sharp power augers are becoming so popular . My personal favorite is the Strikemaster Lazer , which is fitted with a unique curved blade that cuts a hole in half the time it takes any other auger I 've used . Instead of drilling a hole , checking its depth , then moving on as necessary until you find the desired depth , there are now several hand-held sounders that give depth readings through the ice . The best one I 've found is the Polar Vision , which is powerful enough to read through cloudy ice that other units ca n't penetrate . Or , you might try getting a reading using the transducer of an ordinary depth finder . Just be sure to pour a little water on the ice to provide firm contact with the transducer . If you watch a jigging expert work a piece of walleye structure , you might think he 's on a carpet-bombing mission to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm done fishing , " admits the Griz . But there 's a method to his madness . If you 're working an 18- to 24-foot break , for example , drill a line of holes along the structure at 18 , 20 , 22 and 24 feet . This pattern allows you to work your way around the structure at one depth , then jump out to the next series of holes as the fish change their orientation . Walleyes may hold below the deeper holes at midday and then move shallower for the evening bite . This way , your holes are all set to go , and you wo n't risk spooking the fish off the structure by drilling at sunset .

Photograph Getting used to the circular reading has always been a problem for first-time users of flasher units . Zercom has solved that problem with the introduction of the Vertical Flasher , which , as its name implies , shows action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for lure selection , walleyes will take spoons like the Vingla and Swedish Pimple , swimming baits like the Jigging Rapala and vibrating blades like the Cicada and Heddon Sonar . Even plain leadhead jigs tipped with a minnow or minnow head work . My usual choice is a size 3 Swedish Pimple in silver with a green or chartreuse back , tipped with a minnow head ( use the entire minnow , and you 're liable to get short strikes ) . The method is straightforward . I use a sensitive 30-inch graphite rod and a small spinning reel spooled with sixpound mono . Simply lower the spoon to the bottom , reel it up 6 to 12 inches and then give it a gentle twitch . Hold the rod tip stationary as the spoon sinks on the twitch-it will flutter out to the side before settling in the original position . Do n't jig again until the spoon has completely stopped moving-most strikes come after all movement has ceased . A color flasher like the Vexilar FL-8 helps enormously with jig fishing . A walleye hanging a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , shows as either a green band or a thin red one . But as the fish moves nearer to the bait , the green band turns red or the width of the red band increases . With a little experience , you 'll be able to interpret exactly what 's going on beneath youwhether there are any fish , how close they are , which lure actions draw them in and when they 're about to strike . Experiment with the force of your twitching and the length of the pauses in between until you find what the walleyes are looking for on a particular day . Twitch anywhere from three to six inches , and wait 10 seconds or so between each bounce . Watch the flasher closely to see how the fish are responding and adjust your action accordingly . Sometimes the best action is no action at all-prop your rod up on a clump of snow and leave it . Just remember that mobility is the name of the game here . If you jig a hole for five minutes and do n't see a fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE lazy gluttons . They 'd rather cruise around until they find one hearty meal than chase down a dozen small snacks . Which means that , while you may take an occasional pike by jigging , you 're much better off suspending a plump baitfish below a tip-up . The traditional bait is a lively five- to seven-inch sucker , chub or shiner . But pike are often more interested in dead baitfish , particularly oily , smelly ones like smelt or ciscoes . Why the interest in corpses ? Not only do pike rely on scent more than any other predator fish when feeding , but it does n't take a whole lot of energy to catch up to a cadaver . The best way to rig dead bait on a tip-up is on a quick-strike rig using a pair of double or treble hooks . Push one hook into the baitfish near the pectoral fin , the other just in front of the dorsal fin . This arrangement allows you to set the hook much quicker than with a dorsal- or lip-rigged bait . You 'll land more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to swallow the hook , you 'll have a better chance of successfully releasing fish you do n't want to keep . Use 30-pound-test wire leader and a pair of size 2 to 4 treble hooks if you make your own quick-strike . Of the ready-made tackle , my favorite is the Quickset Rig . The hooks are ultra-sharp and the rear hook slides along the harness to accommodate any size baitfish . Set several baits 6 to 12 inches above the bottom in weedy bays , around the edges of cabbage humps and in shallow backwaters that hold panfish . If you strike out , it does n't necessarily mean the fish are n't there , it just means they 're not at that depth . Pike will sometimes pick up dead bait right off the bottom ; at other times , they prefer it hung only a foot under the ice . The only constants are the two characteristics of your bait-stinking and dead . When in Trout WHILE MOST gamefish become sluggish in winter , lake trout get lively under the ice . It 's not unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch helplessly as it powers right back to the bottom . Icefishing for lake trout has become a stick-and-move sport . Time-consuming bait rigs are out , jigging is in . I use a 1/2- to 1-ounce bucktail jig , like the Northland Sting'r Bucktail , in white or chartreuse tipped with a three- to fourinch live shiner , a dead cisco or smelt or a strip of cut bait , such as herring or sucker . If I 'm using cut bait or a minnow more than four inches long , I add a stinger hook to account for short strikes . When lakers are suspended off the bottom , a video or liquid-crystal graph is invaluable for keeping track of the fish and your lure . On the whole , looking for lakers is rapidly turning into " virtual fishing . " Trout love to chase bait , for example , and you can often tempt a strike by reeling up quickly . On my screen , I 've seen the fish follow a bait from the bottom to just a few feet beneath the ice before taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing was happening . Most flashers do n't have the power to reach down the 50 to 200 feet where lakers lurk-a 200 KHZ graph has to have at least 1,000 watts of peak-topeak power . I run a Lowrance LMS 350A graph off a 14-amp motorcycle battery ( enough juice to get me through the day ) . The unit incorporates a GPS , which I use to navigate directly to my fishing spot-usually a structureoriented summertime hotspot . Once there , I switch over to sonar mode . But finding fish does n't necessarily ensure success . Setting the hook in deep water has always been a problem . If you 're fishing in tOO feet of water with mono , for example , you might be contending with almost 20 feet of stretch . The only thing you can do is set the hook and start running away from the hole to get rid of the slack . Or use wire line . But wire fishing is fraught with kinking problems , which sometimes causes unexpected break-offs . The new breed of braided lines , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as miracle lines , are perfect for deep-water laker fishingthere 's no kinking , they 're much less visible than wire line and , because they do n't stretch , they telegraph bites much better than mono . And when a fish comes calling from 100 feet away , clear reception is the only thing that can ensure a winning connection . // Video enables you to " watch " the action down below .
