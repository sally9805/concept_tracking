James Joyce once told a friend , " One of the things I could never get accustomed to in my youth was the difference I found between life and literature . " All serious young readers notice this difference . Joyce dedicated his career to erasing it and in the process revolutionized 20th century fiction . <P> The life he would put into his literature was chiefly his own . Born near Dublin in 1882 , James Augustine Aloysius was the eldest of the 10 surviving children of John and Mary Jane Joyce . His father was irascible , witty , hard drinking and ruinously improvident ; his mother , a devout Roman Catholic , helplessly watched her husband and family slide into near poverty and hoped for a happier life in the hereafter . James ' entire education came at the hands of the Jesuits , who did a better job with him than they may have intended . By the time the young Joyce graduated from University College , Dublin , in 1902 , he decided he had learned enough to reject his religion and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled there . Literature would be his vocation and his bid for immortality . <P> He fled Ireland into self-imposed exile late in 1904 , taking with him Nora Barnacle , a young woman from Galway who was working as a hotel chambermaid in Dublin when Joyce met her earlier that year . ( On hearing that his son had run off with a girl named Barnacle , John Joyce remarked , playing on her last name , " She 'll never leave him . " And , proving puns can be prophetic , she never did . ) <P> Joyce departed Dublin with nearly all the narratives he would ever write already stored in his memory . What remained for him to do was transform this cache into an art that could measure up to his own expectations . <P> As he and Nora and then their two children moved among and around European cities  --  Pola , Trieste , Zurich , Rome , Paris  --  Joyce found clerical and teaching jobs that provided subsistence to his family and his writing . His first published book of fiction , Dubliners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots but long on evocative atmosphere and language . A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ( 1916 ) provided a remarkably objective and linguistically complex account of Stephen Dedalus , i.e. James Joyce , from his birth to his decision to leave Dublin in pursuit of his art . <P> Portrait did not sell well enough to relieve Joyce 's chronic financial worries , but his work by then had attracted the attention of a number of influential avant-gardists , most notably the expatriate American poet Ezra Pound , who believed a new century demanded new art , poetry , fiction , music  --  everything . Such supporters rallied to promote Joyce and his experimental writings , and he did not disappoint them . <P> He began Ulysses in 1914 ; portions of it in progress appeared in the Egoist in England and the Little Review in the U.S. , until the Post Office , on grounds of alleged obscenity , confiscated three issues containing Joyce 's excerpts and fined the editors $100 . The censorship flap only heightened curiosity about Joyce 's forthcoming book . Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of Einstein and Freud .
