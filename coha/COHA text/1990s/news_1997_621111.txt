<p> In the competitive world of cookbook publishing , she 's a living legend . With 3.5 million books in print , the East Bay 's Mollie Katzen is one of the country 's best-selling cookbook authors , in a league with Sheila Lukins ( of " Silver Palate " fame ) and Martha Stewart . Trendy food magazines virtually ignore her , but Katzen 's homespun vegetarian recipe collections  --  " Moosewood Cookbook , " " Enchanted Broccoli Forest " and " Still Life With Menu "  --  have generated a fan club for the reclusive author that has surprised no one more than her . <p> Next month , Hyperion will publish Katzen 's first adult cookbook in nine years , " Mollie Katzen 's Vegetable Heaven . " ( She co-authored " Pretend Soup , " a cookbook for kids , published in 1994 . ) Supported by a big- time publicity budget and a companion cooking show on public television that launches next month , the new book could further the 46- year-old 's fame and leave even more observers shaking their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a culinary voice that endures ? <p> " I had no idea it would become a commercial thing , " says Katzen now of the original " Moosewood Cookbook , " a hand-lettered , spiral-bound and self-published recipe collection that she put together in the mid- 1970s while a cook and partner at the Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca , N.Y . Customers were constantly asking for recipes , and they snapped up the humble book : The first 800 copies sold in a week . <p> More brisk sales followed , and friends encouraged Katzen to seek a national publisher . One New York house expressed interest but wanted to typeset the book and drop Katzen 's whimsical drawings . Only Phil Wood at Berkeley 's Ten Speed Press was game enough to publish the unconventional manuscript unaltered , including what Katzen calls " my printing on good behavior . " <p> The new " Moosewood Cookbook " sold slowly at first , taking three years to earn back the $ 10,000 author advance . By 1980 , when word-of-mouth began to spur book sales , Doubleday approached Katzen about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the restaurant and any thoughts of a cookbook career and was preparing for graduate studies in piano . <p> Just days before her conservatory audition , she had an epiphany . " Kind of a depressed epiphany , " admits Katzen , " an epiphany that I hate performing the piano . I can barely play with my friends in the room . I ca n't stand performing ; I 'm very shy about it . ' Am I crazy ? Why do n't I write the cookbook ? ' So I took the contract and never played the audition . " <p> Eventually , she pulled the manuscript for " Enchanted Broccoli Forest " from Doubleday and took it to Ten Speed , where it has sold a million copies and counting . " Still Life With Menu " followed in 1988 and " Pretend Soup " in 1994 . <p> Booksellers , cookbook authorities and Katzen herself remain puzzled by her four books ' success and longevity . <p> Was it largely good timing , being first in a vegetarian niche that has become increasingly crowded ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big name in vegetarianism , " says Kirschenbaum , publisher of A World of Cookbooks , a cookbook newsletter . " She had the whole field to herself . Yes , there was Anna Thomas ( ' The Vegetarian Epicure ' ) , but who else was there ? In my next issue , I hate to tell you how many vegetarian books I 'm reviewing  --  and they 're all good ones . " <p> Bookstores today have entire sections of vegetarian books , divided by special interest . There are books for vegans , for low-fat vegetarians , for Jewish vegetarians  --  probably even for low-fat Jewish vegetarians , jokes Ellen Rose , owner of Cook 's Library , a Los Angeles bookstore . " Our vegetarian section is just enormous , " says Rose . An unknown vegetarian author today  --  as Katzen was in 1977  --  would have a hard time competing with established writers such as Deborah Madison , Martha Rose Shulman and Diana Shaw . <p> The growing number of almost- vegetarians  --  people who occasionally want a meatless meal  --  also probably fueled Katzen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this camp , she suspects , from self-described pesco-vegetarians  --  who allow themselves fish  --  to what she jokingly calls " Haagen Daszian vegans . " When a taxi driver in Nashville told her he had to have meat once a day , Katzen told him her books were for his other two meals . ( He bought one . ) <p> Despite the meatless movement , some observers wonder how Katzen 's retro recipes continue to sell . Are ' 90s cooks really still making Scheherazade Casserole ( bulgur and soybeans ) and Carrot-Mushroom Loaf ? <p> " She is sort of frozen in time , " says Rose , whose customers continue to demand the books . Kirschenbaum also thinks Katzen , until recently , failed to keep up . " She had reached a point where , sad to say , other people surpassed her because they were doing more delicious vegetarian food , " says the newsletter publisher , who hastens to add that the forthcoming book is " absolutely wonderful . " <p> The author herself seems surprised that her early recipes still draw modern readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ( the books ) , but I keep getting young people , " says Katzen . " I thought they would think Moosewood was too ' crunchy , ' too hippie . " <p> Clearly , modern readers like what fans have always liked about Katzen 's books : their approachability . Her style is friendly , chatty , ingenuous ; her recipes use only supermarket ingredients . If that means pad Thai without fish sauce , so be it . <p> Her pragmatic sensibility has always clicked with budget-minded college students and beginning cooks . " People buy ' Moosewood ' who would never buy ' Greens , ' " says Taya Monfried , manager of the cookbook department at Sur La Table in Berkeley , referring to the more sophisticated tome on vegetarian cooking from Greens restaurant in San Francisco . <p> People do buy the Greens cookbook , says Kirschenbaum , but they cook from Moosewood . After 20 years , some of the dishes are legendary , such as the beloved Brazilian Black Bean Soup . On the Internet , home cooks eagerly share tried-and- true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread presence in American kitchens . <p> Despite her sales figures , Katzen eventually began to feel uncomfortable with the first two books and the level of cooking knowledge they represented . Against Wood 's advice , she launched revisions in 1990 , intent on making the recipes lower in fat , bolder in seasoning , and easier . Meticulously retesting , she eliminated dozens of eggs , pints of sour cream , pounds of butter and cheese  --  all the enrichments that , as a young vegetarian cook , she had relied on to make the food taste better . " That was an insecurity , " says Katzen now . <p> Revising also meant redoing hundreds of hand-lettered pages at the rate of about four a day  --  a tedious , eye-straining process that Katzen says she can no longer tolerate . Reluctantly , she agreed to typesetting both " Still Life With Menu " and " Pretend Soup . " <p> The latter book was a departure in other ways , a children 's cookbook written with Ann Henderson , her son 's nursery school teacher . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cooking  --  from better motor skills to broader palates . <p> Ironically , Katzen says she rarely makes meals with her 6-year-old daughter or 13-year-old son . " I 'm not very sociable in the kitchen , " admits the author , who prefers to cook meditatively and alone . Besides , she says , their fussy eating habits frustrate her . <p> " I told my son when he was about 4 that he could either eat a bowl of whole-grain cereal every night or he could eat what we ate , thinking he 'd get sick of the cereal . Two years later he was still eating the cereal , " says the author , who ca n't figure out where she went wrong . " I pick up a copy of ' Fanny at Chez Panisse ' ( Alice Waters ' book about her daughter ) and I think , ' How come her kid eats cherry tomatoes ? ' " <p> Fortunately , her son 's tastes have broadened enough to enjoy the Thai and Japanese restaurants she and her husband prefer . " Until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to a whisper , " we would have to stop off for a Happy Meal beforehand . " <p> Next month , Katzen launches a grueling 26-city book tour for " Vegetable Heaven " that will take her from San Diego to her hometown of Rochester , N.Y . It 's her " Faustian deal , " she laughs , part of earning back the significant advance that persuaded her to leave Ten Speed Press for Hyperion . <p> Kirsty Melville , Ten Speed 's publisher , confirms that Hyperion offered " a substantial amount of money we just could n't match . So we said , ' Go with God and best of luck to you . ' It 's a wonderful opportunity for her . " <p> On the one hand , the book tour and new TV show offer Katzen the chance to clear up public confusion about the many cookbooks with the Moosewood name . A legal settlement allows the Ithaca restaurant to publish books that have either " Moosewood Restaurant " or " Moosewood Collective " in the title . Katzen has rights to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " One of the reasons I wanted to come out more is because there were all these other books being written with the name Moosewood on them , " says Katzen . " I wanted people to know , ' I 'm Mollie and I did these books . I 'm a person , not a collective . ' " <p> On the other hand , Katzen is a reluctant celebrity , a homebody who relishes daily walks in neighboring Tilden Park with her husband , and who never has enough time to draw and paint in her upstairs studio . With television making her more recognizable  --  the first 13-part series of " Mollie Katzen 's Cooking Show " aired widely  --  Katzen worries about fans spotting her in old shorts and uncombed hair at Berkeley 's Monterey Market or staring at the groceries in her cart . <p> Not long ago , Katzen and her film crew were taping a segment at Green Gulch Farm in Bolinas . As she sat down for a quiet lunch alone , she noticed a number of strangers waving and smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I was , " relates Katzen , " so I waved and said hi , and later he asked if that was OK . I said , ' Well , to be honest with you , I do n't have a need for people to know who I am . ' He thought about that and came back later and said , ' You know , they have a need to know who you are . Your book means a lot to them , and it means a lot to them that they saw you today . ' " <p> For the performance-shy pianist who never auditioned , the cook who likes to be alone , these are tough new realities . Preserving her privacy and anonymity while simultaneously promoting a book and TV show  --  and perhaps , down the road , some packaged products  --  may not prove possible . But for a brief while longer , Katzen can be the little-recognized artist who turned a love for drawing and cooking into a vegetarian empire . <p> The following recipes are from " Mollie Katzen 's Vegetable Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> MOROCCAN ROASTED VEGETABLE STEW <p> This recipe is from the forthcoming " Mollie Katzen 's Vegetable Heaven " ( Hyperion , October 1997 ) . <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> * A little olive oil <p> * 2 medium onions , cut in 1- inch chunks <p> * 1/2 pound baby carrots <p> * 1 tablespoon cumin seeds <p> * 1 tablespoon mustard seeds <p> * Salt to taste <p> * 1 medium head of garlic <p> * 6 medium tomatoes , not too ripe <p> * 4 large red and/or yellow bell peppers <p> * 1 cinnamon stick <p> * 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas ( or a 15- ounce can , rinsed and drained ) <p> * 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice ( possibly more ) <p> * Freshly ground black pepper to taste <p> * Minced fresh parsley ( optional ) <p> * Lemon wedges ( optional ) <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Preheat the oven to 375 degrees . <p> Line 2 large baking trays with foil and brush them with olive oil .
