To those of us who knew his work , Mario Vargas Llosa 's campaign in the late 1980s for the presidency of his native Peru seemed to be a quixotic enterprise . Here was the acclaimed author of such works as The Time of the Hero and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter immersing himself in the rococo poltics of a country embattled by stratospheric inflation , pervasive corruption , severe ethnic tensions and a murderous band of Maoists known as the Shining Path . Most of Vargas Llosa 's readers sighed happily when he finally lost in June 1990 to Alberto Fujimori . <P> Understandably , the author does not entirely share this sense of relief . A Fish in the Water ( Farrar Straus Giroux ; 532 pages ; $25 ) is his bittersweet look at the nearly three years he spent in public life . It all came about , he says , " through the caprice of the wheel of fortune . " At the time , he thought of his decision to campaign for the presidency as a " moral " one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position of leadership at a critical moment in the life of my country . " But that 's what all politicians say . Vargas Llosa the writer is now willing to dig a bit deeper into his reasoning . " If the decadence , the impoverishment , the terrorism , and the multiple crises of Peruvian society had not made it an almost impossible challenge to govern such a country , it would never have entered my head to accept such a task . " Could any motivation be more quixotic than that ? <P> Vargas Llosa intersperses his account of his public life with chapters about his childhood and youth , beginning with a vivid and traumatic memory . One day when he was 10 years old , his mother revealed to him that his father had not died before little Mario was born , as he had always been told , but was alive and was waiting in a nearby hotel to meet his son for the first time . The boy was not amused . The reasppearance of Ernesto J. Vargas , who had abandoned his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yanked out of his mother 's loving , extended family , the Llosas , and forced to live in close quarters with an extremely irritable stranger . <P> In fiction , the cruelties experienced in childhood might be used to explain the adult who survived them , but Vargas Llosa does not attempt to make such connections here . The sections on the campaign and those on his youth run along parallel tracks , and the story of his early life trails off after he graduates from college and decides to go to Europe and write . Both stories have a matter-of-fact air about them that suggests the author is more inerested in remembering his past than in interpreting it . <P> In the political chapters , this tendency can lead to some pretty humdrum passages : " We held the first Freedom Day in the Hotel Crillon , in Lima , on Feburary , 6 , 1988 ; the second , devoted to agrarian subjects , at the San Jose hacienca in Chincha on February 18 ; on February 26 , in Arequipa ... " For most readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs than can fairly be expected .
