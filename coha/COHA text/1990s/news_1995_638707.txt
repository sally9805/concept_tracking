<p> The Denver Broncos are playing a team without a city today . The Oilers . Period . No Houston . No Nashville . A team adrift somewhere in the vast darkness that has become the future of the National Football league . <p> Houston does n't want them . <p> Nashville may not be able to afford them . <p> What will become of them ? <p> It was just a week ago last Thursday that Oilers owner Bud Adams signed a nonbinding agreement with Nashville mayor Phil Bredesen , formally announcing that after 36 years in residence he is moving his team from Houston to Nashville , depending on a couple of critical pre-move performance clauses . <p> The Astrodome , according to Adams , is no longer functionally or economically fit for a pro football team , and the city of Houston is either unwilling or unable to build him a new stadium . Nashville , on the other hand , is supposed to build him a 65,000-seat , open-air stadium to be ready for play by 1998 in a $ 292 million package that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The NFL will believe that when it sees it . <p> To pull it off , Nashville is going to have to sell 82 of 100 luxury suites , priced from $ 50,000 to $ 125,000 , by Jan. 15 , and another 44,700 personal seat licenses , at an average price of $ 1,600 , by Feb. 15 . <p> And that 's the rub . Suddenly , personal seat licenses may not be the licenses to steal they once were . <p> What worked so well in the Carolinas and in St. Louis is n't working so well in Oakland and does n't look that promising in Nashville . <p> In Oakland , the stadium marketing association that sells tickets for Raiders games is still more than 5,000 PSLs short of the 44,000 it promised Al Davis it would maintain for 10 years , and has been losing customers faster than it has been gaining them in recent weeks . To make up the difference , the city has had to pay the Raiders the difference out of its pocket . <p> In Nashville , local officials claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , and are confident of a similar enthusiasm for the sale of individual PSLs when they go on sale after the first of the year . But in looking at a population base of just 1.2 million , the NFL does n't share that confidence . <p> That 's why Adams signed a nonbinding agreement . That 's why San Antonio officials are poised to move in if Nashville fails . And that 's why the league still considers Houston among the teams under consideration for possible relocation to Los Angeles . <p> That 's probably why Pat Bowlen backpedaled faster than his left cornerback , Ray Crockett , the other day after earlier suggesting that personal seat licenses might be a good way to provide the Denver Broncos with a new or improved stadium . <p> It is also why NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue , in a visit to Denver last week , said that because of the backlash PSLs have already provoked in the NFL , teams are going to have to start coming up with more creative ways to make money . <p> " The personal seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every community , and I do n't think it 's going to happen in every community , " Tagliabue said . <p> " It happened in the Carolinas because they basically made a decision as a community that there would be a user fee imposed on the public and it was n't a personal-fee license , it was a permanent fee , " Tagliabue said . " A permanent-seat license in the Carolinas is viewed by the fans as a permanent investment in an NFL franchise , and a user fee which privatized the cost of building a stadium . <p> " If you get into personal seat licenses , which have involved relocation costs and other things , then I think there is a backlash because people are being asked not to build a stadium privately . They 're being asked to pay other costs and other debts of the team , and I think that produces a backlash and people are going to find that hard to deal with . " <p> But PSLs , personnel or permanent , are not what 's causing the growing disparity between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " It 's not so much the seat licenses , " he said . " I think the revenue disparity comes from No. 1 , size of market , No. 2 , the terms of the stadium lease , and No. 3 , the fact that in a sports league , you 're always going to have losing teams by definition . <p> " You ca n't have a league of all winners . Half the teams are always going to be losers and they 're going to go through down-cycles in terms of fan interest , down-cycles in terms of revenue , and that 's what you have to address through your revenue sharing . <p> " Overall , " Tagliabue said , " I think we have a very strong league . We share 60 percent of our revenue equally through our television contracts . That 's a tremendous subsidy for the smaller and mid-size markets to the big cities . No other league has that kind of stability built in , and I think that gives us a leg up on every other league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but stadium revenue is . <p> That 's why more than half the teams in the league are presently working toward new or improved stadiums under new and improved leases . <p> " Part of it is being driven by baseball to have single-use stadiums , " Tagliabue said . " We 're competing with baseball and we 're competing with the NBA and the NHL , and we all have to have good facilities . Part of it is the fans . The fans see outstanding facilities like Camden Yards in Baltimore and Jacobs Field in Cleveland , Coors Field here , and they then have a different level of expectation in terms of what they want out of a sports facility . <p> " The fans are great here , and Mile High Stadium has been great . But I think a lot of people who have shared the stadium experience here with Coors Field , or some of the other newer facilities , see that each generation brings things to a new state of the art and you ca n't stay forever with 30- and 40-year-old stadiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tagliabue said . " We 're looking at two major areas of economic pressure in the NFL today . <p> " One is the escalation of player costs . The free agency and the porous nature of the salary cap has created problems and , coupled with that , we 've had some growing disparity of revenues . So you have some teams becoming have teams , and some teams becoming have-nots . <p> " The other thing is we , in all sports , are competing ever more intensively . You have four major-league teams in this area now . That 's true in a number of areas of the country where previously you only had one or two major franchises . <p> If there is a monster in all of this , Tagliabue said , it 's the salary cap or rather the way some owners have used monstrous signing bonuses to circumvent the cap and move the price of wheeling and dealing for marquee players out of the small-market owners ' league . <p> " I do n't know that it 's been a failure , " Tagliabue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It got us back to the playing field with labor peace . <p> " It does n't seem to have negatively affected the play on the field . The game on the field is stronger than ever . <p> " But what it 's doing is eroding the financial equality that we 've had for so many years that enabled clubs to compete for the long term , and it raises the real prospect that high-revenue teams will be dominant on the field and average , lower-revenue teams will be has-beens on the field . <p> But that , too , Tagliabue said , is a correctable problem . <p> " We 're talking with the union right now about modifications to this labor agreement and an extension of this labor agreement . <p> " But there are two major problem areas , " he said . " One is the porous nature of the cap , the circumvention techniques that have emerged , none of which was ever anticipated and certainly was not part of the deal . The second aspect of it is revenue-sharing , so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a few teams that have a lot of revenue , and then the lower-revenue teams have to spend against a benchmark that they ca n't meet . " <p> That , more than personal seat licenses , has created an instability that is no longer acceptable in the league . <p> " I think there are some solutions , and I think there are solutions with stability , " the commissioner said . " We know how critical it is to have stability . It 's always been a key part of the NFL , and I think we will continue to work with that as our goal , and I think we can accomplish that . New stadiums will have to be part of it . "
