The prologue to the latest novel by the master of horror Pre The world had teeth and it could bite ys with them anytime it wanted . Trisha McFarland discovered this when she was nine years old . At ten o'clock on a morning in early June she was sitting in the back seat of her mother 's Dodge Caravan , wearing her blue Red Sox batting practice jersey ( the one with 36 GORDON on the back ) and playing with Mona , her doll . At ten-thirty she was lost in the woods . By eleven she was trying not to be terrified , trying not to let herself think , This is serious , this is very serious . Trying not to think that sometimes when people got lost in the woods they got seriously hurt . Sometimes they died . All because I needed to pee , she thought ... except she had n't needed to pee all that badly , and in any case she could have asked Mom and Pete to wait up the trail a minute while she went behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise that was , and that was why she had dropped behind a little bit , and without saying anything . That was why she had stepped off the trail and behind a high stand of bushes . She needed a breather , simple as that . She was tired of listening to them argue , tired of trying to sound bright and cheerful , close to screaming at her mother , Let him go , then ! If he wants to go back to Malden and live with Dad so much , why do n't you just let him ? I 'd drive him myself if I had a license , just to get some peace and quiet around here ! And what then ? What would her mother say then ? What kind of look would come over her face ? And Pete . He was older , almost fourteen , and not stupid , so why did n't he know better ? Why could n't he just give it a rest ? Cut the crap was what she wanted to say to him ( to both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce had happened a year ago , and their mother had gotten custody . Pete had protested the move from suburban Boston to southern Maine bitterly and at length . Part of it really was wanting to be with Dad , and that was the lever he always used on Mom ( he understood with some unerring instinct that it was the one he could plant the deepest and pull on the hardest ) , but Trisha knew it was n't the only reason , or even the biggest one . The real reason Pete wanted out was that he hated Sanford Middle School . In Malden he 'd had it pretty well whipped . He 'd run the computer club like it was his own private kingdom ; he 'd had friends-nerds , yeah , but they went around in a group and the bad kids did n't pick on them . At Sanford Middle there was no computer club and he 'd only made a single friend , Eddie Rayburn . Then in January Eddie moved away , also the victim of a parental breakup . That made Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of kids laughed at him . He had picked up a nickname which he hated : Pete 's CompuWorld . On most of the weekends when she and Pete did n't go down to Malden to be with their father , their mother took them on outings . She was grimly dedicated to these , and although Trisha wished with all her heart that Mom would stop-it was on the outings that the worst fights happened-she knew that was n't going to happen . Quilla Andersen ( she had taken back her maiden name and you could bet Pete hated that , too ) had the courage of her convictions . Once , while staying at the Malden house with Dad , Trisha had heard their father talking to his own Dad on the phone . " If Quilla had been at Little Big Horn , the Indians would have lost , he said , and although Trisha did n't like it when Dad said stuff like that about Mom-it seemed babyish as well as disloyal-she could n't deny that there was a nugget of truth in that particular observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily worse between Mom and Pete , she had taken them to the auto museum in Wiscasset , to the Shaker Village in Gray , to The New England Plant-A-Torium in North Wyndham , to Six-Gun City in Randolph , New Hampshire , on a canoe trip down the Saco River , and on a skiing trip to Sugarloaf ( where Trisha had sprained her ankle , an injury over which her mother and father had later had a screaming fight ; what fun divorce was , what.really good fun ) . Sometimes , if he really liked a place , Pete would give his mouth a rest . He had pronounced Six-Gun City " for babies , " but Mom had allowed him to spend most of the visit in the room where the electronic games were , and Pete had gone home not exactly happy but at least silent . On the other hand , if Pete did n't like one of the places their Mom picked ( his least favorite by far had been the Plant-A-Torium ; returning to Sanford that day he had been in an especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing his opinion . " Go along to get along " was n't in his nature . Nor was it in their mother 's , Trisha supposed . She herself thought it was an excellent philosophy , but of course everyone took one look at her and pronounced her her father 's child . Sometimes that bothered her , but mostly she liked it . Trisha did n't care where they went on Saturdays , and would have been perfectly happy with a steady diet of amusement parks and mini-golf courses just because they minimized the increasingly horrible arguments . But Mom wanted the trips to be instructive , toohence the Plant-A-Torium and Shaker Village . On top of his other problems , Pete resented having education rammed down his throat on Saturdays , when he would rather have been up in his room , playing Sanitarium or Riven on his Mac . Once or twice he had shared his opinion ( " This sucks ! " pretty well summed it up ) so generously that Mom had sent him back to the car and told him to sit there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trisha wanted to tell Mom she was wrong to treat him like he was a kindergartner who needed a time-out-that someday they 'd come back to the van and find it empty , Pete having decided to hitchhike back to Massachusetts-but of course she said nothing . The Saturday outings themselves were wrong , but Mom would never accept that . By the end of some of them Quilla Andersen looked at least five years older than when they had set out , with deep lines grooved down the sides of her mouth and one hand constantly rubbing her temple , as if she had a headache ... but she would still never stop . Trisha knew it . Maybe if her mother had been at Little Big Horn the Indians still would have won , but the body-count would have been considerably higher . This week 's outing was to an unincorporated township in the western part of the state . The Appalachian Trail wound through the area on its way to New Hampshire . Sitting at the kitchen table the night before , Mom had shown them photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hikers either striding along a forest trail or standing at scenic lookouts , shading their eyes and peering across great wooded valleys at the time-eroded but still formidable peaks of the central White Mountains . ete sat at the table , looking cataclysmically bored , refusing to give the brochure more than a glance . For her part , Mom had refused to notice his ostentatious lack of interest . Trisha , as was increasingly her habit , became brightly enthusiastic . These days she often sounded to herself like a contestant on a TV game show , all but peeing in her pants at the thought of winning a set of waterless cookware . And how did she feel to herself these days ? Like glue holding together two pieces of something that was broken . Weak glue . Quilla had closed the brochure and turned it over . On the back was a map . She tapped a snaky blue line . " This is Route 68 ; " she said . " We 'll park the car here , in this parking lot " She tapped a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaky red line . " This is the Appalachian Trail between Route 68 and Route 302 in North Conway , New Hampshire . It 's only six miles , and rated Moderate . Well ... this one little section in the middle is marked Moderate-toDifficult , but not to the point where we 'd need climbing gear or anything " She tapped another blue square . Pete was leaning his head on one hand , looking the other way . The heel of his palm had pulled the left side of his mouth up into a sneer . He had started getting pimples this year and a fresh crop gleamed on his forehead . Trisha loved him , but sometimes-last night at the kitchen table , as Mom explained their route , for example-she hated him , too . She wanted to tell him to stop being a chicken , because that wa what it came down to when you cut to the chase , as their Dad said . Pete wanted to run back to Malden with his little teenage tail between his legs because he was a chicken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Trisha , did n't even care if being with Dad would be good for him in the long run . What Pete cared about was not having anyone to eat lunch with on the gym bleachers . What Pete cared about was that when he walked into homeroom after the first bell someone always yelled , " Hey CompuWorld ! How , va doon , homo-boy ? " " This is the parking lot where we come out , " Mom had said , either not noticing that Pete was n't looking at the map or pretending not to . " A van shows up there around three . It 'll take us back around to our car . Two hours later we 're home again , and I 'll haul you guys to a movie if we 're not too tired . How does that sound ? " Pete had said nothing last night , but he 'd had plenty to say this morning , starting with the ride up from Sanford . He did n't want to do this , it was ultimately stupid , plus he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they have to spend a whole Saturday walking in the woods during the worst time of the year for bugs , what if Trisha got poison ivy ( as if he cared ) , and on and on and on . Yatata-yatata-yatata . He even had the gall to say he should be home studying for his final exams . Pete had never studied on Saturday in his life , as far as Trisha knew . At first Mom did n't respond , but finally he began getting under her skin . Given enough time , he always did . By the time they got to the little dirt parking area on Route 68 , her knuckles were white on the steering wheel and she was speaking in clipped tones which Trisha recognized all too well . Mom was leaving Condition Yellow behind and going to Condition Red . It was looking like a very long six-mile walk through the western Maine woods , all in all . At first Trisha had tried to divert them , exclaiming over barns and grazing horses and picturesque graveyards in her best **30;45;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simply sat in the back seat with Mona on her lap ( her Dad liked to call Mona Moanie Balogna ) and her knapsack beside her , listening to them argue and wondering if she herself might cry , or actually go crazy . Could your family fighting all the time drive you crazy ? Maybe when her mother started rubbing her temples with the tips of her fingers , it was n't because she had a headache but because she was trying to keep her brains from undergoing spontaneous combustion or explosive decompression , or something . To escape them , Trisha opened the door to her favorite fantasy . She took off her Red Sox cap and looked at the signature written across the brim in broad black felt-tip strokes ; this helped get her in the mood . It was Tom Gordon 's signature . Pete liked Mo Vaughn , and their Mom was partial to Nomar Garciaparra , but Tom Gordon was Trisha 's and her Dad 's favorite Red Sox player . Tom Gordon was the Red Sox closer ; he came on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sox were still on top . Her Dad admired Gordon because he never seemed to lose his nerve " Flash has got icewater in his veins , " Larry McFarland liked to say-and Trisha always said the same thing , sometimes adding that she liked Gordon because he had the guts to throw a curve on three-and-oh ( this was something her father had read to her in a Boston Globe column ) . Only to Moanie Balogna and ( once ) to her girlfriend , Pepsi Robichaud , had she said more . She told Pepsi she thought Tom Gordon was " pretty good-looking . " To Mona she threw caution entirely to the winds , saying that Number 36 was the handsomest man alive , and if he ever touched her hand she 'd faint . If he ever kissed her , even on the cheek , she thought she 'd probably die . Now , as her mother and her brother fought in the front seat-about the outing , about Sanford Middle School , about their dislocated life-Trisha looked at the signed cap her Dad had somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought this : I 'm in Sanford Park , just walking across the playground to Pepsi 's house on an ordinary day And there 's this guy standing at the hotdog wagon . He 's wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt and he 's got a gold chain around his neck-he 's got his back to me but I can see the chain winking in the sun . Then he turns around and I see ... oh I ca n't believe it but it 's true , it 's really him , it 's Tom Gordon , why he 's in Sanford is a mystery but it 's him , all right , and oh God his eyes , just like when he 's looking in for the sign with men on base , those eyes , and he smiles and says he 's a little lost , he wonders if I know a town called North Berwick , how to get there , and oh God , oh my God I 'm shaking , I wo n't be able to say a word , I 'll open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry squeak , what Dad calls a mousefart , only when I try I can speak , I sound almost normal , and I say ... I say , he says , then I say and then he says : thinking about how they might talk while the fighting in the front seat of the Caravan drew steadily farther away . ( Sometimes , Trisha had decided , silence was life 's greatest blessing . ) She was still looking fixedly at the signature on the visor of her baseball cap when Mom turned into the parking area , still far away . ( Trish is off in her own world was how her father put it ) , unaware that there were teeth hidden in the ordinary texture of things and she would soon know it . She was in Sanford , not in TR90 . She was in the town park , not at an entry-point to the Appalachian Trail . She was with Tom Gordon , Number 36 , and he was offering to buy her a hotdog in exchange for directions to North Berwick .
