SEPTEMBER 17-24 , 1994 The ticking of the Pentagon 's clock has reached an unmistakable decibel level , and for anyone who wants to get into Haiti now , there are the lucky few and the unlucky many . A handful of government-selected pool reporters will be coming in with the troops , issued helmets and flak jackets , and helicoptered ashore ; thrown , intimately but anonymously , into whatever midnight horror or glory awaits the landing force . Everybody else  --  hundreds of journalists from around the globe  --  will have to find their way onto an island ostensibly under a red alert , its air and sea routes disconnected , its mountainous border with the Dominican Republic watched by uniformed criminals , and its countryside controlled by paramilitary militias armed with machetes and guns . By September 17 , the travel agencies ferrying the media from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince , a sweltering daylong journey , are overwhelmed ; the sun-baked border crossing at Jimani clogged with harried legions of reporters , photographers , cameramen , technical crews , fixers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought over by bands of screaming porters ; the road gridlocked with convoys of vans and flatbed trucks hauling satellite dishes , generators , warehouse loads of electronics , lighting and sound equipment , videotape , and bottled water ; everybody slick with sweat , pissed off , and verbalizing in half a dozen languages , peeling hundred-dollar bills off their bankrolls ( ten grand in hard cash , minimum , if you are working for a major news organization ) , and each one of them determined to be the next guy through , to beat the troops into Haiti , to pass through the looking glass into the surreal , topsy-turvy world of war . I , too , am desperate to get in , and for days I languish in Santo Domingo , trying to get my documents in order , hearing about attempts by other reporters to buy their way in , about the Dominican soldiers wearing CBS caps , about the three Agence Presse Francais reporters who , after bribing the Haitian border guards a thousand bucks each ( all bribes by nature nonrefundable ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to Port-au-Prince . Or about Ed Barnes , Time 's war correspondent , who , with two other journalists , was nabbed sneaking over the border at Pedernales , a more obscure crossing on Haiti 's south coast , and returned at gunpoint to the guard post where , for twenty minutes , Haitian soldiers discussed the pros and cons of accepting Barnes 's offer of a massive bribe before marching the trio back across no-man's-land . You 've got to be kidding , Ed protested , the most corrupt country in the world and we ca n't buy our way in ? This is fucking outrageous . In Santo Domingo , I hear the border is closed , the border 's open ; the border 's never been closed , it 's only become more unpredictable , all you need is a visa from the Haitian embassy ; good thing you did n't go to the border yesterday , serious trouble up there , amigo  --  the Haitians are robbing and arresting reporters . Meanwhile , Jimmy Carter has looked into the eyes of General Raoul Cedras 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed at the airfield in Port-au-Prince and are standing around waiting , ripening anxiously in the sun . A few days later , in the smoky twilight of the afternoon , I arrive by bus at the post-apocalyptic outskirts of Port-au-Prince , having traveled the breadth of the Haitian countryside without spotting any sign of the U.S. military occupation . At first glance , nothing much has changed , I decide , since my first visit to Haiti in 1986 , when I reported on the aftermath of the dechoukaj , the nationwide rebellion that ousted Baby Doc Duvalier and the regime 's paramilitary enforcers , the Tonton Macoutes . Vast areas of the cityscape seem constructed out of shortcuts and makeshift solutions , erected by the homeless for the homeless , creating the smoldering architectural temperament of a dream constantly solicited and constantly deferred , competing chronologies of decay arbitrarily overshadowed by the paternalism of the government ministries , the neocolonial fraud of their timelessness , imposing facades flaking mustard-colored paint chips onto unkempt lawns . Unlike Havana , neglect has not rewarded Port-au-Prince with its own aesthetic , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the international airport , the bus seems momentarily swallowed up by a poltergeist , pitching and vibrating with a concussive rhythm churned down on us from a covey of Blackhawk helicopters dawdling overhead . In front of us , the roadside flow of pedestrians has coagulated along a cinder-block wall , and there is now an unfamiliar weight in the air , a strange tension of violently mixed emotion  --  suppressed hate , rapture , disbelief , fear  --  and here , finally , are the troops , armed to the nines and hunkered down beneath sandbag igloos along the perimeter of the airfield , their helmeted faces nervously scanning the crowd , which stares back with hyper-focused inertia , mesmerized , as if the marines are walrus and this is a movie . I stare , too , never having seen an American soldier in full battle dress , let alone seventeen thousand of them deployed in a theater of operation . We pass on into the downtown neighborhoods , eerily empty , the streets banked high with rotting garbage , wandered by pariah dogs and pigs ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. warships to ascend , with nightfall , the incongruously named Avenue sweeter air of Petionville , the notorious suburb of privilege , carved into the mountainside above the darkening city . Within ten minutes I stand in the illuminated lobby of the Montana Hotel , space-warped into an apres-beach party , gawking at the throng of media celebs , the Eddie Bauer tropical fashion show , the crush of machos at the bar in shorts and network caps , looking as if they 've spent their day playing softball . On the patio , CNN is feeding a satellite ; in the lounge , a big-screen TV broadcasts the Michigan-Colorado game . Reporters for the dailies stand in line at the phone links , computers in hand ; when I find my way downstairs to the apartment rented by the Miami Herald , where I 've been offered sleeping space on the floor , three Herald reporters , Susan Benesch , Peter Slevin , and Yves Colon , are similarly engaged , seated around a dining room table , hushed and intent , squinting at their screens , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a chair . Reservations for dinner are made . The embargo 's impact on one 's opportunity for fine dining in Petionville is zero . Souvenance , the restaurant of choice for the capital 's aristocracy of crisis ( the politicians and millionaires , the well-heeled gangsters , the diplomats and journalists ) , is booked up , and so we settle for the gastronomic artistry of the chef at La Plantation , where the clientele can fill their glasses with the best French wines to toast the continuing  --  and , in some cases , karmically inexplicable  --  miracle of their survival . Except for the hotels , the military barracks ( or casernes , as they 're called in Haiti ) , and those homeowners who can afford a generator , the entire country has gone without electricity for months . I ride with Yves and Peter through the blacked-out labyrinth of streets , slowly resigning myself to the fact that I am terrified to be moving about the city 's corpse-strewn nighttime . We become lost , make a wrong turn , and end up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our headlights , raising a rifle . " Back up , " I hear myself pleading , but Yves calmly rolls down his window and asks for directions . At the restaurant , I marvel at how , given the tropical latitudes , one glamorous venue is much like the next . We could be in Coral Gables or St. Tropez , but instead we are in Haiti ; and what the ruling class can not seem to grasp , either in 1986 or in 1994 , is that if , after a coup d'etat , the incoming regime had exhibited one trait more mature than the insatiable egocentrism of infants , one guiding principle more enlightened than avarice or venality , if they had only bothered themselves to do one thing for Haiti more constructive than exert authoritarian control  --  just one : fixed a pothole , picked up the trash  --  then Aristide would be history , Cedras would n't be looking for real estate in Panama , the marines would be back at Camp Lejeune , and the putschists would still be riding high in the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , stowing millions into offshore accounts . But no lust is as beguiling , no mistress as treacherous , as unmitigated self-interest . On the way out , someone recognizes the acting prime minister 's deputy , and , pausing at his table , we learn that while we 've been at the restaurant , a marine patrol in Cap-Haitien , the country 's second-largest city , five hours north , has opened fire on police headquarters . The Immaculate Invasion now has a body count . Ten . SEPTEMBER 25-30 , 1994 After a week 's occupation , the capital has not yet afforded itself the highly combustible luxury of imagining it has been liberated . Just what are the Americans up to ! everyone wants to know . It is as if the United States believes that the mere presence of its armed forces is somehow therapeutic . For months the generals have been pumped up for an invasion , high-tech slaughter , another victory for the microchip , and at the last conceivable second have been told to change the software , uncock the gun  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the Atlantic Command might need a few days to reshape its thinking to this unprecedented circumstance is certainly reasonable to assume . But what is the causal relationship between role and pace ? Why , as the timetable expands , does the mission seem to shrink ? Even post-Carter , is n't this still Operation Uphold Democracy ? Okay , so everybody from Clinton on down through the chain of command is winging it , yet no one is asking General Cedras to fall on his sword , let alone beat it into a plowshare , and the immunity granted his various legions of thugs seems , inexplicably , unlimited , as long as no one points a gun at a kid from Kansas . The Americans , it appears , are practicing an abnormally benign form of coercion , as if finesse alone will win the day and the dictatorship will dismantle itself because it is the right thing to do . In Port-au-Prince , no one can say for certain what is going on . The city squirms , its eagerness to abandon the deaf-and-dumb act tempered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Haitian military , Forces Armed de Haiti ( FADH ) , inhabit their casernes , the police play dominoes in their stations , and the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti ( FRAPH ) , the paramilitary militia masquerading as a nationalistic political party , still owns the streets . FRAPH  --  a far-right organization with a widely reported link to the CIA  --  is to the regime what the Brown Shirts were to Hitler  --  provocateurs , terrorists . Meanwhile , the Americans drive past in their Humvees without stopping , the marines are reluctant to come away from the waterfront and airfield , and you never see a soldier after dark , when the Macoutes and other assassins materialize like vampires to hunt their prey . Because of the Americans , the world seems suspended in volatility , neither what it was nor what it intends to be once Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns , if he ever does . On my first morning , I venture with Yves and two other reporters into the festering slum of Cite Liberte , the address of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regime as hit men . It is an odious honeycomb of colorless blocks connected by a grid of dirt alleys , where lethal games of hide-and-seek are a nightly occurrence . My level of apprehension is modest compared with what we now observe on the faces of a platoon of U.S. soldiers , one of the first foot patrols dispatched into the city , fly bait trying to walk down the street . Escorted by the noisy crowd  --  hundreds of people  --  the soldiers rotate their bodies like automatons , some walking backward , some straight ahead , their eyes stark with fear , their rifles leveled for firing . Yesterday 's killing of ten policemen in Cap-Haitien becomes easy to visualize . " Have you seen anybody carrying weapons around ! " one of the soldiers asks the crowd , not realizing that the question itself is a form of incitement . " Yes ! " everybody screams in unison . The names of the guilty become a tangle in the air . An hour later I am sitting in the backseat of Ed Barnes 's four-wheel-drive Mitsubishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our creole interpreter ; Susan and Ed are up front , and we are headed out of town . Our reckless five-hour drive north coincides exactly with the collapse of the Haitian state , invisible from within Port-au-Prince yet increasingly evident and lively as we drive farther into its exorcism . Rounding the shoreline of the immense blue gulf responsible for the open-jaw shape of Haiti , we pass on our left a mangrove swamp that reeks with muddy decay ; on our right , sad denuded highlands , eroding into the sea . Gas is plentiful in the cities despite the embargo , though its black-market price  --  $15 a gallon  --  discourages all but the most affluent or desperate . Except for an infrequent taxi , known locally as a tap-tap , clinging with passengers and piled high with cargo , we soon have the road to ourselves , though the roadsides are another matter , a continuous stream of farmers astride donkeys , women with buckets and pans balanced on their heads , bicycling teenagers , ragged children , chickens and goats and cowering dogs . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race past turquoise water , postcard beaches that once hosted a long-defunct tourist industry , past a Club Med abandoned for most of a decade . Then the road takes us inland to the more familiar habitations of the masses  --  mud-and-wattle huts with thatched roofs , densely built in tribal clusters ; two-room block houses with tin roofs ; clapboard shanties  --  and finally to the city of St.-Marc , where we are greeted with puzzled but nevertheless instinctive respect by the uniformed policemen manning their checkpoint ; they do not try to stop us as we barely slow to weave through their barrier of oil drums positioned across the road . On the opposite side of town , the highway rolls us out into the Artibonite Valley , Haiti 's breadbasket , its vast expanse of malarial rice paddies ready for harvest by the peasant collectives . The richness of the land , however , exists in inverse proportion to the impoverishment of the road , Route 100 , the main artery between Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien , constructed by the U.S. Marine Corps in the 1920s . This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swerve through the splatter of axle-breaking craters . I have never traveled a road in greater disrepair , its bed so severely exposed that the pavement appears to have been the target of low-altitude cluster bombing . Where the irrigated plains end , the arid , treeless savanne desolee begins , a Nevada-like vista surrounding the equally destitute ugliness of Gonaives , a city impossible to imagine ever being beautiful , regardless of its historic importance  --  home to Haiti 's two-hundred-year-old revolution , site of the 1985 uprising that became the dechoukaj but never came close to defeating Duvalierism . Approaching Gonaives 's central crossroads , we can see the intersection blocked by several thousand people , who react as though they 've been waiting all day for our arrival . Unable to go on , we are mobbed by cheering demonstrators , the heat of their jubilation pressing in on us , and I am momentarily unnerved by their crush , the passionate intensity of their dancing , of which we seem to be the sole catalyst . I scan the side streets , half expecting the FADH to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the crowd sings in a single , chanting voice . " Long live the Americans ! Long live Aristide ! " They want us to follow them up the street ; the demonstration doubles in size as we park in front of the FADH caserne , where , to our surprise , we are welcomed by Major Mark O'Neill , the commanding officer of the 105 Special Forces soldiers who yesterday took over the town . O'Neill , relaxed and amused , Gonaives 's new king of carnival , has to shout to be heard above the crowd , which grows more raucous by the second , taunting the unarmed Haitian soldiers who stand sullenly at the entrance to the barracks . " I 'll tell you , " says Major O'Neill , smiling broadly . " The Haitian soldiers are as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof . I told the Haitian commander here I 'd do the same thing the marines did up in Cap , and that energized him to put the word out not to carry weapons . I 'm here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find anyone carrying a firearm , I 'll take that gun and shove it up his ass , sir . " O'Neill beams , even as the crowd grows bolder , and he sends a combat-ready trio of his men out front to pacify them . Despite his nonchalance , the major has to acknowledge the high probability for chaos in Gonaives , which is why he is in no rush to run around disarming attaches . He controls everything from the city out into the central district , and right now he is ready to sleep with the devil , he says , to maintain order . " I do n't get paid extra for glory . " You can almost smell the soap on O'Neill ; he is that clean , that happy , out here in the Third World being of use to mankind . I feel as if I am standing at the center of a fabulous though potentially fatal eruption , battered by euphoria . Nor does this sensation wane as we continue onward , ascending into the spectacular mountains of the north , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each village and town we enter , each successive population thronging the road to cheer us , as if it has fallen to us to ignite the fires of their celebration , as if we have somehow saved them . Ed Barnes , who during the Gulf War witnessed the liberation of Kuwait City , ca n't help but notice the parallels  --  the deserted checkpoints ; the abandoned police posts ; the dazed assemblies clogging the road , pinching themselves awake at the sight of us , white and foreign , then roaring with screams of elation , the effect like spontaneous combustion ; and the air throbbing with drums and horns , the primitive atonal music of the bands a pie . We begin waving back like dignitaries , shamelessly saluting the manifestations with raised fists . I wo n't deny the element of self-preservation in my motive , since I saw these same youthful flocks , in these same rural towns , blocking these same stretches of road in 1986 , only the boys were armed with machetes then and not so happy . Which , incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pass through the colonial gates of Cap-Haitien , the city once touted by the French as the Paris of the New World , now a virtual junk heap , wrecked by decades of criminal neglect . Several blocks before the first roundabout , we come to a halt on the edge of pandemonium : a large agitated crowd and , at its convulsive core , a knot of berserk men screaming in creole , " Lie down flat ! Lie down flat ! " Susan and Ed climb out on the roof of he Mitsubishi for a better look . The people have caught an attache and are ripping him to pieces ; we can see the red cap of his bloody skull , distinct among the sea of angry faces , lurching forward like a deer being brought down by a pack of wolves . " Lie down flat ! " the crowd demands , savoring its power to say these heartless words , the same command customarily given by attaches before they put a bullet in the back of your head . Ahead , across from the roundabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T formation and manned by a platoon of clench-jawed marines , their M-16s leveled , the carriers ' mounted machine guns trained on the crowd , the gunners wide-eyed as the mob inches toward their position , cordoned off with razor-sharp loops of concertina wire , clubbing and pummeling its victim , swiping at him with machetes until he manages to stumble to the wire , where the troops pull him in as he collapses to his knees , raining blood . " Viv le demokrasi ! " the people shout . Two of the avengers have wrapped themselves in American flags . Others wave swatches of the Haitian red and blue  --  France 's tricolor flag with the white symbolically removed . With the sun about to set , the colors glow , the dread becomes buoyancy , and to me the city 's ambience could n't possibly be more profound  --  old gods toppling into the dirt . With newfound exuberance , hundreds of people press around our car , singing , removing pictures of Aristide from their Bibles , their wallets , testifying , denouncing . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's an attache named Champagne . He has weapons . You must go get him . " They take it as an article of faith that we are inseparable from the force in the world that has been sent by God to deliver them from evil , and I suppose that is more true than I am willing to admit ; as I look into their black faces , their hope is so thorough and consuming it frightens me . Traffic begins to move again , and we advance deeper into the lawless city , its void of civic amenities , its locked gas stations and grim warehouses , an open-air market selling every bicycle ever thrown away or stolen in Miami . A few blocks from the harbor , we park inside the high walls of the Hotel Roi Christophe , a former palace built for Pauline Bonaparte when Napoleon sent his brother-in-law and an army of sixty-five thousand men to put down Haiti 's slave rebellion . The ride north has been like five hours on a mechanical bull , and now we want to walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central plaza , one side of it occupied by the FADH garrison , which we soon learn was stormed by a mob earlier in the day . Its five-hundred-man contingent of Haitian soldiers tore off their own uniforms and disappeared into the slums , fearing that the marines would come on the heels of the crowd , as they had the previous night at the police headquarters , and shoot them dead . Come they did , but too late to prevent the demonstrators from trashing the caserne . The American guards posted behind the barred gates are wired , anticipating nightfall . All afternoon people have been bringing them weird booty : officers ' uniforms straight from the dry cleaners ; bag-like hoods used during torture sessions . Susan and I continue on , hoping by chance to interview the Haitian commander of the entire northern region , Lieutenant Colonel Josaphat , who resides in the handsome estate house under the palm trees on the opposite end of the plaza . The light , like a Flemish painting 's , seems golden-brown and heavy . We make a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's place and stop in front of an extraordinary roadblock , constructed out or dented tubas , a disassembled trombone , a trombone case , and palm fronds . Behind Josaphat 's wrought-iron fence , a marine hunkers down in a pod of sandbags , manning a machine gun set on a tripod . " Keep moving , " he says . " You ca n't stand there . " But Colonel Josaphat is n't there , he is n't anywhere ; he has slipped away like a serpent into the bush , betrayed by the universe . Begging the gunner 's patience , we stare for another minute at the mystery of the brass roadblock , then wander into the dreamland of the plaza 's shady park , its lawn whitened by a snowfall of sheet music , thousands and thousands of yellowed , hand-ruled pages increasing in density until we are wading in them ankle-deep , coming to a bandstand in the center of the green , its wooden closet busted open and spewing antique scores . I stoop to pick up a handful : " That 's My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the " U.S. Field Artillery March , " lovingly penned in india ink . Haiti , framed at both ends of the twentieth century by the music of military occupation . Night brings total darkness  --  no electricity , no phones , no water in the city . We take the last two rooms at the Christophe . A generator coughs into operation , bringing light until 10:30 ; Henri , the proprietor , finds an aluminum ladder for Susan , who sets up her satellite phone on the roof . We order dinner  --  the choice is beef or lobster  --  shower cold , and sit on the tiled terrace to eat , pampered by a sweet romantic breeze and contraband beer . Outside in the darkness the air begins to compress ; the ice water in our glasses trembles . The American helicopter seems to originate in my subconscious ; but then it is suddenly there , close above us but unseen , an airborne locomotive with a voice  --  some psy-ops wizard broadcasting a screech of comforts and warnings : All is well . We 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear noise in the night , do n't come out . In the morning , a few blocks down from the hotel , there is a man in the street , beaten to death during the night . A few hours later , I stand in the anteroom of Cap-Haitien 's newly liberated prison . Outside , in the courtyard , a column of smoke rises from a mound of documents and files : records of arrests . People drag us eagerly from cell to cell , pantomiming the miseries endured : Here they would burn you alive , here they would beat you with batons , here they would cut you . The tiny cement rooms are windowless , smell of urine , and contain sad curls of shit . Scratched into the grimy walls are graffiti , mostly prayers and day counts , names of lovers  --  drawings executed with lumps of charcoal : Baron Samedi with top hat and frock coat , lord of the cemetery . The parade ground is scattered with rubbish , junked cars , things smashed long ago . Women fill plastic jugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear out every last piece of wood , indifferent to the furious sputtering harangue of an organizer from Lavalas , the grass-roots political movement that swept Aristide into power in 1990 . " Do n't do dechoukaj , " he shrieks , " because Lavalas gets blamed for it . If you dechouke the prison , you 're the same as the attaches , you put a bad image on Aristide . " Then , as if he were invincible , L'Overture , a notorious Macoute , saunters forward to proclaim he would rather lose his mother than have Aristide come back to the country . His hubris is breathtaking  --  people step back from him , their faces averted , their eyes gone blank . " He 's too strong , " someone mutters . " Too strong . " At the police substation next to the city gates , the doors are askew on their hinges , windows unshuttered . Street kids have the run of the building , and I am spellbound by their matinee performance , a spontaneous opera bouffe : they 've donned calabash-shell helmets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their " commander " rages into a toy phone , making flamboyant gestures of intolerance ; his arrogant aide-de-camp transmits from an imaginary radio while on the veranda the troupe conducts mock beatings to the general amusement of the crowd watching from across the street , prevented only by their timidity from joining the fun . In a tyrannized population , it 's the felicitous spirit of the imagination that first springs free , giddy and victorious , on the day of liberation . Along the unpaved road to Grande Riviere du Nord , forty-five minutes southeast of Cap , attack helicopters swoop low overhead , casting dragon shadows on the green hillsides , rising and dipping with the contour of the land . There 's going to be trouble , we say to ourselves , knowing only that teams of marines are doing quick strikes throughout the countryside , disarming the casernes . Now I understand I am in a war zone without the war , more than an exercise , less than combat  --  a tricky , high-stakes , ill-defined game between superior American forces and a multilayered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere we go  --  for instance , this morning to Don-Don and St. Rafael , two villages deep in the countryside  --  we become the catalyst for the first mass demonstrations in three years , orgiastic eruptions : love-in , song fest , road band , dance competition , shouting-match festivals of finger-pointing , upheaval , and blanc veneration . It 's the same throughout Haiti as the Special Forces eddy into the provinces . Back in the States at the networks and metropolitan dailies , the foreign desks are already jaded by the story : Okay , peasant revelry . Got it , ran it . What else is going on ? So far the Haitian citizenry has been playing a high-risk sport , each manifestation flirting with the edge , careening out over the lip of the abyss and then jitterbugging away at the last moment , high on the thrill . We , too , are exhilarated by the daily arc toward violence , the centrifugal sense of escape ; yet it is a bum-out game , however real , and catastrophe never seems genuinely aborted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , perhaps ! September 30 will mark the third anniversary of the coup d'etat . Aristide 's supporters are planning nationwide demonstrations , widely expected to test Lavalas 's commitment to nonviolence and reconciliation . Can they really behave themselves ? Inquiring minds want to know . A Reuters team tags along with us throughout the morning ; the photographer , a grumpy action-junkie named Lee Celano , is seriously ill with a respiratory grunge being passed around the press corps . My diagnosis is walking pneumonia . We encourage him to medivac out to the USS Comfort , a hospital ship anchored off Cap-Haitien , for treatment , but Celano is pigheaded , married to the shoot , and will only agree , reluctantly , to be dropped off at the hotel for some bed rest . Afterward , we give ourselves the afternoon off as well , driving down the coast to Combier Beach , a classic Caribbean hideaway , one of the few resorts left in Haiti , the proprietors an industrious French couple who keep their towels fresh for the tourists who never come . Jean-Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leading businessmen , is visiting ; naturally , we want to hear his opinion of the occupation . During the past year , he says , " Everyone agreed the Americans destroyed the country . Everyone-the peasants , the elite , the merchants , Lavalas . " But Carter has been a great success , he adds , and the marines , despite their arrogance ( and the indiscretion of killing ten cops ) , are n't making mistakes . The Marine Corps , in fact , is going home , we discover in the morning , handing over the operation to the 10th Mountain Division , the Army 's urban-warfare specialists , recent graduates of the University of Futility , Somalia campus . Out on the pier we bump into Colonel John McGyre , who has spent the week trying to locate the Haitians in charge of Cap-Haitien 's power and water systems , but they are all in Port-au-Prince . McGyre figures he 'll have to rebuild Cap-Haitien from the ground up , which is why he has brought with him to Haiti the phone book from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a city of sixty thousand people needs in the way of administrative and civil services . " I did n't know where else to look , " he says . There it all was in the phone book , the master plan , listed under " City Government " : Water Department , Sanitation , Fire Department , Sheriff , Education , City and County Police . But once the colonel landed in Cap , he looked around and said to himself , Boy , this is n't the way it works back in Bryant , Texas . Do n't expect too much too fast . On the long miserable drive south to the capital , we again pass through Gonaives , where all 150 CARE canteens have been ransacked by hungry mobs . Talking with the Special Forces at FADH headquarters , we learn that in Port-au-Prince Cedras confederates chucked two grenades into the midst of a demonstration celebrating the reinstallment of the city 's mayor , Evans Paul , a charismatic hero who had gone underground , rather than into exile , after the 1991 coup . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U.S. troops chased the attackers into a warehouse , machine guns blazing , then stood by as an enraged mob ransacked the building . We drive on . Until the morning of September 30 , the nature and intent of the American crusade is something of a riddle , its posture nothing if not oblique . Haiti 's unique pathology seems to have stumped , or at least divided , the policy gurus and strategists back in Washington , and in Port-au-Prince the popular belief in rescue-by-superpower is severely dampened by the U.S. military 's ambivalence about its mission . More than twenty thousand servicemen are now in situ , almost exclusively in Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince , occupying not the cities themselves but their entrances  --  harbors , waterfronts , airports  --  and shuttling convoys back and forth between the encampments . With increasing frequency but little effect ( except for the incident in Cap-Haitien ) , foot patrols and then motorized platoons begin to probe the city in a " show of force , " but the statements are too localized and transient , and the bigger show remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is to say , the signs of improvement in Port-au-Prince are too subtle to recognize , and the situation is basically unchanged . Descending Avenue John Brown from Petionville into the city , however , Susan and I are quickly required to think otherwise . Port-au-Prince is definitely occupied , ripe with tension , and the objective of the U.S. military is now conclusive  --  to protect the rich people up on the mountainside from the wrath of the hundreds of thousands of poor people in the slums below , whom the troops have ostensibly come to liberate . Driving off the slope separating Petionville from the commercial center of the city , we come to a halt at the first intersection , our way blocked by three Sheridan tanks nested in concertina wire , fortifying a checkpoint barricade . Tanks on urban street corners have a mammoth and sinister presence , in this instance lovingly articulated by the inscriptions see painted on cannon barrels : BAD KARMA ; HOUSE OF PAIN . Nonsense ends right here . A dozen blocks farther down the avenue , we are waved past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkpoints , no troops . In the inflamed heart of the city , no security beyond that which the U.S. Command has deluded itself into believing the Haitian police force will provide . " Deluded , " however , is perhaps an incorrect characterization . From the looks of it , the American military , ever resistant to finding itself caught in the middle of Haitian-on-Haitian violence , has decided that today in Port-au-Prince all hell will break loose , the masses are bound to rampage , and to attempt to prevent the tempest is imprudent but to contain it divine ; and so they have cordoned off the city , dividing it between the haves and the have-nots , and are waiting , as though Port-au-Prince were ... well , I suppose the model is Los Angeles . Anarchy has its limits . Let it blow , but preserve the ruling class or kiss civilization and service good-bye .

" Veye yo "  --  Be on guard  --  the crowd on the steps of the cathedral advise one another . In the aftermath of the dechoukaj in 1986 , attaches developed an especially wicked habit of assassinating Aristide supporters during , or immediately following , church services . Lavalas marshals frisk us as we pass through the doors . A herd of cameramen prowl the aisles . Instead of incense , I smell whiffs of sewage drifting in from the street . Undercover security agents on loan from various embassies are posted at strategic points throughout the cathedral , whispering into their shirt collars . Worshipers hold up xeroxed images of Aristide and don handmade Lavalas headbands . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " what do you want ? " " Democracy ! " the people roar . " Give up the power that 's not yours , " the priest cries back , words meant for the Haitian military . A young man distributes handouts arguing for a truth commission . A tiny peasant woman , wearing a simple housedress and a camouflage head scarf , threads her way down the aisle , carrying a placard heartbreakingly made with a piece of cardboard box and packing-crate sticks . Pasted to the placard are pictures of Aristide and of her two sons , showing the funeral of one and the other lying in a terrible pool of blood . One was killed for wearing a picture of Aristide ; the other , for sticking pro-Aristide posters on a wall . Somebody in one of the back pews lets loose with a long , piercing cock 's crow , and everybody cheers : one of the symbols for Lavalas is a rooster . I step outside for a smoke . Choppers circle overhead . Rick Bragg , a New York Times reporter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , dressed as Lavalas supporters . What the people are doing inside the church would have gotten them killed two weeks ago . After communion and a final benediction , people exit the cathedral to begin the march , five thousand or so strong , only a fraction of what organizers hoped for , yesterday 's grenade attack having kept everyone home . The Miami Herald team has split up along the route ; I drive away with Yves Colon , planning to jump ahead of the marchers somewhere along the Rue de L'Enterrement  --  Burial Street . Turning back uptown toward the National Palace , we park in front of the penitentiary , one block over on a street parallel to the parade route . A cluster of uniformed policemen hang around the prison entrance , advertising their worthlessness . These are Lieutenant Colonel Michel Francois 's men . Francois is the ruthless police chief of Port-au-Prince , directly responsible for much of the state-sponsored violence in the capital , and the tacit master of the attaches . Only now , as we walk up to the corner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Yves fully realize where we are . " Oh , " he says , frowning , " this is a FRAPH street . " I probably would have figured it out myself from the overpowering hostility of the men loitering in front of the shops . FRAPH 's office and hangout  --  the Normandie Bar  --  are one block up , just past the intersection we are walking toward , where it seems the march has stalled . We slip into the crowd of demonstrators packing the intersection , which is about to become , in a few minutes , no-man's-land . Several hundred marchers have already passed beyond the Champ du Mars , but not before a FRAPH thug has grabbed the cage of doves and wrung the birds ' necks . The vast majority of demonstrators are stopped on the other side of the intersection , strung out along the Rue de L'Enterrement , waiting patiently to advance , not yet cognizant of what is happening up ahead . Suddenly the sky above the intersection grows dark with a hailstorm of rocks pitched by brazen demonstrators toward their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin roofs , banging like gunshots . Then , in the enfilade of noise , there is the more distinct crack of a real gun being fired . Yves and I flinch , seeing the bullet skid along the pavement , kicking up sparks . I look up the Champ du Mars toward FRAPH headquarters and see men with pistols walking toward the intersection , toward us , rocks jumping off the street like popping corn . The demonstrators begin to edge back , picking up rocks strewn throughout the battle zone . Like everyone else , Yves and I edge along with them until , a few yards ahead , at the nucleus of the crowd , another blast of gunfire sends us running , panic-blown , back down the street . On the opposite side of the street , the police watch the scene from the top of the prison wall , waving at us , shrugging . The next thing I know the crowd has retreated so far that Yves and I find ourselves in its front ranks . Shots explode so close I am swept into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sixty of us falling like dominoes into a narrow darkness between houses . When I pry myself free I am outraged to find a thief attached to me , his hand trapped in my pants pocket . I grab his wrist and snatch my money out of his hand , cursing him as the most shameless man in the world . Turning away from the pickpocket , I am horrified to see a man being beaten to death right in front of me . I watch the spray of blood from his head as sticks smash his skull , the dervish whirl of the mob , the way the man falters and falls and leaps to his feet and runs a few steps and dies . Then , like a gust of wind , the mob is pummeling another man , blood streaming down his face , then pummeling an NBC cameraman trying to protect him as a CNN cameraman presses so close to the action that blood splashes across the lens of his camera , across television screens around the world . Someone tells me the first man beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing his pistol , but then his bullets ran out and the crowd closed back in on him . Now shooting breaks out all over my area of the block . Two people near me are wounded  --  one in the leg , the other a young boy whose arm seems to have been hit by birdshot . Suddenly Susan is by my side ; she has come recklessly across the intersection from the other side , but just as she tells me this we lose each other as the FRAPH gunmen launch another assault up the street , firing away . I see her fly into an alley as I run and dive through the back window of another journalist 's car just as it is peeling out . Down at the next intersection , I get out and am able to see that the attaches now have control of the block , they are trashing the march organizers ' flatbed truck , chopping its loudspeakers with clubs and machetes , shooting out its tires . One FRAPH guy wields , of all things , a barbecue fork . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd bravely , foolishly , charges again , then the street erupts in cheers because behind us an American patrol has arrived . They stop one intersection down and scrutinize the bloody scene , but in fact they 've made a wrong turn , this is not where they want to be , and they drive off , leaving the demonstrators to choke on their bitterness . " The Americans and FRAPH are twins , " people begin to shout up and down the street . For twenty minutes , the attaches dare not shoot for fear the troops are still in the vicinity . During the lull , I make my way back to the Lavalas truck , but then the gunfire starts up again : a man up at the corner , in a crouch , is firing his rifle at us . I have no choice but to dash with dozens of others into an alley . Shutters bang closed as I sprint back to where the alley opens into a warren of shanties . I stop there , afraid to go farther . I inch back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have blocked off with a rusty sheet of tin . " Do n't go back out , it 's too dangerous , " a teenage boy begs me , but I feel trapped and claustrophobic . Straight out the street is deserted , but when I peer around the wall , I see Peter Slevin hurrying past . I remove the tin and hurdle behind a porch wall , Peter sliding in beside me . He has just run from another alley , where two students sheltered him ( both now dead in the dirt , Peter will later learn , executed at point-blank range ) . Another flurry of shots nearby , cameramen hustling to their vehicles to strap on flak jackets , and then a kid , weeping , shrieking through his tears , " They shot an American journalist ! They shot him in the head ! " flees down the street like a jackrabbit . The news is too much for the demonstrators . There i5 a final clash ; a ball of blue smoke floats to the street from atop the walls of the penitentiary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes a lasting stillness , the crowd 's courage broken and its heart defeated . The Red Cross ambulances arrive to haul off the casualties : eight dead , twenty wounded . Lee Celano , the ill photographer who was with us up in Cap , will be going out to the USS Comfort after all , with a FRAPH bullet wound to his head . Back where we 've parked the car , Yves says , " Let 's go talk to the guys in the penitentiary . " " Not me , " I say . " They just tried to kill us . " I sit alone for a minute , dull with hatred and fear , but then I feel compelled to join him at the prison 's steel doors , to look into the eyes of wickedness as it utters lies . " What demonstration ? " the police answer us . " What rocks ? What shots ? We 're just the jailkeepers here . " At the afternoon 's military press briefing , a roomful of smelly , frazzled journalists holler at the spokesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our mission is not to serve as the police force , " Willey keeps repeating ; security for the march is the responsibility of the Haitian police force . " Who is in control of the Haitian police ? " a reporter demands . Schrager shrugs and tells the truth . " Nobody , " he says . An NBC cameraman loses his cool and has to be ushered outside by his colleagues . Transformed into words and images , the bloodshed is already in the air , being delivered stateside to the dinner table of public opinion . Tomorrow , of course , the military 's policy toward armed gunmen will change , redefined by the imperatives of circumstance rather than principle . By Sunday the five-star hotels will begin to empty out as the networks reassign people to the O. J. Simpson trial , which has bumped Haiti as the lead story . III . DE OPPRESSO LIBER OCTOBER 1-15 , 1994 Port-au-Prince and the Haitian government are in suspended animation , their vital signs barely perceptible ; no one is making much of an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlying towns and villages , however , democracy is being served piecemeal wherever the Special Forces  --  the Peace Corps with guns , some call them  --  have deployed . So I 've decided to drive to the city of Limbe , eighteen miles south of Cap-Haitien , where I 've gotten to know a fourteen-man Special Forces detachment , led by Captain Edmond Barton . There the FADH ran away , Barton 's detachment moved right in , and now I hope to move in with them to watch them grapple with the tricky process of nation building , which will keep them in Limb at least until next March . However much spin the White House and Pentagon put on it , however much they declare it is so , the U.S. militant operation in Haiti is no more multinational than the Republican Party is multicultural , so I think it curious , the day I return to Limb , that I 'm not the only outsider requesting Captain Barton 's permission to move into the caserne with the Special Forces . I arrive at the same time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rucksack . " Where 'd you come from ? " I ask . " I 'm not here , " he says affably . " I do n't exist . " " You 're imaginary ? " " Yes . I 'm sure of it . " Okay . Understood . I can appreciate his logic since , according to the Army Times , the Special Forces are n't here either . " Well no , it is not exactly like that , " the imaginary colonel elaborates . " I am here in Haiti , but I am not here . I am actually in Port-au-Prince . " In Port-au-Prince , the colonel 's official self twiddled its thumbs at the Joint Special Operations Task Force Command . The ranking officer of a commando team sent to Haiti to protect his government 's consulate and evacuate French citizens during the American invasion , the colonel quickly found himself afflicted with inactivity , and , after two weeks contemplating the unwarranted swagger of the American high command and the clement challenge of their minimalist campaign , he made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up with the Green Berets , the only soldiers really doing anything on the island . Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel David Schroer , who is now chewing out Captain Barton , has taken a chopper out to inspect his detachments scattered throughout the countryside ; the French colonel hitched a ride . Judging from everyone 's hardened demeanor , the lieutenant colonel 's inspection tour is unannounced and unwelcome . Gone from the team members is any fraternal bon-homie , the effortless but surefooted professionalism , the cavalier disregard for the perils of schmoozing with journalists . Today , they are dour , stone-faced , regulation-issue grunts . First , the lieutenant colonel dumps on the NCOs for having jungle sleeves  --  their shirt cuffs rolled up above their wrists-an exceedingly petty dress-code violation in a zone of conflict , especially in the tropics , but for older officers this obsession with uniforms is a legacy of Vietnam , the first sign of a breakdown in discipline . Second , the lieutenant colonel fries Captain Barton 's ass in a skillet . What is the captain doing ? the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is n't he running joint patrols out to the other towns in his district ? Why has n't he told the people here to clean up their marketplace ? It is a goddamned eyesore . Why has n't he set an example by policing his own compound ? It is a garbage pit . The detachments in Gonaives and Grande Riviere du Nord are operating balls-out while here in Limbe everybody is daydreaming . If the captain ca n't do his job , the lieutenant colonel warns , he 'll get somebody else out here who will . Haiti is thirty-year-old Barton 's first command in the field , and he is , despite the callous set of his jaw , stupefied by the lieutenant colonel 's excoriations , which are fundamentally uninformed , unrealistic , and unjust . There are solid reasons for the captain 's dilatory pace , more than even Barton himself is aware of . He does n't know , for instance , that , unlike the Special Forces in Gonaives and Grande Riviere , he is starting from scratch , in control of the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their post . Nor does Barton know that for a week the other units have been patrolling their outlying areas in Humvees , whereas Barton 's pair of Humvees have been airlifted into Limbe only yesterday . Today , he loads them up with men and sends them out on recon , and if you give him the heavy equipment necessary to scrape up the years of accumulated filth in the marketplace , fine , but it is n't going to get done without a front loader and a dump truck , and as for the mess in the caserne , guilty as charged , but he needs authorization to hire laborers . Lieutenant colonels , however , fly around in helicopters to approve results , not listen to captains whine about their problems , so this lieutenant colonel gets back in his Chinook and leaves . At ease , Captain Barton glares into space , spits , cusses . He deserves a measure of sympathy . He grew up mostly in Kentucky , graduated from Officers Candidate School , and went to Fort Bragg , but no matter how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier for a mission like Haiti , or a Kentucky boy for a place like Limbe . He is , much to his distaste , the contemporary version of a Roman procurator , the sole authority over the lives of three hundred thousand people living under primitive conditions in a mountainous , isolated **29;242;TOOLONG administrative district . This is n't Pandora 's box , it is her warehouse , chock-full of the urgent banalities and minutiae of civic dispute . The incessant arguments started the first morning , when two different guys showed up to claim ownership of a bicycle left behind in the caserne , and it has n't stopped since , a twenty-four-hour-a-day yammer . Anybody with a grudge against his neighbor denounces him as a Macoute . The Special Forces have lost count of how many times the rules of engagement have changed in the past five days . And no matter what the Army claims about the linguistic versatility of its Special Forces , the Limbe detachment 's collective knowledge of French wo n't get them fed in a Parisian bistro . There are moments when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoveling a century 's worth of corruption out of the stalls . How perverse symmetry is , to be the source of both beauty and irony . The caserne I have moved into was built by the marines during the 1915 occupation , one of the outposts from which they cruelly stamped out the Caco Rebellion , a revolt by forced-labor road builders against U.S. forces , restored power to the elite mulatto families in Port-au-Prince , and trained a national army that eventually became the FADH and brutalized the population for seven decades , until the marines returned . The architecture is simple  --  a long shed-like structure facing the marketplace ; thick concrete walls , the front higher than the back so that its tin roof slopes downward toward the rear of the compound , its outbuildings , mess hall , and rubble-strewn , chicken-pecked open ground circumscribed by high walls . You enter the caserne at its middle , and ten good steps will take you through to its back exit . A jail cell and , behind that , an arsenal occupy its right half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the communications specialist , Sergeant Jim Pledger , has set up his radios and satellite phone ; behind the bullpen is a small office , and farther left , in the remaining third of the building , is a small barracks crammed with four double-decker metal bunks , rucksacks , and MRE ( Meal Ready to Eat ) cartons . It is here , on the bare wire webbing of one of the upper bunks , that I stow my gear . Outside , there is a huge cieba tree , and in its shade a row of wooden chairs , where Barton and the imaginary colonel are receiving visitors , delegations , complainants , claimants , job seekers , AWOLs , dignitaries , scam artists , and madmen . Right now , they seem to be holding an encounter session with ten or so members of Haiti 's Generation X. These guys , I am told , are the Committee of the Young , a local Lavalas student group . " They 're trying to assert some level of authority , " says Sergeant Bill Miatke , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students all their lives . They 're too good to hold a job because they 're educated , and they 're basically a pain in the ass . " When the sun goes down , the Special Forces crank the diesel generator , the only electricity in town , except for the Baptist Hospital . In the mess hall I eat my first MRE  --  chicken a la king , peanut butter and crackers , beverage base powder , a bar of Charms candies . I run into Sergeant Bill Collins , the team 's medic . " We 're not here for just a cosmetic screw-up . We 're here , " Collins says wryly , " for the long-term screw-up , the whole system  --  we 're going to get it all . " Collins is the youngest member , twenty-five , of the detachment ; Sergeant Ernie Brown is the oldest  --  thirty-seven . Ernie is black ( with Cherokee blood ) , big , and , by his own admission , beautiful . Tomorrow he 's in charge of the first re-supply mission to Cap to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin replacing the collateral damage caused by the downwash from the helicopters . Not only did the choppers knock down all the walls at the soccer field ; houses all over town have had their roofs blown off . Ernie makes a list of material ; someone reminds him to add chicken wire to stretch over the open casement windows in the barracks . " Grenades , " Ernie explains for my benefit . The soldiers could close the shutters , but it 's too hot . Later , when I climb up on my bunk , which is only a few inches below one of the open windows , I 'm just too tired to fret about grenades and take my cue from the fatalistic snores of my barrack-mates . " If somebody really wants to do it , " they told me , " it 'd be the easiest thing in the world to take us out . If you 're unconventional forces , it comes with the turf . " I 'm most worried by the thing that most worries them  --  getting hit by sniper fire when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the slit-trench latrine . Which is what happens that same night to a Special Forces soldier at the caserne in Les Cayes , on the southern coast . Shot in the back while taking a dump . Throughout the night the radios fizz ; men coming off watch duty quietly rouse their replacements . The night achieves a measure of serenity impossible to imagine in daylight . The next morning I find Captain Barton and the imaginary colonel out back under the powwow tree , their heads together , building a mutual wavelength for their already remarkable collaboration . Since the Army has n't seen fit to provide Barton with an interpreter , the imaginary colonel , whose English is flawless , is heaven-sent . But the imaginary colonel , as translators go , is n't particularly conscientious ; not only does he seem especially receptive to Haitian circumlocution but he loves to talk himself , and often forgets that the captain is sitting there , in Barton 's own words , " like a pig staring at a wristwatch , " without a clue . Even if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barton 's laundry list would still be ridiculously formidable : 1 . Clean up the marketplace ( to placate the lieutenant colonel ; forget it ) . 2 . Cooperate with the FADH ( only there is no FADH in Limbe ) . 3 . Rebuild a local security force ( out of the general population , if he has to , says the lieutenant colonel ; only Barton ca n't pay them and he ca n't arm them unless they 're already officially armed , so he 'll have to find trustworthy people he can persuade to risk their lives during this tumultuous transitional period simply for love of country alone , which , naturally , not many are eager to do ) . 4 . Recon all the other towns , villages , hamlets , and outposts in the 53rd District , assess each one 's security needs , and make contact with all the chefs du section ( the infamous rural sheriffs , who have a reputation for ruling their isolated sections like medieval fiefdoms ) . 5 . Whatever it takes , no matter the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , last , and foremost , get all of his men home alive . And so the improvisation of Haiti , and the micro-liberation of its 53rd District , begins . In the military argot of the day , Barton and his men separate the population into two classes : the " goodies " and the " baddies . " However murky the line between the two , certain assumptions and guidelines apply . For better or worse , and with the exception of bloodthirsty punks urging the crowds to violence , Lavalas and its members are goodies . Until proven otherwise , all elected and/or appointed officials are goodies . Because of the shootings at police headquarters in Cap , all Haitian cops are baddies ( though in the northern districts this is a moot category , since all the police are in hiding ) . At least in the 53rd District , all FADH deserters who persist in their desertion will be presumed baddies , but any FADH soldiers who remain in their casernes , or any who are willing to show Barton an I.D . card and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches and so-called Macoutes may or may not be baddies , depending on the evidence , who 's denouncing them , and why . The chefs du section they 're not sure about . Barton and the Special Forces also are perplexed about FRAPH , a confusion exacerbated by the commanding officer of the Special Forces , Colonel Mark Boyatt , who 's been preaching to his troops that democracies ca n't function without a loyal opposition , and in Haiti , says Boyatt , FRAPH should be regarded as the loyal opposition . This reading is n't a very precise , subtle , comprehensive , or even knowledgeable analysis of the forces at play in Haitian society , but it dares to clarify a mission that , from a soldier 's perspective on the ground , is precariously vague . It also allows the captain and the imaginary colonel to formulate , optimistically , a plan for the construction of a Haitian security force that , if properly conceived , will render the American military presence superfluous , so that everybody can go home . The gist of the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mix of the old and the new . Eight each  --  a balance of FADH goodies and Lavalas goodies . Barton and the colonel will select the FADH ( if they ever return ) ; meanwhile , they will prompt the notables in Limbe and Plaisance and wherever else there is a FADH caserne in the district to convene town meetings , select candidates for a transitional police force , present them to the population , and let the people vote on their acceptability . Voila ! How do you like your democracy ? Raw . No sooner have the captain and the imaginary colonel finished explaining the scheme to me than they are given the opportunity to float it before some potential participants , people whose fate rests on the success of this improvised version of reconciliation . We rise to shake the hands of the delegation from Plaisance : the huge , bald-headed , light-skinned mayor , a quintessential politician with a molasses smile , caressing us with flowery French phrases ; the short , lean , dark-skinned FADH commander of the Plaisance caserne , a quintessential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratiating himself to the invaders . With him are two junior officers ; all three are dressed as civilians . Everyone sits down , and the imaginary colonel outlines the proposal . The FADH officer  --  a lieutenant  --  bounces in his chair , waiting for his chance to respond . " If you mix new Lavalas police with remnants of the old security forces , " the lieutenant is finally able to say , his body language as animated as his voice is passionate , " we must sleep together , and there is so much hate , the Lavalas people will kill us as we sleep . " Instead , the delegation requests daily U.S. patrols in Plaisance ; Barton can only sigh and explain that he lacks the resources for anything more than intermittent visits . In the meantime , Barton says , he wants them back in uniform and back in their caserne . Hearing this , one of the junior officers jumps up in disgust . " I do n't think it will work your way , " says the lieutenant , " but if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caserne . You should understand , however , that Haiti is not a civilized country . " Now the petitioners are lined up , waiting for an audience with the captain and the imaginary colonel under the powwow tree , which I 've discovered has a duck residing in the base of its hollow trunk . Next in line are the leader of the Youth Committee and a small , gentle-mannered man who says he was the Aristide-appointed delegat to Limbe , come out of hiding after all these years , and he is eager to take control of the town 's affairs . The aggressive Youth Committee leader makes a similar bid for a piece of the action . The captain snorts . " He wants money , " summarizes the imaginary colonel , " and he wants power , and tomorrow he maybe wants to kill people . " Barton tells the pair he 'll call a town council meeting this afternoon , which they are welcome to attend . Inside the tree , the duck quacks . The town hall is in an advanced state of disrepair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water damage , yet there has been an attempt to salvage its dignity with gray and yellow paint , the visages of former mayors hung on the walls , and its chairs and benches are sturdy , arranged in a semicircle around a simple wooden table where Barton and the colonel take the seats offered them . The mayoress , Madame Bruno , has the shape and disposition of a cannonball . The justice of the peace is a tall , frail old man with a missing leg . The headmistress of one of the local schools for forty years , Madame Bazin is a paragon of bourgeois femininity , though her bun wig is a bit lopsided and her purse is noticeably empty . Unlike Madame Bruno , Madame Bazin easily succumbs to the flattery of the imaginary colonel , the smoky sensuality of his voice . Almost everybody else in the room is from Lavalas , crammed onto the benches , squeezed solemnly against the walls , and their presence throws Madame Bruno into a snit . She growls at the delegat when he attempts to hug her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't sit , until finally the imaginary colonel seduces her with her own importance , and then she sits , but the chair wo n't contain her ample bottom and must be exchanged for another , wider one . " There 's a security problem that we want you , the notables and elected officials of Limbe , to solve , " the imaginary colonel begins . The captain sits impassively , his M-16 propped against his chair , and lets him talk , and it is spellbinding , the colonel 's speech , his manner , delicately but systematically milking the venom from the fangs of the serpent . Drop by drop , he drains the room of acrimony until these bitter adversaries  --  the past and the future , face to face for the first time in three years  --  are each mollified , and then , by paying tribute to the formal hierarchy  --  justice , mayor , delegat  --  he begins to gather a consensus out of the din of vigorous argument . Finally , everyone agrees to work together to build a new police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process among themselves , then meet with the captain and colonel again on Wednesday . " Now , " says Madame Bruno , peering through the oversized frame of her designer eyeglasses , " we have beaucoup problems here in Limbe . " She wants a truck to haul town trash to the dump , she wants the canals dredged and cleaned because they 're malarial , she wants electricity , she wants ... Barton stops her , tells her to make a list , and emphasizes tke importance of identifying problems that affect only the community , not individuals . " Please , Captain , " Madame Bazin says , pursing her withered lips , " no more helicopters over the marketplace . " After the meeting , Barton feels the urge to stroll around town , which he has n't seen much of , having been " too busy wracking my brain back in the compound . " Although he 's worried about putting untrained people on the streets as cops , he 's upbeat , relieved that there were no demonstrations at the town hall . He picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives it to one of the little boys in our entourage , who laughs at its worthlessness . Despite the tropical backdrop , the desolation of the neighborhood we walk through reminds me of Aristide 's bleakly realistic goal : " We will move from misery to poverty with dignity . Newly inspired by the American intervention , the citizens of LimbE have begun to sweep the streets with frond brooms . Farther down the road , there 's a group of women on the stoop of their house , eating sugar cane , and the captain asks if he can try a piece , earning an unexpected cheer of approval from the crowd of onlookers . " The American soldier eats with us ! " people cry to one another , amazed , because the Haitian military , afraid of being poisoned , would never eat anything the population offered them . The next day , although they 're mightily concerned about being ambushed along the way , the captain and the imaginary colonel are taking the Hearts and Minds Show on the road . I climb into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two team members , a driver and a security backup , ride in front . I 've traveled the length of Route 100 three times , but the officers have never been out on it before , and they make me nervous , shifting seats according to the contour of the terrain , scanning the ridgetops and roadside for snipers . At the village of Camp Coq , halfway between Limb and Plaisance , a large manifestation has closed the highway , the elated crowd bouncing to the feverish rhythm of homemade trumpets and drums , chanting a " Cedras Go Eat Shit " song . We pull off to inspect the tiny caserne they 've thoroughly trashed , and , quite by coincidence , two more Humvees  --  the first American military traffic to take the road north from Gonaives  --  arrive from the opposite direction , carrying Barton 's superior , the lieutenant colonel , who jumps out to a flurry of salutes . A Lavalas marshal blows a whistle to make the crowd settle down so that the American soldiers can talk . The lieutenant colonel asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in the marketplace , he advises Barton , " and tell the people we 're not here to give you food . We 're not here to give you money , we 're here to help you reestablish your government , but if you 're going to go crazy , we 're not going to help . " Set up a court and jail for criminals , but send the politically motivated troublemakers to Port-au-Prince . " You can pick out the bad guys on the street , " the lieutenant colonel says . " They wear fresh clean clothes , Ray-Bans , and a lot of gold jewelry .... Everyone 's anxious to get this ball rolling and get these places stabilized in the next six or seven days because Aristide 's return will be a very destabilizing thing . " Behind the officers , the demonstrators quietly hold up a blackboard chalked with demands and pleas . A sad-looking man asks me to help him chase away an attache named Innocent , who has kept him out of his own house for two weeks . The crowd adulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves and blows kisses . Barton looks glum ; I suspect the lieutenant colonel 's gotten to him again , but that 's not it . " We 're a sign of hope , " he says , " but it 's a lot of false hope , for what these people really think Aristide and we can do . " The town hall of Plaisance is insufferably hot , pungent with the smell of unwashed bodies and overstuffed with humanity , the road outside pooled with spectators . As in LimbE , the imaginary colonel 's oratory soothes the many-voiced beast ; the contending factions come to terms on the process of composing a new police force : the first selection will be made by the population , the second selection by Captain Barton , the third by the United Nations . As in Limbe , with the dispatch of the business at hand , the dynamic of the meeting regresses to its more natural state  --  passionate shouting , wild gesticulation , denouncements and overwrought appeals . Like flash fire , the bloom of hatred consumes the room 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to be a clairvoyant to see the aura of death haloing some of the speakers , to know there are people here who wo n't survive the days until Aristide 's second coming , and I shudder at the bravery of the young man who steps forward to hand Captain Barton a list of armed attaches and FRAPH hoodlums he alleges are continuing a reign of terror in Plaisance . During lunch , one of the Special Forces members makes a postcard by cutting a square out of his MRE box , then addresses it to President Clinton at the White House : Dear Bill  --  Having fun in Haiti . Wish you were here . Just looking forward to Nov . Elections . Love , Middle-aged Republican . It 's no exaggeration that many of the troops do n't like Clinton , but their disapprobation pivots on a single issue  --  gays in the military . In the detachment , they bitch about missing deer season in North Carolina , missing being with their families for the holidays ; they bitch about the ineptitudes of Command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ordered , by any president , into a theater of operation , does n't matter where , and , without being indecorous , they 're proud to be doing what they 've been trained to do . They know why they 're in Haiti , even if the folks back home do n't . Without guile or quixotic naivete , and with a growing , if not yet full , appreciation for the political and moral ambiguities of the mission , they say it : " We 're here to free the oppressed . " De Oppresso Liber is the motto of the Special Forces . And in Haiti , a place not unlike , say , the state of Mississippi in 1866 , that motto applies . But is Haiti worth one American soldier 's life ? The soldiers do n't ask the question . This afternoon , we 're off the pavement , headed deep into the countryside on a torturous , kidney-jarring dirt road to " liberate " a string of mountain towns  --  De Gobert , Margot , Pilate  --  places abandoned by Port-au-Prince , invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another continent . Despite its isolation , the Haitian outback is densely populated ; throughout our slow hour-and-a-half drive to Pilate , the road is continuously lined with peasants running from their huts and gardens to cheer and applaud us , dancing spontaneous jigs , dashing after the Humvee to shake our hands , waving their straw hats in the air , mile after mile , chanting , " Blanc ! blanc ! blanc ! blanc ! Oui ! Oui ! Oui ! Merci ! Merci ! " " Now I can begin to imagine the joy of the soldiers entering Normandy , " says the imaginary colonel . Arriving in Pilate , something happens that astounds us , something we will never forget . As we come over a hill that drops us , unexpectedly , into the center of town , we come face to face with a funeral procession . The street is filled with mourners , women shrieking with grief , sad old men shuffling behind the pine box coffin carried on the heads of two pallbearers . We stop , they stop . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a reality blackout , the mourners zapped with a thousand miraculous volts of revelation . Then it 's as though someone flips a circuit breaker . The funeralgoers shake their heads clear of disbelief and reinvent themselves in one great big convulsive boom of elation , whirling one another around like children on a playground , the old women hopping in the air with their arms fluttering above their heads , frisky old men skipping in the dirt , and the pallbearers , their black faces sequined with light , dance onward to the cemetery , the coffin dipping and rolling above their heads like a rowboat on the open sea . This is freedom to the unfree , its first sip so intoxicating it transforms funerals into celebrations . While American-enforced entropy continues to slowly unravel the regime , decentralization has its own organic counterforce . Daily events in the countryside bunch together in an accumulation of chaotic emotions , shifting power , and soaring anticipation , gaining momentum and weight , threatening to reach critical mass on October 15  --  the day Aristide is to step off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on Special Forces holding a town in the central plateau . Six FADH soldiers have cast their fate with the Special Forces and are now back in uniform , living inside the compound . One of the district 's forty-eight chefs du section comes in from the bush , begging Captain Barton to allow him to keep his job . " When you catch a thief , do you beat him up ? " the imaginary colonel asks him . " No , not too much , " the fellow replies . A camp toady is running a collateral-damage scam out of the caserne , coaching his pals outside the walls of the compound on how to file false claims with the military . A box of crisp , wonderful apples arrives with the resupply from Cap-Haitien . At lunch in the mess hall , we listen to disconnected statements from Washington on a shortwave radio belonging to one of the soldiers . When the lieutenant colonel next drops by , there are two standoffish spooks in his entourage who remain out by the gate . I ask the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for U.S. AID , " he says . I walk out to ask the pair themselves , who both wear blue jeans and polo shirts . " You guys reporters ? " They glance at each other and snicker . " Yeah , " they say , " we work for Rolling Stone . " " The LC told me you 're AID . " " Nah , we work for the embassy , " they say , but when I ask about Stanley Schrager , the embassy spokesman , they do n't know who he is . Never mind . The imaginary colonel makes each of the new civil inductees sign an oath of service , which the captain has composed and copied on his laptop computer . The air is tangy with sweat and sweetened by beautiful singing chat wafts down from the nearby cathedral . Madame Bruno is more congenial , wearing a sailor-cut white dress with blue polka dots ; her community-projects shopping list contains thirty items : a jeep , a truck , two new schools , a kids ' library , a new abattoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is experiencing " mission itch " ; his orders from Command  --  " to provide a safe and secure environment "  --  are wide open for interpretation , and that irks him . " I think what we 're doing is a model , " the imaginary colonel says to bolster him . It 's true : Limbe 's the first place in Haiti to try to form a new security system , and there are no more mass demonstrations in the market , no boiling crowds . Still , they both fret that somewhere along the chain of command someone 's going to undo what they 've accomplished . Despite appearances , the imaginary colonel 's affection for the Haitian people is genuine , and it depresses him to entertain the notion that he might be colluding in a double cross . Unfortunately , the officer 's concerns seem justified , because the manner in which they 've begun to redistribute power on the ground , on the grass-roots level , seems to contradict American policy , the big picture . The fact is , Washington apparently does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policymakers intend to manipulate a stasis , into which they 'll insert Aristide and their own will . There 's a Special Forces major , a specialist in civil affairs , who has just arrived in Gonaives and rented an entire fleabag hotel for his team for three months . I find myself hoping he has brought something to read , because , except for letting the Army 's engineers repair the existing electrical and water infrastructure , there are not going to be any community projects in Haiti  --  one of the specialties that the Special Forces excel in . At night , Sergeant Miatke sits on the front steps of the caserne , holding class with ten happy attentive town kids . English-creole lessons and stories from American history . I put on a pair of NODs ( Night Observation Devices ) and watch the lunatics and evangelists who haunt the marketplace after dark ; the technology makes them appear washed in flickering phosphorescence as they flail about the stalls . A woman squats to urinate , and the piss comes out from between her legs like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life ? " one of the kids on the steps asks me in Spanish . When I lie on my bunk for my nightly exercise in sleep deprivation , a bat lands on my pillow . Sergeant Jim has two radios going all the time ; neither of them works right . They make a noise like aerosol cans sprayed in bursts . With every sunrise comes a file of people straggling in from the countryside with tales of treachery and disaster . Hourly , it seems , there are casualties , many brought bleeding to the caserne . In Port Margot , an attache has been murdered . In a place called Le Borgne , up on the northwest coast , everybody is attacking one another . I ride with the captain and the imaginary colonel from town to town ; everywhere we go we start a mini-riot , confiscate a pile of weapons , and spend the next hour calming everyone down . If there 's serious trouble , we 're on our own , since the field radio in the Humvee does n't work once we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attache militias regrouping in the countryside . Sergeant Walt Cline practices knife fighting in the compound . " That 's not something you really want to do , is it ? " I ask him . " No , " he says , " but I do n't want to be caught short . " He has a degree in literature ; Donald Hall is his favorite poet . In the middle of the day , at an outdoor nightclub in Plaisance , thirty-one candidates are presented to the population , who will approve eight for the new police force . There 's an uproar when the candidates learn that there 's no money involved , but the mayor placates them by saying the American captain will give them some food , clothes , shoes . Most of the candidates are students ; a few are teachers . One declares he wants to serve his country ; he is soundly applauded . Another ca n't seem to explain himself when somebody identifies him as FRAPH , and in the ensuing clamor he 's lucky to get out of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the imaginary colonel . A Special Forces soldier guarding the Humvees takes a grenade off somebody in the crowd . The line we walk seems to get thinner every day . We eat lunch , and children fight over our MRE trash , licking the plastic containers . " Who knows where this thing will go ! " Captain Barton muses . Smoke , lending a dream-like texture to the air , is now a constant in Limbe as the population gets serious about cleaning up the town for Aristide 's return . With machetes , they hack down all the trees along the roadside , because Command has told Captain Barton to clear the power lines so that electricity can be restored to the area . The defoliation gets out of hand . Schools have reopened , mothers pedaling their children in the mornings on bicycles . The police chief of Port-au-Prince makes a dash for the Dominican border and is granted asylum . A letter arrives from Port Margot saying that the FADH deserters from Cap-Haitien are organizing in the vicinity , please come to protect us because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands to see Captain Barton because someone killed his two pigs . Barton 's frustration is starting to grind him down . Finally he shouts , " Everybody wants some fucking thing I ca n't give . Everybody wants a soldier to be stationed in their goddamned house . " Finished ? No . " This new police force is a joke , " he adds , and then retires to his bunk . A voodoo priest comes to the gate ; he wants a job as an informant . Madame Bruno has added a teen club and electric outlets for her office to the wish list . " Is midnight basketball on that list ? " Sergeant Bob Fox wonders . The town of Bas-Limbe requests an immediate response to its earlier request to be rescued from a plague of attaches . " We 'll go over there and give them the democracy speech , the Aristide speech , the peace and reconciliation speech , buy off a few more days , and come back , " says the captain . " The egg is coming back to the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals who , after their 1991 coup , told the population that Aristide had no more chance of returning to Haiti than an egg has of returning to its source . In Le Borgne , three hours away on a virtually unpassable road , tucked back into the coastal mountains , five Macoutes are murdered . General Cedras and his family board a plane for Panama . Two days before Aristide is scheduled o return , everybody is freaking out . The mayor of Plaisance requests a Special Forces squad stationed there , but the captain ca n't spare the men . Fearing an outbreak of violence , Barton has requested , three times , a squad of 10th Mountain Infrantrymen from Cap-Haitien to reinforce the caserne , which is beginning to look like Fort Apache , barbed wire everywhere , loops of concertina wire in the front , sandbagged firing positions on the roof , on both sides of the door , at the gate . Command is n't denying the request , it 's ignoring it . In Bas-Limbe , the imaginary colonel empties his pockets to explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them . Barton is " sick and tired of being in the fucking police biz , and I 'm just about ready to let the Haitian soldiers loose and beat the shit out of everybody like they used to do . " The day before Aristide arrives , the good folks at Cap send the caserne ten body bags , which they figure the Special Forces will find a use for . Bandits are reported to be operating all along Route 100 , from Port-au-Prince to Cap . A FRAPH house is torched in Plaisance . Around midafternoon , pandemonium erupts in the marketplace as the Lavalas radicals chase a middle-aged , middle-class woman into the caserne . " Kill her ! " people scream . " She 's a Macoute , a traitor ; she turned in Lavalas members to the FADH . " The woman is traumatized and mumbles her innocence over and over like a prayer . Her four children are still at home , trapped by a mob . A Special Forces team meeting after dinner gets contentious . The NCOs want guidance but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't beat them up , " says Sergeant Miatke . " We ca n't shoot them . We do n't have the authority to bring them in and lock them up . Their man 's going to be in the palace , so maybe the best thing is to befriend them . But if we rough them up , then they 're going to say let 's fuck the Americans up , but that wo n't work because we 'll just shoot them . There 's no correct answer . " Despite heavy rains , in the early hours of October 15 , 1994 , the first manifestations begin . By morning , the island of Haiti has exhausted itself . The people have spent their bitterness in a spree of gratitude and exultation ; they 're too worn out to do anything but stand in the gaily decorated carnival sheds they 've erected along every roadside and listen to the radio to finally hear that the nightmare is over . Aristide lands at midday , protected by a private security force , addresses the crowds outside the National Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . His return proceeds without incident . We were wrong . There is n't going to be any violence on this day . The egg has returned to the chicken , but the chicken is leashed to the table of American foreign policy . Before the sun is down , there 's a moment that could n't have happened yesterday ; tomorrow it will be almost impossible to re-create . About an hour before twilight , the woman who was accused of being a Macoute asks the Special Forces to help her go into hiding , to take her to a friend 's house far out in the countryside where she can seek refuge . Sergeant Miatke and two of the NCOs agree to take her . I go along , and so does one of the FADH ; so does a precocious kid the camp has sort of adopted . The weight lifts off the woman 's shoulders once we 've passed the city limits and are rumbling through the fragrant countryside down roads we 've never been on before jammed with revelers who , when they see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse . " I 'm not a Macoute , " the woman tries to explain to us ; her husband is a supporter of a former presidential candidate who lost out to Aristide , and that 's why , she says , all the trouble started . In one of the crowds on the road , the FADH soldier recognizes a former comrade , a deserter from the caserne , and talks him into joining us in the Humvee . We 're deep in the jungle , deep into what many people in the United States would call the heart of darkness , and the light 's golden ; the road for miles so dense with ecstasy that we crawl along , barely moving . Suddenly the bravest of the Lavalas horde start climbing aboard , five , six , seven , twelve , twenty , twenty-one , everybody in Haiti is in this Humvee , and we roll along through the forest and fields , dancing and singing  --  a magic , illusory bubble of reconciliation . In Haiti , in perhaps too much of the world , democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested .
