SENTENCED TO DEATH SINCE 1986 , the unrepentant killers idle in hundreds of maximum-security " igloos , " scattered strategically across eight states . The igloos are constructed of reinforced concrete , then smothered under 2 ft. of earth . Their double-padlocked steel doors are blocked by 2 1/2-ton concrete blocks and monitored by Army personnel . <P> When the hour of execution finally arrives , the killers will be transported from their bunkers in airtight , fire-resistant containers . At the death house , they will be loaded onto conveyor belts , stripped by remote-controlled machines , then plunged down a chute into a 2700-degree F inferno . Anything that comes into contact with these untouchables during their final transport  --  wraps , pallets , gloves  --  will be incinerated as well . Thus America will bid an unsentimental farewell to 30,600 tons of chemical weapons . <P> That , at least , is the plan . But in the decade since Congress issued its death warrant , the stockpile has proved more wily a foe than Hannibal Lecter . As technical snafus have caused the deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated cost of incinerating 3.3 million chemical weapons has soared from $1.7 billion to $12 billion . At the same time , the risk of not destroying the stockpile grows exponentially as the weapons decay . <P> Seven years after ground was broken in 1985 to build a prototype incinerator on Johnston Atoll , 750 miles from Hawaii , Congress put the program on hold because of cost and safety concerns . It resumed the incineration program 18 months later , when the independent National Research Council concluded that to pause and explore alternative disposal methods was too risky because the weapons  --  rockets , artillery shells , bombs and land mines  --  are deteriorating . There have been some 2,100 reported incidents of leakage inside the igloos . Last summer at the Anniston Army Depot in Alabama , 60 workers were evacuated and one was hospitalized after the nerve gas sarin leaked from an M-55 rocket . <P> Two weeks ago , the Pentagon released the first detailed information about the size , type and location of the weapons caches in eight states and on Johnston Atoll . Major General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predicted , " This will help minimize misunderstandings , expedite the environmental permitting processes and save money . " But the history of the one operating incinerator is not reassuring . Though the Johnston facility has destroyed 3% of the nation 's stockpile since coming on line in 1990 , the effort has been plagued by mishaps . Conveyor belts , chutes and gates have jammed ; a rocket exploded inside the incinerator ; estimates of the incinerator 's efficiency have been revised downward as the Army discovered that it can destroy only seven M-55 rockets an hour rather than the anticipated 24 . <P> More distressing , toxins have leaked through clogged hoses and faulty filter gaskets on two occasions . After one such incident , the Environmental Protection Agency fined the Army $91,700 for " releasing a nerve agent above allowable levels . " Says Craig Williams of the Chemical Weapons Working Group , a nationwide citizens ' coalition : " To allow all of these incinerators to operate at the same time is a recipe for disaster .
