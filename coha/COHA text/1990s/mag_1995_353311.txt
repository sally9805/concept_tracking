Living through a bomb attack  --  the sudden deafening noise ; the flying glass and masonry ; the bloody , broken bodies and screams of the injured  --  is traumatic enough to throw most adults into profound shock . But if the grownups who survived the Oklahoma City explosion are numb in its aftermath , what could be going through the minds of the blast 's smallest and most vulnerable victims , the children ? <P> Although it is natural to assume that kids would be particularly devastated at seeing their safe world literally fall apart , research suggests that on average , children are no more adversely affected than adults are . That is n't to say there are n't severe emotional consequences . After the initial shock has worn off , children who have survived a shooting , explosion or natural disaster tend to be generally fearful , have trouble sleeping and have difficulty concentrating and carrying on their normal activities . Those who are especially sensitive to stress may suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder , in which the mind keeps replaying the trauma with terrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disaster as a story , often as something that happened to someone else . Many become edgy and almost hyperactive . <P> One important way to restore these children to emotional health , say the experts , is to reassure them that their once stable world , rocked by a sudden calamity , can right itself again . Children too young to express complex feelings verbally will ask for extra attention in other ways  --  by regressing to immature behavior , for example , or temporarily losing skills such as toilet training , or clinging to parents or other caretakers . Older children , say psychologists , should be encouraged to ventilate their thoughts and fears . And for kids of all ages , it 's important to restore a sense of stability by returning as quickly as possible to a predictable routine . For most children , says Dr. Gaston Blom , a psychiatrist at Boston University Medical School , these measures can ease the anxiety of a traumatic event within a few months . <P> For very young children , the healing may be much quicker . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central nervous system is still too undeveloped for memories to become firmly established . But other experts insist that memories are stored and may resurface when children are old enough to verbalize their trauma . In any case , says Dr. Blom , " we can only give them a stable , warm environment and hope that the nervous system by its immaturity will allow them some relief . " <P>  --  By Michael D. Lemonick .
