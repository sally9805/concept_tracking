<p> Do not view executions <p> Regarding the Feb. 9 story , " " Long death watch nearly at end - Mom ready to see kids ' murderer die " : <p> My deep sympathy goes to Linda Kelley , whose two children were murdered by Leo Jenkins . I also feel very strongly that we , in a civilized society , ought to be ashamed of ourselves to watch any execution , even though it is legal to watch the murderers die . <p> Witnessing the monsters die slowly by lethal injection will not bring our loved ones back to life . It is a big tragedy for both sides of families to have to go through . <p> We need to sit down and try to find a common ground how to deal with this horrible situation . <p> It was wrong to watch executions . Let the state of Texas do the job . <p> I do not want to hear later that we are the ones who administer the lethal injection since we are tired of just watching the execution . <p> Deddy Mansyur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Finally someone is standing up for the rights of U.S. citizens . The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo executive committee will limit scholarship eligibility to U.S. citizens . <p> They must stick by their decision . <p> The big issue is that illegals from any country have broken our laws by being here . They should not be given anything , i.e. welfare , food stamps , schooling , etc . They are using our own system to bleed us dry . <p> Our lawmakers are at fault , and if the laws need to be changed to right the situation , then change them . <p> I and many others will be looking at candidates to see if they support the rights of the citizens of this country against the rights of lawbreakers . <p> Joy Cotten , Alvin <p> Re : rodeo scholarship debate <p> Sincerest thanks to the Chronicle Editorial Board for having the courage and wisdom to apologize publicly to members of the Go Tejano Committee , but also to the Hispanic community as well ( Editorial page , Feb. 9 ) . <p> You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because none of the individuals speaking out on this issue have ever worked inside to help our youth find brighter futures . <p> Somehow , they have found that their screaming and yelling gets coverage in the media . <p> Some would argue that they have a First Amendment right to voice their opinions . <p> While this is true , we must also remember that yelling " " fire " in a theater is not protected because of the disruption and danger such an expression creates . <p> The issue remains that while many are working as hard as we can to improve the daily lives of all people who deserve the opportunity to explore the talent within them , a few others are out there creating havoc . They are masters at sound bites and one-liners . But can they spell " " encyclopedia " or " " scholarship " ? <p> I have been a volunteer with the Reata Committee , which has selected the recipients for the Go Tejano Committee for many years . <p> The scholarship program is offered to a nine-county area . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of applicants to this great program . <p> About the question of citizenship : Become one ! There is more than just national pride and rights reserved from this status . <p> There is responsibility of ownership in the affairs and direction of your life that become just as self-evident as the truths . <p> All of us pay taxes here in Texas . Ask how many out-of-state waivers have been granted to students allowing them to pay in-state tuition . All of us pay taxes to the Houston Community College System . Ask how many out-of-district students pay in-district tuition . Addressing these issues can lighten the burden of providing better educational services as we free up resources originally pooled by and for the taxpayer and his/her descendants . It remains an issue of contributing one 's fair share to enjoy the fruits of labor . <p> Let us remember always to pass on the virtues of courage , wisdom , temperance and justice in order to preserve life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . <p> Luciano Salinas Jr. , volunteer , <p> Reata Committee for Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Harris College <p> Re : rodeo scholarship debate <p> We teach our youth that education is the best way out of poverty and the key to success . <p> Legally , no one under the age of 18 can become a U.S. citizen . <p> Beforehand , however , they must attain status as a legal U.S. resident alien for five years . Thus , we have students who graduate at the top of their class and who are in compliance with U.S. laws . <p> Go Tejano Committee members : If we Latinos do not support our own community , who will ? <p> Anna Nunez , Houston <p> Only power for himself <p> In his Feb. 1 column , " " Cohorts in denial about modern slavery , " Clarence Page has brought to light a story that has gone almost unreported in the major media : the slave trade going on among certain African countries . <p> As he receives money from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan 's silence on Libya 's participation in the African slave trade proves that Farrakhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for himself . <p> He is willing to overlook Libya 's crimes against black women and children for more money and power . <p> Thank you for printing this enlightening column . <p> J. Griffin , Seabrook <p> Social norms in Mexico <p> I am outraged at Susan Nenney 's self-righteous " " outrage " tirade about the young runaway who recently gave birth ( Viewpoints , Feb. 6 ) . <p> Nenney , of Planned Parenthood , is ignorant about Mexico - my country of origin - and displays callous disregard for Mexico 's social norms . <p> It appears that she would replace what is a normal " " life script " for Pedro Sotelo and Adela Quintana , and re-route them ( as they already have been ) : Pedro to jail ; the baby possibly to foster care and Adel , to further care as a " " child . " <p> Nenney says that even if something is acceptable and normal in another culture , that " " does n't make it right - in any culture . " <p> That statement is pure arrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her cookie-cutter culture . <p> After discovering Adela was 14 , not 10 , and that her age difference with Pedro is accepted in Mexico , everyone should have gotten out of their lives . <p> Clara Alicia Boggs , Houston <p> Ignorant of the facts <p> Columnist Anthony Lewis accused Steve Forbes of being " " flaky " because he stated that " " much of acid rain is created by nature , not by smokestacks " ( " " Dole a victim in Forbes ' flat tax scheme , " Editorial page , Feb. 3 ) . <p> I suggest that this statement is more revealing of Lewis ' ignorance of the facts rather than a mark against Forbes . <p> When lightning occurs in the atmosphere , nitric acid is formed , which makes rain acidic . In the absence of any manmade pollution , rain would still be acidic because of this . <p> The truth is that both nature and manmade polluntants cause rain to be acidic , and the real debate occurs over how much more acidity is added to acid rain by manmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acid rain causes . <p> David Paul , Sugar Land <p> Consumption tax unjust <p> A national consumption tax would be unjust to prudent Americans who have savings or other forms of net worth , because they have already paid a hefty income tax on wages used to build that net worth . <p> It would be grossly unfair to tax such savings as it is spent . <p> Amy Dietle , Sugar Land
