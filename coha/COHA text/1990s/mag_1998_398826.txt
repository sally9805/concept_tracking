<p> Just as Thomas Hart Benton before him , Michigan artist Robert Barnum took on a mural project and transformed this Renaissance art form into an embodiment of modern American concerns and ideals . <p> Robert Barnum 's mural painting , The Visionary , has energized and enlivened the campus of Ferris State University in Big Rapids , Michigan . Not simply a personal statement , this is a piece of public art that seeks to transform the people who walk past it , inspiring them with a sense of its goals and ideals . In this respect , it relates to the great murals of the Italian Renaissance , which gave visual expression to religious and civic philosophies . But if an artist is to give vital expression to such ideals in the present day , he or she can not simply copy the work of the past . Rather the artist must transform the language so that it speaks in a modern American idiom and represents a world that relates to the one we move through daily . To provide some context for just how Barnum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great American mural painter that came before him Thomas Hart Benton . <p> In 1930 , Benton produced a grandiose , 10-panel cycle of American life entitled America Today . As one of the Regionalists  --  a group of artists taking a hard look at life during the Great Depression  --  Benton constructed this mural around contemporary working-class figures engaged in their daily activities of work and play . Benton loved mural painting ; instead of producing easel paintings for people of wealth and culture , he hoped to bring art back to common people by adorning public spaces . He wanted , in short , to make a true form of popular art . As he once declared , " I want to be as important to Americans as the funny papers are . " <p> While Benton 's murals are huge , they are also an act of compression . Figures from different walks of life , engaged in different and often unrelated activities , are pressed into the same space , so occurrences that in real life would take place out of sight from each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compression , Benton looked back to the art of the Renaissance and employed artistic devices of the period with new meaning . We see this most clearly in Benton 's mural entitled A Social History of the State of Missouri , which he painted in 1935 for the capitol of his home state . The way Benton organized the wall is obviously similar to Michelangelo 's paintings for the Sistine Chapel . Interestingly , however , Benton 's design is not simply a literal copy but a reconception of the Renaissance scheme of organization , expressing a new American meaning . <p> A long band depicting the history of Missouri from frontier times to the present carries the narrative progress of Benton 's mural . At key points , however , the artist inserted large-scale figures that move the work out of the realm of history into Missouri mythology , with such icons as Huckleberry Finn , Jesse James , and Frankie and Johnny . By doing so , the artist reminds us that eventually real life will become history , and history will evolve into mythology . In essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through his depictions of so-called ordinary men and women , he invites us to participate in the process as well . <p> Barnum assumed a similar sensibility for The Visionary , which he created for the atrium of the arts and sciences building of Ferris State University , where he is an associate professor of fine arts . The challenges he faced as he tried to capture the spirit and history of Ferris State can be broken down into two aspects : those that were chiefly physical , and those that involved artistic problems of organization and expression . Of course , the two are interrelated , but certainly one of the impressive things about this picture is that it 's enormous ; it 's a remarkable accomplishment in purely physical terms . <p> Large as it is , the imaginary space created by the mural is even larger . Despite his early dealings with heights , Barnum has confessed that he often felt vertigo working on the piece , looking up or down 20 feet of canvas , which , thanks to the magic of pictorial illusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that every square inch of this painting was carefully planned . Every figure was calculated so that it would add to the rhythm of the whole design , and the forms themselves are built up according to an approach that was common during the Italian Renaissance . Photographs of Barnum at work reveal that he first developed the design in earth tones and white , and then on this solid structure  --  with its clear definition of sculptural shapes  --  laid in the patchwork quilt of color . In most cases , achieving the present richness and solidity of color required four successive coats of paint . What is tricky about this kind of work is that when an artist is actually painting on the canvas , he or she is too close to see what it really looks like . So before applying a single brushstroke , the artist must plan the entire design . <p> Like Benton , Barnum creates an energetic sense of rhythmic movement that sweeps through the composition and connects everything together . Two things are especially striking in Barnum 's work : the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound its way through the whole design , and the way perspective is exaggerated to enhance this effect , so that the push and pull of space itself seems to visually propel us through the composition . <p> Another special feature of Barnum 's work is that he often likes to lead the design back upon itself , resulting in a kind of endless loop . The design of The Visionary takes us through an enormous figure eight , but because of its spatial convolutions , it forms a shape mathematicians know as the Moebius strip . This shape is peculiar in the way it twists : the outside surface becomes the inside surface and vice versa . Translate this paradox of inside and outside into larger metaphors and you have a powerful symbol for the paradoxes of modern life  --  in which past and present and our private and public selves twist and interrelate with each other until it 's hard to tell which way is up . At the same rime , however , we feel a powerful sense of connectedness . <p> The design is shaped like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vertical panel in the center and two horizontal flanking panels , which are on the sides . They tell the story of Ferris State University : what it was in the past and what it is today . In the central panel , the founder of the school , Woodbridge Ferris , holding an open book , dominates the design  --  the Moebius strip I 've mentioned  --  circling through the composition and leading toward the present day , which occupies the foreground of the picture . The story of the past includes a fire that nearly destroyed the school in 1950 and a protest by faculty members carrying placards , with a news photographer snapping pictures . The present includes a girl at a computer terminal , a welder in a full mask with a surveying crew behind him , and a nurse attending a child . In the distance on the left , we see the social background of these activities  --  a middle-class home and the state capitol , the entities that provide the financial support for the university . <p> On either side of this central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between play activities on the right and work activities on the left . Football , hockey , basketball , baseball , and the school band are all crowded together on the same playing field in an incongruous scrimmage on the right . Lecturing , reading , note-taking , running errands , and waiting on tables evoke work activities on the left . <p> I think it speaks well for the university 's administration that the scene includes some of the difficulties of the institution , such as the protesting faculty members and the fire of 1950 , as well as its triumphs . The general story , however , is a hopeful one . It is summed up by a scroll in the foreground that carries the words Woodbridge Ferris wrote in 1906 , stating a wish to create a school that was " thoroughly democratic " and a place " for all people , regardless of race or station . " Unlike the murals of the Italian Renaissance , this work does n't portray only divine , heroic , or idealized figures . More like a Benton mural , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world we actually live in . <p> Viewed in this way , this kind of public art is not an incidental thing , but rather an important tool that makes us feel differently about ourselves . Barnum 's mural accomplishes this partly through its sweeping pattern of color and form . When we stand in front of it we feel that something special is going on  --  and that we 're in a special place . We feel energized and enhanced . In addition , through the way it presents a panorama of the world , filled with figures like ourselves engaged in familiar and unfamiliar activities , it encourages us to reflect on our role in society and the meaning of what we do . Our mundane daily activities take on a new pulse and excitement , as well as a sense of purpose , when we see their relation to life as a whole . In this way , Barnum 's mural carries on the traditional role of Renaissance mural painting but in a thoroughly modern and American idiom . Execution <p> Barnum first made careful drawings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overlapping them until satisfied with the design . He then made a detailed charcoal drawing on each of the three canvases . Painting each canvas separately and in different locations , the artist worked over the top of the drawing with a thin wash of burnt umber oil paint to establish the values and direction of the background action . He developed three or four separate layers of colors using a limited palette of 13 pigments diluted with paint thinner or mineral spirits . Working this way , rather than in a more direct approach , allowed him to model the glazes in a desired direction to enhance the sense of movement in the mural 's composition . <p> For supplies , Barnum used large brushes and a palette that was over two feet wide . He had to hold the palette to keep it near him because he often made strokes that were eight feet long , requiring him to crawl or more horizontally or vertically to complete the passage . Subject Matter <p> Because the architecture at Ferris State is modern and angular  --  not readily compatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mural is figurative . Although most of the figures in the center and righthand panels are imaginary , their gestures , physical features , or postures represent various individuals at Ferris State . For the center-panel figures , Barnum used photographic references to render the university 's founder , Woodbridge Ferris , and the nurse , who was a graduate killed in a car accident . Barnum elongated Ferris ' natural height of six feet to 16 feet to symbolize his high level of accomplishment . For the nurse , the artist decided to enhance her natural beauty and age to how be thought she would look today . The two side panels depict the work and play activities of the university and the individuals who will guide the university into the next century . Design <p> Barnum based the initial design of the triptych on the architecture of the new arts and sciences complex where the mural would hang . Deciding a large , inverted T-shape would be most effective , he imagined a triptych measuring 20 feet tall at the center and 35 feet long at its base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about the university . <p> According to Barnum , the most challenging aspect was to compose the figurative action and background such that they would unite the three panels . In the initial drawing phase , the artist settled Oh a softly undulating S-shape moving from left to right . The center panel would serve as the triptych 's anchor , as well as a vehicle for implying a circular movement created by the gesture and clothing folds of the nine figures depicted . To break up the sense of movement , he designed the central figure of the canvas  --  the university 's founder , Woodbridge Ferris  --  as a large cross shape . Besides setting up an interesting design , depicting Ferris in this format illustrates the artist 's belief that good educators , driven by passion , are similar in some ways to evangelist preachers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : The Visionary as it is installed at the arts and sciences complex at Ferris State University . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Top : One of Barnum 's preliminary drawings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center : Barnum 's sketch depicting work activities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bottom : A computer-generated version of The Visionary 's center panel . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The center panel installed at the university . <p> Left : Barnum surveys his work . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Right : Barnum applies the mural 's underpainting . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Left : " City Building , " a section of America Today , by Thomas Hart Benton , 1930 , diatemper and egg tempera with oil glaze on gessoed linen , 92 x 117 .
