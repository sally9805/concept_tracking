THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN CLOSING failed savings and loans , selling their assets and paying off their depositors forever . It just seems that way to many members of Congress who voted $50 billion for that job in April 1989 and since then have had to pony up more and more . Now the Clinton Administration is asking for an additional $45 billion , making a total of about $200 billion , and swears that will be the last . The figure is $11 billion higher than the White House calculated last month ; Clinton aides insist that the increase reflects only their determination to make sure they do not have to go back to Congress ever again ( though the Congressional Budget Office fears they might still be $5 billion short ) . Congress can blame itself for some extra cost . In 1992 it refused to put up any more money , so the federal cleanup agency for almost a year has been unable to sell off the assets of 83 failed S &Ls; it has taken over . It can only absorb losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
