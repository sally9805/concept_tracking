Sifting through the ashes for a verdict on Yosemite 's ' prescribed burns ' <p> Staffers at Yosemite National Park geared up for throngs of tourists this summer as they prepared to celebrate the park 's centennial . For a week and a half in August , however , Yosemite Valley lay unnaturally empty Severe forest fires , ignited by lightning , had forced officials to close the park fur the first time in history . <p> Only two summers ago , an epidemic of wildfires plagued another precious wilderness area , Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming . Ultimately spreading through 793,000 acres inside the park , the Yellowstone conflagration sparked a national controversy over the Park Service 's view of fire as a vital . primeval force in the cyclic rejuvenation of wilderness ecosystems ( SN : 11/12/88. p.314 ) <p> While almost all national parks share the ultimate goal of restoring fire 's natural role to the greatest extent possible , officials at Yosemite and Yellowstone have developed individualized strategies that reflect vastly different local conditions At Yosemite , managers routinely burn parcels if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future fires , and in part to encourage a more natural mix of forest vegetation . Yellow-stone does not conduct these so-called " prescribed burns . " <p> Fire experts now believe that Yosemite 's August infernos , fought from the beginning , could not have been avoided . But the wildfires alarmed many who have experienced the region 's awesome beauty , once again drawing public attention to fire-management policies . Park officials , while recognizing the serious disruptions caused by the blazes , see the behavior of these wildfires as an unprecedented opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their fire strategy Some are pondering the need to intensify prescribed-burning efforts They are also questioning the feasibility of the pro gram 's long-term goal . <p> " In a way , I think this Yosemite fire is suing to be the first real test of the extent to which the program has really made a difference . " says David J. Parsons , a research biologist at the nearby Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks . This park pair sits along the backbone ill the Sierra Nevada about 50 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous program of lighting intentional fires , with the goal of eventually letting nature 's own fire cycle resume as much control as possible . <p> Prescribed burns represent an attempt to reverse the efforts of previous generations of Californians , who eliminated most natural fires from the Sierra . Between World War I and 1970 , government fire crews actively battled any blazes erupting in these forests . Prior to that , white settlers had smothered fire 's natural role in the Sierran forests by moving in huge herds of sheep for grazing . <p> Before sheep tromped through the Sierra , low-intensity fires swept across much of the middle-elevation forest every decade or two , cleaning out dead wood These frequent burns , usually sparked by lightning or Native Americans , kept the forest open and airy But the sheep grazed away forest grasses and packed down pine needles on the ground . discouraging low-intensity fires by making the ground cover less flammable . Naturalist John Muir , who herded in this region during his youth , later decried the environmentally destructive impact of sheep , calling them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century dead wood and needles have accumulated on the ground while middle-aged trees have risen unimpeded toward the forest canopy the ceiling of leaves and needles formed by older , taller trees . Ecologists fear that these changes have altered vegetation patterns and the mix of tree species , creating a type of forest that did not exist before white settlers arrived . The accumulation of " fuel " has also set the stage for unnaturally severe fires to sweep through . <p> In recent decades , concern over such shifts  --  which threaten many other public lands where fires have long been suppressed  --  has forced a revolution in thinking within the U.S. Park and Forest Services . Those agencies , which once emphasized the destructive potential of forest fires with publicity campaigns featuring such symbols as Smokey the Bear , today recognize that the forest can actually benefit from some burning . Within practical limits , park officials now seek to restore fire to its " rightful " place in the ecosystem . <p> Most of the land in the Sierra parks is high-elevation forest , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree stands . In this area , the pre-1970 suppression efforts had little effect . Managers can thus allow lightning fires to burn under careful supervision there if the fires meet a long list of criteria designed to protect people and property . <p> But managers have less latitude in the middle-elevation forests , where unnaturally high fuel levels make the practice too risky during most times of the year . This is where prescribed burns come into play . <p> Concentrating on small patches at a time , workers light fires to burn the dead wood and needles , and to kill understory trees  --  young and middle-aged trees that do n't reach the canopy Over the years , by igniting one or perhaps two prescribed fires in each targeted area , they hope to reduce the forest fuels to a safe level so that future lightning fires can be allowed to take their natural course in these middle-elevation regions , which make up about 10 percent of the Sierra parks . In short , the intentional fires in those areas represent a means , not an end . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , sparking more than a dozen blazes . Despite intensive firefighting efforts , several of the blazes grew uncontrollably , destroying the community of Foresta near the park boundary , The largest of these , called the A-rock blaze , burned 18,100 acres before fire crews brought it under control on Aug. 21 ; another , called Steamboat , ran through 5,280 acres . Together , they swept through about 2 percent of the park . <p> The fires of 1990 have earned a place in Yosemite history books not only because they scorched a sizable chunk of real estate but also because they burned with a severity that caught many park officials by surprise . " I 've never seen anything that intense , " says research biologist Jan W. Van Wagtendonk , a veteran of 18 years at Yosemite . <p> " This is the first really severe year we 've had in Yosemite in recent history , " adds Stephen Underwood , Yosemite 's fire-management officer . " We have had some severe fires in the past , but nothing with this many acres burned in crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal forces in the forest  --  occur when flames reach into the canopy and torch the leaves or needles on the uppermost branches . Most fire researchers believe such severe fires generally did not occur in the Sierran mixed-conifer forests until white settlers unwittingly altered the ecosystem . Before then , they say , flames stayed close to the ground and moved swiftly , earning the name " caretaker fires " because they cleaned the forest floor and killed small understory firs and cedars . Such low-intensity flames rarely killed the old pines or sequoia forming the canopy . <p> By keeping understory trees generally Short , caretaker fires tend to deny flames a path for climbing from ground to canopy , Theoretically , prescribed burning should work in a similar fashion , preventing crown fires by reducing dead wood on the ground and by killing understory " ladder fuel " trees that have risen dangerously close to the canopy during the last century . <p> That theory has held for all Yosemite fires in previous years . But this summer sprang some surprises , says Van Wagtendonk . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A-rock blaze with gusts of 60 miles per hour , propelling a crown fire through 2,000 acres of forest that had previously burned during prescribed fires . <p> Van Wagtendonk , like many other fire specialists , had expected the prescribed burns to prevent such a blowup . " We had all thought that when the crown fire got to an area that had been prescribed-burned , it would drop to the ground , " he recalls . " I had thought that without the large amounts of surface fuels there , there would not have been enough heat to sustain a crown fire . " <p> " But it did n't care what was on the ground . " <p> Under less extreme wind conditions , the system worked as in the past : Crown fires lost intensity and dropped to the ground when they hit a treated patch of forest . Without Yosemite 's 20-year history of prescribed burns , firefighters would have had even more difficulty controlling the 1990 blazes , Van Wagtendonk says . <p> So what 's the verdict ? Did Yosemite 's burn program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed judgment : " In a sense , yes , in that the fires would have been much more widespread had we not done the burning . But also in a sense , no , because it did not stop the running crown fire . " <p> The lesson he draws is that no strategy can prevent all such extreme events . <p> Fire ecologist Kevin C. Ryan disagrees with the idea that the Yosemite fires signal even a partial failure of the prescribed burning program . Ryan , who works with the Forest Service 's intermountain Fire Laboratory in Missoula , Mont. , stresses that such treatments should not be expected to provide total protection against intense crown fires . The planned fires can only reduce the risk , he says ; a chance always remains that extreme winds will develop and whip wildfires into a frenzy . <p> Stephen J. Pyne , a fire historian at Arizona State University West in Phoenix , maintains that the only way to protect completely against such uncontrollable blazes would be to remove the forest itself . " The reason we have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these wildlands . At some point , you have to accept that you ca n't stop all wildland blazes , " says Pyne , who battled forest fires in Arizona for many years . <p> Because such severe fires occur so rarely , they may seem unimportant . But Pyne warns against dismissing the occasional extremes . These fires usually burn large areas and can exert a profound effect , he says . Pyne contends the Park and Forest Services have yet to adequately address how to handle these infrequent but inevitable events . " That 's an issue that I think no fire agency anywhere in the world has been able to resolve , " he says . <p> But even catastrophic fires may play a natural role in forest development , asserts ecologist Norman Christensen of Duke University in Durham . N.C. He cites new tree-ring studies suggesting that the Sierran mixed-conifer forests occasionally experienced severe crown fires long before anyone began suppressing flames . <p> " People want to look at the 1990 fires and say that they are unnatural . That 's not true . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wilderness , " Christensen says . <p> Whether or not intense burns seared the prehistoric Sierra , Underwood acknowledges that he and other Yosemite officials may have to accept that blazes like this summer 's will recur . But Underwood does n't worry about the threat of too much fire . Rather , he is concerned about its general absence in the park . <p> Over the last two decades , Yosemite 's fire crews have conducted prescribed burns on about 28,000 acres , roughly half of the area needing treatment . During the next decade , Underwood hopes to ignite controlled fires in the remaining portions and reborn some previously treated areas . But keeping up with the forests ' natural fire cycle would require treating at least twice as much acreage each year as is currently feasible , he says . ( Aside from severe financial restraints , parkland burning must be limited to keep from fouling vistas and violating air quality standards . ) So , in spite of the program 's progress , fuels will still accumulate to unnatural levels and the forest fabric will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ecologically , I think these changes from the lack of fire may have a greater impact on the total number of amphibians , reptiles , mammals and plant species than these two fires have had , " Underwood says . <p> Reestablishing natural fuel levels at Sequoia and Kings Canyon poses an even tougher challenge because 100,000 acres there need treatment . So far , workers in these parks have burned about 25,000 acres . <p> If practical and aesthetic limitations make it impossible for managers to burn as large an area as they had planned , t hey will have to settle for a scaled-hack program focusing on burning particular areas  --  such as sequoia groves , which depend on periodic fires to reproduce . <p> But Underwood says his fire-management program is still in its experimental stage and he 's not ready to alter its overall mission until more data come it . " This program has only been in effect 20 years . and we 're learning a lot more about it . " he argues . <p> Larry Bancroft , who helps fashion fire policy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains one of gradually expanding the area where lightning fires are permitted , to include much of the mid-elevation forest . But he adds that he may not live to see that goal achieved . <p> With fuel piling up faster than prescribed burning can remove it , can officials at the Sierra parks ever hope to restore nature 's original fire cycles ? <p> " That is a nice goal to have , but it could well he unrealistic , " says Christensen. who chaired a 1986 committee that reviewed the fire plans for the three parks . <p> Even if controlled burning succeeded in returning fuels to a natural level . several factors would still force fire crews to suppress lightning fires in much of the middle-elevation forest . Flames do not respect property lines ; they can easily spread outside the park to threaten nearby communities or harvestable stands of timber in adjacent national forests . This means that managers must exercise extreme caution if they allow fires to burn near park boundaries . In addition , the enormous number of tourists visiting the Sierra parks during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural blazes . <p> Christensen 's review panel raised another potential problem : too few natural ignitions . In prehistoric times , lightning fires started in lower-elevation scrubland far outside the parks and then spread up into the forests . Native Americans also sparked many blazes to cultivate grasses that attracted game . With firefighters now suppressing those scrubland fires . Christensen concludes that park managers will always have to light prescribed fires to supplement natural ones . <p> " It 's a worthy goal to try to accept as many natural fires as possible . " he says . " But it 's unrealistic to say it 's going to be possible to eventually just turn this area hack over to the fire cycles of nature . I think it 's important for the Park Service to acknowledge that . " <p> Underwood and other fire managers at the Sierra parks find themselves playing an odd role these days : that of fire salesmen . They are trying to convince the public and various authorities that the parks need to burn on occasion . even though fires produce some smoky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors or nearby residents . And if Christensen proves correct , the treatment program will have to continue for as long as these wildland forests exist . The only other way to avert a serious fuel buildup would be to allow selective logging within the park . <p> Underwood remains hopeful that taxpayers will accept more prescribed burning  --  if not for ecological considerations . then for monetary reasons . Tile Sierra parks spend about $30,000 annually on prescribed burning , whereas the federal government poured more than $13 rail lion into fighting this summer 's lightning fires at Yosemite . While it 's now apparent that prescribed burning can not eliminate such severe conflagrations , the treatments can reduce their frequency and make them more controllable when they do occur . Underwood says . <p> Like Yellowstone 's flames two years ago , the wildfires at Yosemite teach that wilderness preservation carries a price tag . Keeping our wildlands means accepting nature 's dictum : Sooner or later , these forests must burn . <p> MAP : Map of Yosemite National Park Shows locations of the three main fires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century-long history .
