P.S. I meant to ask you for some of the authors who keep your wonder percolating.  --  Letter from a medical student <p> AS A DOCTOR WHO WRITES  --  and a writer who doctors  --  I receive my share of unusual scripts , postscripts , and prescriptions . A recent letter from a medical student , for example , set me to thinking about fire . Wearing either of my hats , I have done my share of playing with fire . The fires have often been metaphorical ones , though the conflagration I am thinking about just now was very real when it made its point to me : nothing galvanizes one quite like a fire . The story begins in a Thoreauvian place  --  in a meadow in the North Georgia mountains . Our family recently purchased some land there , in the Blue Ridge Mountain chain . The land consists of the side of a mountain that slopes sharply down to a racing creek , on the other side of which is a meadow . We 'd recently begun to have the meadow cleared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insistently rooted alders . In April of this year I went there alone , in a friend 's truck I 'd borrowed , to haul some wire tomato cages for the garden . I felt very much like a farmer , suitably  --  and newly-dressed in a denim shirt , jeans , a straw hat . As Thoreau wrote in Walden , " ... beware of all enterprises that require new clothes . . . . " I should have been wary . <p> Our meadow is virtually on top of the Blue Ridge Divide : on one side of the Divide all the water runs south to the Chattahoochee River and Atlanta ; on the other , the flow is north to the Tennessee River . On the day I have in mind , at a time when I could have used it , I was to think of all that water . <p> About noon , having spent a few hours digging stumps , I decided to burn one of the piles of brush . We 'd tried it before , some weeks earlier , but the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pile , which was about six feet high and ten feet across . The flames were soon exuberant , leaping twelve to fifteen feet in the air ; any pyromaniacal tendencies I may have had were soon satisfied . But I had n't made allowance for the thatch of the meadow , thick and dry . The fire began spreading in concentric circles , and I was soon in the midst of a fiery problem in geometry . For every foot of radius the circle of fire gobbled , the perimeter seemed to expand by a hundred feet . I made quickly for the creek with my bucket , yelling for help as I did so . Back and forth I went , hauling the buckets like a oneman fire brigade . The neighbor and his wife came to help . But even with three buckets , I could see that we were losing ground-literally . I was soon exhausted and breathless , dizzy with exertion and smoke inhalation . I 'd been precipitously transported to Dante 's Inferno , but with real flames licking around me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and house , the whole mountain-side , the entire Rich Mountain wildlife preserve going up in smoke . I imagined the forest ranger , blinking high in his watchtower , trying to get a fix on the thick smoke billowing upward . And the governor faced with the question of whether to mobilize the National Guard . In short , I was not only afraid , I was scared . <p> I signaled to the neighbors that I was going for help . I hopped in the truck and , like Paul Revere , rode up and down the gravel road beside the meadow , calling for help from the scattered neighbors along Big Creek Road . Then I returned to the fight , an instant member of the Involuntary Firefighters of America . The flames were still leaping , heavy black smoke still rising , the tongues of my neighbors clucking in their mouths . Within a few minutes , ten or twelve neighbors had come , bringing pitchforks , rakes , buckets , and , most important , in sober retrospect , a huge watering can that directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning perimeter of the fire . We got the fire under control within twenty minutes , leaving a broad football-field-sized area of black . We 'd lost some trees and others were scorched , but we knew it could have been much worse . <p> In the afterglow of our triumph , I met some of my neighbors , including Walt . Walt is a mountain man who lives in a cabin without electricity ; he farms and raises bees for a living and owns several hundred acres of woodlands that would have been at risk had my fire spread . Resting on his pitchfork , he looked at me intently , bemused yet kindly , pausing to expectorate and wipe his mouth with his flannel sleeve from time to time as we talked . As he left , he had some words of wisdom for me : " Next time you plan to burn somethin ' , why do n't you let me know first and I 'll come help ya . OK ? " <p> By early summer it was clear that the fire had purified the meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scorched dogwoods spit out new leaves ; around me , the meadow looked Edenic as I tilled up the garden plot . Time and grass can cover up a lot o bad memories . <p> Late last summer I felt noticeably better about my fire after I learned that Thoreau also had lit one he could n't control . In April 1844 , when he was twenty-seven years old , Thoreau and a friend , on a camping trip , made a fire in order to cook some fish they 'd caught . But they set the fire in an old decaying pine stump . The turpentine of the tree , once caught , acted like a petroleum wick : before Thoreau 's fire was out , three hundred acres of woodlands had burned . It was six years before he could bring himself to write about the fire in his journal . <p> These fires were real fires , but real fires in the service of a metaphorical one : the Holy Fire . It was the P.S. on a student 's letter which led me back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be truthful , I first encountered the Holy Fire in the form of one Louis Pullo , the band director at Central High School in Jackson , Mississippi , where I played clarinet . Mr. Pullo was of the old school , intense and demanding , a cellist who played in the pit orchestras of Italy until he came to America and to Mississippi . I believe now that when Pullo shut his eyes on the podium , he hoped  --  he expected-to open them on the New York Philharmonic . He repeatedly urged the music we made , the notes he heard with his ears , in the direction of the celestial music he heard in his head . He hypnotized us . He introduced us to music most high-school bands would never dream of playing : the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky ; Siegfried 's Rhine Journey by Wagner ; the Fifth Symphony of Shostakovich . By the time we graduated , we had more than an inkling of just how much work and talent it takes to play in the New York Philharmonic . <p> One day stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we were rehearsing , only that the music was classical and difficult . The oboe player , who was still learning to master that difficult double-reed instrument , kept making mistakes . Pullo , with increasing frustration , had us do the passage over and over again . Finally , after the botched fifth or sixth attempt , Mr. Pullo got down from the podium , took the oboe gently from the girl 's hands , and flung it like a stiff black snake against the opposite wall , down which it clattered with a scattering of silver keys . The room was deathly quiet as Pullo strode out . The following day he made no mention of the incident , but overnight he 'd bought the girl a new oboe . Pullo expected great things of us musically  --  music was his life-and he taught us , in that one indelible lesson , what it is like to care passionately about something . He had taught us , along with the music , about the seriousness that is joy , the joy that is seriousness . He had anointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoreau 's biographer , quotes from Goethe and illustrates what I mean by the Holy Fire : " ... to want one thing , or a very few things , very much and love them dearly , cling to them , survey them from every angle , become one with them  --  that is what makes the poet , the artist , the human being . " <p> Take another example of metaphorical fire . In the twenties and thirties , in the series of newspaper essays he wrote for the Chicago Sun Times , Don Marquis employed a little cockroach named " archy " through which he made his statements ( archy wrote by hurling himself at the typewriter keys one at a time ; hence , he could n't capitalize ) . In one essay , " The Lesson of the Moth , " archy , speaking with a moth , asks why a moth might be so drawn to a flame that he might injure , even kill himself . The moth replies , <p> preit is better to be a part of beautyfor one instant and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty As archy watches , amazed , the moth then bums himself to a cinder on a cigar lighter . Incredulous , archy insists that he ca n't comprehend such absolute passion : yet , by the end of this short essay , he concludes , <p> pre ... at the same time i wishthere was something i wantedas badly as he wanted to fry himself . Other authors have also employed the moth-drawn-to-a-flame image . Several years ago , in the same Blue Ridge mountains that my meadow fire lit up , the essayist Annie Dillard was reading by candlelight one evening when a transcendent death came to one of the moths drawn to her candle . The moth was ignited and burned quickly , but as it did so , its wings gone to blackness , the tube of its body stood upright in the round pool of wax at the top of the candle . Here 's Dillard telling the story : <p> And then this moth-essence , this spectacular skeleton , began to act as a wick . She kept burning . The wax rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorax to the jagged hole where her head should be , and widened into flame , a saffron-yellow flame that robed to the ground like any immolating monk . That candle had two wicks , two flames of identical height , side by side . The moth 's head was fire . She burned for two hours , until I blew her out . <p> Elsewhere in this book , Holy the Firm , Annie Dillard asks a compelling rhetorical question : " What can any artist set on fire but his world ? " <p> That is something of what I mean by the Holy Fire : a series of passions that are strong and deeply felt , that make us eager to get up in the morning , through which we live and move and have our beings . For it seems to me that what is often missing now , for so many of us , is something to give ourselves to  --  not wonder only , but also its cousin , passion . <p> I 've just looked up the word " passion " in my dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  etymologically , I mean . The word passion springs from Middle English by way of Old French and Late Latin ( Ecclesiastic ) . It means , via this route , suffering ( as , originally , in Christ 's  --  or any martyr 's  --  suffering ) : the kind of sublime and worthy suffering that makes Bach 's St. Matthew 's Passion exactly equivalent to Bach 's passion . <p> As for the student 's question about my literary passions : an admittedly incomplete list includes John Donne ; John Keats ( gentle John , who spent as much of his life studying medicine  --  six years  --  as he did writing poetry ) ; Emily Dickinson ; Anton Chekhov ( whose plays and hundreds of short stories engage me even more because he was also a physician ) ; and William Faulkner ( what a relief it was to find out for myself that this fellow Mississippian is as good as they said he is ) ; William Carlos Williams ; and E. B. White ; and Thoreau . As long as you 're picking , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is part and parcel of all human endeavors , not least of all the enterprises of medicine and science . And in the practice of medicine , certainly , passion can be a two-edged sword : it can sometimes get you in trouble . Allow me an example from my own experience . <p> The encounter began on a broiling and humid summer day in Atlanta , before we learned that all long-distance races should be run very early , before the sun gets too high , the air heavy in the lungs of the runners . At first all we knew about the man ( who was to become our patient ) was that , about 11 . A.M. , five miles into the race , he fell out , slumping heavily to the ground . A human logjam of runners stepped over and around him , swirling chaotically and hindering the paramedics trying to reach him . <p> A few minutes later the paramedics swept their stretcher into the emergency department . The jogger was motionless and sweaty . The eye of memory can be vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut away for the resuscitation . The emergency department team , residents , students , nurses , took over . A tube was passed into his trachea and oxygen hissed into the room . To our dismay , his EKG showed no electrical activity , no rhythm at all , a " flat line . " An intravenous line was started and drugs were administered through it . The first of a series of electrical shocks were delivered to the man 's chest in an attempt to restart some electrical activity in the man 's heart , our only hope . We drew blood to check its pH and oxygen saturation . All the while , a steady rhythm of external cardiac massage was maintained . <p> During the course of our resuscitation efforts , the medical director of the hospital poked his head in the door to see how we were doing . He and I talked together briefly about the dire prognosis as the team continued their efforts to resuscitate the victim . A " flat line " is an agonal event , often completely impossible to reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and , prior to this cataclysmic event , a productive citizen who 'd seemed in a state of exemplary health . His family gathered in the waiting room . <p> We worked for well over an hour . Periodically , a transient cardiac rhythm would assert itself on the monitor , giving us a bit of hope . Finally , finally , a rhythm appeared on the monitor and , with it , a pulse . The team was exhausted but exultant , triumphant in the joy of the moment . The hope expressed by John Donne  --  " death , thou shalt die "  --  seemed entirely possible . I walked alongside the man 's stretcher as he was moved upstairs to the intensive care unit . I talked with the family . <p> Over the next few days my feelings of triumph turned to disappointment , then sorrow : the man did n't wake up . Oh , his heartbeat was strong , and his lungs  --  but his brain had been damaged by lack of oxygen . I checked on him daily during the next three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was transferred to a nursing care facility for supportive care . Three months later I came across his obituary in the newspaper . He never woke up . <p> Ought we to have begun resuscitation on this man ? After all , the decision to do so set off a chain of events that not only did not prevent his death , but his subsequent hospitalization and long-term care brought about a substantial cost to someone : the family , the insurance company , society at large . In retrospect , perhaps we should not have tried to save him . In our defense , I must say that it 's always difficult to assess such questions in the press of the emergency department . And , to be honest , resuscitation is only one of many gray areas in medicine . Decisions in the medical arena must often be based on insufficient evidence ; and they must be made swiftly , in the heat-the clinical passion  --  of the moment . In terms of resuscitation , as in so many other areas of medicine , the question increasingly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , raises the even larger question of whether passion has any place at all in the practice of medicine . <p> No doubt there are physicians who hope for a new medicine , one without passion and its obligate errors : a pure science , dispassionate , wholly objective , based only on facts . I hope such a new medicine never comes  --  I want no part of it-and I do not believe it will . For one thing , even if we could omit passion entirely from the physician 's side of the doctor-patient equation , there would still be passion on the part of the patient . <p> In my own life , passion is one of the most felicitous and steadfast resonances medicine has with writing . Beyond such personal considerations , though , passion seems to me a necessary ingredient for creativity , whatever the passion , whatever the art . Passion is not only the source of burned fingers , the flame that purifies as it immolates ; it is the holy fire at which all of us warm ourselves against the cold we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STONE <p>
