<p> Greeneville , Tenn. - There 's an Andrew Johnson motel here , along with an Andrew Johnson highway , an Andrew Johnson historic site and an Andrew Johnson cemetery . <p> Still , some people have a nagging feeling that the Tennessee roots of Andrew Johnson - the president who followed Abraham Lincoln , in case you need a hint - are not as well remembered as they should be . <p> " You ask the average person what they know and I suspect they 'll say he was the vice president who succeeded Lincoln and got impeached - if they know that much , " said Alvin Gerhardt , a faculty member at nearby Tusculum College . <p> " As far as where he came from or anything else about him , I do n't think most people have a clue . " <p> " It 's usually , ' Andrew who ? ' " lamented Emily Doak , past president of the Andrew Johnson Memorial Association . " Then it 's , ' Oh , yeah , Andrew Jackson . ' " <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may simply be doomed to obscurity . It does n't help that , as a Southerner who once owned slaves but later opposed secession and joined Lincoln 's wartime administration , he was despised by many in his own state . <p> No honors in Nashville <p> Today , in fact , there are state buildings in Nashville named for the two better known Tennesseans who became presidents , Andrew Jackson and James Polk . <p> No building bears Johnson 's name . <p> " I had one state legislator tell me that as far as he was concerned there were only two Tennessee presidents , and that 's all there ever would be , " Gerhardt said . <p> Greeneville , though , remains dutifully loyal to its hometown president , a thoroughly self-made man who spent most of his life in the East Tennessee foothills town . He rose from humble beginnings as an uneducated tailor to become a state and , eventually , national leader . And although he was the only president impeached by Congress - and acquitted by one vote , as locals hasten to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A few years after leaving the White House , he was elected to the U.S. Senate . <p> Johnson 's presence is most tangible in downtown Greeneville , where the National Park Service maintains a small museum , Johnson 's first ramshackle tailor shop and one of his homes . <p> The historic site also includes a starkly elegant national cemetery atop nearby Signal Hill . Johnson , his wife and all five of their children are buried at the summit . <p> Last summer local Johnson boosters succeeded in opening a second , privately funded museum and library , run by Gerhardt at Tusculum College . The museum is in a two-story brick building constructed in 1841 . Johnson , who as a young man liked to debate with students at the college , helped pay for it . <p> Although minuscule by modern presidential library standards , the museum includes a one-room display of Johnson family artifacts , such as his top hat and a 37-star flag that flew over his White House . It also has Johnson 's personal book collection , with brittle volumes ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The memorial association also has commissioned a 7-foot statue of Johnson for placement downtown . And in November , after years of trying , it managed to get a local mountain named for Johnson . Emboldened , the group now wants an Alaskan mountain named for Johnson , reasoning that the Alaska purchase occurred during his administration . <p> This burst of activity was spurred in part by the 1992 death of Johnson 's last local descendant , Margaret Johnson Patterson Bartlett . She gave much of the family 's presidential property to Tusculum College and had encouraged the formation of the memorial association in 1982 . <p> Whether the group 's work will do much to heighten general awareness of Johnson is doubtful . But it helps salve the feeling that Johnson - and by extension his hometown - has never been adequately appreciated . <p> Johnson actually was a North Carolina native whose father died when he was 4 . He never attended school and grew up in poverty as an apprentice tailor . He settled in Greeneville during his teens and opened his own shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his wife , Eliza , a schoolteacher , taught him to write . He entered local politics as a Greeneville alderman at age 21 and was elected mayor four years later . <p> That launched him to regional and statewide prominence . He served five terms in the U.S. House before being elected Tennessee governor in 1853 and a U.S. senator in 1857 . <p> In Congress he championed a homestead act granting land to settlers , and as governor he established a public education tax in Tennessee . Johnson was known as a friend of the working class and a fiery orator who also could be hardheaded and tactless . <p> " He was a poor man and a plain person , " said Gerhardt . " He was for the working-class man because that 's what he was . " <p> As the Civil War loomed , East Tennessee was among the pockets of the South loyal to the Union . In late 1860 Johnson was the only Southern senator to renounce secession and stay in the Senate - a stand that led to death threats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two years later Lincoln made Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee . In 1864 he chose Johnson as his running mate , hoping a Southerner would aid his plan to re-unite the nation . <p> Fight over Reconstruction <p> Johnson 's stint as vice president got off to a rocky start when he showed up drunk at the inauguration - a faux pas some historians dismiss as the result of medicinal use . <p> In any event , Johnson ascended to the presidency after Lincoln 's assassination in April 1865 . His tenure quickly devolved into a long power struggle with hard-line Republicans over Reconstruction policies . <p> As a Park Service pamphlet summarizes it , Johnson " wanted to readmit the Southern states into the Union much as they were before the war , minus slavery . " <p> That was considered far too lenient by many in Congress , who favored harsher policies and more aggressive federal involvement in such matters as black voting rights . After a series of clashes in which Johnson confirmed his reputation for stubbornness and iron will , he finally was impeached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary legal issue was a law Congress had passed that required legislative approval before a president could remove an appointee . Johnson considered the law a challenge to the president 's constitutional power and threw down the gauntlet by firing a Cabinet member who opposed him . <p> The U.S. House impeached Johnson and a theatrical three-month trial in the Senate followed . Johnson was acquitted by a single vote , but the imbroglio left him politically impotent . He was not nominated for another term and did not even attend the inauguration of Grant , his successor . <p> Johnson returned to Greeneville but soon was back in politics . After failing in two races he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1874 , defeating three former Confederate generals . <p> " He always said that was the most important election he ever had , " said Gerhardt . <p> Johnson died of a stroke in July 1875 , at age 66 . His monument at the Park Service cemetery includes this inscription : " His faith in the people never wavered . " Just above it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long light of history does n't exactly shine bright on his presidency , it generally is kind to Johnson . Despite his controversial Reconstruction views , he is credited with upholding the constitutional power of the presidency when it might have been overwhelmed . <p> On the other hand , he was unable to fashion compromise or consensus when it was most needed . <p> The Park Service museum narrative concludes simply : " Andrew Johnson was a victim of his times . His role as guardian of the Constitution has come to be recognized . " <p> Even if , it might be added , his Tennessee roots have not .
