For nearly his entire life , Dervis Audaja , 54 , lived on the same block in the Kosovo city of Pec , developing close friendships with his neighbors , a mix of ethnic Albanians and Serbs . Now all that is gone forever . Early last week Serb paramilitary units drove into his neighborhood , went to the door of every Albanian home and gave the residents 10 minutes to pack their belongings and go to the Korza , the city 's main square . From there most of the crowd of 15,000 were herded into the local sports stadium , where they spent the night in silent fear , half expecting to be mowed down in a mass execution or placed in the way of NATO bombs . <P> The next morning , the Serb police told the Albanians they could go home safely . But by then most of their houses were in flames . Audaja 's home was already ashes ; still , he was determined to stay in Pec . He moved in with relatives next door and asked his Serb neighbors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever done in 50 years that would make you burn my house ? ' They told me it was outsiders . " But by Tuesday , more Albanian homes were burning , and Serb soldiers lined the hills surrounding the neighborhood . Audaja , his trust shattered and his possessions gone , put his paralyzed daughter into a wheelchair and began walking away from Pec . He pushed his daughter for 13 hours before a truck stopped to offer them a ride . " In a place where your neighbors burn your houses , there can be no survival , " he said last week , fighting back tears as he sat in the corner of a factory in Rozaje , Montenegro , where some 50,000 displaced Kosovars passed through last week . His daughter was propped nearby , in clothes covered in dirt and soot , with no food and little hope . <P> For the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians like Audaja who desperately fled their homes last week  --  traversing miles of winding mountain roads afoot or on tractors or atop mules  --  the world seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the U.N. , more than 300,000 refugees had crossed into neighboring Albania , Macedonia and Montenegro since the bombing campaign began on March 24 . On Saturday , NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said at least 200,000 to 300,000 more Kosovars were heading for the border . At the Montenegro boundary , one column of refugees awaiting entry extended in an unbroken line of misery for 20 miles . Late last week , fearing internal instability , Macedonia closed its borders , with thousands of Kosovars still waiting to get in . <P> What the refugees left behind was a Serb spasm of looting , terror and executions ; what they encountered on the other side of the frontier was a teeming mess of poverty , hunger and disease . In Rozaje refugees drifted through the streets , hungry and shell-shocked ; some would come across small obstacles and simply stop and weep . Doctors scrambled to prevent the crowding and dismal sanitation from causing a tuberculosis epidemic , but their efforts seemed of little use . " People do n't even have spoons , so everyone eats from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TB . It is an epidemiological bomb , " said a local doctor . Added another : " This is hell . "
