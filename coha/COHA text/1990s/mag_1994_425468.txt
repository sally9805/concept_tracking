Easy to design and inexpensive to install , a garden pool can enhance the beauty and mystique of any yard . <p> Complete with fountain or water a garden pool heightens the allure of any garden setting , adding shimmering reflections and flashes of light , glistening movements , and sounds of nature . Whether moving or still , water is always a focal point in the garden . Here , you can derive hours of pleasure while contemplating the reflections of blooming water lilies or listening to the splash of a nearby fountain . In a backyard or garden of any size , well-designed water features can turn an ordinary yard into an attractive place to relax and enjoy the outdoors . <p> It 's not difficult to incorporate a water feature in your garden landscape  --  you can do it yourself or have one designed by a landscape architect or designer and installed by a landscape contractor . Considering how much a pool or fountain adds to your outdoor environment , me cost is relatively low , especially if you do your own installation . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aquatic nurseries , and hardware stores . A number of specialty mail-order supply houses provide plants , fish , fertilizer , and other supplies for the water gardener . <p> There are two basic styles of pool designs : formal and informal . A formal pool has a symmetrical or geometric shape , such as a circle , square , rectangle , or oval . It looks man-made  --  but just as lovely  --  because such uniform shapes often are n't found in nature . An informal pool is shaped irregularly , mimicking nature 's own designs . The most formal kind of pool is one raised and surrounded with brick or stone walls . If mortar or cement is required , the installation of a raised pool can be a major undertaking that will probably require a builder or landscape contractor . A sunken pool also may have a formal appearance if it is symmetrical and surrounded by a border of paving , walkways , and orderly plantings . <p> As a rule , gardeners should choose one style or the other but not try to combine both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or terrace with clean symmetrical lines ; it looks appropriate in front of a garden wall . Informal pools are better for natural-looking planted landscapes and for lawns with wooded backdrops . <p> When deciding where to place your pool and what size it should be , it helps to visualize the finished pool . Visually , the ideal place for a pool is close ' enough to the house so that you can view the water and wildlife from a window . A clear vista of the garden pool from the living room , dining room , or kitchen allows you to enjoy the seasonal changes of trees , flowers , and sky reflected on the surface of the pond even when you have n't time to sit outdoors . And if hot , cold , or rainy weather keeps you inside , the pool can be viewed from indoors . <p> Map out the pool with a garden hose or rope , changing its situation , size , or shape until you are pleased with the effect . Stand back or even look out from a nearby window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like . When you 've made a decision , observe how much sunlight the area gets every day . ( Most water lilies need a minimum of six hours of daily sunlight . ) Then draw a plan , to scale , on graph paper . This preparation is especially important for installing a walkway , benches , or other elements after completing the pool . The plan will show whether you have allowed enough space for the surrounding features . <p> Before beginning to dig , be sure the site is suitable for a garden pool . When selecting a site , take into account the soil type , drainage , amount of sunlight , and access to water and electricity . <p> Good grading is essential for drainage . Refrain from placing a pool where runoff from the surrounding landscape will drain into it , especially if you 're using fertilizers and pesticides in the garden nearby . When placing the pool in a low-lying area ( where it looks most natural ) , be sure to include a diversion course for the surface water to go around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself should be well drained . Although it might seem natural to have a pool in a swampy area , this is actually the worst place . Boggy , wet soil can heave the bottom of an artificial pool , cracking or breaking it . During a heavy rain , water that has drained down to the pool area will lift up the liner . Any flooding will cause leaves and soil to sluice over the edge of the pool , adding silt and decaying matter to the fresh water in the pond . If your soil is very sandy or crumbly , you also will have problems . To keep the soil from caving in , you must design a pool with gently sloping sides or use flat stones as retaining walls . <p> If you have doubts about your soil , dig a hole about 24 inches deep before making extensive plans . Plan to line the excavation  --  walls and bottom  --  with several inches of sand if the soil contains many large rocks or pebbles . This will level it out and prevent puncturing the liner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best when they receive 10-12 hours of bright sunlight daily . Six hours of direct sunlight a day is the minimum for most water lilies , though a few varieties bloom with only four hours . Place your pond in full sun if you want to grow water lilies or lotus ; if not , a shadier spot is usually fine , although shade will limit your choice of other aquatics . It 's generally best to choose a location far from overhanging tree limbs . Decaying leaves on the pond 's bottom can kill fish and plant life , because they rob the water of oxygen and make the water too acidic . Fallen leaves have to be cleared frequently during autumn . When they sink to the bottom of the pool , they can clog pumps and filters . <p> In siting a garden pool , you also need to consider how to add electricity and water . Fountains and waterfalls obtain their water supply from an electrical pump that sucks up and recirculates pond water . A recirculating pump operates on normal household current , and you Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easiest to use an electrical outlet installed on the side of the house or one accessible through a garage or basement window . For aesthetics ' sake , either bury the outdoor electric cable or cover it with stones . A long cable buried inside a conduit can reach a pump some distance from your house . <p> A hose can fill any size pool ; no permanent water supply is needed . You will need a hose not only for the initial filling but also for topping the water as it evaporates . <p> In summer , evaporation can occur quite rapidly . If the pool can be filled easily and conveniently from an outdoor faucet , your job will be easier . Otherwise , you may want to install underground pipes and a spigot near the pool . <p> Both formal and informal pools are edged best with rocks or paving to keep the liner in place and camouflage the edges . Keep in mind the style of your pool when choosing materials for the border , called coping . Edgings suitable for naturalistic settings include large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved sitting areas might include crazy paving ( irregularly cut paving that fits in a random pattern ) , pebbles set in concrete , or square paving slabs . For the best effect , choose gray , brown , tan , or black stones . <p> Water is generally clearer in a deep pond than in a shallow one . A shallow , saucer-shaped pool is likely to become clouded with excess algae more quickly than a deep , steep-sided pool that holds more water . In a small pool , there is very little movement of water , so algae spread rapidly once they begin to grow . In addition , the water heats up more quickly in a shallow pool , and algae flourish in warm , sunlit water . Submerged plants , floating plants , and fish are usually most successful in a large volume of water . <p> A pool should never be less than 15 inches deep ; 18 inches is preferable . For a 40-square-foot pool ( 8 feet by 5 feet ) , the recommended depth is 18-24 inches . Any pool larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . <p> Flexible PVC ( polyvinyl chloride ) is the material most often recommended for lined pools . It is commonly available in several thicknesses . A gray 20 mm single-ply is a good , durable choice , as is a 32 mm double-ply that is green on one side and black on the reverse , and a black 30 mm double-ply . PVC is also available in a 16 mm thickness , the minimum thickness for easy , long-lasting construction . <p> Buy the lining material from a garden center or water-gardening supply house to ensure it is fish-grade PVC  --  ask if you are unsure . Other kinds of PVC may be unsuitable . PVC designed for swimming pool coverings contains chemicals that retard algae growth ; however , these chemicals also may kill other kinds of plants . <p> If you need PVC in large or unusual sizes , you can splice the sheets yourself or order them from the manufacturer . If you decide to seal it yourself , use a glue specified for flexible PVC . The PVC glue in most hardware stores is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will burn a hole through the flexible liner . <p> The main drawback to PVC is that it deteriorates rapidly if exposed continuously to ultraviolet light ( sunlight ) . However , if you keep your pool well filled ( which it should be for the sake of plants and fish ) , the water will protect the edges and the liner will last a long time . The life of 20 mm PVC is about 10 years ; the 32 mm variety will last longer . Both will last even longer if protected from direct sunlight . <p> Butyl rubber , recommended in many British gardening books , became available in this country only recently and may be difficult to find in some areas . This black rubbery material is 30 mm thick and does n't degrade in sunlight . A butyl rubber liner should last 40 years or more , but it is about twice as expensive as PVC and more difficult to repair . Installation procedures are the same for any type of flexible liner . <p> Installing a Flexible Liner <p> Before digging , outline the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adjusting it until it looks correct . <p> Use a spirit level resting on a long straight board to check that the edge of the pool is level along the entire perimeter . <p> Once the excavation is level and lined with damp sand . spread the liner . making neat folds at corners or curves . <p> Slowly fill the pool water . casing the place where necessary . <p> Conceal the edges of the liner beneath rocks or masonry to give the pool a finished appearance . Cut off excess liner and save for patches . <p> Pool Installation Tools <p> Before beginning to dig , be sure you have all the tools you 'll need . The following checklist indicates every item to have at hand .
