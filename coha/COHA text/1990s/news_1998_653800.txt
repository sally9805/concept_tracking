<p> When Robert Louis-Dreyfus was tapped five years ago to run Adidas A. G. , he was taking over the weakest franchise in the global sporting goods league . <p> For years , Adidas was synonymous in many parts of the world with sneakers and athletic apparel . But as one more example of a family-run company that stumbled when the founding family died out , Adidas had been badly beaten by agile new competitors like Nike and Reebok . When Mr. Louis-Dreyfus took over in early 1993 , the company had just reported an $82 million loss for 1992 , after eking out an $8 million profit the year earlier . Business in the huge American market , where Adidas had established its three-striped brand as a trendy item a decade earlier , had all but dried up . <p> But that was before Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , a skilled turnaround artist , began his make-over . Now Adidas is sprinting back into contention even as Nike , the industry Goliath , is stumbling . <p> Adidas closed out 1997 with record net income of $255 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $3.6 billion . In the process , it overtook Fila U.S.A. as the No. 3 athletic shoe supplier in the United States and has set its sights on passing Reebok for the No. 2 slot . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus even plunked down $1.4 billion last September to acquire Salomon S. A. , the French sporting goods giant best known in the United States for Taylor Made golf clubs and Salomon skis . Adidas-Salomon , as the merged company is called , is the world 's second-largest sporting goods group , behind only Nike itself , which has been struggling with bloated inventory and faltering demand not only in the United States but also in Asia . <p> " We 're going in the right direction now , " Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said in an interview here , not far from Adidas 's headquarters in the German town of Herzogenaurach . <p> The reversal of fortunes was evident this week . On Wednesday , Nike announced disappointing third-quarter earnings , though its stock rose $1.625 , to $46.50 , because the results were not as bad as had been forecast . Adidas stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or about $175 ; it finished Wednesday at 310 marks . <p> Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has turned things around in several ways . He poured large sums into creating a cooler image for Adidas with young people tired of Nike 's in-your-face style . To challenge Nike 's design flamboyance , Adidas took a contrary stance with its " feet you wear " concept , maintaining that built-up sneakers can be unstable . And while holding on to its strength in soccer , Adidas gained ground in more popular sports in the United States by signing up big-name athletes like Kobe Bryant of basketball 's Los Angeles Lakers and Keyshawn Johnson of football 's New York Jets in sponsorship deals . <p> Nike , which is planning a counterattack on Adidas 's home turf , says it is not too worried . Stefano Caroti , who took over last year as Nike 's general manager for Central Europe , accuses Adidas of building its recent success by using Nike 's winning formulas . <p> " They 're copying us , from our ads to our products , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials , they 're ours . " <p> True , the 51-year-old Mr. Louis-Dreyfus still has a long way to go just to catch Nike 's shadow . Nike may have its problems , but it continues to control 47 percent of American sneaker sales , compared with 15 percent for Reebok and just 6 percent for Adidas . <p> Yet what Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has already accomplished has won him high marks on both sides of the Atlantic . " It is a great company , and Robert is a fabulous manager , " said Faye Landes , senior footwear analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York . ( The securities firm has no connection with Salomon S. A. ) <p> Investors clearly agree . After Mr. Louis-Dreyfus took Adidas public in 1996 , selling 40 percent of its equity on the Frankfurt exchange , the initial price was 68 marks , a fraction of what it trades for now . Once he assimilates the Salomon purchase , Mr. Louis-Dreyfus plans to sell Adidas shares directly on Wall Street or as American depository shares , perhaps as early as next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style as well as substance for Adidas . A Frenchman in a company with deep German roots , he lives in Switzerland and has assembled an international team to run Adidas , including Christian Tourres , a French executive often described as his alter ego , and an Australian banker , Dean Hawkins , whom he made chief financial officer . " Diversity brings creativity , " he said . <p> Fast talking and cigar smoking , he is an avid skier and soccer fan who once personally bought a French team , Olympique Marseille , to keep it from falling into Nike 's hands ; at work , he eschews collars and ties for sweatshirts and jeans . A graduate of the Harvard Business School , he is equally comfortable in English and his native French . <p> In 1993 , a group of French banks and insurance companies was saddled with Adidas , which the maverick French financier and politician , Bernard Tapie , had acquired in 1990 . Although Adidas , whose founder , Adolf Dassler , is generally considered the father of athletic footwear , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was on the ropes . Mr. Dassler 's son and heir , Horst , died in 1989 at 51 , and the family had sold out to Mr. Tapie . Management was disoriented , and Nike and Reebok were parlaying a lethal combination of glitzy sneakers made cheaply in low-wage countries and promotions with American sports superstars into dominance of a market Adidas once ruled uncontested . <p> Enter Mr. Louis-Dreyfus . <p> In 1988 , he had just finished turning around IMS International , a leading United States pharmaceutical market research company , when he sold it to Dun &; Bradstreet for $1.7 billion and decided to retire . <p> Not a bad idea for the scion of one of France 's wealthiest families , the owners of giant S. A. Louis-Dreyfus &; Compagnie , the traders and real estate magnates . ( The family is large and far-flung ; Julia Louis-Dreyfus , best known as Elaine in the comedy series " Seinfeld , " is a distant relation . ) Yet there was a hitch . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus was only 42 , and when he sought a skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem with retirement , " he said , " is that your friends are working . " <p> So when Charles and Maurice Saatchi asked him to help right their foundering British advertising agency , Mr. Louis-Dreyfus bit . After three years , in which he cut costs , dismissed staff and bolstered profit margins , he achieved his second major turnaround . <p> Now he is five years into his third effort , one that he almost did not get . <p> In 1992 , the British sporting goods group Pentland agreed to buy Adidas from Mr. Tapie , then backed out after due diligence disclosed what it called " fundamental problems . " <p> But French banks behind Mr. Tapie had already installed Gilberte Beaux , a retired French banker , to begin the job of cleaning up Adidas for the next owner . In the United States , she lured hot-shot young executives from Nike to revive sales ; she increased the advertising budget and hired the young British agency , Leagas Delaney , to design an aggressive TV and print campaign . <p> Some experts say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motion by Mrs. Beaux . " A lot of people think that Louis-Dreyfus changed things overnight , " said Eugenio Di Maria , editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence Europe , an industry newsletter that is published in Paris . " But it was more a question of timing  --  he came at the right time , and helped influence some strategic decisions . " <p> Still , he executed masterfully , and the results have been substantial . <p> When Mr. Louis-Dreyfus replaced Mrs. Beaux in 1993 , he looked over Pentland 's study of Adidas , then decided that two crucial problems were easily fixable : Adidas 's ad budget should be inflated substantially , and an overreliance on independent distributors should end . <p> " They had been losing since Horst Dassler 's death , " he said in Munich . " And when you 're on the losing side , it 's difficult to get off . " <p> In the United States , he went on the offensive . To get toeholds in baseball and football , he signed deals with the New York Yankees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 13 percent of Adidas sales , compared with 6 percent when he took over . He says the figure will go even higher . <p> And he has played off Adidas 's rich history . Adolf Dassler made the running shoes Jesse Owens wore at the 1936 Berlin Olympics . So at the 1996 Olympics , Adidas plastered Atlanta with its slogan , " We Knew Then ; We Know Now . . . , " recalling greats like Owens and Emil Zatopek , the Czech long-distance runner and four-time Olympic gold medal winner , who also ran in Adidas shoes . <p> Mr. Louis-Dreyfus says his top priority now is to accelerate growth in the United States by continuing to whittle away at the market shares of Reebok and Fila . His second goal , growing out of the first , is to integrate Salomon to give Adidas economies of scale and a leg up in such trendy sports as in-line skating and snowboarding . <p> " I have a belief , " he said , " that while my generation was into team sports , our sons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual sports . " <p> Many analysts say the key question now is how Nike will react . Mr. Caroti , the Nike general manager for Central Europe , says Nike plans to take on Adidas in Germany with a combination of blanket promotions and high-profile sponsorships . To go after sports that Germans favor , Nike is sponsoring Borussia Dortmund , the German soccer team that was the 1997 Champion 's Cup winner , and Michael Schumacher , the race car driver . <p> Now it 's Adidas 's turn to appear unruffled . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus notes proudly , for example , that he 's no Phil Knight . <p> " He 's the Disney of sports , into the marketing of sports at the entertainment end , " he said dismissively of the Nike chairman . Despite its deal with Kobe Bryant , Adidas , he added , is less centralized than Nike and , with its strong focus on soccer , the world 's No. 1 growth sport , less dependent on American superstars . " We try , " he said , " to be more cosmopolitan. @
