She wears a hooded parka and boots . She has ice skates , tied at the laces , slung over her shoulder . KIMBERLY is 16 , but she 's played by an actress in her 60 's or 70 's . She looks at her watch again . Far upstage , buddy , mid-30 's , runs through the snow like a kid . He spots KIM . ) BUDDY Hey , Kimmy ! How crazy is this ? !

If you do n't upset your mom tonight , I 'll take you to Six Flags Great Adventure . KIMBERLY Dad , you 've been saying that since forever , and we 've never gone , so give it up . ' Cause it 's a lame-ass bribe . ( JEFF appears at the drive-thru window in a Zippy Burger uniform . He 's 16 , not the most popular kid . ) JEFF Hi .

You 're in my belly right now . And sometimes you kick me . Is n't that precious ? Now listen to me , sweetheart , because people are going to tell you awful things about me . You must n't believe them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . People spread vicious lies when their victims are n't around to defend themselves . Remember that when I 'm dead and someone tells you I was a demonic bitch . You stand up and tell them that I was sweet and funny and you have the tapes to prove it . It 's always good to have evidence , sweetheart . That 's why I 'm making you this tape . I wan na make sure you get your info from the horse 's mouth , because I 'm gon na drop dead any second . ( beat ) On the bright side , I just got my Carpal Tunnel operation , so I may be able to use my hands before I die . We 'll see . All those years in Secaucus took their toll . Sixteen years I worked in the Sunshine Cupcake Factory , pumping cream into those Ding-Dong knock-offs . Sixteen years of squeezing that goddam cream gun . That 's one of the reasons we moved away from Secaucus . Not the main reason , but one of them . ( beat ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wish . If I give birth to you and they let me breast-feed , then I can die happily . I did n't get to do that with your sister . She was so bad off when she came out that they took her straight to I.C.U . They say that mother-child bond is so important , and it starts that very first moment . But she was never placed on my chest , and I never cooed over her , and she was never breast-fed , so I think we never had that . The bond thing . ( A door slams . BUDDY and KIMBERLY enter . BUDDY clicks on the kitchen lights and hangs the car keys on a little hook on the wall of the kitchen . KIM sets up to start her homework at the table. ) p. 13 PATTIE Where the hell were you ?

( They look at her as if she 's speaking Greek . ) Instead of take-out . A sit-down dinner . PATTIE Is that a dig ? KIMBERLY No . PATTIE You know I ca n't cook meals in this condition . p. 15 KIMBERLY Dad can do it . After work . He 'll cook something healthy . It 'll be good for the baby . PATTIE Oh .

BUDDY I 'll decide what to cook . Do n't push it , Kim . PATTIE Did I mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly on edge ) No , what neighbor ? PATTIE Relax , Buddy . They 're nice people . You need to work on your social skills . ( to KIMBERLY ) He 's so suspicious about neighbors . BUDDY Yeah , I wonder why ? PATTIE You leave me alone for hours , I 'm gon na talk to people . I need to do something to occupy my time ! For fucksake , Buddy KIMBERLY Do you guys wan na try an experiment ? BUDDY What ? PATTIE Oo , she 's a mad scientist . p. 16 BUDDY What experiment ? For school ? KIMBERLY No , just for fun . I had an idea . ( goes to a cabinet ) BUDDY You 're full of ideas tonight , are n't ya ? ( KIM takes an empty jar from the cabinet and places it in the middle of the table . ) PATTIE ( beat ) I hope you do n't expect me to piss in that . KIMBERLY This family swears too much . PATTIE Says who ? I do n't swear . KIMBERLY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mouth ! KIMBERLY I propose that every time one of us swears , we have to put a nickel in the jar as a punishment . BUDDY Like a challenge . That 's good . I love a challenge . PATTIE Yeah right . You love to run away from a challenge , you mean . ( turns to KIM and chuckles ) Ya hear that ? He loves a challenge .

KIMBERLY Dad ? BUDDY Okay . KIMBERLY All right then . Let 's start now . ( The three of them stare at the jar in silence . After a pause ) BUDDY I do n't understand what we 're supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't swear while you do it . BUDDY Oh . ( KIMBERLY goes back to her homework . ) BUDDY So what neighbor did you meet ? PATTIE Mrs. Gigante . BUDDY How 'd you meet her ? PATTIE I called to her from the window . I said " Howdy , neighbor . What 's your name ? " BUDDY What 'd she say ? PATTIE She said , " Mrs. Gigante . " Whaddaya think she said ? Do you even listen to me ? ( turns to KIM ) Is it me ? Am I the crazy one ? p. 18 KIMBERLY Honestly , it 's a flip of the coin . PATTIE What ? KIMBERLY Nothing . PATTIE Do n't mumble , Kimmy . I may be going deaf . BUDDY Lucky you . PATTIE Mrs. Gigante 's daughter , Bonnie , is in a dance recital on Sunday . BUDDY The blonde girl ? Is n't she in your class , Kim ? PATTIE She takes lessons at the Miss Maxie Studio in town . BUDDY Remember when Kim did ballet ? PATTIE Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat ) The tutu was cute though . Remember the tutu , Kimmy ? KIMBERLY It chafed . PATTIE Mrs. Gigante says if I ever want the baby to take lessons at the Studio , I need to reserve a spot now because Miss Maxie is very popular . KIMBERLY It could be a boy , you know .

PATTIE Put in for me , I do n't have any money . ( BUDDY digs in his pockets and puts seven nickels in the jar . Suddenly PATTIE gets a jolt . She sits up , worried . ) BUDDY What 's the matter ? p. 20 PATTIE The baby kicked again . BUDDY That 's okay . You want the baby to kick . Means it 's active and healthy . It 's a good thing . PATTIE Right . Okay . ( beat ) This one 's gon na be perfect , Bud . I can tell just by people 's reactions to me . Do you remember in the grocery store last week ? People would just look at me and smile . They love to see a pregnant woman . Especially the ladies . Why do you think they were all smiling ? KIMBERLY Because you 're fatter than they are . ( KIMBERLY gets up , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATTIE ( to BUDDY ) They were smiling because they sense there 's something special in here . ( pats her stomach ) Is n't that right , baby ?

KIMBERLY Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word-play games . Palindrome challenges . Spoonerisms . Anagrams are my specialty . KIMBERLY Which one 's an anagram again ? JEFF You scramble all the letters of something to spell out something else . Like the letters in George Washington can be rearranged to spell out Sweet Groaning Hog . KIMBERLY Huh . You figured that out yourself ? JEFF Yes I did . Some come in my monthly newsletter . Like Federal Government can be re-arranged to spell out Large Fervent Demon . KIMBERLY Right .

( draws a diagram ) You inherit an A or a B chromosome from Dad . And an A or a B from Mom . A 's are good , B 's are bad . If you get two A 's that 's great . If you get one A and one B , you 're just a carrier . But if you get two B 's , you 're screwed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFF So if your parents ever have a baby , there 's always a twenty-five percent chance the kid will have it . KIMBERLY Right . JEFF Guess they are n't gon na try that again . KIMBERLY ( beat ) Now can you do it ? ( He does n't remember . ) The anagram of my name . JEFF Oh right . Yeah . But only if you time me .

( to JEFF ) How you doin ' ? p. 28 JEFF Good . DEBRA And so I came here , but you 're not listed in the phone book , so I figured I 'd wait in the library until you came by .

KIMBERLY Jar . PATTIE Shit . KIMBERLY Mom . PATTIE I 'm sorry . I 'm trying . Your Dad put some nickels aside . Pop ' em in . ( KIM tosses a couple nickels in the jar , then looks up at the clock. ) p. 37 KIMBERLY Where do you think he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's probably face down in a bowl of peanuts somewhere . ( KIMBERLY sits down with the cereal bowl and feeds her mother the way one might feed a baby . ) PATTIE I love Don Ho . Your father used to say he was gon na take me to Hawaii to meet him . Of course that never happened . KIMBERLY Maybe he 'll surprise you some day . You never know . PATTIE Yeah you do . Sometimes , Kim , you actually do know . I 'm never seeing Hawaii . ( beat ) Hey , I did that spinning needle on a string trick . It said I 'm having another girl . Exciting , right ? KIMBERLY How 'd you thread a needle ? PATTIE It took an hour and a half , but I did it . ( into the tape recorder ) Persevere in life , baby girl . That 's another good lesson I 'm passing on to you . ( back to KIMBERLY ) I was just telling your sister about Mr. Hicks . Remember that nice old man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dirty magazines in his basement . p. 38 PATTIE Kimberly , do n't say  --  ! ( hits stop on tape-recorder and then rewinds ) Now I have to rewind and record over that . You are not gon na say mean things about Mr. Hicks on my tape . He brought me cabbage ! ( hits record again ) As I was saying Do you remember Mr. Hicks , Kimberly ? KIMBERLY Vaguely . PATTIE Was n't it funny how he called you The Duchess ? KIMBERLY It was n't that funny . PATTIE Yes , he called you The Duchess , and me Hiawatha . He was such a comical little man . ( Sounds of someone sneaking in the front ) KIMBERLY Is that him ? PATTIE He better have his shoes in his hand . ( giggles ) Like in the cartoons , you know ? DEBRA ( sneaks in ) Anyone home ? PATTIE Aw hell . DEBRA Hey , Sista . Ya miss me ? PATTIE Not at all . Go away , Debra . DEBRA Aw come on , you do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very quiet around here . You have to leave . DEBRA Nice place . Except for that wallpaper . Yikes . It 's like you live in a giant thermos . PATTIE I mean it , Deb , you can not stay here . DEBRA Do n't worry , it wo n't be for long . PATTIE That 's what you said the last time , and you stayed for six years . DEBRA I got a few things out front to bring in . PATTIE What things ? DEBRA I 'll keep ' em in the basement with me , relax . PATTIE Buddy 's head is gon na explode . DEBRA Do n't even tell him I 'm here . I 'll be like a mouse . ( goes back out front ) PATTIE How 'd she even find us ? KIMBERLY Who knows ? PATTIE Stay away from her , Kim . Do me that favor . We 'll just pretend she does n't exist , okay ? ( suddenly notices ) Are you wearing lipstick ? KIMBERLY Yeah . PATTIE Why ? p. 40 KIMBERLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what it 'd look like . PATTIE And rouge ? KIMBERLY A little bit . PATTIE I do n't like it . You look like a made-up corpse . ( DEBRA enters with large cans of chemicals . She crosses to the basement . ) PATTIE What are those ? DEBRA They 're just chemicals I need . PATTIE Chemicals ? Why do you need chemicals ? DEBRA Which way 's the basement ? KIMBERLY That way . PATTIE You better not be building a bomb down there . DEBRA ( exiting to basement ) I 'm not building a bomb . PATTIE ( into the tape recorder ) That 's your Aunt Debra . Never loan her money . KIMBERLY ( looks up at the clock again ) Think he 'll be home by midnight ? PATTIE Why , he gon na turn into a pumpkin ? What 's with you ? KIMBERLY ( holds up cereal spoon ) Another bite . p. 41 PATTIE Another bite for the baby girl . ( baby talk ) Da widdle baby eats it up wid a gweat big spoon and poops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ? PATTIE Yes ? KIMBERLY Can we just be normal for a few minutes ? ( beat ) Can you just ask me how school was or something ? PATTIE You 're such a stick-in-the-mud , ya know it ? Criticizing my mothering skills . ( into tape recorder ) That buzz-kill you hear is your sister Kimberly . I ca n't wait for you to come out and tell her to lighten up . ( DEBRA crosses from basement . ) PATTIE Remember Kim had such a sour puss when she was born ? DEBRA I was incarcerated the last time you gave birth . ( exits ) PATTIE Oh that 's right . Well she did . We called her grumpy-face. ( to KIM ) Cute , right ? ( off her reaction ) Hey , I know what 'll cheer you up . You wan na name the baby ? KIMBERLY No , I do n't wan na name the baby . p. 42 PATTIE Aw , come on , it 'll be fun . You have such a good imagination . Remember that Don Ho thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , okay . How about PATTIE Pick something good . KIMBERLY I 'm feeling like she 's a Carmelita ? PATTIE ( pleased ) Oh yes . That 's a pretty name . I 'm gon na have me a Spanish baby . Little Carmelita . My bonita baby . KIMBERLY You like it ? PATTIE Very much . Thank you . ( DEBRA crosses to basement carrying stacks of glue traps . ) PATTIE Hey , Kim just named the baby ! DEBRA Did you show her the shell I got for your birthday , Kimmy ? ( PATTIE looks over to KIM . Silence . ) DEBRA What 'd your mom get ya ? Something lame I 'll bet . ( off PATTIE 's look ) What ? PATTIE I forgot . DEBRA You forgot her birthday ? PATTIE Do n't start with me , Debra ! p. 43 DEBRA You did n't forget . ( heads into basement ) PATTIE I did so ! ( The phone rings . PATTIE and KIM freeze . They look at each other . The phone continues to ring . KIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone ) Hello ? Uh-huh Uh-huh Fine . ( hangs up ) PATTIE ( beat ) Car problems ? ( KIMBERLY starts putting the dishes from the table back into the cabinet . She spends much of the following dialogue quietly clearing the table . ) PATTIE I 'm sorry I forgot , honey . I think the cancer 's spread to my memory cells . KIMBERLY You do n't have cancer . PATTIE Are you a doctor ? KIMBERLY No , Mom , I 'm not a doctor . PATTIE Then do n't tell me what I do or do n't have . ( beat ) I 'm gon na die , Kim . It 's sad , but you need to be prepared . People pass away , you know . Suddenly they 're gone forever . Look at Mr. Hicks . One day he 's bringing me cabbages from his garden , the next day he drops dead . ( to DEBRA , who passes from basement to exit house ) Remember when Mr. Hicks dropped dead , Debra ? p. 44 DEBRA Jesus , Pattie , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mower . PATTIE You 'll miss my mouth when I 'm dead . DEBRA I do n't think so . ( exits ) PATTIE ( to KIMBERLY ) You 'll miss me , too . Because I 'm a fixture in your life . You 'll have to actually remind yourself I 'm gone . That 's how it was when your Nana died . I kept forgetting she was dead . I 'd see a sale at the supermarket and think , " Oh Ma , should get down there for those pork chops . " And then I 'd remember , " Oh yeah , she 's dead . " You get so used to someone being there , it takes your body a long time to adjust . ( KIMBERLY continues to clear the table . ) PATTIE Like when you move a lamp , and you keep going to the same place to turn it on in the dark , even though you moved it across the room weeks ago . Or do you remember when Cinnamon died , and we still kept going to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to it ? That 's how it 's gon na be when I 'm gone . You 'll have to keep reminding yourself that I 'm not here anymore . KIMBERLY Or visa versa . PATTIE ( pause ) You take that back . p. 45 KIMBERLY Sixteen is just an average , Mom . Just because it 's my birthday does n't mean  --  PATTIE ( stops her ) I was not talking about you . I was talking about myself . KIMBERLY As always . PATTIE I 'm the one who 's falling apart , after all . You 're so self-involved . ( DEBRA enters dragging a mailbox . ) PATTIE What is that ? DEBRA It 's a mailbox , Pattie . PATTIE I know it 's a mailbox ! Jesus Christ ! DEBRA You wan na help me with this , Kim ? KIMBERLY Sure . ( KIM goes to mailbox . ) PATTIE You ca n't steal mailboxes . That is a federal offense . ( DEBRA and KIMBERLY cross to basement with the mailbox . ) DEBRA How was school ? KIMBERLY Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we decided to ignore Debra , remember , Kim ? KIMBERLY I lobbied for animal rights . p. 46 PATTIE I 'm sorry I forgot your birthday . DEBRA Did your side win ? KIMBERLY Yeah . We won . ( They 've gone to the basement . ) PATTIE I 'll make your father get a cake ! Kim , you did n't wipe my mouth ! Kim ? ! Fine ! ( wipes her mouth with her bandages ) Come back ! I 'll try to be normal ! Kim ? ! ( pause ) You see how they treat me , Carmelita ? You have the evidence right there . All of it , caught on tape ! ( Lights crossfade to ) p. 47 Act 1 , Scene 6 Scene Six ( BUDDY 's car . He 's driving . KIMBERLY is in the passenger 's seat . JEFF is in the back . ) JEFF Thanks for the ride to school , Mr. Levaco . BUDDY Uh-huh . JEFF You really did n't have to offer . BUDDY You were standing in front of my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimberly a couple more questions before I presented my paper today . BUDDY You should n't stand in people 's driveways like that .

JEFF I got mine two months ago . But my Dad wo n't let me touch the car . Says I 'm accident prone . I think I 'm a pretty good driver , though . Want me to take the wheel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep quiet . JEFF My Dad would drive me to school himself , but he works the night shift . He gets home real late and then sleeps in . KIMBERLY Yeah , my Dad gets in real late too sometimes . Last night it was almost three , was n't it ? JEFF You work the night shift too , Mr. Levaco ? BUDDY No , I do n't . KIMBERLY Musta been hard getting up this morning . BUDDY I managed . JEFF You know , if you rearrange all the letters in Snooze Alarms , you come up with Alas , No More Z 's . BUDDY Huh .

Breathing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIMBERLY ( under her breath ) " Oh sure I can cook dinner . That 's a great idea . " BUDDY What ? KIMBERLY Forget it . BUDDY If you have something to say , Kim  --  KIMBERLY I do n't . Just go faster . You drive like an old man . BUDDY ( to JEFF ) Kim 's upset because I went out for a few beers after work instead of making dinner . KIMBERLY Dad , shut up . BUDDY She thinks I should stay home and smoke pipes and wear sweaters . KIMBERLY That 's not what I think . p. 50 BUDDY Then why are you being all pissy ? KIMBERLY I 'm not . Drop it . BUDDY Do n't worry about what time I get in . I 'm the grown-up , not you . So mind your own business . KIMBERLY I did n't even say anything . BUDDY Yeah , you kinda did actually . Are you showing off for your boyfriend ? KIMBERLY Dad  --  BUDDY Kim  --  ( beat ) Just cut it out . JEFF ( looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BUDDY and KIMBERLY look at him blankly . ) Chevron Station . Its anagram . Oh No , Vast Cretin . BUDDY All right , enough with the Jumbles . JEFF Sorry . Once you start , it 's hard to stop . It 's like heroin . BUDDY Heroin ? JEFF A.K.A. smack , brown , junk , " H. " My older brother 's in re-hab . He crashed my dad 's Moped .

( holds up velvet pouch ) p. 52 KIMBERLY Sure ( KIMBERLY takes the bag and looks at the multi-colored dice inside . ) JEFF They 're for rolling hit point damage and stuff , like if you get attacked by a Hobgoblin . BUDDY That game 's for Devil worshipers . You 're not roping her into that shit . JEFF What ? It 's not for Devil worshipers . BUDDY You go to graveyards and sacrifice cats and whatnot . I 've seen it on the news . It makes kids crazy , and they kill themselves . JEFF You 've got it mixed up with something else , Mr. Levaco . This is just a fantasy role-playing game . BUDDY Try those Pop-O-Matic games instead . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFF You wan na play ? BUDDY She 's not playing . KIMBERLY ( holds up a die ) Look at this dice , Dad . JEFF The singular of dice is die . It 's a die . KIMBERLY Look at this die , Dad . JEFF It 's twelve-sided. p. 53 BUDDY See , it 's like a pentagram or something . KIMBERLY It 's just a die .

BUDDY No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't ask about the family , it was just  --  BUDDY I 'm gon na tell you something , Jeff , because I was a boy and I was sixteen once , and I know what 's going on here . KIMBERLY Dad , cut it out . BUDDY You are not gon na get all chatty with Kim and start feeling her tits . KIMBERLY Oh my god . JEFF Mr. Levaco  --  BUDDY I know how the hormones work . KIMBERLY Shut up . BUDDY I know what this discount burger business is about . JEFF I just wanted a ride to school . BUDDY I knew how to warm up the Dads . I knew how to make conversation and be the nice kid . JEFF That 's not what I 'm doing . BUDDY But I was bright enough to talk about baseball and not some Satanic role-playing game .

And really , I do n't think I should be attending any meetings with you people . DEBRA Oh yeah ? Why 's that ? JEFF Because Mr. Levaco got mad at me this morning , and I do n't even know what I did . But the main thing he said was I should n't know too much about his family , so I think I should just stay away . DEBRA You know what your problem is ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFF Yes . That 's why I take anxiety medication . ( KIMBERLY enters . ) DEBRA You 're late . And I thought I told you to fill the kid in ? KIMBERLY ( surprised to see JEFF ) Oh .

( exits ) p. 59 KIMBERLY You should probably escape while you can . JEFF That 's okay . She 'll just catch me and drag me back here . ( They sit in silence . After an awkward pause ) JEFF I liked your glaucoma paper by the way . It was way better than Bonnie Gigante 's . KIMBERLY You think ? JEFF Yeah , you had that eyeball diagram and everything . It was very thorough . KIMBERLY Thanks . JEFF ( another pause ) So , are you like mad at me ? KIMBERLY No . JEFF About my paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked weird after I read it in class . KIMBERLY No , it was a good paper . JEFF Then how come you ate lunch by yourself ? KIMBERLY I was just reading . JEFF I thought you were mad at me . KIMBERLY I was n't . I just I thought you were done , so p. 60 JEFF Done ? With lunch ? KIMBERLY With the paper . Since you were done writing it , I thought JEFF You thought I would n't have lunch with you ? KIMBERLY I do n't know . JEFF I thought you were mad about the paper , or your Dad or something . KIMBERLY My Dad ? JEFF Or embarrassed . Since he told me not touch you and kiss you and stuff . KIMBERLY Oh , no I was n't  --  I do n't really wan na talk about that . JEFF Because I was thinking that if you wanted me to , I 'd do it anyway . KIMBERLY What ? JEFF I know it 's his job to be protective and everything , but you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . So if you wanted to like be kissed or whatever , then I would do it . ( beat ) As a friend , you know ? ( silence ) Like if you just wanted someone to practice on . ( beat ) But not if you did n't want to , obviously . I 'm just saying . I 'm not afraid of your Dad . I mean I am , but I 'm assuming you would n't tell him , so in that case I would n't be . Afraid of him , I mean . ( KIMBERLY is too overwhelmed to speak . She has a giddy , mortified , thrilled expression on her face. ) p. 61 JEFF Are you mad ? KIMBERLY No . JEFF Because that 's not why I 've been hanging out with you or anything . I was n't even thinking about it until your Dad brought it up . So I do n't know . I guess if you ever want to , just let me know . KIMBERLY Okay . JEFF ( beat ) Okay , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIMBERLY Okay , I 'll let you know . JEFF Okay . KIMBERLY It 's just She 's gon na come back , so JEFF Oh , right . I see . Cool . ( DEBRA re-enters with checks and Xeroxes . ) DEBRA All set . Now listen up , because the plan 's genius . You know what check-washing is ? JEFF This is the sort of thing I think Mr. Levaco was talking about . I really should n't get involved with any kind of check-washing plans . KIMBERLY He does n't wan na do it . DEBRA Just hear me out . It 's the end of month , right ? So everyone 's paying bills , popping ' em in the mail . Gas , cable , whatever . So last night , I unbolted the mailbox outside Krapp 's Liquor Store and dragged it home . p. 62 JEFF You stole a mailbox ? DEBRA Cool , right ? And then Kim and I got these glue traps , you know , for mice KIMBERLY ( to JEFF ) I just helped a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mailbox , you know , like we were fishing , and we pulled up all these envelopes . And guess what was inside most of ' em . JEFF Checks ? DEBRA Exactly . Checks I just Xeroxed on that machine over there with a roll of dimes I stole out of ol ' Stink-Eye 's purse . ( points ) JEFF I 'm getting acid-stomach . DEBRA And in our basement is a solution I made with a recipe I got off the internet . It said I mix this amount of Clorox with a splash of so and so , and when I drop the checks into the solution , guess what 's gon na happen ? JEFF The ink will come off ? DEBRA Right ! Whatever people wrote in will magically disappear , and I 'll have a stack of blank checks . And since I Xeroxed the checks before I washed them JEFF You still have the signatures . p. 63 DEBRA And I 've always been a first-class forger . Did two years in the Georgia Pen thanks to my outstanding forgeries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DEBRA And they 'll look totally believable . KIMBERLY But she wants to make them out to you . JEFF To me ? KIMBERLY I told her you probably did n't wan na do it . JEFF Why would the checks be made out to me ? DEBRA You have a bank account , do n't you ? JEFF Yeah at First National , but there 's only forty bucks in it . DEBRA Right now there 's forty bucks , but how about we fill that puppy up ? KIMBERLY She said we 'd get a cut of the money . DEBRA I give you the new checks tomorrow , you go in with Kimberly . Kim pretends to be your grandmother  --  KIMBERLY I have n't agreed to all this . It 's still hypothetical . DEBRA She says , " This is my grandson and he 's just had a birthday and he 'd like to cash some of his birthday checks . " And they make sure you have an account , which you do , and they hand you all the cash . They wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cake . I take my half of the dough and hop a bus to Miami .

DEBRA Some tube socks then . Whatever he needs , you buy it . He 'll love ya for it . JEFF ( considering it ) He does need a new Moped . DEBRA There ya go , a Moped then ! KIMBERLY I do n't know , Aunt Debra . DEBRA Do n't go backing out on me , Kim . He 's starting to come ' round . And you promised . KIMBERLY I said maybe . DEBRA ( to JEFF ) See what you 're doing ? ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JEFF Well , I 'll do it if she wants me to , but I do n't think she does . KIMBERLY He 's right , I do n't . It 's too much . p. 65 DEBRA It 's not too much ! You owe me this ! Who brought you to that bowling alley all those times ? And the roller rink ? ! I did for you , now you do for me . That 's how life works ! KIMBERLY I know , but  --  DEBRA I 've had it rough , Kim , you know that . You 're gon na begrudge me a bus ticket ? Because that 's all I need . And I 'll be good once I 'm there , I promise . I 'll start a new life . I 'll get a straight job on the beach , selling slushies or something . KIMBERLY You can get a job here and earn a little money , go to Miami later . DEBRA I do n't have time for later ! My whole life has been later ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to get good ? While years go by , and I get fat , and never get to Miami ? That ai n't me , Kimmy . I 'm sorry . KIMBERLY It would n't be years . DEBRA Yes it would ! For me , it would . I get trapped . KIMBERLY You get arrested . It 's not the same thing . DEBRA I do n't wan na wait anymore . I 'm not a kid . I know what life does now . It flies right by ya . And the good things go with it . They do n't stop to land in your lap . You got ta grab the good stuff , otherwise it 's gone . And when it 's gone , it do n't come back , believe me. ( beat ) Come on , Kimmy . Help me out .

Which is n't to say I regret anything . I love Kim , and I 'm happy you 're coming , but when you 're young you imagine doin ' a bunch of different things . Just crazy , unrealistic stuff but And then , when Pattie got pregnant with Kim , it was like " Oh , okay , I guess I do this then . " Which was fine . Made things easier in some ways , you know , to not have any choices I guess . I mean , most guys in the world are just guys who go to work , right ? Guys with kids . So there 's no shame in that . Just being a regular person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel someday . That 's something I 'd like to do . I 'll see these countries on TV and think , " Wow , that 's a weird place . I 'd like to see that in person maybe . " Like Pamplona . That 's in Spain , and the bulls run through the streets chasing everybody , and the guys scramble up the sides of buildings and jump in doorways and some people get gored . It looks fun . I 'd like that . But you need money to see things , so ( pause ) Your mom and I spent a few days on the Jersey Shore once . Right after we got married . Well not right after , but when we saved enough . That was nice . And you know what 's funny ? When we decided to leave Secaucus , I was like , " All right , we 're finally going somewhere . " But then we came to Bogota . Which is n't really the someplace I had in mind but What are ya gon na do ? ( beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in the paper . Some retired gardener won . Like he needed a vacation . ( beat ) See the world , Carmelita . That 's my advice to you . ( beat ) Pattie 's gon na be mad I 'm using her tape recorder , but I got nothin ' else to do . Have n't had a drink in eight days . I promised Kim . See that ? I 'm a good guy . I do n't know what Pattie 's been saying on these things , but I 'm tellin ' you straight . I 'm a good guy .

What I was gon na do ? With the money ? p. 121 BUDDY What money ? KIMBERLY I wanted to walk in and say , " Hey , guess what ? We 're going to the Alamo ! " PATTIE The Alamo ? KIMBERLY Or Pamplona . Or Hawaii . One of those places Dad is always talking about . And I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going right now ! " And you 'd be confused , but I 'd explain it , and you 'd be really happy , and you 'd jump up and start packing . But then Debra and Hicks , and I come home , and then you with the room  --  PATTIE I ca n't understand a word she 's saying . KIMBERLY And I 'm thinking , " Why bother ? " You did a good job pretending for a little while , I guess , but really you gave up a long time ago . PATTIE Gave up what ? KIMBERLY A whole mess of stuff . I ca n't even  --  It 's like you 're just sitting around waiting or something . And I know it 's hard for you , and you have to prepare and cope and whatever , but BUDDY But what ? KIMBERLY I 'm not dead yet ! ( beat ) I 'm not dead . ( Silence . Then PATTIE gets another contraction. ) p. 122 PATTIE Oh-oh-oh-ow-ow-Ow-OW here 's another one ! BUDDY Nobody thinks you 're dead . PATTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How long since the last one ? BUDDY ( looking at watch ) I 'm not sure . Fourteen minutes maybe ? PATTIE It hurts . BUDDY Do the breathing . PATTIE Get my suitcase . And my special pillow . BUDDY Okay . ( BUDDY turns around and catches KIM taking the car keys off the hook . A moment passes between them . They say nothing . She puts the keys in her pocket , and he does n't stop her . PATTIE talks over this exchange , unaware that it 's even happening . ) PATTIE Also my search-a-words . I 'll need something to occupy my time . And the camera . And my bathrobe , I forgot to pack my bathrobe . Plus the lip balm in my purse . Actually , just grab the whole purse . ( turns around ) Are you listening to me ? BUDDY Yeah . Suitcase , pillow , search-a-words , camera PATTIE Bathrobe and purse . p. 123 BUDDY Bathrobe and purse . ( exits into bedroom ) PATTIE Hurry up , Buddy ! ( huffing and puffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That 's all right . Babies come early sometimes . PATTIE Kim came early . Remember ? Almost did me in . ( KIM slips out the front door with her suitcase . ) PATTIE ( the pain subsides ) Oh there it goes . I think it 's fading . ( breathes easier ) You know what Mrs. Gigante said to me this morning ? She said , " Pattie , you oughtta get out and get some sun . You look like a ghost . " Well , I thought , if I spent all the money she spends at that tanning salon , I 'd look all brown and crunchy too . Only I did n't say that . I just said , " There 's been some unseasonable weather as of late . " But maybe that Alamo thing ai n't such a bad idea . It 's awful sunny in Texas , right , Kimmy ? We 'll have to buy the baby a car seat , but that ca n't cost so much . You think that crap-heap of a car can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wipe my brow .

DEBRA Was she here ? ! PATTIE The baby 's coming , Debra ! DEBRA She was supposed to meet me with the money ! PATTIE What money ?

An antelope ? KIMBERLY ( refers to her Safari guide ) That 's a I believe it 's a Bontebok ( reading from the guide ) " Characterized by its long face and horns that twist backwards , this endangered species is difficult to breed in captivity , but seems to do well in a free-roaming environment . " JEFF I wonder if my Dad misses me . KIMBERLY We 've only been gone two hours . p. 126 JEFF Still , I wonder if he does . KIMBERLY ( pulls out tape recorder and presses Record ) Hey Carmelita , this Safari place is unreal . JEFF Your mom 's gon na be pissed you stole that .

Remember ? JEFF Oh yeah . Look at that . ( beat ) Hey , there 's a whole mess of them up there . Up in the branches ? p. 127 KIMBERLY Keep driving . They 're kinda weird looking .

( He honks some more . ) KIMBERLY All right , stop honking . You 're pissing off that hippo . JEFF Screw him . If he had n't stopped in the middle of the road  --  ( honks some more ) KIMBERLY Now it 's coming over here . ( JEFF tries to start the car . ) KIMBERLY You see what you did ? ( Faintly , we hear the sound of the monkey . ) KIMBERLY And there 's that monkey again . ( The sound of the monkey on the roof , only it 's multiplied . ) JEFF Sounds like more than one .

( JEFF tries to restart the car , but to no avail . The swirling animal shapes from the end of Act One return , the projections spinning around them as we hear various animals descending upon them , clawing at the car , roaring , screeching . The sound is overwhelming . It goes on for several beats , until  --  The engine finally turns over . ) JEFF There she goes ! KIMBERLY Go ! Go ! ( And they pull away .
