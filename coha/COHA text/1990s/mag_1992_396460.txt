WANT TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS WITH OPENING DAY TROUT ? GO STRAIGHT FROM THE TACKLE SHOP TO THE SUPERMARKET . EFFECTIVE EGG FLIES AND TROUT EGG IMITATIONS COME IN UNLIKELY FORMS . As best I can calculate , I have missed fishing for trout on opening day once in the past 27 years . If you were obliged  --  say , at gunpoint  --  to read detailed accounts of my annual April Fool 's Day outings , you 'd find a depressing , and perhaps even vaguely familiar , chronicle of high water , fiendish weather , leaky waders , untimely slips , forgotten tackle , too many beans and too few trout . Were it not for tradition , I doubt that many of us would bother to wet a line on opening day . To make matters worse , in some years the winter hangs on so relentlessly that fishing may be fickle for weeks after opening day . Yet if early season conditions are tough for fishermen , think what they must be like for trout . Hatchery fish are shivering in strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wild trout are still likely to be in their couch-potato phase . Streams are almost always high and murky , and it 's harder for trout to see food  --  not that there 's all that much to see . Compared to the rich smorgasbord that awaits trout in May and June , early spring 's platter seems to offer little more than the random minnow or washed-in worm . Mayfly hatches are sporadic and terrestrial insects virtually nonexistent . Those of us determined to catch fish tend to use worms or other bait fished deep or drag spinners through the pools . Some die-hards use weighted flies , usually streamers or big nymphs . All of these tactics work at times , of course  --  some better than others . There 's one enticement , however , that seems to hold a distinct edge in the early spring . It 's the egg and all of its variations . Preserved salmon eggs have been a standby for trout for many years . A single pale-orange salmon egg on a short-shank hook with a split shot pinched on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook trout love " em . But did you ever wonder how a trout could recognize a salmon egg 2,000 miles from the nearest salmon ? The truth is trout everywhere relish the eggs of other trout , and the salmon egg is close enough in appearance to fool them . Using an egg also makes good sense for another reason . Because rainbow trout spawn in the late winter and the early spring , their eggs are available when many other foods are in short supply . Is it any wonder that trout learn to look for them ? Nor are salmon eggs the only trout egg substitute that 's deadly . One nasty spring many years ago , I found the water typically high , cold and discolored . After fishing deep pools with red worms on a light spinning rod for a couple of hours , I had caught only two small hatchery rainbows . Finally , I decided to take a break , build a fire and see if I could pry my frozen fingers from the rod grip . A passing fisherman saw my fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , he had several nice wild or holdover browns and rainbows . " You mean you have n't noticed the hatch ? " he kidded when I asked what he was using . " What hatch ? " I asked , feigning only mild interest . " Why , there 's a terrific hatch of Jolly Green Giant Niblets coming down , " he said . " I 'm just matching it . " As you 've guessed , he was using a single large kernel of yellow corn instead of worms , and he kindly shared some with me . " All I ever use this time of year , " he concluded . I wished him luck and decided to fish the same spots I 'd tried earlier . That evening , two of the trout I had for supper had to be cut into pieces in order to fit into the frying pan . That was my first experience fishing corn , but years passed before it occurred to me why such bait might be so effective . That " hatch " we were fishing really existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were matching rainbow trout eggs . To a trout , a kernel of corn probably looks very much like a trout egg , which also explains why tiny pink or white marshmallows , doughballs and cheese also work well . In the water , they look a lot like salmon or trout eggs . Most fishermen believe that trout are attracted to the smell and taste of these familiar baits , and there 's little doubt that trout sometimes rely at least partly on these senses to feed . Indeed , the addition of fish-attractant scent to Berkley 's soft plastic Power Eggs and doughball Power Baits makes them the bionic equivalent of the salmon egg . These egg imitations in various colors are effective , durable , wo n't spoil and are virtually mess free . Still , if smell and taste are so important , how does that explain the deadly effectiveness of egg flies , those round , brightly colored creations of clipped synthetic yarn designed to imitate salmon eggs ? Egg flies are n't scented , but they work because trout often feed purely by sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fool them by matching the color , size and shape of the natural food they 're chasing . That 's true with mayflies , terrestrials , minnows  --  and eggs . Egg flies  --  also called Glo-bugs and Glo-balls  --  were first developed in the Pacific Northwest for use on steelhead and salmon . They were immediately successful , replacing many of the bright traditional flies that had been previously used . Eastern anglers returning from winter steelheading trips brought leftover egg flies back with them , and some of those fishermen were curious enough to try them in their home waters . They soon learned that they had imported a deadly secret weapon . Several years ago , after hearing rumors about the effectiveness of egg flies for rainbows , browns and brookies , I decided to try them . After all , they fit the egg theory I 'd been toying with . Revelation came on an opening day that could hardly have provided a better test . The temperature never climbed above freezing , and it was so breezy that the windchill was near zero even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my son , Scott , and I had a good supply of highly visible egg flies in colors ranging from pale orange , chartreuse and lavender to creamy white , and I felt confident they would work . We started out with big , weighted stonefly nymphs just for comparison , and as we expected , they were ignored . After fishing a couple of pools that we knew held sizable trout , we each tied on an egg fly . Because they are buoyant , we pinched split shot on the leader to carry them deep . On my first cast , I hooked a smallish trout midway up a pool at the same moment I heard Scott shout . In the pool above , I could see him battling what proved to be a very nice rainbow . Even though our teeth were chattering , we caught both rainbows and browns in nearly every pool and deep run we fished . Finally , the bone-chilling wind drove us to the warmth of the truck . " I think my fingers would shatter if I had to reach into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , but imagine how cold you 'd be if this had been one of our normal , near-fishless opening days , " I reminded him . I 've seldom had to worry about catching trout early in the season since that day . Some sort of egg imitation  --  usually an egg fly ( orange is my favorite color )  --  has invariably worked , even in high , murky water . These little barbed balls of fluff are visible in all but the thickest mud . Yet even with a fly or bait you have confidence in , successful fishing for early-season trout can be improved if you know a few tricks to help you beat the odds when the season opens . One of the best tactics is to save your favorite spots on larger creeks and rivers until later in the season when weather conditions improve and the crowds thin out . Instead , go to the headwaters and smaller tributaries . Not only will you have less competition , you 're also likely to find clearer water . Furthermore , the water in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer than the surface-fed main-stem creeks just a few miles downstream . For the first few weeks of the season , avoiding the crowds is at least as difficult as catching trout . Obviously , if you 're in good shape , walking a few miles into a remote stream or finding a steep gorge will give you a little welcome space . Yet suppose it 's opening weekend and you simply ca n't avoid the crowds . Trout normally keep civilized hours , but this is one time you should be on the stream by dawn . If you sleep late , you 'd better bring your own rock to stand on . An alternative test of patience is to wait until Monday to fish , after the opening weekend crowds are either back at work or nursing hangovers . Of course , those are the same folks who are likely to look askance at an egg fly or a marshmallow . For them , I 'd simply point out that the record brown trout  --  a 38-pound 9-ounce behemoth caught in 1988 by Michael Manley in the Northfork River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and a marshmallow . Do you suppose that brown thought it was a double-yolk rainbow egg ? There are a couple of other things you should know about egg flies and other trout egg imitations . First , keep in mind that as effective as they are in the early spring , they also work at other times . Because rainbows begin spawning as early as February , and browns and brooks spawn in the fall , eggs and egg imitations are a good bet wherever winter fishing is permitted . Also , be sure to check your local regulations regarding eggs , especially synthetic eggs , because their natural or artificial status has been subject to debate , and rules about their use may vary . Just remember that where they 're legal , a natural egg or its imitation will often work when all else fails . Had I been a bit more quick-witted , I might have put that knowledge to good use 20 years ago on a spring trip to Pennsylvania to fish classic limestone streams . The night before we were to fish , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket to get what they needed . Later , while I was n't looking , they emptied the contents of my fly box into a paper bag and refilled each compartment . The next morning as we rigged up and began to tie on our flies , I opened my box in front of our local flyfishing hosts . Separated by color in each compartment , I had the nicest assortment of tiny pink , white and green marshmallows you 'd ever want to see . Instead of being embarrassed , I should have simply said thank you , and used them . <p>
