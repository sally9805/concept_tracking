<p> SIX feet tall and 17 , Peter Nyamora lets himself in the back door of his family 's four-bedroom , Western-suburban style home , and heads straight for the TV . He flips on a program of driving disco music and dancing , then sits down at the dining-room table to fix toast and jam . <p> This is Kenya ? <p> Yes , for a small but sometimes influential segment of society . Peter 's father , Pius , for example , is owner and editor in chief of Society magazine , a monthly whose stories on human rights sometimes test the patience of Kenya 's authoritarian government . <p> Peter , who has just graduated from secondary school , spends much of his time these days helping his father with the magazine . Though he usually goes to bed early , by preference , he nevertheless stayed up all night recently to help with the editing as the publication deadline approached . <p> He 's also formed a band , Ruff Wurk , and writes music for it which he hopes will one day make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a job , get enough food , and pay school fees , Peter is - at least for now - sheltered from such concerns , in the way many Western teenagers are sheltered . <p> " I 'm one person who does n't like to worry about anything , " says Peter . " In fact , nothing bothers me . I just think of going out , think of my friends , think of my girlfriends " - he has three - " think of parties . ' <p> The bubble could burst , if family income takes a nose dive , or hard-nosed music studios turn down his dream of making a record . Yet a weekend at the Nyamora family confirms Peter 's carefree attitude . It also provides glimpses into the making of a young man who is not only very self-confident , but fun to be with , caring about others , and quite serious about some things . <p> The visit also reveals an amazing closeness between parents and children , and between Peter and his 14-year-old sister , Margaret . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punctuated by laughter . <p> It 's 7 p.m. : A choreography of family cooperation is underway . His father , who sometimes cooks , is laying a fire in the fireplace . Peter 's mother , Loyce , who works at a bank , is preparing a fish dinner ( it 's Friday , and the family is Roman Catholic ) . Peter , who also cooks occasionally , and Margaret are setting the table . Later , Peter and his father wash the dishes . <p> Fathers who cook and clean up are not typical in Kenya . And though both parents work , they are careful to spend time with their children . " You have to sit up and talk to each other for the short time we are together , " says Mrs. Nyamora . " Weekends we tend to stay together . " Neither parent consumes alcohol . <p> Peter 's awareness of these parental responsibilities shows in his explanation of why he does n't plan to get married until he 's 35 . <p> " I know when I get married , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't see any other girls . I 'll have to stay at home , help out . ' <p> Now Peter comes into the kitchen . He 's been studying American college catalogs this afternoon and is eager to talk about them with his mother . <p> " I want to go to New Jersey , " he says , lending a hand with the dinner preparations . <p> " Colorado would be best , " his mother replies , with a laugh . They have friends in Colorado . <p> " You want me to go to those farming places ? ' <p> " Why not ? ' <p> " Seriously , mother , I want to go to the East . There 's action there . ' <p> " What kind of action ? " she says , and laughs again . <p> What he really wants is a good music school that will accept a determined Kenyan student with a secondary interest in engineering , but who earned a C average - considered not too bad with Kenya 's strict grading system . Even with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be easy . But college - here or abroad - is the next logical step for Peter , the family agrees . <p> Mr. Nyamora acknowledges that his son is in a cultural and economic minority in Kenya . <p> " I think he 's in a small , elite group , " he says . " We brought these children up in the Western style . They 've been brought up in fairly high-class schools . " And with Peter 's mother and father being from different tribes , the parents speak English , making it the only language the children know well . <p> Peter 's isolation from some of the harsher realities of Kenya show in his description of the poor ( " happier than the rich " ) . And at a time when many Kenyans can seldom afford meat , Peter says : " I hate a meal without meat . " <p> Yet Peter is not completely isolated . " My son is aware of what is going on , " says Mr. Nyamora . " He edits . He 's known the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what we 've written . He 's quite brave . He takes it actually as fun , because he knows , or rather he believes , we are operating within the constitution , that is , the freedom of the press . ' <p> And some of his reggae rap music shows an emerging social consciousness . <p> " Reggae is nothing if you do n't have a message , " says Peter , sitting on his bed - the walls of his room decorated with music stars , including Michael Jackson 's sister , Janet . <p> One of the songs Peter wrote for his band called for Nelson Mandela 's release from prison in South Africa . Now he 's updated the lyrics to call for democratic reforms in that country . Human rights is a theme in his music . But one song simply urges kids to stay in school . <p> And , he says , " Most of our songs are about love . " One of them , about a girl he liked but who did n't like him , begins : " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you smile , girl , baby , I 'm just your friend . " <p> His mother says that Peter " likes to be a leader . " And he is the leader of the band . <p> " We sing whatever Peter writes , because he 's the main life , " says Bobby , a band member . " If he writes reggae , we 'll sing reggae . If he writes pop , we 'll sing pop . " <p> It 's Saturday morning . Bobby and two other friends have stopped by the Nyamora house to discuss the business of the day : Bobby 's birthday party that evening , followed by dancing till dawn at a Nairobi disco . <p> Bobby likes being in the band : " I enjoy being famous , " he says . <p> Famous ? Maybe in the small world of school performances , and where it counts most - among their friends . It 's a long way to the big time from their band rehearsals on borrowed instruments in a church basement . <p> But with typical African optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it big in music - and not just in Kenya . <p> " I know there 's no money you can make out of music in Kenya . So most likely , I want to go to the United States and sing there . Some music of ours is better than the American , " he says . Our raps are just as good , if not better than the ones in America . " What makes Michael Jackson different from people in Africa ? "
