Della did n't hear about the Newly Single meeting until she came home and found grocery bags full of wine and crackers still unpacked on the kitchen table . From the bathroom the shower was whining , and Della sighed and fished out a cracker . If Trish would just tell her about these things . <p> The group met every week at someone 's house ; the members talked about reentering the unmarried world , how suddenly vulnerable they felt , or , more often , how large their lives had become , how wide their possibilities . Trish , who had been renting Della 's extra bedroom since her own divorce began , gave full reenactments the mornings after meetings , and Della hooted . <p> Now , hearing the shower go off , Della printed OLDLY SINGLE on a 3x5 card and taped it to her bedroom door . " Starting your own support group ? " Trish asked when she stepped , still dripping , out of the foggy bathroom . <p> " Just letting you know where I stand . " <p> Trish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe eider . We 're having a topic meeting : New Vistas . " <p> Della made a sour face . She had n't yet mustered the fortitude to tell Trish what was really waiting for her : mixers at the community center with four women for every stammering , pock-faced man ; a medicine cabinet stuffed with vitamin E and eye-wrinkle cream ; friends who talked about women 's solidarity but would cheerfully scissor off your hands for a date . <p> " I wrote a talk . ' Being single is an adventure , ' " Trish said now , padding toward the kitchen . " ' It 's an invitation to embrace life after so many years of death . ' " <p> " You were n't dead , " Della said . <p> " Life with Walter ? Close enough . " <p> " Cancer , " Della murmured . <p> " Seven years . Eight , counting the time we lived together . Why did n't somebody stop me ? " <p> " Because trying to stop you is like trying to stop a locomotive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battering ram . I called him my castle keep . " <p> " That 's Cancer , " Della said . " Sign of stability . Values home and hearth . " <p> " He valued them every day , right down to the penny . It was like being married to an investment portfolio . " <p> The description did n't sound so bad to Della . " How 's your job hunt going ? " she asked . <p> " Companies are n't looking , " Trish said , and shrugged . The alimony she received from Walter was shockingly meager , a fact that Della resented more than Trish did . " I 'll ask the group tonight if anybody 's heard about openings , but you may need to float my rent for a while . " <p> " Better hope something comes along , or we 'll both go under , " said nervous Della , Capricorn , who kept an eye on every dollar . <p> The money was tight , tight , tight . Across the Bay Area real estate values were toppling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stucco shoeboxes that she would have turned down two years before . She was making cold calls again , leaving her business card in mailboxes like a beginner . <p> She had never meant to find herself , at forty-two , still living commission to commission and renting out the extra bedroom , but fortunes kept reversing on her . Her brother back in Terre Haute ' had siphoned off the small inheritance from their parents , and she totaled two cars ; now she had to sell a hundred thousand a year merely to keep up with her insurance premiums . She checked the almanac every morning , hunting for the shift of planets that would let her fortunes finally shine . <p> Taking in Trish had n't helped ; money seemed to evaporate every time the woman came in the door . She wheedled Della to join her at first-run movies and afterwards pulled her to bars that featured expensive , creamy drinks . Della , who had never become friendly with a roomer before , felt herself soften and blur ; she gained five pounds and bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' worth of clothes allowance . " It makes you look like a movie star . It 's exactly what you want , " Trish said , which was true . <p> " That 's not the point , " Della said helplessly . Trish seemed to know nothing about margins , nothing about walls that gave way , water heaters that burst . Sometimes Della thought Trish had n't learned a thing from her divorce . Trish was the sort of woman , Della thought , who would marry again and again , and when she thought of Trish marrying , her throat clamped shut . <p> So when Walter called in early March and told her he wanted to sell his house , she was cool to begin with , even though the efficient , accounting segment of her brain was already clicking away , calculating percentages , possible overage . " I 've been reading the real estate reports . You ca n't be too busy , " he said . <p> " It 's a seller 's market , " she allowed . " Any agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . I do n't want to go around interviewing people . Can you sell my house ? " <p> " Of course , " Della said , insulted and cautioning herself : Careful . " We can work any way you want . " <p> " Quickly , " he said . <p> " Naturally . " <p> " I 've kept things up . Interior and exterior painted every year , " he said . <p> " A selling point . " <p> " The roof  --  " he began , but he broke down then , and hearing the bewilderment in his weeping , Della felt her own tears rise ; for the first time she imagined a real man behind Trish 's gleeful imitations . <p> " I 'll make it as easy for you as I can , " she promised . " I 'll screen out the Looky-Lous . You do n't even need to be home . " <p> " Do what you need to do . I 've got to get out of here . " <p> Della nodded . " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start fresh . " <p> " One thing  --  I do n't want Trish to know . Do n't blast it around , do n't put up a sign . I do n't want her walking back in the door . " <p> " I know how to keep a secret , " Della said . " You get to live your own life now . " <p> He cleared his throat ; Della pictured him getting a grip . " Have you been through a divorce ? " <p> She was tempted to say yes  --  all the nights she 'd stayed up while Trish railed . " I understand loss , " she said . <p> " Let 's get started soon , " Walter said , the relief plain in his voice . <p> Della made it to his neighborhood in under half an hour , and then drove past the house twice , though Walter had given her his address . Without ever intending to , she had come to believe Trish 's dramatic , shuddering descriptions . A prison , Trish called it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel and found a description of her own : exquisite . Notched into a steep hillside , the house gazed down a rocky mile to the ocean , its view unobstructed by so much as a pine tree . Della got out of the car and craned to see the property , joyously taking in the cantilevered deck and the seamless walls of glass that wrapped around the second story , so clean that light seemed to tumble out of them . " Gorgeous , one-of-a-kind home , " she murmured . " Landscaped grounds . " These exquisite too , wide beds of bright flowers hedged with roses , lavish as a catalog . <p> Della beat her fist against her leg for the loveliness of it . She rarely got near properties like this . They were represented by agents with smooth voices who drove Mercedes . Now Della was having trouble catching her breath , the air around her sharp as a new dollar bill . No. telling where this sale would lead her . <p> She turned to look again at the house and saw Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , she recognized from Trish 's description  --  light hair that shot up in cowlicks , lips thin as if he were trying to swallow them . Della smiled and spread her hands to indicate that she admired the property , to indicate her pleasure . He spread his hands back at her , a gesture of giving up . <p> " I made a list , " he said when she hurried up to the flagstone patio . " The refrigerator is new , and I had a heat pump installed . " <p> " There 's a form  --  " Della began , but stopped when Walter handed her a fat accordion file . " That 's every receipt and repair history , " he said , and Della tried to limit the grin she could feel spreading across her mouth . <p> " Not many people are so organized , " she said . <p> " Trish hates this file . She dared me to lose something . She said , ' Forget . Make a mistake . ' Of course , later she pointed out lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of person , " Della said , paging through the receipts . " Any businessperson knows that organization is essential . " <p> " Too bad you ca n't make her see it your way , " he muttered . She laid her hand on his arm and said , " Mr. Darnoff ? Should n't we go inside , while it 's still light ? " <p> " Walter , " he said . " I 'm not old yet . " <p> Which was true , Della thought , following him , but hard to keep in mind . He paused at the door to wipe his feet and straighten his jacket , actions she could tell were as natural as . breath . How had he and careless Trish ever managed ? <p> Then , stepping into the house , she forgot all about Trish . " Custom , " she murmured , brushing her fingers over linen-textured wall covering . <p> " I visited warehouses , " Walter said . " I went to the docks when shipments came in . I thought I was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wine-red ottoman soaked in the afternoon 's gold light , Della nodded . " That 's right . " <p> " Trish would n't even take a bedspread when she left . " <p> " She 's spilled coffee on the one she uses now . Twice . " <p> Walter was silent a moment , and Della was afraid she 'd overstepped . " We replaced things , " he said . <p> Della believed it . Dining room to breakfast room to kitchen she could see no chips , no frayed corners or smudges ; the carpets might have been laid the day before . " Walter , " she said . " This home will sell in an hour . People will fight for it . Are you sure you 're ready to leave ? " <p> " I 'll start again . What 's the option ? " He tipped his head and frowned . " Hard to imagine starting by myself , though . " " Believe me , you wo n't be by yourself for long . " <p> " No ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzling , and she wished he would look up to see it . " Trust me . This is what you 're hiring me to . know . " <p> She stopped in the office on her way home . Working from the lists of comparison properties , she began to calculate asking price , commission : a new car , a workman out to look at her nervous heater . Clothes ! And no more hungry reliance on Trish 's two hundred dollars ; for the first time in her life , Della would be able to live alone . She felt as if new blood were pouring through her , and pulled out the almanac she kept lodged next to her comp books . The answer was right in front of her  --  a conjunction of Mars and Jupiter , with Venus in the fifth house . Positive aspects for business and romance . Della could feel the starry doors above her opening and beckoning her in ; she was so relieved she was near tears , and wondered , not for the first time , how other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She drove home slowly , letting the night air tangle her hair , and worried lightly about how she would keep this new development a secret from Trish . She need n't have fretted  --  when she pulled up to her house she found every light blazing , and music , so loud the harmonies wobbled and bent , surrounding the house like a force field . Trish often put on Motown when she was happy , although not usually so the whole street could hear . <p> The front door was stuck ; Della had to shove it open and wedge herself in , finding that Trish had rolled up the living room carpet into the entry hall and was sweatily dancing with a strange man . He held her tight at the waist and dipped her , letting Trish 's head bobble . They did n't look up , even when Della slammed the door and tried to clear her throat over the music  --  " I Second That Emotion , " one of Trish 's favorites . <p> Della was sure this was n't a Newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified , support-group look . What he had was the stringy build of a runner , and he moved with calculated detachment , occupying his body as if he 'd rented it for the night . His . smile showed half an inch of gumline . Della instinctively crossed her arms and hiked up her shoulders , and watching Trish  --  upright now  --  rest her chin on his shoulder , wondered what bar they 'd been in to get Trish in such a state . " Hey , " she called out when the song ended . " Studio 54 . " <p> Trish smiled . " Do you realize there is no place in this town to dance ? It 's a crime . Should be . " <p> " We took things into our own hands , " the man said , winking at Della as the opening bars of " I Second That Emotion " started again ; Della winced , wondering how many times they 'd played it already . " The neighbors  --  " she shouted . <p> " Do n't worry , " Trish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She staggered , and the man caught her , while Della sidestepped over to the volume knob . She had the impression , as she turned down the music , that shingles were being jarred loose . <p> " Spoilsport , " Trish said , still dancing . She flashed a cheerful face toward Della . The man looked too . <p> " I 'm Pete , " he said . " You must be Della . " <p> " All day long , " she said . " Nighttime , too . " <p> " He works at the bank , " Trish said . " He thinks he can get me a job there . I told him I hate money , and he said in that case he 's sure he can get me a job . " <p> " In my line of work you want to be careful , " Pete said , sliding his arm around Trish 's shoulders . " But I just have a feeling about you . " Trish leaned over and licked the bottom of his chin . Della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become fast friends , " she said , tugging on the armchair 's slipcover to keep from looking at them . <p> " Some things are meant to be , " Pete said . " Written in the stars , like Romeo and Juliet . " <p> " You might want to try looking at how those two ended up . Anyway , take a look at Trish 's accounts . " <p> Trish , thank heaven , laughed . " I have n't ever balanced my checkbook . It drove Walter nuts . He said quality people could account for every penny . Jiminy Christmas , he was dull . I hope I never have to see quality again . " <p> " Hey , " Pete objected . <p> " Cheer up , Romeo . Dull do n't dance , and I found me somebody to dance with today , " Trish said , catching hold of his belt and letting herself rock on her heels while she glanced at Della . " What did you find ? " <p> " Work , " Della said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , OK ? " <p> " We 're just on our way out , " Pete said , pulling Trish upright and leading her to the door . " You can have the place to yourself . " <p> Della felt as if she were watching a car wreck . And although she knew how stupid it was to try to stand in fate 's way , she actually ran after them and pulled Trish 's free hand . " When will you be back ? " she cried . <p> " Now , now , " Pete said , sliding his hand around Della 's waist so that both women were pressed against him . " Do n't you trust me , Della ? " <p> " Of course she does n't , silly , " Trish said . She leaned across Pete to kiss Della on the cheek . " After a week , send out the dogs . " <p> Across the next week , Della hardly had time to think about Trish ; Walter 's house dropped her into a whole new dimension of work . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she spent hours on the phone with other agents ; clients for this sort of property did n't show up at Sunday afternoon open houses . The first couple Della scheduled walked through the house jotting their objections on a legal pad : difficult-to-clean wall surfaces , and the windows , a maintenance nightmare . The second prospect wore a Walkman and put a Coke can on a lacquer-finish end table ; Della did n't even show her the full basement , such a rarity in California . <p> " I thought you said it would sell itself , " Walter said at the end of the week , when they sat together in the breakfast area , surrounded by projection charts and calculators . <p> " A quality home calls for a quality buyer . " <p> " Somebody sees a place , likes it , puts down the money . How long does this have to take ? " <p> " Are you always so impatient ? " Della asked . She worked a giggle into her voice , a teasing flick like a girl 's . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A legacy from my ex-wife , who thought water took too long to boil , " he said . <p> " She still has n't learned that waiting can just make things better , " Della said . " Your home will have an offer before you know it . I have a good feeling . " <p> " Try to sell a house and you get a damn fortuneteller , " he muttered , but Della heard the reluctant warmth enter his voice as he stood . " You want some coffee ? " <p> " That would be nice . " She smiled up at him . On the weekend they planned to go to Tiburon and look at properties on the water , homes that would allow him to make a new start . Walter called her to double-check prices , square footage , tax base . It had been almost five years since a man had contrived reasons to call Della ; when she got out of bed in the mornings she sang . <p> After four days she ran into Trish downtown , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch ; a conference call with two relocation agencies had dragged on for close to an hour , and other agents were making ungentle jokes about tying up the phones . Now Della stood in line , intending to order both roast beef and chicken salad , when she heard a wolf whistle and turned to see Trish waving her over . The woman glowed as if she might throw off sparks . " You have n't been worried , have you ? " she asked . <p> " I figured you were all right , " Della said . <p> " I ca n't tell you how I feel . It 's like climbing up out of a grave . " <p> " You look very happy . " <p> " Happy ? He 's  --  I 've waited a long time to feel like this . " Trish 's mouth quivered and flexed . " You should go out to dinner with us . You 'll like him . He believes in astrology , too . " <p> " My , " Della said . <p> " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wiggles . " <p> " I 'm pretty busy these days , " Della said . " Work is picking up . " <p> " I 'll be home before long , " Trish said . " I 'll need some clean clothes . " <p> Della smiled and nodded and got back in line for the sandwiches she no longer wanted . She did n't need an almanac to foresee this one ; anyone could predict the mood changes , the silent phone , the excruciating slide into doubt and despair . Fretful , preoccupied , when she came back to the office and a message from Walter , she did n't even pick up the phone . He called a half-hour later anyway . No surprise . <p> " Did you get my message ? " he asked . <p> " I was just about to call . " <p> " I got impatient , " he said , and then in a burst , " We 'll be late Saturday . We 're sure to take all day . Why do n't we plan on dinner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to racket around , and she tried to push the blood down from her cheeks . " That 's a good idea , " she said . " It 's practical . " <p> " I hope it 's more than that , " Walter said with an awkward laugh . As soon as she hung up Belinda Rorty , who had the desk across from hers , looked at Della 's expression and said , " Tut , tut . The office phone is not for personal calls . " <p> " He 's a client , " Della snarled . Belinda hooted , and Della added hopelessly , " He is , " though no one was listening . <p> Trish was in her bedroom humming " Baby Love " and folding underwear when Della came home Saturday night . Hearing her , Della was grateful for Walter 's gentlemanly ways ; he had seen her to the door but would n't come in . " Thank you for a lovely day , " he 'd said . Della knew she would have to leave her phone free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the doorjamb . " Hi , stranger . " <p> " Hi , yourself . I was starting to wonder if I should call the police . " Trish grinned , underwear draping both knees . <p> " Client , " Della said , and could n't resist adding , " A good one . " <p> " Better watch yourself . Pete says you 're a damn fine-looking woman . He likes your coat . He wishes more women knew how to dress with a little class . " <p> Della felt herself blushing , which she had n't done all night , even when Walter shyly told her how pretty she looked in the candlelight . " Pisces are flatterers . " <p> " He 's a ruthless flirt , " Trish said , snapping underwear elastic at her . " He hits on the teenage girls at gas stations . " <p> " What do you do ? " <p> " Keep one hand on his arm and the other on the car keys . " <p> Della laughed and sat down to help Trish fold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ? " <p> " Start Monday , " Trish said . " He sent me home to do my laundry . We 're going up to the City later . " <p> " He 's sweeping you off your feet . " <p> " He knows how to show a girl a good time . And I 'm overdue . " <p> Della knew she should keep her mouth shut , but she had her own share of giddiness bubbling up . " I wonder what Walter would think of him , " she murmured , looking at the stained bedspread . <p> " Walter would have a catfit . I 'm tempted to take Pete to the house , just to see the fireworks . " <p> Della refolded a pair she had already finished , smoothing the wrinkles . " Things are lively with you around . " <p> " You know what one of the women said at Newly Single ? She said she knew she 'd make mistakes , but she did n't want to make the same mistakes . " <p> " You 're safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkbook ? " <p> Trish laughed . " Pete brings me chocolates and we go out dancing and when he looks at me my elbows get all wobbly . Della , I 'm not looking for the same husband I just left . " <p> " Good thing . I do n't think Pete is anybody 's idea of a husband . " <p> " You 'd be surprised , " Trish said , looking almost embarrassed for a moment , before she leaned forward and patted Delia 's knee . " Tell me about your good client . " <p> " We looked at waterfront properties , " Della stammered , appalled , but then Pete drove up ; the sound of his car reminded her of gravel spraying from under tires , even though her driveway was concrete . " Your prince is here . " <p> " Can you let him in ? I still have T-shirts to . fold . " <p> So Della opened her door to Pete , who smiled down at her . She had n't remembered him being so tall . " Trish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last door to the left . " <p> " I can wait for her out here , " he said , touching Della 's wrist and walking into the living room . " It 's a nice room . You must have put a lot of thought into it . " <p> " This is how it looked when I moved in . " <p> " That 's not how Trish tells it . Of course , she 's Sagittarius . Likes to make things dramatic . " Della sat on the ottoman , and Pete sat down next to her , so close he breathed into the part of her hair . " You do n't trust drama , do you ? Taurus ? " <p> " That 's right , " Della muttered , edging away , rolling her eyes . " The bull . " <p> " Astrology is more complicated than people realize . It 's more than just birthdays . I 'll tell you something . " Pete patted Della 's knee , then let his hand rest there . " The first thing I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart . I got software  --  I never make a loan until I can see the ascendant , trines , all of it . And you know what ? " <p> " You do n't have one default . " <p> " The best record in the branch , " he said , making slow circles with his hand . <p> " But if you try to tell anybody how you did it , they look at you like you 're a crackpot , " Della said . She was surprised at her bitterness ; she 'd thought she had come to terms with this years ago . " I lost a client once because she heard me mention planetary conjunctions . She went to my realtor and asked him for someone ' mainstream . ' " <p> " What an idiot , " Pete said , shaking his head . " I hope she got a house with a leaky roof .

She wrote us a letter saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an odd motion so he almost encircled her . Della stood up hard , and he said plaintively , " What does it take ? " He put his hand on the back of her leg to implore her , and as Della heard Trish coming down the hall , she backed up to conceal Pete 's wandering hand . Trish smiled when she saw them and said , " I 'm almost ready , " while Della 's thigh grew damp under Pete 's hand . " I hope we can be friends , " he said when Trish moved out the door with her clothes . " We could be good for each other . I have people applying for home loans every day . " He let his fingers crawl higher , making Della 's breath stutter and catch . " I 'm going to be persistent . We understand each other . " <p> " You do n't understand a thing . I 'm not even Taurus . January fourteenth . " <p> " Capricorn . I can see that , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to laugh . Pete did n't know the half of it . Walter called her at exactly ten on Monday , when , she imagined , Pete was hunched at his desk , eyes still unclear from the weekend . " I went to the beach yesterday , for a walk . I tried to imagine living right on the water . Seemed like a good idea , " Walter said . <p> " I was in the office . I 'm glad one of us was out in the sun . " <p> " Everybody was out with a dog . Do you like dogs ? " His voice was cozy and close , and Della , hating herself , felt the urge to pull at her collar , to get away , get air . <p> " I never had one .

She could picture him happily twirling the telephone cord ; imagining it made her shake her head . " Maybe by the end of the week we 'll have an offer . Are you ready to start packing ? " <p> " I thought you knew . " <p> " Come again ? " <p> " I was n't ready before , " he said . " Things have changed .

Romance and life changes . were open at last , a readiness that was determined the minute she came into the world . At her feet the phone rang , and Della nudged it with her toe until the receptionist took the call at the front . <p> " Del-la ! " the receptionist sang out . " It 's Wal-ter ! " <p> " I 'm not he-ere , " Della sang back flatly . <p> " Come on , talk to him . I do n't want to take his calls all day .

She talked to Trish , too , who called to suggest she and Della meet for dinner . " Let me guess , " Trish said twice . " The sun has moved into Jupiter ? " <p> Della refused to be baited . " Why , the sun 's in Pisces now . I would have expected you to know that . " <p> " I should have , " Trish said grimly , and Della heard the fear in her voice . " Is it time to move my things out ? " <p> " Not yet , " Della said . <p> She talked with Walter , too ; he had spent the morning packing boxes of inessentials and was planning on a movie for that night . " Good idea , " she said . " I wo n't be in until late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I have a plan . If I work late now I can keep the weekend free . " Walter pretended to grumble , but Della heard the relief in his voice and knew he had planned another Saturday night , but did n't mean to ask her before Thursday . Della planned to say yes , and to sound happy about it , too . <p> Pete , to her surprise , arrived at her door a few minutes early . They stood on either side of the threshold and grinned . " Come in , " she said . <p> He shook his head . " If I come in I wo n't be able to keep my hands off you . " <p> " Then let 's go , " she said , excitement running through her so quick and light that her hands shook as she closed the door ; she was frantic , wild as a teenager to be touched . " You know this is a very bad idea , " she said as he started the car . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested his finger in the hollow of her throat . " So , where are we going ? " he asked . <p> Della directed him to Walter 's house , to let him see for himself the custom window treatments . To increase the drama , she made Pete stay in the car when they got there , hurried inside to hit the floodlights Waiter had positioned under each of the olive trees . She swung the heavy front door wide and called , " Allee , allee , all come free . " <p> " Are we playing a game ? " he said when he came to the door . <p> " Of course , " she said , unable to stop laughing , knowing he would kiss her before she could so much as close the door . They did n't even get to the dining room before they were on their knees , making noises from high in their throats , and Della , thinking of Walter 's pride in his thick carpet , dug her fingers harder into Pete 's arms . <p> When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them-an owl outside , and the wind through eucalyptus leaves making a sound like silk . Wealth , she realized , bought this plush quiet . She 'd never thought of it before . From here she could probably hear the sound of the planets . Turning her head , she listened to the air , taking it in like sweet water . Distant gulls . The light wind . And then the sound of a car . <p> " Get up . " She pulled on Pete 's arm ; he was logy , half asleep . " Get up ! " She was already shoving her bare feet into shoes , tucking panty-hose into her purse , shaking her hair to make it uniformly wild ; she could blame it on an open car window . She checked the rug , but it did n't show a mark , and she blessed Walter again for always buying quality . <p> As she heard Walter 's footsteps in from the garage , Della yanked Pete into the far corridor , where she flipped the lights first on , then off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor plan , " she said loudly . <p> " Della ? " She heard the dread in Walter 's voice , and she marched Pete into the kitchen , talking fast , as hard as she could , introducing Pete , the banker Walter himself had sent her . Walter 's eyes skated over the two of them , and he licked his lips several times . <p> " I 'm sorry we did n't warn you , Walter . We were in a late meeting , and I knew you were planning to be out . " <p> Pete said , " I might have a buyer . Della here was explaining that you want to move quickly . " He rested his hand on her shoulder , and she shuddered it off . <p> " Very , " Walter said . Della watched his eyes flick away from her , and , panicking , she laid her hand on his arm and walked him into the laundry room , leaving Pete to inspect cupboards . <p> " I 'm so glad you came in , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been sidestepping him all night . " <p> " I gathered , " Walter said , looking at Della 's lips , which she knew were frowzy and swollen . <p> " We can see him out ; he brought his own car . You can take me home later . Walter ? " She squeezed his arm as he half turned from her , and she took a shaky , chastised breath . Her eyes flooded then , and her voice cracked . " Walter , please . " <p> Finally he turned back and met her eyes ; his were dry . " He 's cheap , " Walter said . " I 'm surprised you had anything to do with him . " <p> Della pressed her lips against the responses that needled up in her . Had Walter ever taken a breath he had n't thought about three times first ? Did he ever get tired of his tiny , impeccable life ? Just looking at him made Della long to get stupid drunk . <p> " I want him out of here , " Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning off the light as he went , an infuriating bit of chintziness . Della thought of the new moon , the starry doors open above her . Doors , she thought , could also be closed . She smoothed her hands on her skirt and found that her blouse was tucked up at the back , showing half an inch of skin . She ran her finger across the spot . " The hell with it . " <p> When she came back into the kitchen both men turned toward her , and Pete reached out his cupped hand . " I guess I 'd better take you home , " he said . <p> " No need , " she said , and smiled . <p> " No , " Walter agreed , his voice tight . <p> " The night is young , " Della said . " There 's still time for a little business . " Still smiling , trembling , she crossed to the telephone and dialed from memory , counting hand-painted tiles to keep from looking at the men . Her breath was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to say , " Hi , Trish . I was hoping I 'd catch you . " Loudly , so both men could hear . <p> <p> By ERIN McGRAW <p>
