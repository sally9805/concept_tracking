<p> SILENCE <p> DEATH <p> Editor  --  It is interesting that in your editorial , " A Puzzling Union " ( Chronicle , December 10 ) , you included Secretary of State James Baker 's statement that in the Soviet Union there is a " risk " of seeing " a situation created there not unlike what we have seen in Yugoslavia . . . " What your editorial failed to mention was that last June , Baker 's hostility towards the secession of Croatia and Slovenia gave the green light for the Yugoslav army to invade those two republics . Much of the responsibility for the chaos in the former Yugoslavia lies with James Baker , George Bush and other Western leaders , who by their silence and inaction in essence gave the Yugoslav federal army unofficial approval to attack Slovenia and ravage Croatia . Let us hope that they will deal more responsibly with the individual republics of the Soviet Union as well as the Red Army . <p> ED BOSNAR <p> Santa Clara <p> ROYALTY 'S ROLE <p> Editor  --  I am writing in regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle , December 6th ) . I want to thank you for articulating  --  and publishing  --  what 2 million Croatians and their descendants in the United States are feeling today . <p> Croatia is a country that is over 13 centuries old . Croatia was a country before the creation of a Yugoslavia . When the United States declared its independence from the British in 1776 , Croatia was the first European country to recognize this new country and respected its break from England ! <p> ( I am an American-born citizen of Croatian descent . Although I descend from Croatian monarchs , I am supportive of a democratic republic and personally feel , like many others , that royalty can play a role in any country 's economy by promoting its history and thus its tourism . ) <p> HRH PRINCESS SUSAN <p> Foster City <p> EASY FINANCIAL RIDE <p> Editor  --  In her column , " Toasting the Heroes Who Fought Fascism " ( December 11 ) , Marilyn Geewax states , " Those returning men may have been the most blessed generation in the nation 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic growth helped provide them with good-paying jobs , decent benefits and comfortable homes . " They reaped the benefits of postwar social programs and economic growth , and quickly forgot that their benefits came from government programs supported by taxes . <p> The World War II generation became the mainstay of the " Reagan revolution " that destroyed labor unions . They constantly lobby for less taxes to support the types of social programs they enjoyed , and press for more Social Security benefits . Very few of them came from families that owned their own homes and paid property taxes to support education and other social programs that were available ; but they support measures such as Proposition 13 now that they are homeowners . <p> Vietnam veterans did not have the easy financial ride through college , nor have they been able to buy their dream homes , because the World War II generation continued to want more for less taxation . <p> To forestall accusations of generational bias and lack of patriotism of the type made in response to a previous letter of mine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be scrapped , note that I am an Army veteran of World War II , Korea and Vietnam . <p> NATHAN PLOTKIN <p> San Rafael <p> HOLDING THE BAG <p> Editor  --  The op-ed piece about the " Twentysomethings " ( Chronicle , December 10 ) barely touches the reasons for my generation 's disgust with the political system . These Harvard writers want to build a " constituency dedicated to responsible government , " saying we have no excuse to ignore the political process because the price is too high . <p> My generation , however , is far outnumbered by our elders , none of whom care to help pay the price for the disaster they have fostered . Of course , that 's because most of our elders do n't like to think of the country 's situation as a disaster . After all , they voted for Reagan and Bush . <p> Are these pundits arguing for an ageist political movement ? Shall we cast the children against the parents ? After all , as the statistics show , the older generation holds a greater percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money buys the senator 's vote . . . we 're outnumbered and outdollared . <p> The last decade has been a national disgrace , and those who helped land us here will be long gone when the bills truly come due . We wo n't be twentysomethings for long , but we will be left holding the bag . Maybe we should learn to expect to never own property and earn far less than our parents . That way , when the system falls on its face , we will have far less to lose than our elders . <p> DAVID SAMUELS <p> San Francisco <p> THE LICK MONUMENT <p> Editor  --  As a long time friend of the public library , I am horrified that those involved in constructing the new library building would consider destroying a piece of history . As the only survivor of the earthquake of 1906 , the Lick Monument demarks the actual location of the pre-1906 City Hall . The Lick Monument marks the time and place of the quintessential event in local history . Yet the planners would for no good reason despoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Lick made a gift of $ 100,000 for the monument on condition that said monument would be " at City Hall . " The " City Hall " he meant in that phrase was the building constructed after 1873 in the old Yerba Buena Cemetery , a building intended by its builders to last . So Lick meant a specific location as a condition to his gift . Any plan to move the monument therefore violates the legal terms of the Lick Trust . <p> It is utterly unnecessary for this city which enshrines history to violate the trust of this former civic benefactor . A new main library will occupy an entire city block , yet can not share one little corner for this monument to history . Can not room for the few functions in that corner set out in the new plans be found in the remainder of the entire block allotted to the new Main Library ? <p> In this historic time , monuments seem to be falling all over the world . However , no good reason exists to tear down this one . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devastating earthquake , this monument has earned its right to survive . <p> GARY MICHAEL COUTIN <p> San Francisco <p> CIVIC CENTER PLAN <p> Editor  --  The article entitled " Big Plan for S.F. 's Civic Center " ( Chronicle , December 16 ) was well researched and well written by Ingfei Chen . <p> There is one additional idea that might be of interest to all concerned and came from Mario Ciampi in his discussions with Henry Hopkins and me back in 1978 . Mr. Hopkins was then the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and I was his deputy . Mr. Ciampi , of course , is an internationally-known architect here . The three of us had many a discussion within the museum about our spaces and the future of the entire Civic Center . Mr. Ciampi 's idea is simple , imaginative and quite inexpensive . <p> The idea is to tie City Hall more closely with the War Memorial buildings across Van Ness , all three of which were designed by Arthur Brown . The plan would be to place special bricking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of City Hall to the Memorial Courtyard between the Opera House and the museum building . In addition , the present median strip down Van Ness from McAllister to Grove would not only be interrupted mid- block by the above plan , but would be replaced by something far more attractive . <p> Henry Hopkins thought that a work by an artist using rock or some similar natural material would be a good solution . The lights mid-block would eliminate the need for pedestrians to dash across Van Ness . <p> In this manner , the Civic Center would be more cohesive for historical , architectural , practical and festive reasons . <p> I hope these ideas are of value . <p> MICHAEL McCONE <p> California Historical Society <p> San Francisco <p> OBSERVATIONS <p> Editor  --  The recent National Food Brokers convention in San Francisco gave me the opportunity to meet with many friends and business associates from across the country . All these contacts have been frequent visitors to San Francisco . <p> Frequent and unsolicited observations made by these visitors to San Francisco included : <p> * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many aggressive panhandlers on the streets . <p> * The very filthy streets . <p> I only can hope that the people who can will do something about these problems and soon . <p> WAYNE STEFANIAK <p> San Rafael
