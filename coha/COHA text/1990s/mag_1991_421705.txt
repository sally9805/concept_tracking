Today 's money changing is slowed by multiple monetary systems . Are we ready for <p> In 1869 the British economist and journalist Walter Bagehot published a pamphlet called " The Assimilation of the English and American Money as a Step toward a Universal Money . " <p> " Commerce is everywhere identical , " he wrote 122 years ago . " Buying and selling , lending and borrowing , are alike all the world over , and all matters concerning them ought universally to be alike too .... Ultimately the world will see one Code de Commerce , and one money as the symbol of it . " <p> Bagehot 's " world economy " consisted primarily of America and Europe . And in Bagehot 's time there were no airplanes , no telephones , no computers , and no fax machines to bridge international time zones and challenge the ability of nations to control their own economies . Yet his arguments for a universal currency closely resemble those being advanced today for a single European or an even more global currency . Proponents say that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dealing with fluctuating exchange rates to enter international markets ; eliminate fees paid by consumers and businesses whenever currency is converted ; promote worldwide trade , investment , and job creation by cushioning businesses and nations against the uncertainties caused by unpredictable exchange rates . <p> In the last decades of the twentieth century we have seen the arrival of a global economy and such widespread acceptance of the dollar that some even call it an " international currency . " This has occurred despite fundamental changes in world currency systems , from the gold-backed dollar to the floating currency we have today . Major economic powers have struggled to establish systems for cushioning their economies against fluctuations in exchange rates . And on a global level , many nations link the value of their own currencies to the value of others , such as the French franc or the U.S. dollar . Yet most independent nations-except for a few that belong to currency unions  --  continue to issue their own currencies and use them within their borders . Development of communications and more efficient transport spawned not only global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and sold in a third , but also breathtakingly fast movements of money around the globe , from one country to another , one industry to another , and one currency to another . <p> In such a " small " world , an economic or political change  --  a hike in oil prices , for example  --  can have an instant global ripple effect . Economists say that in this situation the existence of multiple currencies  --  especially " floating " currencies whose relative values are constantly in flux  --  can dampen foreign investment and trade as well as the growth of employment opportunities and consumers ' choices among products and prices . <p> Despite the theoretical benefits it might offer , creation of a universal currency is far from commanding the attention of economists or world political leaders in the Nineties . But interest in the concept of at least reducing the number of world currencies has been heightened by the European Community 's ( EC ) drive to establish its own currency to maximize the advantages of the " single market " scheduled to go into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange counter at Kennedy International Airport , you cash in dollars for traveler 's checks and a pocketful of coins and bills , both denominated in European Currency Units , or ecus . With this money you breakfast on coffee and croissants in Paris , purchase stamps and postcards in Rome , and settle your hotel bill in Amsterdam . You do not watch your travel budget being frittered away by commissions required to change your dollars into francs , your francs into lira , or lira into guilders . The ecu is not just a fantasy . It 's not used in the cafes of Paris and not traded in foreign exchange markets , but a European currency called the ecu does already exist . It is used primarily for financial transactions and for keeping accounts among the EC 's member countries . <p> The existing ecu has not replaced the traditional currencies of the 12 nations of the EC ; in fact , its value is set by a formula that takes into account the relative values of the German mark , the French franc , and the currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatile than any individual currency . <p> But the approach of the 1992 deadline for a single market free of physical , technical , and financial barriers to trade , and the concept that " one market needs one money , " have intensified interest in restructuring the monetary system and creating a new European currency that would be used throughout the EC-not in addition to , but instead of the national currencies-and that would be accepted globally . ( If the EC agreed on a new currency , it would not necessarily be called the ecu . ) <p> What is the significance of the move to create a single European currency ? Is a common currency necessary for free trade ? Do we really need a global currency ? Is it desirable ? Could it happen in our lifetime ? How could it happen ? Who would issue the currency ? Would individual nations have to give up their sovereignty ? <p> Proponents of the single currency-which would be a feature of a unified monetary system  --  say it would eliminate inefficiency and the expense of exchange transactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations in exchange rates , and increase Europe 's ability to compete against the United States and Japan . <p> Great Britain , the only member of the EC to raise serious objections , has suggested that giving up the pound sterling would mean relinquishing its national sovereignty , and has proposed instead that the EC create a thirteenth currency that would compete with the other 12 . Other questions are primarily technical , related to the search for a way to link the economies of 12 countries that have different rates of inflation , living standards , deficits , and interest rates without exacerbating , instead of resolving , economic hardships . These sorts of issues , raised by the current negotiations on European economic unity , would also arise in the event of a movement to create a global currency , <p> Prospects for a truly global currency seem so far-out to most economists and even to futurists that there are no well-developed plans or proposals for creating one . Even the World Federalist Association , which advocates " political and economic integration on the world level , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to field director Scott Hoffman , " it could happen only as a by-product " of a world government . <p> Some economists and politicians who have looked into the future , however , see the outlines not of a global currency , but of a common currency for the major economic powers-the United States , Europe , and Japan-and any others that might want to tag along . <p> For instance , this proposal surfaced in the British magazine The Economist a few months after the October 1987 stock market crash : " Thirty years from now , Americans , Japanese , Europeans , and people in many other rich countries and some relatively poor countries will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency ... let 's say the phoenix . The phoenix will be favored by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today 's national currencies , which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the late twentieth century . " <p> Admitting that their readers might have found the idea " outlandish " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal again in 1990 , observing that " the new momentum towards European monetary union has put the world somewhat ahead of schedule " in moving toward a common currency for the industrial countries . <p> No group has put the proposal for a " phoenix zone " on a negotiating table . But the underlying concept remains alive-in fact , it garnered some attention before the article appeared in The Economist . <p> For example , Richard N. Cooper , a Harvard University economist who served as under secretary of state for economic affairs in the Carter administration , published in the early Eighties a proposal for a common currency for the industrial democracies , calling it " too radical for the near future " and suggesting that it serve as a " Vision " or goal for the longer term . <p> One reason proponents of a more global currency are so cautious about their predictions is that creating a viable currency involves more than just minting coins or printing paper bills . According to Cooper , having a common currency implies a common monetary policy and an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the money supply . The economists interviewed for this article say that the toughest barriers to be overcome are political , not economic . <p> Says Gary Hufbauer , a Georgetown r University economist who is an authority on European unification : " A common currency is the last stage of a lot of other integration that should take place first-freeing up trade , making migration easier , reconciling technical standards . " When these preliminary steps have been taken , he says , you could get a ground swell . " At that point people will ask : Why are we dealing with all of these different currencies ? " he says . <p> Because currency is produced by governments , which use it to enshrine their kings and queens and presidents and symbols of them , it is sometimes assumed that a world currency could exist only if nations gave up their sovereign rights . But Bagehot , Cooper , and the editorial board of The Economist , among others , all argue that although difficult , it might be possible to create a supranational monetary system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , budgetary , and taxation policies . <p> Contemporary examples of this approach exist in Africa , where there are two monetary unions , each consisting of several independent nations whose currencies are pegged to the French franc ; and in Europe , where Luxembourg accepts the Belgian franc as legal tender , although the policy is not reciprocated by all Belgians . <p> Cooper points out that in a monetary union of the major industrial democracies , each nation could even continue to print its own currency-with its own political symbols-as long as the value of the currency was set by the international system . <p> In the United States , 50 states share a currency and a monetary policy that controls the flow of money ; yet currency is issued by 12 different Federal Reserve banks , and each state manages its own fiscal or internal budget policy . A similar model may be emerging in Europe , where a regional bank or other authority would issue the currency and control its supply , while each country would retain control of its fiscal policy . <p> Estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it really will happen-vary widely . During 1991 , finance ministers of the EC are meeting as part of the first stage ( determining how the basic charter , the Treaty of Rome , would have to be amended ) of a three-stage process designed to lead to a single currency . In the second stage , the EC would create a central bank to work with the central banks of member nations toward stage three : irrevocably locked exchange rates and then , a single currency . But regardless of how long it may take , scenarios for a common currency of the industrialized democracies seem to assume that adoption of a single European currency would be a step toward , and perhaps even a prerequisite for , creating a broader currency union involving Europe , the United States or North America , and Japan . <p> Whether this type of union implies a leap to a global currency is another matter . " The sine qua non for a common currency must be a common defense arrangement so that the countries are not going to fight each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Robert Mundell , an economist at Columbia University , who suggests that a common language and culture are also important bases for monetary union . <p> " If the world consisted of five hundred nations of ten million people each and we did n't have a big China , a powerful United States , and a Soviet Union , we 'd inevitably have to have a world currency , " he says . But as long as there are supereconomies , he speculates , it 's more likely that world trade will rely on several major currencies . <p> Even the proliferation of free trade zones , economists say , does not necessarily imply use of a common currency . In his book Megatrends 2000 , John Naisbitt declares that there is " a big , powerful , overarching megatrend ... toward worldwide free trade , " citing as examples accords between the United States and Canada ; the pending United States-Mexico pact ; the Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement reviewed in 1988 ; and the possibility that a Brazil-Argentina agreement could eventually form the nucleus of a South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , Europe , and Japan to form a golden triangle of free trade " in the next century , but does not go on to predict that such trading blocs might merge their currencies , let alone forge a global currency system . <p> " There is no necessary connection between a free trade area and a common currency area , " Cooper says . Explains Ralph C. Bryant , an economist at the Brookings Institution : " There 's not an epsilon of a suggestion that the Canadian dollar or the Mexican peso should be pegged to the U.S. dollar . " <p> Bryant , who emphasizes that he is not an active advocate of a global currency , does support closer international economic cooperation . " Rather than pulling back from financial interdependence , " he says , national governments should increase " multilateral decision making " by paying greater attention to the effects of their economic decisions on other nations , and strengthening international organizations . <p> Asked to speculate about how and whether a world currency might evolve by the year 2050 , Bryant said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decades at the same pace as it has in recent decades , " preconditions for establishing the currency would include " a greatly strengthened global financial institution , a truly international legislative organization , and a level of international cooperation higher than in the Nineties . " <p> It 's difficult to know whether the creation of a global currency will take its place on the international agenda in our lifetime . The pace and surprise of economic and political developments just in the last two years-the thawing of the Cold War and the eruption of war in the Middle East-make economists and futurists wary of predicting even a decade ahead , let alone two or three or five decades . <p> What remains clear is that powerful forces are propelling the world further down the road of economic interdependence , that political institutions increasingly need to catch up , and that any country which assumes it can insulate itself from the world economic system and still prosper faces the risk of becoming an anachronism . <p> Futurist Alvin Toffler has written that the rise of " global gladiators " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the environmental movement-has generated momentum for " all sorts of new global institutions . " But whether one of these should be a new international monetary structure with a world currency , or whether some other alternative-such as returning to a system of fixed exchange rates-would be equally effective in promoting stability and deterring unwanted economic surprises , is still being debated . <p> For one thing , as Cooper points out , the communications technology that has propelled us toward global economic interpedendence has  --  by allowing for worldwide , instant currency transactions  --  made managing and manipulating the world 's many money systems increasingly easier . <p> For the moment , given the existence of few economic superpowers and the formidable issues surrounding achievement of a world order based on more equitable power sharing , for all but the most futuristic thinkers , the basic question about whether to strive for an international currency is likely to remain : <p> In a world where we can beat our dollars into Deutsche marks and our Deutsche marks into yen by issuing a simple command through the phone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a global currency ? <p> By ELLEN HOFFMAN <p>
