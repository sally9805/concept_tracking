In 1980 , Roderick Bell , an Ohio state dropout turned businessman , bought two trucks as a tax write-off . Today Bell 's firm , Texas American Express , shelters mainly profit . Sales are heading toward $12 million , and 80 freight trucks  --  whose colors range from salmon to emerald green to pink because employees can pick the shades they please  --  ply the roads from its modest base in Dallas to the Northeast and the West Coast . Bell is a success  --  and he has to work harder than ever to stay that way . <P> " We would n't be in this business if it were n't for deregulation , " says Bell , who treats Texas American as a full-time job when he is n't looking after his insurance company , his used-car lot and his plastics-molding company . The barrier that had to be overcome was the heritage of the Interstate Commerce Commission , which opened routes only to trucker applicants who demonstrated need for the service , with , for example , affidavits from shippers . Carriers also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truckers ' business , and the number of ICC licenses was restricted . <P> The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 defined the industry 's road to deregulation . Since then , the number of truckload haulers such as Bell has multiplied about threefold , to nearly 60,000 . The act also unleashed such new rivals as United Parcel Service to take away customers from the complacent . " If you look at the list of the 100 biggest companies in the business in 1979 before deregulation , today there are only nine or 10 left , " says Thomas J. Donohue , president and CEO of the American Trucking Association . <P> Bell has been around too long to be called an upstart  --  and his is n't one of the 100 biggest firms  --  but he still goes flat-out to stay ahead of fierce competition . Says Bell : " Success is never guaranteed in our industry . " Last year was the first in a decade that Texas American lost money ; this year is profitable so far . It is one measure of how deregulation has helped both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so less a mile for hauling than when he entered the business in the ' 80s . " Deregulation has taken $50 billion out of the cost of trucking services from 1979 to 1997 , " says Donohue . " As a result , we are spending 15% less to move the nation 's goods by truck . " <P> Technology is helping . Bell says his trucks need an overhaul only every 1 million miles instead of 300,000 . They need an oil change every 30,000 miles instead of 10,000 . In 1979 many trucks got 4 m.p.g. ; now they average 7 . Computers allow more timely , efficient service . <P> Competition is spreading off the interstates and onto state roads , where a federal law further deregulated trucking in 1995 . Texas truckers were among the most protected . But now , for example , an operator from Oklahoma can poach on Texas locals ' business . Bell says he has not tried to haul within his state " because we do n't have a need . " In other words , he 's got all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>  --  Reported by Deborah Fowler/Houston
