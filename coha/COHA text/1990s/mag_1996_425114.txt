Part of winter 's magic is the world it makes visible , a world hidden in other seasons . The snow has stories to tell , of survival and death and play . In our backyard we may notice how the neighbor 's cat was treed by the dog who circled and waited , a tale told through snowprints only . And in the white wilderness we may see writ large the epics of the beasts who struggle through the cruelest months  --  the elk felled by the mountain lion , the mountain lion treed by a pack of wolves  --  as we ski in their tracks . Using skis and radio receivers , wildlife biologists working on the Wolf Ecology Project study the gray wolf . Last winter , a team of six biologists followed three wolf packs through Glacier National Park and into British Columbia , noting their travel patterns , their diet , and their impact on other wildlife , especially big-game species like elk , deer , and moose . The predator-prey research will help scientists predict how the wolves will fare when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reintroduced , as they were in Yellowstone National Park . The leader of the predator-prey project is red-headed , redbearded Kyran Kunkel , 29 , a PhD candidate in wildlife biology at the University of Montana . Kyran is the kind of person who reads scientific journals for fun and discusses them over breakfast . He 's almost the archetype of the preoccupied scientist : He does n't say hello when he first sees me at the door of his primitive cabin , as if his mind is on something more important . This is his third year on the 15-year-old project . Kyran has suffered me to join him and his biology technicians for a few days of skiing in Montana 's North Fork Valley , a remote wilderness bereft of plumbing or electricity on the Canadian border . The North Fork is peopled with society 's misfits , those who seek to escape civilization . They are outnumbered by their nonhuman neighbors , the " charismatic megafauna , " as the scientists call them : grizzly bear , wolverine , coyote , lynx , and fisher , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also lousy with " megafauna groupies "  --  wildlife biologists . In this habitat , I  --  a writer and urban dweller  --  am an alien species . It 's a frigid , snowy day in December , and Kyran is outfitted in his usual ski duds : green wool Belgian army fatigues , fingerless gloves , and a ragged wool watch cap . With us is Steve Lewis , one of five new biology techs just arrived in the North Fork to help Kyran with his research for the winter . Steve , 24 , fulfills the most basic requirements of the job : He can ski ; he can get along with others in close quarters for months on end ( techs live together in a log cabin ) and he 's willing to work for $400 a month before taxes . He also got the job because of his degree in biology and two years of field work studying ungulates : horned and hoofed animals like deer , elk , and moose . " It 's a black and white world out there , " says Steve Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wolves and bears for travel . The pines stand like black sentinels in a gentle white snowfall . The white flanks of the mountains disappear into low , heavy clouds . We 're tight together in the cab of Kyran 's truck , rolling with the icy curves , on our way to ski behind the South Camas wolf pack in Glacier National Park . " Actually , what we do is more like bushwhacking than skiing , " Kyran warns me . Even his skis are called Bushwackers  --  stubby , wide , metal-edged jobs , short enough so they do n't catch in the overhead branches when lashed to his day pack . Some of the only skiing we are to do on our first day of tracking is a brief glide over new snow from the road down to the shore of the North Fork of the Flathead River . Once beside the river 's icy banks , our task is to get across and into the park on the opposite shore . We wade across in chest waders , our skis lashed to our backpacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles for support against the swift , perfectly clear current . The icy water rises over our hips and laps at the rubber waders ; the current pulls hard . The trick , I learn none too quickly , is to face up and across the stream , bracing myself with my ski poles , like a second pair of legs . Adrenaline braces me , too , at the prospect of just one slip on the pebbly river bottom . Once ashore , we hang the waders in a tree . It 's now 1 P.M. , and the next six hours will cull the journalists from the scientists , the merely curious from the supremely dedicated . We 're in a level , low-lying area dense with spruce and fir . The wolves like this location because it 's a deer yard  --  an area where the deer huddle in the winter . The deer like it because there is plenty of food and cover , and the snow does n't get very deep . We spend the next few hours hiking in our heavy telemark boots , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the low branches of spruce and fir , creating crowns of twigs in our hair and depositing small avalanches of snow down our collars . Wolf tracks are everywhere , crisscrossing in the shallow snow . They are indistinguishable from large dog tracks , but we know there are no dog packs here . We ca n't tell how many wolves made the tracks , but on Sunday , Kyran says , he saw 10 wolves while radio-tracking the South Camas pack from a small plane , and he knows there are 11 or 12 in the pack . Kyran takes out a topographic map , takes our bearings , then marks our location with a red wax pencil . He measures the distance from the wolf tracks to the first deer track , about three paces . Then the scientists estimate the age of the wolf tracks and measure their depth . We scout around to note any other tracks  --  lion , coyote , martin , deer , elk . " Gives us an idea of the prey availability , " says Kyran . Kyran has copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habitat type . " We 're in a spruce/cottonwood forest , " he says . If we find a kill site  --  that is , a place where an animal was killed and devoured  --  he 'll also fill out a carcass data sheet . The map will provide a means of tracking that will go into the map ping computer at the University of Montana . Soon we come across some yellow snow , and Kyran immediately drops his day pack and takes out some Ziploc bags . He kneels and sniffs the stuff , then cuts some of the slush out with his hunting knife and holds it up for me to smell . It 's strong and musky  --  the smell of wolf . Kyran collects the urine to bait traps next spring so the project can snare more wolves and fit them with radio collars . Deep in the heavy woods now , clambering over logs and under dense branches , we follow the tracks of the wolves . It is n't up to us where we are going and I have to squelch my impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our irrefutable guides . As we follow their tracks , I see the wolves in my mind 's eye , loping along the deer trails , eyes yellow and bright , tongues lolling . We go where they go , see what they see ; we are at their mercy . Kyran stops under an enormous fir and points to its trunk with his ski pole . There 's a snarled maze of wolf tracks under the tree and long scrapes on the tree bark where claws seized hold . " Looks like they treed a mountain lion here , " Kyran observes . Wolves chase lions for fun and to push them off their hunting grounds  --  just like the neighborhood wars that go on every day between dog and cats . " We never suspected there was so much competition between wolves and lions for deer , " Kyran adds . Lions and wolves have distinctly different hunting styles . Lions will sit and wait for a deer to come to them , then kill swiftly and efficiently in a pounce . They usually bury their kill to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a pack , especially in deep timber , worrying the deer until they finally bring it down , a much messier process . They will devour the animal at once , with each wolf carrying off a piece of the carcass . Bears are usually scavengers . Contrary to popular belief , bears  --  especially grizzlies  --  sometimes stay out all winter . One of the hazards of working on the Wolf Ecology Project is skiing up to a kill site only to find a grizzly gnawing on the remains of a wolf or lion kill it has commandeered . Farther along the wolf trail , now intertwined with the hoofprints of deer , we find more yellow snow and we all bend down for another sniff . This time it is deer urine ; it has a sweet smell , like ginger . The deer are safer in the dense timber here because the network of deer trails allows easy escape through the trees . This deer yard is frequented by whitetails , who alert each other to danger by raising their tails . Although scientists do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to notify a wolf that it has been spotted so do n't bother chasing . In this way , both wolves and deer would save energy , which is especially precious in winter . By late afternoon we reach an open meadow with a meandering stream , a frozen wolf highway . The tracks flow down the snow-covered ice like water , and we ski after . Big event : a little something a wolf left behind . Kyran gets out another bag to store the scat , which is lightly dusted with snow , but this time he does n't offer a whiff  --  there are deadly parasites we could inhale . It is stowed , like the urine , in Kyran 's day pack , where it awaits its fate as trap bait and as a lab specimen so the scientists can see what its donor was eating . Along the banks of the stream we find very fresh lion tracks . They are about the size of wolf tracks , but rounder and with two indents on the rear pad . They are so fresh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just narrowly missed seeing the big cat , and it is probably watching us . Darkness falls long before we return to our river crossing , and we struggle through the fallen timber in the gloom , branches scraping our faces . Kyran and Steve actually accomplish this on skis , skiing across the trunks of downed trees ; in the dark they seem airborne . I take my skis off and get out my headlamp while they blaze a trail ahead , leaving me behind . Later I find out why Kyran did n't seem worried about getting back  --  there are fully stocked and bear-proofed cabins nearby , used by the biologists for base camps or emergencies . We arrive at the river 's edge cold , wet , and scraped , and I am exhausted . Our waders are frozen so solid that we must lie down to get back into them . But as we prepare to wade across , we hear them : low , mournful wails in the night , the wolves sending us on our way . The next day , we set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the North Fork road toward the Canadian border . Judy Putera , a wildlife tech , is with us today . Putera has a master 's degree in biology and has inventoried flying squirrels for the U.S. Forest Service . She says she heard the wolves in the area yesterday , but now there is no sound of them . Every few miles Kyran stops the truck , turns on a radio receiver , and flips swiftly through the channels , hoping to hear a beep . Each wolfs radio collar has its own frequency , and if he hears a beep , Kyran knows which wolf is in the vicinity , prompting him to mark an " A " for " alive " on his data sheet and note the location . On our fourth stop there is still no signal . But the snow is deep and beckons us into the sun , so we snap on our skis and head over the hills , on a snowed-in road to the river . Almost immediately we come across day-old wolf tracks , made by several animals and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scat and urine for Kyran to collect . It 's cloudy to the east , and soon soft snow begins to fall through the sunshine , a veil of powder we ski through . A half mile shy of the river , we lose the tracks , though we 've taken care to make sure any tracks veering off the road are from other animals . We have no choice but to turn back , exploring along the way all manner of side trails and stopping to inspect possibilities . But the trail is too cold ; the wolves have vanished . How about lunch ? " asks Kyran . We put our day packs between us and the snow , and refuel , sunning ourselves in the crystalline air . Kyran tells of the March day he took a boat across the river instead of wading , only to return at night and find the boat gone . There was nothing to do but drop his wool fatigue pants , leave on his boots for traction , and wade across the North Fork in his boxer shorts . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . The boat was later found downstream in some brush . It is n't much of a mystery who took the boat . Local hostility toward the Wolf Ecology Project is well-known . Some oppose it because they hate wolves ; others , surprisingly , because they love wolves . " Some people are opposed to the intrusiveness of research , " Kyran explains . " Trapping is definitely a stress to the animal . But it is the only way to do the work , and you hope in the long run that what you learn will benefit them . " On my last day in the North Fork , I decide to ski alone in the park at dusk , hoping for wolf communion . Soft , pink light caresses the drifts , and the steep pitch of the surrounding mountains is held in the clouds , pregnant with perpetual snow . The tips of my turquoise skis stick out from the white depths like the snouts of two water serpents , swiftly flowing through a still lake . And with me , in the tracks beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes glowing . Then , off in the distance , echo their sharp wails . Those are real . <p>
