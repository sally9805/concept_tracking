 | The castle was quite empty . She knew she was lone , and she liked it that way . It was peaceful . She looked in the mirror . Not bad , not had at all . She had on a white dress , made of gossamer lace . It had a low square neck and was gathered under her breasts , then dropped to the ground with a slight flare at the bottom . The material was light and transparent , so she wore a white satin shift beneath it . Rose pink scarves were tied to the cuff of each puffed translucent sleeve and trailed almost to the ground . Her fine pale hair was tied up on top of her head and interwoven with rose pink ribbon . Her skin was white with a touch of color in the cheeks , her eyes a pale green . Her brow was high and unlined . She smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ; her lips full , just right for pouting . She tried a pout . Beautiful . Now what should she do ? She was dressed , she was ready , but for what ? A knight , perhaps . A dark-haired , wildly handsome fellow with a full dark beard who would bow before her  | and , in a low , passionate voice , tell her how beautiful she was , how tempting , how much he adored her . And then , then , he would leap up from his low bow in an unrestrained fit of passion and sweep her off her feet and But no , she did n't want that . Not really . After all , what fun could there be in being swept off your feet , bowled over by someone else 's strong will ? As if she was n't pushed around enough already by her own father and mother . And the dress  --  well , it was pretty , to be sure , but it was n't very practical . There was n't much else you could do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . She 'd try something else , something more adventurous . She closed her eyes for a moment , then gazed at herself in the mirror again . Now she saw herself in shiny black tights , high-heeled leather boots that reached to midthigh , a short tight purple jacket , and a small black pillbox hat that sat on the middle of her head . She felt the smooth material of the jacket and grinned . Just like something out of one of her fantasy books , where brave heroines fought battles and saved the world . As she thought of those books , the castle - changed around her . The large fireplace , huge upholstered chairs , and stone walls gave way to gleaming white walls and floors , low black stools , and glossy black sofas .  | But now what ? Aliens to fight , maybe . Slimy green spiderlike creatures with bulging red eyes and tentacles , oozing their way toward her across that gleaming white floor . As she thought it , still gazing into the mirror , she could see a wispy image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long slimy tube of horror No , she thought , a little frightened . Not that . That 's a bit too horrible . And anyway , she told herself , I 'd rather think of pleasant things . A perfect world , maybe . A world where she could have everything the way she wanted it . Now that would be something . She 'd make everything beautiful and perfect and interesting  --  never boring or dull . She 'd see to it that everybody was happy , even her parents , whether they liked it or not . She 'd make it just the way it ought to be . The way it would be , if only everybody was n't so stodgy and old-fashioned . But not today . Today she did n't want perfection . Or excitement , for that matter . It was all so tiring . Today she just wanted to relax , to give in to sheer pleasure and indulge herself . Perhaps her first impulse was the best , after all . It was a magnificent dress . And all she 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her thoughts . She returned to the castle and the lovely white dress , and told herself to relax and enjoy it . But as soon as she did relax a little , thoughts of that knight began  | to enter her head again , and she had to put some effort into keeping him from appearing at her feet . Suddenly , as if produced by her anxiety , a small pink dog appeared , materializing out of the air . " Oh , how sweet ! " she exclaimed aloud . This was much better than the knight . Much safer . The dog had a round nose , long ears , big eyes , short body , and small stubby legs  --  it looked very much like a puppy . A harmless puppy , the perfect companion . It barked . Another dog appeared at its side . This one was blue . Even better . Then another in green . Then purple , red , orange , yellow , brown , gray , black , white . She was very pleased . They were sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something to keep her busy and remind her of him . The pink one jumped up on her dress , just below the waist . The dress tore , the dog clawing its way down . " Do n't , " she laughed . But it did , again , and then it was joined by others . Soon they were all over her , clawing , nipping , biting . Her dress was in tatters . It was n't fun anymore . She decided to make them go away . They would n't . They would n't stop , and they would n't go away . She felt a surge of panic . Why could- n't she make them go away ? She turned and fled . She ran to the top of the stairs . The dogs were Tight behind her . She skipped , taking the steps ' three at a  | time , but she was n't fast enough . The dogs barked and yapped and began to howl . From where she stood , the staircase went down four floors . She sprang onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ruined already . Yes , now she was ahead of them . She reached the first landing , ran around to the top of the next flight , leaped onto the next banister , and slid down again . Her hair tumbled around her . If she could only get out the main door at the bottom and call for help . There would be servants below , gardeners outdoors ; someone would be there , had to be there . She willed them to be there . She could see the bottom now , and at the next landing , she leaned over the banister for a better view . A huge white form blocked the doorway . It was a massive white bear , very round , very beautiful , really . But she knew she would never get past it . And she did n't know where it had come from , could n't imagine where it had come from . That was the scariest part . What could she do now ? Ah-ha , she had it ! Her own room could be on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was there , just down the corridor , and there were instructions pasted up on the wall , what to do in case of emergency . She hurried down the hall and was relieved to find that the room was there , just as she 'd imagined it . She  | ran past the huge curtained bed and quickly began reading the instructions . No , not that one , that was for magicians , another for bad people , useless , ah , there it was , dogs . A recipe for dog trouble . And she had to use it fast ; they were on her trail now . She could see the pink one dart into the room . It barked , a sharp happy bark . She was trapped . She was theirs . Turn three times , she was reading so fast , she hoped it was right , saying in a low voice , " Dominic , Dominic , Dominic . " She did so . Her scarves waved gracefully around her as she turned and turned and said low , " Dominic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears . In front of them appeared a knight , dressed in armor , ten others with him , swords ready for battle . In unison they said , " At it , at it , at it , " as they struck down the animals . When all was quiet , the main knight removed his helmet and approached her . He was dark-haired and wildly handsome , with a square jaw and smoldering eyes . " Thank you , kind sir , " she said to him , holding out her hand . He shrugged and replied , " I 'm rather good at my job . " And he leaned over to kiss her hand . " Your  --  uh Your Highness ? " The timid voice came from behind her , ' but Lenora  | knew it belonged to Sylvie , her mother 's maid . And suddenly the knight was gone , and the castle too , and she was back in her real room . The mirror reflected just a simple blue shift reaching to the knees , white sandals , long straight blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that was , well , quite lovely , certainly  --  but surrounded by all this mediocrity , what did it matter ? So dreary , Lenora thought , gazing at her reflection . So dull . The room was plain , too . Pale pink walls , a four-poster bed , a small couch covered in a blue and white pattern , a fireplace , mahogany chests of drawers and wardrobe . Solid , handsome , practical , dull . Dull , dull , dull . " Well , Sylvie , " she sighed , not even bothering to turn around , " what is it ? " " Your Highness , your mother wishes to see you in her apartment . " Sylvie paused , then cleared her throat . " Uh  --  and she told me to tell you that she means now , right now . " Right now indeed . For a brief instant , Lenora wondered if she had n't been better off with the dogs and the bears .  | Just as she thought  --  her mother was steaming . " I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging around in the middle of nowhere , in some awful gray place , doing nothing for I do n't know how long ! And it was your fault , I know it was . You 've obviously defied my orders and imagined some silly world of your own again  --  and as usual , of course , it has to be a world where your dear , sweet mother does n't even exist . And right in the middle of my busiest time of the day , too ! A dinner menu to plan , towels to sort , housecleaning to supervise , and poof !  - -  the house is suddenly gone , and there I am , hanging around in that awful gray nothingness , for what seemed to be forever ! It was you , was n't it ? I know it was you , Lenora , it always is . Just what silly thing did you make up this time ? " Lenora tried to think of something harmless to tell her  --  she certainly did n't want her mother to know the truth , especially about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an answer . " Never mind , " she said , " I do n't really care . It was bound to be  | some childish fantasy or other . Some ridiculous romantic nonsense about dragons , or about knights that adore you like puppies . I know you , Lenora  --  you and your endless fantasy books . " Lenora blushed . " And , " her mother continued , getting angrier as she went on , " whatever it was , it was n't important enough to send me and everyone else in the house off into oblivion . This is it ! I put my foot down . Never again . Do you understand me ? Never again ! " " Yes , Mother , " Lenora pouted , kicking at the carpet and hoping that would be all . But she knew it would n't be . When Queen Savet got started on this topic it was almost impossible to stop her  --  it was like a rock rolling down a mountain . " Oh yes , " said Queen Savet , " you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took one look at you , and I knew . And I told your father , right then , just ask him and see if I did n't . Rayden , ' I said , you mark my words . ' And I was right , too ! The places I 've been ! The things you 've turned us all into ! It 's amazing we 're still here at all , young lady , and still in one piece . " Blah , blah , blah , thought Lenora . Next it would be t he talking chairs . " Like that awful time when we had the harvest fes-tival , " her mother continued . " I 'll never forget that , never . Important visitors from ten different countries ,  | and you had to make all the chairs in the banquet hall talk ! Talking chairs , of all things , telling everyone how they felt about being sat upon  --  even poor old Prince Hagupt , of all people . And for those who had the misfortune to be slightly overweight  --  well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeaning , to say the least ! " It is n't fair , Lenora thought . Will I never be allowed to forget that ? After all , I was only five years old ! And anyway , everyone always took the chairs for granted , just like they always take everything else in the whole stupid world for granted . And she could still remember all the wonderful confusion . Old Prince Hagupt had turned beet red and stormed out of the room , the pompous fool . " And then , " her mother , of course , continued , " making all the farm animals into stuffed toys that time  --  you were seven then , were n't you ? There was nothing to eat for a week but oatmeal porridge . I hate porridge ! " So do I , thought Lenora  --  but I made mine taste like roast beef . Why did n't you ? Why did n't anybody in this whole stupid country ever use their gift for anything interesting ? What was the point of being able to make whatever you imagine real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , her mother was about to tell her . Again . For a brief instant , she considered turning  | her mother into a frog . A slimy green frog , with a sock in its mouth to stop it from croaking on and on and on . But that would get her into even worse trouble . Better just listen and get it over with . " Oh , Lenora , Lenora , " Queen Savet wailed , " you 've studied your history . You know your politics . You know the struggles our ancestors had to go through before they finally figured out how to deal with our gift  --  the battles , the chaos . You know they thought long and hard about the best world for us Gepethians to live in , once they finally agreed to work together as a team . And once they created that world  --  this world , Lenora , the one we all share  --  they made a promise to keep it as it was until everyone agreed to change it ? everyone , acting together . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nobody ever consulted me about it , Lenora thought . She contented herself with just imagining the sock in her mind , its woolly end sticking out of the corner of her mother 's mouth . It was n't nearly as satisfying as actually making it happen . And it certainly did n't stop the flow of words . " It 's ; i good world , too , " her mother continued , " a good , balanced world . A place for everything , and everything in its place . Why ca n't you just accept it , like everybody else in Gepeth ? " Queen Savet paused , as if actually waiting for an answer . Lenora blinked the sock in her mind out of  | existence and tried to think of the right answer . Because it 's boring , she thought . Boring boring boring . " I do n't know , " she finally mumbled . But her mother did n't hear her . " And even if it were n't a good world , then we 'd change it by consensus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anybody else . Your father may be a king , Lenora , but he is n't a dictator , no matter what you think . No , Rayden ca n't just impose his will on others , Lenora , and neither can you . You ca n't . We 've told you that again and again , Lenora , again and again and again ! And yet there I was in that gray nothing for hours , and the towels not even folded ! " " I 'm sorry , Mother . " And she really was , too . It had been a stupid thing to do . If she had n't gotten carried away by that knight , she would have made sure everyone else had kept on existing somewhere else in some parallel world , maybe , where there were mountains of towels in need of folding and her mother would think she 'd died and gone to heaven . But then Lenora had another thought . " But Mother , if you did n't like me sending you off like that , " she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift , too . Could n't you have just imagined yourselves back here , and then you would have been here ? Why did it happen that way ? " " I do n't know , " Queen Savet grumbled . " I just do n't know . I tried , I certainly did try  --  when those towels  | will get done I ca n't imagine . You have more power than is good for anyone , Lenora , and well , frankly , I tried and I could n't do anything . You seem to be getting stronger day by day . If your father had n't been away , perhaps . . . " Her mother looked at Lenora questioningly , as if she were n't altogether certain about that . " At any rate , " her mother continued , " it 'll soon be over , thank goodness . On your seventeenth birthday you 'll be married , and all this nonsense will be over . Your husband will make sure of that . " Her husband indeed . She 'd like to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her words still echoed in Lenora 's head as she slammed the front door of the house behind her and stamped down the path , furious . How often would she have to listen to that lecture ? If she had to sit through it one more time she would go absolutely insane . Lenora stopped for a moment on the path , trying to shake off her anger at her mother , thinking about where to go . Lufa . She would visit Lufa . She was the only person Lenora could talk to . All the other adults were just like her mother , and as for people her own age , forget it they were all such cowards . Such good little Gepethians , never even changing the color of their hair . And anyway , she was rarely allowed contact with  | them . She was royalty after all , and as Queen Savet and King Rayden were constantly telling her , she could n't fraternize with just anyone . And yet everyone blindly agreed to it . What a stupid system ! The cobblestone pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lufa 's cottage through the winding streets of the village , angrily muttering to herself . And I wo n't marry ! she told herself . They ca n't make me . Marry ! So I can do nothing but sew , and make menus , and waste my time with all that useless practical stuff ! Why on earth did they decide on a world like this one , with so much boring work in it ? Why not one with machines that do everything for you ? I mean , here we are , using candles when we could just flip a switch and have light , like they do in fantasy books ! Or have machines to drive us , instead of horses . Or we could even fly in the air ! But no , not us , we have to leave things as they are just because the old fogies think it 's better that way ; we have to always worry about keeping the balance . The stupid balance . I hate the balance ! And anyway , she went on to herself , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're too old and tired to think up anything interesting anymore . Or even if they can , they do n't have the courage to do anything except write about it . They put it in books , and they 're happy just to sit around all day read-   ing about different ways of life instead of actually experiencing them . What cowards . Well , she murmured as she stalked up to Lufa 's cottage , that 's not enough for me . And I wo n't be bullied Into it ! Lufa 's door opened , just as Lenora had her hand up to knock . " Why Lenora , how nice . I was expecting you . In tact , " Lufa said , her musical laugh floating through the air , " I could feel you coming . Like one feels a storm cloud approaching . " Lenora let out a small giggle . " Only they make me so mad . " " Yes dear , " said Lufa , " I know . " Lenora was n't sure just how old Lufa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so different from her mother . She had an oval face with olive skin , dark hair cut into a bob , and large brown eyes . She was the medicine woman of the village , and she had a kindly word for everyone . " I 'm going to pick herbs in my garden , " Lufa said . " come along . " Lenora was grateful for the invitation . It would keep her mind occupied . Her feelings of restlessness seemed to be growing by the second , and , well , to be truthful , she was becoming fearful of creating another reality . It was n't her mother 's anger she minded , not really . She was used to that . No , it was losing control   that bothered her . Those dogs turning on her  --  and then , the bears . She was sure she had n't thought up those bears . Why had it gone wrong like that ? What had happened ? If her father had been home  --  well , maybe Lufa could help her figure it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage . It was really more like a small wood , cultivated with special herbs and plants , which eventually joined into the large forest that bordered the north end of the village . It was a restful place , and Lenora felt herself calming down as she helped Lufa and basked in the pleasantly warm morning sun . For almost an hour they worked in silence , Lufa cutting the herbs and leaves she needed , Lenora holding the wicker basket for her . Finally Lufa paused and picked up the flask of water , which was also in the basket . After taking a swig , she handed it to Lenora . By now the sun was at its peak , and Lenora was starting to feel its strength as it beat down on her head out of a cloudless blue sky . The cool water tasted wonderful . Lufa gazed at Lenora with concern as she drank . " What happened today ? " she asked finally . " I 'm not sure , " Lenora replied , taking another gulp from the flask . " I well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not supposed to , but I just could n't help it . Lufa , I just could n't . I was so bored . I imagined something out of one of my books , a perfectly harmless world . But then  --  well , it kind of took over , like in a   dream , and I was in real trouble for a while . I could n't control it . I imagined some instructions for getting out of it , finally . That was smart of me , was n't it ? " she risked anxiously . Lufa nodded . " But even so ... " Lenora stopped , unsure of how to continue . " But even so it scared you . " " Well . . . " Lenora did n't exactly want to admit that he had been frightened , even if she had every reason oo he . Those dogs and that bear were just as real as she nd Lufa were , after all . And so were their claws and eir teeth . She could still hear the sound of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt me ? " Lenora wrested . " I mean , if it got dangerous , I 'd always be Me to create something that would save me , would n't 1 Like I did today ? " Lufa looked at her thoughtfully . " I do n't know , Lenora , " she finally said . " I 'm not so nr of that . Your strength is growing by leaps and Hinds . The worlds you create are more real all the nee . It all comes down to yourself . Whether you real-c it or not , all the things you create come from somehere in your mind . " Lenora was about to protest . " Of course , " Lufa continued , " sometimes it 's a place u do n't know about , a dark place you 've hidden from   yourself . And those places are the most dangerous , I think . If you let what 's in them loose , you might well not be able to control it . That 's why we 've all agreed to keep the balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance , Lenora , " Lufa added as she noticed the dismayed look on Lenora 's face . " But you 're not the only one who feels that way . This questioning , this experimenting is a stage a lot of us Gepethians go through , when we 're young . Why , when your own mother was your age , she once ? " Lufa suddenly stopped in midsentence . But she had n't stopped soon enough . Lenora was astonished . Queen Savet , of all people , fooling around with the balance ? And then , having the nerve to give her that lecture ! What hypocrisy ! " What did she do ? " Lenora demanded . Lufa colored and turned away . " Never mind , " she said . " It 's not important . I only mean that you 're not the only one who ever skirted the balance a little , that 's all . But if you 're going to keep on doing it  --  as I 'm sure you are , Lenora then you have to learn to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I should work together . With me there to teach you control , you might learn to overcome the danger . " Lenora was shocked . She 'd expected Lufa to reassure her , not to respond like this . How could her own fantasies be so dangerous ? For a moment , an image of  | that slimy tentacle passed through her mind , and she quickly blotted it out . How could she have things like that hidden inside her ? She did n't want to think about it . " Why do n't you sit over there by the fountain , " Lufa suggested , noticing Lenora 's distress . " It 's cool and shady . I have a special plant to tend , and you look tired . I 'll be back in a few minutes , and we 'll decide what to do . " Thankfully , Lenora headed for the fountain . She was tired , and hot , and confused . She sank down on a stone bench underneath a huge elm . The cold stone hit into her bare legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she considered imagining it warmer , and then hesitated , and left it the way it was . She sat and stared at the pool . There was a little fountain in its center , a stone figure of a wolf standing on its hind legs , spewing rainbow droplets into the air . Small splashes in the pool hinted at the presence of fish . Lenora got up to take a closer look . She gazed into the water It rippled . And then she noticed a young man reflected in the pool , just behind her . A stranger . She whirled around . There was no one there . She turned in confusion and looked into the pool again . There he was , standing just behind her own iinage  --  hair an unruly carrot red , eyes grayish blue , skin white with freckles . He looked a little like a   clown , but his high cheekbones and full mouth , which turned up into a slight smile , made him seem almost handsome . Interesting , certainly . Again she turned around , as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pool , and this time she felt something drawing her . The boy was still there , his reflection rippling behind hers , but something else was there as well , in the pool , in the water . A force , beckoning her , compelling her toward it . Somehow she knew it was n't the boy producing the feeling . He looked far too terrified , now , for it to be him . No , it was something else . She began to concentrate on it . That force wanted her , needed her . She needed it . And then she was no longer looking into the pool . She was standing high on a mountain , looking out over a vast plain . The white spires of a magnificent city gleamed in the distance . Then the scene shifted . She was in a large group of people , and they were screaming a name , a name she could n't quite catch . And now they were cheering , wild with joy , and she was cheering with them . She was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt something she 'd never experienced before . It was a feeling of pure power . She could create , she could destroy at will . She flew over a world , crushing cities , throwing them away like so much garbage . She loved the sensation , reveled in it , rejoiced .   Suddenly she was once again staring into an ordinary pool of water  --  and immediately she became terrified by the feelings she had so enjoyed a moment before . Lufa was crouched in front of her , her fingertips resting on Lenora 's temple . " Lenora , " she said anxiously . " What is it ? What happened ? "   I since Coren stood in the middle of a forest , far from home , staring distastefully at his reflection in a mirror propped against the branch of a tree . He hated everything he saw there : the thin frame , the ridiculously pale white skin , the freckles . And worst of all , the hair , the flaming carrot-red hair . He looked like a clown . Some prize for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how little he resembled the sort of handsome knight in shining armor a princess would expect , he angrily tossed the soapy razor in his hand onto the leaf-strewn ground . Why had his mother asked King Rayden to give him the stupid razor ? Just because they were almost there in Gepeth , in that girl 's country , his mother all of a sudden started worrying about the way he looked , of all things . As if anybody in his family ever cared about how they actually looked , instead of just thinking themselves into a different appearance in their own minds . As if he could actually do anything about those freckles , that hair . As if it would make any difference .  | And the worst of it was , he did n't have one hair on his face worth shaving . She 'll hate me , he told his image in the mirror . He shook his head in dismay , sending bits of foam flying from his cheeks , and vigorously toweled off the rest of the soap . The truth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frightened he was of meeting her . He 'd agreed with his parents , Coren reminded himself , that this marriage between him and King Rayden 's daughter seemed ideal . In fact , he 'd been even more convinced than they were  --  for he 'd caught a little worrying thought of his mother 's about the wisdom of ixed marriages . It seemed that the girl 's people were afflicted with an unfortunate congenital handicap and were incapable of reading thoughts as all his countrymen could , as all normal people could  --  as he could himself . Well , that was just fine by Coren . In fact , it was the main reason he 'd accepted the idea of marrying in the first place . He hated the life of the mind and wanted nothing more than reality , pure and simple . Yes , a simple , straightforward life , that 's all he asked fpr . One where people could n't jump into your head uninvited , or where you did n't jump into their heads ninvited . Coren himself had a policy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others  --  not even the animals or insects or all the other living  | things whose mental energies buzzed continually through the minds of all Andillans . It was hard , but he had decided not to eavesdrop , and he stuck by it , and he was proud of it . What he wanted was a place where the world was real and solid , not some imagined place that existed only in your head . His parents might be content with the magnificent rooms and mansions they imagined they were living in , inside their minds . But Coren himself was just too sensible to blithely ignore the real dust and ruins that he saw all around him in Andilla , the once beautiful buildings that had been abandoned when people decided that mental dwellings were better than real ones and mental beds softer than real mattresses . In Andilla , it was either imagine a soft place to sleep or else lie on the cold real ground and suffer  --  as Coren insisted on doing . Gepeth sounded like a paradise in comparison to Andilla . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gepethians could actually change the world they lived in , simply by making whatever they imagined materialize  --  changing it in your thoughts was more than bad enough , thank you . But he was reassured when his mother reported that the people of Gepeth had all agreed on one world and stuck to it . A world with real beds in it , he hoped soft ones . " A pretty boring kind of world it is , too , if you as  | me , " his mother had added . " No dragons or anything interesting . " But that was sensible . Dragons were scary , even when you knew they were just in your thoughts . The Gepethians sounded like his kind of people . Even so , as soon as news of that girl had come into is life , everything had changed , and if there was one thing Coren was sure he did n't like , it was change . It as n't the princess 's fault , of course , but Coren had gun to think that maybe it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget about the arriage . It was making everything so complicated and annoying . To begin with , as soon as King Rayden had arrived Andilla with the marriage proposal , there had to be bargaining , endless dealing and negotiating . And , of uirse , his parents insisted Coren be in on all of it . people were passing back and forth through his mind if it were the main market square in the village . He s hardly ever left alone anymore , and he hated it . When he was left alone , it was even worse , because whenever he was by himself , strange ideas and visions d begun to pop into his head , uncontrollably . He 'd ver had peculiar thoughts like that before , never . gly white rooms filled with uncomfortable-looking ck furniture . Huge white bears with long dangerous-'king claws .

Coren began to think that he might be going crazy . And he resolved never to tell her about it , once he met her she 'd really think he was beneath her then , having thoughts like that . She 'd probably suppose he had some kind of illness . Maybe he did . Or , he thought , maybe my mind is warning me off , telling me I 'm doing the wrong thing . Why ca n't I just confront my parents and say no to this marriage ? It is n't too late . They claim to love me , do n't they ? They 'll understand and respect my feelings . I 'll do it now . I 'll walk right up to them and demand to go home . I 'll Who was he kidding ? He 'd do no such thing . He was a coward , a disgusting coward . He was doomed . Doomed . As if in response to his desolation , the mirror fogged over . He put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass . There was no moisture . And yet the mirror remained fogged . He put his whole forearm against the mirror so he could rub it clean with his arm . He could n't . It was as if he were looking at it with his eyes closed . Coren stood back a little and stared . Now what was happening ? He rubbed the mirror wildly with  | loth hands , at the same time willing his image to return . But it did n't . Instead , the mirror began to shimmer , and suddenly he saw a beautiful , no , a stunning face the face of a magnificent young woman with fair hair and blue eyes , her full lips in a sensuous pout . She was wearing a white dress , made of gossamer lace over white satin , with pink scarves trailing from the cuffs of the sleeves . She looked like the kind of lady brave knights went into battle for , fought monsters for . Then the image in the mirror wavered just a little , and changed . It was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple blue outfit . She seemed not trite so perfect , more human somehow . He liked her better this way  --  she was less imposing , less frightening . He looked at the girl with pleasure , almost forgetting that her face ought not to be in his mirror . The age seemed to flicker . It was like a reflection , as if the girl were gazing into water of some kind . Suddenly , she turned away from him and then riled back again and stared piercingly , right into his yes . Something had surprised her , something behind cr . There , behind her shoulder , he could see himself  --  a reflection of his own white face and freckles , flickering in the water . Coren was puzzled . How could he there , when he was here , in the forest ? But there was no time to think about that , he reald . There was danger there , in that scene in the mir-  | ror . The girl was being pulled , pulled into the pool by some great force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No ! Do n't go ! " he heard himself shouting . " Coren ! Coren ! " The sharp voice cut through the spell . The vision disappeared . It was his mother , Queen Milda . And for once he was glad she had intruded on his thoughts , because now he was staring into a clear unfogged mirror hung on a tree in a reassuringly solid forest glen . He could feel his heart beating , and his hands were wet . He turned around to greet his mother . She was n't there . " Of course I 'm not there , " he heard her say inside his head . " Why would I be ? You 're the one who insists on actually visiting people physically , instead of just doing the sensible thing and entering their thoughts like everybody else . You wo n't catch me wasting my time with nonsense like that . " A vision of Queen Milda 's face grew inside Coren 's mind  --  her graying hair , her high forehead and beaky nose , her aggressive eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coren , " the voice went on inside his head , " you are one of us , after all , even if you do n't like to admit it . It 's just not normal for you not to use the mental powers you were born with . Refusing to read other people 's thoughts is against nature . "  | Well , Coren had heard that before , many times . 1 low often was he going to have to listen to this lecture ? If he had to go through it one more time he would go insane . " Oh , I doubt it , " said his mother in his mind . " You 've got too much common sense . Indeed , you could do with a little less common sense , if you ask me . Anyway , my boy , " Queen Milda went on briskly , " that 's not why I 'm here . I 'm here to calm your fears . " Calm his fears ? What fears ? " You know perfectly well what I mean , Coren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big day . And is horrible journey King Rayden insisted we take will on be over . This carriage we 're in is despicable  --  I do n't believe it 's been out of the stable since your real-great-grandparents ' day . And the road is so umpy that I 'm having a hard time thinking it smooth . do n't know why we could n't have just visited Rayden his mind , like sensible people do . But I suppose we o have to take his handicap into consideration , poor How . Anyway , we arrive in Gepeth soon  --  it 's just a short distance farther until we reach the end of these crds . Why , right at this very minute , King Rayden is t there on the road in front of us , galumphing around on that horse of his with his eyes peeled for a first view of the chimneys of Gepeth . " Then her tone changed , grew more serious . " You  | should be prepared to meet her , Coren . Your future wife . I know you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His thoughts about that girl were private  --  or ought to be . This was exactly what he hated most  --  people always nosing around your thoughts , ferreting out your deepest , most embarrassing secrets . It was n't fair ! " Nonsense , " Queen Milda said complacently , " it 's perfectly fair . It 's perfectly natural . It 's the way things are , and that 's that . And anyway , there 's nothing for you to be embarrassed about . It 's absolutely normal to feel that way about a girl before you meet her . And to think those kinds of thoughts . Everyone does it , I 've been in all the young men 's minds and I know . " She knew ? She knew those thoughts , too ? He felt himself turn even more red . " And if you think you 've got thoughts to be embarrassed about , Coren , well , let me tell you ! Some of those boys ' minds could stand a trip through the laun-dry  --  with lots of bleach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to be nervous . Lenora 's bound to like you . You 're a fine young man , the cream of Andillan manhood . Oh , I suppose you could learn to unbend a little now and then , but why would she not like you ? " Look in the mirror , Coren thought to himself miserably . Luckily , his mother was too caught up in her own thoughts to hear him .  | " And you 'll like her , too , " she was saying . " She 's a real princess , Lenora is , despite her , urn , her little disability . A real princess . " Coren could feel his mother 's pride in the good match radiate through his mind , like heat from a fire . " Well , " she finally said , " I hope you feel better now that we 've had this little chat . You do , do n't you ? " There was a brief silence as Coren willed himself to think pleasant thoughts , positive thoughts  --  anything to reassure Queen Milda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he heard her say finally , " I guess that will ave to do . And I am not a nosy old snoop , mister , and o n't you forget it . And besides , I like those freckles . hey remind me of your father . " And then she was , thankfully , gone from his head . Coren sighed . Typical of his mother to invade his rivacy just to make him feel better , which always ade him feel worse . And yet , he wondered uneasily , after he settled own in Gepeth , would n't he miss her popping up like at unexpectedly , just a little bit ? When she was no longer in his mind anymore , would he want her back again ? And all the rest of them , too ? What would it be like never to have them there ? Well , what did it matter ? The girl would no doubt to him and call the marriage off the second she saw in . He sighed , then took a step forward to retrieve  | the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a tree root , and fell . " Ouch , " the tree root thought . Coren wished this horrible day was over .  | " It was a sending  --  it had to be . " After listening with rapt attention to Lenora 's report of her strange ; xperience , Lufa seemed even more solemn than she 'd cen earlier . She dipped the edge of her skirt into the ool and then bathed Lenora 's temples with cold water s she considered what it could mean . " Yes , " she explained , " a sending . A vision someone sent to you , to show you . " She paused , and then her face grew more alarmed . " It must be a moment from c future  --  your future , Lenora , or at least a possible tire , one you might choose . It 's been sent to warn you , perhaps , or to prepare you  --  so that you 'll be ready ) r it when it comes . " Ready for it ? Ready for what ? What had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sent it ? " Lufa mused . " And why did it vine to you ? The yearning in you , the discontenthoever is doing it knows you might respond . " Would she ? By now Lenora 's teeth were chattering . he felt cold all over . Never had she thought she  | could feel such joy in evil , in destruction . Was she losing control of her mind ? And yet  --  the joy , the sheer joy of it . The power . Her teeth chattered even more . Lufa caught Lenora 's hand in hers . " You can go there , Lenora , " Lufa stated with certainty . " When the moment comes , you 'll be able to go , if you wish to . It 's a real place , I 'm sure of that . And it 's clear you 're wanted there . " " But why ? What for ? " Lenora cried . Lufa looked unsure . " For your power , perhaps . " " But that 's silly . There 's nothing special about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words : " You have more power than is good for anyone ! " Perhaps her mother was right . Perhaps she was on a dangerous road . How could she enjoy all that destruction so much ? She had reveled in it . And something inside her , even now , wanted to experience it again . It was so confusing . " Never mind , child , " Lufa said in a soothing voice . " It 's only a sending . It ca n't harm you , it ca n't draw you in , not unless you want it to . All you need to do is ignore it , and then everything will be fine . " But Lenora could n't help noticing the troubled look in Lufa 's eyes . " Come on , up you get , " Lufa commanded , pulling Lenora by the hand . " A brisk walk , blood flowing  | again , you 'll be right as rain . " She handed Lenora her basket and set off at a slow trot . Lenora followed . She had to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she could feel the color returning to her cheeks . They emerged from the garden just in time to catch the glint of horses ' bridles on the road below . The king 's party was returning . Lenora was surprised  --  she had n't expected her father back from his hunting expedition for at least a few more days . As soon as Lufa saw the king 's party , her attitude changed . " Go to the kitchen and get some hot soup , " she ordered , " and you 'll be fine . And , " she added hesitantly , " my best wishes , Lenora . " Then she took the basket from Lenora and hurried toward her cottage . Actually , Lenora already felt fine . The combination of exercise and her youth had quickly dispelled the sending and its aftereffects . As she sauntered back home , the sun beating down on her and warming her even more , she vaguely wondered why Lufa had rushed away so quickly , and why she 'd wished her well . She could see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road below her . If she hurried , she could reach the stables behind the palace at the same time as he did . At least , she thought as she began to run , the afternoon is almost over , and I 've managed to keep out of trouble . She reached the stable just as her father 's party did ,  | and she ran across the stable yard to greet him as he dismounted from his horse and turned toward her . King Rayden was a thin wiry man , with fair hair and blue eyes that were never at rest . His energy was boundless . " Lenora , my dear , " he said , his voice jovial , " I 've brought someone for you to meet . You 'll never guess who . I wanted to surprise you . Your seventeenth birthday is fast approaching , and . . . " he paused . " You see , I have n't really been on a hunting trip . Well " ? he laughed , looking at his men ? " maybe I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've bagged something just for you ! " At that he strode over to a figure standing next to one of the horses , fiddling with the saddle , apparently trying to melt out of sight . " A husband ! " King Rayden proclaimed . A husband ? Did he say a husband ? Lenora stood in shocked silence as her father grabbed the figure by the shoulder and spun him around . " And this is he ! " he announced . " Lenora , dear , meet Prince Coren , son of Arno and Milda of Andilla . " Red hair , gray-blue eyes , white skin , freckles . As she stared at the prince , the blood drained from her face . It was him . It was the boy she 'd seen in the sending ! She turned with a choking soundand fled up the back stairs and into the palace .  | Coren clutched the stirrup of his horse , the only thing close enough to hold on to as his knees buckled under him . It was her . The young woman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Princess Lenora . His fiancee . The horse whinnied and moved , throwing Coren off balance . He let go of the stirrup and swayed unsteadily . King Rayden caught him under his arm . " You all right , boy ? " Coren nodded dumbly . But he was n't . He was n't the least bit all right . It was bad enough that he 'd just had that strange fantasy about her , but her reaction to his arrival was worse , far worse . A fitting end to a horrible journey . Suddenly his mother was in his head again . " Pull yourself together , Coren . Your lack of selfconfidence is astonishing . You spend altogether too much time in your own thoughts . " Then he heard her turning her attention toward his father , voicing her outrage at the girl 's rude behavior . " You 're right , Milda , " King Arno declared inside his wife 's and son 's heads . " We 're not beggars . Rayden came to us with this proposal , not the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Queen Milda huffed , " I 've never seen anything like it . Just who does she think she is ? " King Rayden let go of Coren , rushed over to Queen  | Milda in a tizzy , and tried to apologize for Lenora . " Honestly , " he protested , " I ca n't imagine what got into her . Perhaps it was the surprise . " " You did n't tell her ? " Queen Milda was so shocked that she actually spoke aloud . Her voice rang out so that all could hear . Coren realized that he 'd hardly ever heard it before  --  she never actually talked when she could just slip her way into someone 's mind . She must be furious . " Well , " King Rayden answered , shifting nervously from one foot to the next , " we thought she should meet Coren , get to know him , see what a nice harmless boy he is , and then we 'd tell her . But when I saw her just now , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistake , I suppose . She can be a bit headstrong . " Coren was so angry King Rayden had called him harmless that he almost missed the headstrong part . But his parents were eyeing King Rayden thoughtfully . " Headstrong ? He neglected to mention that before , " Coren overheard Queen Milda say inside King Arno 's mind . " Indeed , " said his father aloud . He had obviously decided the situation had gone beyond politeness , and was now shamelessly investigating King Rayden 's thoughts . " Yes , yes , " he said to King Rayden . " I see there 's a lot you never mentioned . Talking chairs , indeed . Dragons in the laundry room , humph . I see was making a mistake , being polite enough not to read what was really on your mind . "  | " Yes , " said Queen Milda , speaking aloud again , " or else we 'd have known about the Luxorian ambassador turning into a goat . " " And about the pond in the garden turning into lemonade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Coren was flabbergasted . He was engaged to a girl who turned ponds into lemonade ? So it was true . It had to be true . She did have something to do with those nightmarish visions . It had been her in that pool , after all . Was it possible ? Well , that was it . The very last straw . There was no way he was going to marry her . White bears . Pink puppies . Lemonade . Pools , dangerous pools . He would tell his parents . As soon as they were alone . Or maybe tonight . Or tomorrow , perhaps , after they got over being so angry about how King Rayden had tricked them . " Wait , " King Rayden said hastily . " Let me go after er . I 'll speak to her , and I promise that by tonight verything will be fine . " Before anybody could object , King Rayden called r servants to escort his guests to their quarters and ) ended up the stairway into the house , leaving . hind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dung prince .  | This banquet is a disaster , Lenora told herself , a complete and total disaster . Just like the rest of my day . I have to get out of here . She was sitting beside Prince Coren on the high dais in front of everybody , just as her parents had insisted , and she was being polite . Nothing more , just polite  --  but , she told herself , he was lucky to get even politeness , showing up like that out of nowhere and demanding she marry him . As if she were a piece of dry goods or something ! That 's just what she 'd said to her father . Told him he was treating her like dry goods . She trembled with anger as she remembered that horrible encounter . He 'd been so furious with her for running from Prince Coren that he 'd stormed into her room without even knocking , grabbed her arm , and told her that he 'd never seen such disgraceful behavior in his life . Well , how was she supposed to react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't even asked her about it . They gave her no more consideration than they 'd give a bolt of gabardine . No , she was n't sorry she 'd returned  | her father 's anger with her own , even though her hand still smarted from the blow she 'd given her bedroom wall . With a mixture of pride and dismay , she remembered the crater she 'd created in the plaster , not with her mind but with her fist . You could see the wood lath right through it . After that , her father had suddenly become very calm , too calm . He 'd told her she was completely out of control and that only marriage could save her from herself . " No question about it , young lady , " he 'd said , " it 's t line you grew up . And marriage will do it . Once you 're married , you 'll be too busy running a household to worry about adventure . " Furthermore , it had to be marriage to someone like ( ' Oren . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people are a little flighty , I do n't deny it . But luckily , Coren seems to have escaped the family character , even if he does share their handicap . " Handicap ? What did that mean , she wondered , ; eking a furtive glance at the frail figure seated beside her . Could all those freckles be considered a handicap ? ell , they seemed to run in the family . His father had hem , too . Anyway , King Rayden had announced that the edding  --  her wedding  --  would take place in just two weeks . And then he 'd left her there , stewing in her  | room , staring at the hole in the wall , too angry to even think , while he went to smooth things over with Prince Coren 's parents . Apparently he 'd succeeded  --  at least enough for them to agree to come to this miserable banquet and force her to sit there in front of everybody like some mindless little doll , ever so politely asking this Coren person to " please pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretending not to notice how he spent the whole time hunched over his plate , deliberately ignoring her . It was the perfect end to a perfect day . A sharp ringing noise interrupted Lenora 's thoughts . It was her father , now on his feet , tapping his wineglass with his spoon to get everybody 's attention . Oh no , please , not that ! Surely he was n't going to make a speech . He was . In a panic , Lenora spun around to see how Prince Coren was going to respond to her father 's embarrassing behavior . As she turned , he turned toward her . They were looking directly at one another . And she was n't seeing a pathetic , skinny boy who was too shy to even talk about the weather . She was seeing a strong , compassionate face , she was looking into sympathetic gray-blue eyes . She felt something , something No . She did n't . She did n't feel anything . She blinked , shook her head , and quickly turned away .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and concerned . " Are you all right ? " She had to get out of there . Murmuring the briefest ( ) f apologies , she arose from the table and dashed from the dining room as fast as her shaky legs would carry her . Once in her room , she slammed the door behind her and leaned against it , panting . Everyone was probably furious with her , all over again . Well , she was n't going to dwell on it . And she certainly was n't going to ink about him . He was n't worth the effort . There ; is n't even one hair growing on his immature face . No , she had to focus on what to do now . How to get way from Coren and from everything he represented . he perched on the edge of the small couch by the fire d stared into the flames . There was obviously only one thing to do , she cided . She would change her reality . It was her only tion , if she really wanted to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Without all ese silly confusions . But , she realized with a sinking feeling , it would n't irk . The least smidgen of an attempt to change realy , and her father would simply stop her . nfortunately , he was still more powerful than she as . Unless she could change the world so completely at he , too , would be changed ! She might make him  | into a weakling like that Coren , or even better , some harmless kind of animal or something . King Rayden the pet squirrel . And everyone except her would believe that things had always been that way . She had a brief vision of a world where everything was orderly , where she was in charge , where people cringed as she walked by , where her power was immense . No , no , that reminded her too much of the sending . That sending . He was in it  --  Prince Coren . What had he been doing there ? Could it possibly have come from him ? She dismissed the possibility , remembering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . But still why was Coren in it ? Well , Lufa had said it was from her future , or from a possible future  --  and maybe that future was beginning to happen . Because now she knew who the boy in the sending was . She had actually met him . Coren . Those eyes  --  they were very intense . She gave her head a small shake and went back to considering possible ways of changing the world . She would be rich . Everyone else would be poor , including her father , and she 'd give them food , and they 'd thank her and worship her and bow down when she passed and No , that was silly . She did n't have the strength to change everything in this world .  | But instead , maybe she could picture a different world and then throw herself into it . That way she ould n't have to change everybody else . She could just cave them behind here , happy in their boring old balanced existence , while she herself went on to better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat on a throne a beautiful palace . Ladies and gentleman of the court milled around her . A young man walked up to her , his doublet carelessly open to reveal a muscular est . He had thick wavy black hair , deep blue eyes , a sqare jaw , broad shoulders , and a very slim waist . " Your Majesty , " he crooned as he bent over her and to kiss it . " Sir knight , " she sighed , gazing at him with pleasure . But then , could it be ? His hair slowly began to tinge color  --  black slowly became brown , then red . e pure skin became spotted with freckles . The eyes came more gray than blue , and for a moment she looked into them and again was caught , despite herIf , by something , something deeper than infatuation . his was n't what she 'd planned ! It was all wrong . Her mind must be wandering to create such nonsense . lc blotted it all out and found herself once more in ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , she did n't need a handsome knight , did she ?  | She did n't need anybody else in order to be happy . She 'd live alone on an island , and she 'd hunt and fish and ride . She 'd take care of herself , and she 'd need no one . Within seconds she was there  --  standing outside a beautiful cottage , a lake glistening in the sunset , the sky turning shades of pink and purple on the horizon and a deep royal blue overhead , a basket of berries in her hand . She turned to walk into the cottage . The smell of fresh piecrust was everywhere . She opened the door , and Coren grinned at her from the kitchen as he wiped a powdery hand across his forehead , leaving ridiculous patches of white on his face and hair . " No ! " she exclaimed in astonishment . " Not you ! What are you doing here ? " " Waiting for my blackberries , " he answered , " and if you do n't hurry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , no ! " she screamed and found herself back in front of the fire . What 's going on ? she thought desperately . Why is he turning up like this in my creations ? It 's from my mind , and I do n't want him there ! Of all people in the world he 's the one I least want there ! She paused . I have to calm down , she thought . I have to think of somewhere  --  she had an idea . Fine , if he insists on being in my creation he 'll have his wish ? but I 'll control it ! I 'll control him !  | She imagined a huge castle . She was riding a beautiful black mare up to the castle gates . Situated just on her right was a small hut with bars on the windows and a guard at the door . She glanced over . Coren looked at her through the bars . She laughed in delight . " There ! " she cried aloud to him in triumph . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least put you where you belong . How does it feel to be a prisoner ? " But to her dismay , he answered her . She had n't planned for him to answer her . " I hate it , " he groaned . " Please let me go . " And he looked at her with those compelling eyes , and she felt sorry for him . She did n't want to feel sorry for him . She wanted im out of her thoughts . Abruptly the prison was gone , and the horse and e castle , too . But those eyes were still there , those ep blue eyes . She was imprisoned by those eyes . He as her jailer . Why could n't she stop thinking about that idiot ? e had to escape from him . Escape . As she thought the word , wishing for lease , she suddenly saw the pool and heard voices chanting . She was back in the sending , being pulled , ing drawn to a beautiful vision of great joy and great power , paradise -- Then , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by c fire . Alone .  | She sighed and sank onto the couch . She did n't like that vision . Or rather , she was confused by it . It disturbed her that it had , once more , come into her head unbidden . And it was enticing , it tantalized her . She wanted it , and she did n't want it . But she had no time to think about that vision now . She had to get away . And she had an idea  --  real escape , using her own two legs . She would run away . And she would do it now , tonight , before anyone expected it , before they could stop her . She 'd run away to a different land where people lived in different ways . She 'd get as far away from Coren and marriage as possible . Quickly she moved around the room , preparing her escape . It had to be right . It had to be all real  --  nothing imagined , nothing created . She rummaged through the closet , choosing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black leather jerkin . She also put on her riding boots and a peaked cap . In a small bag she packed clean underclothes , two dresses , a pair of shoes , and an extra sweater  --  and , as an afterthought , all her gold jewelry . She knew she should feel some regret at leaving her parents and for the worry she would cause them , but she felt none . She only wanted to be away from the stifling life they had planned for her . And away from Prince Coren . Why had he entered her worlds like that , spoiling her creations ? Well , she thought , at least he 'd never know about it ,  | at least she 'd be spared that embarrassment . The palace seemed quiet . She put on her cap and moved to her door , tiptoeing on the balls of her feet so that her boot heels would n't click on the tiled floor .  | Loren stared glumly into the fire , hardly conscious of the wonderfully soft bed he was sitting on . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing . At supper , for a moment , when their eyes had met , he thought Princess Lenora might actually be feeling something for him . He 'd seen  --  something in her eyes . But then she 'd shut him out and bolted from the room , just as if she were frightened of him . Frightened of him , of all things . It was only fair . He was frightened of her , too . She was a frightening person . That vision he had somehow picked up before they actually met it must have been some nightmarish fantasy she had invented of herself staring into a pool . Well , it only made sense to be frightened of somebody who could imagine something as strange as that . Yet , when he 'd looked into her eyes , he 'd felt such a rush of emotion he could barely contain it . Was this love ? Surely not . He could n't love her . And she could n't possibly love him .  | Not that he 'd know if she did . He prided himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to enter her thoughts uninvited . That was impolite , no matter hoot his mother and father said . And who knows what embarrassing thoughts about himself he might over-hear . He had managed fairly well , too until she had let him in of her own accord . But it was a brief encounter , to short for him to do more than sense something , something Something unexpected . Something he did n't understand . Whatever it was , her sudden flight from the banquet had caused such a commotion that he had n't had any time to think about it . What with his mother chattering wildly away inside his father 's mind and his own bout how erratic Lenora was , and Queen Savet blushing in embarrassment and doing her best to pretend nothing unusual had happened , and King Rayden trying to reassure everybody by telling bad jokes and laughing too loud  --  well , in all that tumult it was impossible to think about anything . The commotion had brought the banquet to an immediate halt . Now that he was back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes . He could see them clearly in his mind , test as if she were actually there . Those eyes were shinning under the elaborate jeweled crown she wore on her  | head . She was a queen . She sat at a throne in a beautiful palace . Ladies and gentlemen of the court milled around her . Without even willing it , Coren found himself walking up to her , bending over her hand to kiss it , then looking up to see the furious look on her face just as it disappeared from view and he found himself staring into the fire again . Wait a minute . What was happening ? Before Coren could even begin to think about it , he realized that he was looking at Lenora again . She was right there , in front of him , and he was grinning at her , and he was in the middle of baking a pie . But I do n't know how to bake a pie , he told himself hysterically . How much flour should I use ? But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking a pie , after all . He was staring into a fire , suddenly back in his bedroom . Coren took a deep breath and willed himself not to panic . Then he tried to understand what was happening to him . He sent his mind out searching and quickly found the explanation . Lenora was in her own room , and she was thinking about him  --  and every time she did , he was a captive in her head , thinking her thoughts , living her fantasies . He was being dragged into her mind completely against his will . Why ? Why was it happening ? He lay there on the bed , desperately trying to resist the pull of her mind . But he could n't . He was being  | caught , trapped again and again , unable to do anything but watch helplessly as he became the leading character in all her schemes to escape . And she did n't seem to like it any more than he did  --  now she had him in some kind of smelly prison , and the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars was dangerous indeed . He grabbed on to the cold iron bars and tried to reason with her , to calm her down . It did n't work , t hough . She was furious with him . She was shouting at him angrily  --  something about being a jailer , some-t king about escape . And then , suddenly , his hands were gripping nothing . The bars had disappeared , and the prison and Lenora with them . He was back on the bed again . Released from prison . Released from the prison of Lenora 's thoughts . He lay there for some time , his heart pounding , waiting . Any minute now it would happen again , he thought , but it did n't . This time , it seemed , she was gone , really gone . Coren stood up , still shaking , still certain that at any moment he might be pulled away again . He could n't stand it . He had to know . He sent his thoughts out again , searching for Lenora . There she was , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes now , not about him . Good . For a while , at least , he was safe . This is ridiculous , he told himself . She thinks of me  | as her jailer , and meanwhile she 's imprisoning me in her thoughts . I do n't want to be her jailer . I definitely do n't want to be jailed by her . I do n't want anything but to get out of this place and go home and forget about her altogether . I 'll tell her , he said to himself . Not inside her head , she 'll think I 'm just a fantasy again . No , I 'll go to her in person . I 'll let her know that she can escape anytime she wants to , that it 's just fine by me , that I do n't want to marry her any more than she wants to marry me . And then maybe she 'll stop pulling me into her head this way . And before he could talk himself out of it , he got up from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkened corridor . The passageway was empty . Slowly Lenora moved through the corridor to the stairs , which were lit by small candles placed in holders on the walls . She was almost free . And then there was a terrible crash , and a scream . Lenora froze . Doors opened all along the hall , and within seconds , worried servants with candles hovered around her , seeking the source of the loud noise . Moments later her father strode into view , took in her traveling clothes with one quick glance , and demanded , " Lenora , what is the meaning of this ? " " Sire , " a breathless young servant interrupted . " The  | noise it was Prince Coren . He tripped on the landing and crashed into the queen 's blue vase . He sends his sincere apologies . " Coren . Again . Lenora 's shoulders sagged . She had been caught and it was all that miserable boy 's fault . What a clumsy oaf he was . And what was he doing skulking through the corridors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenora , " her father said quietly , " please return to your room . And prepare . The ceremony will take place tomorrow morning . " Then he turned to the servants . " I want no talk of this little indiscretion to our visitors , " he ordered . " They are not to know . " The servants nodded and dispersed , all except two of King Rayden 's most trusted men . They escorted Lenora back to her room and placed themselves on either side of the door in the corridor . She was a prisoner now . Despairing , Lenora went into her room and threw herself on her bed . Changing this world was impossible . Creating another one was worse . And escape was out . She was trapped .  | I 'm an idiot , Coren berated himself , a complete idiot . Useless even at walking around in the dark . No wonder she wants to get away from me . And she did , more than ever . Now that he was back in his room , he was being drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron filings by a magnet . He had no choice but to eavesdrop as she told herself how furious she was with the hateful villain who stopped her escape . Him , she meant . He shut his eyes . What should he do ? Just refuse to marry her ? She obviously was n't what he wanted in a wife just the opposite , in fact . Life with someone as headstrong and imaginative as Lenora certainly was n't going to be the safe , solid existence he 'd hoped for ? not when she could change it all at any moment , transform it into every sort of nightmarish horror . Once more the memory of that vision in the mirror passed through his mind , and he shivered . And yet , this was astonishing , he found part of himself somehow not wanting to give it all up not Gepeth , not even Lenora . Part of him found it all  | exhilarating  --  in a nerve-racking sort of way . And , yes , he also had to admit that he wanted to see Lenora again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way she pulled him to her , but it was wonderul at the same time . The intensity of her thoughts , the rich texture of them . It was definitely better than any fantasy book he 'd ever read . On the other hand , she wanted nothing to do with him . She hated him . Of course she did , he 'd given her no reason not to . He sighed . Best just to refuse the marriage , for her sake if not for his own . His eyes were finally growing heavy . He was free of her mind now , back in his own dull , safe thoughts ? perhaps she 'd finally managed to fall asleep . He sank hack onto the thick down comforter . It felt marvelous , especially since for once in his life he was n't tempted to think a rough , threadbare blanket into something softer and warmer . A pity to give solid luxuries like this up , really . But the marriage was impossible . She was n't for him , and that was t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and fell asleep . " Time to get up , Miss Lenora , " Marlia said , drawing hack the covers . " Your bath is ready and your mother is on her way to talk to you . " I wonder , thought Lenora as she yawned and stretched , what Prince Coren really thinks about ; ill this . I suppose he always does just what  | Mommy and Daddy tell him to do . Well , she thought defiantly , they 'll be sorry in the end , because this stupid marriage wo n't last long . I ca n't run away from here , maybe but I can run away from Coren after we 're married . He ca n't keep me a prisoner in my own home , he would n't have the strength . That thought cheered her a little . Just then Lenora 's mother swept into the room . She had a small frown on her face . She looked at Lenora , then away . " What is it , Mother ? " Lenora said , knowing Queen Savet well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the small couch , gesturing for Lenora to sit beside her . " Give her a shawl , Marlia , " the queen ordered as Lenora obeyed and sat beside her . " Do you want her to catch a chill ? " Her voice was shrill . It was warm in the room , and Lenora was perfectly comfortable in her cotton nightshirt , but she allowed Marlia to place a heavy wool shawl over her shoulders . Her mother took her hand . " Lenora , you worried your father terribly when you tried to run away . It 's a dangerous world outside of Gepeth . You have no idea your life has been so safe , so secure . " She paused . Lenora did n't speak . She wanted to say , yes , too safe , too secure , but she refrained . She sensed her  | mother was working up to saying something important and probably unpleasant . " Lenora , there 's something I have to tell you . " She sighed , then spoke quickly . " As part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island of Crosnor , and his parents have agreed that you both will live there until after your second child is born . At that point , you 'll return to the mainland and take up Prince Coren 's lands and holdings . The boats , which are the only transportation to and from the island , will be under constant guard by your father 's own men . And " Her mother hesitated , apparently unwilling to tell her something even worse . " And there will be a brigade posted on the mainland , using its mental power to hold you there . " A whole brigade ? Outrageous . Well , that was the last straw . Abruptly , Lenora withdrew her hand from her mother 's . " I have to take my bath , " she stated flatly . And without so much as another glance at her mother she got up and marched from the room . " Wake up , " King Arno shouted as he pulled the prince out of a deep sleep , his voice rumbling through Coren 's mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news was no surprise to Coren he had all too clear memories of the colorful , enraged  | thoughts he 'd been forced to overhear in Lenora 's mind after that ugly blue vase had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and King Rayden had discovered his daughter in the corridor and made his decision about moving up the ceremony . But Coren was n't going to go through with it no matter how much his parents insisted on it , and that was that . Because , he told himself , they would insist on it . It was a good political move , good for both countries . Furthermore , King Rayden had misread Coren 's parents if he 'd thought they 'd be put off by Lenora 's childhood escapades . Once they got over the shock of being lied to like that , they were bound to see her as an even better match  --  she was even crazier than they were themselves , if that was possible . Oh yes , now that they knew about the talking chairs and all , they were going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his father surprised him . " The young lady is n't at all what we were led to believe , " King Arno said . " She 's headstrong and imaginative . I 'd expected her to be boring , like everyone else here . And she certainly is n't boring . " No , Coren thought ruefully , she certainly is n't bor-ing . " No , she is n't , " his father agreed . " And that 's just it , is n't it ? Your mother and I felt , well , we felt that someone boring would suit you just fine . That 's what we thought , is n't it , Milda ? "  | " Yes . " He could see his mother 's face beside his father 's in his mind , nodding in agreement . " So , " his father continued , " the question is , will the Princess Lenora suit you ? Well , Coren , we 've decided we wo n't force you . " " It 's up to you , " his mother added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was free . His parents were n't going to force him to marry this upsetting girl after all , and he did n't even have to defy them about it . So he opened his mouth to reply and said , " I 'll marry her . " It was more of a shock to himself than it was to his parents . He must have lost his mind . His parents , though , were delighted . So delighted , in fact , that they hurried away before he could reverse his decision , leaving him with no choice but to go through with it . And , he added to himself as he put on the strange and very uncomfortable suit that King Rayden had sent for him to wear at the ceremony , I hope Lenora does n't hate me for it too much . I hope I do n't hate me for it too much . But he could n't picture leaving her , despite the merry dance he 'd been led ever since he 'd first heard of her , despite the strange time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tormented dreams he 'd just been  | experiencing . Nightmares about that pool , about water rippling , about terrible danger . Was Lenora in danger ? Was he ? He hoped not . He was n't ready for danger . And yet he felt that they were somehow tied together , he and Lenora . It was n't love , of course , nothing like that . But there was something there , something pulling him to her . And he could n't , apparently , resist not even if he wanted to . And so , somewhat bewildered , Coren soon found himself standing by the altar , clothed in an uncomfortable garment of powder blue that revealed all too clearly how ridiculously skinny his legs were , awaiting his marriage . Lenora was feeling numb rather than angry . It was all over , then . Any chance of escape gone . And if she and Coren had children , she would n't be able to leave them . That 's what her father was counting on , and he was probably right . She allowed herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as in a dream , a dream happening to someone else . Finally , she was led downstairs by Marlia and her mother 's other servants , to wait for the carriage that would take her to the chapel in the village . " You look lovely , miss , " Marlia whispered to her as she descended the stairs . Lenora looked at herself in the full-length mirror on the landing . She did look nice , she thought , as  | though commenting on a stranger . Her hair was threaded with gold braid . A gold necklace at her throat just touched the white lace of her gown . The gown her mother had given her to wear was the one she herself had been married in . It was low at the neck , tucked in under the breasts , flowing at the ground , delicate lace , patterned over silk . Interwoven in the lace was gleaming gold thread , which brought out the gleam of her hair . It was almost as beautiful as the dresses she 'd imagined for herself . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the chapel in the village . He smiled with delight when he saw how lovely she looked . She put her hand on his arm , mechanically , and did n't acknowledge him . He patted her hand . " I know you , " he soothed . " You feel you hate me now , but this is for the best . You 'll see . And I promise to be the most doting of grandfathers . " She did n't respond , she could n't . She could n't allow herself to get angry , it made everything too difficult . She knew she had to remain numb and unfeeling or she would n't survive the day . The choir began to sing , the organ to play . The heavy wooden doors opened . Slowly , she and her father moved down the aisle of the chapel . She 'd seen it so many times before , but never had she understood it like this . The long central aisle  --  perfect for a father to  | march his daughter down against her will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people of the court , hastily gathered to witness her humiliation and make sure she could n't escape . Down at the end of the aisle , Agneth , the Keeper of the Balance , who put her to sleep with his boring and endless sermons week after weary week and who was about to imprison her in the balance forever . And there , behind Agneth , the stone basin filled with water , resting on a thick stone base . How many times had she watched her many cousins marry and heard Agneth repeat that the water signified the purity of their vows , and how , like water , they must in marriage be willing to join different paths into one path , adapt , be fluid  --  keep the bal-ance . As Lenora walked past the front row , she noted in passing that her future in-laws were dressed in peculiar , tattered clothes . Her mother gave her a warm encouraging smile . Lenora stared right through her . Prince Coren was waiting at the altar , standing in front of Agneth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powder blue one in the most current of Gepethian styles . He really looked quite good in it , too , despite his skinny legs . Not that she cared , of course . Her father took her hand from his arm and placed it firmly on Prince Coren 's . The prince glanced at her  | and then quickly turned to Agneth , who had already begun the ceremony . The Keeper droned on and on , for what seemed to Lenora to be an eternity . Finally , he came to the water sanctification . " Move forward , my children , " said Agneth , " and observe your future . " Without even thinking about it , Lenora moved up to the basin and peered in . She saw her own reflec-tion  --  and there , behind it , Coren 's face , rippling in the water . Suddenly she snapped out of her lassitude . It was her vision . This was the moment of the sending ! The water swirled . She heard a voice . She was being called , beckoned . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hear anything , she was sure of it . But she could feel the water , the vision pulling her . And she wanted to go . After all , what could be worse than this ? What ? A little piece of her mind protested and said , Wait , not this , if you wish to flee , create something of your own , this is n't yours , you do n't know what it is . But , she thought , I ca n't create my own , I 've tried , someone is offering me something and it 's my chance to escape . I just have to say yes . She could feel Coren 's hand on her arm . " No , " she heard him say . " No , do n't do it ! "  | " I will , " she cried . " I have to ! " And with that she threw her mind into the sending , and her body followed . She could hear Coren calling . Then she was no longer in the chapel , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock looking over an endless sea . And Coren was sitting next to her .  | Are you mad ? " she screamed at him . " Why did you follow me ? I jumped into this just to get away from you ! " Lenora turned away from Coren in fury and looked out over the unfamiliar landscape below them . The hill they were perched on was the only elevated land for as far as she could see in any direction . On one side of the hill , far below , was the sea , stretching off into the gray distance , but the other side was totally different . At the end of an absolutely straight road that ran like a ribbon across a flat , open plain , a city arose , gleaming and shimmering , tall white spires shooting up into the low clouds , a city like nothing she 'd seen before . " It 's beautiful  --  so beautiful , " she said , her eyes soaking in the grandeur of the towers . Then her glance fell on Coren again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful it is , " she announced . " You 've spoiled it . I leap into another world , and you just chase after me like some mindless puppy . Well , it 's no good with you here , no good at all .  | I 'm going home right now , and you 're coming with me whether you like it or not . And I 'm putting my foot down . I do n't care what they say , I will not marry ! Not you or anybody ! They ca n't make me , they ca n't , they ca n't , they ca n't ! And then ? " her eyes wandered back to the white towers ? " maybe I 'll come back here again . On my own . " She grabbed Coren 's hand before he could object , closed her eyes , willed the picture of her home into her mind , and leaped . A gray wall seemed to crash down around her , preventing any movement . She was still there , still standing on that hill and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked in a shaky voice . " There we were in the . . . and then . . . I do n't under-stand . " His words turned into a weak whimper . What a bumbling idiot he was ! She had to get the poor scared creature out of here . She closed her eyes and tried once more . Again , she experienced her body and spirit being slammed into a fixed grayness which held her . Her powers were n't working . They had always worked before . " This is ridiculous , " she protested . " I want to go home , and I 'm going . " Again she tried , this time slowly and carefully creating a detailed image in her mind of her parents , the chapel , the pool she had moved through . It was there , it was almost  | Wham ! She dropped Coren 's hand , staggered back , and sank to the ground . " I  --  I ca n't do it . I ca n't leave . " Coren stared down at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Lenora actually seemed frightened . She needed his help . " Are  --  are you all right ? " He tentatively reached out to touch her . But before he could , she looked up at him with fury in her eyes . " All right ? All right ? Of course I 'm not all right . " She pulled herself to her feet and paced back and forth over the rocky ground as she hissed angry words at him . " My powers are n't working . We 're stuck here ! I 'm stuck here  --  with you ! " Well , Coren thought ruefully , at least she was back to herself again . He could stop worrying about her being frightened and go back to being frightened him-self . " Stuck where ? " he asked , looking anxiously out over the strange landscape . " Where are we ? " She turned and glared into his face . " Where are we indeed ! You might well ask ! " Then her eyes lost their fire . " I do n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly walked away from him , her shoulders slumped . " You do n't know ? "  | " That 's right . I do n't know . It was n't my vision . I was so desperate I just leaped into what I saw in the pool . " Coren was astonished . She just leaped , without looking first ? " That was pretty foolish , " he blurted out . " Foolish ! " Lenora blazed . " And just what choice did I have ? Stand there and get forced into marriage ? " She was right . What could he have been thinking , agreeing to go ahead with it ? And now look what had happened ! " But I do n't understand , " he said . " Why ca n't we go back ? " " I do n't know , " Lenora replied , her voice anxious . " I try , but I keep hitting some kind of wall . " " Then we 're prisoners here ? " Coren said , horrified . Lenora glared at him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes narrowed . " Just what are you doing here anyway ? " " I  --  well , I sensed danger . I did n't want you to get hurt . I tried to stop you . I tried to pull you back . " He sighed . " Instead , you pulled me along  --  or at least , I think you did . " He looked at her in admiration . " You 're far stronger than I am , obviously . " Lenora gave him a withering look . " You were trying to save me ! You , the knight in shining armor , rescuing me , the poor little damsel in distress . How sweet ! "  | " I tried at least , " Coren exclaimed . " There 's no need to make fun of me . I just tried to help . " " Do n't you see ? " Lenora snapped . " I did n't want your help ! " " Yes , " Coren grimaced . " I can see that now . It was stupid of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really stupid . She did n't want his help . She did n't want anything to do with him . What had he been thinking of ? Still , he thought , there must be something I can do . If I can just keep calm and think it through . Because if we could figure out where we are , then we could maybe He had an idea . " Princess , " he asked Lenora , " do you recognize this place ? Is it one of your creations ? " " I 've told you already , " she exploded , exasperated . " No . Of course not . " " But think about it . How can you be sure ? Maybe it 's something from a dream , or something you are n't aware of , something from some hidden part of your mind ? " " That 's ridiculous , " she said . Well , maybe so , Coren told himself , but if she was n't aware of it , well , then of course she would n't know about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , and now was n't the time to be squeamish . He sent his mind out to hers . He heard nothing . It was as if Lenora were n't even there .  | And then , as if that were n't enough , he realized that the silence was everywhere . He could hear nothing at all  --  not even the rocks he and Lenora sat on or the feeble weeds at his feet . He had never before been so completely and utterly alone . It was what he 'd always wanted , what he 'd hoped and wished for . He 'd had no idea it would hurt so much . He sagged forward , holding his head in his hands in terrible agony . " Prince Coren , " Lenora said anxiously , " what is it ? " Well , he might as well tell her . His one strength , the one thing he had to offer , was gone . " You see , I  --  well , I was trying to hear your thoughts , enter your mind . " Lenora gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You  --  you did n't know ? " Why had n't they told her ? " We Andillans can hear one another 's thoughts . It 's an ability we 're all born with , just like the way you people of Gepeth can imagine things into reality . " " You  --  you mean you ca n't imagine things and make them real ? " " No . Oh , of course , my people do imagine the places they live in , just as yours do . But the places we imagine have no real physical substance  --  they exist only in our thoughts . " This must be the handicap her father had spoken of , Lenora mused . How odd . To imagine things and yet  | still know that what you 're imagining is n't really there . Still , the Andillans could hear others ' thoughts . Now that would be an interesting gift to have , you could find out what other people were thinking about you , you could know all their private fears and worries and Suddenly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowing dangerously . Some of the thoughts she 'd been having about Coren , about herself and him , had just passed through her mind . " How dare you enter my private thoughts ? " she said . " I wo n't stand for it ! In fact , I refuse to be near you . I 'll go somewhere where you ca n't hear me . Goodbye and good riddance ! " And with that , she lifted the train of her gown up off the ground and began to stride purposefully down the hill . No , no , thought Coren in a panic , she ca n't leave me , here , alone . Not even the air is talking ! She ca n't ! He quickly rose to his feet and shouted after her . " Lenora , " he called . " Wait , wait . " " Stay away ! " she called over her shoulder . " Stay away from me ! I 'm not having some sneaky spy in my brain and that 's that . " " Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " I ca n't hear anything now . " " What ? " She quickly stopped and turned to stare at him . " I only tried to enter your thoughts to see if this  | place has something to do with a part of your mind that you are n't conscious of but I could n't hear a thing . Not even the air . " He slumped down again . " My ability seems to have left me . " Lenora drew in a deep breath and started to move back toward him . She was about to scold him , but when she looked at his sagging shoulders she felt only pity . She could help the poor fellow out , maybe . She could use her own gift to imagine his gift back for him . Except , of course , she 'd make it so that he could read everyone 's thoughts but hers . She shut her eyes and imagined him with his powers back . " Well , " she said , opening her eyes . " Can you hear anything now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said miserably . And then she remembered that gray wall . She obviously had lost her own ability , just like him . She had to find out why and the answer was bound to be below , in that city . And , she supposed , looking into his forlorn face , she had better take the poor fellow with her . It seemed he was incapable of looking after himself . " I 'm sorry you 're upset , " she said . " I really am . But we ca n't just sit around and mope that wo n't change anything . " She pointed and began to move down the hill toward the city . " I 'm heading off there , to find out what I can find out . Are you coming or not ? " This list was flung over her shoulders .  | For a brief moment , Coren could n't decide . How could she just go tramping off like that into unknown rritory ? Someone or something had brought them here  --  someone or something unknown , someone or something with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Had she no prudence at all ? " I 'm coming , " he called miserably . " Wait for me ! "  | Lenora 's spirits were beginning to lift dramatically . The view from the hill was lovely  --  the clouds were breaking up , leaving the sky a bright blue . The vast plain below rippled green in the breeze , and the towers gleamed off in the distance . And , she realized , there were no parents to tell her what to do , she did n't have to get married , anything might happen in this strange new place . It would be perfect if it were n't for the minor annoyance of Prince Coren following her around like a puppy . What was taking him so long anyway ? Yes , she was beginning to feel quite wonderful . She tramped down the hill , deliberately kicking her delicate white wedding slippers in the dirty gravel to get them as soiled as possible . Suddenly she stopped dead in her tracks . All around her , on the hill , people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done . Hundreds of people . Or were they people ? Lenora looked in astonishment at all the new arrivals . Yes , some were people , people of all ages ,  | dressed in very different costumes , but if clothing cant anything , then they seemed to have one thing common . None was poor . Their garments were ade of silks , satins , and velvets ; and although the esigns differed , the quality did not . She could see they ere , like her and Coren , from wealthy houses . But as for the others  --  well , it was hard for her to tell what they were . Some looked vaguely human , except that the heads emerging from their opulent garments were huge and bald , and their skin was astonishing shades of rust and lemon and mauve . Others had delicate gauzy wings sprouting from their shoulders and were apparently wearing nothing at all . Others looked like lizards , with iridescent scales glinting in the light . Still others were short and stocky and had two or more heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of vapor with lights twinkling in them , which may have been living creatures and may have been only clouds of swamp gas . Before Lenora could even register her astonishment at this very odd crowd , it changed . In the blink of an eye , the gauzy vapors and shiny lizards and two-headed monsters disappeared , leaving only people  --  recognizable human beings wearing fine garments , looking for all the world as if they had gathered for a banquet or some other regal occasion . Lenora began to doubt that she had actually seen the other creatures . Might it have been just her imagination ?  | She quickly glanced back at Coren , wondering if he had seen them , too . He was still sitting on top of the hill  --  had n't even managed to make it to his feet yet . As she turned back , she could see the new arrivals standing for a moment , apparently too stunned to move . Then , almost as one , they began to walk toward the road that intersected the plain below . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further , and cursing its bulk , she fell in with the others hurrying toward the road . Meanwhile , Coren sat on top of the hill , staring out at the strange conglomeration of people , his mind racing . Why had all those monsters blinked out , just as suddenly as the whole throng had appeared ? Why had the throng appeared in the first place ? And why could- n't he enter their minds and find out ? But there was no time to think about it . Lenora was already well ahead of him , totally unconcerned as to whether he was following or not . He scrambled to his feet and began to run after her . On the very first step , one of his feet crossed over the other and pulled him sideways into an uncontrollable spin . He tumbled a surprising distance down the hill before he came to a stop with a painful dive int o the dirt . What was wrong ? he wondered . Being clumsy was one thing  --  he was used to being clumsy  --  but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back  | e as he tried to think and gave himself a sharp jab in the middle of the back . So it was n't just his feet . He brought his hand forrd to see if he could touch his finger to his nose and ked himself in the right eye . Panicked and in pain , he got up onto his feet and nged toward Lenora , who was nearing the bottom of the hill . This time , his feet did n't even bother to leave the ground . Before he knew it , he was doing a kind of sideways somersault . He rolled down the hill , picking p speed as he went , and he did n't stop until he rashed with a resounding thwack into an object large ( ) ugh to halt him . Unfortunately , that object was Lenora . The two of em fell in a big messy tangle of arms and legs , dust ying everywhere . " You idiot ! " Lenora screamed , beating and kicking t him . " You clumsy oaf ! Honestly ! Get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hopelessly caught in the folds of her gown , and the more he struggled , the more ensnared he became . " I wish I knew what the matter was , " he screamed , " I really do . Ouch ! Ouch ! Stop it , stop it ! " He reached out to push her off and jabbed her in the stomach . Ouch  --  this is the last straw , Lenora told herself . She closed her eyes , still biffing away at Coren , and thought , hard . She would imagine him away from her ,  | she would get him off her one way or another . Nothing . Nothing changed . " Blast ! " she exploded . " I ca n't do it ! I want my powers back ! " " Of course , " Coren exclaimed , still desperately trying to ward off her blows and disentangle himself from all that white lace and gauze . " It 's my powers . I ca n't hear the ground , or the trees , or the rocks , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling and hearing everything around me . " " Well , learn ! " Lenora ordered as she finally managed to pull her gown away from him , so violently that it ripped . " I do n't have my powers either , " she said , impatiently ripping off the piece of fabric that had come loose and tossing it behind her . " But you do n't see me becoming a helpless ninny . " Coren could have shriveled up and disappeared right then and there . But he did n't have much time too feel sorry for himself , because floating down the road , skimming just above its smooth white surface , was long sleek silver object . A gasp rose up from the crowd approaching t i t road , and Coren scrambled up , swaying dangerously , to get a better look at it . " Get out of the way , I ca n't see , " Lenora snapped she pushed him and he tumbled over again . Lenora watched with delight as the vehicle came  | silent stop , hovered for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sighed the crowd , and she along all them . It was like a giant silver cylinder , smooth and gleaming in the sun . A silver door in its side slid silently open and a man jumped out . He was dressed all in red : high red leather boots , red leather pants , a red leather jerkin , and a red helmet . He had an incredibly handsome face , dark and craggy  --  handsome enough to go with the broad shoulders and thin waist emphaized by the cut of his outfit . " Welcome to the country of Grag ! " the striking fellow said with a bow . " Our leader Hevak welcomes you Ill ! And if everyone would care to climb into this transport , it will be my privilege to take you to our city , many-towered Farren . This way , please . " Without a moment of hesitation , Lenora hurried to the door of the transport  --  was that what he 'd called it ? Without pausing or even speaking to one another , the rest of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully tottered behind Lenora , not wanting to go , but definitely not wanting to be left there alone . Three small steps d into the transport , and inside , there was seating for t least a hundred . Lenora raced for a place by the window . Coren pulled himself along by the seat-tops , rushing to make sure he sat beside her . She did n't evenlook at him as he plopped down next to her . For that matter , none of the people were looking at  | one another . None of them were talking to one another . It was as if they were mesmerized , each in their own private world of awe and admiration . They all shared Lenora 's dreamy look of total delight . Well , Coren thought , it 's nice enough , I suppose . The seats were soft , softer than any he had ever imagined . He ought to be enjoying it , but instead he was nervous . Everything was so strange . Where were they ? How had they gotten here , really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coren could feel it lift off the ground and then pick up speed . " This is amazing , is n't it ? " Lenora said , eyes glowing . " Finally some adventure , some excitement ! Finally ! " She could hardly contain herself . Well , at least she was talking again , Coren thought . And the rest were beginning to talk too . They were a motley crew . Looking around the transport , Coren could see every kind of style in clothes and hair . There were long braids , elaborate curls , shaved heads , ringlets , even wigs  --  worn by both women and men alike . Some of the women were dressed in elegant riding breeches of soft suede , sonic elaborate lace gowns , some simple dresses . The men had on everything from skimpy tights under long jack ? ets to baggy pants with shirts hanging out or even weird little skirts with socks pulled up to their knees . Coren was glad he did n't have to wear that ! His  | skinny legs would look awful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own costume , a pair f tight blue pants and an elaborate and very stiff blue jacket with blue trim over a cream-colored , lacetrimmed shirt . When King Rayden had brought it to him , he 'd been astonished at its sumptuous elegance , tit now , compared to the others , it seemed almost plain  --  not to mention very dusty . He tried to listen in on the conversations around ban . " Yes , indeed , every time I washed my face , " he heard the person behind him say , " every time for a week , I saw the same place in the mirror  --  this place here , as it turned out . I knew I 'd end up here soon , it was just a foretelling , as usual , the kind of thing that happens to everybody every day , correct ? I 've so been looking forward to it actually happening , and now it has ! " Then the tone of the voice changed . " It 's strange , though  --  since arriving here , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always feel what was about to happen , of course , just like everybody else . And now I feel nothing . It 's gone ! " Coren turned to stare at the speaker . She was a middle-aged woman , elegantly dressed in a long black velvet gown with a neckline so low that Coren blushed and turned away immediately . Across the aisle from him sat an older man dressed in what looked like a long gown , covered in silver  | sequins . He was muttering to himself , but he looked fairly harmless . " Excuse me , sir , " Coren heard himself saying , " do you mind if I ask how you got here ? Do you know where we are ? " " I am here because I am needed , " he replied haughtily . " And I am needed because I am knowledgeable , powerful , special . " This man may have been all those things , but he certainly was n't modest ! " But sir , how did you get here ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . " But it has something to do with me being special , I know that for sure . And , of course , I wanted a little adventure . " The confused look left him then , and he gazed in wonderment at the scene surrounding him . " And now I have it ! What a device this transport is ! What a wondrous world ! What an adventure this will be ! Still , something feels odd , I 've been trying to place it ? " He shook his head . Coren said nothing . " Oh ! " he exclaimed . " I know ! I have n't composed a poem since we 've arrived ! That 's it . In our land , you see , " he said , leaning forward confidentially across the aisle toward Coren , " in our land we compose a poem for every occasion , for every event , for every moment . For instance , my famous words on the birth of King  | Jaffray , celebrated throughout the entire land as poem of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 muse ? ' Well , I ca n't exactly remember it right now . In fact , I ca n't remember any of my poems  --  or compose any new ones either . When it comes to verse , my mind is blank ! flow strange . " And he shook his head again and seemed to lose himself in bewildered thought . So , Coren realized , it was n't just he and Lenora who had lost their powers . That woman with the embarrassing gown , this poetry man  --  perhaps everyone on the transport had powers that were now blocked for some reason . And yes , there was at least one other a fellow seated farther up the transport in a one-piece , skintight costume . Coren 's eyes were drawn to him because he suddenly thrust his arms into the air . He was shouting , " Grow , darn you ! Why are n't you growing ? It 's not natural for arms to always stay the same size . Grow ! " This was getting stranger and stranger by the minute . Coren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to tell her about his discovery . All she did was shake him off . " Look at it ! " she sighed , leaning forward toward the city that was now fast approaching them . " Is n't it mag-nificent ? "  | Lenora peered out the window , enthralled by the long rows of small dwellings that began to line the streets as they entered the city . The walls of the dwellings were made of bricks of a smooth shiny material and seemed to come in all colors  --  bright reds , yellows , blues , greens , as cheerful as a child 's painting . They were surrounded by elaborate gardens and bushes , exotic plants , and trees hung with vines . It looked like a wonderful place to live , and the people Lenora watched through the window of the transport seemed to think so , too . Small groups of men and women stood in the streets , smiling as they chatted happily with one another , and laughing children were playing tag or skipping rope on the grounds in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine . They all seemed to enjoy one another 's company so much . Nobody looked lonely or unhappy . Nobody looked out of place . Nobody looked unhealthy or ugly . Nobody even looked very old . The buildings grew in size as their journey cont ued , and Lenora concluded they must be approaching  | the center of the city . She had to twist her neck to see the tops of some of the buildings  --  which she assumed ere the same towers she 'd first seen from the hilltop . They were as magnificent up close as they 'd been from afar , covered in ornate statues and balustrades and olden decorations that glinted in the sun . The people ho lived here had taste , she decided , there was no question about that . Finally , the transport rolled into a large square , hovered , and stopped , and the doors slid silently open . eLnora clambered over Coren in her rush to get outide and see what further wonders awaited her . Left to stumble down the aisle in a crush of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to everyone " ooh " and " ah " as they looked through the indows and pointed things out to one another . As far ( ; oxen could tell , they all seemed to have totally forgotten about the various powers they 'd lost . pparently , they were so impressed by this place that ne of them could think of anything else . Or perhaps they just did n't care anymore . Coren card one fellow , a round-faced , balding man with huge saucer eyes , say , " I do wish my magnifiers were orking , do n't you ? It 'd be wonderful to see this fascinating architecture up close . But still , it 's beautiful en with standard distance vision . All those statues ! impressive , do n't you think ? " Coren was impressed too , sort of . It was all so big .  | It made him feel like a small insect . When he finally reached the doors of the transport and looked out , he saw a square large enough to hold tens of thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make any sensible person feel uneasy . Coren stepped down to the gleaming white pavement , searched for Lenora in the crowd , and then stumbled over toward her as fast as he could manage . By the time he got there , a man was approaching them . He was perhaps a few years older than Coren , but tall , with broad shoulders , curly black hair , blue eyes , and a dazzling smile . He had a long gold earring in his left ear , and the black tights he wore under his short red jacket made it crystal clear that his legs were not the least bit skinny . Lenora , Coren could see , looked like she was going to swoon . The man glanced at her , smiled that ridiculous smile , and invited her and the others from the transport to follow him . They did . They moved toward the huge crowd in the square , which was standing in orderly rows , a quiet murmur in the air , waiting . Many more transports were lined up beside theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of those in the square were from the city of Farren itself . They were all wearing those black tights , too . Coren thought the tights looked a lot more interesting on the women than they did on the men . In fact , he could n't stop himself from staring at the  | women . Almost all of them were blond , with their hair piled on their heads . Too thin , Coren thought , but attractive nevertheless  --  tall , long legs , shapely , very shapely . It was odd , though , how similar they all looked . And for that matter , how similar all the men looked . There certainly was n't anybody around with red hair or freckles . There was a sudden loud blare of trumpets . Turning toward it , Coren saw a building at the far end of the courtyard even bigger than the rest , a huge gleaming white structure covered with gilt statues and ornate balconies . In front of the building was a raised platform , festooned with red and black streamers . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . Then two long rows of those red-clad , black-haired men marched out of the white building , into the courtyard , and onto the platform . They were followed by a solitary fellow who looked like all the rest except he was dressed all in white , with red trim on his uniform and on the cap he wore on his head . A hush fell over the crowd . The white-clad man stepped up to a podium at the front of the platform . He raised both his arms and stretched them out in a gesture of welcome . His voice , rich and compelling , deep In timbre , flowed out over the audience . " Greetings ! " he called . " Greetings ! " cheered the crowd as one , Lenora  | right along with the rest of them . They all rose to their feet , and so did she . They all stretched both arms toward the man in shining white at the podium , and so did she . And she was happy . She was enjoying herself so much that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen to his feet , stumbling as usual , some moments after everyone else . He seemed to be the only one there without a smile on his face . He 's hopeless , Lenora thought . " Welcome to the newcomers ! " the man at the podium called out , his smile dazzling . As she smiled back , Lenora wondered how she could see his expression . They were quite far back in the crowd , and while she could tell that he was tall and handsome , surely he was too far away for her to make out any details . She must be sensing the smile through his voice , she realized . It seemed to penetrate her very being . " Welcome to the newcomers , " echoed the crowd . Then they sat , as one . And a moment or so later , Coren sat down too , awkwardly stepping on Lenora 's foot in the process . Without withdrawing her eyes from the speaker , she jabbed Coren in the ribs and hissed at him to behave . " Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice intoned . " Together , we will have no wars , no bat ? ties , not even a quarrel between two people . " Together , Lenora thought to herself . How wonderful  | " We will live in harmony and happiness , " the deep voice shouted . " Harmony and happiness , " Lenora and the crowd echoed joyfully . To Lenora it sounded like a single voice with a single will . No mothers and fathers pushing poor innocent victims around here , she told herself , chanting and soaking up every wonderful word . ? We will live in the brotherhood of man. ? " Brotherhood of man . " " We will work and learn together . " " Work and learn together . " " We will rest and play , like children , together . " " Like children , together . " " We are great , together . " " We are great , together . " " We are strong . " " We are strong . " " We are one . " ? We are one. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revak , Hevak . " And the handsome orator lifted his arms above his head once more , to the wild cheers of he crowd . Then he marched off the platform , followed y his troop of red-clad guards . Lenora found herself on her feet again , clapping . his Hevak , for obviously he was Hevak , was amazing . Just one little speech , a few carefully chosen words , nd she knew exactly what he wanted for his world ,  | what she now hoped for , too . She could almost see i t : Men and women working together , everyone at peace , harmony and happiness everywhere . It was just the sort of perfect world she might have created for herself , if her parents had ever been sensible enough to allow her to do it . Coren could see that the glow of ecstatic compliance on Lenora 's face was repeated on all the other faces around him , and he was more than a little worried . He was n't sure what distressed him the most : the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the fact that he was the only one left out . Because it certainly looked as if he were the only one who felt nothing when Hevak spoke  --  nothing buti mild irritation at an arrogant man who was conceited beyond belief . Something strange was going on here , and he did n't like it . He did n't like it at all . Coren tugged at Lenora 's sleeve , trying to get her attention . " I think we should leave this place , Lenora , " he told her . She shook his hand off her sleeve , hardly eve noticing he was there . " Leave ? Why ? I love it here . I 'm not going any where . You can go , if you really want to . " For a brief instant , he imagined himself just grit bing on to Lenora 's arm and dragging her out of the square . He could do it , too if he wanted a couple of broken ribs . Well , what were a few more bruises ? He was just about ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenora 's breath caught in her throat as her gaze landed adoringly on him . " You ten in this row , " he called out , " would you , please , come with me ? Hevak requests it . " He flashed a oothy smile . With a sinking feeling , Coren realized the inevitable : Lenora was going to follow this muscleound oaf , without even asking where they were going . nd he supposed he 'd have to follow along  --  or be left n his own . And leave Lenora on her own . It was becoming cry clear that Lenora might not be safe by herself . It was as if they were all hearing a secret signal that he ould n't hear . Not that he had any idea about how he could help , but somehow , he could n't let her go alone . That made him furious with her . " If I ever get ut of here , " he muttered , " I 'll never speak to her gain . " " Just follow behind me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The last order was completely unnecessary . As they followed the guard through the dispersing rowd , Lenora and the rest moved in locked step cross the gleaming pavement . Coren managed to arch up with them only as they arrived at the bot- ? 93  | tom of the steps in front of the large white building . " Now , " the man said , turning toward them and smiling yet again , " you are privileged indeed . Step inside for a personal meeting with our leader Hevak. "  | The guard turned toward the huge set of double di ors , which suddenly swung open without any action or signal from him , allowing the group to pass into a hall quite different from what Lenora had expected . It was carpeted in shades of purples , reds , and oranges , with designs of trees and flowers . The walls were a rich dark wood that gleamed from the light of the gigantic chandelier above . A burnished wood staircase rose in a spiral from the center of the foyer . " This way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the flight of stairs , Lenora 's heartbeat quickening at the thought of meeting the great man himself . A thickly arpeted hallway ran either way from the staircase . hey walked down the right hallway and through an ( ready open door into a small anteroom . The guard ! locked on the inner door . " Enter . " The guard opened the door and ushered the group He quickly organized them into a row in front of Hevak , who sat behind a large desk of polished wood .  | Hevak rose , smiling . Lenora thought that he looked even more handsome up close than he had out there on the platform . His gaze moved along the row , and it was clear that he was pleased with what he saw . But when he looked at Lenora , he gave a visible start . Lenora flushed . Was something wrong with her ? It was probably her stupid wedding dress . She 'd been so enthralled with her surroundings that she 'd forgotten how completely ridiculous she must look . Slowly Hevak walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped in front of her and stared right into her eyes . Lenora stared back , transfixed . His eyes were the deepest blue she had ever seen . Finally , he blinked and smiled again . And when he smiled at her , he told her how wonderful he thought she was . Not a difficult rebellious child , but a responsible adult , a person with great power and with the wisdom strong enough to use it . A person he could trust . Then he nodded and broke away from her to go to the next person . She felt desolate . The strangest part of it , she realized , was that Hevak never actually said a single word to her . He had conveyed everything , telling her how terrific and mature she was , with just a look from his powerful eyes . What a genius ! Standing beside Lenora , Coren was surprised by the intensity of his dislike for everything that was happen-  | ing . He did n't trust this Hevak . He hated his slick manner and his overdone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obviously mesmerized by the man . All right , maybe he was a little jealous . So what ? As Hevak turned to him , Coren braced himself to remain calm . He knew this man was powerful and there was no use getting into trouble with him unless it was absolutely necessary . Hevak gave Coren a look very different from the smile he had bestowed on Lenora , a look that made him feel about as welcome as a cobra . But somehow , he was n't scared . It just made him curious . Did Hevak dislike him ? And if so , why ? Coren t vied to reach out , ever so tentatively , to see if he could read Hevak 's mind . It was almost a reflex , an unconscious act  --  everything was still silent around him , ; after all but he sent his mind out anyway . Hevak glared at him even more malevolently , and Coren felt an almost physical shove  --  not to his body , hut to his mind . Suddenly he understood . It was Hevak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's powers  --  and probably everyone else 's , too . Why had he done it ? " Why ? " Hevak said , smiling that is , his mouth smiled but his eyes were hard . " A good question . But just what business is it of yours ? Why are you here ? You were not called . " Hevak whispered the words into his mind , so that  | Coren alone could hear them . Coren felt an excruciating pain in his head . It grew stronger , until it was a pounding , throbbing scream . It was Hevak , it came from Hevak . His eyes drilled into Coren 's , pressing , pushing , probing . It was unbearable . Coren 's eyes locked with Hevak 's , and he pushed back with all his might , willing Hevak to look away , willing the force to dissipate . His whole body shook with the effort , but it was beginning to work . Ever so slightly , he could feel the force weakening , retreating . And suddenly he knew what Hevak was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pull Lenore out of her daydreams . She turned to see Hevak gazing malevolently into Coren 's face . " No ! " Coren cried . And as Lenora watched in total confusion , Corers disappeared . One moment he was there , and the next he just  --  was n't . He was gone . Smiling triumphantly , Hevak shook his head a little , then turned to Lenora and took her hand in his . " Do n't worry my dear , " he reassured her . " He 's perfectly safe . It would n't suit him here . He did n't like it , did he ? " Lenora shook her head , unable to speak . " No , I know he did n't . " Hevak flashed his winning smile at her . " And you know it , too . His disappearance is n't completely unwelcome to you , is it ? "  | She could barely breathe . Was that it ? Did she want him gone ? To be honest , she was n't even sure anymore . She certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about him  --  where was he ? And why could n't she remember his name ? " He 's perfectly safe , " Hevak repeated . " Perhaps he decided to go back home . " Lenora gulped and nodded her head as Hevak gazed piercingly into her eyes . What had she been worried about anyway ? There was n't anything to be worried about . Hevak blinked , nodded back at Lenora , and then returned to his desk . " And now , " he said to them all , " let me tell you why you 've been brought here . " Here ? There was no here . It was a void outside of space , outside of time  --  a place that was no place , a place with no back or forth or up or down . There was n't even a floor to stand on . Not that it mattered , because it seemed he had no legs left to do the stand-ing  --  no body at all . Even the freckles were gone . He was nothing but mind , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled this way and that by invisible winds through an endless soup of gray , empty nothing . It was very uncomfortable . It was very irritating . And it was all that greasy monster Hevak 's fault , ( Toren thought . He just willed me out of existence , willed me out of the memories of everybody in that  | stupid country . It 's as if I never was , never existed at all . And now , Coren could sense , Hevak was erasing him completely . Soon the conceited oaf would totally forget there had ever been a Coren  --  and Coren would be stuck in this awful soup forever . But Lenora , surely she had n't forgotten him so eas-ily ? She had to remember , had to . If only he could enter her thoughts , get her to think of him . Then he 'd still exist somewhere , there 'd be at least some chance . Oh please , Lenora , he thought . Think of freckles . Think of skinny legs ! Remember me ! Lenora knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebulous worries about something ? or someone , some boy , maybe ? she listened attentively , enthralled by Hevak 's compelling , creamy voice . She could n't help but feel that he was singling her out , looking directly at her and her alone  --  that she should erase everything and everyone else from her mind . " You are the chosen , " Hevak said , smiling . " I sent a vision to all possible worlds , across the vast reaches of space . I wanted everyone to hear my word , to share my happiness . The strong and powerful of all places and all times received the message , saw the vision . But only the best of those acted on what they heard and were pre-  | pared to make the leap between the worlds at the I6reordained time . You who understood , and leaped , are the chosen , the only ones in all the worlds intelligent enough to be discontented with the pathetic way t pings are run in your own lands , the only ones fed up with the ineptness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever t he best minds are tied down , restrained by silly rules and laws , made only to protect weaklings from their deserved fate . " How true , Lenora told herself , remembering her parents ' silly anger whenever she happened to be brave enough to use the powers she 'd been born with . They just could n't stand knowing that she was stronger than t hey were . " When the moment of transit came , " Hevak 's melodious voice continued , " you heard the call , made t lie leap between the worlds . You were pulled inexorably by your own wise discontent into my dream . You are the chosen . " He smiled warmly , displaying his perfect white teeth . " But you must act again , " he continued . " I have called you here because I have made an important decision . Now that we have perfected this land , it would be heartless to deprive others of our way of life . We have an obligation , a responsibility . We must bring happiness to all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lenora that his unblinking gaze was penetrating to the very heart of her being . " Go back to your worlds , " he said . " Take my dream , our dream , with you . Tell others what you have seen . Show it to them , let them experience it . I will follow and bring you and your people into my fold . Say nothing yet of my arrival . Only show them the wonders . You are my mind . You are me ! " As one , everyone in the room cried in response , " Praise Hevak ! " Everyone , including Lenora.  | As their group was ushered out of the room , a guard standing by the door beckoned Lenora over . " You have been asked to remain behind , " he said . " Our glorious leader Hevak would like to speak to you further . " He looked at her in awe , clearly impressed by the honor bestowed on her , then slipped past her through the doorway to lead the others down the cor-ridor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled with excitement as she turned to face Hevak . He smiled at her . " You do n't need to rush back to Gepeth , do you , Lenora ? " He knew her name ! He knew her country ! But how ? ? He must have seen the surprise on her face . " Oh , " he said , " I know everything about my guests . And you , Lenora , you are very special to me . So special that I 'd like you to remain here . For a while at least . " Remain ? Had n't he just told them all to return home ? It was her duty to do it , was n't it ? And now , he  | wanted her to stay ? " But  --  but why ? " she stuttered . " Because of who you are , " Hevak said , his voice surprisingly fierce . " As I said , you are special , Lenora . Oh , all my guests are special , of course , or else they would n't be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl of glass stones . " Lenora swelled with pride . If only her mother and father could hear this great man acknowledge her true value . " I think you can be of more use here than back home in Gepeth . I need people like you around me , Lenora  --  people with ideas , energy , strength . Special people . I need you , Lenora . " His eyes pierced her own . " If you would do me the honor ? " Lenora 's confusion evaporated . She did n't have to go back to Gepeth after all , and staying here , working with Hevak himself was beyond her wildest dreams . Lenora could n't believe her good luck . " Of course I 'll stay ! " she exclaimed . " Of course ! I love it here ! " " Good ! " Hevak nodded , striking the desk in approval . " I have plans for you , great plans . Mellor ! " he called . Another dark-haired young man , clad in red like all the rest , popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady to a guest suite in the east wing . She 'll be staying with us for a while . " Then Hevak winked at Lenora . " For quite a while . "  | " Yes , sir , " Mellor replied , and with a small bow , he ushered Lenora from the room . Lenora stuttered as she turned to follow . " Thank you , Your  --  Your Honor , uh , Your Highness . . . . " Hevak smiled . " My lord will do nicely . " " Thank you , my lord , " Lenora said , so excited she could barely contain herself . Mellor led Lenora out of Hevak 's office and through a maze of corridors . He was astonishingly handsome , but nothing compared to the great Hevak . Those eyes of Hevak 's , so intense , so compelling . And he thought she was special , an exultant Lenora told herself . " What is this place called ? " Lenora asked Mellor as t hey moved silently on the thick carpeting , the walls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farren Palace , " Mellor replied . Farren Palace  --  a romantic name for a romantic place . It was perfect . After a very long walk , Mellor stopped in front of a thick wood door , opened it , and motioned for her to enter . She gasped when she entered the room . She could n't have imagined anything better . It was decorated in white and gold . Thick white carpet covered t he floors . Two long leather couches were placed in the center of the room , and a gleaming gold chandelier hung over them . There was a large vase filled with flowers on the table between them .  | She followed Mellor across the room to another door , which he opened to reveal a separate bedroom . It was done in pale blue , with a round blue chair and table placed near the window , and a four-poster bed draped in velvet in the center . Yet another door in this room revealed a private bathroom , with a huge bathtub all in sand-colored marble in the center and a gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perfect ! " Lenora sighed . " Of course it is , " Mellor said . " An escort will be sent to take you to dinner . " He bowed and left . Back in the bedroom , Lenora wandered over to yet another pair of doors and opened them . " Oh ! " she exclaimed . It was a closet , and it was filled with exquisite clothes  --  long dresses in velvet and lace , short cotton garments in bold colors , trousers , elaborate silk shirts . And if there was all this here .. . She ran over to the elaborately carved oak chest of drawers by the bed and began to open the drawers . Snowy white undergarments lay stacked in piles . And filmy stockings in all colors , and jewelry , too , a drawerful of necklaces and earrings glittering in confused piles . It just kept getting better and better . She ran back to the closet to choose a gown for dinner and noticed at least ten different pairs of footwear ? shoes , slippers , boots , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? They all seemed to be in her  | size . She could hardly wait to try them on . Through the large , arched window , Lenora could see dusk beginning to settle over the gleaming towers of the city . Her stomach started to rumble . Dinner could n't be that far off . She would bathe in that fancy tub and then change into one of those perfect outfits , she decided . She put in the plug and turned on the water . She examined some of the many glass bottles on the platform around the tub , opening each one , until she found a rose-scented bubble mixture . This she poured liberally under the hot water as it steamed into the tub . Thankfully , she stripped off her mother 's now very bedraggled wedding gown and threw it to the floor . Seeing it lying there , though , she froze suddenly . Was n't she supposed to have been married in that ? To a boy , yes , but she could n't quite picture him  --  her head seemed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His name was . . . he was .. . " Coren , " he shouted into her mind . " Coren , Coren , Coren ! Ca n't you remember that ? ! " And for a moment , she did , but only to want to forget him again . Now she was dismissing him from her thoughts . And suddenly , he could n't remember his name . " Oh , well , " Lenora told herself . " That part of my  | life is over now . I have more important things to do . " Giving the dust-spattered gown a kick across the room , she slipped into the tub and sank into the hot , rosescented bubbles . The marble was smooth against her skin as she lay back and stretched out . She sighed in delight as the water soothed her sore muscles . No question about it , she had made the right choice when she jumped into this place . She picked up a handful of bubbles and blew them across the room . And Hevak had chosen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was special . Because she was strong . She closed her eyes and sighed again . " I 'll just wash up here and then we can have our dinner . " What ? Who ? Lenora 's eyes flew open . Sauntering across the bathroom , heading for the washstand , was a small person , perhaps half Lenora 's height , but clearly fullgrown . In fact , he looked to be around her father 's age , with a touch of gray at the temples . He was dressed in brown suede pants and a brown sweater . And she herself was dressed in  --  nothing . Absolutely nothing ! Thank heavens for all these bubbles , at least . How dare he ? She was too startled to speak . The little man hurried over to the washstand , reached up on tiptoes to run some water , and splashed  | some on his face . Then he turned around and looked it her . She readied herself for him to see her and race out of the room in embarrassment . But he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of disgust on his tiny face . Then he called out to the other room . " l ) rats , " he shouted . " There 's a big one in the tub . And I wanted a real wash . " Big one indeed ! That was the last straw . Lenora began to sputter . " Why why  --  how dare you ! How dare you ! Get out of here this minute ! " " She sees me ! " he screamed , his eyes opening wide in terror . " Sumra ! Lero ! Muni ! She sees me ! " " Of course I see you , " Lenora exclaimed . " Now get out of my room this instant or I 'll I 'll have Hevak himself do something terrible to you ! " He just kept staring at her , his mouth wide open . As Lenora tried to sink further down into the bubbles , three others , just his size , ran into the bathroom . Two females and one male . They all stared at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenora shrieked . " Get out of here ! Get out ! Are you all insane ? " They did n't move . They just stood there , trans-fixed . " Can you really see us ? " one of the women finally said . " Yes ! " They must be out of their minds , Lenora thought . " I can see you . You can see me . I 'm in the tub  | washing . These are my rooms . I do n't want to see you in them . Is that clear ? Is that understood ? " She finished with almost a shriek . The little people turned to one another . " She can see us ! " they shouted . " It 's a miracle , a miracle ! " Lenora had had just about enough . She reached for a thick white towel hanging on a rail attached to the tub and , as she stood up , wrapped it around herself . " All right , " she declared , " that 's it . I am not putting up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my rooms or I will throw you out ! " She tied the towel tightly around her chest . " Now ! " They did n't move . They just kept staring at her . " Fine , " she said , " fine , if that 's the way you want it ! " She pulled herself out of the tub and stepped toward them across the shiny marble floor . Her foot slipped in a puddle , and she felt her legs slide out from beneath her uncontrollably . Then the back of her head crashed against the edge of the tub , and everything went black .  | She was running , running out of the blackness , tripping , almost falling down the steps of a circular staircase , her head filled with barking noises . The dogs were getting closer , closer , nipping at her heels , a wild blur of pink and blue and green and purple , surrounding her . " Ouch , " she shrieked . " Stop it ! Ouch ! " But they kept right on nipping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wrapped around her . The towel tore as the dog clawed its way down . And now they were all over her , clawing , nipping . The towel was in tatters . " Go away ! " she demanded . " Get out of my rooms ! I order you to go away ! " She suddenly remembered what she had to do . " Dominic , Dominic , Dominic , " she shouted . And poof ! The dogs vanished . All but one of them  --  the white one with the little spots of red fur . No , it was n't a dog , after all . It was a boy . Yes , a boy with red hair and freckles , sitting beside her on the stairway and looking into her eyes . She hastily  | wrapped the shreds of the towel around her . " Lenora ! " he said . " You remember me ! " Of course she remembered him . After all the trouble Prince Coren had caused her , she was hardly likely to forget him . Just what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were back home , " she said to him , remembering what Hevak had told her . " I wish I were , " he said miserably . " Where are we ? " She looked around at the strang scene in confusion . " Inside your mind , I think . You must be sleeping o something . This is a dream . " A dream ? How did Coren get into her dream ? Was she just imagining him ? Why him , of all people ? " Yes , it must be a dream , " Coren was saying , excite ed . " And here , while you 're asleep , your guard is down and you can remember me . And I can even remember myself . My name is Coren , is n't it ? " Oh , he was really impossible . Could n't he eve remember his own name ? He turned to her urgently . " Lenora , " he said " you 've got to help me . I ca n't leave here without yo t help . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , when you wake up . You have to think about me or else I 'll stop existing altogether . " " Stop existing ? Do n't be silly . You 're back Gepeth , or Andilla . The real you , I mean . This is just  | a dream . I 'll wake up and you 'll be gone . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of , " he exclaimed . " Do n't oo it , Lenora . Do n't leave me here , please do n't . " Then e moved closer , and grabbed her hand . " It 's dangerous ) r you , too , you know . " Dangerous for her ? What could he possibly mean ? t made no sense . " I know it must sound silly , " he said , " but Hevak is cat what he seems , Lenora . " Hevak , that great leader , that handsome , kindly an , not what he seemed ? It was outrageous , it was 0t ally beyond belief . Why was her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you leave me alone ? " she wailed , tilling her hand away . Then she willed herself to wake from this nightmare , to make him disappear from her cad . " No , Lenora , no ! Do n't go . Remember me. member me . Remember remember remember ... " is voice turned into angry barking , hounding her , rmenting her , as the figure of of some boy or ther  --  disintegrated and turned into gray . Lenora sat up with a start . Where was she ? A terrible pain crashed through her head , and she felt et-self being lowered back down . She closed her yes against the blinding light , then slowly opened them a crack . Little faces hovered over her . She was  | lying on the four-poster bed . Again she tried to sit up . " Slowly now , take it easy , " the young woman said as they helped her to sit . " Drink this , " the older man said , bringing a small silver cup to Lenora 's lips and forcing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slightly bitter , and Lenora struggled unsuccessfully to escape the little person 's firm grasp . But within seconds , she felt better . The pain settled , the nausea abated . She shook the confused thoughts of skinny , red-haired , yelping dogs out of her head and hardly resisted at all as the little person forced her to finish the cup . " Better ? " the young woman asked . Lenora nodded . " Oh , I 'm so glad . " She smiled , then turned to the little man beside her . " You were right , Lero . " " I told you there 'd be medicine in that cabinet , " the young man said . " Hevak always provides everything for his guests . " As Lenora 's head cleared , she remembered what had just happened to her . " This is all your fault ! " she accused the four anxious faces . " You tramp into the bathroom where I 'm lying naked , you stare at me , you go mad just because I can see you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older man interrupted her . " Please , let us introduce ourselves and explain . " An explanation was exactly what she needed . She  | offered a small , regal nod with her head , giving him ermission to continue . " My name is Peetr , " he said with a small bow . " This is my wife , Sumra , my daughter , Muni , and my son , Lero . Sometimes we stay here in the castle , along with many others like us . We come and go as we like , because well , because no one can see us . That is , no one until you . " " What do you mean no one can see you ? " Lenora interrupted . " That 's silly ! I can see you clear as day . " " But you do n't understand , " Muni said . " That 's what shocked us so much . " Muni looked to be a few years older than Lenora , with short black hair , deep brown eyes , and a pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and brown eyes as she did and looked to Lenora to be the older of the two . A quick glance at their mother told Lenora where their dark hair and deep brown eyes came from . They all reminded Lenora of someone , but she could n't think who . " No , I do n't understand , " Lenora insisted . " You are speaking gibberish . " " We do n't really understand it either , " Peetr admitted . " One day we were going off to work , living in our houses , enjoying the company of our friends and families in the evening . We were just like everybody else , normal members of Gragian society . And then , the next day , no one could see us . It was as if we 'd suddenly become invisible  --  everyone below a certain  | height . And , not seeing us , of course , the others just assumed we were n't there at all . Even our friends started behaving as if we 'd never existed . " " Like Angita , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school together , I was a bridesmaid at her wed-ding  --  and all of a sudden , it was like I was n't there . It hurt , it really hurt . " " It happened to all of us , " Peetr said . " And then , big people took over our houses , took over our jobs , took over everything . " " But could n't you make them realize you were there ? " Lenora objected . " Like , punch them or something ? If you punched them , they 'd have to feel it . " " We tried that , " Peetr said . " Believe me , we tried it again and again . We tripped them . We slapped their faces . And yes , we even punched them . But when we did , they just thought they had stomach cramps or something and put it down to food poisoning or a virus sweeping the land . " " We tried throwing things at them too , " Muni said . " Lamps , books , even small pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " all they did was get frightened and run away  --  they thought we were ghosts , I suppose . Then , later , they 'd just return to their homes as if nothing had happened . You have no idea how wearying it is , being ignored like that . How miserable it makes you feel when people treat you as if you do n't exist . Finally , we could n't stand it anymore . We gave  | up our old homes and left them to the big people . Now we live elsewhere as far away from the big people as we can manage . " " Unfortunately , " Lero added , " we ca n't leave them altogether . We still have to come into their houses because we need their food , their clothes , their bathtubs ! We have none of our own . " " It 's not stealing , " Sumra hastily interrupted . " We 'd pay for it if we could , but we ca n't . We ca n't work and earn money to pay for anything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shook her head in disbelief . " You must believe us , " Muni said . it is true . But , " her voice was urgent , " you can see us . You 're a big person yourself , and yet you can see us ! And so it follows t hat you can help us . " The rest of them all nodded at her . Lenora looked around the group of little people , uncertain about what to say or do . " Look , " she said finally . " I 'd like to believe you , I really would , but I can see you perfectly with my own two eyes . " " Yes , " Muni said happily . " You can ! " " And besides , " Lenora shrugged , " even if your story were true , what could I do to help ? " The little people looked at one another , clearly uncertain . Peetr finally replied . " Well , you 're staying here in  | the guest suite so you must know our leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured . " Yes , I do know him , " Lenora said . " Praise him , " she added . " Perhaps , " Peetr suggested , " you could speak to him , tell him about us . If anybody could do something , it 's him . " " Yes , Hevak can do anything , " said Lero . " Hevak would help us , if only he knew of our plight . " " And he does n't , you see , " said Peetr to Lenora . " We ca n't speak to him because he ca n't see us . We 've tried writing notes to him and leaving them on his desk , but for some reason , he just crumples them up and throws them away  --  just like the rest do . I suppose they all think it 's a prank of some sort . " Lenora tried to imagine herself telling this wild story about invisible , little people to the mighty Hevak . " If he really ca n't see you , and if I did talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , " Lenora said . " I would . " Muni took her hand . " Please , just try . " But they could tell from the look on her face that Lenora still was n't convinced . " I know , " Lero said , " let us prove it to you ! Please . Come with us . It 'll only take a minute or two . " Lenora took a long look at them . They did seem quite nice , actually . And desperate for her to listen .  | She just could n't say no . And once they realized they could n't fool her with their crazy story anymore , they 'd leave her alone . She hoped . And if it was true ? Well , she 'd cross that bridge when she came to it . " All right , " she agreed . " I 'll come with you . But get out of here while I dress ! " " Thank you , you wo n't regret it , thank you . " Then they scampered out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , glad that her head was almost back to normal . Whatever they had given her to drink certainly was powerful . She examined the contents of the closet . She knew what she wanted to wear for this expedition with the little people trousers . Princesses were n't allowed to wear trousers back home in Gepeth . Another stupid rule . She found a pair and felt the fine cotton weave and admired the soft sand color . A rust silk shirt hung beside the trousers , and a pair of short brown boots that laced to the ankle were right beneath them . An entire outfit , all matching ! She took everything out , found the appropriate underclothes in the chest of drawers , and was soon admiring herself in the fulllength mirror . Oh yes , she definitely liked this country ( ; rag . After one last satisfied look , she turned and joined t he little people in the outer room .  | We 've decided to take you to the kitchens , " Muni said , obviously very excited . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting , or getting ready for dinner , but the kitchens will be full of workers preparing the meal for tonight . " They hurried down the hallways and then down some back stairs , into a dark corridor . In a few moments , they reached the end of the corridor , and Peetr swung open a pair of double doors leading to a gigantic , smoke-filled , and very hot kitchen . It was filled with people rushing around , carrying things , stirring pots , turning spits . For a moment , they all looked up from their work . Then , seeing strangers  --  or , Lenora wondered , was it just one stranger they saw ? ? most of them resumed their tasks . A big woman , wearing a high chef 's hat and all dressed in white , hurried over toward them . " Yes , miss , " she said curtly , " what can I do for you ? " " I , I 'd just like a little snack , " Lenora told her , " for my friends and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of '  | course , miss , anything for Hevak 's guests . But as you can see " ? she gestured around the room ? " we are just a teeny bit busy right now , and if you could wait for a short while , the banquet will begin and dinner will be served . " " My friends are very hungry , " Lenora said . The chef gave Lenora a dark look . " How many , miss ? " she said in an icy voice . " Well , surely you can see , " Lenora answered , aston-ished . " No , miss , " the chef snapped . " Since they have n't come with you , it would be hard for me to see . " It was true then . " If you are hungry , miss , " she said , obviously trying to control her temper , " I 'll give you a fresh roll to tide you over until dinner . Surely a nice fresh roll will be enough . " The chef did n't notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wiggling his hands in front of her eyes . Lenora was convinced , but Muni and Lero must have wanted it to be crystal clear . They raced over to a tray of steaming hot rolls on the counter nearest the door and began to toss them up in the air and juggle them . " How do you explain that ? " Lenora asked the chef , pointing her finger at the rolls flying through the air . " I do n't , " the woman replied firmly . " It happens all the time . We just ignore it . That is what Hevak asks  | us to do and that is what we do . Praise Hevak . And now , if you do n't mind , I have a lot of work to do , miss . " She thrust a roll into Lenora 's hand and turned back to her work . " Of course , " Lenora muttered , and she backed out of the room . Muni and Lero soon followed , munching on hot rolls . Muni gave a roll to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Peetr asked . " Yes , " Lenora sighed . " I believe you . " " Good , " said Muni . " I knew you would . " " We have to get moving , " Lero urged . " You have to change for dinner . Because you 're going to speak to Hevak for us , are n't you ? " Of course she would . They needed her help . But her heart sank . What if Hevak just thought she was crazy ? It would mean the end of his admiration . He might even send her home . But no , she was being silly . Hevak was good , she was sure of that . He would n't just dismiss her . She 'd have to make him understand , somehow . And once he knew about the little people , he would n't stand by idly and watch their suffering . " Yes . " She nodded . " Of course I 'll tell him . " " Good ! " Muni exclaimed . " I 'll help you choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenora was contemplating herself in the mirror , utterly delighted with what she saw . She was wearing a long diaphanous gown , the  | high neck covered in lace and tiny pearls , the rest flowing layer upon layer of pale blue and mauve . Her slippers were gold , and Muni had done her hair in a braid threaded with gold ribbon . Lenora was pleased . Here she was , dressed in a gown more beautiful than any she 'd been able to imagine  --  and she actually had somewhere to wear it ! A banquet ! She could n't wait . " It fits perfectly , " Muni said . " I knew that style would suit you , Lenora . " Lenora could see her little face in the mirror , beaming up at her . Muni was right . It did suit her . Just then there was a knock on the door . " Who 's there ? " Lenora called . " Beve , at your service , " a voice answered . " Hevak has sent me to escort you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hevak 's handsome servants waiting for her . This one was dressed all in black , with a red sash across his chest and another around his waist . He looked dashing indeed , and as he bowed to Lenora , she barely heard Muni say , " We 'll wait outside the grand hall . Do n't forget us ! " With a smile , Lenora took Beve 's arm and let him lead her down the corridors to the center of the palace . They met others on the way , and as each person entered the grand banquet hall , their name was announced . Lenora was thrilled . She was in a high-ceilinged room with huge arched windows , lit by row upon row  | of glittering chandeliers . After she and Beve had been announced , they walked down a center aisle , past the long tables festooned with candles and flowers , directly to the front table . There Lenora was seated almost in the center . Her heart pounded . Was she that special ? Could it be that Hevak himself might sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room rose . They all began to clap . Then Hevak swept into the room , resplendent in white and gold , nodding to everyone but with his eyes always on Lenora . She wondered if all the others felt the same way . No , it was for her , just for her ! And then , he was there beside her , and he looked her in the eye , bowed low over her hand , and kissed i t . Lenora almost swooned . " Please , my dear , do sit down . " She sank into her chair and gazed at him adoringly . He seemed perfect . He was probably the perfect man . The dinner flew by in a haze . Hevak chatted with her , asking many questions about Gepeth , which she was glad to answer  --  she wanted him to know just how awful a place it was compared to the wonders of Grag . He nodded seriously , confirming her opinions , and lie asked her question after question . He was so intelligent that he understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wise that he felt just as she did about them .  | She did eat , of course , but she really did n't pay much attention to the food . Not with those eyes looking into hers for the entire meal . Then everyone was clapping , and Lenora looked up to see the big woman with the high hat from the kitchen . She wheeled a long trolley into the room and down between the two long tables . She stopped right in front of Lenora and Hevak . On the trolley was a perfect sculpture of a swan . The chef flourished a long stick , then threw something over the swan  --  and the entire thing burst into flames . These quickly died out , and then , to much loud cheering , she cut the swan into little pieces , which the servants carried to the guests . Seeing the chef again , Lenora remembered the little people  --  in the excitement of the banquet they 'd gone completely out of her thoughts . As she savored every bite of the deliciously sweet and astonishingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flaming swan , she told herself the time had come to keep her promise . " You know , my lord , " she began , " I saw the strangest thing today . Four little people wandered into my room . " She gave a little laugh . " It seems I 'm the only one around here who can see them ! And it bothers them , you know , it really does . And I was wondering if you " As she spoke , Hevak 's expression changed to a dark frown , then to a glower.  | " You should not see them , " he roared . " Only I ? only I should only I can ? ! " For a moment he looked quite bewildered . Then he jumped to his feet and shouted out , " Take her away ! She is dangerous ! She is a danger to my person ! Away with her ! " " No ! " Lenora cried . " What are you doing ? I 'm not a danger to you . Stop ! " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lifting her bodily from the chair . " Let go of me ! My lord , I could never be a threat to you , " she pleaded . " I 'm devoted to you , really ! " Hevak turned his face from her , and the guards lifted her up and dragged her away from the table . " Someone help me ! " she screamed . " Stop this . I do n't know what I 've done ! " And then , much to her surprise , " I want my mother ! I want my father ! You ca n't do this to me ! You 'll be sorry ! " They hauled her screaming all the way to the door and out into the corridor , where Muni and Lero stood , horrified expressions on their faces . " You ! " she shouted at them . " This is all your fault . Get away from me , get away , get away , get away ! " She was so angry that she tried to kick at both Muni and Lero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of range . " It 's not our fault , " Muni said as she ran after her . " Who is she talking to ? " one of the guards said . " Beats me , " the other replied . " She must be soma ' nutcase Hevak needs to get rid of . Talking to thin iir.  | Lenora decided it might be wise not to say anything for a while . She clenched her jaw and let herself be dragged . Down the stairs they went , over the thick carpets , then down more staircases of plain wood , until Lenora thought they could go no lower . Soon the smells around them became distinctly unpleasant . The wood was replaced by stone floors and stone walls dripping with damp . Lenora held her silence until she saw a disgusting little animal scurrying down the hallway . Then she screamed . " Let me go ! " she pleaded . " There 's been some terrible mistake . Please . Just let me talk to Hevak . Just let me explain . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , stopped , threw her in , and slammed the door shut behind her . Lenora turned and beat on the door . " Let me out ! Let me out ! " She was furious ! How dare they treat her this way ? And she was afraid . What was that horrid little animal with a sharp face and long tail that had run in front of her ? Were there any more of those awful things here in this room ? She turned but could see nothing except black . Black everywhere . " Let me out ! " she screamed again . And then she began to cry . " I want to go home , " she sobbed . " I hate this place . How dare they treat me like this ! "  | As her eyes adjusted to the dark , Lenora looked at her surroundings . From the small bit of light that came in from the cracks around the door , she could dimly make out a tiny room . There was no window , no bed or table or chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things might be hiding in that murky gloom , all set to scoot across the floor and She did n't even want to think about it . Well , this was a fine mess . Hevak had seemed so kind , so wonderful . And then he was ranting and raving like a banshee . It was certainly worse than any tantrum she 'd ever had . And he 'd had the nerve , the utter gall , to have her picked up like a sack of potatoes by those big ugly brutes of his and unceremoniously dumped into this horrid , dank hole . As if she were some common crim-inal  --  she , Lenora , the Princess of Gepeth ! How dare he ? How could he ? Well , he was n't what  | he seemed , that was certain , for all his wavy hair and pearly teeth and big ideas . No , he was nothing but a big bully who pushed everybody around and then exploded if he did n't get his own stupid way . She hated him . Loathed and despised him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had herself to blame . She 'd been warned , after all . " He 's not what he seems , Lenora " ? she clearly remembered someone saying that to her . Why had n't she listened ? Whoever said it was right . But who was it ? Who had said it , and when ? Ah , it was coming back now  --  amazing how anger helped you to think more clearly . It was in a dream . Yes , in the bathroom , after she fell and got knocked out , she 'd dreamed of a stairway  --  and a boy . He 'd warned her about Hevak , and she had been furious with him and dismissed him from her mind . It was a boy she knew , a boy she remembered knowing , once . Yes , a boy with cute freckles and interesting red hair . Coren ! That was his name . He had asked her to remember him . Suddenly she remembered him perfectly . She could see his face in her mind as clearly as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she have forgotten him so totally , so completely ? And then she gasped and put her hand to her mouth . Hevak ! Of course . Back there , in Hevak 's office  | Hevak had done something , and Coren had disappeared , right before her eyes . Is that what had happened to the little people ? Could Hevak actually make people disappear ? Was it possible ? Some words of her mother 's echoed in her mind . " You 've imagined some silly world where your own dear , sweet mother does n't even exist . " Of course it was possible . And for some reason , Hevak had done it to an entire people . Or almost done it , it seemed , for somehow , she still knew they existed even if no one else did . Perhaps he had done something like that to Coren . Yes , Hevak had obviously lied to her . Coren was n't back home at all . He was probably floating around in some gray place , like the one her mother had told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place like that . She could see him clearly in her mind now , sitting on a stair , looking at her pleadingly and saying , " Do n't leave me here , please do n't ! " As if there were anything she could do about it now . But she could n't , of course . Hevak had blocked her powers . It made her angry . If it was n't for Hevak , she 'd have Coren out of that gray place and back this very instant , right here in this very spot where she could look after him and keep him out of trouble .  | Oof . All the air rushed out of her lungs , and she felt herself crushed by a heavy weight . The ceiling was falling in , the whole place was caving in on her , she thought in a panic . She beat against the heavy weight with all her might , trying to get some space to breathe . " Oof ! Ouch ! Ooh ! " Now the ceiling was talking ! " Ouch ! Ouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenora , stop it ! " And now it was hitting back at her . It was n't the ceiling , after all . It was a person . Someone had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and landed on her like a ton of bricks and nearly killed her . It was him , of course  --  Coren . " You bumbling fool ! Honestly ! Get off me ! What is the matter with you ! " She jabbed him again . " Ouch ! That hurts ! I 'll get off , Lenora , if you let go of me . Ouch ! " Coren said . With one last little jab , she pulled herself free . Unfortunately , her wonderful banquet gown ripped in the process . Yet another dress ruined ! And then it hit her . He was back ! She had wanted Coren back , and he 'd come back ! " Coren ! " she shouted in wild excitement . " I did it ! I brought you back ! " Without even realizing what she was doing , she reached over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planted a kiss right on his lips . Even more astonishing , he kissed her right back . A  | rather good kiss , too , she had to admit . Not that she had anything to compare it with  --  it was her first real kiss  --  but it was much better than anything she 'd expected from him , much better even than anything she 'd imagined . She kept her arms folded tightly around him and waited for another . " Good heavens , " he said , breaking from her grasp and taking in their murky surroundings . " Where on earth are we ? "  | We 're in some kind of jail , in the basement of Hevak 's castle , " Lenora grumbled , irritated at having to admit how much trouble she 'd landed herself in . " What are we doing here ? " Coren asked , totally bewildered . " It 's all because of these little people I met , " Lenora said , the vexation clear in her voice . " You see , they 're invisible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly , but apparently , nobody else can . They 're invisible to everyone but me . " " Oh , " said Coren , confused . Lenora did n't notice . " So , " she continued , " I decided to tell Hevak about them . About the little people , I mean . That was a big mistake , because for some reason , he was furious with me ! He said something about me being dangerous me , of all people ! " Her voice shook with emotion . " How could anybody think I was dan-gerous ? " For some reason , Coren did n't answer . " And then , " she continued , " he threw me down  | here ! He had his guards drag me down here like a sack of potatoes . There are disgusting rodents down here ! " " Hevak ! " Coren said , his voice grim in the darkness . " I should have known . He 's the dangerous one . " " I know . You should have seen his face . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have to imagine it . I saw it myself , back there in his office when he made me disappear like that . It was awful . " " But why ? Why did he do it ? " " Because he did n't want me here . I was n't supposed to come in the first place . And just before he made me disappear I discovered that he controls everything here . He 's the one who took away our powers , every-one 's powers . He controls how people act , what they can do , everything . In fact , once he got rid of me I think he must have forgotten about me . He must have , or I never could have gotten through to you just now and gotten back here . " " Gotten through ? " Lenora said , puzzled . " But I brought you back here . It was me , not you . I imagined you here , and here you are ! " Then she realized he did n't know yet that 's why he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have my power back ! " There was silence for a moment . " Uh . . . well , no , you do n't , Lenora . It 's me . I 'm the one who has my power back . " " What do you mean ? I clearly remember thinking you ?  | " It was me doing it , not you . That 's why you suddenly remembered me . It was me , inside your head . You see , " he explained patiently , " when you started to think of me , I was able to enter your thoughts . And once you completely remembered me , I just reappeared automatically , because Hevak 's disappearing trick ca n't work as long as someone remembers you ! " " Never mind Hevak , " Lenora said , her eyes narrowing . " Do you actually mean to say that you came into my thoughts totally uninvited ? Is that what you 're telling me ? " " What was I supposed to do ? You 'd completely forgotten me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was horrible . I could have been there forever ! " " That 's no excuse ! " Lenora snapped . " There are worse things than hanging around in the gray  --  like invading a person 's mind , for instance ! " " You 've got to be joking ! " he spat out . " Why , that 's the most selfish thing I 've ever heard ! That 's what comes of living in a country where no one can enter anyone else 's thoughts . You have no sympathy for anyone else because you have no idea how they feel ! You 're just a spoiled brat ! " A spoiled brat ? " How dare you ! " she exclaimed . How dare he get mad at all ? A meek apology would be more in character . That experience in the gray had definitely had an effect on him . She sat and thought about it for a moment . Then ,  | suddenly , she reached out and jabbed him . He clutched his stomach . She 'd acted so quickly that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did you do that ? " " To see if it would hurt . And it did . So , you 're really there . You 're not just a figment of my imagination . " " Of course I 'm not , I just said that . " " Well , then , think about what you 're saying . Your people can read thoughts and make one another imagine that things are real  --  but you still know they 're just thoughts , correct ? " " Yes . So ? " " So it 's me who can really turn my thoughts into reality . If you 're real enough to feel pain , then I must have my powers back . So there ! " And he thinks he 's so smart , she added to herself . " Well , I 'm certainly not as stupid as you think , " he shot back . " It was me that brought me back , not you . " " Get out of my mind , you  --  you " For a long , tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mad , " Lenora finally said . " I wish you were at the bottom of a deep lake . " All at once , Coren was n't there anymore . " Oh ! " Lenora said . Well , at least he 'd have to believe her now . She wished him back again , but across the room . He 'd barreled into her one too many times already . Coren was dripping wet and coughing up fishy-  | tasting lake water . " I give up , " he said morosely in between coughs . " You have your powers back . We both have our powers back . " Finally he believed her . Lenora moved over to him and gave him some good stiff blows on the back to get the water up . " Now that we have them , we have to figure out how to use them to get out of this place . " " We could just go home , " Coren suggested , hope-fully . " No , I promised those little people I 'd help them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll imagine us out of this horrible place . Let us be oh , I suppose , standing in the corridor just on the other side of this door . " " Do n't , Lenora ! " Coren shouted , leaping to grab her and spraying her with fishy water . " There 's a guard out there , a really big one . I can sense his thoughts , he 's armed , he 'll ? " But it was too late . She had already closed her eyes and willed it to happen . And opened them onto the darkness of the cell . " It did n't work , " she cried . " Why did n't it work ? " " It 's a good thing it did n't work , " said Coren , shaking his arms and legs to get rid of some of the water and spraying her yet again . " You could have gotten us killed . Just let me think . " He paused . " This must have something to do with Hevak . Perhaps Hevak can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , and he ca n't control what he does n't know . "  | " I do n't understand . " " It 's perfectly logical . He 's forgotten all about me . I do n't exist for him . And since he knows nothing about me , I have my powers back . He ca n't block whats he does n't know is there . " " I suppose that would be true . But what about me ? Why can I do some things but not others ? " " You can do what he does n't know about ! He did n't know about me being here , so he could n't control you sending me to that stupid lake and nearly drowning me  --  honestly , Lenora ! I 'm still soaking . " " I said I was sorry . " " But Hevak does know about this prison , so you ca n't change it . And he wants you to be in it , so you ca n't imagine yourself out of it . " " Well  --  it makes sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " And she could n't help but admire his thinking . " But what can we do then ? How can we get out of here ? " " There has to be a way , " Coren said . As if in answer to his request , a beam of light pierced the gloom and the small square window in the door opened . " Are you all right , Lenora ? " a voice whispered . It was Muni . Lenora could see the top of her head through the small bars in the window . " You ! It 's your fault I got stuck in this awful place . " " I 'm sorry , Lenora , " Muni said . " We all are . You  | have to believe me , we never imagined anything like that would happen . At any rate , we 've come to get you out . We 've arranged a diversion . A rather good one , too . Right about now " ? she turned toward where the guard must be standing ? " yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find himself in a sticky situ-ation . " And she stared to giggle . A surprised shout blotted out her laughter . " Aagh ! " the guard shrieked . " What is that ? What 's happening ? Ooh , " he wailed , " get off me , get off me , get ugh ! " Then his screams became muffled , as if his mouth had suddenly filled up with something . " He 's gone , " Muni said triumphantly , turning back toward the window again . Then Lenora and Coren heard the key in the door , and it swung open to reveal Muni and Lero standing there , Muni perched on Lero 's shoulders . " Good work , Father ! " Muni shouted down the corridor as she jumped down to the ground . " It 'll take that big lug awhile to get that stuff off him ! " She turned back toward the cell . " Let 's go . " Lenora stepped through the door first . She could see Peetr and Sumra standing at the end of the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar of honey . " We dumped it over his head ! " said Peetr as he noticed her puzzled face . " Simple but sweet , " said Sumra.  | Peetr laughed . " No time to waste , " he chided . " Let 's hurry . " Suddenly he noticed Coren and paled . " Who 's that ? " " He can see you , too , " Lenora said . " Ca n't you , Coren ? " " Why , yes , " Coren said , " of course . Why should n't I see them ? " " Who are you ? " Lero asked . " My name is Coren . Prince Coren of Andilla . I came here to this land with Princess Lenora , and then Hevak got rid of me by imagining me out of existence . " " And , " Lenora said , " I 'm sure he did it to your people , too , and that 's why you 're invisible to everybody . Do n't you think so , Coren ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these people are still here . But I was floating around in that gray place , where I could n't even remember my own name . No , it 's not the same . Still , it was Hevak who did it ? that 's one thing we can be sure of . " " Hevak ? " Peetr was astonished . " That is n't possible ! " Lero added . " Hevak is good , " Sumra said with great assurance . " It could n't be him . " " Praise Hevak , " the little people all murmured . " But " a look of horror spread across Muni 's face ? " it had to be him . He controls everything . Why did n't we think of that before ? "  | " Probably because he did n't want you to , " said Lenora ruefully , remembering how she herself had forgotten Coren . The little people were clearly stunned by the idea . They stood there in shock , unable to move . " Could we , perhaps , discuss this later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entire castle are n't after us , for instance ? " " You 're right , " Lenora said . " Let 's go . " She moved swiftly off down the corridor . Furious that she 'd started off without even thinking about where she was going , Coren rushed after her . The little people followed , still in a daze . Muni , who seemed a little less bewildered than the other members of her family , overtook Lenora and then led the way as the group crept up the stairs . She was about to turn to her left when Coren put a hand on her shoulder . " Do n't go down there , " Coren whispered . " Some of Hevak 's people are coming toward us . " " How do you know ? " Peetr asked as he trotted up behind Coren . " I can sense their minds , " Coren replied . " I 'm reaching out , trying to feel if anyone is around . " " That 's ridiculous , " Muni said , moving forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , making a gesture with her hand to stop Coren and Lenora . " You 're right , " she whispered ,  | looking at Coren in awe . " They are there . If we 'd gone that way , they would have seen you two for sure . How did you do that ? " " It 's just this gift I have , " Coren whispered back . He paused for a moment , as if listening , and then pointed . " That way is clear . Does it lead to an exit ? " Peetr nodded . They all hurried down the corridor , up another flight of stairs , down another corridor . Finally , they saw a large door ahead of them . " Hurry , " Coren urged , " I can feel them , many of them . Big brutes , too . Not far away now . And they 're really upset  --  they 've discovered our escape ! " The group slipped through the door , which opened on to the grounds behind the palace , and quickly shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their bearings . As she caught her breath , Lenora noticed Coren staring at her , his mouth slightly open . " You look like a fish ! " she declared . " What are you gaping at ? " " You , " he said , still staring at her . He turned beet red and glanced at the ground . " That 's a lovely dress , " he mumbled . Lenora felt herself flush , too . " Well , " she finally managed to get out . " Yes , it was lovely , before somebody ripped it . But this is n't exactly the time to be admiring a new fashion . "  | " It was n't the fashion I was admiring , " Coren muttered . Then he started . " They 're right behind us ! " he said . " Just behind that door ! "  | The group surveyed their surroundings . By now it was night and the sky was dark , but the scene before them was lit by many tall lamps , and Lenora could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrubs , trees in blossom , and lush green grass cropped close . There were people strolling around , and others riding sweet little ponies , quietly cantering up and down the pathways . " If we can just get through the park and into the city streets , " Muni said , " we can lose them . I know the city like a mother knows her baby 's face ! " " Let 's get those ponies ! " Lenora shouted , and raced toward one of them . " Wait , Lenora , wait ! " Coren shouted after her . " There are people riding them ! " Lenora ran toward a young man sitting astride one of the ponies . " Hey , you with the hat , " she called , " come here ! I have to tell you something . " He turned the pony toward her , and when he bent over , she yanked his hair and pulled until he came right out of the saddle and landed on the ground , too amazed to say  | or do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug her heels into its flanks , pulled on the pony 's reins , turned , galloped back , and scooped up an utterly astonished Muni into the saddle in front of her . Coren took a deep breath . How could she ? Well , he was n't going to do that . But he had to get out of here somehow . He ran over to a young woman on a pony , then paused , bowed , and said , " Please , miss , my sister is in terrible trouble ; it 's an illness of some sort ! " He pointed at Lenora , who was galloping wildly away and toppling over anyone who got in her path . " Look how she 's behaving ! Could I borrow your pony to go after her ? " The young woman smiled sympathetically . " Poor dear . Of course you can have the pony . " She leaped lightly off , and Coren politely thanked her as he mounted . Then he turned back to the little people still standing by the door . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walk . No one can see us ! " " Who cares , " Lero shouted , " I want a ride ! Wait ! " And he rushed over and vaulted onto the pony . As he threw his arms around Coren 's waist , a mob of guards burst from the palace . They saw Lenora galloping away , and one of them began to shout , " Get the transports , we 'll run them down from the air . " " Go to the underground warrens , " Peetr yelled to Coren and Lero . " They ca n't track you there ! "  | " Yes , Father , " Lero called back . " We 'll meet you there ! " Then he yelled into Coren 's ear . " You smell like fish ! And why are you so wet ? " " It 's a long story , " Coren shouted back over his shoulder as he spurred his pony . Soon they were galloping in close pursuit of Lenora . As they raced along , Lero called ahead to Muni . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathways , " Muni advised Lenora , hanging on for dear life . " It 's true everyone can see you , but it 's faster than going through the trees . We just have to get across this park before they manage to get their transports to us . Once we 're in the city we can lose them . " Lenora , her hair quickly coming loose from its braid and whipping around her face , grinned despite herself . She knew she was in danger , but barreling through the park , the wind on her face , the speed  --  it was fun . She glanced back to see Coren , a determined grimace on his face , trying to keep up with her . " She has no fear , " Coren grumbled . " What ? " said Lero . " She has no fear , " Coren repeated louder . " Lenora . She 's reckless . " " I would admire her for that , " Lero said . " I do , " Coren admitted . " But she 's dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " What 's life without adven-ture ? "  | " Calm , " Coren answered . " Life is calm without adventure . " " Yes  --  and boring ! " Lero declared . " Well , yes , " sighed Coren . " Boring sounds very good to me right now . " Lero laughed . " You do n't mean that ! " " Do n't I ? " Much to his surprise , Coren was n't sure . He seemed to be feeling so different , now that he was no longer in the gray . And acting differently , too . Why , he 'd even kissed Lenora when she grabbed him  --  kissed her right back without even thinking . And enjoyed it . Not that he had anything to compare it with , it being his first real kiss . He took a quick glance back down the path . Some of the guards had also taken ponies and were following them , but they were still a good distance behind . Then , he heard a loud noise overhead , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spine . " Engines , " Lero shouted . " Transport engines . Hevak has a landing surface for flying transports right - on top of the palace . They 'll soon be airborne ! " " Wonderful , " Coren exclaimed , " flying transports ! " The mere sound of them was scary . " How much far-ther ? " " Not much , " Lero assured him . " Turn off this path , " Muni ordered Lenora . " We 'll leave the ponies here . "  | Lenora did as requested . They waited impatiently for Coren and Lero . When the two young men joined them , Muni and Lero took the lead . " Do n't forget , no one can see us , " Muni said . " So you two just walk quickly as if you know where you 're going . The streets wo n't be busy now anyway . " The group hurried out of the park and into the street lit only by pale lamps . They all felt safer away from the bright light of the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door to a large square building . Just inside was a set of steps . They hurried down into a long corridor that curved off into the distance , with doors opening on to it all along the way . " Where are we ? " Lenora asked . " This corridor connects almost all the buildings in the city , " Muni said . " But this is just the top layer , " Lero added . " It soon starts circling downward . If we can get to the lower level without being detected , we 'll be safe . " " Safe for the moment , " Coren cautioned . Lenora looked at him and rolled her eyes . " Well , that 's better than the alternative , " she said as she strode briskly forward .  | As they spiraled their way down the curving corridor , ever lower and lower , Coren sent his mind out , trying to catch the thoughts of their pursuers . Every once in a while he could sense guards on the ground overhead , but so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also catching random thoughts of the people who lived above . Those thoughts he found trou-bling they were so ordered , so controlled . Everyone he overheard was concentrating strictly on performing tasks . There were no flights of fancy , no children imagining monsters or wonderful creatures , no adults telling stories . They might as well be machines , he thought , like those transports they have . " What are these corridors for ? " Lenora asked . They were clean and gleaming white and lit by a soft glow . Nobody else was in them , and after a little while there were no longer doors opening off them . " Well , " Lero replied , " this is the oldest part of Farren City . The story goes that in his younger years Hevak built this as a play area . He created teams that  | tried to outsmart one another in an elaborate game of hide and seek . " " Does he still use it ? " asked Coren . " No , " Muni replied , " he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game too easily and got bored with it . " " Anyway , " Lero continued , " he seems to have forgotten all about it . We 've never seen him or anyone else down here . " That was all the conversation they had during the whole trip . They walked quickly  --  ran , too , whenever they could  --  and had little energy left for talking . The circles gradually grew tighter and tighter , and the corridor sloped more and more , until they felt like they were walking down a hill . " Almost there , " Muni panted , and Lenora saw a rounded arch ahead of them . They stepped through the arch , and both Lenora and Coren stopped and gasped . Beneath and above them , a huge cave stretched almost as far as their eyes could see . " It 's enormous , " Lenora said . " It 's amazing the city does n't fall into it , " Coren observed . " Anything is possible for Hevak , " Lero said . It was n't clear whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , revealing an area almost  | as large as the entire grounds that surrounded Lenora 's home in Gepeth . But it was n't just one big cave , it was full of strange rock formations that broke it up into a multitude of smaller units . As they looked more closely , Lenora and Coren could see that each of these pockets was full of people . Little people . Muni and Lero laughed as Lenora and Coren gaped in amazement at the tiny multitude below them . " Did n't know there were so many of us , did you ? " said Lero . " Most of our people live here , " Muni explained , " because we got sick of being reminded all the time that we do n't really exist . In small doses , it 's bearable ? but not as a steady diet . Here , among ourselves , we 're as real as you are . " Lenora looked down at the busy scene beneath her in wonder . Each small unit looked cozy and warm . Multicolored thick rugs covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a soft glow of light over everything . " Do the lights ever go off ? " Coren asked . " No , " explained Muni . " There 's no day or night here . Only this . " " I think Hevak must have forgotten about this place at some moment when the lights were on , " said Lero . Just then Peetr and Sumra came up behind them ,  | puffing , Peetr clutching his side from running too fast . " Ah , thank goodness , " he panted , " you 've arrived safely . Please follow us to our little home . " Coren and Lenora followed Peetr as he made his way down from the ledge , through a maze of rock and staring eyes . A hush fell on the little people as Lenora and Coren passed . The two of them were obviously big people . What were they doing down here ? " Now we must plan , " Peetr said as they settled down on some soft cushions in a relatively private enclave . " Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your young friend is as well . How can we help one another ? " Lenora thought for a moment . " What I ca n't understand , " she said , " is why you and your people are in this strange state . In between , I mean , here but not here . When Hevak wanted to get rid of Coren he just got rid of him . Totally . " " Perhaps , " Coren suggested , " it takes a long time for an entire people to completely forget another entire people . I was just one person , after all , and hardly anybody here even knew me , but you and your people " ? he turned to Peetr ? " everyone knew you , knew about you . Some were your friends , were n't they ? " The little people nodded . " It would take a lot of work to erase you from all those people 's minds . But once it 's obvious to Hevak  | that no one sees or remembers you anymore , he 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was clear from the expression on their faces that the thought terrified the little people . " Well , " Lenora said in a determined voice , " we certainly ca n't let him disappear you altogether . I wo n't have it . We have to stop him . " " But how ? " Sumra sighed . " He 's so powerful ! " " Do n't worry , Mother , " Lero said , draping his arm over Sumra 's trembling shoulder . " We 'll find a way . We will  --  wo n't we ? " Lero addressed his question to Lenora , but it was Coren who answered . " I think I 've discovered something that could help , " he said slowly . " It 's something in your minds . " Muni frowned and turned to him . " You entered our minds ? " " Yes , " said Coren , " and ? " " I do n't like that , " Muni objected . " Not at all . Surely you should have asked first ? " Coren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lenora could n't help herself . She burst out laughing . Coren shot her an angry glance . " It 's hard not to hear things sometimes , " he said . " That 's no excuse , " said Peetr . " No excuse at all , " said Muni . " If you want my opinion , " Lenora said , suppressing a giggle , " I think you 're being too hard on him . "  | " But you get furious when I do it to you ! " Coren said . " That 's different , " Lenora said . " If this is something that can help , none of us can afford to be too sensi-tive . " Coren shook his head . He would never understand her . " So what did you find ? " Lenora asked . " Lenora is right , " Muni conceded . " Tell us what it is , Coren . " " Trolls , " Coren replied . " Trolls ! " exclaimed all five of his companions at once . They looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , trolls ! Short stocky people with frizzy hair and sharp teeth . Some of them have more than one head . I believe they used to live here , in Grag , just as you do , " he said to the little people , " because they 're stored clearly in your minds . " " Well of course they are , " said Sumra . " Everyone knows about trolls , but they 're just imaginary , storybook creatures . " " No , " Coren objected , " they 're not . The trolls I see in your minds do n't feel like storybook creatures . They 're real . They  --  well , they smell . Really bad . I think Hevak sent these trolls off to the gray  --  and I think we should bring them back . " " But why ? " Lenora asked , intrigued . " What would we accomplish by bringing them back ? "  | " I 'm not sure , really , except that I assume Hevak did n't want them here . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of threat to his power . " Yes , " Lenora mused . " It makes sense . Even all of us being here and knowing we all exist defies his control , right ? Well , the more the merrier . " " That 's what I was thinking , " Coren said . " At any rate , we have a responsibility , do n't we ? I mean , once we know they 're there , we ca n't just leave them there . " " Of course not , " Lenora said . " And besides , " she added , rubbing her hands , " it sounds like fun ! " The little people looked horrified . " Trolls are disgusting ! " Muni said . " They 're cruel and dangerous ! " Sumra warned . " They 're not trustworthy ! " Peetr added . " Now I know for certain that those trolls once existed , " Coren said , " because if they did n't , why are you getting so upset about them ? " It was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . " And besides , " Coren continued , " all that about the trolls being disgusting , deep down in your thoughts you know it is n't true . They 're not cruel at all . Deep down , you like trolls . " He stopped a moment to capture a thought . " Hulder , for instance . Yes , Hulder , she was a friend once , Sumra ! Your best friend ! And , and , a bridesmaid at your wedding ! Was n't she ? "  | " Hulder ? She could n't  --  I would n't I ? " Summ looked very confused . " Hevak must have planted those thoughts in your brain , " Coren continued . " Made you think of trolls as disgusting and smelly . " " Oh , it 's all nonsense , " Peetr said impatiently . " How do we know these imaginary trolls would even be willing to help us ? " " They 'd help , " Lenora said . " They 'd know they have to help defeat Hevak or they 'll end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point , " Lero remarked . " And it 's worth a try , at least . " He looked eagerly at Peetr who , in turn , looked at Sumra . She was muttering to herself . " Hulder ? Did I know a Hulder ? " " Good , " said Lenora briskly , smiling at the little people , " then it 's settled . What do we do , Coren ? " " To bring all those trolls back , we 'll need everyone 's help , " Coren said . " All your people , Peetr . They 're going to have to think about trolls as hard as they can . " " I 'll go speak to them , " Peetr said . As he and his family went off to gather the others , Coren told Lenora his plan to get the trolls back . " I 'll try to make the little people conscious of the trolls hidden in their memories , " he said , " and then you can just make them real . It should be quite sim-ple. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little people to think about trolls was n't going to be as easy as it sounded . When Peetr had gathered them all together into a large meeting place in the center of the cave and told them what had happened to Lenora and what Coren had seen in their minds , they just laughed . " Oh , sure , trolls , " said a fellow in the front row . " As if our glorious leader Hevak would allow ugly things like that in his country ! " " And besides , " added another , " nobody can read thoughts . That 's just a fantasy . " Those around him chortled gleefully . Peetr turned to Coren . " I was worried this might happen , " he said . " You 'd better get busy and do whatever it is you 're going to do , because they wo n't hang around here much longer . " Coren gazed out at the multitude of laughing , skeptical little faces and shook his head . " It wo n't work if they do n't believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lenora snapped . " All you have to do is gain their confidence . I know ! " She leaned over and whispered into his ear . " That might do it . " He nodded . " I 'll give it a try . " " I 'll get their attention for you . " Lenora turned to the crowd , who were still laughing and hooting . " Quiet ! " she shouted , in a voice so loud it cut right through the din and brought immediate silence . " Now listen . Prince Coren of Andilla has something to say . "  | Coren had his eyes closed . Suddenly he opened them and announced , " You 're right , Murno , " and he turned toward an old man near the front . " I was born with these red spots on my face . They 're not a rash . " Murno started , astonished to have his private thoughts revealed in this way . " And yes , Avila , " he went on with growing confidence , " I do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't tell a living soul . I promise you , your secret is safe with me . " The little woman named Avila blushed a deep red . " And you , Dravilla , stop worrying about where your young Arfa is . He 's just over there behind that rock , watching some ants and thinking about what he 'd like for a bedtime snack . Dried apricots on toast . " This last bit of information persuaded the entire assembly , for it seemed young Arfa had a reputation for thinking about food all the time , and a passion for dried apricots . " Good , " said Lenora as she watched the crowd buzz in astonishment . " I knew that would work . " Then she shouted for silence again . " Now that you know Prince Coren can read your thoughts , " she called out , " you must try to believe what he has found there . We must all try . Trolls ? think of trolls . " " Yes , " Coren added . " Close your eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you . "  | After a brief moment of hesitation , the little people did as he asked . " All right . " It was Coren 's voice , but Lenora was n't hearing it with her ears . It was inside her head . " Get ready , " it was saying . " The little people are thinking about the trolls now . I 'm going to gather up all their thoughts and throw them into your head . Then you have to will them into being . " Lenora was n't altogether sure she liked him talking to her like that , but she nodded and then braced her-self . Coren turned back to the crowd . " Picture them . Concentrate hard . " Suddenly Lenora 's head was full of a multitude of creatures , fuzzy-haired creatures with one head and two heads and three heads , and they were so cute , adorable , and she knew all their names and everything about them all at once ! They were real ! She wanted them to be real ! They had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't real , she 'd just close her eyes and scream until they became real . Then suddenly she felt a tremendous surge of energy and the air around her crackled and was filled with hideous roars and frightened screams . It had worked . Every inch of space was covered in trolls !  | There were , perhaps , thousands of trolls . They were about the same size as the little people , with shoulders twice as broad , flat faces , large noses , and eyes that glittered and bulged . Some had two heads , and some had more . " We did it . " Coren grinned , still shaking from the effort . " Yes , " Lenora agreed . " We certainly did . " The trolls were in a fit of terror and anxiety , not knowing where they were , what had happened , or what would happen . The little people were also terrified . They ran into their little enclosures , grabbing their children , screaming in fear . " They 're ugly ! They 're filthy ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do something ! " Peetr called out , over the increasing din . Lenora and Muni and the others nodded . They tried to shout over the roars and screams in an effort to get everyone to calm down . Coren just sank down to  | the ground and covered his face with his hands . Lenora looked at him and shook her head . He gave up so easily . The trolls slowly began to quiet . It started with the children , who wandered over to Coren , looking at him with some curiosity , and it quickly spread to the adults . Lenora 's and Muni 's shouts of " Calm down , be quiet , stop shouting " soon dwindled away as they watched the crowd form around Coren . He looked up and smiled . " You do n't have to be afraid , " he said to the trolls . " This is real . We 've brought you back . " So , Lenora realized , Coren had n't given up . He had been communicating , mind to mind , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed  --  for now they began to edge out of the caves and approach the trolls . For a moment , nobody spoke . The two groups just stood there , eyeing one another in disbelief . It was Sumra who broke the silence . " Hulder ? " she said as she gazed at a troll with two heads . " Is  --  is it you ? " " Yes , " the troll 's two heads said simultaneously . " It 's us ! " Hulder rushed over , embraced Sumra , and kissed her on both cheeks at the same time . After that , it was pandemonium , as old friends recognized one another and rushed to meet again . All of the thoughts Hevak had planted about how disgusting  | the trolls were had disappeared like clouds after rain . Laughter and conversation filled the caves . In the midst of it all , Coren motioned Lenora over . Muni and Lero followed her . " What is it ? " Lenora asked as he moved them slightly away from the jubilant crowd . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to calm them , " Coren answered , " I saw something . Something else ! " " What was it ? " Muni demanded . Coren noted that she did n't seem to have any qualms about him reading the trolls ' minds . " I saw memories , " he said , " just like your memories of the trolls . The trolls have things in their minds which your people have no memory of at all . " " Things ? " said Muni , bewildered . " What are you talking about ? " " There are others who have been banished from this land , " Coren said with growing certainty . " Hevak must have been sending groups off into the gray for years now . Throwing them out like so much garbage ! " " What  --  things  --  have you seen ? " Lenora said . " Elves ! And fairies ! " Muni and Lero exchanged perplexed glances . " I have not heard such names before , " said Muni . " Elves ? Fairies ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're very cute and very little , " Coren  | explained , " much smaller than you , Muni . And the fairies can fly . " " Oh sure , " Lero said . " And puppy dogs are blue ! " Lenora 's mind was too busy to even hear him . " You know , " she said thoughtfully to Muni and Lero , " the way the elves and fairies are to the trolls must be the way the trolls were to you . And just like you are right now to the big people . And , " she continued , " if we can convince the trolls to bring back the elves and fairies , then all of us together should be able to defeat Hevak somehow . As I said before , the more the merrier ! " Exactly ! " Coren agreed . " I ca n't argue with that , " Lero said . " But I 'll believe it when I see it . " " Good , " said Lenora . " The sooner you see it the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the crowd , and Lero and Lenora shouted to get everyone 's attention . But the trolls were just as reluctant to believe in elves and fairies as the little people had been to believe in the trolls . Given their own recent experience , however , it was n't very hard for Lenora to convince them . Or rather , Coren thought with some admiration , just bully them into it . Soon the whole throng stood around Coren once again , trolls and little people together , eyes closed , all thinking about elves and fairies . As he went into their minds , he could feel the energy gathering , then build-  | ing , building , building . The air crackled just as it did before a lightning strike . " Now ! " he yelled . Once more , Lenora 's mind was filled with strange knowledge , and she made it true . The air was filled with wings , and the ground underfoot was covered with tiny scampering brown crea-tures . The fairies flew about in a frenzy , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delicate creatures dressed in a gauzy material , their wings translucent . There were males , females , even children . The elves were dressed in leather breeches , shirts , and boots . They were hollering , screaming , laughing with joy , doing somersaults , cartwheels , playing little flutes . They seemed to suffer none of the shock of return the others did , but immediately began festivi-ties . Lenora looked around . She smiled . They practically had an army now ! But how could they use it ? Even with so many , what could they do against Hevak 's mighty power ? There were lots of them , true , but they had no weapons , and Hevak was so strong . If he had willed them all out of existence once . . . Oh yes , they had to be careful . They had to think it through , work out a plan . Lenora 's thoughts were interrupted as the hubbub  | around her grew in strength . She looked out over the crowd to see little people and trolls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely , they were n't all getting angry at one another again ? " Hevak did this , " she heard a little person tell a troll nearby . " We praised him , and then he just threw us away , like smelly old garbage . No offense intended . " " None taken , " the troll said , and then nodded as he listened to a fairy hovering and trilling into his hairy right ear . " You 're right , if this is true , we should n't stand for it . We should do something ! " " We should give him a piece of our minds , " said an elf as she jumped lightly onto the troll 's broad shoulders and did a handstand there . " A taste of his own medicine ! " Similar conversations were taking place all over , and before Lenora realized it , the entire crowd was chanting in unison , their fists waving in the air . " Get Hevak ! Get Hevak ! Get Hevak ! " Their army was turning into a hysterical mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lero for help , but they were n't there anymore , nor , for that matter , were Muni and Sumra . She gazed anxiously into the crowd and finally , caught sight of them . They too had venomous looks on their faces and were waving fists in the air as they chanted along with the rest . " Get Hevak ! Get Hevak ! " In the midst of the growing tumult , Lenora saw  | Coren standing , eyes closed , forehead wrinkled in concentration . He must be trying to calm them again . Oh , please , Lenora thought , let it work . It 's our only chance . She stood there helplessly , silently urging Coren on . Suddenly his face went white . He slumped and fell to the ground . " Coren ! " she cried . As she pushed her way toward him , the mob abruptly surged forward , nearly trampling both her and Coren in the rush to get up to the corridor and out of the cave . Before long , Lenora sat alone in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head in her lap and listening to the chant fading in the distance . " Get Hevak ! Get Hevak ! "  | Loren groaned . His eyes opened , and he looked up at Lenora in bewilderment . " I tried , " he said , his voice groggy . " But I could n't do it . They were like one powerful mind . It was just too strong for me . " " Well , you tried at least . But now what are we going to do ? Rushing off like that without any plan how could they ? Hevak will just blot them all right out of existence again . They 've ruined everything ! " " You 're right , " Coren said urgently . " We 've got to catch up with them and stop them . It 's our only chance ! " As he struggled to get up on his feet , he groaned again and nearly fell . " Perhaps I should stay here , " he said miserably . " In this condition , I 'll just slow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " No ! " she said . " You 're coming if I have to carry you ! I need you . " Coren looked up at her , astonished . She needed him ? " You do ? " " Of course I do , " she said impatiently . " How else  | can I know what everybody is thinking ? " " Oh , " he said , gingerly taking a step . Of course  --  it was the powers she needed . " It makes me so angry , " she continued . " If my powers were n't blocked I could fix this mess in a minute ! You know what I 'd do ? I 'd create my own army ! One that did n't just panic all of a sudden ! With machines and thousands of fighting men  --  and women , I do n't see why women ca n't fight  --  and maybe even monsters , scary monsters , spidery monsters with tentacles ! No one could defeat us , no one ! " She shrugged . " But it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are never helpless , Lenora , " Coren stated emphatically , not as a compliment , just as a simple fact . And she confirmed it by grabbing his hand and pulling him up the rocky slope toward the corridor . It was not a happy trip . Lenora pulled a stumbling Coren along behind her , ignoring his requests to slow down . Meanwhile , Coren ignored Lenora 's constant orders to stop whining and get a move on . By the time they reached the upper levels , they were both out of breath and very irritated with one another . At last , the walls of the corridor began to be interrupted by doors they were near the top , and the city was just above their heads . Lenora dropped Coren 's hand and let him slump to the ground . " So ? " she said . " So what ? " he snapped back . " You know ! What are they thinking ? What are  | they doing ? Which door do we go through ? " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet and complaining that he had n't tuned in on the thoughts above . As Lenora watched anxiously , his face changed . He broke into a huge smile . " Well ! " he exclaimed . " What ? " she said impatiently . " What is it ? " " Let 's go up and you 'll see , " he said . He pulled himself to his feet and rushed down the corridor toward one of the doors , Lenora at his heels . The scene that confronted them was curious indeed . It was the same huge square they had come to when they had first arrived in Farren , and it was filled with people , just as it had been then . This time , however , the Gragians were not alone . Everywhere there were trolls , elves , little people , fairies  --  and all of them were very , very busy . Some fairies buzzed around the heads of Gragians and pinched them . Other fairies flew down inside the Gragians ' clothing and they must have been tickling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some little people were undoing the Gragians ' garments , while others just walked up to the Gragians and boxed them on their ears . Still other little people danced around gleefully , grabbing baskets of food from the Gragians and promptly tossing various fruits and vegetables at their heads . 168 ? ? 169  | Trolls were running at the Gragians and bowling them over , or kneeling down in front of them and chortling as the Gragians stumbled into them and fell . And elves  --  elves were everywhere , taking hats from some Gragians and dropping them on the heads of others , tying their shoelaces together , or dumping pots of water over them . Laughter filled the air : grisly troll chortles , elf hoots , fairy giggles . In the midst of all this , the citizens of Farren City stood , or fell , their shoelaces tied together , their clothes covered with food or dripping with water , their pants a tangled mess . But the weirdest thing was , their eyes were filled with horror , and they did nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lenora . " Hevak 's people ca n't see our people , " Coren crowed . " That 's the one thing we forgot ! " At that moment , Lero and Muni rushed up to them out of the crowd . " It 's about time you two got here , " Lero said . " What took you so long ? " " Is n't it wonderful , " Muni said , her eyes glowing . " I 've wanted to do this for years , but I never had the courage ! " " Never had the numbers , you mean , " said Lero , equally excited . " We never could have done all this by ourselves ! Look ! They do n't know what 's happen-  | ing to them , and it 's driving them crazy ! " " Or , maybe , " Coren said enthusiastically , " driving them sane ! " " What ? " said Lenora . " What do you mean ? " " I mean , the block Hevak put in their minds is starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this happening at once , Hevak is losing control of them ! " As Lenora watched , Coren 's words came true before her eyes . A woman suddenly blinked and then looked right into the eyes of the elf who was standing on the shoulders of a troll and tickling her nose with a feather . " Agh , " she screamed . " Monsters ! The world is full of monsters ! " Similar shrieks came from all directions . " Hevak is n't going to have any time to worry about us now , " Coren said . " He 'll have to divert his energies to his people , to stop them from remembering , to stop them from seeing everyone . Even Hevak ca n't do everything at once ! " Lenora watched the Gragians scream and flee in terror , pursued by their army of tormentors . Coren was right  --  this chaos might be just what they needed . She turned toward Coren to tell him so  --  and then stopped . His eyes were full of fear .  | Loren felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his ears . It was coming from above , and he knew what it was . Flying trans-ports . Like silver darts piercing the skies above him , they cruised into view . And along with them came the thoughts of the guards controlling them . They were thoughts of death , doom , and destruction . They were preparing to drop some horrible weapon on the square . " What is it ? " Lenora asked anxiously . " Flying machines ! " he told her . " Look  --  up there ! " Lero followed Coren 's and Lenora 's gaze into the sky . " I know what to do about that , " he said . " Leave it to me ! " He leaped to his feet and ran back toward a group of fairies that were hovering over a poor little Gragian child , tickling him all over . " Hey , you ! " he shouted . " Over here ! " The fairies flew to meet him and , after a short buzz of conversation , zoomed up into the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the flying machines . Soon the machines began to twist and turn erratically and plunge dangerously low over the crowd . Then they swooped upward again , nearly hitting the tall buildings , and then lurched back toward the palace and out of sight . Lero returned , chuckling . " It must be odd to have all your instruments and controls suddenly develop a life of their own ! " " Good work , Lero , " Muni said . " But everything wo n't be that easy , " Lenora said grimly . " Who knows what other nasty tricks Hevak has up his sleeve . " As the Gragians became more conscious of their enemies , they desperately tried to fight them off . It was turning into a pitched battle . As Lenora watched , an infuriated Gragian grabbed a gossamer-winged fairy who hovered in front of him and slammed her down over poor old Peetr 's head , knocking both Peetr and the fairy unconscious . " That 's my father , you oversized bully , " Muni screamed . And she and Lero rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise filled the air . It came from Hevak 's palace at the far end of the square . As Lenora turned toward the sound , the main doors of the palace flew open , and two rows of trumpeters , clad in red and white , marched out and took up positions on either side of the doorway . They continued to play as row  | upon row of guards followed them  --  all bearing weapons , all looking fierce and determined . The guards poured out of the palace in a seemingly endless stream and divided into two columns , one moving left and one moving right as they took up positions around the edges of the crowd . " We have to do something , " Lenora said urgently . " Fast ! " But the entire square was surrounded by guards . They came to a halt , turned to face inward toward the crowd , and simultaneously , as if controlled by one mind , raised their threatening-looking weapons to their shoulders . The crowd was so intent on its battle that it hardly even noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the palace came a strange object , a kind of barge or sled that floated in midair with no visible means of support . One figure stood on it , clad in white . It was Hevak . He stood firmly in place , not even swaying as his transport skimmed over the turmoil below and came to a stop hovering a few feet in front of where Lenora stood beside a trembling Coren . With one final blast , the trumpets grew silent . Hevak stood there like a statue , ignoring the fighting and screaming , his eyes glowering as he stared down from his high perch at Lenora . " It 's you , " he said finally . " I might have known it  | would be you . And , " he added distastefully , " you 've brought along all the misfits I rejected from my perfect world . Well , I 'm sorry , my dear , but I do n't want them back here ! " Suddenly all the little people and trolls and elves and fairies began to flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sticking their fingers in the Gragians ' eyes . The next moment , they seemed to shimmer and began to disappear . How dare he ? I do n't want them to disappear , Lenora told herself . And in an instant , they were back . " Go away ! " Hevak blazed , his glance darting this way and that at the intruders in the square . " I command you to go away ! " Once more they blinked out . And , once more , they returned . " Lenora , " Coren shouted . " You did it ! With all these distractions , he ca n't block your powers ! " " I wo n't have it ! " Hevak shrieked . " I do n't want them . " " Well , I do , " Lenora said , staring up calmly into his face . The wave of hostility that poured from Hevak struck Coren 's mind like a blast from a furnace . " I can see , " Hevak said , glaring at Lenora , " that I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threw his arms into the air in a dramatic gesture . " Let there be  --  monsters ! " he shouted .  | And there were , in the air over their heads hundreds of them . They were spiders , giant spiders with massive bodies , wide cavernous mouths filled with sharp teeth , bulging red-veined eyes , and long slimy green tentacles . They were perched on a massive web that now hung between the spires of the tall buildings around the square , and they immediately began to descend from the web on slimy tendrils . Everyone in the square below screamed in ter-ror . Including Lenora . These were creatures from her very worst nightmares . She started to shiver . " You can do it , Lenora , " an urgent voice said inside her head . It was Coren . " You can get rid of those things . I know you can ! You know you can  --  you just have to believe they 're not there ! Do it . And do it fast , before they land on us ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful monsters were n't there . One of them hovered directly over her head and reached down a slimy feeler . It touched her . It burned like acid . No , it did n't  --  because she did n't want it to . She gathered all her strength and focused it on the monster over her head . At first nothing happened . Then the tentacle touching her disappeared . Then the body , leaving only the sharp teeth and jaws hovering in the air above her . Encouraged , Lenora thought even harder . With one  | large angry bellow , every single one of the spiders winked out of existence . She sighed with relief . Coren threw his arms around her and hugged her . " That was wonderful ! " he exclaimed . " I knew you could do it , I knew it ! " She grinned and felt so happy that she could n't stop herself . She hugged him back , and then went one step further and kissed him . When she opened her eyes and saw the giddy look on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Enough childish games , " Hevak said . " It 's time to get serious . " Up went his arms again , and the troops around the square no longer wore red . Instead , their uniforms were white , furry white . They began to grow , getting larger and larger until they became massive white bears . They flashed their sharp claws as they butted their way through the terrified crowd and lumbered toward Lenora . I would have been frightened of those , once , she thought . But now ? They hardly even made her shiver . She fixed her eyes on the closest bear and watched scornfully as it did as she demanded and turned into a cute pink puppy . It looked up at her and whimpered , then fled and ran , followed by a barking herd of puppies of all colors . Hevak watched their wagging tails as they loped off  | through the crowd toward the nearest exit , then turned and looked down at Lenora with eyes of ice . " That does it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His transport suddenly rose straight up into the air until he stood high above the crowd . " Ready ! " he shouted , and there was an audible click as the guards surrounding the square prepared their weapons . " Aim ! " he added , and finally , " Fire ! " Thousands of tiny but lethal projectiles whizzed through the air toward Lenora  --  and toward Coren ! " No ! " She raised her hand , and the projectiles suddenly stopped in midair . Then , in a weird ballet , they danced toward and around one another , and as Coren and the others watched in amazement , flew upward and joined together to become an anvil  --  a huge iron anvil , suspended directly over Hevak 's head and plummeting fast . That 's some wicked imagination she 's got , Coren thought . I 'm glad she 's on my side . Even from far below , they could see Hevak 's eyes blaze fury toward the descending anvil until , just a few inches above his head , it exploded . Pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air above them , above the entire square , including the guards . Hevak was so angry that he no longer cared who got hurt . Lenora concentrated all her energy . The heat was intense , becoming fiercer and fiercer . Everyone was  | screaming in fear . Flames began to lick at the heads of the taller Gragians . Horrible screams of pain and the smell of burned hair and clothes filled the air . Quickly , Lenora produced a light rain . The drizzle turned into a downpour . Thunder roared . Lightning cracked . The fires went out . Everyone in the square stood silent , too amazed to say or do anything , as water dripped from their clothes and their hair . " And my suit was finally dry , " Goren said to Lenora , a rueful smile on his face .  | Hevak 's transport descended right to the ground . He stepped off and moved toward them through the puddles with a purposeful stride . Coren quickly placed himself in front of Lenora . Lenora could n't help but appreciate his instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him aside and tried to face Hevak without flinching . The look on Hevak 's face surprised her . Anger had been replaced by his dazzling smile . " Impressive , that storm , " he said . " Nimble work . It proves I was right in the first place . You belong here in Grag , with me . " " That 's not what you said when you threw me into prison ! " Lenora snapped . " And those spiders , that fire  --  if you want me here , you certainly have a strange way of showing it . " " I 'm sorry , my dear . I truly am . Surely you realize what a nuisance you 've been ? But that 's just the point . Now that I 've seen what you can do  --  well , it would be foolish of me to send you away , most foolish indeed .  | You belong here , my dear . You 'll realize I 'm right , once you understand . " " Understand ? Understand what ? " Hevak flashed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coren reached out from behind Lenora and put a hand on her arm . " Be careful , " he whispered . " Shut up , " Hevak lashed out at him , " or you 're gone . " " You just leave Coren alone , you big bully , " she said angrily , but as she glared at him , his eyes caught hers , and something happened . She was him . She was Hevak . For some reason , he was making her think his thoughts , experience what he experienced . " Lenora , " Coren hissed inside her mind . " It 's dangerous ! Close your mind . Do n't let him in . " But Lenora could n't hear him . She was Hevak . Hevak the Great , Hevak the Magnificent . He stood in front of a cheering throng , luxuriating in pride as they called out his name . I deserve this praise , he said to himself . Next to me they are like tiny insects , powerless , meaningless noth-ings . And then a shadow of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They bend to my will with ease , even though secretly they hate me , try to resist me . I 'm too strong for them . They 're no challenge anymore . I need a challenge , a new challenge . I  | need new worlds to conquer . I 'll send a message through space , through time ! I 'll find those of strong mind , the discontented ones , and I 'll send them a vision they ca n't resist . And then I 'll bend them to my will . Soon all the universes will be mine ! Ah , Lenora thought as Hevak 's memories filled her mind . So that 's it  --  that 's why I had that vision , why I came here . How could he be so arrogant ? There was more . Now Hevak was guiding her deeper into his mind , down into an earlier layer of memories . He was observing himself in a mirror , admiring his shiny dark hair , his brilliant blue eyes , his strong manly jaw . And as he gazed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are repulsive , he thought , puny . How could I have ever thought otherwise ? It 's upsetting for my people even to look at them . The whole country would be better off if the ugly little things just could- n't be seen at all . As the saying goes , out of sight , out of mind . Hevak is despicable , Lenora thought . Hevak seemed to sense her repulsion . Flooding into her head came more memories , preventing her from thinking her own thoughts . Once again Hevak was looking at his face in the mirror . It was a different face now , younger , softer . Much softer  --  almost feminine . It was feminine , Lenora realized with a jolt.  | Hevak was a woman . I 'm tired of being female , Hevak was saying to herself . They all claim to respect me , these people of mine , but they do n't really . They 'd treat me differently if I were a man . Men always get more respect . I 'll do it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , down through the layers of Hevak 's memory , catching myriads of images of Hevak 's life as a woman and a queen  --  choosing her wardrobe , governing her people , ordering her meals . Lenora caught images of little people mixed in with larger ones at a time when the little people had strolled Hevak 's land as equals . Equals at least to everyone but Hevak  --  not to Hevak . Always she was taking , getting , being the center of attention . And always , she was unhappy , dissatisfied , wanting more . And now Lenora was descending down again , deeper , deeper into Hevak 's memory . Hevak was observing herself in a mirror . Had she spent her whole life looking in mirrors ? She was younger now , only a few years older than Lenora herself . She looked strangely familiar . Who ? ? But her head was filled once more with Hevak 's thoughts . This world I 've made is n't good enough , Hevak was telling herself . I have n't succeeded . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , they all look up to me and praise me . Why should n't they ? I created  | them , after all ; but everywhere I go I see flaws , I 'm reminded of imperfection . It 's just not good enough . I 'll change it all , she decided . I 'll make everyone perfect ! The women will all be beautiful ! The men will all be handsome ! There will be no ugly trolls , no nasty little elves or fairies ! And then again Lenora was sliding down into the depths of Hevak 's memories . Hevak was looking at her own reflection once more . This time , it was n't in a mirror . The reflection rippled . It must be a pool . Behind Hevak was a shadowy presence , a fuzzy image of a pale face , of red hair . And Hevak herself , Hevak was It ca n't be ! thought Lenora . It ca n't ! But it was . It was her own face . This younger Hevak was  --  herself !  | As Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early past . Hevak being chased down a stairway by puppies of many different colors , then being rescued by a tall dark knight , a knight who looked exactly like Hevak himself did now . Hevak cheerfully gathering herbs in the woods with Lufa . Hevak trying out various worlds of her own creations and being punished for it . A child Hevak making the chairs talk , playing fantasy games with a beautiful doll with blond hair piled on its head ; an even younger Hevak trying to fly down a staircase and hurting her-self . These are mine ! thought Lenora . Mine ! My memories ! Not his ! Suddenly , her mind cleared . She felt very unsteady , but Coren held her up . " What does this mean ? " she said to Hevak , her voice shaky . " It means what you think it does , Lenora . I am you . You created all this . You imagined this world , and you imagined yourself in it . You jumped into it , many years  | ago . And you exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became me , Hevak . When I sent a message out for new people , I never imagined it would be powerful enough to go into the past as well as the present . I never imagined I would catch myself ! Such strength , such amazing , wonderful power ! " And he suddenly laughed out loud , a mancal laugh . Then he took her hand in his . " You want to join me , Lenora , my dear , myself . I know you do . I know you ca n't resist . You want to feel that power . Rule a land . Rule with me . " So many things were running through Lenora 's mind that she could barely think . Had all this really developed out of one of her imaginings ? If so , then she supposed Hevak was her . And yet she knew that no matter what he said , he was n't her . She could never have purposefully made the trolls and elves and fairies disappear . She could never treat the little people so badly or send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " she cried . " I refuse to become you ! I wo n't allow it to happen ! " And she pictured him disappearing , first his legs , then his arms , then his body , and finally , his head , the laugh still on his lips . " You stupid child ! " he cried . " Do you really think you can defeat me , now that my powers have grown  | so ? " Then , enticingly , he added , " Do you really think you want to defeat me ? " She did  --  did n't she ? For a moment she hesitated , uncertain . " Do n't give in to him , " Coren said . " I 'm here with you , Lenora . We 'll defeat him together . " " Do you choose that ? " Hevak sneered at Lenora . " Do you choose that over me ? " In the minds of both Coren and Lenora an image appeared , a picture of a skinny , hunched-over , middleaged man , his face pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair around a shiny bald pate , frightened of everything , sitting alone in a dusty room , and wondering if it was safe to eat nectarines so early in the season . " That 's him , my dear , " Hevak snarled . " The real him as he 'll someday be . " Lenora hesitated for only the briefest of instants . She remembered Coren standing in front of her , trying to protect her even though he knew he did n't have the strength . " That 's not Coren , " she screamed at Hevak , " and I 'm not you ! " Hevak 's face twisted in fury . " Then your doom is sealed , " he hissed . There was a pain in her head , a terrible pain , so intense she could hardly remember who she was or what was happening .  | This is it , she thought , he 's sending me into the gray . I 'm going , I 'm But Coren was speaking again . " Lenora , if Hevak was you once , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can defeat him . " He was right . Suddenly , with him saying it , she knew she could . She felt stronger . Power surged through her and from her , like a bolt of lightning  --  and she directed it straight at Hevak , willing him not to be . For a moment , nothing happened . Hevak stood his ground , but then , abruptly , his eyes took on a look of horror . His face contorted , wavered , then reformed again , a younger version . And then that face changed too , became more feminine . Hevak 's life spun backward , unwinding before their very eyes . All the images of himself that Hevak had shown to Lenora in her mind rapidly succeeded one another as the Hevak standing before them grew younger and younger . Finally , only one image remained . Lenora stood transfixed : It was like looking into a mirror . Hevak floated resplendent , her mother 's white wedding gown gleaming , the gold hair ribbon sparkling , her arms outstretched . " Lenora , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " We are one . We are great . We are strong . Oh , Lenora  --  you know what you really want . Join me . Join me. "  | For a moment Lenora 's resolve weakened . How could she kill herself ? But it was n't her . It was no more her than the image of herself she saw in the mirror . It was n't her at all . She reached for Coren in her mind and he was there , calming her , helping her focus . Then , in a final burst of energy , their powers working together , they threw Hevak away . With a last cry of rage , Hevak began to spin , faster and faster , becoming a child and then an infant , until the image whirled into nothingness . Hevak was no more . In the same moment , Lenora felt herself fall . The power that had filled her seeped away and she felt too weak to even breathe . Blackness swam around her and she knew nothing .  | The first thing Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were closed , she could feel someone holding her hand and she knew it was him . But she was too tired to look , and she let the black claim her once more . Again she swam out of the darkness , and again she was aware of Coren . May as well find out , she thought as she slowly opened her eyes , whether I 'm dead or alive . Coren sat looking down at her , and by his side was Muni . No , it was n't Muni . It was Lufa . Funny how alike those two looked , but this was definitely Lufa . That was n't possible . How could Lufa be here ? Where had she come from ? Where were Muni and the rest ? Were they all dead ? Or had she merely lost her mind ? Lufa took her hand . " You 're in Gepeth . You 're back home . And you 'll soon be well . Drink this . " Lufa raised Lenora 's head and poured a sip of strong  | liquid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , gently , Lufa placed Lenora 's head back down on the pillow . Lenora closed her eyes . She was so tired . She drifted away . The next time she awoke there was no one hovering over her . There was nothing but darkness . Had it been a dream then , Lufa and Coren caring for her ? It must have been . This was reality . Hevak had won and she was alone , in the dark . But that certainly is n't what Lufa had taught her to expect when she died . Where was the bright light , her ancestors ? ? And if Hevak had made her disappear , should n't it be gray , not black ? She tried to call Coren 's name but could n't . She was too weak for her voice to obey her wishes . " Lenora ? " It was Coren . Crash . " Blast . Ouch . Do n't worry , Lenora , I 'm here . You 're all right . " She felt his hand on hers . " Tripped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy . She gave his hand a little squeeze . " I 'm sorry , " he continued . " I fell asleep , but I thought I heard you call . " Call ? But she had n't  --  was he reading her mind again ? She 'd have to speak to him about that ! As  | soon as she found the strength to open her mouth . A light sprang up across the room , and then Lufa was standing over her too , a candle illuminating her and Coren . " How are you , Lenora dear ? " Lufa asked . " Had quite an adventure , I understand . " Lenora just gazed at Lufa 's smiling face , then at Coren . " You are n't dreaming , " Coren reassured her . " Do n't worry . Go to sleep . In the morning we 'll explain every-thing . " And then , as if in answer to her request , " I 'll stay here by your bed . Just sleep now . " Lenora sighed and felt a tear trickle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut her eyes and went to sleep . This time , bright light woke her . She opened her eyes and realized immediately that she was in Lufa 's cottage . The morning light was streaming through one of the large windows . She was home ! " But how ? " she exclaimed . She could speak again ! Coren was asleep in a chair beside her bed , holding her hand . He awoke with a start . She stared at her hand , clasped tightly in his . He followed her gaze , then quickly dropped her hand , his face coloring . It was nice , the way he always did that . Lufa entered and waved Coren away , then sat Lenora up and held a goblet to her lips . She drank more of the strong liquid , then fell back on the pillow .  | " I 'm not dreaming ? " Lenora said . " How do I know that for sure ? " " Well , " Lufa smiled , " I suppose none of us really knows that . Perhaps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of . " Lenora started at Lufa 's mild joke . According to Hevak , his world was her fantasy  --  come to think of it , that was probably why Muni looked so much like Lufa . And if her imaginings could be real , then who was to say that her reality was n't somebody else 's dream ? Panicking , she grabbed Lufa 's arm . It felt warm , solid , real . Surely something this solid could n't be just a figment of somebody 's imagination . Could it ? Seeing the anxiety on Lenora 's face , Lufa squeezed her hand and hastened to reassure her . " Do n't worry , my dear . There 's nothing to worry about . It 's not a dream . For now , Lenora , this is reality , yours and mine the reality you grew up in , the reality you escaped from , and now , thank heavens , the reality you 've returned to . " But that did n't mean it was any more real than any other reality , did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Hevak seemed like part of a dream . That last moment " But what happened ? " Lenora asked , dropping Lufa 's hand and turning her eyes to Coren , who was still hovering anxiously near the bed , just out of Lufa 's view . " The last thing I remember was this blast of  | power , and you and I were together , and  --  and ? " Coren moved toward the bed again , smiling . " We defeated Hevak . Demolished him ! And then there was quite an uproar . The Gragians who had n't been sent into the gray had to adjust to all the Gragians who had just reappeared . It looked like it was going to get very interesting . " He paused . " I must say that I was worried about them all , I mean after we got rid of Hevak and you collapsed . I wondered if everyone in that world would just disappear without at least one of you around to will them to exist . " " But they did n't ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once created , they have a life of their own . " " I 'm so glad . " Then a thought occurred to her . " Good heavens , Coren , does this mean that all the other places I 've imagined still exist too ? Have they all got a life of their own ? " Coren and Lufa exchanged glances . " Coren and I have been discussing just that , " Lufa said . " We are n't sure , but well , I think it 's possible . " For a long moment they were all silent as the implications of it sank in . All those worlds . . . Then Lufa tried to hide the worried look on her face by propping up a pillow and helping Lenora to sit up in bed . " But how did we get back here ? " Lenora asked . " Oh . " Coren shrugged . " That was easy . I just used my power . I contacted my parents , mind to mind . And  | then your parents and my parents got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us back here to Gepeth ! " " And when I saw you like that , " Lufa said , " I told them all to go away and leave you to me . You need rest and quiet . I finally got them to agree , even that willful old bear of a father of yours ! They brought you here to my house , and here you 've been ever since . " Lufa leaned over and gave her a careful look , then nodded . " And it 's done wonders , too . Or else " she turned to glance briefly at Coren ? " something has done wonders . I think we might even be able to get a little food into you . " Lenora suddenly realized that she was absolutely ravenous . Of course she was , she 'd really eaten nothing since that gala dinner at Hevak 's palace . " Yes , " she said . " Please ! I 'm starved . Bacon , I think , and scrambled eggs and pancakes . And a big bowl of roast-flavored oatmeal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light meal to start with . Too much food at once would only make you feel sick . Roast-flavored oatmeal indeed ! I 'll go prepare some broth with herbs . " She turned to Coren . " You stay here and keep her company , young man , " she ordered as she left the room . " It 's been three days , " Coren told Lenora after Lufa left . " I was so worried . " He smiled down at her . She smiled back .  | For a moment , they were both at a loss for words . " Well , " Lenora said . " Well , " Coren repeated . Suddenly something occurred to Lenora . " All those people Hevak sent back to their own countries , will they become little dictators , too , do you think ? Are they still trying to make their lands ready for Hevak , right this very minute ? " " That 's an interesting thought , " Coren replied . " Maybe they are . " Then he noticed the stricken look on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued , " surely they 're bound to fail . And who knows , maybe their desire to follow Hevak 's vision died with him ? " " I hope you 're right , " Lenora sighed . " That might help , too , " he said . " You hoping it , I mean . Lenora definitely did not like to be reminded of the bizarre connection between herself and Hevak . She cast through her mind to find a safer topic . " Coren , " she finally said , " do you remember those weird creatures that arrived , there on the hill with all the others ? " Coren nodded . " I do . Poor old Hevak  --  when he called for the best , he did n't get what he expected , did he ? " " It served him right ! Narrow-minded old fool ! But what I 'm wondering is , do you think he made all those  | creatures disappear ? Like the trolls and the others , I mean ? Did he send them into that gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so . Why bother ? He probably just cut off the call and sent them all right back home again . " " Then at least we know their worlds are safe , " Lenora said . " Oh , how could Hevak be so mean ? I low could I " She stopped in midsentence and turned away from Coren , filled with distress . Because there was no avoiding it . Hevak had started out as her . She had created that whole miserable place . " I suppose it means that I do n't dare ever imagine anything else , " she wailed . " I ca n't live without imagining things , Corers , I just ca n't ! " Coren took her hand . " But why should you live without it ? " he said . " That place  --  well , it had its flaws , I suppose  --  but was it really all that bad ? " She looked at him in astonishment . " What do you mean ? " " I hate to admit it , Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really liked . You ca n't give up imagining ; altogether just because things went a little wrong . " " A little wrong ? " " So fine , more than a little . But still , everyone there in Grag  --  the little people , the trolls I bet if you asked them they would n't be sorry you imagined them there . They like their world . They even like one another . Remember Sumra and that two-headed troll , Hulder ?  | They were best friends , until Hevak interfered . " " But that 's just it , Coren . Hevak did interfere . " " But suppose he did n't ? I mean , if you were to imagine Grag now , would n't you do it differently ? " " Of course I would . " She stared at him . " But I wish I did n't have to think about it at all ! You 're lucky , " she muttered . " You do n't have to worry that anything you imagine will become real . " Coren looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " he said . Lenora 's eyebrows shot up . " Wrong ? " " Yes , " he reiterated . " I mean , it 's true I do n't have your power  --  few people do . But everyone can still make what they imagine come true . Sometimes that 's good sometimes it is n't . And , well , you would n't be you if you did n't imagine things the way you do . " He seemed to be actually admiring her for it . " Do you mean , " she teased , " that you liked our adventure ? That you found it exciting ? " With some surprise , Coren realized that maybe he had . Now that it was all over , he could even look back on it with pleasure , sort of . It had been exciting . It had also been very alarming . " Yes , " he said , " if you can call almost disappearing forever or being eaten by giant spiders exciting , then , yes , it was ! Much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisurely stroll in the forest , and smell the flowers , and watch the birds . "  | " I like that too , of course , " Lenora said . " But not as a steady diet . And , " she added , " you do n't want to end up like that picture of you Hevak showed us . " His response surprised her . " Maybe that would have been me , if I had n't met you , Lenora . " Now it was her turn to blush . " You drew me into your thoughts right from the start , " he continued . " You remembered me when Hevak made everyone else forget about me . There must be a reason for that . " " Do you mean . . . ? " Lenora was too embarrassed to say it . She stared at him , and at this moment , strangely , he looked really handsome to her , tar more so than those guards with their perfect good looks . His eyes were so compelling , in fact , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good qualities , " she muttered , not wanting to let him know exactly how she felt . " I do ? " he said , truly surprised  --  he was using all his strength to stop himself from hearing her thoughts about him . " Of course you do , " she said angrily . " You 're very reliable ! " " Boring , you mean . " " And logical . " " Yes , " said Coren , grimacing , " that 's true . " " And , " Lenora leaned over and whispered in his ear , " you 're a very good kisser ! " For a moment , Coren just looked at her . Then he  | took her face in his hands and kissed her . It was as much a surprise to himself as it was to her . " Well , " Lufa said as she walked into the room carrying a steaming bowl of broth on a tray . " Does this mean wedding bells ? " Wedding bells ? Marriage , to one another ? Coren and Lenora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Then they turned back and their eyes locked . " We 're not sure , " Lenora said , staring into Coren 's eyes . " That 's right , " Coren agreed , staring right back . " We 're not . " " Our parents will just have to wait , " Lenora added . " Yes , they will , " Coren echoed . " They 'll just have to wait . " For a moment neither spoke . They just kept looking at each other . And then , right in front of Lufa , they kissed again @x  | here to get married or they 're on their honeymoon . I thought you might fit in one of those categories . " " Nope , " I say and take a sip of my coffee . He sort of nods his head as if to the beat of some slow music and he then says , " Okay , " and he begins to delve into the mountain of confusion that is a mixture of rice eggs hominy and at least five different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile at a time I am somewhat amazed at how he seems to be savoring each distinct taste and yet he still dabs his mouth with his linen napkin in between bites and slowly returns it to his lap . He also blushes after he puts a little more in his mouth than he should 've , and it is clear that he is hungry  --  he eats like a college student who 's come home for the weekend . I am watching him without realizing that I am actually staring but I ca n't help it because what I see before me is a kind of tenderness and innocence I have n't seen in a man in a long time . It is refreshing and sad at once because he is so young and I am wondering when do men lose this quality ? And how do they lose it ? " Are you on vacation ? " I ask . He shakes his head no . Chews and swallows . " I just finished my classes at the university in Kingston and I 'm here hoping to land a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food preparation or whatever I can get , really . And what about you , where are you from in the States ? " " California . " " Wow , " he sings in a very low tone . " California . Where in California ? " " Northern . About forty minutes outside of San Francisco . " " And you like it there ? " " It 's okay . " " And what made you conic to Jamaica ? " " Now that 's a pretty loaded question but it 's safe to say How Stella Got Her Groove Sack 51  | that I just really needed a vacation and I figured why not Jamaica ? " " Do you like it so far ? " " Yep . Everyone 's really nice . " He is gazing at me again with those dreamy eyes and even though he is n't looking through my jogging top it feels like I am sitting here completely naked and he is admiring me and why he is n't trying to hide the fact is beyond me . I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? I lean forward and spread my fingers against my chest and I say , " How old are you , Winston ? " And he says , " How old do you think I am ? " " Twenty-two , twenty-three at most . " His arms are covered with a sheath of curly black hair . The hair on his head is thick and black and shiny and cut close on the sides . His mustache appears to be still growing in but the rest of his face looks like that of a man who shaves on a regular basis . He certainly smells like a man , sounds like a man , and looks like one too . " I 'll be twenty-one on my next birthday . " I nod . God bless the girl who gets to feel those long brown arms around her and those beautiful thick golden lips . Stop it , Stella . Now stop it ! " That 's nice , " I say . " And you ? " " I 'm forty-two . " He puts his fork down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even go there , " I say . " Seriously ! You 're telling me the truth ? " " I 'm forty-two . Why would I lie ? " He 's showing me those teeth and shaking his head . And then he looks at me without saying anything and starts nodding his head up and down as if he knows something about me that I do n't . " You 're being straight with me ? " I nod again .  | " You take very good care of yourself , do n't you ? " " I do n't know . I try . I exercise a little . " " Well , more women should , " he says and I feel myself being seduced right here in the middle of this room . This is really starting to get on my nerves . I mean I do n't need to be at a breakfast table on my first day here with a twenty-one-year-old boy feeling aroused and what have you , because there is something downright inappropriate about this shit . Sort of . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . You 're leaving already ? You have n't even finished your breakfast . " " Well , I ate a little something in my room earlier . And I need to shower and then I 'm going to hit the beach and read a little . " He looks as if he wants to ask me something but does n't exactly know how and then he immediately says , " Are you going to the pajama disco tonight ? " " The what ? " " Well , " he says and sort of starts with that sexy blushing business again that is starting to wear me out and I mean like it is kind of driving me a little crazy . " You 're supposed to wear bed clothes  --  you know , something that you sleep in . " " You ca n't be serious . " " Very . It 's fun . I 've heard some people get a bit risque and wild but you can wear whatever you feel comfortable in . The DJ 's great . You should come , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic power or what ? The way he is looking at me like he is hypnotizing me or something , I do n't think I can say no . " It should be fun , " he says and he is smiling at me again but this is n't one of those regular on-your-face smiles . This young man is smiling about something else . And I 'm trying to figure out what it is . " I do n't know about any pajama disco .... " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 53  | " It 's your first night here . What else are you going to do ? " " I do n't know . I have n't thought about it yet . " " Come on . I 'd love to dance with you . " " Oh , you would , would you ? " " Yes . You look like a good dancer . " " How can you say that and I 'm sitting down ? " " I can tell , " he says and now he 's looking at me like maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell . " Is he flirting with me ? No . He could n't be flirting with me . I 'm old enough to be his mother ! And what could he possibly want from me that he ca n't get from some young chicks around here , like that fox over there , for instance ? On the other hand , he 's right . I came here to have some fun , so why not have some ? " What time does it start ? " I ask . " About ten . So you 'll come ? " " Maybe . " " Would you meet me there ? " " Are you serious ? " I ask . " Why ? What 's wrong ? " He honestly looks perplexed . " Nothing , " I say and feel myself blushing as I stand up . I can see that he 's trying not to stare at me and when he stands up I almost lose my breath and this is scandalous just feeling like this over a young boy but as I back away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see you tonight , Winston , " and he says , " Please do n't change your mind . I 'm only coming because I want to dance with you , " and when I look at him he is doing the smiling stuff at me but this time he has an incredible look of wonder on his face . It is so sweet . As I begin to walk away I hear him say , " Thank you for letting Inc join you for breakfast . " All I can do is nod You 're welcome , since I am now in a hurry to get out of here because it feels like thousands of eyes are on me and I know they 're probably all wondering why I 'm not on the nude beach .  | STELLA , YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF for getting all shook up over some young boy . I mean really . Get a grip , girl , is what I 'm thinking as I walk back to my room , but as I nod and say hello to at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't been this aroused on the spot in about three thousand years . It feels like a miracle , because it means I am still alive inside and not dead after all ! You may think you 've lost it but it 's really just lying around dormant , waiting for somebody to come along and reignite those flames you assumed had long since turned to cold white ashes . Apparently the fire is not out . You are not over the fucking hill yet , you can still How Stella Got Her Groove Back 55  | twitch and flit and flirt . This is great , I think as I run up the steps toward my room , not bothering to peek over at the nudies , and when I put the key in my door , from my tape deck Mary J. Blige is blowing " I 'm Goin ' Down . " I dance on in and as I take off my jogging gear I make a mental note to thank this young man somehow for whatever it is he has done which I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . I shower and lay out all seven bathing suits on the bed and try to picture myself in one in particular . Three of them are two-piece but I feel like a one-piece today for some reason , so I reach for the chartreuse with that magical Wonderbra stuff inside even though I really do n't need it but it gives you a real boost in more ways than one so I put this one on and pull all my braids up into a ponytail and I put on some sunglasses and slip into a giant lemon yellow T-shirt that is really a minidress and I grab one of the ten books I brought with me , my Walkman and my suntan lotion , and I 'm off . It is a scorcher . The beach is packed . It 's not a very big beach , not like a public beach where there are thousands of people and kids . It 's not like that here . First of all there are no children hallelujah because this is an adults-only resort . It is refreshing not to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline with their big potholes and not to hear their squealing and wailing . I admit their laughter is n't had but the fact is if you do n't hear or see any kids you do n't really miss them , at least that 's how I feel after lying on my chaise for an hour or so . I am almost two shades blacker and my skin which is normally an olive brown is getting a little reddish glow to it and I am feeling very tropical already . I would like to get as dark as possible because I 've always wished I 'd been born blacker , so black that I am almost Godiva-edible like the  | proud Africans I love to look at in my big photography books on the coffee table at home . I am sweating and need something cool to drink and as I look around the beach I see a young woman with short braids and a tray full of drinks heading my way . I scan the entire beach to see if I can spot Winston but I do n't see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his height I should be able to see him but I do n't . I drink the second of what will turn out to be probably close to forty or fifty virgin pina coladas over the next eight days and then gallop into the water which is nowhere near cold and I am really freaked when I see a school of at least a hundred tiny silver fish swimming around my ankles . I begin to run , looking down in the water to see if they 're following me but they 're not so I head on out toward the deep part and dive under . I feel like a mermaid or something as I come up for air and go back and forth below until I 'm tired . I 'm grateful I spent the money and got human hair instead of that fake stuff like Vanessa did . When she went swimming , she said , she felt like she was sinking to the bottom because those fucking braids weighed a ton when they got wet . As I walk back toward the shore I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told about the clothing-optional cruise that leaves every day at eleven but I 'm not going on that cruise , not even considering it . Volleyball , which starts every day at eleven too , is more my speed . And even though I 'm afraid of heights I 'm vowing to try parasailing before I leave this island and maybe water-skiing and for sure snorkeling , but I have no desire whatsoever to scuba dive . I do n't want to go that deep . I drink up and spend the next hour talking to a Canadian couple who arc here for two whole weeks on their honeymoon . 1 le is a very tall dark handsome Italian and she is al-  | most cute and very voluptuous and as she lies on her stomach and he wipes her back gently with a towel I wonder what she must 've done to get this hunkster .

Yesterday the color must 've been yellow , because Abby and the other woman who greeted me at the activities desk as well as the woman in the game room downstairs were all wearing yellow T-shirts and khaki shorts . They too are social directors and Abby explained to me that their job is to make sure the guests are happy entertained do n't want for anything have all our questions answered before we have a chance to ask and to make sure we are having a great time which is why Norris and Gillette are on their way over here to solicit us for a game of volleyball . The Italian guy closes his eyes holds his long arm up pushes the palm of his hand against an invisible wall and says , " Not today , guys . I 'm too hungover . " " Oh , come on , Ben , you can sweat it out , " says Norris , who is a deep chocolate brown and oddly handsome , but could use a set of braces and perhaps a baseball cap to cover up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body . " " I do n't think I can , " Ben moans . The other fellow is parading further down the beach and I can hear him giving the spiel to other people . Norris is now looking at me . " Stella , you look like the athletic type . Come on . " " How 'd you know my name ? " He of course is wearing a name tag that says , as big as day , NORRIS . " You met my friend Winston , and he told me he met a lovely American woman and that she was wearing braids in her hair . So what do you say ? " And he holds his volleyball up on the tips of his fingers and begins to spin it . lie is  | looking at me the way Quincy does when he 's trying to sweet-talk me so he can get his way . " Oh why not , " I say . " Oh what the hell , " Ben says and struggles to get up . He 's got ta be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me tonight , Stella , please punch me as hard as you can if I tell you I 've had more than two or three or four Beach Bomb Boombas , okay ? " " Why do n't you ask your wife to do that , Ben ? " " Are you kidding me ? Sasha 's worse than I am . Look at her , " he says , laughing . When I look down at her she is grinning but it is clear that she does n't have a clue as to what we 're talking about . " Play big fun , " she says and drops her head back on top of her rolled-up towels . We play for over an hour and it is big fun and I feel like I 've lost at least five pounds of water . I 'm also starving but ca n't help running back into the ocean to cool off . I dry myself , gather up the book I have not opened and my yellow tote bag with the monkey dangling from the zipper , and head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on a table and go over to the buffet line , which is pretty long . I find myself looking around the place pretending that I 'm not really searching for anyone in particular but I 'm a little disappointed when I do n't see him . I look at my watch . It 's one o'clock . What time does he eat lunch ? I wonder . Stella , stop it . Just what exactly is going on here ? Well , I say to myself , he certainly is a pleasure to look at , what 's wrong with looking with drooling a little bit for a change of pace I mean I do n't want to touch just look but I would like for my heart to thump again which would make twice in one day and to be honest I just want to see if what I felt this morning was a fluke . Who the fuck cares ? Where could lie possibly he ? p 59 " Would you like to join us for lunch ? " I hear Ben say . " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get some kind of seafood and a Caesar salad which they make for you right there and rice and beans and pasta and I 'll never eat all this food I just get it because it feels free which of course it is n't it 's just already paid for . Ben interprets for Sasha during lunch and tells me how he has his own tile company in Quebec and how this is the first time in years that he has taken any time off . Even though it is his honeymoon and not a vacation it was really hard pulling this off trying to get away for two whole weeks because the tile business is tricky and you have to be there for your customers and when I 'm not there things fall apart and since this used to be my dad 's business and business has increased tenfold since I took over it is important for me to maintain my position because things are getting pretty competitive out there and if you lose your edge you have lost your edge . It occurs to me as I watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my job or the pile of work I left and how tall the stack will be when I get home . I do n't care . It can all wait . My boss makes everything seem so urgent , as if the world will stop turning because we may miss an opportunity to make another dollar . I could sit out here and give myself heart palpitations if I think about my job for longer than three seconds but I am right now refusing to entertain the thought which is why I divert all my attention over to Sasha who is smiling at Ben and it is clear she is in love with this man . It is nice to witness . They are going to the pajama party . We agree to see each other there tonight . The sun wipes you out  --  my afternoon nap lasts almost two hours . I decide to sit out on my balcony and read a little  | of The Grace of Great Things by Robert Grudin which sounded good when I read the book jacket in the store but it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach reading so I put it down after a half hour and pick up Black Betty by Walter Mosley which I 've been meaning to read since I read and loved Devil in a Blue Dress but there 's already a grisly murder on page two of Black Betty and I 'm not much in the mood for death . I pick up the hardcover version of Waiting to Exhale by that Terry McMillan which I bought when it first came out and I 've been meaning to read for a couple of years now and after reading like the first fifty or sixty pages I do n't know what all the hoopla is about and why everybody thinks she 's such a hot writer because her shit is kind of weak when you get right down to it and this book here has absolutely no literary merit whatsoever at least none that I can see and she uses entirely too much profanity . Hell , I could write the same stuff she writes cause she does n't exactly have what you 'd call a style but anyway I can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main reason I did n't read this book was because from what I heard a couple of these women sounded too much like me although I 'm not as stupid as a few of them . But I 'm not in the mood to read about a bunch of woe-is-me black women . I sift through the rest of my books , skipping over A Short History of God and The Between which I heard was good but it 's got some supernatural stuff in it and maybe this could work for me like at home but not right this minute and the author 's name is Tanarive Due and she 's young and black and from Florida because I heard about her from the Miami Herald when I was down there and there 's Moo by Jane Smiley . I love everything she does  --  A Thousand Acres did it for nee even before it won the Pulitzer  --  but I do n't feel like going to a satirical college today and there 's Crow ink Over Jordan by Linda Beatrice-Brown though I 'm not  | eager to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery either so I pick up something called Going Under by William Luvaas which sounds about right for some reason and this is what I settle on for the next two and a half hours . I feel so silly going through my suitcase looking for a pair of pajamas to wear to a disco . But I search anyway . The only jammies I brought was my cotton number which is boring as hell but cool especially for someone who is going to be sleeping alone for seven more nights . I did bring one sexy number I got from Neiman Marcus last year that cost me a fortune but I would n't dare wear this because it looks like a slutty wedding gown and why did I pack the thing anyway oh yeah because Vanessa told me you should always pack at least one bewitching thing because you just never know and t hen I come across this almost but not quite sheer white cotton nightgown that has scalloped lace with little tiny pearls sewn in that fall right over your shoulder blades and it has a tiny little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too low and it also has a long sheer jacket to wear over it which has those pretty puffy sleeves you push up to your elbows . This is what I 'll wear . It is soft and sensual in an innoCent sort of way and not too revealing unless I stand in the light and like why would I want to do that ? I take another shower . My third today . And choose a frosty pink Marilyn Monroe halter sundress which of course requires no bra but the cut of the dress makes your breasts look firm and supple even though it is really just a double layer of fabric you are looking at and panties just do n't seem appropriate for this dress so I do n't wear any . At home I go nigh a can of Shower FreshFDS in a few weeks because I can not stand the way I smell down there when I perspire ,  | the reason why , I understand , more men do n't go down on women . Lord knows I would n't which is another reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month depending on how much attention I 'm getting and I do n't care what those gynecologists say about using up good bacteria and increasing your risks for infection because if that 's true then why do women 's bathrooms always smell like old fish ? I 'll be glad when somebody invents a twenty-five-cent douche or feminine wipes dispenser and puts them in all women 's public rest rooms and an automatic Lysol atomizer would n't hurt . I also have my little disposable cleansing wipes which I keep in my purse so that when I 'm out and using the ladies ' room I wo n't have to worry about adding to the smell . I mean , can you really smell too clean ? I let some of my braids or whoever 's braids they are hang down in back and in that ponytail action back on the top . I slip on some low-heeled white pumps and do n't dare put on any makeup since this suntan has given me my base and I just embellish it with some dark pink lipstick and a little eye pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lotion my arms and shoulders and then mist myself with some Calyx Prescriptives which I 'm getting totally sick of because even though I discovered it almost two years ago and for the longest time it was my own little secret scent , now every other woman in America who shops at Macy 's Neiman 's and Nordstrom 's seems to have discovered it , but I 'm not in America am I ? There is no buffet tonight so I walk through the dining room to one of the three restaurants we have to choose from and I can feel people looking at me , especially some of those old white men with their fat wives who are wearing white pantsuits with silver and gold lame and big wide shoulder p 63 pads and little gold sandals with miniature clusters of fruit overflowing on their big toes . Most of the black men here look like linebackers and as it turns out most of them are in the NFL and this must be the spot because there are at least twelve of them with their fine young girlfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of them are really working it and I do n't blame them  --  when you 've got it like that do it like that and hell I give credit where credit is due . I am not envious of these young women with perfect bodies because I used to have one too and all I know is that after they 've had a baby or two and they turn forty-two they better pray they look as good as I do . I hope none of the people I met on the beach or that I played volleyball with and none of those social directors sit down at my table this evening because right now I just want to eat and listen to the band and decide if I really want to go to some stupid disco in a nightgown . The more I think about it the stupider it sounds . But in fact there is no band right now because all four of them are sitting at a table outside the restaurant where I 'm headed and the drummer , whom I remember seeing last night , smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello back and he says , " Having dinner with someone ? " and I say , " No , " and he motions with his hand at the empty chair and says , " Wo n't you join us ? " and I say , " Sure , " and sit down before realizing this is the third time in a single day that I have had companions and to think that my sister was worried about my eating alone ! Maybe they were brought up to be extra polite in Jamaica I think as I sit down and listen to each of the young and not so young men introduce themselves . The drummer of course is the one who has his eye on me and the drummer of course is the least cutest of them all . I am tempted to give him some animal traits but I wo n't because I will probably be struck by lightning for thinking ugly thoughts about someone who  | is only trying to be nice . I tell them my name is Stella and they all first discuss then concur that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bunch says , " You remind me a lot of a girl I know whose name is Zoleta . " " Really , " I say and he is giving me the eye . I am almost ready to burst out laughing because I 'm wondering if these young guys here have a thing for older women or is it that they 're just all very friendly because I have n't been here twenty-four hours and already I 've been in the company of more men who are paying attention to me than I have noticed in years . It is sort of refreshing . " So what do you feel like ? " the drummer asks . " Excuse me ? " " For dinner , mon . " " Oh , I 'm not sure . " " Could I recommend something ? " " Sure . " " Do you eat meat ? " " Sometimes , just not pork . " " Why do n't you eat pork ? " " It 's too disgusting . " " Not Jamaican pork , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So how about some seafood ? " " Seafood sounds good . Is it spicy ? " " Everything in Jamaica is spicy , mon , " and they all start laughing . " Good , " I say , laughing right along with them . " It 's the reason why I came here . " " Why 's that , mon ? " " To add some spice to my life . " " Yeah , mon , " the drummer says and leans hack in his chair and I suppose he 's thinking he 's the Spice Islands Man . When the drink waiter comes I order my staple virgin p 65 pina colada and while I 'm explaining to the band why I do n't drink alcoholic beverages I smell that citrus ocean and as I turn around to look who but Winston is standing behind me . " Hello , Stella , " he says . " Enjoying yourself ? " The band members all look up , then back at me and back at Winston . All of a sudden this feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm having dinner with the band , " I say . " I see that , " he says , stretching these three words out . " But we 're still on for tonight , are n't we ? " and he looks at me with those Phantom of the Opera eyes and I wish he would stop this shit because the blood is rushing to my face and I feel like I just had a shot of tequila which used to be my drink of choice and my God what is that cologne he 's wearing ? " I 'll be there , " I say . " Ten o'clock ? " he asks . " Ten o'clock , " I say as he disappears inside the restaurant where our food is coming from and when I turn toward the band each of them is looking at me like what is this all about ? But then they settle down as if they do know and once again I think this has got to be a dick thang but they really do n't know what 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . I am going dancing . That 's it . " So what time do you guys start playing tonight ? " " In an hour 's time , " the drummer says . " But you are going to the pajama disco , I take it ? " " I 'm thinking about it . " " It 's big fun if you like to get crazy , " says the young one who is staring at me like I 've been reincarnated and have come back as this Zoleta person . " But you look like you like to get crazy , " he says and winks at me . " Zoleta liked to get wild too . You remind me so much of her . You ca n't even begin to imagine how much . "  | " No , I ca n't , " I say . I slurp up my drink and they each have two or three shots of something and I sit there with them but every ten or fifteen minutes I turn toward the door to the restaurant secretly waiting to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dessert and he never comes out . Afterwards I move closer to the stage and listen to the band mostly to kill time even though they are really good but it is only nine o'clock and I am feeling a little restless and I do n't understand this but the next thing I know I 'm grabbing my little clutch and am on my way back to my room where I pick up the phone to call Delilah but realize I ca n't call her anymore . So then I think about Vanessa but change my mind because I do n't know what I 'm going to tell her except that as anticipated Jamaica is beautiful and blah blah blah and oh by the way I 'm being pursued by or I am pursuing a twenty-one-year-old boy who has got me throbbing and shit and I 'm entirely too old for this kind of shit and as a matter of fact I must be out of my middle-aged mind to even be tripping but how could he do this and where did he get this kind of power , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change into my nightgown which seems a little on the long side because it conceals my knees and I put the jacket over it and push up the sleeves and I resemble some black maiden from the nineteenth century and this is n't exactly the look I was after but it 'll have to do and then I spray on some more FDS and put on a pair of flat gold sandals with no fruit on the toes and to kill more time I watch BET music videos until the clock finally strikes ten and then I jump up from the bed and head out the door . I feel ridiculous . I am still not wearing any panties and now I 'm wondering if you can in fact see through this thing and when I walk under one of the pathway lamps and look p 67 down you can indeed see the silhouette of my body which does n't look quite as svelte and hourglassy as I believed it did just an hour ago when I was admiring myself in the mirror . But it 's just too bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standing outside greeting everybody are Norris and Abby . " Stella ! You made it ! We 're so glad ! Go on in ! Have a ball ! " They open the thick navy blue quilted door and when I walk in I am somewhat amazed at what I see . The room is dark but there is clearly a small dance floor which is filled with white couples all dressed in bustiers and garters and thongs and some of the men are wearing G-strings and boxer shorts and bikini briefs . The music is thumping and " Shy Guy " by Diana King is loud and then that beat starts pounding again and just as I 'm wondering if he 's in here I smell that smell and I hear a voice say , " I 'm glad you made it , " and when I turn Winston has my hand and is luring me out to the dance floor in slow motion . He is looking at me and smiling when I he says , " This is my favorite song , " and I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telling the truth and boy oh boy he 's wearing black baggy shorts and a stark white T-shirt . His long legs look longer . Hairier . Leaner . His shoulders wider . As we begin to dance he is looking at me and smiling and then he says , " That 's a really pretty gown you 're wearing , " and I say , " Thank you but how 'd you get in here wearing that ? Does n't look like pajamas to me . " He laughs . " I came in in just my shorts with my shirt balled up and then I put it back on . " " But why ? " " I do n't know . I 'm kind of a shy guy , " he says and I laugh out loud . " What 's so funny ? " he says and he is in fact blushing . I just shake my head and continue dancing until someone  | taps him on his shoulder and he turns to listen and then he turns back toward me and stops dancing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have to go change into pajamas because he does n't know how I got in here dressed like this . " I laugh again . " Look , I 'm just going to run back to my room and change and it 'll take me no more than five minutes . Promise me you 'll stay here until I get back . Five minutes ' time is all I 'll be . " " Okay , " I say and he is gone . I keep dancing by myself which in this crowd does n't really matter . Ben and Sasha are here . She looks like I Dream of Jeannie and he looks like a tall Clark Gable in satin pajama bottoms and when the DJ puts on Monteil Jordan 's " This Is How We Do It " the whole place goes nuts and I see Abby who is wearing the hell out of those pink satin hot pants and a tight purple halter top grab a microphone and yell out , " You want to get crazy ? " and the crowd screams out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder , " Then get crazy and take it off if it 's too hot in here for you ! ! " and on that last note I begin to see garters popping open and G-strings being pulled off stockings falling down thighs to the floor high heels tossed and in a matter of seconds half the dance floor is exposed flesh . I ca n't believe my eyes and when I look down my nightgown seems to be getting fuller and fuller until it feels like I 'm wearing a crinoline slip and a suit of armor or something and I feel old and out of place because I ca n't imagine what would possess me to get naked in front of all these people and twirl and swirl my hips the way I normally do when I 'm wearing clothes and as each second passes more people slip out of something else and I know in another minute or two their eyes will be on me which is the reason why I flee .  | RUN AT SEVEN THIS MORNING AND EVEN THOUGH it 's not scorching like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seal is plugged into my ears at a level I 'm sure the fish can probably hear and makes me sprint for most of the twomile stretch . I reach the end of the beach too quickly so I turn around and do it again . I need this rush . This feeling of exhilaration . I run because it makes me feel like I 'm in control of my life . Like there is no finish line . I slow down to wipe the perspiration away that 's running into my eyes . My shoulder blades are burning from the sunshine . My entire body is actually throbbing so I stop and stand there looking  | at the turquoise water . It is so clear and calm and beautiful that I take my sneakers off and run straight in because it feels as if I do n't have a choice , like something is pulling me . By the time I walk out far enough to immerse my entire body under water , my skin tenses then tingles and accepts the coolness . My cotton shorts get soggy quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few strokes anyway and float on my back until my body temperature has dropped and I get out only to realize that I do n't have a towel and the only way to get one is to walk over by the pool right in front of the entrance to the dining room and I really do n't want anyone looking at me sopping wet but I have little alternative and then I think it 's only quarter to eight now and not a whole lot of people will be up . But before I get my right foot on the top step by the pool , Winston is standing there as if he 's waiting for me . " And good morning to you , " he says , looking indisputably alluring and tall and lean and what is he doing up so early ? " Good morning to you , Winston . What are you doing up so early ? " " I had a bit of trouble sleeping last night . " He is looking at  --  no he is n't  --  yes he is looking at my wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish they would deflate but when I look at his face he is n't looking at my breasts at all , he 's looking at my feet , and I 'm so glad I got that pedicure before I came here but why am I even tripping , I do n't have to impress this boy ! " What happened to you last night ? I came back and you were gone . You said you would wait . Did I do something ? " He almost looks hurt . " No , Winston . It was n't you at all . " " Then what ? " he says , looking up at me now . " ' Those people started taking their clothes off . "  | He certainly looks relieved and then he starts laughing . " A lot of them do that . Some come over from He-do-nism and they have a few too many drinks and.you know ... " " I did n't like it . " He 's nodding his head up and down as if he understands . " But you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know that , but I felt old and out of place . " " You should n't have felt like that at all . They 're just wild , " he says . " I came back looking for you and Abby told me she saw you leave and that you said you 'd be right back so I waited and waited for over an hour but you did n't come . " He is looking at me so innocently I accept the fact that this is n't some kind of a come-on . It is not quite as calculated or sophisticated as the brothers in America could do . Sincerity is written all over Winston 's face and in the way his shoulders droop forward and especially in the way he tucks his lips inside his mouth as if to be saying , You said you could come out and play and then you did n't and my feelings were hurt and I felt silly standing around like that and I thought you liked me . Do n't you ? I believe I am beginning to feel softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued but hold it stop the cameras wait just a minute ! Exactly what is going on here , Stella ? I mean what do you think you 're doing ? Come on ! Get a grip on yourself , girl . " I 'm sorry , Winston . I did n't know what else to do , so I went back to my room . " " But I told you I was coming right back . I thought you wanted to dance with me . " I realize I have in fact offended him . " I did want to dance with you , Winston . " " ' Then could n't you have waited for me outside ? " At home if some guy were bugging me like this I would 've said : " If I wanted to dance with you I would 've  | waited for you but I did n't so how many ways do I have to spell it out before you take the hint ? " Winston is waiting for my answer and all I 'm thinking is how much I would love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around him but instead I say , " I would 've felt silly just standing around in a nightgown , Winston , and why is it so important ? " He gives me this exasperated look , like : Do n't you get it ? and puts all his weight on one gigantic Birkenstocked foot and if I 'm not mistaken his face is saying : Because I like you , Stella , but I 'm trying to pretend as if I 'm reading this expression all wrong because he 's too young and I 'm simply too old to be tripping like I 'm in high school or something . " It 's important , " ? he sighs ? " because we did n't really get our chance to dance . " " Well , I 'm sorry , Winston , it was rude of me . " " No , you were n't rude . I 'm not implying that at all . I was just looking forward to seeing you and I was disappointed when you were n't there . That 's all . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not fine . He looks like I feel when I 'm making love and my partner comes first and fast and then looks at me hoping I managed to get mine and I lie and say : " It 's fine , " but really I am frustrated as all hell and want to do it again until I get to fall over the edge like he did . I am drying . " Well , look , I need to get a towel and go get changed . " He is looking at me in a curious manner out of the corner of his eye and if he only knew how sexy he looks but it 's kind of nice that he does n't . " Are you coming back for breakfast ? " He asks as if he simply wants to know , but he is wearing a look of desire . It 's all over his face . At his age he does n't hide or does n't know how to hide any of this stuff yet , he puts it all out in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming through an open window . " ' I think so . Why ? ' Now I 'm sort of messing with him  | because I know deep down that this young man could n't possibly be trying to hit on me . If I were say twenty years younger I could see it and he would unquestionably be my man of choice . " I was just asking , " he says . " I 've already eaten . " Now why I am feeling let down all of a sudden ? " Have you tried any of the water sports yet ? " he asks . " No . But I 'm supposed to go snorkeling later . How about you ? " " I do n't like the beach . " " And you live in Jamaica ? " " All my life . " " How could you not like it ? " " Just never have . I do n't like the sand . " " Okay . You have a right not to like the sand . " " So how are you spending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm supposed to go horseback riding . " He nods . " You should go very soon if possible . The heat can be unbearable . " " Well , I 'm scheduled to leave at nine-thirty . " " So maybe I 'll see you at lunch ? " " I do n't know , Winston . Maybe . Where are your friends ? " " What friends ? " " Norris ? Abby ? " " They 're working . I wo n't know until Monday exactly where I 'll be , so I 'm just sort of hanging around , helping them out here and there , but I 've also put in applications at Paradise Grand and Windswept . Something should come up . " Well , good luck , " I say as I begin to walk past him , and the right side of my body accidentally brushes up against his arm and in that one second some kind of feverish current penetrates my whole body and in a perfect world or if this  | were like a foreign film I would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and pull his face to mine until our noses touched and I would brush my lips lightly across those thick beautiful lips of his and we would put our arms around each other like we 'd been dreaming of doing and we would begin to slide to the ground and we would be oblivious to everything around us and simply make love right out here right this very minute . " Well , have fun and maybe I 'll see you later , " he says . Let us pray , I say to myself , and wave goodbye . I am the only person on the van going to Issy 's Riding Stable . The Canadians told me that I had better make my reservations early because sometimes it 's hard to get in even two days ahead but it is worth the fifty bucks for the hour because you get to gallop all along the beach and ride up and deep inside the mountain and it is truly breathtaking . I am not exactly impressed by the architecture of Negril as we drive past a packed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with wooden objects and a kaleidoscope of cloth although red black and green dominate and then we purportedly go through downtown which consists of a bank and a small shopping center and we continue past small but brightly painted cement homes and cafes and outdoor restaurants and I was told that no building here is taller than the town 's tallest palm tree which is an understatement . In fact there is not much to see in the way of sightseeing but Negril is where hippies-turned-yuppies have flocked , as they consider it a wonderful reprieve from the hustle and hustle of urban life in America . 1 am dropped off at the bottom of . i dirt road . uul . tm greeted by Issy 's brother who 's called the General , because Issy is a bigshot and apparently does n't do horses anymore ,  | just owns the place . The General looks and smells as if he has been afraid of water for a long time and does not know what deodorant is . As we walk up toward the stable he says , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't smoke and he is disappointed . " How long do we ride ? " I ask . " Two hours . You get your money 's worth , mon . I see to it . You 'll love it . Not to worry . " The stable is ugly and stinks and looks like the set of Bonanza on a bad-ranch day and these horses all look anorexic ; at least six or seven Rastas with long hot dreadlocks are sitting around playing some kind of card game and I can smell that ganja because it is hard not to . They hardly notice when I walk up with the General who has chosen my horse already and his name is Dancing Dan . I sign a bunch of forms and he asks me for thirty-five dollars for two hours and I thought it was fifty for an hour so I think it must be a black thang and I am impressed that they are so organized and businesslike with all the waivers even though nobody seems to be doing anything . The General helps me get on Dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail lined with mango avocado and akee trees . Flowering bushes appear to be taking over the hillside and then we enter what looks like a real rain forest . The trees suddenly triple in size and density ; their branches hang over the path so heavily that we often have to duck . At first it feels cooler and then it begins to feel like a greenhouse : sultry . I am also not exactly National Velvet and when the General begins to gallop I do n't know how to lift my hips in unison to Dancing Dan 's rhythm  --  they slap against that hard-ass saddle and not only does it sting but the breeze is causing all the General 's funk to fly right into my face . " I forgot how to gallop , " I yell out . " No problem , mon , " he says and turns his horse around .  | He explains to me how to do it and then says , " It 's too bad you do n't smoke , mon . " We lope along and I begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some made of several different kinds and sizes of boards and wood just nailed on top of each other any old way . Most of these places have tin or aluminum roofs and maybe one or two little windows and I wonder why they 're up here in these hills out in the middle of nowhere when suddenly I see children playing outside of one and then a woman hanging clothes on a line at another and then right in the middle of the trail a young boy about sixteen has two tin pans of water , one with soap in it , and he is scrubbing some type of clothing with his bare hands and he says hello to the General and asks if he has a smoke and of course he does n't and it is obvious that they know each other . We saunter onward and some small children walk right in front of my horse and hold up an armful of red yellow and green beaded necklaces and I give them a twentydollar bill and they hand me all twenty or thirty of their necklaces but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I do n't want to exploit their craftsmanship and they look at me as if I 'm nuts and then they run off squealing in delight and I put my other fifty back in my pocket twenty of which I had planned to use as a tip for the General because I believe in the power of tipping but only if he stops stopping and posing on his horse right in the line of fire of what little breeze there is . " Do people actually live up here ? " I ask . He chuckles . " Oh yes , mon . For certain . " I am in a state of disbelief because it does not look like more than one person could actually fit inside some of these shacks plus they seem as flimsy as the little clubhouses Quincy and his friends have built down by the creek near p 77 our house . It is difficult for me to accept the fact that grownups with children live inside these huts but I am trying not to pass judgment even though it looks like there might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm sure hoping I 'm wrong . I mean even in Jamaica it is still 1995 , is n't it ? As we pass one after another of these kinds of homes I find myself getting more and more depressed . This is how black people in the South used to live back in the twenties and thirties . I 've got old photos of my grandparents sitting out on their front porches in front of rickety little shacks identical to these . I hate those pictures . My grandparents look worn out . Tired . Like they ca n't do any more have done enough and this is all we get for it , and as Dancing Dan begins to pick up the pace all on his own I am so hot and sticky I wish I could get off this damn horse and sit down under a tree and find an ice-cold bottle of Evian or Crystal Geyser with lime . I pull on Dancing Dan 's reins to slow his ass down because I can see the emerald-green ocean that appears to be a few miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask : " General , when are we going to ride on the beach ? " " Beach ? " " Yes . Some of the people from my hotel said that they rode on the beach and I was wondering how much longer before we ride on the beach . " He laughs . " Oh no , mon . That 's Sopher 's Plantation , not Issy 's , mon . We do n't ride on no beach at Issy 's . We give you the mountain ride , mon , so that you can see the real Jamaica , how the Rastas live . " Shit . Shit . Shit . " But I wanted to ride on the beach . " " You d4D n't like to see mountain life ? " " Yes , it 's fine , but General it 's really hot up here and how much longer do we have to ride ? "  | " Well , you paid for two hours . " " I know but we can cut it short , I do n't mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth and a good deal at Issy 's , right , mon ? " He looks at his watch . " We still have well over an hour to go , but we stop for a drink soon , not to worry . " The General proceeds to point out a number of gardens filled with sweet potatoes and a slew of vegetables I 've never heard of . As I look down at the dry red soil , the General explains why the plants are n't flourishing : everyone is waiting for the rain which will be here for sure tomorrow afternoon and all I 'm wondering is what Winston is doing as Mr. Meteorologist is now proudly pointing out quite a few unfinished brick structures larger than those we 've already seen and he says many of these are going to be big three-bedroom villas but I ca n't picture it . Every now and then he shows me what he defines as mansions which would not quite qualify as a Section 8 home in the hood at home and then I wonder something else . " General ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these folks get home ? I mean we 're like very high up here and these roads are n't exactly smooth and I have not seen a streetlight yet . " " Who needs light , mon ? Everybody knows their way home . No problem , mon . We live ' ere . Some people have cars and some ride bicycles and others walk . Nothing will hurt you here . We 've got Ja looking over us and who needs light , mon , if you know where you 're going ? " Good point . I am ashamed for feeling the way I do but it is hard not to . We pass a bunch of children playing in a small meadow which appears to be in the middle of nowhere and then a little girl with a backpack stops to stare at me like I 'm a freak and I 'm thinking what is she doing out here all by herself ? Further up are more kids , shabbily dressed but clean p 79 and chasing each other around and some are digging something up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a goat ) and they are all laughing and it suddenly occurs to me that these children look pretty damn happy like they are having big fun and I 'm certain they do n't have Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or five-hundred-dollar road bikes or Lightning Rollerblades at home and does n't look like any crack houses or drive-bys or gang-banging going on around here and these kids look like they know how to amuse themselves , something we have forgotten , and I understand they are probably better off much better off than I thought . " Would you like a Red Stripe ? " the General asks as we stop by the fence of one of those little stores is what I guess they 're called . " I do n't drink beer , but I 'll take some water , " I say . To the right about a quarter mile up the hill I see an old black man sitting on a big rock and two little boys giggling . A pale gray horse stands right next to the man and all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no shit , that horse starts galloping down that hill toward us and he looks like he 's going to run into the fence but then when he gets close he makes a sharp right turn and continues on about his business down the trail we were on until we ca n't see him anymore . " How did you do that ? " I ask . " What ? " " Get that horsie to run down here like that  --  and where slid he go ? " " 1 le knows his name , mon . On a good day I bring an apple but he knows when I have one and when I do n't . Come o. ' in for a drink , mon . " Once again the local children stare at me and I smile at them and since there 's no bottled water I get a green bottle of Ting which is a wonderful sparkling grapefruit drink that  | is ice cold which of course means that they do have electricity up here and I am very relieved . The General bums a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different items such as beer and soft drinks and fresh vegetables and fruit and candy and even some household items and toiletries from this little store . A girl of about sixteen stands in the doorway of the little shack that is connected to the store . She looks like she 's going somewhere because her hair is greasy and slicked back and she is wearing freshly ironed old bluejeans and a starched white blouse and she reminds me of me thirty years ago . I remember that make-do look . As I take my bottle of Ting over to where the General is I can see another girl standing in her bra and panties inside the living room of the house , ironing something . Our eyes meet and there is something like disgust in hers for me . I sort of get it , but I go ahead and sit on a handmade wooden bench and drink my Ting while the General drinks two Red Stripe beers . We have the most amazing view of the tip of the island and the view of the ocean is pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe this . I am sitting on a live postcard . Miles of dark green clusters lead down to the bluegreen sea , where I can see fishermen sitting in small boats , waiting . I see coral reefs shaped like navy blue states on a map of the U.S. The sky runs into the water . This is a good place to pray , I think . You would be more inclined to tell the truth from this altitude and someone might actually hear you up here I betcha . Even if I had remembered to bring my camera you would have had to be here to feel this to take it all in because a photograph even a video would not have the same impact . You always lose something when you try to recapture rename what you saw or felt and I am glad that I and here and I will remember all of this without a camera and when I tell people about it I just want to be able to recount p 81 enough of the beauty so that one day they will want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and we sit there in relative silence for which I am grateful and as the two young girls come out of their home and take a tiny little key and put it in the tiny little padlock on their front door and disappear into a clump of trees , I 'm wondering again what Winston might be doing . I guess I look a little perplexed because I hear the General say , " They 're taking the shortcut to town . " On the way back I practice my galloping but it is still too hard to keep up with Dancing Dan and I 'm too hot and I am tired of smelling the General and so when we get back to the stables I am anxious to give him that twenty-dollar American bill and he is happy as hell and I tell him to go buy himself some smokes and I want to say a can of Right Guard would be a good investment but instead I say , " I think I worked up a sweat so as soon as I get back to the hotel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only feel clean but will smell fresh too . " " I do n't blame you , " he says and walks me down to the bottom of the road where the van is waiting to take me back to the hotel . It is lunchtime and in fact I do n't smell so fresh so I take my afternoon shower and put on my navy blue and white onepiece swimsuit and some white shorts over it and head for the beach . I decide to secure myself a chaise first and then come back and have lunch . I have to walk past the dining room in order to get to the beach so on my way there I look inside . Tho white tables are filled with two or three hundred people but somehow in the middle of all those folks I see Winston sitting all by himself and he is simply looking at me saying hello with his eyes . I wave but keep walking .  | To my surprise I feel relieved to have seen him , and to be honest  --  be honest with yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is my heart beating so fast , so irregular ? I get myself set up and see a few of my favorite honeymooners sleeping and slurping and then head back toward the dining room . His table is empty . My heart plummets and I am suddenly embarrassed because now I am totally aware of what is happening to me : I like this boy . I look around as if everyone has just heard what I 'm thinking and I shake off the whole notion by piling my plate with pasta and seafood and forcing myself to eat every drop of it without once looking up from my table to see if he will reappear . He does n't . I spend the next he Jr or so doing the back and forth sun and water thing and then I fall asleep under a palm tree for what turns out to be close to two hours and I wake up wet and hot and I run into the ocean right past a fuzzy-grayhaired black man who looks just like  --  I 'm not kidding  --  the Creature from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is standing in water just deep enough to cover what appears to be a protrusion of extra skin in front of him and I assume he 's blind because of the way his eyes are sort of crossing . " Feels good , does n't it , " he says , and since I 'm the only one in the water I assume he has to be talking to me . " It sure does , " I say and go on out a little further , do a few laps and my underwater ritual and then i head back to what is now clearly a deserted beach . It is siesta time for most of the drunks or people like me who get zapped from lying out in the sun all day . The old man is now sitting on the lounge chair right next to mine and I 'm thinking I hope this motherfucker is blind and it would be nice if he were also p 83 deaf but be nice Stella he is old he could be your father but he is not . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not blind because his eyes are without a doubt now hungrily searching my body for some lost treasure or something . He should stop before I get sick . I grab my towel and wrap it around myself , hiding everything I can . I take another towel and begin to pat exposed parts dry . " Hi , I 'm Nate McKenzie and you are ... " " Stella Payne . " " How many days you here for ? " " Six and a half more , " I say , gathering up my Walkman books towels . " Me too . This is my eighth time here in the last three years . " I want to say , And am I supposed to care ? Instead I just nod . " Yep . Retired from the air force a few years back . Live right outside Pittsburgh but I love it down here . " I am reaching inside my tote trying to find my shorts because I do n't like the way his eyes feel on my body . " You been over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I say , turning toward him now . The first thing I notice are those bunions on his rooster-like feet and then that there is blood dripping down the front of his bow legs where he apparently has cut himself and I 'm wondering ii he 's aware of it . " Do you realize you 're bleeding ? " Ile looks down over his swollen stomach . " Yeah , fell off a bicycle today . It 's all right . Have you ? " " No I have not been to the nude beach . Why ? Have you ? " What is he getting at ? He reminds me of a dirty old man who probably has to pay for all the pussy he gets . As I look more closely I realize he 's not really ugly but far from  | appealing and there is something vulgar about him . I think it 's his mouth , which kind of looks like a fish 's  --  like it stays wet and half open all the time . " Yeah , " he 's saying like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the here and now . " This is my first time at this beach actually . You should come over to the nude beach . I think you 'd like it . " " I have no desire to go to the nude beach . " " Why not ? " " Because I ca n't imagine getting any real gratification or pleasure prancing around in front of a bunch of white folks and dirty old men in particular with my clothes off and besides that I would n't want to give white men the pleasure of seeing my black body considering they used to rape us when we were slaves or did you forget about that little part of our history ? " He wipes his brow as if to say , Damn , you did n't have to get all deep on me . But then , being the whore that I guessed he was , he says , " Why do n't you come over there with me ? " Before I throw up I say , " I have to return my towels and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so maybe I 'll see you later , Nate . " " Wait , " he says , struggling to get up . " I 'll have one with you . Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck . When I get to the pool I am both delighted and relieved to see Winston treading water . He looks pleased when he sees me which thrills me even more . I drop my stuff on an empty chair and slide into the water before the old man can catch up . I can see him dragging his club feet through the sand and I feel bad for dissing him the way I have but not all that had because he should find some young girl out here who needs a little extra cash to ring his bell and I am not that girl . p 85 I am now about three feet away from Winston and I whisper loudly , " Would you do me a big favor ? " and he swims closer to me gradually emerging from the water and wow he has hair all over his chest and his shoulders are broader and wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit like a real man 's and now his face is less than a foot from mine and I can smell that scent again and without thinking I say , " What is that cologne you 're wearing , Winston ? " and he says , " Escape , " and I mumble , " I wish I could , " and he says , " Excuse me , I did n't hear you , " and I say , " Boy , does it smell good , " and then I see the old man and I say , " Winston , would you just stand here and talk to me for a few minutes because that old man behind you but do n't look is trying to hit on me . " He turns to look anyway and then back at me and says , " I do n't blame him , " and I look at him like did you hear what you just said and I say , " Winston , please , " and he says , " What ? " and I look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could walk right inside them and it feels like I am moving closer to him but I really ca n't be sure because now his shoulders are somehow touching mine and this water is getting hot and I see the old man jump into the pool and head this way and I move closer to Winston which I can tell is a mistake because now I am beginning to feel as if I 'm under the influence of something and whatever it is is pulling me toward this young man but I get a grip on myself and say , " What do you mean ? " and he says , again , " Who can blame him ? " and when I look at him he is looking at me for real like a man and I 'm finding this all rather surreal and I say , " Winston , if I were n't in my right mind I 'd swear you 're truing to hit on me too , " and he says , " And you 'd be right . " I let my head plummet under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this and so I blow air bubbles and then I sec his face appear in the transparent blueness and he  | smiles at me underwater and nods his head up and down as if to say yes it 's true it 's true and it 's okay it 's okay and then we both come up for air and I wipe my face and catch my breath and say , " Winston , I know you ca n't be serious , " and he says , " Do I look serious ? " and I look at him and damn is he sexy and it does n't seem as if he 's trying to be , this is simply who he is , and he is looking at me not like that old man with the watering lips but so tenderly as if he would really just like to kiss me on the cheek or something and I swear this water is beginning to boil and I 'm trying my hardest to digest what is happening here and then I hear myself say , " Hold it . Wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says again . " You are serious , are n't you , Winston ? " " Very much so . " " Okay , " I groan , since I 'm in this now . " Let me ask you something . What 's the oldest woman you 've ever been with , Winston ? " " Twenty-four . " And I say , " Well , you 'd have to turn those numbers around for me , sweetie , " and he says , " So ? " and I see he is somber , I mean there is this What is the problem ? look on his face in his eyes , and I say , " Wait a minute . Let me get this straight , " and he is smiling deeply at me again as if he knows what I am about to say and even I do n't know what I 'm about to say but he is clearly ready to respond and I take the first of a series of hyperventilated breaths and force out , " Are you saying that you would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him to see his reaction to that one and without blinking he says , " Absolutely , " and he gives me a Do n't look so surprised look , and out of the corner of my eye I glimpse die old man watching us and Winston pushes his right hand under the surface of the water and I can feel p 87 his long fingers just barely graze my waist and when I look into his eyes this time my body quivers and shudders and I ca n't believe it when I hear myself say , " Okay . " He is grinning fiercely and blushing at the same time and he says , " Really ? " And I look at him and say , " Really . " " You wo n't change your mind like last night , will you ? " " I do n't think so , Winston , but I 'll tell you something : I do n't know what I 'm doing and I ca n't believe what I just said to you  --  there 's something illegal about this , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting look . " There is nothing illegal about this and I do n't quite understand what would make you say something like that . " " Winston . " I sigh . " What ? " He sighs back , and he truly does look clueless . " I 'm old enough to be your mother . " " But you 're not my mother . " " I know that . " " You do n't look like my mother . You do n't act like my mother . And you certainly do n't feel like my mother , " he says . I must admit he is rather convincing . But this is totally scandalous , Stella , and you know it . The waitress comes over and sets one red drink and then what looks like my usual virgin pina colada down by us near the edge of the pool . Winston says thank you to her and offers me the glass . " When did you order this ? " I ask . " When I saw you headed in this direction . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink with you ? " " I did n't , " he says . " It was wishful thinking . " He is looking in my eyes doing that hypnotism stuff again and in order  | to get myself together I turn my head a little to the left and I see old Nate staring at us his mouth watering with envy and I feel sorry for him all of a sudden and when I turn back toward Winston I can not believe that this beautiful tall young man has said he wants to touch me wants to get close to me wants to make love to me and I am wondering what am I doing and did I really just tell this boy that I would fuck him and yes Stella you did and well if I do nobody really has to know it could be our little secret and I 'm thinking he is so sweet and gentle and sexy I really do n't want to just fuck him I mean I ca n't picture us like doing the nasty because I think I really want to make love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him something tender something soft and warm and beautiful something that resonates so that afterwards the next morning or next month or next year he 'll have known what it felt like to make love to a real woman and not like he screwed me or I screwed him like these young hoochies out there who fuck by numbers and think that the harder you do it the harder you come which of course is not true so I am surprised once again when I hear myself say , " So , Winston , do you think you 'd like me to teach you something or do you think there 's something you can teach me ? " He takes a sip of his strawberry daiquiri and looks over the glass and he is certainly not the least bit afraid to look me in the eye , that much I do know , and he says , " Probably both , " and I almost choke because now I ca n't wait I want to do it right now in this pool . " Will you have dinner with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asks . " Is that how you want to do this ? " I ask , shocked because with one of his older counterparts we 'd be on our way to my room like ten minutes ago . ' Phis is  --  he is  --  certainly p 89 " I like you , Stella , and I want to spend as much time with you as I can while you 're here . " " But why , Winston ? " He sighs again . Shifts his body weight and rubs his hands over the top of his head and down to the nape of his neck . " I like talking to you and I find myself smiling so much when I see you and I like the way that feels . " " But Winston . " I sigh . " What ? " He sighs back . " Are you sure you want to do this ? " " Why is it so hard for you to accept the fact that I think you 're pretty and nice and I ca n't help it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you walk into the dining room yesterday the whole place kind of came alive or like the fans started going faster or something but all I can say is you made my day when you spoke to me and you should not be worrying at all about my age or your age because they are only numbers and do n't worry I wo n't disappoint you , " he says , glaring at me in such a way that I believe him . " I 'm not worried about that , Winston . " " Then what are you worried about ? " " Me , " I say , and set my drink down and start heading out of the pool . I reach for my towel and while I stand on the edge old man Nate is clearly looking at my ass and I want to say watch that young one down there and see how it 's really done but instead I look at Winston and say , " What time is good for you ? " and he dives under the water like those dolphins who perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the surface he grins at me and says , " You tell me . " I hold up seven fingers . I he holds up six .  | MAYBE THEY ACCIDENTALLY PUT SOME BOOZE IN my drink is what I 'm thinking as I stagger back toward my room . I feel like I 've jumped inside somebody else 's dream . I mean I know I 'm in Jamaica . I 'm in Negril . I think I just got here day before yesterday but I ca n't be sure because a lot has happened since then and when I 'm at home weeks months can go by and nothing worth noting happens . But yes . I am walking up the path at the Castle Beach Negril and I have just told a twenty-one-year-old that I will have sex with him tonight . Yes , that seems to be what I 've gone and done . I press both hands up to my face and cover my eyes How Stella Got Her Groove Sack 91  | and cheeks and sort of sink at the knees and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my rocker so I remove my hands and smile and continue to walk or float toward my room because I still do not believe I 've consented to something this reckless . But then again , I 'm not planning on marrying this boy . I 'm just going to have sex with him tonight . And that 's it . It 's that simple . Do it and send him on his way . I 've got a whole box of condoms . So what is the problem , Stella ? I mean he is a consenting adult . He wants to do it . But why does he want to do the nasty with me ? I wonder . Because I 'm old . That 's why . He 's never had any old pussy before . That 's it . He wants to do a comparison study . Does old pussy feel as good as young pussy ? I ca n't answer that question and I do n't want him to answer that question but he did n't act like he simply wanted sex , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't he ? And then dancing afterwards , did n't he ? Is n't that like sort of what 's called a date ? But why am I even tripping ? Why am I going this far ? The bottom line is that he is tall and fine and sexy and young and I 'm a good-looking middle-aged woman from America and he 's game and I 'll give him something to remember and if I work it right maybe I 'll get off and I hope the boy can kiss because it would be a shame if God gave him those thick juicy beautiful luscious lips and he does n't know what to do with them and I hope he 's not one of those sloppy wet tongue-wrestling kissers that make you think you 're really in the dentist 's chair and I hope he knows how to move because I can help guide him some of the way but rhythm is something you either have or you do n't have and it can not be taught but I 'll do my best and I hope he understands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown him how to handle them yet so I 'll give him a five-minute demonstration and since he 's young he should  | catch on fast and God just the thought of those smooth lips over my breasts okay change the subject Stella because 1 still have  --  I look at my watch  --  three whole hours to go . Lord what am I going to do for three hours besides go crazy ? I feel like I want him right now but I am not going in that room and masturbate no way Jose I am going to save all of this for him and I feel sorry for him really because I hope he 's up for this . I wonder what kind of music I should put on none of that let's-do-the-nasty music or any begging and pleading or that whining lovesick stuff but then again I do n't want anything too funky and upbeat which means I 'm back to Seal again but I also do n't want to go completely off and act like I 'm setting up this monumental seduction performance because that 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn around and walk back to the gift shop pretending to need only a USA Today when in fact I purchase four of those round scented candles that look like kaleidoscopes on the outside which I place in subtle places around my room like on the headboard on the coffee table out on the balcony and in the bathroom . I feel like I 'm cheating , like this was all premeditated and not at all organic or spontaneous , but then again this feels like the smart thing to do . Besides , he 's probably never had so much ambience . Which is why I feel like I sort of owe him this . As I stand in front of my closet trying to choose the most flattering dress I realize that I am not twenty-one years old that the clothes in my closet reflect this and when I look in the full-length mirror it is obvious that I am not even close to looking twenty-one years old that I have n't been twentyone years old in twenty-one years and suddenly I 'm wondering again why this young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the attraction ? What is his real motive ? I know ! lie 's probably heard the rumor going around Amer- p 93 ica that single women over thirty and black women in particular will fuck anything , since many of them are on that slow track . They used to count how many weeks had gone by since they 'd been laid but now it 's gotten up to how many years has it been and they 're all freaking out because they 're super-lonely and in their quest to find Mr. Perfect for years and years have yet to come to the realization that he does not exist . We who have labeled ourselves Ms. Fucking Perfect Personified have not caught on yet that our perfection is merely a figment of our very own distorted imagination and I should know because I 'm in that forty-and-over club for Emotional Subversives in Denial About Everything . What I do know deep down although I keep it secretly secret is that I am terrified at the thought of losing myself again wholeheartedly to any man because it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart and letting somebody go inside and walk around lie down look around and see all those red flags especially when right next to your heart is your soul and then inside that is the rest of your personality puzzle pieces and they 're full of flaws and in your grown-up years you have just finally started to recognize them for what they are one by one . You 're trying to resolve some of these issues but you 're only up to say number four and the list is too long to get into here but the mere thought of being emotionally naked again is frightening because you remember how fucked up it got the last two or three times out there . Since the world is now aware that women like us are trying to beat the clock , some of us have built this invisible fence around our hearts like those that people use to keep their dogs inside the yard  --  if they go past that invisible wired line they get shocked until eventually they get tired of getting electrocuted and so they sit  | there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just stay put . This is pretty much where I am : putting , and lots of my girlfriends are too because this is the big easy that I hope Winston has n't heard about but then again I 'm sure if they get BET down here they must get Oprah too . The only thing I 'm hoping is that if he is on this kind of sympathy mission , he realizes women like me are not really desperate . Getting laid is hardly a problem  --  almost any man ' 11 take some free pussy  --  but getting laid by somebody you want to get laid by is an entirely different issue . When we finally meet somebody we do want to lie down with we are n't feeling desperate  --  what we 're feeling is vulnerable , nervous and scared . Big difference . Big big difference . But once again , Stella , you are like getting far too deep here for somebody who is planning to have a little sexual encounter with a boy for one single evening so like could you spare me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in particular in America , okay , and let 's just get us some nuggies and hope it 's good and get on with this vacation ? Can we do that ? Okay , so this mental masturbating kills a whole hour . I decide that reading is a good time-passer so I pick up a book without looking at the title and begin to read the words one at a time instead of in groups like I learned to do years ago in that Evelyn Wood speed-reading class that never quite worked for me except the grouping stuff . It is not working now . I lay the book down and decide that the best thing for me to do is rest since I 'll be expending and I hope consuming a great deal of energy tonight . I call the operator and ask for a wake-up call at five just in case I doze off and I get under the covers and everything and start thinking about oh my ( ; od what if people see us what arc they going to think and say ? Shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is America . No it is n't America . Okay . This is the nineties and oh go to sleep girl and then I turn my attention to those waves that are still at it outside my window and I push my face deeper and deeper into the soft white pillow and close my eyes for a few minutes and when the phone rings I am startled . The operator claims it 's five o'clock and when I look at my watch it is . May as well put the video camera on fast forward because that 's how quickly I jump out of bed take a shower shave my underarms and legs douche pumice-stone my heels elbows knees brush my teeth pluck a few hairs from my eyebrows put some Visine in my eyes pull my cool braids to the other side of my head and rub my Calyx lotion everywhere on my body that 's brown . I do that minimum makeup routine again because to be honest I ca n't stand all that mess on my face and the other reason is because I always want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees is what he gets . I stand in front of the closet again since I never did decide on what to wear and realize I have quite a few Marilyn Monroe  --  type dresses and that I am not a reincarnation of Marilyn thank the Lord and yet I also do n't want to repeat myself and plus I do n't want to look like I ca n't wait to get out of this dress but I also do n't want to look like I 'm a chaperone at my son 's prom either not that I brought anything like that so I choose a soft yellow linen shift that has a low neckline in front and back and comes right above my knees but it fits snugly and makes me look like I have a real figure even though I really do n't well what I have is narrow hips and a firm set of curvy glutes aka a big ass which runs in my family and I 'll tell the truth I do n't want to lose it ever . I put on my twenty-two-dollar strapless bra I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts without smashing crushing them down or upping them two sizes and it  | actually g gives me that ever-so-light touch of cleavage I 'm seeking bunt only if you look from the side . I slip on my mustard sling-back pumps some gold hoop earrings and when I look in the mirror I think I 've got it going on , t 00 be honest . I just hope he thinks so too . I hope he has n't changed his mind . What if he 's changed his mind ? What if h-e 's come to his senses and is hiding in his room and I go out - there all dolled up and do n't see him and I 'll feel stupid ? 1'This is the reason why I often hate men . They 're all alike . You ca n't depend on them for shit . They 're weak . I do not for the life of me understand why God even gave them balls NA  --  wen most of the time they act like they do n't have any . I car't see that this weak-acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , I am making a mental note right now to teach Qu-tincy how to grow up and flex his balls as much as possible , to jump into the fire to take risks and even if you 're scared do the shit anyway . I do n't want him to act like a little pussy likxe this Winston like his daddy like so many of these fellows rrunning around in the world who do n't deserve to be called men . What some of them most of them a lot of them redly need is a month or two at a dude ranch run by women . We 're the ones who can show these simpletons how to be men because we raised them and for some reason perhaps they are all suffering from ADD because they have appare n- tly forgotten most of the necessary valuable constructive stuff we taught them as young boys which is why most of - them are in dire need of a refresher course today . I pick up my little clutch and walk to the dining room with a : serious attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to run into him and he 's like say witib some young hoochie I will just give him my vampire look like I 'll get your ass later when you least expect it for setting me up like this and what exactly did you think p 97 you could do for me anyway ? You probably have never even had any real pussy , have you , Winston ? Probably never even spent the night out except at a sleepover , huh ? There he is . Sitting on the bench outside the dining room . And he 's alone . He stands up when he sees me and heads my way and wow does he look more handsome this evening or what and ohmyGod he 's wearing that Escape again and I am so glad I did n't wear panties which is becoming a habit for me down here but maybe I should 've this time because where will this stuff go that 's trickling down my leg oh shoot but thank God I have my little wipes in my purse so right after he says " Hi " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you excuse me for a second , I need to go to the ladies ' room , " and he says , " Are you okay ? " and as I amble away like they do in the movies I say , " I 'm fine , just had a little accident but it 's nothing really , " because I surely do n't want him to think I 'm on my period because he 's so young and everything and he probably no way would want to do it the very first time if I 'm on my period even though I know men who will go down on you when you 're bleeding which I think is disgusting and I ca n't even bear to watch them when they do it and do n't come up here acting like you want to kiss me now no way go brush and floss and Listerine and then come back and let me smell your breath first and we 'll consider another kiss then but not until then . I am ashamed of myself for getting so worked up so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like this feeling and I 'm thinking I wish I could call Delilah to tell her what I 'm up to  --  she would probably just say , " Go for it , girl ! " Do n't want to call Vanessa because she 'll probably make me feel even sillier than I already do and Angela would probably scold me and tell me I 'll be struck by lightning for even thinking about doing something like this so I clean up my  | act and come out of the stall and blot my lips and say , " To hell with both of you , " and since nobody 's really looking I actually giggle as I head back out where Winston is still standing in the very same spot . His hair is jet black shiny and brushed back on top and I can see his scalp on the sides where it 's cut very close and he has a gold hoop in his left ear and he 's wearing a real button-down-the-front shirt that 's not at all tropical-looking but looks as if it could 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store and not where the hip-hoppers shop either and I ca n't tell if it 's purple or brown in this light but it has some kind of speckles on it that look like the solar system or galaxies and I 'm so glad he has on bluejeans because I love the way he looks in them like he does n't care that they do n't exactly fit but they certainly look good on him and God his legs just go on and on and he is wearing these black suede bucks and I like his style his taste the decisions he 's made and damn is he beautiful but what 's weird is that he does n't carry himself like he 's all that handsome ; he stands moves as if he 's just sure of himself as if he knows who he is but he just does n't know his own power yet . I am so glad . " Is everything okay ? " he asks with real concern in his eyes . " Fine , " I say . " Are you hungry ? " he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles blushes and shakes his head from side to side . Hey . He 's got dimples ! When did he get those ? " We should eat though do n't you think ? " I say . " We can at least try , " he says and then we both start laughing almost uncontrollably and I think we both know why we 're laughing . " Winston ? " p 99 " Yes , " he says and there he goes looking at me again but this time it 's like real laser-like desire is emanating from his eyes and boy is it penetrating this little area in my chest that feels just like my heart and I wish he would like stop this . " Did you just have to wear that cologne ? " " I thought you liked it . " " I do . That 's the problem . It 's making me feel dizzy . " " Did I put too much on ? " he asks . " No , I do n't mean it that way . " And he looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never mind , " I say . " You feel like eating some pasta ? " he asks and I kind of crack up because he says it like " pesta . " " Sure , " I say and we walk through the dining room , where Norris and Abby and all the rest of the social directors and all the honeymooners and the folks from the van and the ones I lie out on the beach with including old man Nate all wave to us as we walk by . I should not be doing this out in the open , I think . " Why are you in such a hurry ? " Winston asks . " Am I ? " " Yes , you sort of sped up for some reason . What 's wrong ? " " Nothing , " I say and sit down at an outdoor table . " Tell me what it is , " he says , leaning forward , and when I look into his eyes I ca n't remember what I was going to say but then I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this because if you want to back out if you want to change your mind it 's okay you wo n't hurt my feelings because I 'm a big girl a grown-up really and I 'm used to disappointment so if you 're having second thoughts we can just eat dinner and maybe dance a little bit and say good night and he done with it no hard feelings . " His eyes are wide and he looks like he ca n't believe what  | I just said . " Could you repeat that word for word , please ? " And he leans back against his chair and waits . I am embarrassed no end . " You know what I meant . " " Stella ? " I can not look at him . " Stella ? " " What ? " I say but I 'm still not looking at him . I am feeling like I 'm in fucking high school when in fact I could be the damn principal . " I have n't changed my mind . I have been unable to think clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in my head . I am not afraid , Stella . I am not afraid of you . I am not afraid of what is happening . I am not afraid of what might happen . And I will be honest with you . I have n't been this excited about a woman in . . . well , never . " I can hardly swallow even though I have nothing in my mouth to swallow because my mouth is past dry . " I 'm really flattered , Winston . " " I 'm not saying it to flatter you . It 's the truth . " " I 'm still flattered . And I 'll tell you , " I say and sigh , because I hear myself say , " Winston , even though I think this is kind of ridiculous I want you to know how much I like you too and ? " " What 's ridiculous ? " I 'm trying not to let my eyes roll up in my head . " Do you want me to say it again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Winston , I just want you to know that I 've never done anything like this before in my life . " " What do you mean by anything like this ' ? " " Well , a few things . First of all I 've never gone on a vacation and picked up a man that I do n't even know . " " You have n't picked me up , Stella . " " You know what I 'm saying . " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 1 O1  | He is beginning to look a little offended so I decide I better clean it up because I did n't mean that I was picking him up like some prostitute or something . " Well , you know , what I really mean is this , Winston . It 's the nineties , the age of safe sex , and folks do n't usually go jumping into bed with strangers anymore . " " Do I feel like a stranger to you ? " " Well , no . But I just met you yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird . " " I 'm more than willing to tell you anything you want to know about me . Just ask me . " " Okay . Tell me about your parents . " " Well , my dad 's a surgeon in Kingston and my mom 's an RN . I have two older sisters . Both are married . I grew up outside Kingston and went to private school and have done two years at the University of the West Indies in Kingston where I was studying biology but I did not like it which is why I took a course in food preparation and am considering perhaps studying hotel management or becoming a real chef I 'm not sure even though my dad does n't want me to do either . There . So now you know everything about me . " When I heard him say " my dad " I was tickled enough to giggle but I decided it would be in poor taste and plus I should n't hold his age against him . It is n't his fault he 's only twenty-one years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he has told me everything about himself is downright touching . " Well , thanks for sharing , Winston . " 1 le does n't get it . " What else did you want to tell me ? " he says . " Well , Winston , I ca n't seem to remember now , which means its not all that important . " A waitress appears and gives me a go-girl smirk and I look at Winston and realize that we are like out in the open and Lord what am I doing ? " Do you know what kind of  | pesta you want ? " he asks me and I spot something on the menu and point it out to our waitress and Winston says he 'll have the same thing and she takes our drink order and of course I ask for my virgin pina colada and Winston who also does not drink orders his virgin strawberry daiquiri . " So what should I know about you ? " he asks and leans forward on his elbows . " I like your shirt , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm listening . I mean I have shared my deepest secrets about my personal being with you and now I 'm waiting to hear yours . " " Well , I 've been divorced for three years . " " Do you presently have a boyfriend at home ? " " No . " If I 'm not mistaken he actually looks relieved and then he looks at me like he 's on his way to another level or something . " Why not ? " " Because it 's hard to find one I like . " " Why is it so hard ? You 're quite attractive . I would think men would be swarming around you . " " Swarming ? I do n't think so , Winston . First of all , looks can only get you so far and , well , I 'll put it this way . I 'm also kind of picky . Maybe too picky but I do date and may I continue , sir ? " He is smiling and nodding at me . He looks almost edible . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love dearly and he 's my best buddy . " " That 's nice to hear , " he says . " And I turn tricks for a living . " " Tricks ? What kind of tricks ? " " I 'm just kidding , " I say . " I 'm an analyst for a securities company .. , p 103 He looks confused and who can blame him ? " It only sounds good but in essence my job does n't make a whole lot of sense and I would n't be surprised if in the next few weeks computers will have taken over . " " And what exactly does an analyst do ? " he asks . " It 's kind of hard to explain but basically when people or I should say in my case businesses and cities and universities and the like want to invest their profits to make more money I basically analyze all the different areas and avenues and give them advice on where it looks like their money 'll grow the fastest and the safest . " " Ohhhhh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And do you like doing all this ana-lyzing ? " " I used to , but the thrill is gone . Been gone . It 's okay , though . It 's a living . " " And you studied many years to learn to do this ? " " Yep . New York University . Bachelor 's and master 's . " I do n't even want to mention my M.F.A. " Right . " He sighs as if he 's putting this all together and then he looks me in the eye and says , " Well , it seems to me that if one goes to college for so many years you 'd at least end up working in some field that you derive a great deal of pleasure from . Do n't you think ? " " Of course I do , Winston , but sometimes your attitude changes , your needs and values change , as you get older , and what used to excite you does n't anymore . " " So do you have this same attitude toward people when your attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean when you get bored or someone wears out their welcome do you treat them like you would your job ? Do you just kind of settle in or do you look for a new one ? " I ) amn . I take a deep breath . He certainly does n't sound or  | think like he 's only twenty-one . And he 's not fidgeting or acting hyper and as a matter of fact I 'd say he 's more poised than I am . I 'm even more surprised by what he 's saying because it means he 's measuring what he sees , he 's trying to see if all the pieces fit , and this is refreshing . " Well , I 'm the type that sort of hangs in there until I 've exhausted my resources and when I realize I 've given it my best shot I move on . But this can sometimes take a while . " He 's nodding his head when they bring us our pesta and salad and we both instinctively seem to want to lighten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and chew heartily as if we 're actually tasting it and then we lay our forks down and it 's only a few minutes after seven and it 's obvious we are both nervous but trying to pretend like this is a normal date but we know it is everything but that and maybe we should 've stuck to seven instead of six because the disco does n't open until ten but what we do is basically sit outside the dining room and listen to the band . Of course that drummer is staring at me and Winston from across the dining room because I can see his beady little eyes glisten and the other one , the young guitar player as he turns out to be , is looking at me like I 'm still a reincarnation of his old girlfriend but Winston and I go and sit on a chaise by the pool and listen to the waves and the music and just talk about Jamaica and America and then we go for a walk but not on the beach because those stupid sand fleas arc out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and particularly your ankles and especially if you 're wearing perfume they love perfume they bite you so hard you do n't feel it until moments later when you begin to scratch and then it is uncontrollable and you really could cry but you think that if you just scratch hard enough it will go away but it does n't and all you see is red and it is blood and p 105 so you have to rub that cream on and it does n't help all that much which is why Winston and I agree to walk over to Hedonism where they are having a Hunk Show Contest and we sit there in their open dining room/bar and watch twenty young men from all over the world model suits shorts and swimsuits . They are all gorgeous and buffed and I am surprised that people have their clothes on because it 's not what I was told they did over here and of course and under normal circumstances I would probably be screaming at these guys like everybody else is but they just do n't seem to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has and he 's not at all an exhibitionist and he certainly could be which is why I feel like the lucky one I really do . On the walk back he takes my hand and places it inside his and really grasps it and I am not kidding I am getting chills and goosebumps all over my arms and they seem to be running down my back as if somebody 's tickling me but then his hand becomes warmer and I seem to be squeezing it tighter and we walk back onto the grounds of the Castle Beach Negril and the band is packing up and so we go into the disco and the DJ is playing some pump-to-the-bump music and Winston and I do n't bother to sit down but head out to the crowded dance floor where we will dance for the next two hours and where I will get drunk watching how suave and smooth he moves , unlike some twenty-one-yearolds who are rather wild but not him he moves in an unrehearsed way as if he is feeling the music and it is what is dictating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't do so bad myself I just do n't do the latest dances because I do n't care but then the DJ plays this hold-me-in-your-arms kind of song and in slow motion Winston sort of like automatically pulls me close to him and puts his arms around me and we rock in one small spot and I go ahead and  | put my arms around the small of his back and he is nice and narrow and I feel like I 'm really starting to spin the way that girl does with John Travolta in that Staying Alive movie and Winston smells so good and his chest is firm and his arms are so long and they are making me feel like I 'm inside something good something warm safe go ahead and relax enjoy him Stella it 's okay and his shoulders are so wide and I am looking at this hair sticking out above the V in his shirt and he smells so good and he feels so good and I hope this song lasts for at least another hour and I swear when I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and away from him a little bit and looks down at me and smiles and then kisses me on my forehead I feel like I 'm on some kind of drug that causes euphoria because I am like floating right now but when he starts to pull me back against his chest and holds me as close as I can get but as softly as he can I finally realize that Winston is not at all a boy that he is not my toy for the night he is in fact a real man . It is now about twelve-thirty and the dance floor is empty with the exception of me and Winston . I think we not only have enjoyed dancing together but have both been stalling because we are kind of scared . But scared or not , the place will be closing soon and we have to get out of here and besides I 'm not that scared really I want to do this so on a Warren G song I take Winston by the hand and say , " Are you ready to go yet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thought you wanted to dance more , " and I shake my head back and forth and we both smile and he takes my hand as we walk through the game room and out to the path that leads to my room and when we get there I open the door and walk in first and then I really feel like I 'm in high school because I ca n't remember what I 'm supposed to do next . My heartbeat is way over my heart rate zone and if I had p 107 my monitor on it would 've been beeping for like the past two hours . I am not a stranger to seduction it 's just that I 'm used to being the seducee and not the seducer but I can do this I can show him what to do , so after I press on Seal of course I turn to him and say , " Have a seat , Winston , " and he sort of walks over to me all tall and everything and puts his arms on my bare shoulders and bends down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are really beautiful , " and before I can answer I feel something warm and heavenly land on my lips but this ca n't be right this ca n't be oh God what is he doing he is pressing his lips against mine so softly that I am feeling like one of those velvet paintings and oh no he 's not supposed to be able to make me feel like oh God he is kissing me like he has been wanting to do this for a long time but he is not frantic he is not pressing in hard and now his lips are whispering they are just barely brushing mine and please do n't stop Winston I have been waiting a long time for a man to kiss me like this like he means it and who taught you how to wait a minute hold it stop I say in my head and push him away for a minute . " What 's wrong ? " he asks . I want to say do n't you get it ? You are like kissing me like you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where my weak spots all are and your kisses are reducing them to nothing I am losing my strength but please kiss me again because you feel like what I need what 's been missing like I 've been waiting years all my life to have your lips touch mine like this , but all I say is , " Winston , your kiss is ... " " What ? " He looks worried and I realize I am over-reacting . " I did n't expect this . " " What ? "  | " For you to be such a good kisser . " " You 're the good kisser . " " No . You 're the good kisser and it 's making me weak . I wish I could but I ca n't lie about it . Look at me , " I say and I feel like he must surely be able to see steam coming from my entire body or at least he can see how I 'm disintegrating into a vapor . " Feel my heart , " he says and places my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It feels you , " he says . " I want you to take advantage of me , " I hear myself say . And he looks at me as if to say you 've got this all wrong it is not about taking advantage of you and then he kisses me again and I am turning into mush inside and I have n't felt this in a gazillion years since maybe college and I feel like I could cry because I 've been waiting to feel this magic I 've forgotten how the magic feels and I 've been waiting for him I have read about the power of a kiss but when he puts his tongue in my mouth he is not frantic he is slow-dancing with mine he is sending me a message and I 'm getting it he is telling me a story and I am loving every word and when he holds me tighter he is telling me he wants to be closer can I get closer and so I wrap my tongue around his as if I 'm trying to protect it from something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it is not just the kiss that is moving me it is you the kisser the man behind the kiss and I have no choice I shift my shoulder blade under his armpit so as to feel like we are inside each other but he already knows that I ca n't get close enough to him and because he is helping me find a position where we will be able to blend once and for all and because it is impossible in what feels like slow motion we begin to search explore chins ears elbows eyebrows arms fingertips wrists but always back to our lips where something passes from him to me and me to him and we are p 109 spinning now and my lips feel like a hot peach between my legs feels like a hot peach and Winston please do n't stop because I do n't care that it 's a cliche but I feel like a butterfly and I do n't want you to stop making me flutter but he kisses me on my cheek and I kiss him on his cheek and he rubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you okay ? " and it is difficult for me to answer that question because I am trembling now I mean really trembling and I can only nod and he says , " Are you sure ? " and I say something stupid like , " Is n't it hot in here to you ? " and he takes those hands and brushes over my braids and holds me again until like three more Seal songs play and I swear I 'm about ready to cry for real and if I knew him better I would and when I feel him unzip my dress I am scared but he does it so delicately so gently that I do n't even realize I 'm standing there in my strapless bra and no panties and he holds me to him again and rubs his hands up and down the back of my body and he says , " You certainly do n't feel like I 'd expect any forty-two-year-old woman to feel , " and I say , " But I am , " and he steps back and looks at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you do n't look like any forty-two-year-old woman I 've ever seen , " and I say , " But I am , " and he says , " Well , you feel better than any twenty-year-old girl , " and I say , " But I 'm not , " and he says , " I know and I 'm glad and you are so sweet and so lovely and Stella if we just stand here for a while would that be okay with you because I love the way you feel like this and I just really want to take you in , " and I am really slipping away here by the second but I say in a little tiny voice , " Okay , " and he holds me even closer so that I feel a heartbeat in his belly I can feel the hair on his belly brush against sink into my belly it that 's possible until somehow it is minutes or it could be hours later and we are lying next to each other on the bed  | and somehow we have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and he is still moving so very slowly and I 'm so very glad that he 's not rushing and if I 'm not mistaken it feels as if he knows exactly what he 's oh my God those lips are on my breasts oh God he 's kissing them the right way and somebody please help me where did he come from please do n't stop and oh please do stop before I scream but now his mouth is back against mine and I hear him unwrap his condom and he whispers in my ear , " Is it okay now ? " and I 'm thinking he is so polite he is certainly a considerate one and my answer is a light kiss and when he finds his way in he helps me glide and he guides me to his beat which is so slow and undulating and I feel him hold on to me until we are moving like those waves outside the balcony and I am lost at sea until I feel him squeeze me as if I 'm falling overboard and he whispers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself succumbing surrendering to him and I say , " Win-ston , what are you doing to me ? " and he sighs and whispers , " Oh Stel-la , why are you doing this to me ? " and I say , " What ? " and he moans , " Stel-la , " and I am feeling like hot foam and I moan and sigh , " Win-ston , " and we both squeeze each other as if we have been looking for each other for a long time and when we rest our heads against each oth-er 's wet skin the only thing I think we understand is that this is where we 've always wanted to be and now we are here .  | WHEN I WAKE UP HIS AROMA PERVADES NOT ONLY my pillows but the whole room . He was definitely here , I think . I t was not a dream . No . It was real . He was real . I shower in lukewarm water and decide on thick white running shorts and matching top which I put on in slow motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushion as I jump two And three steps at a time and head toward the beach . This morning I seem to float along the shore , as if my feet do n't feel the sand at all . The sun has just barely risen and yet the sky is already royal blue and there are absolutely no clouds whatsoever . The ocean is serene , no waves . I ca n't believe it as  | I walk into the water with my sneakers on and see a society of silver fish swimming around my ankles . They are so beautiful that I stand there watching them for a long time . I can feel the heat from the sun on my shoulders as I walk back to the beach , take my sneakers and socks off and sit down on the sand . I am the only one out here . It is my beach . When I look out at the ocean where it drops off and disappears it feels as if I could run on top of the water to the very edge and what I would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel right now . As if somehow in the middle of the night my soul was visited by something divine something  --  I do n't know  --  but whatever it was and whatever happened I feel different today than I did yesterday . Lighter , as if a breeze could go right through me . Amazing . And then I think I smell him . I turn to look and he 's not there and I can only smile . And to think . I did n't have to teach him anything . I told him so before he left . " I did n't have to teach you anything , Winston , " and he sort of chuckled and said , " Oh yes you did , " and I said , " What ? " and he said , " I 've never felt such tenderness before , and boy , " he said with a sigh , and he was about to say something else but he just rolled me back over on top of him and I kissed him gently and said , " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " You can , you should , I would like that , " and then I heard myself say , " Do you have a girlfriend ? " and he said , " No , " and I found that a little hard to believe and so I said , " Why not ? " and he said , " Because I have n't met anyone I really like , " and I said , " Come on , Winston , " and he said , " What ? I 'm serious , " and since he sounded like he was I said , " Okay , so what qualities are you looking for in a girlfriend ? " because I was just curious and I wanted to know if he 'd really thought about this and he said , " Well , one thing I know for sure is that she 'll definitely be older , " and I sort of picked my head up and looked down at him and How Stella Got Her Groove Bach 115  | once again he was wearing that I'm-not-kidding-you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be older ? " and he said , " Because girls my age are silly . All they 're looking for is someone who has a nice car and lots of money and is willing to spend it all on them . " " Well , that 's true of a lot of older women , " I said , laughing . " At least in America . But I 'm not one of them . " He laughed too . " In Jamaica money and status are everything . " " How so ? " " Well , where you live and what kind of house you live in is very important . It matters . A great deal . And the women here ? A lot of them do n't work . They stay at home and mind the children and cook . The husbands earn the living . " " Well , I would n't want to be in that position . I can and do pay my own bills , " I said . " I know . You 're different , " he said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was even trying . " So what else ? " " I do n't know . " It felt like he did n't want to talk about it anymore , as if I was doing too much talking , but then he said , " But I hope she 'll be a lot like you . " " Mc ? " " Yes . You . You 're outgoing and I would have to say very brave because you came to Jamaica all alone and you did n't know anyone here . You seem smart and you do n't act as if you 're playing games because you came straight out and told me what you wanted to do and here we are and it 's kind of nice , you know , not to have to play any games . " " What kind of games have you played before ? " " None really , but I 've watched other people . Then again , re arc sonic girls , you know , they pretend to like you but y really do n't . " You ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so . " " You do n't think so ? " " How would I know ? " A fabulous question . " Well . " I sighed , because I 'd never actually told anyone what I thought being in love feels like and it required some thought . " I 'd say it 's when you sort of crave being around a person because he makes you feel extraordinarily good and your adrenaline seems higher and everything moves at a faster rate and you ca n't seem to get enough of that person . " " N000 , I 've never felt like that . " " Have you ever been hurt ? " " My feelings have been hurt . Yes . Sure . " " You have any pets , Winston ? " " What ? " " Pets ? You know . Animals that hang around your house and you give them a name and perhaps feed them in their very own dish . " He laughed . " Yes . I 've got two dogs of no special breed and four lovebirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " Have you ever lost a pet that you loved ? " The expression on his face changed . " Yes . I had a horse for six years and it got some kind of disease and had to be put to sleep . That kind of messed me up . " " You had your own horse ? " " Yeah . My parents own ten of them , but Simeon was mine . " " So you 're a good rider ? " " Used to be . I 'm not as fond of horses as I once was . What about you ? You look like an animal lover . " " Well , n , y son and I have a dog , a cat and some fish . " There was now a sudden silence . " So , " I said .  | " So , " he said . " What are your plans for tomorrow ? " " Parasailing , " I said . He nodded and kissed me again . He could be habitforming , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were n't so damn young . " What about afterwards ? " he asked . " Why ? What are you gettin ' at , darlin ' ? " I said in a southern accent , and he cracked up . " Would you like to have dinner again ? " " What exactly do you mean by dinner ' ? " He looked confused . " I mean we could go into town . Get away from Castle Beach . I 'd like to see you in another setting . Under different circumstances . This place is beginning to feel closed in , no ? " " Yes . But you know what , Winston ? " " What ? " " I think we should do this again . Do n't you ? " " Definitely , " he said with a smirk and then we both burst out laughing as he squeezed me tighter and I pushed my fingers through his hair over and over and over until the back of his head was resting in my palms . " So let 's skip dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . You can be my dinner . " He chuckled . " So does that mean you 'll be my dessert ? " " Absolutely , " I said . " Absolutely . " " All right , " he said and we lay there awhile longer , but because I was a guest at the hotel and if anyone saw him coming out of my room it could ruin his chances of working here , he got up in the middle of the night , put his clothes on and gave me another of those luscious please-don't-go kisses and left quietly . I looked at the cold candles and giggled out loud because I was glad I had n't needed them after all . I then buried my face as deeply as I could in the pillows and sheets  | so I could smell him all over around and through that white cotton until I started feeling all marshmallowy inside and then it hit me that if I was n't mistaken I 'd been turned out by a twenty-one-year-old boy !

He looks better , like he should always get up early and do something . " Hey , good-looking , " he says . " How goes it , Nate ? " " Not as good as you , I can see that . What  --  you been out here running and got your shoes wet ? " " Sort of . " " Having a good time ? " " Oh yes , I 'm having a great time . " " Un-hun , " he says like he 's been a Peeping Tom or something . " You going to Karaoke Night tonight in the piano bar ? " " I 'm not sure . I had n't heard about it . " " It 's always fun . " " But I thought you just got here , Nate . " He chuckles proudly and I ca n't help but watch that fat gut of his writhe . " I told you , this is my eighth time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their first guests after they built this place . I love it here . " " I do too , " I say and begin walking . " Maybe I 'll see you later , " I say . " Well , if you 're going to the beach today , better get out here early . It 's supposed to rain . Maybe even have a little thunderstorm today . " I simply nod even though I 'd love to say : Excuse me , Mr. Weather God , but this is Jamaica . Not America . It is early July . It is summertime here . Not the rainy season . Nate does n't know what the hell he 's talking about . How Stella Got Her Groove flack 117  | After my shower I change and go to the dining room and this place is beginning to feel like home . I see the familiar faces and some new ones as I stand in line to get my Belgian waffle which the young brother who cooks them seems instinctively or predictably to know I want as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of other foods which I totally ignore . I look around for an empty table and do not see Winston anywhere and then I chuckle because I 'm thinking he 's sleeping in because he 's young and still growing . I eat my breakfast alone which is kind of nice and then I gather up my towels and head for the beach . I find my chaise and put my tote with all my junk in it underneath and one of the workers says to me , " When are you gon na snorkel with us , mon ? You look like you love the water every day , come on and snorkel with us today . " " What time ? " " Nine-tirty and one-tirty . " I look at my watch . It 's nine-twenty . " Maybe later , or tomorrow morning . " " I 'll be looking for you , mon . And wear that bathing suit . " He laughs as he drags the boat out into the water .

What wakes me is the volleyball game . It is elevenfifteen . Ben the Canadian sees my head pop up and he yells , " Stella ! Get over here ! We need you ! " " I 'm coining , I 'm coming , " and I get up . I play hard and well . The members of the other team , who were n't here the last time I played , are automatically assuming that because I 'm a woman I 'm going to play like one is supposed to play and I guess a woman is n't supposed to he  | strong or athletically inclined however athletic she may look , so they do not expect me to serve or hit the ball as consistently as I do .

We play until twelve-thirty , at which time I go back into the water , and as I 'm standing there something hits me . I did sleep with a twenty-one-year-old boy last night , did n't I ? And I did immerse myself in him like he was a real man and I have been thinking about him all morning and I did ask him if he would want to do this again tonight , did n't I ? I did . You did , Stella . Yes , you did . What if he wakes up this morning thinking , Oh my God what did I do last night with that old woman ? Why did I say I 'd meet her old ass again tonight ? All I wanted was some pussy and now she 's like wanting to see me again and this is a resort and there is no way for me to hide or get away from her which is why I 'm staying in my room until I know she 's come in from her jog and had her breakfast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or parasailing . That 's what he 's probably thinking , I think as I head toward the dining room . Well , not to worry , Winston . I 'll let you off the hook . It was good and everything but I 'll get by without getting some again . I think . One more time would 've been nice but hey , you 're young and footloose and fancy-free and you do n't need some old broad coming down here on vacation treating you like some gigolo or something , so I can like back off , no problem , mon . I see him sitting at a table , a hundred or so white ceiling fans spinning high above his head , and I notice the mountain of food on his plate and laugh . If this stuff were n't free How Stella Got Her Groove Back 119  | would he be eating so much ? He seems to be looking around the room and when he spots me he smiles and I smile because to be honest I was thinking that if he did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe take my plate outside and let him completely off the hook and then this evening I just would n't show up and since I never told him my last name he would n't have to phone and would n't just show up at my room , at least I do n't think he 'd do something like that , but I wave to him and he motions me to come over so I do . " Hi , Winston , " I say , standing behind a chair . He is looking at me kind of strange , as if something is behind his eyes , some kind of story , but it 's clear that he is trying to figure out how to tell me that even though he had a good time last night he ca n't come tonight , so I 'm like ready for this . " Would you join me for lunch ? " he says . " I 'm really not that hungry , " I say . " Well , would you sit down for a few minutes ? " I hesitate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this shit sitting down , well hey no problem mon , but I do not take my yellow tote with the furry monkey from my shoulder . " Are you all right ? " he asks . He looks worried . " Sure . How about you ? " " I 'm fine , " he says . " Fine . " " Good , " I say and start looking around the dining room . " You look like something 's on your mind , " he says . " And it does n't look good . Did I do something ? " " No , you did n't do anything . " " Were you not so satisfied last night ? " I want to say , Are you crazy ? Satisfied is putting it mildly . I low about ecstatic ? I low about jubilant ? How about calling  | me Ms. Fucking Enchantment ? But instead I say , " Yes , I was thoroughly satisfied last night . What about you , Winston ? " He puts his fork down and looks at me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time with a woman before in my life . " " And what does that mean ? " " It means I had a splendid time with you , Stella . You made me feel something deep and rich inside . Spicy . " He is looking at me from the corners of those black slits he has for eyes and nodding his head up and down as if he is agreeing with himself . All I can think is , Spicy ? I guess I like spicy as long as he does n't mean like jerk chicken spicy . " I 'm glad to hear that , Winston , but ... " " But what ? " " Well , I was thinking . I mean I know we had a good time and everything last night and I know I surely did but it 's daylight now and I just wanted you to know if you have like come to your senses and do n't really want to do this again tonight you can just tell me and it 'll be okay . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to see you again tonight . I could n't wait to see you this morning . Do you know how long I 've been sitting here waiting for you ? " I am like totally fucking touched . This kind of honesty is exactly what a woman wants needs to hear from a man . But why could n't he be at least thirty-five ? Shoot , thirty . I mean really . " Really , Winston ? " " Really . " " Well , can I ask you something ? " " Sure . " " What 's your father like ? " " What do you mean exactly ? " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 121  | " I mean does he look anything like you and is he happy with your mom or what ? " He looks offended and I ca n't believe I even said this .

" " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you to think I 'm like taking this too seriously . " He looks even more offended now . " What do you mean by this ' ? " " You know . " " No , I do n't know . Do you mean the sex or do you mean me ? " I can see that I 'm not saying the right thing and what I am saying is being misconstrued but then again it is n't but all I 'm doing once again in my life is protecting myself from what ? A twenty-one-year-old or my own feelings ? Which one is it , Stella ? " Winston , I 'm sorry . I 'm just a little nervous because I really enjoyed being with you last night . I enjoy being with you period and it 's just that I 'm  --  let 's face it  --  I 'm so much older than you are and I 'm on vacation and you really made me feel totally beautiful and sensuous and like a floating lily pad last night and I could kiss you right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous and can you understand my position ? " He is smiling . " Not to worry , Stella . You should relax and not make everything so hard for yourself . I 'm feeling very good about you and this day ca n't go by fast enough , you know ? " I believe him . " So are you about to go parasailing ? " " Yep . What about you ? Flow are you spending your afternoon ? "  | " Oh . " He sighs . " I 'll probably watch TV all day . " " All day ? " " Yes . I do n't have any special plans , so why not ? " He hunches and then drops his shoulders . If I 'm not mistaken it looks as if he was hoping I 'd join him and he also seems a little disappointed that I 'm going parasailing or that I did n't invite him but if he liked the beach I would love him to come with me but I 'm not about to ask him if what he really wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well be that he does in fact have other plans and he just does n't want to tell me about them so I 'll just go on about my business like I planned . I stand up and readjust my tote on my shoulder . For some reason he suddenly looks lonely sitting there . " So what time is good for you ? " he asks . " I do n't care , " I say . " Stella , I do n't want you to feel obligated . " " Winston , I do n't ... Look , I think we 're both just tripping about this whole thing , and let 's just have some fun , okay ? " He nods in agreement . " Can I tell you something else ? " I say . " Sure , " he says . " Last night I made love to you without forgetting that you were a twenty-one-year-old boy . " " Really , " he says . " Yep . But tonight I 'll make love to you as if you 're a thirty-five-year-old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ignore our age difference and treat you like a real man . " " I was n't aware you thought of me any other way , " he says . I just give him a look . p 123 " Okay , I get it . So what time ? " " You pick the time , " I say . " Now , " he says and starts laughing . " Forget about that silly parasailing . But if you must ... I liked six o'clock yesterday . Would that be all right with you today ? We would have lots of time . " " Six is fine , Winston . But I have a question . " " Shoot . " " What is it you want to do with me that will require lots of time ? " He begins to blush . He is so cute . He is so sweet . God , I could just eat him up right now . I could I could . " You 'll see , " he says . " Let me surprise you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and we give each other these glowing smiles . I walk away headed in the wrong direction and feel as if I 'm on one of those magic carpets and that I 'm like iridescent or something and when I get back out onto the beach I drift down to where the parasailing boats are and I notice that there are thick gray clouds forming in the sky and I hear this rumbling noise above my head and then I feel these little drops of water fall from the sky and I say , " Shit , " and as they begin to gather up momentum I head toward rush back to my room . By the time I fall across the bed to catch my breath it is pouring so hard I can hardly see the ocean at all and I hear this crackling noise and this is really beautiful I think as I open the doors to my balcony and lie across the bed , where I can no longer smell Winston because the maids have changed the linen which kind of pisses me off but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is right here next to me with his arms around me and I can smell him oh yes I can and I inhale him over and over again and it is so peaceful in here and it feels like the kind of afternoon when you turn on the ' I'V and watch On the Waterfront or Casablanca  | or something with Jimmy Cagney or Sidney Poitier in it and you curl up between crisp white sheets and forget the TV is even on and if he were here we could pretend we are in love and that we are made for each other and regardless of what is and what is n't I 'm so glad I came here to this island to vacation and nobody has to know that I am already secretly craving this young man but I can like keep this to myself which is why I close my eyes tighter because I wish he were really here on top of or underneath or beside me but pretending is not quite the same that 's for sure which is why I want the real man not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be fine and we would n't have to worry about anything except how we feel no age no whatevers . I hear a knock on the door . I sit up and I look at my watch and it is three o'clock . It must be the housekeeper but they 've been here already and I am naked for no particular reason and I grab my bathrobe and walk to the door and say , " Who is it ? " and I hear his voice and I sort of fall against the built-in dresser because I can not believe that I have willed him here and when I open the door he is standing there so brown and wet and handsome and those lush green banana plants and fuchsia flowers are framing his tall body and through his T-shirt I can see his skin the curve of those shoulders . The hair on his legs is smooth and slick . His toes glisten inside those blue Birkenstocks and I am like turning into a believer again but all I can think of to say is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry for coming by without phoning but I left my watch here last night and I just realized it and I did n't know your last name because you never told me and Stella , I 've got some bad news . " I do n't like the sound of those last words . " Well , its not really bad had news but I have to leave ( : astir Beach today in an hour 's time . " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 125  | I feel like I am being harpooned or something but I can handle this I knew he was full of doo-doo and I say , " Come on in , Winston . " Coming in the door he ducks and he should n't be what he is who he is whatever he is and I should n't care what he is who he is but I do and I wish I did n't and I wish I could stop this just turn everything to the Off position . He sits down on the edge of the bed and I walk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right next to it . I hand it to him . He is looking at me very strangely . As if he thinks he knows me from somewhere else and he 's trying to place me or something . " Were you napping ? " he asks . " Sort of . " " It 's raining pretty hard , " he says nervously . I change my voice to a no-nonsense let's-cut-to-the-chase tone . " So what 's going on , Winston ? Talk to me . " He is trying to get his watch on and having trouble so I help him and he looks at me and says , " I got hired at Windswept you know the resort right down the road a ways and they want me to start on Monday and I have to go home right away to gather up all my things because I 'll be living there and I 'm going to be assistant to the head chef and it 's only until September but it 's a start and s000 , " he says as his voice drops two octaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really looking forward to our time together tonight but I have to go home . " Fuck you , Winston , I 'm thinking . This is the best one I 've heard yet but I am a grown-up a big girl a woman actually and I did n't come to Negril Jamaica to play any silly childish games with a boy so I say , " No problem , Winston . You do what you have to do . " I le can tell I 'm upset I guess because when he puts his hand on my shoulder I jerk away as if he 's poisonous .  | " I 'm sorry , " he says . " Me too , Winston . Look , " I say and move away from him until the wall prevents me from going any farther . " I hope this is n't a game you 're playing because you 're having second thoughts or you got cold feet about being with me tonight because I told you earlier that I was trying to let you off the hook if you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Stella , I do n't have cold feet and I 'm telling you the truth . Believe me . I 'm probably more disappointed than you are but this position is hard to come by and it is important and I 'm sorry that I have to leave even though I wish I could be in both places at once but my parents have sent a car for me and it 'll be here in less than an hour . Ca n't you understand my dilemma ? " He looks like he 's pleading with me to understand , like he is in fact telling the truth , so I take a deep breath and decide that maybe he is , but still , where does that leave me ? " Good luck in your new job , Winston . It 's been very nice meeting you . And I 'll look you up if I ever come back to Jamaica , " and I head toward the door . He sits there on the edge of the bed for a few more seconds and then stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is feeling like I 'm in the middle of a Saturday matinee movie and my man is about to go off to war and I 'm about ready to say , " Be careful sweetheart , " and " Please come back to me , " and then I 'd like break down which is why I am not enjoying this silly role and I wish I could like turn this channel to like Nick at Nite or something maybe even Annette Funicello when she was a little girl a Mouseketeer on the Mickey Mouse Club or how about Barney whom I have hated from day one but that 's what I could use right now Barney singing I love you You love me We 're a How Stella Gof Her Groove Back 127  | happy famil . . . no , to hell with Barney too , because all of you , you are all into ranting and raving about so much love all the fucking time and it is enough to get on anybody 's nerves when there is no love in your world so just fuck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston ! He is standing in front of me now and he is so lanky and he has that Escape on of course just to bother me and I am not inhaling it right now period and I wish he would like hurry up and leave and stand outside to say whatever it is he has left to say , so I sort of put all my weight on one leg like I 'm about to kick his butt or like I 'm not even worried or concerned about what he has to say if he has anything else to say that is . So I 'm like waiting for him to move . " I want very much to see you before you leave , Stella . " " Oh , really . " " Yes , really . " " And just how are we supposed to do that ? Am I supposed to like run down to Windswept and wait around in the kitchen for you ?

" He 's getting somewhat agitated , I can see that , so I try to clean it up before he has a chance to answer . " I mean look , Winston , you 're just starting the job . How do you know you 'll be able to get away ? " " Because we get two hours of free time each evening . "  | " Wow . Two whole hours . " " It 's all I 'll have , " he says .

" " I will , " he says . " I will . " He bends down and kisses me puts his arms around me and holds me like he loves me or something and I kiss him and squeeze him run my hand up and down the small of his back like I love him or something and then he smiles at me and I see him walk out into the rain and in that split second as he vanishes from my eyesight and I close the door I realize that I am right this very moment already yearning craving longing for him and it also dawns on me that the last time I felt like this I was in love and I wonder could I do I love Winston but I could n't because I do n't really even know him and he is entirely and unquestionably unequivocally irrevocably too young and I am simply on this exotic island and maybe this is an oasis or something or maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already aching at the thought of not seeing him again which is what feels like is going to be the case because I ca n't count how many times I 've wanted something so much and did n't get it and I can easily count how many times I 've loved a man and could n't have him could n't keep him for one reason or another and I ca n't count how many wishes fantasies dreams desires hopes I 've had that have never come true because if I have learned anything in my forty-two years it 's this : whenever things feel too good to be true it 's usually because they are .  | OKAY . SO WHEN IT STOPS RAINING I GET DOLLED up for dinner like I 've been doing and I go to the dining room and fill my plate up with something anything and the Canadians come to my table and Ben says , " Stella , are you going to karaoke tonight ?

For fun , " and I 'm thinking , What the hell , I have no date tonight no plans nothing except this , so I say , " Okay . But what time does it start ? " To my surprise Sasha says , clearly , " Nine o'clock , " and her husband gives her a big squeeze . " She 's getting better every day , " he says , and there she goes again with that plastered smile . After I fill up on whatever it was I ate I head toward the game room and play the slot machines for about twenty minutes and then Norris comes over . " Hi , Stella , " he says . " So I guess you know that Winston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied look . " Yes , I know , " I say . I 've been wondering all along but did n't want to think too much about it but I wonder if Norris is gay because he is almost too sweet for my tastes and now it seems he 's a little too concerned about my interest in Winston . " It 's really great he got the job , do n't you think ? " He looks at me out of the corner of his eye as if he 's hoping to find evidence of disappointment in mine . " Oh yes . I think it 's great . A great opportunity . " " He wo n't be back , " he says . " I know that , Norris . " " You guys were hitting it off there though for a while , hey ? " " He 's a nice kid , " I say . " Yeah , well , anyway you 're coming to the disco after karaoke ? " " I do n't know , Norris . " " Oh come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always fun and Bevon the DJ has already told me he will play Shy Guy ' and Crazy ' by Seal just for you .

I go back to my room and remember I have not talked to my son in quite a few days and that I have also not thought about him all that much if at all until now and as I reach to pick up the phone I realize I can not call him but I decide to leave a message on his dad 's answering machine anyway and all I say is that I am in Jamaica and I am having a wonderful time and I miss you and I hope you will be able to bring some fish home but if not we can always get some from Safeway .

" Girl , what took you so fucking long to call me I 'm like been worried about you and shit thinking maybe your plane crashed or you got kidnapped or something but since you did n't what up ? You having fun got any yet are the men fine or what ? " " Vanessa , stop it . First of all , Negril is gorgeous and I 'm having a great time . I needed this vacation in a major way . Have you been feeding the fish , Dr. Dre and Phoenix ? " " Yes , I 've fed the little critters but Paco 's been doing it too so if they 're like waddling or floating on top of the water all puffed up and shit when you get back do n't blame me . So what 's going on , Sis ? Tell me something good . Tell me something nasty ! " " You ' wo n't even believe it if I tell you . " " What what what ? " " Girl , I slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrollably into the phone . She finally gathers her composure and starts to chuckle , and then I join in , and when we arc finally out of laughter she says , " I ! old up a minute . Now repeat that again . Please . "  | " I said I did it with a twenty-one-year-old , and it was good and he was rather amazing but he got a job and had to leave and I kind of liked him , Vanessa . " " You ca n't even be serious ? Wait a minute . No . I like the part about fucking him . Let 's go there . What was it like , tell me all the details , but what do you mean you kind of liked him ' ? " " Well , I did n't like just fuck him . " " Oh , do n't tell me you guys like made love and shit . " " We did . That 's exactly what we did . " " You fucked him , Stella . Get real . Is he Jamaican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you mean you do n't know ? You did n't see it ? Well , you had to feel it . " " No I did n't see it and yes I felt it and all I can say is that it felt  --  what difference does it make what size it is ? That is not the point I 'm trying to make here . " " Yeah , well , just what point might that be ? " " The point is that he is very nice and manly in more ways than in bed . " " Are you gon na get some more or not because Lord knows your dead ass could use as much as you can get . So are you like turnt out , girl ? Did you have to go all the way to Jamaica to get your groove back on by a . . . how old is he again ? Did you really say twenty-one ? " " Well , actually he wo n't be twenty-one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a big fucking difference , huh ! Anyway all I can say is You go , girl ! ! ! " " Vanessa ? " " What ? " p 133 " Do n't tell Angela . She wo n't get it . " " Get what ? " " She 's so ... you know . " " Say no more . I know how to keep my mouth shut but you know she 's worried as all hell about you , so you should call her for a hot minute . " " I will after I finish talking to you . " " I need to ask you a big favor , Sis . " " What now , Vanessa ? " " Do n't say it like that , damn . You have the right to say no . " First tell me what it is . You 're already driving my car . " " Can I borrow a thousand to fifteen hundred until I get my income tax refund ? " " Would it be an invasion of privacy if I asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few bills . " " What else is new , Vanessa ? " " My car insurance is about to lapse . " " So I should n't even ask why you 're behind , should I ? " " Same old same old . Checks do n't stretch but so far . " " You said when you get your income tax refund . Now tell me something . Is it July ? " " I filed late . I 'm good for it , Stella . Just let me know if you 'll do it so I can write this check . " " Wait till I get back . But you know you still owe me close to six hundred from Christmas , or did we forget ? " " We have n't forgotten . " " Do n't , Vanessa . I am not a bank . Got it ? " " Got it . Now , " she says , sounding relieved , " are you like blacker or what ? " " About four shades . You could say I 'm bronzed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's fine . "  | " And work ? " " Motherfuckers still dying left and right . I 'm about tired of working in ER really . All these gangbangers killing each other and shit is getting old . I ca n't take too much more of it . I 'm serious . " " Well , lots of their stupid-ass parents are baby boomers like the majority of adult Americans which means they should 've been hip to Malcolm and Martin and they should 've had sense enough to teach their kids  --  especially their sons  --  what 's up and if they had 've these kids probably would n't be out there blowing each other 's brains out stabbing each other like death is a joke like they 're going to get a chance to do this again and if they like made an audiotape of The Autobiography of Malcolm X required listening ? since they wo n't read anything  --  in say third grade maybe these kids would know that the war is outside not inside , do n't you think ? " " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a church for the fucking profane . But anyway , Sis , I 've got ta go . Got ta clock in . Send me a postcard and enjoy that young man ! " " I will , " I say but just as I 'm about to hang up I hear her yell out : " Take one little vacation and in a matter of days you turn into Sally the Slut ! " " You go straight to hell , Vanessa . " I try to wipe the smirk off my face . " And I love you too . " I stare at the phone because I am not in the mood for talking to Miss Tiddledywinks but she might be on the verge of a nervous breakdown or probably just itching to call 911 in Jamaica so I dial her number praying she 's at like Target or Strouds or the Price Club picking out new eyelet comforters or something but when she answers I change my tone . " Angela ? " " It 's about time you called . Why did n't you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you arrived safely ? Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine . Damn . If you did n't get any telegrams , that should 've told you I arrived safely . " " Forget it , Stella . It 's simply called consideration . That 's all . Are you having any fun or what ? " " I 'm having a ball . " " Have you met any interesting people ? " " Yes . " " With or without clothes ? " " Well , both . Sort of . " " You did n't , Stella . " " Yes I did , Angela . " " What is with this Jamaican business that makes undressing so compulsory ? " " Do n't let it worry you , Angela . I just wanted to call to say hello and let you know that I 'm having a ball . " " Well , have you done anything in the water yet ? " I wanted to say , If I get lucky again , but instead said , " I 've been parasailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn . And it 's only Saturday . All this in three days ? " " When it 's already paid for , you do as much of it as you can . " So how are the men ? " " What men ? " " The Jamaican men . " " They 're mostly American and they 're all in the NBA or NFL and they 're all with their wives or girlfriends . " " So that means you have n't met a soul who 's available ? " ' ohc . " I told you you should n't have gone by yourself , did n't I ? " But I 'm still having a great time , Angela . "  | " Yeah , right . The signal you 're probably sending out is : Hey , I 'm alone and I like it this way . I 'm off limits , out of bounds , and I do n't need a man . I 'm just fine by myself thank you very much . " " That is ridiculous . I do not emit any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body language , Stella . You can be hard , you know . Well , maybe hard is too harsh a word . But you can be very businesslike , downright cold . No eye contact whatsoever and I 've seen you carry yourself in such a way that no man would even dream of approaching you . To be honest , I 'm beginning to wonder if you do n't prefer being single . " " Sure , I want to spend the rest of my life alone . " " Whatever you do , just please do not come home telling us about some tropical fling you 've had with some Jamaican guy and you 're in love and what have you . Those island romances do n't count because they 're not real . Those guys all want to become citizens , so they 'll sweet-talk you if they think it 'll get them to the States . Just keep this in mind if you even come close to warming up to somebody . " Skip the subject , Stella . " Is Evan coming home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sports recruiting company . He 'll be home for a week before school starts , sometime in mid-August . Why ? " " Just curious . Be nice to see him . " " You just saw him at Easter . " " I know . Does he still have that same girlfriend ? " " Do n't ask me about her , okay ? " " I just did . " " She 's pregnant . " " Again ? " " Yes . But this time she 's keeping it . " p 137 " No ! " " I 'm three minutes from flying there and snatching it out of her . This was all planned . And Evan is too stupid to realize that he 's been set up . " " How many months is she ? " " Would you believe four ? " " Whoa . She 's on a serious mission , huh ? " " Evan wants her to move on campus with him and get married . " " Can we switch to another topic ? I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't even want to believe that the words you just uttered about my one and only favorite nephew are even close to being true . " I can tell Angela is crying . I 'm wondering if it 's due mostly to those pregnancy hormones kicking in . " Angela , are you all right ? " " Yeah . I 'm just so fucking angry at Evan for being such an idiot . I do n't understand how he could fall for the okeydoke like this . Jennifer is such a manipulator and . . . oh forget it . This will be handled , and I 'm sorry for ruining your mood . " " It 's okay . But look , Angela , tonight 's karaoke and it 's starting in a few minutes . " " Oh , wow , now that sounds like fun . But before you hang up I want to tell you that the babies moved . " " No shit ! " " No shit . It 's so weird feeling two of them . " " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . " You 're the one who should be having a baby , Stella . It would be good for Quincy to have a little brother or sister . " Oh please , not this baby business again . Especially under the circumstances and all . I am really getting tired of listening to these unsolicited opinions and I 'm especially sick of  | watching these over-forty women having their first child and acting as if the world is like supposed to stop . I do not would not dream of could not even fathom changing another pissy poopy Pamper or getting up in the middle of the night to a screaming I-need-a-bottle baby . No thank you . Angela wants to repeat herself and she 'll remember soon enough how hard it is , especially when she watches her husband curl up into an even tighter knot each time she jumps out of that bed to go bond with the little crumb snatchers . I did my baby number . I love my son . But you could n't pay me enough money to get pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was born I 'd probably already be its grandmother . " As soon as I get home and find a brand-new husband we 're going to get right on top of things so to speak and start working on adding to our family at our earliest convenience . How 's that suit you , Angela ? " " You go to hell , Stella . But seriously . Have a great time and try to stay out of trouble . " " Not to worry , " I say . " What did you say ? " " Nothing , " I say . " Bye , Angela . And I love you too . " Boy , and I thought my life was sad . It is time for karaoke and I drag myself down the pathway and say hello to the night workers and go upstairs to the piano bar and sure enough it is filled to the brim with people mostly white people and they are singing up a storm and the words are on the white wall and they hand me a book and say pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I go downstairs and find myself walking into the empty disco where Devon the I ) J is testing out his selections for tonight and I ask him if he 'll play Diana King 's " Shy Guy " and he says sure and he p 139 does and I stand on the dance floor by myself and dance and then he plays one of my absolute favorites by Seal , " Dreaming in Metaphors , " and then " Groovin in the Midnight " by Maxi Priest , " Open Your Heart " by M People , and after " I 'm Ready " by Tevin Campbell I have swerved swayed and swiveled until this sadness this hollow feeling overwhelms me and I say thank you and get out of there until I find myself taking a shower and putting on my cotton pajamas and sliding under the covers which do not smell like anything at all and I spend hours trying to shut down my brain and heart to rid them of him his image his scent those fucking kisses until I guess I finally fall asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet feel like lead and why is it that this beach seems longer and it 's already hot too damn hot and why does it have to be so hot so early in the morning ? Huh ? I pass quite a few people on the beach , two of whom to my surprise are black women . They say hello and give me the thumbs-up and I think it is nice to see yourself outside yourself sometimes and it is also a nice feeling when black people acknowledge each other . I continue with my normal routine after I run . I do the breakfast thing but Winston does not appear and I pretend that I 'm not thinking about him but I have to make myself blink sometimes because it seems as if I see his translucent form walking right through these tables and heading in my direction . The two women I saw on the beach stop at my table with their trays . " Mind if we join you ? " the taller one asks . " Not at all , " I say . We introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I guessed that she 's a model it turns out she 's  | surgery resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Cambridge . She barely looks old enough to be a candy striper . Patrice is an anesthesiologist at St. Luke 's in Manhattan and she looks Puerto Rican or like she 's mixed with something ; her skin is flawless , a smooth creamy shade of brown , and her hair is long and thin , bone straight and black , and as soon as they start talking I 'm sure they 're both from the South somewhere but it turns out to be Chicago and they 've been friends since elementary school . I tell them I 'm from Chicago too but I grew up in the burbs and so did they and we like bond immediately because of the strong geographical factor . I tell them what I do for a living and once we get all this over with we sort of feel like , well , like three girls on vacation . " What made you guys come to Negril ? " I ask . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tonya says and they laugh . Tonya is pulling her hair back into a ponytail . They are in great shape : Patrice has one of those Shape magazine bodies and Tonya looks like a few more crunches a day and she 'd be a runner-up for the cover . Neither of them has any children and they 're both thirty-one years old . " You guys did n't come down here to get in trouble or anything , did you ? " Patrice blushes and says , " Not really . We love our husbands even though they get on our nerves sometimes , but we 've both been working so hard these last eight or nine months and we hardly ever get to see each other anymore so we decided to take a girls ' vacation and leave their butts at home . That 's all . " " That sounds healthy , " I say . " Did I mention that I 'm two months pregnant ? " Tonya says . " No , " I say . " Congratulations . " p 141 Tonya says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your man ? " I feel kind of flushed . " Well , I came alone . " " You go , girl , " she says , and they give each other a high five . " So . Have you gotten in any trouble ? " Patrice asks and they both lean forward so all four of their combined breasts rest on the table . I am blushing harder . " Tell us , girl , tell us ! Curious minds wan na know ! " I lean forward and now there are six breasts sitting on the table . " Well , since I do n't know you sisters I guess it 's safe to tell you but I should be ashamed of myself even though I 'm not but I slept with a twenty-one-year-old Jamaican guy . " " No you did n't ! " Patrice says . " Yes I did , " I say . " So what was it like doing it with a kid ? " Tonya asks . I do n't like the sound of that . " He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What was it like ? " " Yeah , tell us . How was it , girl ? " Patrice asks , bending even closer . " Well , he moved like butter for one thing and I 'm here to testify that I have never been kissed so good in my entire life . " " Get outta here , " Patrice says , looking envious . " A kiss can do it to you sometimes , " Tonya says . " Tell me about it . I was like totally shocked . I mean here I am thinking I 'm gon na teach him a few things , turn this young boy out and blow his mind and hopefully make him think he 's on fire and , well , do you see flames coming out of these braids or what ? " " It was that good , huh ? " Patrice groans . " I 'm not even talking about the sex , you guys . It was  | some other stuff going on that I ca n't put my finger on . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up really . Because he 's gone . " " Damn , " Patrice says and takes a sip of her lemonade . " Where 'd he go ? " Tonya asks . " Well , he got a new job working down the road at Windswept so he had to go home and get his stuff which is like a four-hour drive from here because when he comes back he 'll be like living there and everything . " " So go visit him , " Patrice says . " My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon . It 's a beautiful resort , for couples only . Girl , go on down there and get your man , " and the three of us start laughing . I shake my head back and forth . " Ca n't do that . Do n't know him well enough and I could scare the daylights out of him . Nope . I just wish I could stop thinking about him . " " This is too deep for me , " Tonya says . " Girl , forget about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-nighter . You 're on vacation . On a tropical island . It 's called a fling . Not to be confused with the beginning or blossoming of a new relationship . The guy is exotic and goes with the island . It 's not like something like this could lead to marriage ! Find yourself a new victim tonight , girl , and you 'll get over this little infatuation before you even blink . " " Would you shut your mouth , Tonya , " Patrice moans and now all of us sit up and I feel like I 've just reenacted the last episode of I 'll Fly Away or something and we are all gathering our composure and trying to step out of that zone . Patrice seems to be totally identifying as if she 's been here done that she can relate , girl , when Holly , this sexy tall lithe young social director with short curly hair whose breasts are so voluptuous they make all three sets of ours look weak and who has apparently been ill for the last two days flops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our table and announces herself by saying " Hello " loudly in a British accent . We each say hello back to her , and she . sings , " Do n't let me interrupt you . Carry on , " and she taps the tabletop with her palm . And so I do . " Anyway I miss my new boyfriend . " And Holly says , " Boyfriend ? What 's his name there ? " And I say , " Win-ston , " in a Jamaican accent . And she says , " You 've got to be kidding . Not tall skinny homely Winston with the big lips ? " Patrice and Tonya are doing that tennis-watching thing with their heads and I say , " Yes , he 's my friend . Why , what 's wrong with Winston ? " Holly makes a yucky face and then pushes the air with her hands and says , " He 's been after me for so long now he 's getting on my nerves . " All of our eyebrows go up , but looking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly eyelashes long shapely legs that tiny waist those curvy hips  --  she could easily be a high-paid runway model  --  I totally understand why Winston would be persistent in calling her . The fact that she does not take my " my boyfriend " at all seriously even though I was trying for facetiousness ( although deep down inside I liked the sound of it after I said it ) is kind of like a reality check and is somewhat heartbreaking for me at this moment in time and space . " You mean you do n't find Winston attractive ? " I ask , trying not to sound defensive . " He 's kind of cute but far too skinny . He really needs to gain some weight and he has no money and he 's far too passive . " " Passive ? " I say . I want to say , I beg to differ with you , sweetheart , but I do n't , and as I 'm thinking this Patrice and  | Tonya both give me the eye but Holly keeps right on talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually and besides I 'm sick of Jamaican men . They have no money , hardly any class at all , they ca n't dress , and I 'm hoping to meet an American man one of these days . " " Is that why you have this job ? " Patrice asks . " No . It 's just a job , " she says , looking around the dining room , perhaps for a prospect . I 'd really have liked to tell her that young men rarely go on vacation alone because they do n't know how to entertain themselves and basically because they 're , well , stupid and they do n't want to bet on getting lucky when they can just pay up front and bring all the luck they need with them . So the chances of her actually meeting somebody who would forget about the Miss America runner-up he brought with him and go off in her direction would be slim indeed and she should save up her money and just like get on a plane and fly to the U.S.A. , though her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't dare say this to her ) be even slimmer because there are millions of pretty women in the United States hoping and praying they get lucky too . Holly taps the table again with her palm and jumps up . " Well , got ta go . Enjoy your breakfast . Are any of you ladies interested in a game of volleyball today ? " We look at each other . I say , " Maybe , " and Patrice says , " Maybe , " and Tonya says , " Maybe , " and then we all laugh . " She was cute , " Tonya says . " She was phony and knows exactly how cute she is , but forget about her , we want to hear more about Winston , " Patrice says . So I go hack to day one and tell them everything and by the time I finish we are lying out on the beach on our respec- p 145 Live chaise longues and Norris comes over and says , " Ladies , are you going to play volleyball today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly looking at me and he says , " Did you know Winston stopped by this morning to drop off my key ? You do know he was sharing my room ? " And I say , " No , " and he smiles like the bitch he is and says , " Yep , " and turns around and struts away like Naomi and Cindy do on those runways . I hate him . " Who 's Miss Thang ? " Patrice asks over her sunglasses . " I think he has a crush on Winston , " I say . " That 's pretty obvious , " Tonya says and rolls over . " I do n't want to play volleyball , " I say . " Me neither . We just got here last night and we 're tired , " Tonya says . " Yeah , " says Patrice . " I 'm volleying right here . " We basically ignore Holly and Norris and when we hear the sound of drums and cymbals and " The Star-Spangled Banner " we each pull our sunglasses away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming from . We simply do not can not believe what we see coming in our direction : a parade of red white and blue painted people . And there are about fifty or sixty of them ! " They must think today is the Fourth of July ! " I yell . " You ai n't never lied , " Tonya says . And we sit there until these naked patriots march right by us , their bodies painted interpretations of the American flag . Lips are red . Hair is blue . Black bodies are rendered iridescent white . Stars are painted across bellies and behinds and . in old man 's penis is red white and blue while a woman who has not had the liposuction she needs has miniature flags covering her private area and glued to each of her huge breasts . They are blowing trumpets singing up a storm and waving as they walk past us . We watch the heat from the sun  | melt the blue red and white but we are too stunned to comment and we just stare until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sort of lie there and it is obvious that we are all thinking the same thing : did we just see a parade of painted naked people marching along the beach ? We think we did we think we did we think we did . To our complete astonishment , the volleyball game has continued uninterrupted . We shake our heads back and forth and drop them against our towels , which are rolled to form pillows , until we get so hot we run out into the water and swim for a while and then I guess we eat lunch and then I take my afternoon nap and then I eat dinner again and walk into the empty disco and it is boring and I go to my room and wonder what Winston is doing if he is thinking about me at all and I am thinking it is only Sunday and I still have all of Monday Tuesday and Wednesday left to go and why on earth did I have to stay so many days what am I going to do here on this stupid island without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not quite as stimulating company as Winston is and as I look out at those massive waves crashing against the big rocks again and I press Seal On again and I stand out on that balcony and breathe in the ocean air again and look out as far as I can but do n't see anything at all except the world looking as if it ends somewhere out there and I step back inside and close the French doors because I 'm tired of all this beauty all this water all this whatever , because it feels like this tropical fever has broken and now I just want to go home .  | " I 'M REALLY BEGINNING TO WONDER IF MAYBE I 'M under some kind of spell or something , " I say to Tonya and Patrice . We are lying on our stomachs oiled down and glowing on our chaise longues on the beach and of course I am drinking my third virgin pina colada of the afternoon and they 're on their fourth real pina coladas . " Girl , you sound like you 're lovesick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . " Why is it impossible ? " she asks . " Because he 's a child , " I hear myself say . Stella , come off it , girl , you know deep down inside you are totally smitten  | with this young man and you are the one who keeps tripping on his age when in fact is it really just his age that 's causing you so much discomfort or are you uncomfortable because of your discomfort , which is basically a reaction to the high-yield comfort level he generated inside you , and because he happens to be young you have made that a negative and as usual chosen the negative as your focal point instead of the good stuff ? I mean is n't it a much cooler cop-out to trip on the fact that he is young and therefore somehow unacceptable , but what if he were like white or Jewish or Asian or even a woman  --  I mean if you keep saying too young you can like use this defense for the benefit of who , Stella ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be then ? " Winston does n't sound like any child I 've ever met , " Patrice says . " He 's six foot four , living on his own , working full time , and he certainly approached you like a grown-up and he sounds very much like a man to my mind . " " Seriously , " I say , " they do do that kind of stuff down here , do n't they ? Do n't they have like conjure women who work their mojos on you for a nominal fee ? " " I 've heard of them , " Patrice says , nodding . " He probably had this all planned from the beginning . He chose me . Or she probably chose me for him and he just went along for the ride . Maybe he 's under the spell too . " " Girl , you 're tripping too hard . " Patrice rolls over on her side . I sit up and look down at my thighs and legs and realize I am now totally bronzed and boy I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk into the water , when running down the beach heading straight toward us looking like one of those men in a Calvin Klein ad is a very real bronzed statue and it is moving faster and as he gets closer I/we sec that he is absolutely gorgeous ! I look over at Patrice and ' lnya and they both pull their p 149 sunglasses down over their noses and we simply watch him as he approaches us and he is not wearing any shoes or shirt just dark nylon running shorts and he looks like a wide receiver because he is tall and muscular but his neck is not enormous his body is not puffed up and bulky like most football players ' but his thighs legs shoulders triceps biceps are perfectly formed and now that I can see him closer he is the color of espresso and his mustache is thick and flourishing and his hair is cut close and look at those cheekbones and the hair on that chest and those pectorals pushing out from under it and when he looks directly into my face and smiles showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hello , " and then he turns to Patrice and Tonya and says , " Hello , " and we are totally awestruck , can just barely manage a weak " Hi " but the three of us say it pretty much in unison . He runs over to the outside shower which is close to the grassy area and I do n't realize it but I 'm like staring at him as he pulls that silver chain down and the water forms a silver waterfall over his body and the now-chocolate water bounces off his shoulder blades in little droplets that splash against the concrete and he turns his face up to the spray and I 'm thinking as I notice that his waistline is probably smaller than mine that he should do some ads for Calvin ( I might call Calvin when I get home to tell him that I 've found his man for real ) and then I hear Patrice say , " Go on over there and get him , girl . " Then Tonya sits up and says , " Something that looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he come from ? " " I do n't know but God must 've sent him here for a rea-son , " I say and finally I push my feet into the white sand and then into the water . I walk out until I 'm up to my shoulders and when I turn around I am positive that that man is looking at me and if he 's not he is looking in my direction  | and then when he waves and smiles I dunk my head under the water . This is unreal . I mean damn , here I am suffering from an enormous all-encompassing sense of heartache and now this black knight comes out of nowhere and where is his horse is what I 'm thinking as I try to focus my eyes to adjust to the thick wetness to see if I can spot any fish families but I ca n't seem to see clearly today and when I come up for air he is gone . I walk run through the water back to the shore where Tonya is now reading some medical journal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper but when they see me they drop their respective books in their laps and this time they take their sunglasses off . " Girl , did you get a good look at him ? " Patrice asks . " I did , " I say . " But where 'd he go ? " " Up there , " Tonya says , pointing to the second floor of the beachfront rooms that 're right behind the volleyball area . I pick up my towel and dry off . " If I knew it was gon na be raining men I 'd 've come down here a long time ago , " I say . " Well , it must just be in the stars for you , girlfriend , because we 've been here two days now and the most play we 've gotten is from little short guys or really old guys and all they say is , Hey , mon . ' These wedding rings scare folks off , which is just fine with us . I love my husband , " Tonya says . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Patrice says . " But you , girlfriend , you ought to have as much fun as you can while you 're here . You are single . And Winston is gone . " Byeee , Winston . " ' I'onya sighs , waving to the air . " When you snooze you lose , baby . "  | " How many days do you have left ? " Patrice asks . " Three , " I say . " We leave in two . But three days is plenty of time to do some damage , " Tonya says . Later , Tonya asks me , " What are you doing for dinner tonight ? " " Eating , " I say . " Funny . You want to go to Rick 's Cafe with us ? " " I 've heard of that  --  it 's in one of my brochures or something . " " It 's fabulous . It 's about fifteen minutes from here near the tip of the island and some white guy named Rick owns it and it 's outside and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat lobster and watch these fools dive off . " " You 're kidding , " I say . " I kid you not , but it 's also known for the best sunsets you 'll ever see anywhere , so you wan na come with us ? " " Sure , why not , " I say . When our taxi driver picks us up , he looks like he has just been told a good joke . I sit in the front seat because there is no room in the back after Tonya and Patrice get in his little Subaru . We pay him forty American dollars and he will wait for us outside Rick 's Cafe until we are ready to leave . He is blasting this reggae station so loud that the bass actually hurts our ears . " Can you give us a break on the bass , brother ? " Tonya asks . No problem , mon , " he says , still grinning his ass off . " So  | are you married ? " he asks me and puts his left arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the steering wheel , which is also on the right . " No , " I say . " No ? What a pity . " " Are you ? " I ask . " Yes , but you are no less beautiful because of it . " " You better keep your eye on the road . " I can hear Patrice and Tonya cracking up in the back . " I 'm keeping my eye on you , " he says . " Do you have children ? " " Yes , two . " Without thinking I take my hand and whop him upside the head . " Then think about them and stop flirting with strange women or I 'll get your name and number and call your wife ! " He immediately puts both hands on that steering wheel and begins to laugh and we all laugh as the car continues rocking because this narrow road is bumpy as hell and it seems as if everything and everybody are out this evening . Lining the road are hundreds of what look like workers leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large groups and all are dressed in the same brown purple or green uniforms and many of their arms are outstretched hoping to catch a ride and our driver is honking and waving at lots of them although he does n't stop because he has a fare . Then there are these anorexic-looking dogs and the spookiest-looking cats I 've ever seen , standing in the middle of the road as if they 're waiting for us to go around them which the driver does and then there are goats and cows tied to trees with rope that does n't look strong enough and they walk right to the edge of the road and simply stop . I can tell we are going uphill but I do n't know how high we are until we get out and walk out onto the patio of ' Rick 's p 153 and we are up high all right . There are two or three hundred people here already but we are able to get a table and when I glance over at the rocky cliffs it kind of looks like a small section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've seen enough pictures to know what a small section of Rome looks like and this could be a small section of Rome . This is really an inlet , a cove with jagged rocks leading to the top , where there is a herd of trees just standing there and a sign that says big and bold : " Beware of the Dog . " These young Jamaican boys whose little chests almost look caved in jump like a hundred feet into the air like seagulls with their arms spread out and they really look like they 're soaring as they cut through the dark turquoise water with hardly a splash . I am like totally amazed as we sit there and watch the sun beginning to set and at first it is as yellow as a yolk and then it turns tangerine and then burnt orange and then ruby red and then a deep purple and at least five hundred tourists have their cameras and camcorders out and I 'm wondering how do you videotape a sunset ? These are the type of home videos people show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatives want to go outside to smoke a cigarette or a joint . These kind of people stand there and reload the VCR and pretty much forget your ass is even there because they are like reliving that moment remembering exactly what they were eating , like I am about to do with this lobster right now because my mouth is watering and it is so beautiful here and I am glad I 'm not thinking about Winston and yet I 'm curious I wonder if he 's ever been here and jumped off this cliff he had to because he said he was on the swim team but when I look back out to the highest edge I see a grown man jump off backwards and do a double flip and my heart almost flies out of my chest and hundreds of people are applauding and yet what he wants are American  | dollars and preferably not ones from what I gather and then I notice that right down below us is a crowded lower platform from which tourists with common sense are jumping off and this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . Next time . I wear my peach jogging shorts and matching sports bra with matching socks and I 'm beginning to think I look too much like those girls on those exercise videos and I vow to mix and match tomorrow . It is only seven o'clock and the beach is mine again until after I finish my run . I am doing my stretches against one of the sailboats when I hear , " Hello again , " in the sexiest voice I have heard in ages with the exception of James Earl Jones and Wesley Snipes and when I turn around it is Mr. Espresso himself in those short shorts again but now he is wearing one of those muscle shirts with a trillion little holes in it and I realize how rare it is that I hear a black man speak with a British accent . " Good morning , " I say and am glad that I wore this little Jane Fonda outfit after all . I do however wish that my legs were not so thin and short and that God could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs could be firmer since I 've been doing that inner-thigh exercise now for about a year and maybe I should 've gone ahead and got those silicone implants before they took the shits off the market because then all I 'd need to complete this look is a peach sweatband to go around my forehead . Even though I do n't want to lift my other leg and rock forward I feel like I have to in order to not feel imposed upon by his presence so I lean over which is supposed to stretch out my quads and I can feel my glutes pulling which is apparently what he is looking at because I bust him when I turn and say , " Are you about to go on your run ? "  | He smiles at me like he is already imagining making love to me and for some reason I can picture myself doing it with him and I sort of have to shake this image off by pushing back on my hamstrings because I am worried that maybe I am turning into a real slut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just came back , I see . " " Yes . " " We should run together , " he says . " That sounds good . " " Could you run again now ? " " No way , " I say . " I wish I could , but I 'm not in that great shape . " " You look like you 're in pretty good shape , " he says , giving my body a once-over . Now if I was at home in America I might be tempted to cuss his ass out for looking at me this way but why I am flattered and not offended one iota is escaping me and I decide not to question it any further so I simply say , " Thank you . " He holds out his arm to shake my hand and says , " I 'm Judas Germaine Rozelle , " and all I 'm thinking is who ? but I extend my hand and say , " I 'm Stella . " " Stella what ? " I can not fucking remember my last name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but I decide I do n't know this man and I did n't tell Winston my last name and this guy 's like a complete stranger and he might not even be a registered guest at this hotel and he could like actually be a rapist or a serial killer who jogs and also happens to be fine as hell .01 just say , " Stella 'll have to do for now . " You are a slut , I think , because I say it like I 'm flirting with him which I guess I kind of am . " So , " he says with a smiling sigh , " what brings you to Jamaica ? " " The sun the beach the island air , " I say .  | He 's nodding in agreement . " And you are from . . . ? " I want to say guess , but I do n't feel like playing games and besides I have to go to the bathroom really bad . " California . " " I see , " he says . " Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Northern . The Bay Area . Forty minutes outside of San Francisco . " " It 's very nice there , " he says . Now I 'm nodding like a total idiot . " And you 're from ... ? " " Born in Senegal , grew up in London , but live in Atlanta . " " Atlanta ? " " Yes , " he says and God certainly knew what He was doing when He was passing out sexy smiles . Judas must 've been second in line , right after Winston , but of course it had to be by quite a few years . . . . But stop it , Stella . This man certainly looks like he 's of legal age although I ca n't tell really how old he is but at least I know he can buy liquor . " I 've been in America since I was twenty-two . " My eyebrows go up . " And you 're how old now ? " I ask and then realize it is a totally stupid and inappropriate question but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four . Why do you ask ? " " I do n't know , really , I did n't even mean to ask . What brought you to America ? " " Well , years ago I played rugby while at Oxford and then I came to America to finish my studies in civil and structural engineering at Emory University , which is in Atlanta , of course , and I basically never left . " " Why Atlanta ? " " Why not ? I love Atlanta . There are so many black people there and it is a great place from which to operate . " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 157  | " What do you mean by operate ? " " Well , I 'm a developer and I plan and design business parks  --  you know those kinds of complexes : office buildings , shopping centers and others  --  both in America and abroad . " ? Really ? " I say . " Yes , really . And you ? What do you do for a living and before you even answer I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't . I 'm a securities analyst , " I say and leave it at that . He should know what it means . ? Fascinating , " he says and seems to mean it . " So are you here with someone ? " He is stroking his chin and smiling at me and appears to be looking right through this jogging outfit like he can picture what I look like without it and if it were n't obvious and if he were n't so good at it and if I were like at home or say in Oakland I 'd probably ask him what the fuck he is staring at . " Well , actually I came alone . " " I love it , " he says , gleaming . " You are my kind of lady . All the way from America without a companion , hey ? " yep. ? " Marvelous . You are very independent and high-spirited . I can tell . " " How can you tell all this ? " " A man knows . I knew it when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me playing volleyball ? " " Indeed I did . You could n't see me because I did n't want you to see me staring , but you are very athletic and you gave those guys a run for the money . " " I played volleyball all through high school . " " Well , a lot of people did but they are not necessarily  | good at it and you are so strong , I love it , " he says and actually giggles . At home this kind of talk would almost certainly be on the verge of getting on my nerves and I ca n't understand why it 's not now . " What about you , Judas ? Are you here with your wife ? " " Me ? N000 , I have no wife . I brought a dear friend and she is only a friend , " he says significantly . " She has recently been in a bad automobile accident and had to have her left arm amputated and she has been very depressed about that , so I brought her here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there she is , " and he points to this huge woman in a muumuu whom I had to look at twice because from here she looked like she could be his mother , but I should talk ! Instead I just say , " That 's very nice . " I have long since finished my stretches and ca n't even fake another one and I am about to cross my legs , so I say , " Look , Judas , it was very nice meeting you and maybe I 'll see you later but I have to go to the bathroom something terrible , " and he laughs and says , " Go go go , but what time do you anticipate having lunch ? " and I say , " About one o'clock , " and he says , " I 'll see you then , " and I say , " Okay , " and run toward the hotel . I go into the ladies ' room which smells like raspberry Bubblicious bubble gum for which I am totally grateful and after I am relieved I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in the mirror and all I 'm thinking is : What in the world are you doing down here in Jamaica , girl , except getting yourself in nothing but trouble ? I see Judas at lunch with that woman and when he comes over to me she does n't look happy about it . " She 's not feelHow Stella Got Her Groove Back 159  | ing very well . I 'm going to take her to her room so she can rest and I 'll be right back , " he says . I say something like okay but I am not . about to sit here and wait for this African hunk . I mean African men scare me because I 've heard how like if you kiss them once and do the nasty besides they want to marry you and then expect you to stay in the kitchen and cook and clean and to be a passive obedient child like all those Japanese and Chinese and Muslim women and they want you to have baby after baby ( except for in China of course ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a clitoris thanks to the men who are the ones who get to enjoy sex with as many women as they can squeeze in and I 'll be glad when these women get hip and just say no you are not cutting off my daughter 's clitoris and if you touch her I 'll cut your penis off how about that for a change of pace or they should go get their bachelor 's and master 's and get a job  --  no , a career  --  and have a nanny and a housekeeper to clean the house and then they should rip off all those garments and those hot-ass veils and just let their hair down because what does all this really have to do with religion when you think about it ? How do the clothes you wear limit or prohibit your ability to express your spirituality , your beliefs and love for a Higher Power anyway end hey , who was it that decided that women should hide their bodies their faces their hair ? Shall we take a wild guess ? Let 's try men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear wigs and veils ? And when I think about it why is n't the mother of Jesus ever really mentioned all that much except for at Christmas ? I mean why does n't Mary get more play , because Jesus is always simply referred to as like the son of Cod , well , what about Mom and I mean let 's get real even though I have heard recently how they are rewriting the able again to make it politically correct which is a crying  | shame when I think about it but these women should get a room of their own a life of their own like Virginia Woolf did because times have like totally changed and it is like the fucking nineties all over the world . Then again I think that African men only try to capture and lure you into matrimony when they want to become American citizens . Well , do n't they all ? But this Judas here already told me that he is an American and proud of it but it does n't matter right now because I 've had it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only gotten my groove back but also gotten my nerve up I decide that today is the day I will finally go parasailing for real which is exactly what I do . I see Judas with his friend again at dinner time and he comes over to me and says , " You disappeared this afternoon , but why ? " " I was n't feeling so good , " I say . " Are you feeling better now ? " " Yes . Much . " " Good , " he says . " Are you running in the morning ? " " Yes . " " Would you like to run with me ? " Would I ? I think . " What time ? " " Whatever is convenient for you , " he says . " Wo n't your friend be upset ? " I ask . He turns to look at her and then back at me . " No . She 's fine . Do n't worry . " " How about seven ? " " Seven is fine , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now it is Tuesday evening and even though the hotel is quieter than it 's been since I 've gotten here , Tanya , Patrice and I cat at the fancy-smancy French restaurant here on the premises and it was well worth the wait and then we p 161 dance by ourselves in the empty disco as if it 's full of people and I tell them all about Judas and how I need to get my rest so that I can get up and run and when I walk into my room I am hoping that my message light will be blinking , that Winston will have called , that somehow he will have gotten my last name and he will tell me that his job is working out but he certainly misses me and he ca n't stand it and even though he does n't get off until like twelve midnight would it be possible , would I mind and not take it the wrong way , but could I just come over and like kiss you good night or something . My phone light is dead red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will never blink . At least not as long as I 'm in this room under the influence because I am truly acting like some lovesick cheerleader who has fallen hard for the quarterback and fucked him in the back seat of his Mustang and he was really just testing the water because his real girlfriend is at another college and he has never even tried to fuck her because he respects her , loves her too much and she is the girl he wants to marry . I slide under the sheets and inhale as many times as I can until I can finally smell Escape and that is what allows me to sleep . This Judas is exactly what I need , I think , as I put on a pair of white shorts and a No Fear T-shirt that says " If You 're Not Living Close to the Edge You 're Taking Up Too Much Space " on the back , and I pick out a pair of ugly white ankle socks , leave my Walkman on the built-in dresser that 's right by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the door and head out toward the beach I have a strong feeling that I 'll be doing quite a bit of listening and talking . Ge could turn out to he a very good distraction . I 'm just  | hoping he can keep me distracted for the next two days when I 'll be like outta here because I 'm really getting tired of this hurry up and stop waiting shit . Judas is standing near a boat that 's parked at the shore . He looks as good today as he did yesterday . ( You blew it , Win-ston . ) When he smiles at me I 'm thinking he could be one of those African gods or something who was sent here to bring me back to reality . Maybe he is the one I was supposed to meet here if I was in fact supposed to meet anybody here and maybe that 's why God saved the best for last . I 'm feeling lucky to be alive as we say our good mornings and begin to run down the deserted beach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , when you 've been an athlete all your life you sort of get used to training so I 've just never stopped . I run an average of five miles a day , depending on my schedule , " and he says it like " shedjule . " By the time we reach the end where I usually turn around he has pretty much told me his life story which is very interesting but not as interesting as say looking at his body and I guess you could say we 've bonded but we are both also sweating up a storm . I am feeling like Bo Fucking Derek in that movie 10 even though like most black women in America I hated Bo 's guts for stealing our braids and having the nerve to put extensions and beads in and for thinking she was all that . We were like , Ca n't we have anything to ourselves ? and of course when white women imitate us they are considered ultrabeautiful and can get on TV and sell cars but since we are just being our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judas walks into or on top of the water I find myself following him as if I 'm sleepwalking and I walk right up to him and press my breasts against his chest and then I turn my head to the side and stare at his beautiful chocolate How Stella Got Her Groove Back 163  | lips and then I lay my lips across his because I can tell he is hoping for a kiss and he kisses me tenderly and strongly and I 'm like shocked because until very recently the only man who has kissed me like this has been Winston and I am like , Damn , maybe there are more of them out here than I ever imagined and so when he puts his arms around me and I feel everything on him rising and pretty much pushing me out of the way I am like amazed and my breasts are throbbing and I want to know how it is possible to throb for one man on say a Friday and then throb for another on what day is it now ? I am sinking low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet I am enjoying every single minute of it . But then I suddenly feel weird about this whole ordeal and when I open my eyes and realize that he is not Winston I say , " We should stop , " because I think maybe I 'm just doing this on-the-rebound stuff to appease my achy breaky little heart . I feel stupid for thinking about Winston out here in this ocean with this fine-ass man but I also feel as if I 'm misleading him and once again misrepresenting myself but then again he does feel good and I am on vacation and I am single and he is single and we are here and Winston is gone so as we head back toward the hotel I relax a little bit and agree to go dancing with him tonight after dinner . It is not the same . He has no rhythm and as someone from Africa he really should be ashamed of himself . I am actually embarrassed for him and embarrassed to be out here on this dance floor watching him move like some white boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old that I do n't care if a man is n't a good dancer . Winston is smooth and sort of glides whereas old Judas here is doing some kind of quivering and jerking  | number and he 's looking at me as if I 'm like edible and when they play " Shy Guy " I look at him and he is not Winston and then I feel overwhelmed all over again and I say to Judas , " Would you mind if we leave ? " and of course he 's all game and everything and we go outside and sit on a bench and he talks some more and I simply am unable to hear him and yet I respond like I 'm checking off answers in a box . He is not a very good substitute . In fact he is rather boring . He represents all that I am trying to get away from . Despite his sexy accent he reminds me of my ex-husband because he is so impressed by how much he appears to be impressing me with his impressive credentials , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these banana trees that belong to Winston that one of the things I like about Winston is that he has no skills and told me so and he did not try to impress me or pretend he could do more than what he does which is basically cook . He is who he is and I like who he is . I realize this as I look over at Judas who should really think about changing his fucking name which at first I was trying to overlook but now I realize that perhaps it 's appropriate because obviously he merely wants to fuck me and for that reason and that reason alone I find myself taking him by the hand and leading him to my hotel room just to see for sure and sure enough he thinks he 's a real Don Juan or somebody because he pulls me close to him immediately and he is like as hard as a cannon and before I know it he is kissing me and snatching my clothes off like in some porno movie instead of like in a romance novel which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I simply hand him one of my condoms and he is banging me very hard and he thinks he is really rocking my world but it 's only the bed he 's rocking . When he says , " Say fuck me Ju-das ! " and then starts slapping me on my ass like I 'm some How Stella Got Her Groove Back 165  | stallion and he 's trying to get me to giddy up I look at this motherfucker like he 's losing his mind and I get up and grab my bathrobe and stand in front of the door and fling it open and say , " Please leave , " and he says , " I only wanted to please you , Stella , and if I was too rough I can do it softer slower because I can see that you are the type who likes it softer and slower , " and he sits there smiling and not budging and I say , " Judas , this was a mistake . I 'm not really this loose . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appreciate it if you would leave now , " and he gets up slowly and walks toward me with his big black penis standing straight out and as he walks into the bathroom the tip of it hits my arm and I am about to throw up if he does n't hurry up and Winston where are you ? I think as I look out at his banana trees and our fuchsia flowers and then I hear the rustle of material as Mr. Jesus Traitor slides into his pants and slips on his shirt and he takes his time putting on his shoes and he walks up to me and says , " I 'm sorry if you are offended in any way and I would very much like to make it up to you . Here is my card , " and he hands it to me . " If you are ever in Atlanta , please look me up , " and I say , " I do n't really like Atlanta , " which is a total lie , and he says , " If you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want to say , Sure , in my next life , and he is winking at me as I step back to avoid what appears to be an oncoming kiss and now he is smiling as if saying , I 'll get you next time , and I close the door and go sit on the edge of the bed like an old tired whore .  | I FEEL BAD . MAYBE I WAS TOO HARD ON JUDAS IS what I 'm thinking after I wake up this morning and get ready to put on my jogging clothes then change my mind fast . I 'm tired of running on the beach . This is my last day here . I have run on that beach every single morning I 've been here and besides I do not want to run into him this morning . In fact I do n't want to see Mr. Freak of the Week for the duration of my stay if it 's at all possible . I order room service and afterwards walk down to say goodbye to ' Ionya and Patrice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and all that and give each other How Stella Got Her Groove Bach 167  | hugs and then I come back to my room to consider packing but it 's too drab in here and I still have the whole day so I decide to go snorkeling since I have n't really done much of the free or I should say paid-for-in-advance activities that have been readily available to me . I snorkel snorkel and snorkel some more . The fish are beautiful and the coral reefs are unbelievable which is of course why people snorkel . I see every color and shape of fish imaginable and even when I snorkeled in Maui it was n't quite this intense immediate close-up pretty . I want to touch the plants because they are swooning and swaying and look as though they are reaching up to the surface of the water but we are not supposed to touch the coral because some of them , most of them , are still alive and could die from being handled by human hands and I think it 's pretty fucking amazing that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could like just die . My ears feel like they 're plugged with foam and it seems like the water is holding me together in one piece and when I look down at a thousand purple and yellow baby fish all headed in one direction I want to follow them but I feel as if I am cutting through their backyard without permission so I steer my body away and flap my fins back and forth until I see the rudder of the boat I came out here on . The water is quite warm and really only ten feet deep even though we are a mile or more from the shoreline . I could stay out here for hours I think as I take my mask and mouthpiece off and accidentally swallow a mouthful of salt water but I do n't really care because I am like totally buoyant .  | Instead of going to the regular beach , for some strange unconscious unknown or unplanned reason I find myself heading toward the nude beach and I tell myself that it 's mostly to avoid Judas . I have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaid I think ugly , like parochial school plaid , but this is a pretty hot bathing suit , though the cheapest of the bunch , and it does wonders for my figure even without any Wonderbra features inside the cups . These people really ought to go somewhere and hide instead of flaunting all this flesh out in the open is what I 'm thinking and I stop dead in my tracks before my foot even touches the sand . They are all mostly pink though some are darker than I am and there are plenty of large firm breasts in the air but I try to ignore all these people as I pass them even though I can feel them staring at me wondering why on earth I am wearing this plaid one-piece bathing suit and when I see old man Nate sit up I am afraid to look at him too closely but see patches of brittle gray hair all over his spotty chest and his arms are a pretty reddish-brown and he is looking at me and waving and I simply wave back and stop at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten feet from an old fat slovenly white man who is sucking on a cold pipe . His wife who was probably a knockout in her younger years is reading a Jude Deveraux paperback and wearing a big floppy straw hat and she is as naked as everybody else out here and her breasts are the same size as her stomach which suffice it to say is humongous and she has these purple veins running all over her body like a map of major interstates or something . I sort of stand there for a minute and look out at the ocean which looks exactly like the ocean around the bend where everybody is wearing a bathing suit and I find myself sliding my straps down and  | then stepping out of my suit and the sun feels good on my ass and breasts and shoulders and I walk toward the beach with both hands covering my breasts and then I turn around and face the folks on the beach and for no reason at all I squeeze them and smile at that white man . Yes , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife who is gazing at me too as if she once looked even better than I do right now and then there is old man Nate who is like salivating and this tiny section of the beach is gaping with their socalled liberated and **30;0;TOOLONG little eyes and it is not really because I am all that gorgeous . The deal is that I am the only black woman on this beach because most black people only run around butt naked in Africa where we are in front of our own people and where it is the normal thing to do and nobody really gives a shit . I stay in the water for just a few minutes and when I get out Nate is heading in my direction but I run to grab my towel before he gets close enough for me to see his elephantsize unit which is rather atrocious and scary-looking . I would never need this much dick is what I 'm thinking as I cover myself . " Now why you have to go and do that ? " he asks . " Do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here to be hassled . " " I 'm just glad to see you here , " he says , standing there ever so proudly . I look down . " You do n't seem to be as glad as you say you are , " and I begin to walk away . " Why you leaving so soon and you just got here , girl ? " " Because I 'm tired and this is boring . " All he can do is nod .  | I eat lunch with the Canadians and even though they still have almost a whole week left to honeymoon they are clearly becoming either bored with each other or tired of hangovers , this island or captivity at the Castle Beach . I tell them how much I have enjoyed them and I Dream of Jeannie smiles at me and tells me , " So much meeting you fun , Stella ! " Ben says he ca n't wait to get back to work because he misses laying tiles and cutting marble and granite and limestone and just for the hell of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says she is a dancer . What kind of dancer ? I ask and he blushes and makes swirling motions with his hands in front of his chest and rolls them down underneath the table and I say , Nude dancing ? and he says , Well , actually she 's a stripper , and my eyes go big and when I turn to I Dream of Jeannie she is nodding and smiling and says , " Yes , very much so ! " I want to tell him that this girl should go back to school . I take a taxi into town and spend hours at the marketplace , where almost everything they sell seems to be black red and green or made of wood but I buy a small sculpture hats skirts T-shirts shorts more T-shirts bracelets gold earrings Jamaican cookbooks at least twenty Jamaican CDs and postcards from the local merchants to show my support for their entrepreneurial endeavors on this island which I recently discovered is still mostly owned by the British .

As I drag all my clothes out of the closet and put them on my bed I realize I do n't know where or how I am ever going to get all this shit into my . suitcases . I decide to write out my postcards so at least they are postmarked from Jamaica and not Miami which is where my plane has to stop for a two-hour layover , and I choose the one from Rick 's Cafe where two young men are caught in midair jumping off the highest cliff and I decide to send this one to Quincy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I come up with something else for everybody else 's postcards  --  Angela 's , Vanessa 's , a few close friends and one person and one person only at my job  --  and then the phone rings . It startles me because I have n't actually heard it ring in days . " Is that Stella there ? " the voice that sounds like silk is asking . " Winston ? " I say and all of a sudden my heart is beating a thousand beats per minute . " Hell0000 , " he sings . " How are you ? " " I 'm fine , " I say . " And you ? " " Fine . Working very hard . But say , are you still leaving tomorrow ? " " Yes . Early . " I drop the postcards on the bed . " Well , I would really like to see you to say goodbye before you leave , Stella .

" " I just have to shower and then I could come right over . " I look at my watch . It is four thirty-five . " And what time might that be , because I 'm supposed to have dinner with some friends this evening . " " Do I know them ? " " I do n't know , Winston . What difference does it make ? " " Are you all right , Stella ? Did I do something ? " " No , Winston , but I 'm just really surprised to hear from you because your friend Norris has been saying you 've been by here and he 's been making me feel really silly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came by once to drop off his key but I was only there for a few minutes and I asked him if he 'd seen you around anywhere and he said no and I did n't know your last name and the front desk would n't give it to me and Norris said he had no way of finding out so finally I called Abby and asked if she would get it for me and she did and I 've been calling you since yesterday but you 're never in your room . " " Why did n't you leave a message ? " " Can we talk about it when I get there , because I have to be back by six . " " Okay , " I say and feel foolish for sounding like his mother .

" Can you meet me at the front gate at five past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case you forgot what I look like , " I say , laughing . " That 's my whole problem , " he says . " I 've been trying hard not to remember . " " And ? " " It 's not working . I 'll see you soon . " How Stella Got Her Groove Sack 173  | I pay sixty dollars for a pass so that Winston can come through the gate of the Castle Beach Negril and spend what will probably amount to only forty-five minutes . But I need to see him . I want to see him . If I do n't , I feel like my trip wo n't have any real closure . Of course I know I want to sleep with him again but not under these circumstances because I would feel cheap and I do n't want him to think for a minute that that is the main reason I want to see him and that that is the only thing I can think of to do with him when all we have is forty-five minutes . I already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know as I stand there in my yellow shorts and yellow top , and when I see him come around that hedge in a deep pink shirt and those long purple shorts and he is wearing thick black sneakers with white socks he is so beautiful and he is already blushing and I can smell him before he gets close enough to touch me and he looks at me like he 's dreaming and bends down out in the open and kisses me and I am never going to be able to forget him , that much I know already . " You look very nice in yellow , " he says and takes me by the elbow and I am feeling like he has made it back safely from the war and now I 'm on my way to a convent or something . " Are you cooking up a storm ? " " Not really , " he says . " Mostly chopping and cutting , slicing and dicing . You know ? " " I think I know .

" So you 're really leaving , huh ? " Yep . Maxi Priest is singing something lovely and mellow about keeping promises or breaking them , one of the two , but all I know is that I ca n't believe Winston is really standing here in my room until he comes toward me and stops and looks down and says , " Stella , I want you to know how sad I am to see you leave , " with the utmost sincerity and I am afraid to look into his eyes because I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over some young guy I just met on some island and I am feeling all mushy inside because I may never see him again and the mere thought of that is making me ache but I gather my composure and try to act like a real grown-up .

" " Because I like you , Winston . " " In what manner do you like me ? " He is serious about this . I can see it all over his face . " I like you the way a woman likes a man . " He seems satisfied with this answer and then he sighs and stands up real tall and says , " I 'm here because I had to come , not because I wanted to . Because I had to . " " And what does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at a blank wall and then through the curtains out at the waves and then How Stella Got Her Groove Sack 175  | back at me and says , " It means I have these feelings and I do n't know what to call them but I do know that they are unusually strong and I 've never felt this way before . " " Join the club , " I say . " You feel it too ? " " Do I ever . " And then we both sort of sigh a sigh of relief and he bends down and rubs his cheekbone against my cheekbone and sort of just holds me for the longest time and I hold him and we merge again for the second time and then he kisses me deeply and slowly so slowly and his lips are so warm and my lips are so warm that they become sympathetic toward each other until this moment begins to feel sacred and no way can I leave this man on this island , and I drop my face down and press it into his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fold you up and put you in my suitcase , " and he rubs his big hands up and down my back and he says , " I wish I could fold myself up and jump inside your suitcase . " And then we just sort of stand there and rock back and forth for what apparently is more than a few minutes because I notice my clock says it is five forty-five even though he just got here . We break away from each other and I say , " So , Winston , what do you want to do ? " " I hope to be able to see you again . " " I 'm not so sure about that , " I say . " Why ? You can come back , ca n't you ? " " I could , one day , but I have a job , Winston , and a son . " " I know . I could come visit you and your son . " " You just started a new job , Winston .

" He is blushing again and I 'm not so sure he knows what he 's saying when he blurts out , " I want to make as many deposits as I can with you , " and then he starts laughing and says , " I did n't mean that the way it sounded . " I am laughing too and I want to keep on laughing but we stop . We stop basically to hug each other again and I say something really stupid like , " Winston , I wish you were , say , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He lets me go and looks as if I 've wounded him with some blunt instrument . " Well , " he says , " I 'm not thirty and I wo n't be thirty for nine whole years , so what exactly am I supposed to do about that , Stella ? " " You know what I 'm saying , Winston . " " No , what are you saying , Stella ? " " I 'm saying that even though I feel like I 'm totally smitten by you and everything , and if this were a perfect world we could do this , even take this to another level for real , but the world is not perfect and Winston you are too young for me and I 'm too old for you and that 's the reality of the situation . " He sucks on his lips . I would like to kiss them one more time for the road but that would make things even more hazardous than they already are . " Well , we can still be friends , right ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asks . He is still weighing my answer the way I am weighing his question and I wish it were n't like this but it is and what would I , how would we , how could we , we could n't , How Stella Got Her Groove Back 177  | and so I say , " Winston , I 'll walk you out to the gate if you want me to . " " You do n't have to , " he says at first and goes over to the door and then he turns toward me and he looks dejected and remorseful and I realize that truly I am not the only one who has fallen over the edge I am not the only one who has got it bad and so I say , " I know I do n't have to . " " You look kind of busy . Packing and everything , " he says . " Would you like me to ? " I ask . He looks me dead in the eye and says , " I 'd love you to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , but I want you to know that I 'm not good at goodbyes so after we say it , when I say run ' let 's both just run , okay ? " " Are you serious ? " he says , laughing . " I 'm serious , " I say . " That 's one of the things I like about you , Stella . " " What 's that ? " " You 're always serious but you still make me laugh . " So we walk down that path again and Winston has his arm around me like I 'm his woman and not his mother and we walk out toward the front gate but on the way we pass his friend Norris who looks like he is in shock to see us as if his scheme not only failed but actually backfired and like a lady I do not throw this in his face I simply smile and Winston and I both say hello and then we pass old man Nate coming out of the gift shop and he pretends he does n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seem to run into every-fucking-body else who 's staying at the Castle Beach Negril and Winston does n't seem to mind and when we walk out that front gate when we cross that invisible wire fence I do not feel like I am being electrocuted until I kiss him and turn to run back across it .  | I CAN NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF THAT TWO-HOUR van ride on that bumpy road back to the airport , which is why I am up here in the sky with twenty-seven-year-old Nigel , the pilot , who does n't look old enough to drive a car . This four-passenger airplane that will take approximately fifteen minutes to get me to Montego Bay International is giving me a panoramic view of this part of the island . Now I know why they call them the Blue Mountains , because they are so green they do actually look blue , and in some places the water is emerald green and right next to it like turquoise . It looks unreal but I have swum in that water . I feel flow Stella Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here every summer . As we descend and the tires screech down the runway , I decide that if things continue the way they have been for me at work I might just buy some beach property here , and as I get off the little plane and wait to get my boarding pass and pay my departure tax and sit and wait sit and wait sit and wait to get on that 727 , I think I will . Someone up here is wearing Escape . I look around . I ca n't tell who it might be . I close my eyes and remember that Quincy will be home in a few days and think how much I 'm looking forward to seeing my son . I like being away from him but I sure love it when he 's there . If I had to be any-body 's mother I 'm grateful to be his . I 'm hoping I feel this way when he 's like fourteen which I 've been told is the age that you begin to want not only to disown them but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that they should just dig a gigantic hole somewhere at the end of the earth and bury every single teenager in the world until they 're at least twenty and then let them out to get on with their lives . We land in Miami in less than an hour . I really despise this airport . It is like a zoo . People from all over the world look like they 're not of this world and no one seems to be able to speak English and everybody looks confused and you simply can not find a free telephone and they are well hidden anyway . Customs is a total drag and I lie and say I spent two hundred dollars when in fact I spent more like two thousand but who can remember everything and filling out that form takes forever and as I 'm walking through the airport I notice on the counter of the duty-free shop bottles of cologne and I walk in and ask the East Indian guy if they have Escape by Calvin Klein and he says yes but you are American so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to smell it because someone told me about it so he gets the bottle from a glass case and looks at me suspiciously as I take one long whiff and yes it smells just like Winston and I say May I ? pointing it toward my wrist , and he nods Go ahead , and I press the top down and the mist lands on a big patch of my arm and I tell the man thank you and on the flight from Miami to San Francisco I sleep for three hours with my wrist placed close to my nose . Even though it 's ten o'clock at night , my house looks bigger and better . I do n't get it . It 's the same house . Phoenix ca n't seem to stop wagging that big brown tail , he 's so happy to see me . I rub his ears briskly and pet him . Dr. Dre is blocking the doorway so that I have to pick her up before I can even think about walking inside . Our cat is a she but we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named her . The very same driver who took me to the airport last week picked me up and is now carrying all three of my bags , which are even heavier than they were . I give him a fortydollar tip because he will probably need the money to pay for the pulled whatever he 'll get thanks to my Jamaican shopping spree . I open all the windows in my bedroom and turn on the ceiling fan . It is pretty in here . I painted it a pale salmon because I wanted it to feel warm especially when it 's cold outside . I have twenty-six messages so I sit on the bed and fast-forward through all of them , jotting down a few names and numbers and erasing all but five which I save and am now listening to as I unpack . One of them is from my socalled boss . " Stella , you need to call me at home as soon as p 181 you get back from vacation . There 's a bit of a problem and it needs to be resolved right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fucking problem ? And why is he calling me at home ? I have n't even unpacked and already the bullshit is starting . " Hey , Stella , this is Maisha calling . Girl , I hope you have n't forgotten about my gallery opening . Remember you promised me , Tiger and Rudy that you 'd be here . Tiger 's expecting Quincy . So be here or be square . " " We 'll be there , " I say to the machine . I love Maisha . I love Rudy and I love Tiger . They are a family and a happy one . Maisha and Rudy are one of the few couples I know who 've been married for like a trillion years and are still very much in love . They still make each other smile and they each brag about how smart and talented and wise and tender the other one is and how lucky each is to have met the other and they actually look happy and if it 's a front then I say both of them deserve Academy Awards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples like them  --  which is not very often  --  I watch their spirits their amiability their genuine affection and respect for each other emanate from them and permeate the entire room and my faith is kind of restored for a little while until , say , I come home and hear a message like the next one . Leroy was the person I used to call when I needed sex . We had this understanding . We tried to be there for each other in times of need . Leroy had forgotten how to love and show affection and wanted me to teach him . He was a slow learner in this area though in fact he is a genuine genius and has an IQ of like a thousand or something . He knows a lot about everything , which is sort of his problem . He 's too smart and has no real outlets in which to channel his energy . I was one of the recipients of this energy for a while and Leroy  | fascinated me because for a change I 'd met a man who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in centuries because he stopped satisfying me quite a while back when I discovered by accident that he was an alcoholic , which explained why it took forever for him to get off and when he did , Look out , Stella ! He had me chafed and raw , running to the doctor with a bladder infection from being banged and jabbed ; he behaved as if he hated me instead of wanting me and finally I decided why even bother ? On my machine , he is slurring , and I guess when you 're drunk you do n't know you 're slurring and you do n't even suspect that other people know you 're drunk . He manages to get out : " Stella , this is Leroy . Where are you ? Why have n't you called ? I 've been thinking about you so much these past couple of nights , Beverly , and I 'm in the car going over the bridge and , Debs , can I stop by just for a few minutes ? Are you going to be home in say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no way of telling me that , do you ? Oh well . It 's been nice talking to your machine anyway . Call me at the office . Bye . " And I yell to the machine , " Take your drunk ass home to your wife ! " I feel sorry for her , to be honest , but then again I do n't . She knows he fools around and yet she tolerates it because they are  --  or he is  --  filthy rich since he owns every kind of franchise you can think of and he thinks because he 's rich and handsome he is totally irresistible which is not true because he does not know when to stop . Does n't know that life is not one big rush . It should be peaceful sometimes . Should be a whisper and not always a scream . Leroy believes that love can be purchased if you can afford to pay . He buys his wife anything and everything she wants and has for the last twenty years and it is so sad to me that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the quality of  | their lives and are still subjecting themselves to humiliation just to keep driving those fancy cars living in those humongous houses with rooms no one ever enters and is it really worth it ? It is downright pathetic if you ask me but nobody has asked me and I am like talking to myself so get a grip , Stella . " I know you must 've lost your mind or something , Stella , because Vanessa told me that you slept with a teenager in Jamaica and that you actually like him . You must be going through some kind of midlife crisis ; that 's what you 're probably going through . Well , shoot , I know a lady you can talk to about this , so call me . " Fuck you , Angela ! I 'm going to kill Vanessa ! " Stella , do n't be too peeved at me but I accidentally slipped and told Angela about what you did on your summer vacation . It just sort of rolled off my tongue but to be honest I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dead-ass world and I just really wanted to fuck with her cause I knew she could n't handle this so let me know if any of your animals are dead and when can I like come over and pick up me and Chantel 's gifts and souvenirs and I hope you did n't just send us a stupid postcard . I also have something to tell you . Byee . And by the way : welcome home . " Nothing like sisters , I think as I begin to unpack , and as I hold up different articles of clothing I wore when I was with Winston I feel myself getting woozy and it is then that I realize for the umpteenth time that he was not is not a dream a mere fantasy , that he really did generate something pure and deep inside me that is still circulating now that I 'm home , and even though I am in my very own bedroom and there are no waves outside my window and no rocks and no banana plants or hibiscus , I can smell the flowers hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of have to  | shake my head back and forth to stop myself from hearing his knock on my door from seeing him standing there in the rain from feeling his lips against mine and as I pull more clothes from the suitcase , separating soiled laundry from things that need to go to the dry cleaners , I know for a fact that this longing this yearning I 'm feeling is because I am missing him . " Yes , Isaac , this is Stella calling . What 's going on ? " " Well , first of all , how was Jamaica ? " " It was great . Negril is a beautiful part of the island . " " When 'd you get back ? " " Late last night . " " That 's good , " he says . " Glad to hear you had a great time . I 've always wanted to see Jamaica . Been to Aruba , but have n't had a chance to get to Jamaica yet . Ah , look , Stella , there 's a reason I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Isaac ? " " Well , I could have waited till you came back to the office and we could talk face-to-face , but I thought I 'd forewarn you . A lot has happened since you 've been away . " " Would you get to the point , Isaac , and stop beating around the bush ? " " Well , Stella , you know there 's been talk for some time about downsizing and reorganizing your department , right ? " " Of course . Everybody knows that . It 's no secret . " " Well , Fred has been replaced by Michael Javitz ? " " Javitz from our Los Angeles office ? " " Yes . " " And ? " " He 's set on starting his department with a new team . " p 185 " Wait a minute , Isaac  --  are you saying what I think you 're saying ? " " I did n't want to do it like this , Stella . I mean you and I go way back .... " " So are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess that 's what I 'm trying to say . " " You 've got ta be kidding me . " " Javitz feels that he really ca n't justify your salary . " " Oh , really ! As much revenue as I bring into the firm , he ca n't justify my salary ? " " Stella , you 've had the same accounts now for some time and we 're trying to grow . New clients are just as valuable as long-standing ones . " " I do n't believe this . " " You know how things can get at this level . " " And what level is that , Isaac ? What level is that ? " " We 're offering you a great severance package . A year 's salary plus a bonus and most of your benefits . You can even keep your profit sharing . " " So are you saying I have to accept this ? " " Well , it 's what we 're offering .

But I do n't know what I 'm supposed to do now . How I 'm supposed to feel . And who can I ask ? And even if I did , what difference would it make ? I am going to have to start over . Somewhere else . Start over . Start all over . Again .

In fact as I go through the mail most of which is junk and then dash upstairs to the laundry room and begin to throw all my running outfits into the washer I can not wipe the smirk off my face because I am now rather ecstatic that I no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens for a reason and maybe I 'm being given another chance maybe this is really an opportunity to venture out in a different direction which is why I am going to pay attention this time out because what I am certain of is that for the first time in like seventeen years I am totally and unequivocally free !

I am in the backyard on my knees digging holes in the ground and poking little flowers inside each one and the soil is soft and cool even through these gloves and deciding which flowers to put where and how to group them becomes important to me and I get up from time to time to stand back and look at the pattern or lack of pattern these tiny bouquets are beginning to make and I enjoy how much livelier the yard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been out here now for more than two hours until I hear what sounds like the engine of my car pulling into the driveway and the phone ringing at the same time .

" Okay , cut the bullshit . Your bad news ca n't be any worse than what I 've just gotten . " " What ? " " I am no longer employed . " " Get the hell out of here ? " she says , looking around the truck to make sure Chantel is inside the house . " Yep . They pulled this shit on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ? " " Everybody always wants to sue somebody . I do n't have the time or the energy but I 'll be getting what 's mine . I 'm not even worried about it . " " Wow , this is like totally fucked up , Stella . What a way to come home from vacation . " " I 'm not really all that upset about it if you want to know the truth . " " I 'm checking you out . You seem too calm , at least that 's what I think I 'm hearing in your voice . Are you on something ? " " No , I 'm not on anything . Spare me . Now tell me what your bad news is . " " Promise you wo n't be too mad at me ? " " What is it , Vanessa ? " " Wait up .

" " This stupid son-of-a-bitch was n't even looking where he was going when I was trying to back out of this parking space and like pow ! I tapped him . " " No problem . " " You mean you 're not pissed ? " " It 's just a stupid little accident . Did anybody get hurt ? " She looks as if she does n't quite believe this because I do have a reputation for being high-strung , for " going off , " but only if I 'm provoked , and occasionally for not being the most understanding when it comes to sensitive emotional issues . Or at least that 's the word out on the street . " No . Nobody got hurt , " she says very slowly . " Girl , what has gotten into you ? You ai n't tripping and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a stupid car . It can be fixed . What 's the big deal ? " Then she starts laughing . " That young boy musta really done something to you . Look at me , Stella . " After she says this I ca n't because I feel myself blushing and I ca n't hide it with these dirty gloves on so I drop my face and then Vanessa runs over to me and lifts my chin up and says , " What has happened to you ? " I try my damnedest to wipe the smirk off my face and I say , " Nothing . And your check 's on the kitchen counter . Go get it . " " You did n't go down there and fall in love with a twenty-one-year-old , did you , Stella ? " " Are you crazy ? " " No . I 'm not crazy . Are you ?

" " That 's not even what I 'm talking about and you know it , Stella . You did fall in love with him , did n't you ? Tell the truth . " " Would you stop it , Vanessa . You do n't even know what you 're talking about . " " Well , answer me this . How do you feel ? " " I feel good , as James Brown would say , " and I start laughing . " Cut the bullshit , Stella . Tell me . " " Okay , I feel something . I do n't know what it is , but all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I have in years . I feel like , like I could plant every flower in the world in my backyard today . " She is smiling at me . " Whew . " She sighs . " Well , just keep this to yourself . Let it be your business . " " I am , " I say . " Now what 's the good news ? " " Oh . The good news is that when I had the accident you know I was on my way to Reno with my girl Cassandra who I work with and to be totally honest I had my mind on my money and my money on my mind but I won three hundred and sixty bucks playing the slots ! " " That 's your good news . Where 's mine ? " " What 's mine is yours , is n't it , Sis ? " " No . And we 're not even going that far , " and I turn to head toward the backyard . " Wait a minute , girl ! Take those stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says and pushes me in the flow Stella Got tier Groove Back 193  | other direction . " And you better not hadda bought us no cheap shit and I hope you 've got some champagne in here cause it 's hot as hell out here and not only that but it 's summertime and the living is easy and I want you to tell me all about Jamaica and this young man of yours . I 'm serious . I want to know what a twenty-one-year-old boy can do for a forty-two-year-old woman that would make her look five years younger in a single week and she comes home and not be pissed after hearing that her sister has wrecked her sixty-thousand-dollar car and she still lends her a thousand big ones and she finds out that she is fired from her megabucks job that I certainly wish I had and yet she is still as cool as a cucumber . I want to hear it all , " she says and puts her hands on her hips . " Blow  --  by  --  blow . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUT A MEATBALL , " I SAY TO myself as I begin to pack up three of those stupid computers that have taken up so much room in my home office which while I 'm at it I decide to redecorate repaint in fact I should like move altogether and just build a-whole-nother house ! This notion flies right out the window of course because now I have no job and thank the Lord my mother taught me how to save my allowance for a rainy day which has been reincarnated and come back as tax-free municipal bonds and it was one of the few things Mania told me to do that I actually did and I am also grateful that years ago I made sonic solid How Stella Got Her Groove Back 195  | investments in a now-famous coffee company and a very popular consumer shopping establishment that I frequent myself but do not get any special discounts at and thanks to Leroy who despite whatever shortcomings he may have physically emotionally and spiritually does have mucho business savvy and did n't mind sharing some of it with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him which against my better judgment I went ahead and did but only after he promised me that even if I stopped sleeping with him that should n't stop us from making money together which made perfect sense to me and he kept his word so I am like a major shareholder and part owner of a number of thriving fast-food soft-drink enterprises which I prefer not to name . Plus I 'm also not stupid . One of the primary and most important lessons you learn in securities is how to cover your own ass first . Why would I spend all my time and energy showing other folks how to make money if I did n't myself ? My mentors always stressed the fact that as soon as you make more than enough to earn a living , start making a living . Put a small percentage of your income somewhere it 'll grow faster than the speed of light and just like playing in Vegas take a risk but never risk more than you can afford to lose and then take some of that hard-won money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have to stress over how it 's performing but the goal is to have all of your investments spread out over into everything from umbrella insurance policies to stocks so that if you ever lose your job or even die your bills are covered your ass is covered your children are taken care of and so I took their advice and if I were to say die today or something my portfolio is set up so that after everything is paid off whoever inherits my property and possessions wo n't even have to pay any  | inheritance tax . So unlike some of these hotsy-totsy movie stars athletes rappers and rock and roll stars who spend all their money on expensive cars clothes mansions and go bankrupt from excessing , I will not . Over the past five years or so I followed my own tips which basically means that I can afford not to work for the next two and a half to three years without freaking out . I will however verify and confirm this with my accountant my broker and by reviewing my own portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me before , that I have actually been in a position not to work , but I guess it 's because I 've just always worked and besides I always thought what I was doing meant something to somebody , that I provided a valuable and unique service of some kind , but apparently what they say is true : you can always be replaced . But you know what ? Fuck ' em . I am also very much aware that I do n't have a clue as to what I 'm going to do to take the place of my job . What I do know for certain is that I am not walking through any more revolving doors with a suit on , gripping an attache case . To hell with corporate America where people do n't count but revenue has a pulse and all they do is watch it on an EKG . I give . So the search is on to find a place where I can be me and still make a living even though the truth is I do n't have very many if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I no longer have a job to distract me perhaps I 'll pay closer attention to what used to give me pleasure in a major way . My back and front yards are full of flowers and the roots of my indoor plants now have more than enough room to breathe . I feel like I 'm coming down with something , like a cold or maybe even an ulcer , so I take an Advil and sit around and wait for it to kick in hut when it does I still feel the same way : like I 'm getting sick . I am folding the rest of How Stella Got Her Groove Back 197  | my vacation laundry and beginning to put the last of the shorts and T-shirts into their respective drawers when I find myself dropping them on the bed and calling long distance information and getting the number of the hotel and for fifty cents they connect me and when I hear a Jamaican accent say , " Good afternoon thank you for calling Windswept this is operator Jasmine speaking how may I direct your call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm thinking what a name what a man to have such a name and what a fool I am to be calling him and just as I come to my senses and am considering hanging up I hear his voice say , " Winston Shakespeare here , " and I say , " Hello , Winston , " and let out a sigh . " Is that you there , Stella ? " " Yes , it 's me , " I say , feeling and probably looking pretty much like Jim Caney in Dumb and Dumber . Da . Da . Da . " How are y0000u ? " he sings . " I 'm fine . I 'm home . " " Yes , I know . " " I just called to say hello , Winston . " " Can you hold on a minute while I change to a private phone because I 'm having a hard time hearing you in here . I 'll only be a second . Do n't go anywhere please . " " Okay , " I say and stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feel stupid because what am I going to say to him : Winston I ca n't seem to stop thinking about you and i any one step away from buying my very own bottle of Escape for Men and spraying it all over my pillows and sheets so that I can just inhale you at night and I miss you so much it is driving me crazy and I 'm just wondering if you 're feeling anything close to what I 'm feeling I mean were you like as affected as I was I mean are you like having trouble thinking and connecti ng the dots unless you are the dots and what am I what are we going to do about this because you and 1  | both know this is ridiculous I am too old for you and you are too young for me and it would never work how would could we do this to make it work oh it would never work so let 's just forget it ? " Stella , are you still there ? " " Yes , I 'm still here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am touched . " For real ? " " Yes , and you know I 've been feeling very strange lately and I seem not to have any pep in my step if you know my meaning and everybody has been saying to me , Winston , man , what 's wrong with you ? ' and I did n't know at first what they were talking about but then it dawned on me that I am feeling very depressed and it hit me that I did n't start feeling like this until after you left . S000 , I 'm telling you that I miss you , Stella . " My heart hurts . It is sinking and burning and dropping fast into the cave of my stomach and then all of a sudden I simply feel hot . I am coming down with something for sure and it 's on the other end of this phone . That much I have figured out . " I miss you too , Winston , " I say . " More than you will ever know . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's rather ridiculous really . " " It 's not so ridiculous , Stella . " And then there is like this silence and then some more silence and then he says , " Stella ? " And I say , " Yes ? " " I want you to know that I had the best time of my whole life when I was with you . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Winston . But we did n't really spend that much time together when you really think about it . " How Stella Got Her Groove Back 199  | " Precisely . " I hear him breathing and I believe I can smell him through this telephone and for certain I can see his lips move when he says , " I really hope I can see you again , Stella . " My shoulders drop my chest collapses my whole torso falls forward until my face is dangling close to the floor , and I hear myself whimpering , " I feel the same way , Winston . " This is like too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in here behaving like I 'm seventeen . " Mine feels rather urgent , though . " " Mine too , " I say . Dork . Dork . " And I was thinking . " " What ? " " I was thinking that maybe in three months ' time I can take a sick leave and come to California to visit you for a week or two . How does that sound ? " Here ? He wants to come here ? I like this idea a lot . I like it a whole lot but three months is a very long time and a woman could shrivel up in three months when she is like craving something and ca n't have it but then again I am trying to learn to be a more patient person and what a way to test myself and besides the most important thing right now is that I am not in this alone . It is not just me who has been bitten thank the Lord it 's not just me . " I 'd really like that , Winston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much I 'd like that . " " I 'm going to look into it , " he says . " Well , do you like your job ? " " It 's good . I 'm learning more and more each day . I could become a head chef after perhaps a year of apprenticing although it would do me good to get more training , but this is tine for right now as I 'm gaining experience . " " What about your living quarters ? "  | " Well , it 's okay . I sleep on a twin-sized bed and I have a roommate . He 's okay but it 's kind of cramped , you know , but it 'll have to do as this is the way it is at every resort when you come on board like this . " " Do you have a TV ? " " No . " " Stereo ? " " Are you kidding ? " " Refrigerator ? " " No . " " Then what ? " " I told you , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your personal belongings and that 's it . " " So it 's sort of like living in a college dormitory . " " Exactly , " he says . " And your son , how is he ? " " He 's still visiting his dad . " " And where is he again ? " " Colorado . " " In the Rockies , is he ? " I giggle . " Yes , sort of . He comes home Saturday morning and I ca n't wait to see him . " " It 's nice having a son , hey ? " " Very . At least I like the one I have . " He laughs . " I hope to meet him soon . " Wow . The thought of Winston meeting Quincy kind of wigs me out for a minute because what would I say to my child : " Quincy I want you to meet Mom 's new boyfriend who can not vote or buy liquor in America and no he 's not going to be your stepdad but how about thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ask me about his age but yes he will probably be willing to play Sega and Super NES with you , no problem , mon ! " You 'd like Quincy , " I say for lack of anything better . How Stella Got Her Groove Back 201  | " So what have you been doing since you 've been home ? " I want to say getting fired and constantly thinking about you , but of course I do n't , and instead I say , " Well , I 've been planting flowers and making some career decisions . " " What 's that again ? " " I 'll write and tell you all about it . " " Will you ? " " I will . " " It feels good to hear your voice , Stella . You just do n't know . Can you tell I 'm smiling ? " What is so weird is that I actually can tell but what 's even weirder is how much I know I must sound like some teenybopper . I have to cover my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it and then and only then am I able to say , " I 'm smiling too , Winston . " " So you will write ? " " I promise , " I say , and when I hang up the phone I am like ga-ga-ga-ga and I think about that stupid article I read on the plane and I guess we are sort of passing by the fling stage because we are speaking to each other on the phone and he has already written me a postcard and he has just said he wants to see me again and Lord what I would n't pay to feel those lips see those eyes stand within a foot of him and smell him again and it has n't even been a week and that article claimed the socalled cut-off period to determine if your fling was turning into something serious was two . I feel like I should drop the author an I-beg-to-differ-with-you note . I do n't really mean that . I am not even thinking about any article when I lie on the bed stare up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart is spinning and spinning in the opposite direction until I realize that I am feeling suspended comforted soothed as if I have been endorsed . As if for the first time in a long time someone has  | just said to me I like you because you are you and that 's it . It 's just that simple . He has n't asked me where I live or what kind of house I live in or how much money I make or what kind of car I drive none of that bullshit that I am almost always asked by legalized grown-up men and it gets on my nerves every time . It 's funny too that Winston has n't once mentioned his or my age and I wonder if he 's pretending that I 'm not forty-two years old . Maybe he 's forgotten . But what about when he remembers ? Oh who cares . Shit . I like him . He likes me . And I 'm happy about it . That 's what I know right now . And right now it 's enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some reason ( and I do understand the reason because I 'm not completely dense ) I get this surge of energy and put away all my clothes in like one-two-three and then I head for the mall where I plan on buying Quincy a pair of sneakers that fit because his feet have grown again and that new CD by Monica with that song " Just One of Them Thangs " that I absolutely love and Mr. Shaggy Boombastic who is of all things Jamaican and oh yes TLC CrazySexy Cool which I will buy two of because Quincy and I can not share CDs ever since I bought him his own miniature stereo system for his room after he all of a sudden started watching MTV like it was going out of style and even I like Beavis and Butthead every now and then and I 'm not all that worried about my child being badly influenced because he knows from whence he came . And even though the word " fuck " is like my favorite curse word of all time and I use it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully will never hear me use it oh I forgot that time when I was PMSing and he was fixing his go-cart and he had all the tools sitting on top of How Stella Got Her Groove Back 203  | my car which scratched it and put a dent in it and it cost $2,300 to get fixed and I did go off on him and use the F word but he has not even come close to doing anything so costly again without thinking about it first and so I continue to use the F word privately because I use it more for personal reasons like for processing and digesting thoughts for use in front of dear friends and close relatives who also seem to favor its usage . It seems like it was only a few weeks ago that Quincy was watching Nick at Nite and then all of a sudden like overnight switched to MTV Jams hosted by Bill Bellamy which is why he knows what 's up with the latest music and keeps me well informed but he has been begging for TLC and he says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cute and when I told him that she burned down her boyfriend 's house all he said was So I still think she 's pretty cute and I like her , Mom , and all I 'm really grateful for is that this is the first evidence I 've seen of him even noticing girls and I give him credit for having good taste buds and he is like starting from the top and even though I know it may be racist and sexist and I should be ashamed of myself but the fact that she is black kind of pleases me and the fact that she is a she pleases me even more so no problem , mon , is what I 'm thinking as I turn into the mall parking lot and hell I might as well go ahead and get him a few new T-shirts that I 'll hide in his drawers to save so he can " have it going on " at least during his very first week of junior fucking high school . I had n't planned on buying Winston anything so I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locker buying Quincy two pairs of size ten Airwalks and without thinking twice asking the guy if he could bring out a size thirteen of  | these Nike Airs which are hot off the press . I know not what I 'm doing but then again I think maybe I do . The old wives ' tale is that if you buy a man a pair of shoes he will most likely walk away from you . I want Winston to walk away from me . That would be the safest thing . It would also be the smartest thing . This much I do know . But then I go a little crazy . When I go into the music store to get Quincy 's CDs I begin to pick out CDs that I know Winston likes but probably does n't have because he does n't have any money and I must buy about six or seven of them for him : some hip-hoppers of course and some rap and I throw Seal in for good measure and Mary J. Blige and when I get outside the store it occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I decide to get him a portable one with headphones and once in the store I figure I could use one on airplanes but now that I 'm out of a job how often will I actually be flying but then I could also use it at the beach or outside in the backyard and Quincy could use one too when we 're driving up to the mountains and I want silence and he wants Monteil Jordan so I get him a cheap one because he will drop it lose it something and so now we all have CD players . Of course the same thing happens with the T-shirts . I go No Fear crazy too . I get Winston four and Quincy five because after all he is my son . When I see those Kipling backpacks in Macy 's , I remember that Quincy needs a new one so I pick a forest green for him and grab another for Winston , just because . I am walking past the Sunglass Hut and I see those cool mirrored glasses that wrap around your face that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visa card once again but I am like totally enjoying this , this business of doing something for somebody else . I mean Winston has like nothing , and this might make him smile , let him know that someone , that I am thinking about him . I will  | let it be a surprise . But . On the other hand . What if he thinks I 'm doing this to impress him or maybe I 'm trying to buy his affection like that old lady in that Richard Gere gigolo movie . I 'm not that fucking old , so why would he think that , Stella ? And besides , this stuff does n't even add up to my car payment . Angela is sitting on the side porch as I pull into my driveway . She looks upset about something . " You have gone and just completely lost your mind , have n't you ? " " What are you talking about ? " " Do n't play dumb with me , Stella . You must think you 're Diana Ross or Cher or somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , it 's hot as hell out here can I at least go inside my own house and get a glass of ice water while you rant and rave ? " " I did n't come over here to rant and rave whatsoever , " she says , following me inside . " What did you buy ? What 's in all these bags ? " " None of your business , " I say and push all four into the pantry . If she had a life she would n't be so nosy . She sits down at the kitchen table , turns her chair so that it faces me , spreads her legs open and says , " Stella , you are n't serious about this boy ? " " Who said anything about being serious ? Damn . Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal about this ? " " You 're apparently the one making a big fucking deal about it and apparently your neighbors are all asking questions . " " 1 low do you know what my neighbors are asking ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street from you whose daughter is in Chancel 's class
