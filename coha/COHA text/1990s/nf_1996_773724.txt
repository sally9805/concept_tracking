txt // has demonstrated how widely news was disseminated in the 1620S , and although it may have circulated less rapidly in the earlier part of James I 's reign there was a good deal of interest even then , as the number of surviving separates ' of important parliamentary speeches shows . " Libels ' ? manuscript verses commenting ( usually adversely ) on public figures ? were already freely passed around during Salisbury 's ascendency . At least a score had been dispersed on the Great Contract discussions , the Earl complained in 1610 , and some of them , he admitted , look for a Tiberius or Sejanus , though he does not seem to have been as alarmed by the allusion as Charles I and Buckingham were when Eliot used it in 1626.4 These preliminary excursions into parliamentary politics should not mislead the reader into thinking that I minimize the importance of the politics of the Court . On the contrary , we can not understand one without the other . The Court was where power resided , and Englishmen of all sorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour there . Newsletters and other correspondence show the eternal fascination of gossip about who 's up , who 's down , and with the tedious games of boot-licking and palm-greasing required of courtiers who wished to attract , or retain , a patron . Gerald Aylmer 's King 's Servants gave us a marvellously detailed picture of the court bureaucracy ; Linda Levy Peck has reminded us of how corrupt the game became in the early seventeenth century ? or at least how the stricter standards of probity now demanded made it seem so . ' It may help us to understand the perceptions of the Court held by its critics if we take one of its members as an example , and examine his activities in detail . I do not suggest that he was necessarily typical of the middle-level bureaucrat of his day , but enough features of his career conformed to a commonly held stereotype to make him worth pursuing up the ladder of advancement .

My sample courtier comes from Cawston in Norfolk . Sir Edmund Sawyer was a product of that familiar phenomenon , the rising yeoman class . His father was one of those parish notables ' familiar to us from Keith Wrightson 's work , who came to local prominence in the later years of Elizabeth 's reign , helping to run his village with paternalist efficiency , drawing up lists of the poor with meticulous care , and conscientiously organizing the distribution of grain during the dearth of // the 159os . He had connections with powerful county families : he may have done surveys for the Wyndhams at Felbrigg ; he certainly leased land from Sir Henry Hobart of Blickling , Attorney-General and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under James I.6 It was evidently the Hobart connection that launched young Edmund Sawyer in the bureaucracy . By 1607 he was described as ' gentleman ' ? as his father now also was ? and by then or soon afterwards he had begun a career in the Exchequer , in which he rose to become senior Auditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the market , both on his own account and as agent for others ; he has recently been described as perhaps the greatest of the early seventeenth-century agents and certainly the most successful financially ' . As we might expect from the son of a father who kept such obsessively careful records , Edmund had strong views on administrative efficiency , making numerous recommendations for the improvement of Exchequer procedures . ' In 1617 he married the daughter of a gentleman from Berkshire , one of the counties in which he was already dealing in crown property . As he would soon be bringing his bride to Cawston , he told his father , it was important to finish the rebuilding of the family 's house as handsome as conveniently you may ' . Edmund would send down a decent bed and bedding , and would buy anything else needed to give his wife and her grand relations the like entertainment I have had with them ' . The old house and its furnishings , good enough for a former Norfolk yeoman , were not smart enough for an upwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his back on his local origins completely . He was knighted in 1625 , and by the time his father died two years later Sir Edmund had bought the manor of Heywood in White Waltham , Berkshire , where he continued to live . In characteristically businesslike fashion he rigorously enforced manorial custom when it was in his interest to do so , extorting arbitrary entry fines and aggressively exploiting his own pasture rights , but showing much less interest in paternalist survivals like the lord 's traditional duty of paying for a dinner for the tenants . The tenants claimed to have suffered worse from him than from any previous landlord . Soon after his father 's death he sold the little Norfolk estate to Sir John Hobart . I am little acquainted with the country ' , Sir Francis Bacon once admitted . That was to be his undoing , as it was to be Sawyer's.9 In 1624 Sawyer was returned as MP for Windsor , and in 1628 he sat for Berwick-on-Tweed . While that Parliament was in session he was // appointed a Master of Requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exchequer : clearly he was a man on the way up . " But there were dangers for courtiers in the 162os , especially in a parliamenttime . Sawyer 's only recorded intervention in the Commons on a policy matter in 1628 occurred on r1 April , when he spoke in favour of more speedy collection of the subsidies . On 17 May , however , he was denounced as the back-stairs author of a proposed revision of the Book of Rates which would have increased the crown 's income from impositions by about ? 1oo,000 a year . Methinks the King may easily make it double ' , he is alleged to have said : all they had to do was to make one shilling two shillings throughout the whole book ' . " His defence that he did nothing here but by the King 's command ' simply got him into worse trouble . Everyone knew that the monarch could do no wrong , and it did not help when Charles confirmed that everything had indeed been done by his command . Sir Edmund 's most foolish move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by urging a customs farmer who was giving testimony not to reveal anything about their conversations . When this came out the Commons promptly expelled him , declared him ineligible for re-election , and put him in the Tower . ' No one spoke up for Sawyer when the motion was made to imprison him . He swore that he wished that he were hanged ' if he had been responsible for the impositions proposal , and this provoked cries of a good motion ! ' Sawyer was a conscientious administrative reformer , genuinely trying to make royal government more efficient and put it on a sounder financial footing . But he had few connections outside the Court , and he had refashioned himself as a Berkshire knight through office , not birth . I have ever hated . . . men that have raised their estates thus ; Sir Dudley Digges reflected ; men who advanced themselves by the ruin of the commonwealth ' . And the sins of one generation could easily be visited on another : fifty years later Sawyer 's lawyer son was sneered at as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " The same sort of antagonism was directed at newly sprung-up peers . When Dudley Carleton was made a lord in 1626 an MP complained that he had not a place to be made Lord of , and had been elevated simply to help make a party ' for Buckingham in the upper House.4 Sawyer was promptly released when Parliament was adjourned , and he had many more years of service to the crown ahead of him , both at the Exchequer and as the King 's man in Berkshire . Busy as ever on administrative reforms that would benefit the crown , in 1638 he was painstakingly inspecting household accounts from as far back as 1526 , looking // for book-keeping irregularities . " Historians are right to insist on the complexity of the Court/Country relationship : many people had a foot , physically or mentally , in both . But there were enough careerists like Sawyer who conformed to the stereotype of the courtier as the ambitious social climber , supporting arbitrary courses in order to advance himself , to give it plausibility . For most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote , dimly perceived abstraction . The politics that really mattered to them took place in their localities ? in discussions of assessments , the militia , the Forced Loan , the impressment or billeting of soldiers , or in oldfashioned power struggles for personal pre-eminence , sometimes fought out in parliamentary elections . In the past few years we have become increasingly aware of the reciprocal relationship between national and local politics . As we have been so often reminded , MPs were at the intersection of Court and Country , transmitting national policy to the localities , but also conveying local grievances to the government at Westminster . We sit here as dutiful subjects to the King , Sir George More reflected in 1626 , and as faithful servants to the commonwealth . " ' Enough has been written on this subject to make it unnecessary to pursue the subject in detail , but it is the essential background to the national politics which we shall consider in the rest of this chapter . Let us do , then , what we have so often been urged to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of ordinary , or almost ordinary , Englishmen . We might do worse than begin with a story set in the most ancient of all English cathedral cities . Soon after the opening of Parliament in 1628 troops arrived in Canterbury and had to be billeted . Well-meaning city officials bustled about : all propertied householders , they decided , should take one or two soldiers , according to their means , or pay four shillings a week for their maintenance . A Canterbury magistrate was in London soon afterwards and proudly reported his brethren 's actions to one of the city 's MPs , a gentleman named Thomas Scott . Here is Scott 's account of the conversation that followed : He asked me how I liked this . You have done , said I , like fools and knaves . Like fools and knaves ? said he . Yea , quoth I . . . why did you meddle with that with which you had nothing to do ? . . . The King , said he , commanded it . Abused , said I , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in such cases it is the subjects ' duty not to do against right and his Majesty 's and the people 's safety , but humbly to inform and petition his Majesty . 24 . Itching after popularitie ' As a Parliament-man Scott was exempt from billeting . But he had strong views on the subject . Billeting , said Scott , ' is against the liberty of a free Englishman and gentleman and of a parliament man , and intended by the Duke to do us a mischief . For to what other use can Irish popish soldiers . . . serve ? They , together with the reiters , popish and Arminian and Maynwarian faction , and the rogues whereof this city and the country is full , must help set up popery and the excise and , as some of them do already give out , cut the Puritans ' throats . Scott has often been dismissed as an unrepresentative firebrand , and even Peter Clark 's more favourable account of him shows that he was prone to fits of paranoia . " But in fact his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , even if , in Parliament at least , they were usually expressed more discreetly : people often said a lot more in private than they did in public . Scott was one of those middling-level gentry so thick on the ground in Kent , a grandson of no less a person than Sir Thomas Wyatt , leader of the 1554 rebellion against Mary Tudor 's Spanish marriage . " He sat in both the 1624 and 1628 Parliaments , but never seems to have opened his mouth . If we had only the parliamentary record to rely on , we might imagine that Scott was one of those allegedly apolitical country members whose silence indicates either parochialism or detachment from the affairs of the kingdom . The robust independence of his writings refutes this assumption . We may well wonder how many of the silent majority , sitting enthralled ( or intimidated ) by the selfconfident rhetoric of articulate leaders such as Coke and Eliot , shared his prejudices and enthusiasms . Many of Scott 's ideas were utterly familiar commonplaces ? the birthrights and privileges of freeborn Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due process of law . By the later 162os he , and many who thought like him , saw these ancient liberties being menaced by a sinister conspiracy in high places . At its heart was the Duke of Buckingham , plotting , they thought , to promote Arminianism as a cover for popery , and to use Irish troops and German mercenaries ( reiters ) to suppress Parliament and all who wished to defend the ancient laws . The Duke , they feared , would find plenty of support among the rogues ' ? the disorderly adherents of the traditional festive culture which godly magistrates of their type were trying to stamp out . The aim of the Dukists , Scott says in another place , is to settle the excise and mass ' on the kingdom . Popery and arbitrary government ' , those staples of English // political rhetoric for more than a century to come : the conjunction between them is already in place ! ' There is no reason to believe that the ideas of members of the House of Commons differed in any essential way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King James certainly did not think so . The quotation in the title of this chapter is from a speech he made in Star Chamber in 1616 , and it concerns Justices of the Peace . In every cause that concerns prerogative , the King complained , reforming JPs give a snatch against monarchy , through their puritanical itching after popularity . ' He also warned Parliament-men against their tendency to press to be popular ' .21 We should note that James was not using the words popular ' and ' popularity ' in the modern sense of being well liked , but in the sense of pertaining to a government based on popular sovereignty . Some of his councillors had similar worries . Since the beginning of the reign , Lord Chancellor Ellesmere reflected in 161o , the popular state ' had grown big and audacious , leading to many contemptuous speeches against the King 's regal prerogative and power ' . Naturally he did not see this development as part of a high road to some inevitable future conflict , but he did observe that it was commonly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellesmere exaggerated , of course ; he was only the first of a succession of Stuart councillors to equate any assertion of parliamentary independence with popularity ' But his fears are none the less indicative of a changing political atmosphere . " In and out of Parliament , early Stuart gentlemen repeatedly insisted that a popular government was not what they wanted . I take God to witness ' , said Samuel Lewknor in 1610 , that it was no affectation of popularity ' that moved him to speak on the subject of the people 's grievances. ; Their ideas about government were shaped by that cluster of familiar assumptions discussed in the last chapter ? the analogy between the state and the patriarchal family , or between the state and the human body . The consensual implications of metaphorical structures of this kind are obvious . Historians who have taken the linguistic turn , and even those who have not , can easily accept the notion that political beliefs are shaped by the vocabularies in which they are articulated . ' But there was another political language available in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about politics in way that was very different from that of the Stuart kings and their councillors . That alternative was the language of the Ancient Constitution ' : the idea that there had existed since Anglo-Saxon // times a body of peculiarly English rights and liberties , enshrined in the Common Law and in parliamentary statutes . The lawyers , naturally , were the most enthusiastic about it . No other state is like this , Sir Edward Coke boasted : ... We have a national appropriate law to this kingdom . If you tell me of other laws Roman law , for instance you are gone.J2 ' In fact it was usually Coke who was gone , off on one of his dense and ( to us ) indigestible lists of precedents , which no one could produce better than the former Lord Chief Justice . Coke 's legal expertise may seem intimidating , but there were others in these parliaments ? Selden , Littleton , Hakewill , for example ? who were almost his equals . None of them doubted that , as Sir Dudley Digges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason more ancient than books , consisting much in unwritten customs . . . so ancient that from the Saxon days ... they have continued in most parts the same ' . He then proceeded to trace their origins from the laws of Ethelbert . When Coke could not pluck precedents out of his head other members found them in the records in the Tower or in the library of Sir Robert Cotton . Here is an old manuscript , De Mod() Tenendi Parliamentum ' , Sir John Eliot mused after doing some research on the voting of subsidies : I can find no such precedents as these the ones being urged by the Privy Councillors in it . ' z6 Eliot could find no precedents for voting subsidies under royal and conciliar pressure , but he could find plenty for the subjects ' liberties . The most glorious feature of the ancient laws , he and his colleagues agreed , was that they protected liberty and property ? property from illegal exactions like the Forced Loan , and liberty from violations like the arbitrary imprisonment of the loan resisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the great row over impositions in 1610 . Nicholas Fuller had put the matter bluntly in that year : the King can not lay a charge upon the subject 's goods without his consent:27 It is necessary to spend so much time on these admittedly platitudinous ideas because of the recent tendency to dismiss them as rhetorical bombast , behind which the real ' business of politics ? the infighting of courtiers and great men ? was concealed . I should be the last to deny that there was plenty of courtly infighting , or that it affected those who were the clients or allies of noblemen like Buckingham and Pembroke . But those clients and dependants were never more than a small fraction of the members of the House of Commons , or of the political nation outside it , so the political culture of the majority , the gentry , should not be written off as irrelevant . Why should we accept one set of rhetorical // conventions ? the ones emphasizing subservience and deference ? rather than another ? the even more common set which emphasized independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seventeenth-century Englishmen did genuinely believe that they possessed rights that set them apart from people in other countries . The greatest happiness of the subject and honour of the King , Sir George More declared , was that he rules over free men , not bondmen. ' 2$ This kind of xenophobia is almost tediously familiar : we have all encountered the stock figure of the English yeoman who , as an MP put it in 1626 , would beat ten of the slaves of France ' . Sir Dudley Digges drew on a different experience of foreign parts for his version : In Muscovy one English mariner with a sword will beat five Muscovites that are like to eat him ? The King 's men could also sometimes make the continental comparison . But the most insistent on their Englishness were those who spoke the language of liberty . Eliot regularly proclaimed his true English heart ' and appealed to our ancient English virtue , that old Spartan valour ' .29 Spartan valour was obviously a masculine virtue . The gentry 's political vocabulary was full of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his extravagant court saw in both a decline from the ? paradoxically ? manly virtues of Queen Elizabeth 's days . Around 1610 the youthful Prince Henry and his circle of Protestant militants had adopted Arthurian imagery , perhaps as a covert criticism of James 's pacific outlook . A decade later concerns about the King 's alleged subservience to Spain were deepened by his attachment to the infamous ' Spanish match ' . Long after the marriage scheme had been abandoned , Eliot was still deploring his countrymen 's neglect of the martial powers ' .3 ? Gendered language was not confined to the Court 's critics . Even a royal servant like William Trumbull could speak approvingly of the Commons ' alternative policy ? military support for the protestant Frederick and Elizabeth of Bohemia ? as a vigorous and masculine ' one . In 1626 , after war had come , Sir Robert Harley ( still a courtier ) identified the effeminateness of this kingdom and riotous excess ' as the chief causes of the recent failure at Cadiz . Another of Buckingham 's allies , the Yorkshireman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So the Duke was not necessarily the target of these charges ; indeed , after his angry return from Spain in 1623 he had assiduously presented himself as the chief exponent of the masculine ' war policy . " These anxieties had originated years earlier , and we shall hear more // about them in the next chapter . The murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in 1614 , when the Earl of Somerset 's secretary had been poisoned in the Tower at the instigation of the Earl 's new wife , Frances Howard , and her confidante Mrs Turner , had provoked a spate of pamphlets denouncing the degeneracy of the Court ? revealed in sexual and other kinds of corruption , in the popularity of masculine styles of dress ( much favoured by Mrs Turner ) among women , and of effeminate , foreign styles among men . Our minds , the old soldier Barnaby Rich declared in 1617 , are effeminated , our martial exercises and disciplines of war are turned into womanish pleasures and delights ... we are fitter for a coach than a camp ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their soft effeminacy and wantonness ' . " Moralizings like this had been part of the staple fare of puritan reformers at least since the 158os . But they had special resonance in Stuart England when they were coupled with evocations of the glories ( often grossly misrepresented ) of Queen Elizabeth 's reign . Nostalgia for Elizabeth , David Cressy reminds us , was often a way of uttering coded criticisms of the Stuarts.33 Not always very discreetly coded : Where are those spirits that in woman 's reign Sacked Cadiz and into terror struck all Spain ? an anonymous versifier asked in 1624 . Where now is Essex , Norris , Raleigh , Drake ? ' , John Rhodes demanded after the Isle de Rhe fiasco three years later.i ' No great skill was needed to crack the code when Gloriana was invoked in the House of Commons . Elizabethan victories were the yardstick against which the failures of the 162os were judged , and , Eliot and his friends liked to argue , were the result of the mutual love between her and her subjects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed by a grave and wise counsel ; Sir Francis Seymour declared , and never rewarded any man but for desert ' ? it did not require much insight to know that his subtext was an unspoken comparison with Buckingham , no longer the hero he had appeared to be in 1624 . But Elizabeth had also prospered , Coke and Phelips both pointed out , because she cleaved to God ' ? to a Protestant God , of course . The Duke 's friends naturally did not relish these comparisons : Eliot says that the glories of that princess were like basilisks in their eyes ' .35 Smart policies , both at home and abroad , lacked the masculine , // protestant vigour demanded by men who warmed themselves with romanticized memories of ' 88 . Come , let us to the wars again , a popular ballad urged , soon after the outbreak of the Thirty Years War , appealing to the example of the Elizabethan heroes who had fought for God and his Gospel ' . The myth of the elect nation ' may have been less prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still plenty of people who believed that God had given England special responsibility to defend the godly cause against the Roman Antichrist . Paranoia about the Catholic menace remained as widespread as ever in the 162os. ; 6 There was a growing tendency at Court to label holders of such beliefs as puritans ' and thus by definition disloyal . Their defenders retaliated by accusing the Arminians , now basking in royal favour , of smearing dutiful and honest subjects ' , thus dividing King and Parliament , and of proposing to the King designs that stand not with public liberty ' .37 Worries about clerical influence had been visible long before the rise of the Arminians in the i62os . Have we not sermons made every day to rail upon the fundamental laws of the kingdom ? ' an MP asked in 1610 ? the best road to preferment , he feared , was to tread upon the neck of the common law ' . " Thomas Scott soon labelled his clerical enemies kinglings , opposed to all true liberty ' . In 1614 the Bishop of Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to debate impositions , and warned the Lords that they would hear only undutiful and seditious speeches ' from the Lower House . There was an immediate outcry in the Commons ; Neile was worthy to have his head set up at Tower Hill ' one member suggested . What made matters worse was that people like Neile had such easy access to the King . They would do ill offices in private that had done this so publicly , Sir Dudley Digges warned , while another member complained that things were snatched out of this House-and carried to the King to no good intent ' . Always suspicious of clerical absolutists , in 1625 the Commons objected to having one from Oxford foisted on them as their preacher.39 Soon after the accession of Charles I the winds were turned , to use Eliot 's phrase , against old-fashioned Calvinist protestantism and in favour of the new Arminian beliefs . But the Commons continued to complain about them . The committee which considered Richard Montagu 's factious and seditious ' opinions ? denounced his Appello Caesarem as a great encouragement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in 1629 , was that an Arminian is the spawn of a Papist ' .4 ? Arminians were held to be dividing church and kingdom by // creating a factious party , of which Buckingham was the patron , to support such oppressions ' as the Forced Loan : popery and arbitrary government again . ' Not so long ago the polarities of Court and Country provided a comfortable conceptual anchor for historians of early modern England . Nowadays most of us are more suspicious of binary models of politics and society . People from the upper echelons of the political nation inevitably had a foot in both camps ( if indeed they were camps ) , or were themselves inwardly divided , their outlook part Court , part Country . Parliamentary criticism of the Court , we have been told , often came not from country ' members , but was stirred up by one Court faction against another . Yet as Stuart Clark has shown , thinking in binary opposites was an almost universal habit of mind in the seventeenth century , and this makes the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes rather more persuasive . Country gentlemen did blame the Court 's extravagance and corruption for many of the kingdom 's ills . The cause of his Majesty 's wants , said Sir James Perrott , was imposed by himself through the great pensions he gives.J ? z And not only pensions . Corruption , we have been reminded , was not a straightforward moral issue . Yet its obvious prevalence at James 's Court seriously undermined the confidence of gentlemen outside the charmed circle within which the benefits of place and patronage so agreeably circulated . The elaborate masques put on at the marriage of the royal favourite , Robert Carr , to Frances Howard were a means to make the Chequer poor , a Northumberland gentleman complained : at last the poor subject shall pay for all ! Pompous vanities , Walter Yonge complained when he heard that Buckingham had spent ? 4,000 on a banquet for Charles I and his queen ten years later . " And the language of Court and Country was so thoroughly familiar , a veritable mode of discourse , a literary genre : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastorals contrasting the honesty and simplicity of the country with the viciousness and corruption of the Court . Some of the best of it , of course , was written by courtiers . It provided ammunition for invective ? in some quarters the epithet courtier ' was regarded as actionable. ' -4 Whatever their own motives may have been , parliamentary orators in the 16206 knew that they were appealing to people who had made the Court ? Country dichotomy the very core of their politics . Digges wanted Charles I to rely on the honest country knights and burgesses , not , by implication , their opposites . // Courtiers . . . and other like implements ' , Thomas Scott thought , ought to be barred from Parliament ; if they were not it would lead to slavery and ruin ' . An honest man , but a courtier ' , he says of one acquaintance : it was almost a contradiction in terms . Of all the 16zos Parliament-men , Sir John Eliot was perhaps the most wedded to this kind of thinking , and it provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one among many who used it.45 There was always the danger of eliding one polarity into another : Court and Country into King and people . Not that the gentry openly blamed the King for the misdeeds of his Court ? it was always his advisers who were at fault . Their whole system of political ideas made it essential for them to believe this . When Wentworth says , I speak truly for the interest of the King and people ' , or Phelips protests , If we were to choose a government , we would choose this monarchy of England above all governments in the world ' , we can be sure that they mean it . However , they were not always sure that their loyalty was reciprocated . Phelips thought he knew why : Let him be accursed ... that by any course seeks to divert the King from his people . We come with loyal hearts . His Majesty shall find that it is we that are his faithful counselors. ' 46 We , not they : them and us . Sides are being taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsletter reporting the dissolution of the 1625 Parliament speaks of the king and his party ' . People in the countryside could also see what was happening : the Dorchester diarist William Whiteway noted that the dissolution occurred with great dislike of both sides ' . Three years later Sir John Rous complained that out of fourteen members returned for Suffolk seats in 1628 , ten were courtiers ' .47 Language of this kind suggests that the divisions involved something more than a simple breakdown of communication between centre and localities , but that they had an ideological dimension.48 Some courtiers were thought to favour policies which threatened the very foundations of the Ancient Constitution . There had been the row over Cowell 's law dictionary , The Interpreter , in 1610 ? the Commons described its definitions as undermining the very power and authority of the parliament ' . Cowell 's defenders , it was reported , sought to extenuate his fault for the valuing of themselves with the King ' .49 When , in 1614 , James threatened dissolution if the Commons did not immediately vote supplies , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of this , but of all parliaments ' .5 ? Hyperbole , no doubt ; yet later parliaments continued to worry about their liberties . In 1626 Sir Nathaniel // Rich claimed that there had been more invasions of parliamentary liberties under James than in any previous reign . " People were looking uneasily ( or sometimes , enviously ) across the Channel and noting the decline of representative assemblies . The King of France , Carleton professed to believe , was at liberty to do what he list ' , and Sir Roger Owen agreed that by power of edict he never calleth parliaments ' . $z It was surely no coincidence that just at this time Edward Grimeston published his translation of Pierre Matthieu 's His-tory of Lewis the Eleventh . In contemporary political discourse Louis XI repeatedly appears as the archetype of tyranny.53 We are the last mon-archy in Christendom that retain our original right and constitutions ' , Phelips declared in 1625 , and four years later Eliot was still going on about a Court plot to bring a Spanish tyranny amongst us ' .54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz-words were new counsels ' : a term picked up from the Court to signify the authoritarian policies to which Charles I and his advisers claimed they were being driven by the Commons ' obstructiveness . On 20 April the King warned the House that if they did not vote supply within five days he must be driven to change his counsels , and this threat was several times repeated . On 12 May Carleton ominously mentioned other countries where monarchy is changed by new counsels , the turbulence of representative assemblies having forced kings to adopt another form of government ' . The implied threat ? to the very existence of future parliaments ? was passed over at the time because the House had more pressing business ( the arrest of Digges and Eliot ) to attend to , but when the matter came up again three weeks later there was a great uproar . One member wanted those who advocated new counsels ' to be declared traitors ; another said that we were born free , and must be free if the King will keep his kingdom ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tower . But there were no concessions on the main issue ; the Commons firmly condemned the collection of tonnage and pound-age without parliamentary consent , and blamed it on the new counsels ' . After dissolving Parliament to save Buckingham from impeachment , Charles did indeed resort to the new counsels , with results that Richard Cust has so admirably analysed : the Forced Loan was a qualified fiscal success , but a public-relations disaster . " Buckingham was blamed for the Loan . But the Loan was not the only source of the widespread hatred of the Duke , a hatred that historians have never entirely explained . It may help us , perhaps , to understand the outlook of people from both levels of the political nation ? elite and // popular ? if we explore that hatred a little further . " In order to do so we need to return to the theme of inversion . Between 1626 and 1628 Buckingham became the focus of all the searing fears and anxieties that so violently gripped his contemporaries . One of the most acute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which the favourite was thought to be particularly vulnerable because of his numerous female Catholic relatives . Women who stepped out of their properly submissive place , it was thought , threatened to turn the whole world upside down , to make it a prey to satanically inspired forces of disorder and inversion . Male dislike of rebellious women was nothing new , but a succes-sion of recent Court scandals had reinforced it and given it immediate political relevance . Salisbury 's sexual improprieties , combined with his physical deformities , were regarded by his enemies as unmistakeable signs of political and financial corruptions ' But the really serious decline in the Court 's reputation occurred only after the Earl 's death in 1612 . First came the unsavoury proceedings which enabled Frances Howard to annul her previous marriage to the Earl of Essex so that she could marry the royal favourite , Robert Carr . Then followed the revelations about the subsequent poisoning of Carr 's secretary , Sir Thomas Overbury , which the Countess and her friend Mrs Turner were found to have plotted . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alleged , practised sorcery and enchantment ' , and used malign charms to make Essex impotent . A succession of sorcerers , including the well-known Simon Forman , had been consulted , and the Countess was also said to have asked a wise woman ' about ways of killing the unfortunate Earl . Mrs Turner was executed for the Overbury murder , but the Coun-tess , along with her new husband , now created Earl of Somerset , was pardoned by the King . The Howards , hitherto the dominant faction at Court , suffered further damage when the Earl of Suffolk , Frances 's father , was found guilty of large-scale corruption , for which his wife ( also thought to be an enchantress ' ) was largely blamed . " The Howards were not the only court family to be involved in such scandals . Lady Roos , daughter of the Secretary of State , Sir Thomas Lake , charged her husband with incest with the Countess of Exeter , his grandfather 's young wife , and was in turn accused of incest with her own brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into an unseemly public brawl over Coke 's ( eventually successful ) attept to marry off their daughter to Buckingham 's brother , Lord Purbeck . We // shall see in the next chapter how these episodes were processed in the popular mind ; even to the gentry they seemed to exemplify the malevolent power of women , exercised through sexual intrigue and the use of poisoning , sorcery , and witchcraft . Such assumptions had an obvious scriptural foundation . Giving judgement in the Exeters ' slander suit against the Lakes , James compared Secretary Lake to Adam , his wife to Eve , and their daughter , Lady Roos , to the serpent . But they also had more immediate political implications . By now , John Chamberlain reported , the King was in a great vein of taking down high-handed women , and after Lake 's dismissal ordered his Secretaries not to impart matters of state to their wives ' . " The fears of independent women , and more specifically of witches , seem to have reached a peak in the decade of the 162os . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Rhodes described the Spanish ambassador Gondomar , with his allegedly malign influence over James I , as that witch , whose charms enchanted us ' . The language may have been metaphorical , but when similar charges were made against Buckingham they were meant to be taken literally . The Duke was repeatedly accused of access to the black arts of magic and poisoning , both through his mother , the Countess , and his servant , Dr John Lambe , the sorcerer who was to be lynched on a London street in 1628 , shortly before Buckingham himself was assassinated . Buckingham 's sister-in-law , Lady Purbeck , was alleged to have used powders and potions ' against her husband and possibly against Buckingham himself ; it was rumoured that she had a wax effigy of the Duke , who was sufficiently worried to consult Bishop William Laud about it . Lambe was one of Lady Purbeck 's favourite sorcerers until Buckingham lured him into his own employment . The Duke was also accused of having an enemies list ' which included noblemen who had offended him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it died in allegedly mysterious circumstances . Some thought that the Duke 's purpose was to remove opponents of his pro-Catholic policies : was there anyone left unslaughtered or unpoisoned , Rhodes asked rhetorically in 1628 , to resist the headlong rush to Spanish thraldom ' ? 6o The most sensational charge , which figured prominently in the 1626 impeachment proceedings , was that Buckingham had hastened the death of James I by administering a plaster and a treacle posset made by the Duke 's mother . Buckingham himself gave James the drink , and the plaster was applied on his orders by a Catholic doctor who was not one of the King 's appointed physicians . Suspicions about the role of // Buckingham and his mother were not , it should be noted , simply concocted after the event by the Duke 's enemies in Parliament ; both the Earl of Kellie , writing from Court a few days before James died , and the Venetian ambassador , on the day of his death , had already taken note of them . ' The Countess 's access to evil black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic recusant ( so , at different times , were Buckingham 's wife , brother , and sister ) , and thus automatically suspected by Protestant Englishmen of being an agent of the Roman Antichrist . Thomas Crosfield , an Oxford don of moderate opinions , expressed the common belief : Fisher , the Jesuit who had converted her , ruled the Countess , and she the Duke , he the King ' . Purbeck , Buckingham 's brother , made no secret of his opinions . Smashing a window at Wallingford House in 1622 , he waved his bloody fist at people passing in the street and shouted he was a Catholic and would spend his blood in the cause ' .62 Buckingham 's supposed association with the forces of evil did not end there . Dr George Eglisham , the royal physician who first went public with the poisoning charge , also accused him of using ' enchantments ' and of frequent consultations with the ringleaders of witches ' ? people like Lambe , in other words . On 12 June 1626 , the day that the King and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings by dissolving Parliament , there was a great thunderstorm in London , apparently accompanied by a tornado ? a tempest whirling and ghoulish ' ? which opened the graves of some of the victims of the previous year 's plague epidemic . The day was long remembered as the terrible Monday ' : some thought Dr Lambe had caused it , and a gentleman was reported to have said that one of the Duke 's devils did arise ' in it.63 To our rational modern ears these stories sound absurd and historians have generally ignored them . But in the seventeenth century even educated people subscribed to a system of beliefs which required constant supernatural interventions in human affairs , and took them perfectly seriously . It was not thought at all ridiculous , for example , for a country vicar to be charged in the Court of High Commission with being a professor of the Art Magic ' , his speciality , apparently , having been the charming of pigs ' .64 Witchcraft , recusancy , the murder of the previous sovereign : these crimes of Buckingham and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The initial parliamentary attack on him , in 1625 , had been provoked by naval mismanagement , though there were also complaints about his multiplicity of offices ' and consequent // monopoly of patronage . " Proceedings against the Duke completely dominated the 1626 Parliament , and charges of increasing gravity were introduced : his incompetent conduct of war and diplomacy ; the vast accumulation of gifts and lands by his family ; his corrupt sale of titles and offices ; his encouragement of Catholics ! ' But the poisoning accusation was surely the most astonishing : no higher charge could have been brought against a royal minister than that of complicity in the murder of the previous King . Recent efforts to portray Buckingham as the victim of a Court conspiracy are not inaccurate in themselves . Dr Turner and some of the other leaders of the original parliamentary attack were indeed Pembroke 's men ; the Duke 's own client , Conway , dismissed the accusations as coming from that wretch Turner . . . that slave ' .6 ' But Turner 's connection with Pembroke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obscure the almost paranoid hatred of the Duke that was shared by a large segment of the political nation ' . The Duke was saved by the dissolution , but the pursuit was resumed in 1628 as soon as the King had given his assent to the Petition of Right . You all wish the Duke of Buckingham 's fall ' , Thomas Scott had assured his Canterbury neighbours earlier in the year ; the Duke , whom ... all the realm suspects to have poisoned King James ' .6 ' Almost equally violent language was soon being heard at Westminster . On 5 June , after the King had ordered the Commons not to cast any further aspersions on the government , Coke defiantly named Buckingham as the cause of all our miseries ' . There was a chorus of approval : the Duke would make us all slaves ' ; his friends were papists and atheists ' ; he was sending soldiers to cut our throats ' . Such language once again brings Thomas Scott closer to the mainstream than he is usually thought to be . Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom ' ? ' of all Christendom ' , Richard Knightley proposed to add . The question was just being put that the Duke was an enemy to the state ' when the Speaker arrived with the King 's order to adjourn.b9 The gentry 's fear and hatred of Buckingham was made plain both in and outside the House of Commons . Once again Pierre Matthieu was enlisted : two separate translations of his life of the favourite Sejanus were published in 1628 . And in at least one anonymous libel the Duke was explicitly identified with the tyrant Louis XI , whose biography , it will be recalled , Matthieu had also written . There had been nothing like this since Wolsey 's time , and now , thanks in part to the wide circulation of manuscript libels and ballads , there was a much better-informed // political nation than there had been in the sixteenth century . ' ? Earlier royal ministers , as Pauline Croft has recently shown , had also been the targets of libels , but even those attacking Salisbury had lacked the virulence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had occurred only after the Earl 's death . " Buckingham had enjoyed a brief period of popularity after the breakdown of the Spanish Match , but this was only a minor interruption to the flood of bitter denunciations levelled against him in parliamentary debates , pamphlets , and above all in the libellous verses so popular in early Stuart England . Their wide circulation is attested by the frequency with which they crop up in the diaries and commonplace books of the period . ' The Duke 's upstart origins , his ravenous appetite for gain for himself and his kinsfolk , his sexual habits , military incompetence , connections with papists and Arminians , and his supposed Spanish sympathies , were all remorselessly attacked . Spanish gold , alas , finds rare denial ' , John Rhodes reflected , but Buckingham was also pro-French , paradoxically , embarking on wars with both continental superpowers only in order to destroy his own ( Protestant ) country . At the Isle de Rhe , disloyalty , not fortune , lost the day ' , Rhodes thought , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the favourite deserved punishment:7 ' ... poniards , poisons , swords , With plaisters , potions , witchcraft , coining Lords , Corrupting , selling justice ; wasting treasure In oyster-voyages and seats of pleasure . Most of the libels are from Charles I 's reign , but a few date from the early 162os and contain what were soon to be familiar charges . One introduces the Sejanus analogy , and notes the Duke 's corrupt sales of offices , while another associates this practice with the whole Villiers family . Hark how the wagons crack 1 With their rich lading ' , the anonymous author says , going on to ask : Will you an office get ? Then you must come buy it . ' The same libel includes some leering verses on the family 's sexual promiscuity , reporting an alleged affair of Buckingham 's mother with the Lord Keeper , Bishop Williams , and the use of the Villiers women to connect the Duke with the old nobility ? They get the devil and all , I That swive the kindred . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps surprisingly ) not against Buckingham himself . But other libels noted how the Duke influenced people by his Ganymedian looks ' , and coded references to // Buckingham 's relationship with James were common . Thomas Scott had certainly heard them and may even have thought that the Duke was also Charles 's lover ; in one place he describes him as Charles 's Gaveston ' .74 The Court , to be sure , was the source of many of the libels , but courtiers well knew what the country 's attitude to Buckingham was . One asks Why did this knight , and that rich squire , Who did their kingdom 's good desire , The voices of their shires to gain , Free open houses now proclaim ? The answer was clear : they were celebrating because they thought Buckingham was leaving the country and so there would soon be a parliament . Alas , the poem continues , The Duke 's returned , these hopes are vain ' .75 Buckingham had his defenders , of course , but the libels put out by Court scribblers appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We find the scandalous verses in the commonplace books of a Dorchester merchant and a Cambridge wit , for example , and in the diary of a Suffolk minister . ' A mock epitaph composed after the Duke 's assassination was a particular favourite : I that my country did betray , Undid that King that let me sway His sceptre as I pleased ; brought down The glory of the English crown ; The courtiers ' bane , the country 's hate , An agent for the Spanish state ; The Romists ' friend , the gospel 's foe , The church and kingdom 's overthrow .. . The gentry could not openly acclaim the Duke 's murder ? as the next chapter will show , it was a different matter for the common people ? but many did so in private . Felton , the assassin , gave two different accounts of his motives : one , that he had been passed over for promotion and was owed ? 8o in arrears of pay ; the other , that he had been moved to murder Buckingham by reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke was named as the principal cause ' of the evils besetting the kingdom . Felton said that this convinced him that by killing the favourite he should do his country great service ' . Perhaps he had also heard reports of speeches like Edward Kirton 's on 5 June : The Duke is an enemy to the kingdom , and so to the King ; and I hope every // good subject will before long draw his sword against the enemies of the King and kingdom ? Did the firebrand Scott ever say anything more inflammatory ? It is a measure of how far things had gone that the House quickly excused words that so closely bordered on an invitation to assassination or even rebellion , resolving that Kirton did not exceed the bounds of duty and allegiance ' . " Thomas Scott had long since wanted Buckingham brought to account for poisoning King James , and those other treasons and murders whereof he is accused ' . So he naturally commended Felton and saw Buckingham 's death as a providential deliverance ; it was followed by a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . ' $ A few libels deploring the assassination appeared , but to judge from the popularity of the ones that applauded Felton as a hero , Scott 's views were widely shared . The Duke is dead , and we are rid of strife ' , one versifier began hopefully , going on to argue that Felton 's act was justified because Buckingham had avoided a lawful trial by parliamentary impeachment . Numerous mock epitaphs listed the Duke 's vices and commended the assassin . Live ever , Felton , one ended , thou hast turned to dust , I Treason , ambition , murder , pride and lust . ' King and kingdom had been set at liberty ' by the murder , one libel suggested , while another thought that it was now possible to reunite Charles and his subjects , previously divided by the Duke 's evil counsel.79 The parliamentary gentry attacked Buckingham so violently because their assumptions made it unthinkable for them to attack the King . The doctrine of the evil councillors ' became their principal justification for doing in practice what they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his government . Buckingham was repeatedly charged with having used misinformation ' to maintain his control over a supposedly helpless monarch . The King could do no wrong : if wrong was done by the King 's command , it could only be because he had been misinformed before he gave that command . As Eliot put it in 1626 , no act of the King can make him unworthy of his kingdom ' ; such an idea would be against the tenet of our religion ' . ' The argument was brilliantly designed to ensure that whatever actions the Commons took , even ones that the King thought hostile , were in fact expressions of the deepest loyalty . If anything fall out unhappily ' , Phelips complacently reflected , it is not King Charles that advised himself , but King Charles misadvised by others and misled by misordered counsel ' : by the likes of the Duke or Sir Edmund Sawyer , in other words ! ' // So a good many of the gentry , both in and outside of Parliament , shared Thomas Scott 's conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingdom ' . Even Magna Carta , Thomas Hedley announced in 161o , was simply a restoring and confirming ' of older liberties. $z The Charter was regularly invoked , but it could no longer be taken for granted . Is it now held inconvenient to speak for confirmation of that Charter which our ancestors got with much sweat and blood ? ' , Sir Thomas Beaumont demanded in 161o.8 ; Even less could it be taken for granted in 1628 after the Forced Loan and the imprisonment of the loan resisters . Until of late , William Coryton asked rhetorically , who dared violate Magna Carta ? ' Hence the need to restate those threatened liberties in the Petition of Right . What we have done , Sir Walter Erie declared , is only for the liberty of the subject , and it is no new thing . ' They had been sent to Westminster by their countries , another member reflected in language that Thomas Scott could have used , to save them and ourselves from being slaves ' . $ ? But although it was unthinkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by increasing violence of language , and the Commons seem to have been increasingly willing to excuse it . When More suggested the possibility of tyranny in 1626 the House sent him to the Tower with Elizabethan promptness . " 5 But when in 1628 Kirton seemed to threaten rebellion if Buckingham was not removed , they quickly decided that he meant nothing disloyal . We must either lay the fault upon the King or the Duke , Coke reflected , and as the former was impossible , everything had to be piled on the Duke 's shoulders.86 Defending himself in 1625 from critics of the French marriage , Charles deplored the speeches of malicious men ' who had hinted that he was not so true a keeper and maintainer of the true religion that I profess ' . $ ' Some of these malicious men ' remembered Charles 's elder brother and felt that things would have been very different if he had lived to succeed James . Thomas Scott was one of them : in 1628 he was still commemorating the day of noble Prince Henry his nativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taboo . The only recorded instance of it in the Commons in 1628 occurred in a debate on the charges against Buckingham on 5 June , when Hugh Pyne said , I think we can hardly tax the man in question without blaming a greater power ' . Pyne was a notorious radical who had been in serious trouble a few years earlier for saying that Charles was as unfit to rule as his shepherd , and it is astonishing that no action was taken against him . It may be that hardly anybody heard him ? during his speech the members ' attention would have been Itching after popularitie ' 4.1 fixed on the Speaker , who was just entering the House with the message adjourning them until the next day.89 Scott may have been unusual in the intensity of his political passions , but there is plenty of evidence that they were shared , sometimes in less virulent form , by others of his class . Many people , of course , dutifully intoned the ideal of harmony . The Commons , Sir Edwin Sandys piously claimed in 161o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state ' .9 ? Courtiers were even more likely to invoke the consensus ideal , as Carleton did in 1626 when he regretted that we talk in this House in sides ' .9 Few , probably , would have agreed with Eliot when he praised variety of opinions , or argued that by debate and reasoning pro and con truth comes to light ' .9 Yet noisy and disputatious practice all too often disrupted the prescribed harmony . Things had been particularly bad in 1614 : there were murmurings ' during speeches , a member was hissed at ' when he wanted to cave in to James over impositions , and the chairman of a committee was threatened with assault . Sir Herbert Croft likened the House to a cockpit.93 There may have been slightly more decorum in the 16zos ? except in 1629 , of course ? but this was not because MPs were afraid of divisions . There was a striking incident in 1626 when the Commons divided over a motion to ask the Lords to imprison the Duke pending the hearing of the charges of treason against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accept it , desiring to be numbered ? A vote of 225 to 106 violated the conventions of consensus and unanimity , but it also sent a stronger message than a confused medley of voices.94 The dramatic scenes that preceded the 1629 dissolution , when the Speaker was restrained from leaving the chair while Eliot 's three inflammatory resolutions were carried by acclamation , should now be easier to understand . A lot of people shared Thomas Scott 's conviction that there really was a threat to English liberties , and to the Elizabethan Protestantism on which they had been raised . It may seem difficult to grasp why , after all this , Charles I 's personal rule should have aroused so little open opposition . One currently popular explanation is that the country gentry were less restive than the verbal posturings of their parliamentary spokesmen would suggest , and that the personal rule represented the normal functioning of seventeenth-century government in peacetime . Charles was in many ways a reforming king , and after 1629 even former critics of the Court like Sir Robert Phelips actively enforced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has argued , the gentry 's reactions // to the administrative reforms ranged from grudging to enthusiastic ' . Sharpe regards Ship Money as the great success story ' of the decade , and concludes that the absence of vocal protest remains remarkable ' .95 It is certainly true that there were few public protests by the gentry against the personal rule . We should not expect very many in the absence of a parliament , the only acceptable forum in which national grievances could be voiced . Country gentlemen like Phelips had always believed that it was their duty to carry on the King 's government in their shires , whatever happened in Parliament . As we have seen , even during a parliament-time people had to be careful what they said , and were inclined to burn their correspondence.96 Seventeenth-century Englishmen were brought up to believe that obedience to lawful authority was ordained by their religion ; and monarchy , after all , still reflected their patriarchal assumptions . The end of the wars with France and Spain in 1630 removed the financial and military pressures that lay behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration to New England siphoned off some of the most active opponents of the crown 's religious policies . And finally , Buckingham was gone : until 164o there was no obvious scapegoat on whom everything could be blamed . All this is undeniable , and it is undoubtedly true that most of the conflicts that are visible in the 163os had more to do with religion than with secular issues . The religious conflict ranged on one side those who were resisting Laudian liturgical innovations and the ungodly Book of Sports , and on the other , those who wished to define all critics of Laudian policies as seditious puritans ' . In 1634 and 1635 , John Rous noted , there were many verse libels in circulation attacking both the orthodox ' ( that is to say , the Calvinists ) , and the new churchmen , or Laudians.97 But there is much evidence of continuing hostility to Laudian ceremonies , and of growing suspicions of Catholic infiltration in both Church and government . No doubt those firmly attached to such beliefs were a minority , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as puritans ' if we accept the Laudian redefinition of the term to include virtually everyone who disagreed with the Archbishop 's policies . As Esther Cope 's study of the personal rule reminds us , it is a mistake to separate religion and politics at any time in the seventeenth century , particularly in a decade like the 163os when increasing numbers of people were coming to believe in the existence of a sinister popish plot ' against English liberty and independence.98 Even in the absence of Parliament there was widespread concern about the direction of affairs . Victor Morgan has shown that there were Itching after popularitie ' 4-3 worries about the claims to a virtually uncontrolled royal prerogative even in the universities , not normally places to look for courageous criticism of VVhitehall.99 It is true that , as Sharpe , John Morrill , and others have shown , there was very little open opposition to Ship Money on grounds of principle before Hampden 's case in 1637 . But the proliferation of rating and other procedural disputes has been widely noted , and many historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic for sensible people to adopt when they had increasingly serious private doubts about the legality of the rate as levied . It is interesting that even at the time of the early writs , diarists tended to record instances of opposition to the tax rather than the allegedly more general acquiescence . ? ? Hampden 's case may not have been typical , but the trial aroused enormous public interest ? Sir Thomas Knyvett could not get in even though he had been queuing since early morning ? and there was a huge demand for copies of the judges ' opinions . Similar ' multitudes ' had attended the Star Chamber trials of Prynne , Burton , and Bastwick a few months earlier , and there had been the same demand for news about them . ' ? ' So the current of religious discontent was easily reconnected to politics when the personal rule ran into serious trouble in 1637 . I find it hard to believe that many people had ever disconnected them . The example of Sir Robert Harley ? until 1635 Master of the Mint , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how inextricably interwoven the divine and the secular spheres still were . In 1633 Harley 's notes for family prayers included petitions for an happy meeting in parliament ' ; for the continental Protestants whom England had abandoned ( he prayed especially for a worthy general to succeed the King of Sweden ' ) ; for the suppression of popery and Arminianism ; for those gone out of the land ' to New England ; and for other highly political causes . " But the gentry of the political nation still believed in monarchy , and some of them were undoubtedly disturbed by what they saw as the turbulent , perhaps even seditious , behaviour of some MPs in 1628 and 1629 , and by the evidence of even more widespread discontent outside Parliament . Thomas Hobbes was sufficiently alarmed by the tide of opinion to produce a new translation of Thucydides in order to warn against the dangers of popular government , and against those who swayed the assemblies , and were esteemed wise and good commonwealth 's men ' because they advanced the most dangerous and desperate enterprises ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many of // his neighbours in Kent thought Parliament much to blame ' for what had happened before the dissolution . Another Kentish gentlemen was so shocked by it all that he felt impelled to refute the dangerous heresies of those who were still itching after popularity ' . He was related to Thomas Scott by marriage , had certainly met him , and in the cosy social world of the Kent gentry he must have heard enough from Scott and from others like him to cause him to fear that the very foundations of his world were threatened . By 1632 Sir Robert Filmer had written his famous Patriarcha , with its subtitle : The Natural Power of Kings Defended against the Unnatural Liberty of the People . Only recently has it been discovered that this classic monarchical tract was written , not in reaction to the collapse of kingly power in the civil war , but in a panic fear of popular government after the events of the 162os. ' ? 4 It is time to look more closely at the unnatural liberty of the people ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckingham , almost universal among the English gentry outside Court circles in the 1620s , was shared with equal fervour by many of their inferiors . So also were several other elements that we have found in the politics of the elite : the respect for ancient custom , the anxieties about social and gender instability , the intense suspicion of Catholics and fears of popish conspiracy . This was a shared political culture , but as we shall see , some features of it were even more deeply ingrained in the outlook of the common people than in that of the gentry : the use of metaphors of inversion , for instance . But before we turn to the particular features of the commoners ' response to public matters before 164o , we ought to pay some attention to the more general context of popular politics . Earlier in this book I expressed some reservations about making too sharp a distinction between elite and popular culture . But we should not throw the baby out with the bath-water . Some cultural forms obviously did belong to the elite , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed culture . If he chose to , the university-educated minister could read anything from a Latin treatise to a street ballad ; the illiterate labourer had access only to the ballad , and then only if it was read aloud by somebody else . Even when they required no particular level of education , some activities were appropriate for the rich , others for the poor . It is not fit that clowns should have these sports , said James I in 161o , calling for stricter game laws . When Robert Dover organized his Olympick Games ' on the Cotswolds a few years later he was trying to rebuild a unified community , but he was careful to provide different sports for different classes : fencing and horse-racing for the quality , shin-kicking and wrestling for the plebs . ' The gentry did not need Robert Dover to remind them of their cultural superiority . It was part of the air they breathed , and it determined their attitudes to many other matters besides rural sports . The law , for example : in 1626 an MP moved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of quality and not by the ordinary jurors // of small value or judgment ' . A given level of wealth and education was appropriate to any status or occupation . It was thought particularly reprehensible when a Welsh bishop gave livings to unable and unworthy men ' ? decayed tradesmen , a footman and groom , a sexton , an officer of the ecclesiastical court . Complaints about a parson 's disorderly living in the 163os included the charge that he kept company with beggars , tinkers , bedlam men , and all sorts of people ' ? Some were more fit to govern than others , and even the aristocracy 's fiercest critics knew this . Thomas Scott might wish to see wider political participation by the honest Canterbury tradespeople , but he also believed that drovers , brewers , tiplers , and base mechanics ' ought not to hold civic office . He wanted a puritan parity ' in the church , by which he meant a drastic reduction in the authority of bishops , but he indignantly denied wanting an Anabaptistical parity ' , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . ' Sir Edward Coke was equally insistent on the sanctity of hierarchical relationships . Much of the disorder in James I 's household , he thought , was caused by ministers who from a shop leapt presently to the Green Cloth ' : he meant the former Lord Treasurer , Sir Lionel Cranfield , of course.4 Then as now , people blamed the educational system for whatever was amiss . The Earl of Northampton thought nothing so hurtful to the commonwealth as the multitude of free schools , which gave young men ideas above their stations . They neither will be soldiers , nor prentices , the Earl complained , but either run over sea or go up and down breeding new opinions ' .5 Social differences were naturally translated into differences of culture . Visible markers like dress helped to define the individual 's status . As a Parliament-man , the clothier John Noyes had to attend the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 161o . He was amazed by all the cloth of gold , the expensive lace and embroidery sported by his richer colleagues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of a great many of golden feathered doves ' . b That was the point : he was meant to . These differences inevitably included differences in political culture . This does not mean that there was an absolute social divide , or that the common people ? and in particular the smaller propertied householders ? had nothing to do with high politics . But there were some important differences of emphasis between the politics of the two levels of the political nation . When the lower orders thought about politics they thought about taxation , billeting , and impressment ; but they also thought about more // local matters . Contests for place and patronage could be fought just as fiercely around the parish pump as in the royal Court . To the participants , the stakes in a struggle over access to town lands at Malmesbury , a new charter at Leeds , the town clerk 's place at Blandford , or the rights of the freemen at Dorchester might seem just as high , and might generate just as much passion , as one at Whitehall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Issues of this kind were of concern primarily to urban householders . But some aspects of popular politics were of concern to virtually everyone . People of all classes , in country as well as town , treasured their customary rights of access to basic resources like land and food , and were likely to take action when those rights were threatened . Much has been written about food riots in early modern England , and we need only recall a few salient points about them . ' In the typical riot of the kind described by numerous modern historians rioters would seize the grain , appealing to the now frequently ignored legislative prohibitions against such shipments in times of dearth . Their targets were usually not the local producers or landowners , but the middlemen thought to be responsible for the shortage . Take heed how they do oppress 1 The poor that God obey ' , a ballad urged corn-hoarders during the bad years of the early 163os : God will not let these long alone that do him wrong ? ' Elizabethan and early Stuart grain riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort who were by now adopting the values of the market economy , and their poorer neighbours , who still remained attached to the ideals of custom and good neighbourhood : the values of the moral economy ' . ' ? Much the same pattern is visible in the typical anti-enclosure riot . When tenants were at odds with their landlords over illegal enclosures or violations of rights of common , the first step was a lawsuit , paid for out of a common fund . If this failed there might be threats against the landlord or his agents , minor or symbolic violence against property ? the killing of sheep , the burning of ricks or barns . Finally , if the sense of injustice was still strong enough , full-scale riot might erupt , with the destruction of fences and the occupation of the land allegedly taken unjustly by the landlord . " At Frampton-on-Severn in ilizo Lord Berkeley tried to enclose land near the river on which the inhabitants claimed rights of common . About uoo people collected , Berkeley 's steward records , whereof some threatened death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditches , others chased the justices ' horses up and down the grounds ' . Twenty years later John Williams , leader of the q 8 Custom and Inversion skimmington ' rioters in the Forest of Dean , threatened violence , even against the King 's officers , if they entrenched upon his liberties ' .12 En-closure rioters , like grain rioters , were protecting a traditional way of life threatened by innovation , and this was just as much the case in the riots against drainage , disafforestation , and mining projects as it was in enclosure riots in the more traditional arable regions . When their lands were being ruined during the coal boom of the early 1600s , the Tyneside copyholders used both legal and direct action against the coal-owners , appealing , David Levine and Keith Wrightson have written , to custom , consent , reasonable dealing , and hostility to the exercise of an arbitrary absolute power ' . This is not so very different from the expectations of the gentry when they thought about the affairs of the commonwealth . " These grass-roots conflicts ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ecological systems . The protesters saw themselves as the defenders of ancient rights and customs guaranteeing mutual subsistence . But to the drainers and enclosers they were simply obstructionist nuisances : ignorant and froward men who had rather live a poor and lazy life than a rich and industrious one , as Charles I 's Council said of opponents of Lincolnshire drainage schemes . ' 4 Their appeals to ancient custom were treated with arrogant contempt . In 1609 the crown 's agents in Kingswood Forest dismissed such stratagems as those of a company of silly country partially affected inhabitants . . . who can not speak of above sixty or seventy years , a weak proof ' . " When it suited them a few eminent defenders of the Ancient Constitution might try to protect the customary rights of their poorer neighbours : Oliver Cromwell as Lord of the Fens ' in the 163os , Sir John Wray in Lincoln-shire , and Sir Robert Phelips in Somerset are well-known examples . But only when it suited them . Casting around for a way to settle the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Coke recommended the enclosing of waste grounds . . . the King having thirty-one forests , besides parks , that he could thus exploit . Sir Dudley Digges put forward similar proposals . That the forest-dwellers would lose their common rights did not seem to bother them.i6 So in these matters both the King and his critics were among the innovators , though it was the King who sponsored the biggest projects that threatened the traditional way of life of the forest- and fen-dwellers . Not surprisingly , there were outbursts of seditious talk , especially at times of high food prices and depression . Memories of Kett 's rebellion ? the camping time ' ? still lingered at the end of Elizabeth 's reign in Norfolk and other eastern counties . The gentry of the clothing districts // also worried about the likelihood of disorder . There were 30,000 men within ten miles of his house in Yorkshire , Sir John Savile told the Commons in 1626 , who , if they have not relief shortly , will take it where they can get it ' . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgic invocations of a vanished past , and appeals to the universal myth of the absent , just king . In 1607 the Warwickshire rebels told the JPs that they had acted out of no undutiful mind to his Majesty ' , and asked them to intercede with him for redress of their grievances . This was a useful protective device , a strategem comparable to that of the parliamentary gentry when they declared that the King could do no wrong and that everything must therefore be blamed on his councillors . ' But it was more than a protective strategy when commoners appealed to immemorial right , to an ancient custom , written or unwritten , that to them was as sacred as any charter or parliamentary statute . A famous example is the Mowbray Deed at Haxey in the Isle of Axholme , which guaranteed the commoners their rights of pasture in perpetuity . Kept in a box in the church , beneath a stained-glass window depicting the original grant by Lord Mowbray , it had the same iconic character as Magna Carta had for the lawyers and gentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be reminded of it if we are to stop putting elite and popular politics into different compartments . When the gentry had grievances they could have them expressed in Parliament by identifiable spokesmen . When the commoners protested they had to find their own leaders , and invent names for them : Captain Cobbler , Captain Poverty , and Captain Pouch in earlier rebellions , for example . The Gillingham Forest rioters in 1628 simply borrowed military ranks : the colonel , the captain , and so on . ' ? In Braydon and Dean Forests the leader ? or leaders : it was a triumvirate in Braydon ? called themselves Lady Skimmington , or Captain Skimmington ' . In Essex in the 158os there had been no mythic leader , but there had been millenarian expectations of one : the return of one that was dead , after whose appearance sorrow and care shall be almost past ' . Some of these leaders may have emerged less spontaneously than the rioters pretended . On one occasion in the same county some discontented weavers planned to get a mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bocking town 's end , and so to Braintree and Coggeshall . . . and to cry " They are up ! They are up ! " , and then people to get to the churches and ring " Awake ! " " ' With or without mythic leaders , popular resistance was often carefully co Custom and Inversion organized , especially if members of the elite gave a legitimizing nod or wink . When Lord Poulett was obstructing the enclosure of Neroche Forest in Somerset , he got his ranger to tell people that if the King 's commissioners did not satisfy their complaints they should appeal to the courts or to Parliament . The ranger called a protest meeting and had it announced in the neighbouring churches on Sunday after morning prayer . All such as would stand against the disafforesting ' were urged to attend , and on the appointed day a crowd of some two or three hundred assembled . They agreed to put their purses together ' to prevent the enclosures , and send emissaries to London to start legal action . The methods used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? were not very different from the ones used by potential candidates in the preliminary manoeuvrings that sometimes preceded parliamentary elections . In Cornwall in 1628 Sir John Eliot and William Coryton sent circulars to the parishes , which were read after service on Sunday , urging freeholders to be present at the poll and by implication to vote for them . In both cases the strategy assumes the existence of an already politicized public . ' ' Historians are now beginning to accept that a considerable section of the public below the level of the elite had by this time become politically conscious . This was certainly clear in 1623 , when people of all classes joined in the wild celebrations that greeted the Prince 's return from Madrid after the failure of the Spanish Match . The two most vividly remembered public events of the early seventeenth century were the Gunpowder Plot and the October 1623 rejoicings . A local scribe at Symondsbury in Dorset usually recorded in his chronology only variations in the weather and their impact on the harvest ; the Prince 's return from Spain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other triumphs ; at the time of the Petition of Right , for example . There may have been some element of elite sponsorship of the celebrations that greeted the King 's assent to the Petition : when his reply was reported to the Commons , Sir John Maynard moved to make bonfires all over the town , and the House rose so that members could spread the glad news . But even if they were not entirely spontaneous , the celebrations were certainly popular . Some of the revellers thought that they were celebrating because the Duke of Buckingham had been sent to the Tower , and boys tore down the scaffold on Tower Hill , saying that they would have a new one built for the Duke ' .24 An incident at Windsor is a good example of the interaction between Custom and Inversion SI elite and popular politics . When they heard that the King had given way over the Petition the town 's inhabitants made a bonfire outside the castle gate . The Laudian Richard Montagu , who was both a canon of Windsor and a royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of the celebration he told the townsfolk , they should answer it ; warned them not to ring the bells , and tried to stamp out the flames.25 Montagu dramatically personifies the dispute that was ranging the King and a considerable segment of the Commons on opposite sides ; already under attack in Parliament , on the very day that the incident at Windsor was reported to the House he was elected Bishop of Chichester . His rage at the bonfire ? was it perhaps deliberately put there to provoke him and other residents of the castle ? ? demonstrates the Court clergy 's total lack of understanding of the strength of popular opinion , and their well-founded fear that the lower orders could no longer be controlled . Montagu was not the only cleric to be upset by the public mood . The much more moderate John Rous was distinctly uncomfortable when his Suffolk neighbours muttered against the government . No great admirer of Buckingham , Rous still condemned the libellous verses against him : thus foully will the vulgar disgrace him whose greatness they hate . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintances were certainly shocking . In the summer of 1628 disquiet about royal policies had caused indiscreet people , he noted , to be incensed , to rove , and project ' . There was even a secret whispering ' that the King might be overthrown and replaced by his sister , Elizabeth of Bohemia . When the new prince , the future Charles II , was born Rous heard glances of jealousy ' , inspired , he thought , by some puritans disallowing of the king and queen 's match : ' Rous got his country intelligence ' from all the common sources that , as Richard Cust has shown , helped to spread political news : corantoes for foreign affairs , proclamations , occasional reports by MPs , political ballads , and general gossip.z8 Charges by the judges at the assizes , and the sermons of prominent clergymen were also occasions for the dissemination of news and propaganda . In 1625 , when Charles I was on his way to Plymouth to inspect the fleet that was preparing to sail for Cadiz , he stopped at Bruton , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached on the text , Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered ' .29 The subsequent military failure suggested that God had not after all arisen , and not far away at Hooke , in Dorset , a local parson soon got into trouble for preaching that the land was not governed by // justice but by bribery and extortion ' ( he was echoing the charges that were beginning to circulate against Buckingham ) , and that God 's anger at this had been shown in the late repulse ' at Cadiz . ' " The ideas expressed by people below the elite , when we can hear their voices , thus do not seem very different from those of their superiors . A list of grievances in Sir Edward Conway 's papers , drawn from the observation of the people 's speeches ' early in James I 's reign , included many of the same complaints the King was hearing from the gentry : high taxes , excessive royal bounty to favourites , judicial corruption , and ? something especially disturbing to the simple Gospellers ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of an alliance with the Protestant Dutch . Others besides the gentry thought James 's kingship lacking in proper masculine vigour , and made unfavourable comparisons with his predecessor ; a jeer ' making the rounds in Essex referred to King Elizabeth and Queen James ' , an Anglican cleric later recalled . James was cold and remote during his public appearances , not delighting in popular salutations ' , Conway 's informants complained , and they naturally recalled that the manner of their late Queen was otherwise ' . Most disturbing of all , it was said that James purposeth to alter our manner of government and that fault be found with our Common Law ' . " This rough correspondence between elite and popular political ideas continued at least until the civil war . The similarities were not confined to the expression of grievances . Almost everyone believed in patriarchal order in the family , and thus by analogy in monarchy ? the rumblings that so disturbed John Rous might indicate a desire to replace one monarch by another , but not to destroy monarchy itself . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many people still rejected exalted theories of royal prerogative . Thomas Scott and some of his Canterbury neighbours certainly did , and at Barnstaple in 1629 people were asking pointed questions concerning the rights and prerogatives of Kings ' . The gentry were not alone in appealing to law and custom when they felt abused : nobody thought it strange when a Dorchester butcher , conscripted for the Isle de Rile because his family were at odds with the town 's governors , vehemently protested about the injustices of the impressment system.j2 And nobody thought it strange when ordinary people protested at having soldiers billeted on them , with little expectation that they would ever be paid for the privilege . In 1628 complaints about billeting poured in from every county in England , and in many places there was organized , sometimes violent , resistance.33 // Certainly no one thought it strange when people protested at what they regarded as oppressive or illegal taxes . This kind of resistance has been described as a luxury for the gentry , and it is true that the gentry usually took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though in some counties where the JPs agreed to contribute they then had difficulty collecting the money : many people would contribute only in a parliamentary way ' . When another benevolence was demanded in 1622 such protests as occurred came primarily from the gentry and a handful of peers . Although the example set by such powerful people was important , it is clear that by the later 162os resistance cut across class boundaries . Trying to collect the 1626 Free Gift , the Gloucestershire JPs reported that they had received the almost universal answer : That they humbly submitted themselves and their estates to be disposed of by his Majesty , by way of parliament . ' No doubt this was the answer the JPs wanted ? they may have dictated it themselves ? but it is highly unlikely that the people they were pretending to consult would have disagreed with it.3 ' The frequency with which punitive impressment had to be used against the inferior sort ' ? 15o Loan resisters were conscripted in Gloucestershire alone ? also shows how widespread opposition was at this level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a parliamentary way ' confirms the convergence of attitudes between the gentry and their inferiors.35 In 1625 an MP observed that illegal taxes had always bred tumults and commotions ' .36 There was little resistance to the admittedly ludicrously under-assessed parliamentary subsidies , whereas any exaction of questionable legality ? the Loan , tonnage and poundage after 1628 , Ship Money in the 163os ? invariably provoked a chorus of protest . The story of Ship Money is too well known to need repeating ? the early placidity , the later open resistance , the tendency throughout for people to try to avoid paying on technical grounds , questioning specific assessments rather than following Hampden in challenging the levy 's constitutionality . But the collection of Ship Money , like the enforcement of any other kind of law , ultimately depended on the consent of the governed . By 1639 people were refusing to pay , boycotting auctions of distrained cattle , and rescuing constables arrested for non-co-operation . Joan Kent quotes a high sheriff who ruefully admitted that even the bravest constable dare do nothing but what the parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergence of interests and outlook between the gentry and the lesser folk . Some years ago Richard Cust and Peter Lake drew attention to an important speech by Sir Richard // Grosvenor in 1624 , in which he urged the Cheshire freeholders to take an active part in public affairs . Grosvenor , they suggested , wanted to encourage the fullest popular involvement in the machinery of politics ' because he assumed that the commoners ' priorities would be the same as those of the local gentry . The majority at all levels of Cheshire society were violently opposed to popery and to the Spanish Match , just as a few years later they were angered by the Arminians and the Duke of Buckingham.38 The grievances of the 162os ? billeting , impressment , arbitrary imprisonment , and prerogative taxation ? could in the end be righted only in Parliament . This surely explains the widening interest in parliamentary affairs during the decade , and why John Rous , for example , was so often embroiled in political arguments during these years . In a conversation in November 1627 his companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontents , for the parliament being crossed , expenses , hazard of ships , etc , in a way that shows that they had been following public affairs quite closely.39 Similar signs of popular political involvement can be seen in some , though not all , parliamentary elections . It is difficult to generalize about the electoral politics of the 16zos , but in some places at least national politics were beginning to intrude . It was the practice in many counties , Mark Kishlansky reminds us , to secure prior agreement among the gentry and then present the candidates to the freeholders for formal approval . But this custom was becoming harder to sustain . There were still peers ? the Earl of Derby in Lancashire , Pembroke in Wiltshire , and Warwick in Essex , for example ? who could get their clients or allies elected . But in many other counties the gentry had established effective control . The boroughs were more easily managed , but a strong body of opinion was offended by attempts to maintain aristocratic control . The nomination of members by letters from magnates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to bring in servitude ' . Thomas Scott agreed : free parliaments , he said , can not long continue if the freedom and right of elections be violently or deceitfully taken from us. ' 4 ? The general drift of Commons ' decisions in disputed elections , Derek Hirst has argued , was towards a broadening of the franchise . The commonality ought to have a voice , the House voted in a typical case . ' The cumulative impression given by these decisions is that Sir Richard Grosvenor was not alone in believing that the freeholders and subsidymen who comprised the bulk of the county electorates had much the // same outlook as the gentry : that they too were against arbitrary imprisonment , unparliamentary taxation , and the toleration of popery and Arminianism ' . To empower such men was for MPs like Grosvenor the best way to protect the shared liberties of the Ancient Constitution . In a debate on the election at Great Marlow in November 164o , Sir Simonds D'Ewes ? certainly no radical firebrand ? announced that the poorest man ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of England ' . Parliament-men were to sing a very different tune a few years later . " This does not to mean that Court influence was negligible ? even in 1625 it could get members elected in populous shires like Kent ? and a determined high sheriff could still control an election , especially if he was directed by one of the local magnates , as was the case in Dorset a year later . " In 1628 this kind of manipulation was more difficult ; it was easily defeated in Essex , for example . And there are signs of more populist electioneering methods , as by Coryton and Eliot in Cornwall . Their appeal to the people was based on what their enemies described as their pretence of suffering for their country ' in resisting the Loan , and it was brilliantly successful . " The most divisive issue , for the common people as well as for the gentry , was religion . But the nature of the division depended as much on where you lived as on anything else . There were places where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformation ? in towns like Banbury , Dorchester , and Gloucester . There were others where there was greater division , as in Salisbury and other cathedral cities . And there were places where the godly made little headway , as in towns in and on the edge of custom-bound , culturally traditional farming regions ? places like Sherborne , Blandford , and Bruton.45 Religion differed from constitutional issues because it was less clearly a matter of custom ? or if it was a matter of custom , because people so often disagreed on which side the weight of custom stood . Was the customary position that of the defenders of ritual practices in and outside the church ; of the bowings at the name of Jesus , of the kneeling to receive communion , of the churchale and the revel feast ? Or was it that of their godly critics , who could equally plausibly claim to represent the traditions of the Elizabethan church , uncorrupted by Laudian innovation ? Long usage ' , Sir Henry Slingsby reflected , was the key to popular acceptance , and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may not have been absolutely clear in religious matters , // it was much clearer with regard to politics and the constitution : the popular ' position was almost invariably the customary or traditional one . Long usage : such time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary , time out of mind , such time as will beget a custom , so Thomas Hedley explained it in 161o . As he pointed out , customs were usually confined to certain and particular places ' ? the custom of the manor , of the parish , of the county . But all of them came together and were subsumed in the Common Law , the custom of the realm ' . ' ' The rights and liberties of the Ancient Constitution which the gentry were defending against Buckingham could easily be equated with the birthrights of freeborn Englishmen of lesser status . And however sharp the religious divide in 164o , it does not overcome the distinct smell of political alienation that is also noticeable in many parts of the kingdom . Even in 1625 the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Suckling because they were worried that he might incline rather to the King than to the subject ' .48 It is easier to sum up popular attitudes as negatives rather than as positives . Most people were suspicious of Court corruption and extravagance ; were ferociously anti-Spanish , as the joyous celebrations of October 1623 demonstrated ; and were fervently anti-Catholic . In the 163os they became increasingly hostile to bishops ; not necessarily to episcopacy as such , but to its Laudian variety . There is much evidence for this , from the sympathetic crowds attending Prynne , Burton , and Bastwick during their journey into exile , to the numerous verse libels circulating during the Bishops ' Wars . In 1637 Laud was informed that the preciser faction ' in Dorset were having some success in convincing people that the new liturgy printed for the Scottish church included sundry notorious points of popery ' .49 This does not mean that public opinion was predominately puritan in any sense in which we might use the term . Judith Maltby has argued persuasively that a moderate ( non-puritan , non-Laudian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English laity in the early seventeenth century . ' " And all over England there were defenders of conservative culture ? of maypoles , churchales , and bear-baitingswho were conformable Protestants though certainly not puritans . Supporters of moral reformation thought such people easy pickings for popish evangelists : Lewis Owen denounced an Augustinian friar , a former actor , who had been sent into England in the 162os to make converts among balladmakers , players , tobacconists , and tinkers ' . " But the libels attacking puritan sexual hypocrisy and cultural oppressiveness were just // as common as those on the other side : they surface in Wells , Bridport , Dorchester , Stratford-upon-Avon , and other places . Christian liberty ' , one of them sneered , was simply an invitation to have all things made common , so that each man may take another 's wife ' . Like this one , several libels circulating in the 163os welcomed the godly 's departure across the Atlantic : I wish Old England forth may spew I That they may sovereign in the New ' , one recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many issues . In 1610 James I complained of the common printing and dispersing of traitorous and seditious books and of profane and scurrilous pamphlets and libels , and called for legislation to suppress them . The Earl of Salisbury was at that time a favourite target . " Every major political development ? the execution of Sir Walter Ralegh , the Spanish Match , the impeachment of Buckingham ? produced its crop of libels , some primarily aimed at an educated readership , others more popular . Sung in taverns and handed around at fairs , they were , Attorney-General Heath declared in 1627 , the epidemical disease of these days ' . He was speaking in Star Chamber at the trial of three fiddlers who had been singing ballads attacking Buckingham at various places in the London area.54 Ballad-singers were often first with the news , sometimes even ahead of it , as happened in 1623 when some of them celebrated a premature report of the return of Prince Charles from Spain ; the singers were imprisoned , but they had merely anticipated the event by a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united a large segment of the gentry ; it also did much to politicize their inferiors . The allegation that he had poisoned King James was widely dispersed and given the usual gendered twist by the emphasis on the role of his recusant mother . In Suffolk , John Rous heard strange rhymes and songs ' about the Duke in March 1628 , and soon rumours were spreading that he had been sent to the Tower ; similar stories were heard when the King accepted the Petition of Rights ? A visiting Scotsman named Melvin , misled , he afterwards claimed , by the report of the common people . . . into the vulgar error of the time , gives us a glimpse into the rumour mill in London in the spring of 1628 , which even included stories that implicated Charles in the murder of his own father . Melvin saw the Duke 's crimes as presaged by earlier events : Prince Henry , he asserted , had been poisoned by Sir Thomas Overbury , who had then been silenced in his turn by being murdered in the Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesuitish Scotchmen ' ) , wanted Parliament dissolved , after which he and the King // with a great army of horse and foot would war against the commonalty ' . With England engulfed in civil war , the Spaniards would then invade ? for this kingdom is already sold to the enemy by the Duke ' . The government took Melvin seriously enough for Secretary Conway to examine him and for Attorney-General Heath to draw up the indictment against him , but in spite of his confession a King 's Bench jury obstinately refused to convict him . The authorities not surprisingly remained alert when Melvin 's allegations continued to circulate , and the Attorney-General was still investigating them in the autumns ' The assassinations of 1628 ? first of Buckingham 's astrologer-sorcerer , Dr Lambe , and then of the Duke himself ? provide some further clues to the political outlook of many commoners . Lambe 's role as a conjuror or witch ? as a source of evil and satanic disorder ? made him a subject of even greater fascination at the popular than at the elite level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Windsor , and in 1624 he was convicted of the statutory rape of an 11-year old girl ; he was also said to have supplied Buckingham 's estranged sister-in-law , Lady Purbeck , with powders and potions ' to use against the Duke himself . However , Buckingham may already have been consulting him too by this time , and he appears to have got the sorcerer a pardon in return for a promise to enter the Duke 's services$ Lambe had for a long time been addicted to dangerous dabbling in state matters . He had claimed to have secret information about the Gunpowder Plot , and years later an old servant recalled his predicting that James I would not die a natural death ; it was lucky for Buckingham that she did not come forward when the poisoning accusations were being investigated . He was also said to have prophesied in 1626 that Buckingham would have only two more years of power . Lambe 's influence over the Duke was soon being publicized in the libels . After the disastrous Isle de Rhe expedition one of them pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the French rams ? ' 59 The sorcerer was said to be providing the favourite with strange philtres to incite I Chaste ladies ' loves to give his lust delight ' . Lambe , one ballad clearly aimed at a popular audience declared , was the devil of our nation ' : For such a wicked wretch In England hath liv 'd seldom . Nor never such a witch , For his skill from Hell came.b ? Lambe 's murder by a London mob after he had been attending a play with one of his minions ' was widely seen as a warning to the Duke . // If his master were there , they would give him as much , some of the attackers were said to have shouted . A paper found on a post in Coleman Street bore a similar warning : they intend shortly to use him worse than they did the Doctor : : ' Let Charles and George do what they can , The duke shall die like Doctor Lambe , another libel warned : it was still circulating in Suffolk in September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already noted the spate of mock epitaphs that Buckingham 's murder provoked , and their wide circulation . These were not the only signs of popular rejoicing at his death , and of approval of the murderer , Felton . John Vicars , the ultra-puritan minister at Stamford , asked his flock to pray that the King too might rejoice in the death of that wicked Achan ' . When Felton was being taken to London on his way to the Tower there were fears of demonstrations in his favour , and of a possible rescue attempt by sailors and people by the way ' . Unpaid and mutinous sailors were particularly hostile because Buckingham had been involved in violent scuffles with them at Portsmouth , and had had some of them hanged : their friends naturally vowed revenge . Some demonstrations did indeed occur during Felton 's journey to London ; at Kingston-upon-Thames a woman shouted God bless thee , little David ' ( Buckingham , obviously , being Goliath ) . The Duke 's funeral was held at night to reduce the danger of unseemly outbreaks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded more like joy than commiseration ' . An escort of the London trained bands , ordered to trail their pikes and beat dolefully ' , instead beat up again with courage and shouldered their pikes ' . Gz All this might suggest that there were no real differences between the outlooks of the two levels of the political nation that we are considering . Even in the enclosure riots discussed earlier in this chapter there are features that remind us of the politics of the elite : the emphasis on law and tradition , for example . The political culture of both groups was shaped by the legitimizing force of custom . Custom sanctioned the rights of access of countrymen to common land , as well as the right of Parliament to give its assent to lawful taxes . At the other end of the spectrum , Parliament showed its familiarity with the old world of custom by sometimes inflicting punishments resembling the shaming rituals so common in popular justice . When in 1621 the monopolist Sir Francis Mitchell was sent to the Tower , he had to walk there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a paper declaring his offences , rather than going by water in a way more fitting for a gentleman 6o Custom and Inversion prisoner . In the same year two bailiffs who had arrested an MP 's servant were sentenced to ride backwards through Cheapside , with their faces to their horses ' tails ' . " In spite of these similiarities , the lower orders did have their own ways of looking at politics , and a somewhat different vocabulary . Popular actions were more likely than those of their betters to incorporate festive elements . The enclosure riot was often preceded by a ritual procession led by pipes and drums and banners , and followed by a celebration with cakes and ale . In much the same way schoolboys sometimes had their feasts to accompany the rebellious barring out ' rituals that Keith Thomas has described . Popular uprisings sometimes started during a time of festive celebration , as in 1549 in Norfolk , when Kett 's rebellion began with a riot at a festival commemorating St Thomas Becket . Seventeenth-century fen riots were touched off by football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Rogationtide procession was diverted into an attack on hedges recently planted by the lord of the manor.6 ? Popular disorders were also likely to involve women as well as men . It has often been observed that women played a prominent role in both enclosure and grain riots , and that male participants frequently disguised themselves as women . There is nothing particularly surprising about this : villagers generally accepted that women had a responsibility to share in the defence of communal rights . In a dispute over a common at Acton , Middlesex , in 1616 , the women took their turn at watching , to keep out cattle belonging to the inhabitants of Willesden , who also claimed the land . For the authorities the fact that women often played leadership roles was another , more disturbing , matter , and severe punishments were inflicted when it happened and things got out of hand . A well-known case is that of Ann Carter , hanged for her prominent part in the riots at Maldon , Essex , in 1629.65 Some of the punishments were less savage but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women involved in some enclosure riots were sentenced to be ducked in the cucking-stool , the men fined and made to stand in the pillory bareheaded and in women 's apparel ' . The actual violence does not sound very serious : rotten eggs were thrown at a bailiff , women used cartwheel grease to blacken the face of one of the new landlord 's servants , and said that if his master had been there they would have christened him ' with the ladle one of them was carrying . This suggests that a skimmington was in prospect , for it was from that implement ? the skimming ladle ? that the ritual got its name.66 One Custom and Inversion interpretation of inversion rituals of this kind , popular with judges and other male authority figures , was that the men were trying to escape detection , simply hiding behind the skirts of the women ' , who would be likely to receive lighter punishment because of their natural frailty . In 1608 the Southampton magistrates could not believe that women grain rioters had acted on their own initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' .6 ' It is easy to see why the authorities disliked these riotous customs : they involved deliberate transgressions of divinely sanctioned gender codes which even the rioters normally took for granted . Moralists denounced the satanic influences which led to cross-dressing , and which caused women to step out of their natural spheres to take on both the styles of dress and the activist roles which properly belonged to men.68 Cross-dressing was frequently held to aggravate other offences against order . In a charivari at Wells against a puritan constable , one of the participants rode on horseback in women 's clothes , carrying a spinning wheel , to ridicule the unpopular officer . In his complaint to Star Chamber the constable drew attention to the disorders then erupting in the Midlands ? the year was 1607 ? and suggested that the Wells incident ought to be firmly dealt with because it was part of a general breakdown of law and order.69 Some of these incidents remind us that the elite and the populace used somewhat different metaphorical systems and political vocabularies . When they thought about violations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their superiors , did so in a language that repeatedly stressed the evils of a world turned upside down , and made regular use of metaphors of inversion . Given the assumptions that were routinely made about the correspondences between the public and the private spheres , it is not surprising that in the popular vocabulary those metaphors were frequently based on distinctions of sex and gender . The skimmington is a classic example . I have argued elsewhere that there is a direct connection between the domestic form of the skimmington ? in which the inversion of gender roles in marriage is held up to public shame ? and the public form , as in the riots around 1630 in Dean and Braydon Forests , led by the mythic Captain or Lady Skimmington . ' ? All that we need to note at present is that both forms became especially frequent precisely when fears of a breakdown of obedience in family and state were most acute . The crisis of order ' of the period 156o ? 164o generated widespread male alarm about many different kinds of disorder : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all perceived as unusually rebellious . People at the lower end of the social scale shared some , but not all , of these fears . Many lower-class men were certainly concerned about unruly women , and were active in prosecuting witches , putting scolds in the cuckingstool , and taking the initiative ? sometimes in defiance of authority ? in shaming masculine women and their feeble husbands . They also worried about insubordination by servants or apprentices . But the just , stable social order was equally likely to be threatened from outside the community by people who violated the norms of neighbourly conduct : the enclosing landlord , the rapacious grain dealer . Concern about such matters cut across political and religious loyalties . The Gillingham Forest rioters were largely immune to puritan influences . But the godly inhabitants of Dorchester seem to have been just as sympathetic to their cause as their much less puritan rural neighbours . " In such cases localist feeling and support for ancient custom clearly had more force than religion . As we saw in the previous chapter , the gendered habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine virtue , for example ? came naturally to the gentry . It came even more naturally to the commoners . Women 's involvement in such popular collective actions as grain and enclosure riots might be tolerated or even welcomed . And in spite of the prevailing value-system , some women took at least an occasional interest in public affairs . When bailiffs came to distrain the property of Ship Money refusers in one Northamptonshire village , a local diarist reports that the women assembled and some men and affrighted them , there was much running with forks and cowlstaffs ' . Some women were encouraged by their husbands to be politically aware . Thomas Scott 's wife had certainly mastered the essentials of the antiCourt argument in 1628 . She refused to accept the soldiers the Canterbury magistrates tried to billet on her and gave them good arguments , Scott says , of her own mother wit , or remembering what before the parliament I and other men had talked ' . J2 She was a woman of high status , married to an MP , but other Canterbury women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years earlier , when Buckingham passed through the city on his way to Dover , there was a riot in which the wives of unpaid soldiers attacked his coach , a ballad reports , with knitting needles and with ladles , Spits , fireforks and legs of cradles ' . Once again the ladle , the implement used in the skimmington , is high on the list of weapons.73 // But there were limits to the public tolerance of this kind of behaviour . People of all classes feared chaos and disorder , and women were commonly thought to be the agents through which the forces of darkness did their work , because they were less controlled by reason than men . Besides being typically inclined to scolding and witchraft , they were also more attracted than men to dangerous forms of religious extremism . King James expressed the common view when he regretted how busy many be who . . . go about to seduce poor simple women , and how they prevail ' .74 Mysogynist complaints by men about women have a long history , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early seventeenth century . Women seem to have had a particularly bad influence on the universities , Robert Bowyer reported : Who knoweth not how the manners of young men are corrupted and drawn from their studies by the ordinary sight and conversation with women : who knoweth not how covetous heads of houses are to maintain , prefer and provide for their wives and children : who knoweth not how much women prevail with their husbands to the overthrow of learning , discipline , yea and of the colleges . " Some blamed the Court of High Commission 's permissiveness . The court , it was alleged in 161o , allowed women excessively generous separation allowances , to the great encouragement of wives to be disobedient and contemptuous against their husbands ' . j6 What men in the early seventeenth century most feared was the disorder implicit in women 's refusal to accept the submissive role in the family that convention assigned them . This could cause disruption from the highest to the . lowest levels of society . One of the many ballads from James I 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of female authority : But when the sole commanding Amongst the females fall , For want of understanding They commonly mar all . Nor doth alone the City Such precedents afford ; In Court , the more the pity Some ladies play the lord . // The consequence , needless to say , was likely to be religious apostacy ( as in the women of Buckingham 's family ) : And then to be in fashion , She turns Catholical ? Oh vile abomination , The Pope can pardon all . " The literary controversy that began with the publication of Joseph Swetnam 's Arraignment of Lewd , Idle , froward and unconstant women in 1615 has received a good deal of recent attention . ' $ It might perhaps be argued that Swetnam 's work , and that of his detractors , was not written for a popular audience ? the frequent use of classical allusions , among other things , might support such a view . Once again we encounter the difficulty of defining popular ' . Swetnam 's readership was probably much the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written ? a readership that included the wits and idlers of London , the young gentlemen of the Inns of Court and hangers-on around Whitehall , but also the more literate apprentices and journeymen in the City , the sort of people who often attended the public theatre , and who in 1624 thronged to Middleton 's highly political satire , A Game at Chess . They were not the really poor , but neither were they universally drawn from the privileged and well-born . Annabel Patterson has drawn attention to the socially mixed character of theatre audiences in Shakespeare 's time , and the same point could be made about the readership of libels and pamphlets . Swetnam 's audience spanned both the elite and the popular , but he was probably aiming somewhat more at the lower than the upper end of the spectrum . " The Arraignment was inspired by the Overbury affair ? as we have seen , the greatest of the numerous Jacobean Court scandals . Swetnam 's denunciations of female inconstancy and duplicity , vanity and extravagance , greed and voracious sexuality , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somerset , and her friend Mrs Turner . During the trial the women of the Howard family quickly became targets of popular hatred : after the Somersets had been pardoned a mob chased the Queen 's coach , railing and reviling ' , on the mistaken impression that Frances and her mother , the Countess of Suffolk , were inside . They were not alone in arousing such animosity . When Lady Roos was being taken to the Tower after her conviction for slandering the Exeters , it was reported that she too was cursed horribly by the people ' . A libel // described her mother , Lady Lake , as a bitch of Court , a common stinking snake ' 80 Swetnam 's work played on these feelings , and it was sensationally popular ? ten editions by 1637 ? provoking a flood of rejoinders , both pro and con , during the next few years . The controversy about women 's moral failings soon focused on styles of dress , particularly the masculine ones which women were adopting at this time , and the feminine ' ones which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaffold speech Mrs Turner penitently rejected the whole wardrobe of court vanities ' , but she had been one of the main promoters of the masculine style ( starched yellow bands and cuffs were her particular trademark ) , and the Countess , in her low-cut French doublet ' , one of the most prominent trend-setters . She had enslaved her new husband , one critic of the Court declared , by the use of yellow bands , dusted hair , curled crisped , frizzled , sleek skins , opened breasts beyond accustomed modesty ' . And the dangerous new fashions were spreading into circles outside the Court . Yellow bands , Barnaby Rich declared in 1619 , are become so common , to every giddy-headed gallant , and light heeled mistress , that methinks a man should not hardly be hanged without a yellow band ! A year later the clergy in their pulpits and the ballad-singers in the streets were still denouncing the insolence and impudence of women , and their immodest fashions.8 ' When the pamphleteers denounced wicked women they were also denouncing other public evils which James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so only belatedly , as when he issued a proclamation against the masculine fashions in women 's dress . They were denouncing Court extravagance and immorality , which James had done so little to curb . They were denouncing unhealthy , sinister foreign influences which the new styles of dress symbolized . In 1621 an MP complained that young men were spending more on roses and shirts than all their fathers ' apparel was worth , and wanted a law passed against that fantastical change of French , Spanish , German fashions , and sometimes mixture of them all together ' which had so corrupted English virtue . An attack on Spanish fashions could easily be read as an oblique denunciation of James I 's pro-Spanish foreign policies . " Coded criticism of James can be found in many places in the pamphlets . Swetnam and other popular authors denounced the prevailing effeminacy , the lack of martial vigour which the new styles reflected . A man triumphs at wars , but a woman rejoiceth more at peace , Swetnam declared ? and it was well known // which James rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other masculine recreations of former times , the author of Haec Vir : Or the Womanish Man demanded . Englishmen had abandoned the arms that used to shake all Christendom , and were sunk in softness , dullness , and effeminate niceness ' . They had even taken up shuttlecock ? a girl 's game if ever there was one.8 ; Complaints about male degeneration did not end with James I 's death . Prynne 's attack on long hair ? The Unloveliness of Lovelockes ? was published in 1628 , and contains the same kind of moralizings as those of his Jacobean predecessors . Young men had become womanish not only in exility of voice , tenderness of body , levity of apparel , wantonness of pace and gesture , but even the very length and culture of their locks and hair ' . Martin Parker pursued the same theme a few years later in his ballad , Knavery in All Trades ' : Our men are effeminate , Which all their manhood disgraces , And makes our foes of late , To jeer us to our faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of examples of martial valour among women to throw at him , and once again the contrast between their behaviour and that of King James must have been obvious . A pamphlet entitled Ester bath hang 'd Haman listed the usual biblical examples , but also Boadicea , who defended the liberty of her country against the strength of the Romans . . . and made them feel that a woman could conquer them who had conquered almost all the men of the then known world ' . The favourable view of Boadicea shows that this pamphlet was not directed to an elite readership : to the educated , Boadicea personified feminine , and therefore barbaric and unregulated , resistance to the rational , masculine order the Romans represented . Inevitably , though , the pamphlet ended with Queen Elizabeth , a pattern for the best men to imitate ' . " The pamphleteers were not simply criticizing James 's feeble foreign policy . They were arguing , as many others were arguing at about this time , that their entire world was out of joint . In 1621 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long list of ills that needed reforming , blaming them all on worldly churchmen , hypocritical puritans , plotting Jesuits , usurers , and so on . Many of these evils he ( or she ) thought were the result of the growing debasement of public virtue by the values of the market-place . Mule Sacke denounces the improving // of lands , racking of rents , destruction of ancient hospitality , and oppression of poor farmers and tenants ' . The masculine styles of female dress , the author of Hic Muller declared , were especially attractive to social upstarts , though contradictorily they also seem to have been invented by noblewomen to make their inferiors look ridiculous . But in either case the connection between gender inversion and social inversion is clear . ' All this , Haec Vir suggests , can only be reformed when men abandon their effeminacy in both dress and behaviour , and women their masculine styles . As in the circumstances of female assertiveness which provoked the skimmington ritual , women have stepped out of their customarily submissive place only because men have allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends the argument by calling on men to be men in shape , men in show , men in words , men in actions , men in counsel , men in example , and the hitherto effeminate man agrees : Henceforth we will live nobly like ourselves : It does not require much imagination to translate this into a commentary on James I 's policies and the moral failings of his Court . " There was , then , a shared culture which linked all sectors of the political nation through such broad clusters of ideas as the Ancient Constitution , anti-popery , and Protestant nationalism , and through shared enemies like the Duke of Buckingham . But certain aspects of that common culture seem to have been stressed more strongly at the popular than at the elite level : notably those parts of it connected with issues of gender and inversion . Before the civil war the resemblances between the two cultures may have been more significant than the differences . As we shall see in the remaining chapters of this book , this was to change after 164o . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitably commonplace conclusion that the civil wars and revolution of the midcentury formed a great watershed . // THE POLITICAL NATION AND THE ENGLISH REVOLUTION The historical meaning of the violent events that occurred in midseventeenth-century Britain remains as fiercely contested as ever . Did they amount to a revolution , a rebellion , a civil war , a war of three kingdoms ' ? From the days of Hobbes , Clarendon , and Ludlow , historians have endlessly debated the subject , usually revealing as much about their own political prejudices as about the historical situation they are describing . Was this one of the great revolutions of the modern world , somehow connected with great impersonal forces like capitalism , liberal individualism , or religious toleration ? Or was it simply the fortuitous result of a series of accidents , just a bit of bad luck ? The disagreements have recently become more profound than ever , and it is now fashionable to call the whole notion of an English revolution ' into question . Conrad Russell has given his collected essays on the period the dismissive title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the short duration and ultimate failure of the revolution ( or whatever we choose to call it ) . Any explanation of why a revolution ( under some definition of the term ) occurred between 1642 and 1649 gives us little help when we go on to ask why that revolution failed and there was a Restoration in 166o . Yet we need , surely , to understand both the revolution and the Restoration . It may help us to do this if we retrace our steps to the beginning of the troubles ' . This may not be as easy as it sounds . For when , the reader may well ask , did the troubles begin ? Was it with the outbreak of the strife over the new Scottish liturgy , in 1637 ? Or was it somewhat earlier , soon after 1625 perhaps , with the crown 's adoption of new counsels ' in the state and Arminian innovation in the church ? Could it have been ( for , hush , there may still be secret Whigs among us ) on the arrival of James I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of divine right ? Perhaps we ought to go all the way back to the 153os , to the divisions over religious matters introduced by the Protestant // Reformation ? Or even to that same remote period because , as some have suggested , that is when English society began to refashion itself through the rise of the gentry ' , with all the strains and stresses in the body politic that followed ? No book of this length can possibly disentangle the complex choices that these ( and no doubt other ) alternative explanations require . Some concessions have to be made to the brevity of human life , and besides , our subject is not the causes of the British whatever-it-was . The only sensible procedure is to return to the actual subject of the book , the relationship between elite and popular politics , which we first began , the reader will remember , in the reigns of the first two Smarts . In an earlier chapter we surveyed the politics of the gentry in the i62os . Looking back on that decade from the perspective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of alienation from Court and government that gripped many members of the political nation in the earlier years must have had some relationship to the collapse of the monarchy in the 164os . Yet it soon becomes obvious that there is no necessary correlation between the behaviour of individuals in the two periods . People who opposed the Duke of Buckingham in the 16206 did not necessarily fight for Parliament twenty years later . Once again we need to distinguish between the long and the short term . The longterm , structural problems of the English monarchy , in both church and state , existed in both periods . But in the short term , during the years 1640-2 , the political map was completely redrawn . To appreciate how completely it was redrawn , let us take an example from the west country . The two most active and influential leaders in Dorset politics in the 16206 were Sir Walter Erie of Charborough and Sir John Strangways of Melbury , both of them immensely wealthy and respected figures from the very highest level of the county hierarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends were bitter about Strangways 's unscrupulous manipulation of the 1626 county election , for example . But on national politics their views were very similar . Both were active in Parliament in the impeachment proceedings against Buckingham , and were struck off the commission of the peace in consequence . They were also by far the best-known of the resisters of the 1627 Forced Loan in Dorset . They were both imprisoned for this , and when they got out and were again elected to Parliament in 1628 they promptly renewed their earlier attacks on the crown 's ( and Buckingham 's ) arbitrary policies . After these shared experiences neither , surely , could have imagined that within fifteen years they would be ranged on // opposite sides in a civil war . Yet they were , Strangways as the effective leader of the royalist party in Dorset , Erie as the commander of Parliament 's local forces . Before it was all over both were imprisoned yet again ? Strangways by Parliament in 1645 and on several later occasions , Erie more briefly by the Army in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorset knights usefully exemplify the divisions among the English gentry in the 164os and ' 50S . A full account of elite politics during the Interregnum is beyond the purpose of this chapter ; it will instead take the form of a meditation on certain important themes that may help us to understand the period better . ' Before we proceed , however , some further words of caution are in order . We should not exaggerate the differences in the way the various levels of the political nation viewed the conflict that was engulfing them . The earlier chapters have shown that I am more impressed by the similarities of elite and popular political cultures than by the differences between them . People of all classes listened to the same ballads , and sang them to the same tunes . The popular song Hey then , Up go we ! ' was written early in 1642 . Within a few months , in July , we find the Marquis of Hertford parodying it in a letter to the Queen which shows how familiar the jingle had already become at Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen , and Hey then , Down go they ! ' A few weeks later a ballad-singer in The Bear at Exeter was entertaining an audience that included both gentlemen and commoners with songs lampooning the Five Members and other Roundhead leaders . Satirical songs like these and the well-known God a-mercy , good Scot ' were available to people of all classes when they rubbed shoulders in the inns and taverns . The Cavaliers , of course , had all the best tunes : that of When the King enjoys his own again ' was borrowed for several other popular songs , including one appropriately titled , The World is Turned Upside Down ' . In the 165os seditious Cavalier ballads were sung everywhere from the houses of the gentry to The Black Boy tavern in the Somerset village of Ashcott.3 Yet during this period ballads provide us with somewhat less straightforward clues to public opinion than they do in earlier times . Although some of the ballads of the 162os were written by or for members of Court factions , most of the ballad-writers of that decade were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to be attentive to their market , and to respond to their audience 's assumptions and prejudices . So they did during the 164os , to be sure ; but at the same time ballad-making became a branch of party propaganda . There were now // two alternative , competing markets . The ballads and popular pamphlets can still be used to uncover the political languages and metaphorical systems of the period , and perhaps the opinions of the individuals who collected them , but it would be rash to cite them as evidence for any general shift of opinion from one side to the other . It is not clear how civil-war ballad-writers were paid for their work . Most of them were still , apparently , free-lance authors , in it for the money ; but they were also being recruited and used as propagandists by the two sides . ' - The sheer numbers of new ballads , which proliferated far beyond the output of the 162os , suggests that we have entered a different world . The propaganda war , Joyce Malcolm reminds us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sermons , pamphlets , ballads , and newsbooks , the royalists were primarily concerned with the opinions of the gentry . They routinely sneered at the allegedly plebeian origins of parliamentarian officers , denouncing them for their supposed intention to bring in democracy , anarchy , levelling of degrees and distinctions of rank . Malcolm draws attention to the mocking , aristocratic tone ' used by the royalist Mercurius Aulicus , a tone clearly recognizable in the paper 's account of Goring 's defeat of a small Roundhead force led by an officer named Wansey . The motto on Wansey 's colours was For Lawful Laws and Liberties ' , a tautology which offended Aulicus 's purist author , John Berkenhead , and which he sarcastically dismissed as full of wit and judgement ' . Wansey was a pious watchmaker from Warminster , his humble origins making him , the royalist Sir Edward Walker observed , a person of equal quality with many of the rebels ' officers ' .5 During the war royalist ballad-writers occasionally adopted a popular voice for satirical purposes , as in Alexander Brome 's The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialectb But although some of the grievances they denounced ( the excise is an obvious example ) were shared by gentry and commoners alike , royalist authors generally regarded the populace as the clowns , and the parliamentarian cause as fatally tainted by the plebeian origins of many of its leaders . Even the famous Cavalier conviviality , the familiar call not to think on tomorrow , But tipple and laugh while we may ' , was an expression of class attitudes , an assertion that puritan killjoys were by definition contemptible people of lower rank , the proverbial brewers and draymen.7 The Cavaliers ' scorn for the people is repeatedly evident in their writings . A 1648 ballad , The Anarchie , or the Blest Reformation ' , argued that claims of popular support for Parliament need not be taken seriously // because the Roundhead cause was fatally tainted by its appeal to women and the disorderly : Come clowns , and come boys , Come hober-de-hoyes , Come females of each degree ; Stretch your throats , bring in your votes , And make good the anarchy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus it shall go , ' says Amy ; Nay , thus it shall go , ' says Taffy , I trow ; ' Nay , thus it shall go ; says Jamy . Each stanza ends with a confusion of discordant voices ? of women , Welshmen , and Scots , all obviously marginal people . Who can expect Ought but division ' from the commons , the anonymous author demands : These popular pates reap naught but debates , From that many round-headed beast . In the end , of course , the rabble are easily converted back to monarchy , and Tom and Ralph , Doll and Moll ( the names from the Celtic fringe have now significantly disappeared ) , all join in happily toasting King Charles . ' By 1648 the royalist propagandists had learned from their predecessors ' mistakes , and were trying to reach a more socially diverse readership , an effort that I shall pursue in more detail in the next chapter . But ballads continued to be published that must have been above the heads of any but an educated reader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sneering that Scot , Nevil , and Vane , With the rest of that train Are into Oceana fled . A few lines further on the author refers to the Rota Club . ' Such ballads helped to confirm the gentry 's contempt for radical intellectuals like James Harrington and his friends , but it is unlikely that they made any impact on the common people . Regular exposure to the newsbooks may have solidified the loyalties of some partisans of one side or the other , but it made others totally cynical . Wealthy and educated readers could choose from among many competing papers according to which side they were on , knowing well enough that the news they read was often censored and no more reliable // than the output of today 's journalistic gutters . One Dorset gentleman , John Fitzjames of Leweston , observed in 1648 that much of the news dares not at first ( many times not at all ) show itself in the pamphlets , instancing the absence of printed reports about the return of the presbyterian Eleven Members ' to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his London correspondent to send him the Leveller The Moderate , the better-named Moderate Intelligencer , and the royalist Mercurius Pragmaticus ; it was always his pastime , he said , to read what can be said on both sides ' . In several other letters he expressed further doubts about the veracity of the newsbooks , asking for an account of recent events beyond that of the mrcuries , and for news in writing , as well as lies in print ' . " ' Yet however sceptical they may have been , country gentlemen always panted for news from London , and freely shared it with their neighbours . In September 1648 Sir John Gell sent newsbooks to his son in Derbyshire , asking him to pass them on to Sir Cornelius Vermuyden , the fen-drainage projector . In 1648 Sir Ralph Assheton of Whalley Abbey was having newsletters from Scotland sent to his steward in Lancashire , to be handed on to Assheton 's cousin . He also tried to arrange for pamphlets to be sent down and sold by booksellers in Clitheroe and other small towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news it was no marvel if they be ignorant of the truth of passages ' . He wrote on the day of Charles I 's execution ; it would be nice to know if he was involved in the distribution of the King 's posthumous best-seller , Eikon Basilike , a few weeks later . " Whatever our conclusions may be about the level of the political nation to which particular pamphlets or ballads were directed , it is undeniable that many of them included elements that were common to the political culture of all classes . But it would be absurd to blur the differences between an earl at the top of the hierarchy , and a common soldier trailing a pike at the bottom , or indeed between a peer of any degree and a commoner . Let us , then , follow the old , tried and true method of analysing English society by starting at the top , with the peers : how did the civil war and revolution affect their relative position in the political nation ? The first , inescapable fact that we confront is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For months only a pathetic handful of peers had been attending , to sit and tell tales by the fireside , as a newspaper sarcastically reported . The bookseller George Thomason came across a mocking description of the four most regular attenders during // those last days : Salisbury the valiant , Pembroke the witty , Denbigh the chaste , and Mulgrave the pretty ' . He did the necessary decoding for us : coward , fool , whoremaster , and dwarf respectively . Obviously this is not a fair estimate of the House of Lords after the second civil war . By December 1648 the Army was firmly in control , and one might equally well point out that after Pride 's Purge only a tiny fraction of the members of the House of Commons attended . If we retrace our steps by a few months , before most of the parliamentarian Lords were frightened away by the Army , we may get a fairer impression . We shall be wise , though , to distinguish between the influence of the House of Lords as an institution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords During the Civil War , C. H. Firth took the view that the House of Lords was declining in power and influence long before its abolition . Many of the peers who had not joined the King at Oxford wanted a compromise peace , but were never able to do much more than act as a brake on the more warlike Commons . In 1643 the Upper House even lost control of its own membership . When a majority wanted to readmit the Earl of Holland and other peers who had returned after defecting to the King the Commons would not allow them to do it , and a subsequent attempt to seat them in 1647 also failed . Firth recounts the Commons ' repeated successes in pressuring or manoeuvring the Lords into doing what they did not want to do ? over the Self-Denying Ordinance , over peace negotiations , and so on . The Lords could win temporary concessions , and there was a brief recovery of the House 's prestige in 1647 when some of its most active members supported the Army against the Presbyterians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firth argued , their substantial power was gone ' . " We now know that Firth ignored one important aspect of the House 's work ? its rapidly developing judicial function through its hearings of writs of error , which reached an unprecedented level of activity in the years immediately after the civil war . So important had this part of the Lords ' work become that during the discussions that preceded the House 's abolition it was seriously proposed that it be retained as a court of appeal . But although Firth may have presented the decline of the House of Lords as a smoother , more seamless process than it actually was , he was surely right about the institution 's declining political effectiveness . It is difficult to point to a single occasion during or after the civil war in which the initiative of the Lords on a major matter of policy was decisive , or in which they did more than obstruct and delay the implementation of decisions taken elsewhere. ? // Firth 's argument may seem less convincing , though , if we shift our gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual peers who were its members . Some of them still had enormous territorial power , which could help to shape the political and religious character of a whole county . The Earls of Derby in Lancashire on the royalist side , the Earl of Warwick in Essex and , to a lesser extent , Lord Brooke in Warwickshire on the parliamentarian one , spring immediately to mind . In some counties the rivalry of great aristocratic families ? of the Hastings and the Greys in Leicestershire , for example ? profoundly affected the course of events . Such noblemen , like the wealthy knights and gentlemen who were only a little below them in status , often raised men and money in huge quantites for the side they had espoused . The Earl of Essex had great influence in Staffordshire and the neighbouring counties , and as Lord General of the Parliament 's armies he was a figure of towering stature . His funeral in 1646 was conducted with the majestic pomp normally reserved for royalty . " Many of the peers still had significant electoral influence , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the Protectorate parliaments . Essex 's interest in Herefordshire temporarily survived him ? the Harleys made use of it during the recruiter elections . The royalist peers had forfeited their remaining electoral influence , but parliamentarian lords like the Earls of Pembroke and Salisbury in the southern counties , the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Wharton in the north , could still get their clients elected.t6 A few of the peers were also major players in parliamentary politics : Lord Saye is an obvious example . In 1647 he was certainly one of the leaders ( though only onethe others were all commoners ) of what for want of a better term we are still entitled to call the middle group ' . ' But although individual peers may have retained effective power and prestige , we should not ignore the signs of more general decline , which had deeper roots than the political setbacks of the 164os . Whatever may be our views about the pre-war difficulties described in Lawrence Stone 's classic Crisis of the Aristocracy , there can be no denying the fact that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somerset the Seymours still had lands and clients , and by Charles I 's reign there was also a resident peer in the county , the newly ennobled Lord Poulett . But real power was dispersed among an oligarchy of more than a dozen governing families . When Poulett tried to compete for county pre-eminence Sir Robert Phelips ran rings round him . ' $ In Dorset the Digbys , Earls of Bristol , were recent arrivals and their influence was at // first no greater than that of several of the leading gentry , while the Lords-Lieutenant , the Earls of Suffolk , were usually non-resident . The second Earl was building up an interest in the county in the 162os and ' 3os , but he died before the job was finished . So here too a gentry oligarchy , among whom Erle and Strangways were the most prominent , ran things without much interference . The most that can be said is that Sir John found the Digbys useful allies , just as he did other county magnates . Recent studies of other counties in this period ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same story.19 The influence of individual lords , though real , should not be exaggerated . I am not convinced , for example , that it required the superior intellect of a peer to draft the Heads of the Proposals . An I should not want to make too much of statements like Lord Conway 's description of the Earl of Holland in 164o as the invisible head of the Puritan parry ' . If Conway was right , Holland was extremely clever in protecting his invisibility , because nobody outside the Court seems to have noticed it . The context of Conway 's statement , however , clearly shows that he was talking only about Holland 's leadership of a Court cabal ' to which the puritan label had rightly or wrongly been attached . It is true , of course , that Holland had puritan sympathies , and as Chancellor of Cambridge took it upon himself to protect some of the godly ministers of that university . When John Stoughton was summoned before High Commission in 1635 he was soon let go and , John Rous reports , returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . His brother Warwick might have had better claims to leadership of a national faction , as Conway 's letter perhaps implies , but the supposition that the Puritans ' or the Puritan party ' had any single leader is really not very plausible . " We should be equally cautious about drawing conclusions from patron ? client relationships among the laity . If we look in the House of Commons for the clients of noblemen we can easily find a few who were clients and nothing else : Michael Oldisworth , secretary to the Earl of Pembroke , or Hugh Potter , servant to the Earl of Northumberland , for example . But this kind of one-dimensional dependency is unusual . The more typical clients were men like Robert Scawen , who was also in Northumberland 's service , but had a career of his own ? and an important one when he was chairman of the Army Committee ? in which he did much more than parrot the opinions of his employer . There were very few Hugh Potters ? total , one-hundred-per-cent , rubber-stamping clients ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Restoration is a sufficient reminder that people who started out as dependants , // as Pepys did of Edward Mountagu , might in the end carve out careers of their own . We should also be careful not to assume that just because a peer or other great man used his electoral influence on behalf of a particular candidate , that person automatically became his client . Lord Wharton may have used his influence on behalf of Henry Ireton in the recruiter election for Appleby , but Ireton was soon to be one of the organizers of Pride 's Purge , which Wharton certainly opposed . " The Dorset parliamentarian , John Fitzjames , is another whose electoral experiences suggest that we always need to be suitably cautious before we draw too many facile conclusions about patron ? client connections . Fitzjames was a client of the Earl of Salisbury , whom he served as Overseer of Cranborne Chase . However , when he was angling for a parliamentary seat at Shaftesbury , a borough in which Salisbury had some influence , the connection did him no good , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a candidate . Hussey also had the support of the Earl of Pembroke , who as lord of the manor had even more influence in Shaftesbury than Salisbury , so if patronage was the critical factor , his election ought to have been assured . Alas , the town elected a third candidate , a local parliamentarian gentleman named George Starre . " Besides trying to use Salisbury 's electoral influence , Fitzjames also sought the help of less exalted people . When he was negotiating for his arrears of pay , and for other debts owed him by the state , the people he turned to were not peers , but the MPs Denis Bond and Thomas Erle , Sir Walter 's son . Erie had promised Fitzjames to have a care of him ; either with a Army commission or in some other capacity , and Fitzjames relied on these noble promises ' . Erle , who was well connected both through his father and his father-in-law , Lord Saye , looked after Fitzjames 's interests at Westminster and supported him in the Shaftesbury election , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that the younger Erie was more interested in local than in national influence , reporting that he seldom attended the House , but followed his business in the Country , where he was a great Committeeman , helping himself and friends ' .24 After 1646 Fitzjames 's dependency on the Earl of Salisbury became less apparent . He made his alliances as it suited him ? with his old friends in Massey 's brigade during the Army ? Parliament conflict in 1647 , with Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper in the 1656 election , and with the Protector 's chief newswriter , Marchamont Nedham , whom he supplied with local news for Mercurius Politicus , a few years later . " // Attempts to portray the parliamentarians as an old-fashioned baronial faction are thus not very convincing.26 If we are searching for the survival of aristocratic power during the civil war , the place to look is in the King 's camp , where the likes of Newcastle , Hertford , and Bristol continued to exercise their talents . Even on the royalist side their leadership was being challenged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their friends . On the Parliament 's side , although individual peers retained a good deal of influence ? Essex , Brooke , Warwick , and Manchester during the war , Saye down to 1648 in alliance with other leaders of the middle group ? they were far from being the only leaders of the parliamentary cause . In 1649 , with Parliament purged , the King executed , and the middle group in ruins , even Lord Saye fled the scene ; in the words of a 1659 ballad , stolen away to Lundy , his island fastness in the Bristol Channel ! ' There was another , albeit temporary , shift in the balance of power within the political nation during the revolution . The civil war led to a significant decline in the authority of the gentry as a class , through the exclusion of the royalists from the commissions of the peace and other local offices , and the voluntary withdrawal of many neutrals and moderate parliamentarians . The undermining of traditional local institutions like quarter sessions by the new county committees also encouraged an influx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had hitherto been a level of government reserved for the upper gentry . Even after the dismantling of the committees in 1650 , the newcomers were still prominent in the militia and other local commissions , and by now they had gained a foothold in the revived commissions of the peace . Alan Everitt has argued that the failure of the republican regimes to put down durable roots was the result of the almost unanimous opposition of the traditional rulers of the shires . It has generally been accepted that the lesser men who filled their places lacked the authority to make county government work efficiently , and were fatally tarred with the brush of centralization , being perceived as agents of an unpopular national state.2$ Legitimate questions have been raised about the extent to which the Interregnum regimes were in fact more hostile to local interests than earlier ones , as well as about the conventional equation of localism with political moderation . But it can not be disputed that the revolution did lead to a displacement of the old magnate families in most English counties . Although representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government during the latter part of the Protectorate , // this was only possible when members of the older generation had been replaced by sons who were too young to have fought for the King.29 Among the moderate parliamentarians , the leading families went out in stages . In some places they were kicked out of the county committee soon after the war , but managed to hold on as JPs until the purges of 1648-9 . In others there was little change in the composition of the governing elite until well into the 165os , the same families controlling both the county committee and the commissions of the peace . In some places the fragmentation of the parliamentarian cause led to repeated purges : of Presbyterians by Independents ; of Commonwealth-men by Cromwellians ; of Cromwellians by Good Old Cause ' republicans . We ought not to exaggerate the extent to which local government was politicized ? there were plenty of neutrals and opportunists , as well as genuine localists , everywhere . But whenever there was a shift in the national balance of power it was eventually reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by another . Some of those newcomers certainly did come from lower down the social scale , and it was to protect himself from such people that Fitzjames sought a seat in Parliament : to keep myself from being trampled upon by such kind of things as the spirit of a gentleman can never brook ' , he told his father-in-law . ' ' One obvious result of the revolution was that no one could pretend any longer that there was a unified political culture to which everyone , deep down , subscribed , or that disagreements were merely the result of unfortunate misunderstandings . In the early months of 164.1 there were many who , like Edward Pitt in Hampshire , could still utter the conventional platitudes of consensus politics . Pitt rejoiced that the Long Parliament had been summoned , for the better ordering of the affairs both of the church and state , whereof we have of late so much complained ' . Parliament , he reminded the county 's subsidy commissioners , was the ancient and laudable way that hath ever made the kingdom ... happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp might wish to preserve the old community harmony , they were inexorably driven into taking sides , and even those who managed to avoid doing so had only to look around them to see the lamentable results of strife and division . Moderates might maintain old friendships across the political divide ? the correspondence between Sir Roger Burgoyne and Sir Ralph Verney provides a striking example ? but although they might deplore the intolerance that surrounded them , they could not escape it .
