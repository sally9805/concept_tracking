THAT FIRST TIME , it was noon recess at school . A blowy autumn day . I was sitting on a bench in the playground with two other fifth-grade girls , eating our lunches out of paper bags , and this man appeared and stood watching us from about ten feet away . There was a rusted old chain-link fence at the edge of the playground , but you could slip through it ; the man must 've come in that way . Tall and dark-haired , a stylish-looking sport coat and a dark blue shirt open at the throat , aviator sunglasses so greeny-dark his eyes were hidden . He was so handsome Standing there , like he 'd been watching us for some . time , and smiling . When I looked up he said , " Ingrid ? Hey : Ingrid Boone . " His smile widened . I stared at him and I knew who he was though I had not seen him in a long time . My heart stopped and when it started again I was on my feet , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his and we were walking fast to his car parked at the edge of the playground , the motor running . <p> I whispered , " Daddy ? Daddy ? " squinting up at him so hard it hurt , and Daddy said , a finger to his lips , " Uncle Jack , let 's say . Uncle Jack Boone , baby . " <p> Five times in all , October through November 1977 when I was ten years old and Momma and I were living in a rented house in Tintern Falls , Daddy came to see me in secret . Just that once at noon ; it was too risky at noon . The other times he 'd be waiting for me after school in his rented car . Driving out along the river into the hills north of town , we 'd be parallel with the Chautauqua &; Buffalo train tracks elevated above the river on a wooden trestle until they disappeared into the tunnel at Block Hill . That tunnel  --  a gouged-out hole like a nightmare in the side of the earth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole only a short distance , then ceased as if the darkness was an actual substance , a barrier that could stop it . I 'm dreaming of it all these years . <p> I was excited and scared believing that Daddy would drive us both away , we 'd fly away and be hidden together , but each drive came to an end . Daddy crossed the river at Milburn , or Flemingville , or Shaheen . Back in Tintern Falls he 'd let me off a half-mile from the clapboard house on North End Avenue where Momma and I lived , not needing to ask me , the first day , where it was . <p> Saying , " Walk straight home now , baby . And do n't look back . " <p> Every time I looked back , from the house 's front walk , Daddy 's car would be gone . <p> Daddy warned me not to tell Momma , this was our secret and if I told he might have to go away again and I would never see him again . <p> I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same person sometimes and she did know my secrets but not this one . I told Daddy I would die before I told anybody and Daddy laughed and said that was n't necessary but it was flattering to hear . <p> Momma took pride dressing up in high heels , stockings , floral-print dresses she 'd sewed herself or filmy blouses and tight straight skirts ; Momma owned a dozen belts of leather , linked metal , shiny plastic to show off her slim waist where she worked as " receptionist " at Zink 's Real Estate &; Home Insurance on Front Street , downtown . Sometimes she did n't get home till after 6:00 P.M. weekdays . There were times even later on Friday . Or I 'd look out the living room window past the scrawny bamboo growing wild in the front yard and Momma would be sitting with Mr. Zink in his lime green Oldsmobile at the curb , the two of them talking , laughing or frowning or arguing with the earnestness of men and women on TV you watch in close-up who ca n't see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from school Momma would n't know , and whatever she 'd ask me I would reply as Daddy instructed , as if Daddy had n't ever been in town . I 'm the invisible man , Daddy said , kissing my forehead . I 'm just passing through . <p> Daddy spoke of Florida  --  Tampa , Miami , Key West . The Gulf of Mexico . He was a freelance pilot now ; he made good money flying light cargo and sometimes passengers in the Caribbean . Journeys by night , squalls and thunderstorms . A forced landing once on a mile-long nameless island west of Jamaica . Daddy 's southernmost destinations were Caracas , Venezuela , and Bogota , Colombia . He spread out badly wrinkled maps to show me , but the maps were discontinuous and I had no idea how far away these places were from Tintern Falls , New York . A long , long way , Daddy said , touching the tip of his finger to my nose . Much of it over shark-infested waters . <p> Another thing Daddy would say mysteriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there 's nowhere in the human world you ca n't fly to if you 've got enough fuel in your tank . <p> Daddy 's wallet was like no other wallet I 'd ever seen  --  made of crocodile hide , in shiny patches . There was a look of pride to it , so thick with bills it could n't be snapped shut . <p> A one-dollar bill Daddy gave me , slipping it into my pocket . Another time a five-dollar bill . Warning me not to spend it so anyone would be suspicious . Above all it was to be a secret from Momma  --  OK ? <p> Snapshots Daddy carried in that wallet , years old and beginning to tear . Laying them out carefully like playing cards , like a game of solitaire , on the picnic table behind the Tastee-Freez . I was spooning chocolate ice cream into my mouth , and the spooning slowed as I stared at the snapshots . " Who 's that " I snorted with derision , pointing at a little girl about two years old with filmy blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that made them look like cat 's eyes , or something radioactive . " That 's you , " Daddy said , annoyed . " Who else 's beautiful baby girl am I gon na carry in my wallet , except my own ? " There was a snapshot of Momma , so young and beautiful in cutoff jeans and a red halter top , holding a baby up beside her face ; I stared and stared , jealous of that baby And Momma and Daddy so young in some time I did n't know long ago , arms linked tight around each other 's waist , good-looking and arrogant , preening themselves for the camera  --  they might 've been certain of the young people my eyes snagged on in Tintern Falls and followed in the street . <p> Daddy tapped that snapshot with his finger , the nail of which was blackened from some injury . " Here 's the start of it , " he said , smiling hard . " That ca n't be erased . " <p> I liked best a picture of Daddy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cap cocked on her head and me , Ingrid , about seven years old , the three of us looking like a family you might recognize as such . We were standing in front of the Waco with the glitzy gold-painted wings at the Marsena airfield . I remembered that sporty airplane I had n't seen for years and I started to cry and Daddy looked sad and told me not to cry , baby , it was going to be OK . <p> Daddy 's dark brown hair was cut shorter now . There were vertical dents in his cheeks like lines made with a ruler . He was two or three days unshaven . Tears came into his eyes easily ; he 'd wipe them away with the edge of his hand . In a paper bag in his coat pocket there was a pint bottle of whiskey he 'd take a small , quick swallow from then replace like it was n't there . Still , he dressed well ; he was a good-looking man , and he carried himself with pride . You could see he'd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd worn a uniform . I noticed how men 's eyes lighted on him hoping they knew him , he 'd call out hello and slap their arms . Women 's eyes trailed after him . At the Tastee-Freez the woman at the screened counter smiled at Daddy , flirting , trying to start a conversation , her gaze running over him like warm water and spilling onto me . Saying , " I love your little girl 's hair , wish mine was that color " and Daddy said , " Thanks , this is my little niece , " and the woman said , " Uh  --  d' you live around here , mister ? " and Daddy said , politely , backing off , " Fact is I do n't , ma'am , sorry , " and the woman persisted , raising her voice to call after , " I was just trying to decide if you looked sort of familiar or not , " and Daddy laughed and said , " Maybe you 've been seeing me in your dreams ? " <p> This was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls Elementary School there were cousins of mine bused in from the country that Momma warned me not to mix with any more than I needed . Blood kin of mine , not hers  --  they were Boones . <p> The oldest was Mary Ellen Boone in sixth grade . A fat-faced girl with mean eyes . She 'd watch me at recess and after school and one day brushed against me , bumped me on the playground and said , in a low voice , like this was something her mother had warned her against , too , " Your daddy is a wanted man , your daddy is in trouble with the law " I stared at her in astonishment , and she said it again in a louder , thrilled voice , " Your daddy is a wanted man Your daddy is in trouble with the law He 's gon na go to jail if they catch him " I said , " You 're a liar " and she said , " You 're a liar " I shoved her , and she shoved me back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I punched her on the shoulder and she punched me in the face and kids were gathered around us laughing and yelling . I backed off and ran away , furious , my face hot with tears . <p> If I could open a vein . Not to inject any shit , I will never weaken like that again , but just to feel the kick of it , the old memory . So the numbness lifts . So I could get back there easier . <p> Tell me of your life , you said . <p> Here are facts : In that fall of 1977 , when he returned to Eden County as a wanted man , Lucas Boone was thirty-three years old . Chloe Boone , who was still his wife though they had not lived together for almost five years , was thirty . They 'd been married in 1966 in the little country town of Shaheen in a Lutheran church where Chloe 's family  --  the McDiarmids  --  went , though neither Lucas nor Chloe was a churchgoer . They 'd had a baby boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and was buried in the Lutheran cemetery in Shaheen , and they 'd had a baby girl who lived whose name was Ingrid who was me born December 11 , 1967 , in Port Oriskany . <p> In June 1968 Lucas Boone , aged twenty-four , joined the Navy to serve in the Vietnam War , and he was Airman First Class Boone when he was honorably discharged in January 1971 . When he returned home he and his wife and daughter lived for a while in Port Oriskany , and in Shaheen , and in the countryside near Marsena . Details of his employment during this period are vague . He flew part-time for Mohawk Air in the Great Lakes region , he worked in the Allis-Chalmers plant in Port Oriskany . In August 1977 a warrant was issued by the Port Oriskany police for his arrest : he was one of several men wanted for questioning in the shooting death of a drug dealer . In time the other men were arrested and questioned , and all but one wound up in Red Bank State Prison for Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone 's named Vaughn Brownlee who was shot dead by an unknown perpetrator or perpetrators in Port Oriskany in September 1974 . Lucas Boone , who 'd disappeared immediately after the shooting of the drug dealer , had never been located by police , never arrested . <p> These are facts ( except for the date of my birthday ) that I did n't know in fall 1977 . Children know nothing factual about their parents or about their own lives ; it 's a forbidden knowledge . <p> The very word parents  --  that was n't a word I would have used . <p> Such words as husband , wife  --  man , woman  --  male , female  --  even my father , my mother  --  would have been awkward on my tongue . <p> Facts are the last things you know about your family . By the time you know , it 's already too late . <p> Like a small plane in bad weather circling a field to land but fearful of coming in so at the last minute nosing up , regaining altitude and recircling , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronting it head-on . Smoking his Camels , uncapping and sipping from his pint of Four Roses . Smell of smoke in the car 's interior , sweet-sickish smell of whiskey . Daddy 's oiled hair . And a new suede jacket he 'd just bought himself , now the weather was turning cold , had n't brought many clothes up from Florida with him  --  that smell of suede , rich red-brown of a deer 's summer coat . My nostrils widened , greedy and hopeful . <p> How many times saying , as if he was arguing , pleading his case , with someone not present , " You know I love you , Ingrid , do n't you ?  --  been missing you , and your Momma , like crazy . " And , " Hope you forgive your Dad being away so long ? " He 'd run his hairy-knuckled fingers over his face , digging at his eyes like he wanted to tear away some sight or memory . Saying , in an undertone , " It is n't like I had much choice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shy , eager . Yes Daddy . <p> The answer that 's required . The only answer . <p> Bringing quick , easy tears into the man 's eyes , bloodshot , worried eyes . That spark like a match flaring up . <p> So he 'd say next he 'd make it up to me someday  --  " You and your Momma both . " <p> He 'd say , exhaling smoke like it was poison , angry-eager to get it out of his lungs , " In the meantime this is our secret , baby . Just you and me . Right ? " <p> Secrets have always been easy for me , it 's the opposite of secrets that is hard . <p> Till one November afternoon , parked in the car , Ford compact <p> dull dishwater brown to attract no one 's suspicious eye , we were off the highway north of Tintern Falls above the river that was coarse and choppy in the wind , and the sky like an enamel table that 's been scratched and the dark underside 's showing through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at a locomotive and freight cars ( I counted thirty-two )  --  CHAUTAUQUA &; BUFFALO , BALTIMORE &; OHIO , NEW YORK CENTRAL  --  thunder past on the wooden trestle that did n't look substantial enough to support them and disappear into the tunnel in Block Hill like a snake disappearing into a hole and the deafening-rattling noise of the freight cars too was sucked away with such suddenness it was like there had never been any train , any noise , at all . That 's how you die : are gone . That fast . <p> It was n't my thought but Daddy 's . I heard it as if he 'd spoken it aloud . <p> And suddenly Daddy said , " This Zink . This friend of your Momma 's . Tell me about him . " <p> It should have been a surprise to me that Daddy knew about Mr. Zink . But I understood he would know , like he 'd known where we lived without asking , and where I went to school . <p> I said , " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , eh ? He 's got some family somewhere , eh ? " <p> This I did n't know , this left me blank . Staring down at my hands in my lap that wanted to twist , writhe like something trapped . <p> Daddy uncapped the bottle of Four Roses and seemed to be weighing it in his hand before taking a quick swallow . Not looking at me , like his questions shamed him . " Your Momma  --  she likes Zink , eh ? " he asked , and I shrugged and murmured I guessed so , and he asked , " Does this guy pay for the house ? Does he own the house ? " and I said I did n't know , such a question was a surprise to me . Daddy asked , " Does he bring you things ? - presents ? " and I nodded yes , and he asked , " What ? What 's he bring you ? " and I told him a doll I hated , a record player , a game called Sorry , angora mittens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Momma , what 's he bring her ? " and I said , stammering what came into my head , a TV , a toaster , a pair of leather boots , helped pay for the car and going to the dentist , and again my voice faltered so Daddy broke in , " He comes over a lot , eh ? How many times a week ? " and I stared at my hands in my lap , I could n't stop my fingernails from digging against my thumbnails where the quicks were already scabby , I shook my head I did n't know , and Daddy asked , " Once ? Twice ? Three times ? Every fucking night ? " and I shook my head I did n't know , and Daddy asked , " Does he stay the night , sometimes ? " and again I shook my head , and Daddy asked , in this patient voice you 'd use to speak to a dumb little kid , " Look : is he there in the mornings sometimes ?  --  Maynard Zink " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daddy angry , Daddy reaching out and shoving Momma , and Momma screaming . I stammered and said no , did n't think so  --  no . Daddy took a swallow of his whiskey and was quiet for a minute , then said , in a careful voice , looking at me , " Baby , either Zink is there , in that place you live , in the mornings sometimes , or he is n't . You 'd know , right ?  --  unless you were blind and deaf . " <p> Not Mr. Zink but some other men sometimes  --  younger men , men more Momma 's age , one of them named Randy with his hair in a ponytail who was a bartender in town and rode a motorcycle and called me Toots I specially liked  --  these men might stay the night with Momma sometimes . But not Mr. Zink . <p> Shook my head trying not to cry , the angry sound of Daddy 's voice and the jeering in it , like the jeering of the older boys at school for any of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped . <p> Daddy muttered , " OK , baby . What you do n't know , you do n't know . " He drained the last drop of the whiskey and lowered the car window and tossed the bottle down the embankment into the water and said like he was making a decision , or had already made it , " All it comes down to in life , Ingrid , a man wants to do the right thing . I want to be a good man . " He paused and rubbed again at his eyes . " I know I made mistakes , I made a wrong turn . It is n't in my heart , or in my nature , y'know  --  like a scorpion has a nature ?  --  a copperhead snake ?  --  to be a good man . But I think I can go against my nature . Do you think that 's possible , Ingrid ? " <p> I said I did n't know . I was nervous and scared , and now one of my hands was loose , my fingers jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arguing with somebody not visible , " I want to be a decent person . I 've got a chance now , I 've got money saved and I can begin again . It 's just that I ca n't see any good reason not to be a bastard . I was trained young , and the training took . Blowing off guys ' heads  --  it settles any doubts you have about them , or them about you . And like I say , it 's my nature . " <p> I asked , scared , " You are n't going to blow off Mr. Zink 's head , are you , Daddy ? " <p> Daddy squinted at me and laughed , turning down one side of his mouth like he 'd done with the flirty woman at the Tastee-Freez . " You think I should , baby ? " <p> And even then I think now he did n't know what he intended to do . Why he 'd come back , what he wanted . I 'd believed he had a plan from the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was a child and could not have understood how even adults , even my father Lucas Boone , might be walking through their lives not knowing where ' they were going and what they wanted or even told themselves they wanted as in a story with a destination . It was more like Daddy was a man playing solitaire , slapping down the cards to see how they fell , how the game shaped up . You could always sweep the cards away , or you could continue playing and win . If Daddy had a map of the possibilities before him in his head , it was a map of mostly emptiness . Like the turquoise sea called Caribbean . <p> That map that 's torn and folded a thousand times , that map I stole from him . <p> It was so . Maynard Zink who was Momma 's employer , her boss she called him , teasing , to his face , dropped by our house on North End Avenue two , three times a week . Never weekends . Momma sometimes invited him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he 'd never expected such a thing . " Are you sure , Chloe ? " he 'd ask , rubbing at his mustache . " You 've got room for a big lug like me ? " <p> The kind of man who , every time he steps through a doorway , he 's squinting , anxious , to see if he 's welcome . Even when the doorway is his own . <p> Momma spoke of Mr. Zink as the kindest man she knew . Saying to her women friends he was a sweetheart , not a stingy bone in his body . How it was between him and his wife she did n't know and did n't want to know , that was n't her business . Sure , Maynard Zink was a bit of a fool , but that 's the only kind of man you can trust . Saying , " Christ knows , I 've had enough of the other kind . " <p> Piggy-Zink I called him in secret . Though I liked him , I liked him because he liked me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I spoke , answering his questions that were polite but also sincere . He was a tall , slope-shouldered man many years older than Momma but not so old , Momma liked to say , as he appeared . That kind of fair , thin , wind- or sunburnt-looking skin that flushes easily . His belly was the size of a honeydew melon balanced above his belt . His faded yellow hair was combed in thin , separated strands across his forehead , and his eyes were shrewd and damp and eager and mournful all at once . Some nights Momma or I might see him driving past the house , slow and cruising in his green Olds , and we 'd laugh at him ; other nights we 'd feel sorry for him , and Momma would send me out onto the porch to wave him inside . You would n't know , Momma said , Maynard Zink had the money he had . <p> Crazy for Chloe Boone . So he 'd take all kinds of shit . <p> I 'd hear them talking quietly , laughing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be asleep . The clink of bottles , glasses . Mr. Zink liked to eat , and he liked to drink  --  bringing six-packs of ale , gallon bottles of Chianti , his favorite Kentucky bourbon . Sometimes they did quarrel , it 's true . Or Momma spoke sharply or . dismissively to Mr. Zink , and Mr. Zink grunted and laughed a little like a boxer taking a blow to the gut . That big a man , big-bellied lug , he could absorb a woman 's punches , could n't he ? And beg for more ? <p> One night I woke hearing what sounded like Momma sobbing . Unless she was laughing . A drunk-shrieky sound , then whispering and silence . Not in the living room , the lights were out when I checked , but next door in her bedroom . Piggy-Zink He 's in there . There was no light beneath Momma 's door , so they were in there in the dark . I heard the bedsprings , and more whispering ; We 'd only been living in the clapboard house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Zink called it , but already I was waiting for Daddy to come through the front door . He 'd land his plane in a field nearby and he 'd come to the house and he would n't knock , he would n't open the door as you open a door ; it would fly open before him , shattering . There would be his fierce , angry eyes , and his fists . There would be his gun . <p> A tickle between my legs in that soft , secret silver of flesh between my legs I had no name for , sharp and sudden . Remembering that gun that fitted in my Daddy 's hand . That , other times , I forgot . <p> That night Daddy did come to the house . Momma opened the door , and there he was . The two of them staring at each other while Maynard Zink in the living room , in his undershirt , called out , " Who is it , Chloe ?  --  anything wrong ? " <p> It was just past 11:00 P.M. I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I work terrified hearing their voices , raised and excited . <p> I ran to see , and Momma was trying to pull the men apart . It happened that fast . Momma barefoot in jeans and a tight black rib-hugger sweater , looking like a high school girl except her face was dead white and her mouth red like something pasted on her skin . She was crying , " Luke My God , Luke No  --  " and Daddy was saying , " I 'm here to speak with my wife alone , " leaning his face toward Mr. Zink 's , " you got that , mister ? Get out of here " and Mr. Zink scared and clumsy like a man in a dream , not knowing what 's happening except it 's happening too fast for him to comprehend , saying , " See here See here "  --  and Daddy shoved Mr. Zink with the flat of his hand , and Mr. Zink stumbled against a table and a lamp overturned and Momma screamed , but Mr. Zink did n't fall , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him from falling . Mr. Zink wheeled upon him , a strand of hair loose across his forehead and his big face flushed , his mouth pursed like a baby 's , Mr. Zink flailed with his fists but landed no blows because Daddy slipped them snakelike and agile and laughing . Daddy was wearing his new suede jacket , and his dark , oiled hair gleamed ; he was smiling , angry but smiling , no dark glasses now so his face looked rawer and more exposed and you could tell he 'd been drinking , there was that heated flush to his cheeks . " I said , I 'm here to speak with my wife , asshole , so get out , " Daddy said . Mr. Zink was puffing , teetering on his clumsy legs . I was ashamed of him , embarrassed , his melon-belly so prominent in his undershirt , his flashy checked trousers riding low on his hips like a young guy 's , except Mr. Zink was n't young . He stood taller than Daddy but slope-shouldered , his fatty chest rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quick and purposeful as an upright snake . Daddy said , contemptuously , " Out Out of here before you get hurt , Zink Think I do n't know you , I know you , Zink Bastard Cocksucker Taking advantage of another man 's wife because she needs money , Zink Think I do n't know you " and Mr. Zink was mumbling , panting , " See here  --  just a minute  --  I do n't care who you are , m-mister You have no right "  --  and Daddy pushed at him , backing him up , and Momma pulled at Daddy 's arm , pleading , begging like I had n't seen her in years . Remembering now : Momma pleading with Daddy , Daddy a force like flame , a column of fire , dangerous just to touch , ready to flash , to strike , in any direction . Daddy did n't push Momma aside ; he was gentle with her even as she slapped at him , screamed and wept , calling his name . He was n't even looking at her , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man only looks at another man in such a situation , and he was looking at Mr. Zink , contemplating what to do . This middle-aged paunchy fool who would n't back down from Lucas Boone Like Maynard Zink did n't even know who Lucas Boone was . <p> Then something shone in Daddy 's face . He leaned in and punched the other man in the face in short , stinging jabs , not hard , as if to demonstrate what he could do , what Mr. Zink , wheezing and puffing , now dripping blood from his nose down onto his undershirt , could n't prevent him from doing . Momma gave a sharp , hurt cry at the sight of the blood . " Luke , no Please , Luke  --  let him go " and Daddy said , in almost a level , normal voice , " The bastard can go , Chloe , anytime he wants to . " But Mr. Zink did n't back down from Daddy  --  that was the strange , the unexpected thing . You wanted to scream at him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push himself at Daddy , so many years older than Daddy and so badly out of condition , his eyes popping in their sockets , a big vein like a worm throbbing in his forehead . He was muttering , " God damn you , mister You ca n't just do these things You bastard " Daddy hid his surprise , saying , " C'm on , shithead Think you can do it , eh ? " now teasing Mr. Zink , lowering his fists so that the older man could hit him if he could catch him , but Daddy was too quick , leaping to the side , ducking and dancing backward , and Mr. Zink , wild-eyed , swung his big balled fists , first the right then the left , missing Daddy , then stumbling in pursuit of him and , almost falling into him , striking a clumsy blow on Daddy 's raised forearm . Daddy was saying , teasing , " Maynard Zink Fucking another man 's wife Think you can do it , eh ? " Daddy leaned his face toward Mr. Zink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye ; Daddy laughed , steeling himself to be hit , goading his opponent into hitting him . There was a flurry of ill-coordinated blows , but Daddy did n't flinch or back away , though now his face too was shiny with blood and Momma was pushing Mr. Zink away , sobbing , " Stop it Maynard God damn you " Still Daddy kept it up , taunting Mr. Zink , " Maynard Fuckface Cocksucker She 's my wife and this shit with you it 's just for what she can get out of you , asshole "  --  laughing now , grunting and laughing as he presented himself to Mr. Zink , who punched at his chest , his stomach , wincing as he struck Daddy 's belt buckle with his bare fist . Momma slapped at Mr. Zink , screaming , " I said stop Stop You 're crazy as he is I hate you " <p> The men ceased . Like baffled animals , breathing hard , unable to catch their breath , their chests rising and falling . Their faces were slick with blood , perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his stained undershirt , the white elastic band of his undershorts showing above the waist of his trousers , his right . eye beginning to swell , looked like an old man , dazed , ravaged , swaying on his feet on the verge of collapse . Daddy , holding himself erect and arrogant as a fighting cock , was panting too , swiping at his bleeding eye as if he did n't know what had happened ; he too was dazed , his face reddened from the blows he 'd absorbed . And Momma sobbing as if her heart was breaking  --  backing off from him when he reached to her . <p> The living room that had been so cozy , this room Momma and I had loved , was a shambles . The glass-topped table overturned , the sea-green ceramic lamp broken , a half-dozen ale bottles and glasses on the floor , ale spilled and pungent-smelling soaking into the carpet , the rust-colored shag carpet Momma and I had bought at a discount score in town , like pools of urine . There were bright red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even on the nearest wall . On a farther wall Momma had hung a mirror framed in black-lacquered wood in a style meant to be Oriental , and this mirror was crooked and seemed to be reflecting a crooked , drunken scene . I stood in the doorway in my pajamas , blinking , not knowing what I saw but feeling that unmistakable aftermath of a fight , that thrill , that wild thrum in the nerves , the pulse that 's still in the air , agitating the air like ripples in water . Like that heavy , sweet-pounding blood-beat after you 've come , somebody has made you come , and you did n't know what it was or how badly you wanted it until now . <p> Then Momma turned and saw me at last . Murmuring " Ingrid "  --  her eyes swollen and brimming with tears  --  and she came to me and hugged me so tight it hurt and both of us trembling and I was n't crying , I was terrified but I was n't crying . Because this had happened before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen again , and no one could stop it nor would wish to stop it despite the words that are uttered , the guilty eyes , the shame . Momma was framing my face in her hands , my face that was feverish : " Honey , go back to your room , will you ? It 's all right , honey , nobody 's hurt , nobody 's going to hurt you , but you should n't be here , you should n't be up so late seeing such things . " <p> And Daddy said , angry , like he was ashamed , " Do like your Momma says , Ingrid . " <p> Momma pushed me toward the door , and I retreated into the shadowy hall , and I heard Momma say , " Oh my God . This is what I deserve , is n't it . This is what I deserve . " <p> But already Daddy was speaking with Mr. Zink again . It was as if a veil had been drawn over me and I was invisible ; they forgot me at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Zink Got it ? She 's my wife you 've been fucking , and it 's over now , so get out of here " and Mr. Zink , fumbling to wipe his face with a wadded tissue , dropping the tissue and unable to retrieve it , stared blinking at Momma , and for a long moment his mouth worked , he could n't speak , then he said in a weak , plaintive voice , " Chloe ? Dear ? Is it so ? You want me to leave ? " and Momma said , " Yes . Please . You 'd better , Maynard . He 'll hurt you if you do n't , " and Mr. Zink said , " Should we call the police ? Chloe ? " and Momma said quickly , " No Not the police . Just leave , please , " and Mr. Zink said , groping toward her , blinking and baffled , " You want me to leave , Chloe ? Leave you and Ingrid here with this  --  madman ? " Trying to touch Momma 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repugnance , a gesture so quick and instinctive there was no mistaking what it meant , and Momma cried , " Yes Please For Christ 's sake go " but still Mr. Zink groped toward her like a blind man , his eyes bleary and bloodshot , he stammered , " Chloe ? You c-ca n't mean it This house  --  you promised  --  " and Momma turned on him now , furious , as if she was ashamed Daddy was a witness to this exchange , " Go away , I told you Do n't touch me You disgust me " and Mr. Zink stood swaying , staring at her , and I saw in his face the look I 'd seen that first time he 'd followed Momma in the street , drawn to the promise maybe of what was mean and pitiless in her , meanwhile Momma saying , " Luke is right . He 's always right . I 'm only here , with you , for what I can get out of you . That 's the only reason . If you were n't such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So it ended like that . Mr. Zink was panting like a wounded animal , but he took in these words , swallowed , and nodded , his gaze turning inward , almost meditative , bemused , as with a measure of dignity he stooped fatly to pick up his shirt and his coat where they 'd fallen to the floor , and as Momma and Daddy watched united in silence he walked out , not touching the front door that stood open  --  as if he was through with touching anything in this house , this bungalow he 'd provided for Momma and me , ever again . And then he was in his car , and we heard the motor gunned a little too loud , and then he was driving away , he was gone . And Momma and Daddy had already forgotten him , standing still wordless , looking at each other . As if across a deep ravine they looked at each other . <p> Till finally Momma said , " So you 're not dead , after all . I 'd been wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face tenderly at the sink , then sat him in a chair , his suede jacket removed , his shirt open and head back so she could press ice cubes wrapped in towels against his swelling eye . As the towels soaked with blood she changed them . Her hands were trembling , and she was cursing under her breath Oh God Oh Luke but she remained calm , practical-fingered as a nurse . I helped her , breaking ice cubes out of the blue plastic trays from the freezer so excitedly and eagerly I cracked each tray ; they 'd never be good again . Momma was saying , " Oh Luke , you let that man hit you , hit your face , oh God I was scared you 'd kill him , " and Daddy said shrugging , but you could see he was pleased with himself , " Chloe , I 'm beyond that now . I 'm not like that now . " Out of an inside pocket of his blood-splattered jacket he 'd taken a handgun , and laid it on the kitchen table within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a revolver with a blunt snub nose . <p> We might have been waiting for the sound of a siren , for a sheriff 's car to swing up to the curb . Quick , purposeful footsteps up the walk , onto the front porch . From time to time Momma would murmur she did n't think Maynard Zink would call the police , he was n't the kind , it would reflect badly upon him , it would be goddamned embarrassing for him , and Daddy said he hoped she was right , shrugging and laughing and wincing because his face was more cut up , battered , than he 'd known , and maybe he was more wrung out , too , now the adrenaline rush had abated , his opponent was gone . I touched the gun with just my fingertips . So heavy , it did n't budge . <p> It was 11:30 P.M. , and then midnight . Rain was blown against the windows ; sometime it had started to rain , and we had n't noticed . Momma and Daddy were talking and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momma looked young and excitable as a girl , a girl whose actions you could n't predict any more than she could predict them herself . She 'd fall to kissing Daddy and running her hands over him , his chest , his muscled shoulders , then leaning away when he tried to grab her , wanting to kiss harder , as if I was n't there . But it was all right was there , so long past my bedtime ; Daddy grinned at me and hugged me in the crook of his arm and called me his darling girl , his baby Ingrid he was so crazy for God knows he 'd never leave again , did I forgive him ?  --  did Momma forgive him ? Momma said repeatedly , wiping her eyes , " Is n't this a surprise , Ingrid Is n't this a revelation "  --  the word " revelation " strange on her lips like some new , exotic word she 'd just learned and was fascinated to utter . " The ' madman ' has come back  --  for how long ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingrid to pack . I 've got plans . " <p> Seemingly it was a secret between Daddy and me that we 'd been together those five times without Momma knowing . And she would never know . <p> Not even years later , not even then would I tell . If secrets do n't bind together your life you have no life . <p> While Momma was tending to Daddy brisk and nurselike they 'd begun drinking of course . Bottles of ale out of the refrigerator , then Old Granddad Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey taken down from a high kitchen shelf . Daddy smacked his lips . " So this is what you drink now , Chloe ? " and Momma said sharply , " That 's right . Now , with you . " <p> The way Daddy then looked at Momma , who was leaning against the sink regarding him with her hurt , impassioned eyes  --  Daddy with his angry-looking bruised eye and cut face , the smile . draining from his lips  --  not even needing to touch each other . If a man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Daddy where we 'd be going , would we be flying in one of the planes he 'd taken us in years ago . I wanted to ask Daddy what it meant he was wanted , he was in trouble with the law . But the words choked in my throat . Daddy and Momma paid no attention to me ; their eyes were only for each other . <p> I wanted to ask about Mr. Zink . Piggy-Zink He 'd looked so comical staggering out the door , his nose bloodied and the bald crown of his head flushed . Would n't we ever see him again ? Would we have to leave this house ? Mr. Zink was a nice man , he 'd been nice to me . But  --  Piggy-Zink You had to laugh . <p> Momma pressed ice cubes against Daddy 's eye . What an ugly cut , diagonal through Daddy 's thick eyebrow , a sliver of flesh gouged out . He 'd have a nasty scar , Momma said . One he could n't hide . <p> Momma 's mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kissed off by Daddy . Her face showing the strain , And that way of talking , like walking on tiptoe , of someone who 's been drinking , trying to shape each word . She said , " Goddamn it , Luke . Just showing up like this . No warning , my heart almost stopped I did n't know if you were alive or dead , it 's been  --  how long ?  --  since you contacted me ? " <p> Daddy said teasing , " Honey , if I was dead , would n't you know it ? If I was gone forever from this world ? " <p> Momma said , bitter , " There 's been so many times I 've thought that was so . Waking at night from a dream of seeing you dead . It 's like I gave you up , not once but lots of times . And I 've been dead , too  --  but had to keep on living . " <p> " Looks like you been doing all right . You 're the kind of woman somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and lifted her glass to her mouth . By this time too they were both smoking , out of Daddy 's pack of Camels on the table . A book of matches , silver , stamped Marita 's , no name familiar to me . <p> " This big-boy lover Maynard Zink  --  who 's he ? " Daddy asked . When Momma would n't answer , pushing it , " He 's  --  what ? One of a kind , or  --  " And still Momma would n't answer , wincing . " Or just one of a series ? Huh ? " <p> Momma whispered , " Fuck you . " <p> Daddy laughed . " Hell , I 'm a changed man now , Chloe . You saw , just now . I can go against my nature . " <p> " It 's late for that , Luke . Is n't it ? " <p> Daddy spoke carefully , as if it pained him to speak . He looked at me without seeing me , his words were all for her . <p> Saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , Christ knows  --  water buffalo But I never saw their faces . None of it was real to me . The more it happened , strafing , dropping napalm on ' em , poor fuckers , the more it was n't real . And I was n't real . I was stoned most of the time , or strung out . Heroin was just like tobacco , that common . It was like rations . I never worried my plane would be shot down , it was like cartoons in the movies . Once you 're at a certain altitude . I knew I would n't die or if I did it did n't matter shit . A man is shit . So how can it matter ? " Daddy was speaking earnestly now , looking at Momma who was sitting across the table from him , elbows on the table , hair disheveled , half shielding her face , her gaze downcast like she was tired , so tired , all of us so tired , scared . " If I blew the head off a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends  --  including the cops  --  acknowledges that fact , you expect me to take it seriously ? You expect me to go to Red Bank for it ? Do n't make me laugh . I 'm shit in the eyes of God , so anything I do or have done or will do is n't important . " <p> Momma winced , saying , " You ca n't think that way , Luke . We 've been over this . That 's a wrong way of thinking . " <p> " It 's my way of thinking . " <p> " You can change . I 've changed . " <p> " You ? No you have n't . You 're still my girl , Chloe , and you 'll always be my girl . Wo n't she , Ingrid ? "  --  looking at me with a bright grin . " That does n't change . " <p> " I can go a day , a day and a night , without thinking of you . I 've done it . " <p> " Fuck you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Daddy said , raising his voice , " Any man you 're with , anytime , ever  --  you 're still my girl , and my wife . That wo n't change . " <p> " I 'm not a girl now . I 'm old . " <p> " You 're not thirty years old . " <p> " You ruined my life , and . you ruined your own . That makes us both old . " <p> " Like hell I ruined our lives , " Daddy said , hurt . " I did what I had to do , I do n't take shit from anybody . I do n't regret it . " <p> " Never mind about that . It makes me sick , I do n't want to hear it . " <p> " I 'm a man of pride . I 've got my pride . " <p> " Yes , that 's the trouble . That 's always been the trouble . " <p> " You saw me just now , with that asshole boyfriend  --  " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of yours . I could have hurt him bad , but I did n't . I went against my nature , and I did it for you . " <p> " Thanks " <p> Daddy touched the butt of his gun , and the look on his face was regretful . " I let him hit me in the face , " he said . " So you could see what I 'm like now . How much I can take . " <p> Momma shuddered . " Oh God , Luke . It hurt me , seeing that . It 's a terrible thing to see someone you love get hurt . I was so scared you 'd  --  " She paused and glanced at me , her gaze going veiled , " do what you did that other time . " <p> " Not in front of you and Ingrid . I would n't . " Daddy took a large swallow of bourbon . Saying , laughing , so you could n't tell if he was serious , " I can catch up with Maynard Zink some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . <p> Momma was looking at me like she just remembered me . Saying , in the careful-stepping way of a drunk , " Ingrid Did n't I tell you to go to bed an hour ago ? " <p> I said , " I 'm not sleepy , Momma . I 'm OK . " <p> " It 's past one in the morning . Sweetie , you 're exhausted , look at you . " <p> Momma laid her dry , warm palm against my forehead . Made that caressing-petting gesture I loved  --  I 'd shut my eyes like a cat shuts its eyes being stroked  --  smoothing my hair back , drawing her hand down to the nape of my neck , and a little tickle there . I basked in Momma 's touch , and in Daddy so close , seeing . <p> I said , whining , " I 'm not , Momma . I 'm wide awake like you . " <p> They laughed at me , I must have been dazed with tiredness , and Daddy touched me , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , Chloe . Then we can talk . " <p> " You put her to bed . " <p> " You 're the mother . " <p> " And thank God I am , since she has n't got a father . " <p> " She has . She knows she has . Do n't you , Ingrid ? That 's why I 'm here . I am her father . " <p> Daddy reached for the matchbook and knocked it to the floor , and I stooped to get it for him . Marita 's , Crystal Lake , Florida . <p> A car passed in the street outside . We all listened . <p> Momma said bitterly , " We 'd be expected to live like this ? The three of us ? " <p> " We 'd live in Florida . I 've got different places there I stay . It 's a different world there . " <p> Momma laughed . " Under what name , Luke ? Or names ? What would be our new names ? " <p> Daddy shrugged . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , but I do n't take any chances . " <p> " Right . Look what happened to Vaughn . " <p> " That 's right . Look what happened to Vaughn . " <p> " Do you know anything about that , Luke ? Who killed him ? " <p> Daddy looked at Momma , lifting his hands and spreading the fingers wide in a gesture meant to signal not just innocence but bafflement . " No . No , I do n't . " <p> There was a pause . Then Momma weakened , that way she had , so suddenly you never knew ; it scared me to see her change even when I hated her . She said , begging , " Luke , please . I love you . It 's right  --  I 'll never love anyone else . But I ca n't listen to this . I do n't even know what you 're saying . My heart 's racing like crazy , feel it ? "  --  taking Daddy 's hand and placing it against her chest , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and kissed Momma on her pale , hurt lips . <p> " We 'll discuss it when we get there . " <p> " Get where , Luke ? " <p> " Where we 're going . Tomorrow . " <p> Momma began crying quietly . Her fingers to her eyes and the hot tears spilling through . <p> " We are going , " Daddy said . " That 's why I 'm here . Right , baby ? " <p> He was looking at me , smiling . One side of his face swollen so he looked like a balloon wrongly inflated . Seeing Momma cry this time I was crying , too . So sleepy , my head swaying on my shoulders . <p> Daddy said , scolding , " Look at her . You 're a bad influence , Chloe . " <p> Surprising me , then , lifting me in his arms . So strong So tall It was like I was a little girl again , lifted toward the ceiling , squealing as if I was being tickled , but I was too sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her feet , saying , " Luke , please  --  if you turned yourself in ... " and Daddy said , amused , " Yeah ? " and Momma said , " If you got a lawyer , Luke , in Port Oriskany ... " and Daddy said , " Oh yeah ? Tell me . " Carrying me from the kitchen to the back part of the house as Momma began to lose it , shouting after us , " If you loved us , you would If you loved us , you would " Momma was drunk , and Daddy called back over his shoulder , the way you humor a drunk person , " You think I do n't love you ? Yeah ? " <p> I remember : Daddy carrying me in his arms into the little room that was my own room separate from Momma 's , bringing me to my bed with the fawns and lambs painted on the headboard he 'd never in his life set eyes upon but knew unerringly where it was , and now Momma was in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved us You 'd turn yourself in , or let us go . " Daddy laid me on my bed and pulled the covers over me and stooped to kiss me on the cheek . Hot , breathy whiskey-kiss , and his beard that scratched . Saying so soft Momma maybe could n't hear , only me : " What 've I got to do to prove how much I love you ? Blow us all away ? " <p> But in the morning , Daddy was gone . <p> In the night I 'd been wakened by a telephone ringing and I 'd heard voices but I was too groggy to get out of bed to investigate , and in the morning suddenly I woke again hearing voices and I remembered the night before and I ran breathless out into the kitchen and there was Momma , alone , hunched over at the table  --  Momma in her red lacy-rayon nightgown Mr. Zink had given her , her breasts hanging loose and heavy , the nipples showing through the thin fabric so I was stricken with shyness seeing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momma had never looked so haggard . Her hair was matted like a crazy woman 's on TV . She was barefoot , and even her feet looked knobby-boned , bluish-white , ugly . Momma sitting at the table that was still crowded with ale bottles and an ashtray overflowing with butts , Momma smoking a cigarette , dropping ash on what I had to come closer to see was scattered bills  --  money ? The voices that had wakened me , bright and antic , were radio voices . It was 7:55 A.M. <p> I was scared and excited , asking , " Where 's Daddy ? " <p> Momma squinted at me like the shape of me was hard to bring into focus . Like , swerving into her line of vision , her dreamy-hungover head , I was too much for her to absorb . <p> " Momma ? Where 's Daddy ? " <p> I felt how empty the house was . Beneath the radio voices a terrible silence . <p> Momma 's first response ( she would deny afterward ) was meant td be a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lips twitching in the vague , quick smile of a woman in shock , eyes fixed on me , shiny as glass . <p> I stared at her . Pulses beat in my eyes . If Momma 'd taken up our twelve-inch carving knife and split her skull like a melon to show me the madness inside I could not have been more astonished . <p> " But  --  where 's Daddy ? What happened to Daddy ? " <p> Still Momma kept up that smile , a smile turning hard . My eyes moved . over the empty ale bottles , the empty Old Granddad bottle and glasses in the sink , last night 's supper dishes soaking . Blood-stiffened towels the linoleum floor . Momma said , jeering , " Must 've dreamt it , silly . There 's no Daddy here , and never was . Not in this house . " <p> Like walking in my sleep I went into the living room , seeing the overturned furniture , the broken ceramic lamp that had been so beautiful , the ugly mess of the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in a crooked mirror . Who 's that ? You have to laugh . <p> I looked out the front window and there was no car at the curb . I ran out , sliding on ice on the porch , barefoot and shivering , seeing only Momma 's sexy little car , she called it , a bronze Cougar Mr. Zink had helped her to buy , in the driveway . " Daddy ? Daddy ? " I started to cry . Behind me Momma was yelling for me to shut the goddamned door , get inside and shut the goddamned door , did I want everyone in the fucking neighborhood to know our private business ? <p> Inside , I saw Momma coming at me and I ran down the hall into her bedroom  --  " Daddy Daddy "  --  but the room was empty , just the smell of him , a powerful smell of him that hit me like a blow , the hair oil , the sweaty man-smell . Sheets that looked like they 'd been torn off the bed , a pillow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , the cute little black sweater , her jeans , black bra , and panties on the floor . I ran to the window , staring out , seeing  --  what ? A rotted fence at the rear of the property , tall thistles and grasses covered in dewy snow . During the night the rain had frozen . <p> Momma followed me into the bedroom , stumbling and scolding , slapping at me as I tried to duck under her hand . " Just shut your mouth " she cried . " Nobody 's here , and he never was here What do you mean , mocking your mother ? " <p> This went on for a while ; I was crying and furious and Momma was in her crazy state . Then Momma quieted down , that way she had of doing ; like a wildfire burning itself out . Around 8:30 A.M. she called to me to come out from where I was hiding ( ' d crawled under my bed ) ; she was back at the kitchen table , her face washed now and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hair had not been combed . Except for the money and two glasses of fruit juice , the table had been cleared . " Ingrid , honey , come help me ? Please ? " Momma said . Sweet as sugar . <p> Explaining this : at 4:30 A.M. a call had come for my father from a friend warning him to get away from the house and out of Tintern Falls as quickly as possible . Somebody had alerted the sheriff 's office that Lucas Boone was back . So he 'd left ; he 'd left without being able to say goodbye to me , but he 'd told Momma to tell me how much he loved me . He 'd get in touch with us , he 'd promised . And in the meantime there was this money he wanted us to have , and Momma wanted my assistance now to count it . <p> My eyes were sore from crying . I approached Momma with caution , like a dog that 's been kicked too many times . But seeing Momma was calm now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , for sure he loved her little girl , would never let anyone hurt her . <p> And there was the orange juice bright as orange neon , a glass for Momma and a glass for Ingrid , and I was famished . <p> Craziness does that , makes you famished . Blood sugar drops , you start hearing voices and seeing things , scurrying black bugs , sparks shooting off light bulbs or people 's eyes , weird-faced demons in shiny surfaces . Even in a kitchen , any shiny surface . You learn quick to ingest any nourishment offered you from any source . <p> Loving any guy who 'd shoot up with me , pressing the sweet sharp needle into my arm . <p> So I sat with Momma that morning . In the kitchen of the little clapboard bungalow on North End Avenue , Tintern Falls . From which we 'd have been evicted like deadbeats if we had n't been quick and prideful enough to move out that very day . Momma used to say , You got to know when to move . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Momma and the two of us absorbed in counting our wealth of bills . Never seen anything like it before Three times counting , because each time we 'd get a different sum . And a fourth time , giddy and laughing like girls together . Some of the bills fluttered to the floor out of Momma 's hands ; I was the one to retrieve them . Momma 'd get dizzy leaning over too sharp . I never stopped to wonder why  --  if Mr. Zink had called them , and who else would have called them  --  the Eden County sheriff 's men had n't showed up at the house . Or why , warned they were corning like she 'd said , Momma had n't even put on her clothes . Not till years later realizing : Chloe Boone in the shrewdness of desperation must have arranged for that warning call herself . Must have slipped out of bed once my father was safely asleep and in stealth telephoned a mutual friend , some man with whom , who knows why , she was closer now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low , panicked voice her situation . Help me Help me I 'll make it up to you Please And this man for Momma 's sake called the house shortly afterward , rousing Daddy from bed , sounding the alarm . Somebody 's tipped off the sheriff . You better get the hell out . And Daddy believed him , for why should n't he have believed him , this man was Daddy 's friend . Anyway , it was a world of sudden arrivals and more sudden departures . A world of guns that might be fired , or might not . A world of sheriff 's deputies surrounding the house while you slept , yelling Open up Open up Breaking down doors in the night . <p> So my father Lucas Boone threw on his clothes . Left money for his wife and little girl he was so crazy for he 'd maybe have had to kill them to prove it . Left by night , drove away fast in his car rented under some stranger 's name . <p> But knowing none of this at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November . Sitting excited and happy with Momma at the kitchen table , drinking our orange juice and eating stale honey-glazed doughnuts , sorting the money Daddy had left for us into piles the neatest we could make them with our sticky fingers : twenty-dollar bills , fifty-dollar bills , hundred-dollar bills Momma kept marveling like a drunk woman , Can you believe it , honey ? Can you believe it ? <p> There were eleven hundred-dollar bills there . Our final count was $4,860 . <p>
