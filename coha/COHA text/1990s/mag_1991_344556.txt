Her return was ballyhooed more fervently than Gorbachev 's comeback from the Crimea , but KATIE COURIC proved herself up to the hype . When the perky co-host of NBC 'S Today show resumed her place on the couch Monday after a well- publicized two-month maternity leave , she did it all . Doubled forward with interest , like the most attentive date you 've ever had , she quizzed Katharine Hepburn about her early days as an actress . Eyes narrowing ever so slightly in concern , she probed Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney about whether the U.S. still needs the B-2 bomber . Zoning out helpfully , she lobbed puffballs ( " Did you ever dream you 'd be so successful ? " ) at radio deejays Mark and Brian , stars of a new NBC series . And , of course , she brought baby pictures . After years of experimentation , network television may have finally developed the perfect morning-show host : smart but unassuming , cute but not plastic , the girl next door with a grin that reaches for the rafters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Willard . Who was that Jane person anyway ?  --  R.Z.
