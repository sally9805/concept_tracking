EVERY WOMAN 'S DILEMMA CONGRATULATIONS FOR PRESENTING THE crucial and complex topic of estrogen therapy COVER STORY , June 26 . It is an issue that directly affects more than half the world 's population . How does a woman decide what path to take in a sea of changing and conflicting information ? Evidence strongly indicates a longer disease-free life-span with sustained independence in women on estrogen-replacement therapy compared with those who do not take estrogen . It seems there is an egg-size risk ( breast cancer , uterine cancer ) compared with a watermelon-size benefit ( less heart disease , less disabling osteoporosis ) . One should never take a medication that has theoretical benefit in the future if it decreases the quality of life in the present . But seeing a hunched-over , frail woman shuffling behind a walker has to stir the thought , What would her life be like had she been on estrogen the past 20-plus years ? RICKI POLLYCOVE , M.D. San Francisco A MAJOR DISSERVICE HAS BEEN DONE TO the women of this country . The article on estrogen fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HALINA WICZYK , M.D. Springfield , Massachusetts <P> WHY DO THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT and our culture think every woman wants to look younger than she is and have a menstrual period forever ? I 'll be happy to take estrogen as soon as they come up with a pill that makes flabby , wrinkled , balding men over 50 look younger too . MEREDITH SMALL Ithaca , New York <P> ARE N'T WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT QUALITY of life vs. quantity of life ? My aunt is in her 80s , I am in my 50s . She dances ; I run  --  on estrogen . JILL SWEITZER Orinda , California <P> I THINK I 'LL LIVE WITH THE WRINKLES . BEVERLY WALTERS New York City <P> I SEE APPROXIMATELY 25 WOMEN EVERY day who are 50 or older . The difference between women on long-term hormone-replacement therapy and those who are not on it is generally quite striking . If selected properly for family history and certain other cancer risks , patients on HRT can expect a much fuller , happier and healthier life . Those who say menopause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more natural to take hormones . As for the contention that there are financial incentives for doctors prescribing hormones , this is utter bunk . BRIAN PECK , M.D. Waterbury , Connecticut <P> THERE ARE MYRIAD WAYS TO GET AROUND the estrogen question . A woman can use herbs , vitamins and a positive mental at titude . A woman of my age ( 40 ) can not remain ignorant of the " horrors " that lie ahead . But I wear my vivid shock of silver hair front and center . I survey my body with honest appraisal and admit that I do n't look like I used to . And though faced with incontrovertible evidence that I have become " a woman of a certain age , " I would n't be younger for anything or anyone . I am proud of what the years have made me , and that includes looking younger than my age without the help of surgery or drugs .
