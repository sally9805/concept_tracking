None of us liked waiting in ambush , primarily because we could n't be wholly certain we were n't the ones being set up for a hot-vape . The Invids  --  the pirate crews working with the ex-Imperial Star Destroyer Invidious  --  had so far eluded the best efforts of the New Republic to engage them . They seemed to know where we would be , when we would get there , and in what force , then planned their raids appropriately . As a result we spent a lot of time doing battle-damage assessments on their efforts , and they really pushed to give us plenty of BDA work . Rogue Squadron had gone to ground to wait on several of the larger asteroids in the K'vath system . This location put us in close proximity to K'vath 5 's primary moon , Alakatha . We powered down our engines and had our sensors in passive mode only to avoid detection by the folks we wanted to trap . According to our mission briefing , New Republic Intelligence had gotten a tip they considered reliable that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting a luxury liner coming out of the resort coast on Alakatha 's northern continent . Mirax and I had actually honeymooned there three years ago , before Thrawn turned the New Republic inside-out , so I had fond memories of the place and could well remember the wealth dripping in jewels and precious metals from the throats and hands of the New Republic 's elite . I glanced at my X-wing 's chronometer . " The Glitterstar is still on schedule ? " Whistler , nestled behind my cockpit , hooted with just a hint of derision in his voice . " Yes , I know I told you to let me know if there was a change and , no , I did n't think it had slipped your circuits . " I forced my gloved hands open , then rotated my wrists to get rid of some of the tension . " I 'm just anxious . " He blatted a quick comment at me . " Hey , just because patience is a virtue , that does n't make impatience a vice . " I sighed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jedi breathing exercise Luke Skywalker had urged upon me when trying to recruit me as a Jedi . Breathing in through my nose to a count of four , I held the breath for a seven count , then exhaled in eight beats . With each breath I let more tension flow out of me . I sought the clarity of mind I 'd need for the coming battle  --  if the Invids materialized  --  but it eluded me with the ease the Invids had shown in escaping the New Republic . Things kept seeming to happen fast . Mirax and I married fast , and while I did not at all regret having done so , events conspired to make our married life extremely difficult . Grand Admiral Thrawn and his antics ruined our first anniversary , and rescuing Jan Dodonna and the others who had once been imprisoned with me on the Lusankya had called me away during the second . And then the reborn Emperor 's assault on Coruscant dropped a Star Destroyer on what had been our home . Neither of us were there at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the only benefit of being assigned to go after the Invids was that their leader , ex-Moff Leonia Tavira , seemed to have a taste for a life of leisure . When her Invidious vanished between raids , we usually had a week of down time before having to worry about another attack . Mirax and I put this free time to good use , rebuilding our home and our relationship , but with that came some consequences that I saw as incredibly disruptive  --  on the scale of Thrawn disruptive . Mirax decided she wanted children . I have nothing against kids  --  as long as they go home with their parents at the end of the day . Expressing this opinion in those terms to Mirax was not the smartest thing I had ever done and , in fact , proved to be one of the more painful ones . The hurt and pain in her eyes haunted me for a long time . Deep down , I knew there would be no dissuading her , and I was n't even sure , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and employed most of the standard arguments to do so . The " this is an unsettled time in the galaxy " ploy lost out to the fact that our parents had faced a similar choice and we 'd turned out pretty well . The " uncertainty of my job " argument wilted beneath the logic of my life insurance and then withered away when Mirax gave me a glimpse at the accounts files  --  the real ones  --  for her import/export business . She pointed out that she could easily support the three or four of us and I 'd not have to work a single second , outside of caring for the children . And , she noted , that carrying a child for nine full months meant she would already have 3.11 years of forty-hour weeks of child-care logged and that I would owe her . Over and above all that , she said I 'd make a great father . She noted that my father had done a great job with me . Having learned from him the skills of being a father , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using that argument , she turned the love and respect I had for my father around on me . She made it seem as if I was dishonoring his memory by not bringing children into the world . It was a most persuasive argument , as she knew it would be , and hammered me pretty hard . In retrospect , I should have given up at the start and saved the two of us a great deal of grief . She makes her living  --  a very good living , it turns out  --  convincing all sorts of folks that junk no one else wants is absolutely vital to them . While she engaged me in logical discussions  --  focusing my defenses on that avenue of attack  --  she slipped past my guard on a purely emotional level . Little comments about what kind of child our genetic lottery would produce got me investing brainsweat in solving that puzzle . That went straight to the detective training in me  --  the training that would n't let me drop a case until I had an answer . Which , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flick on the HoloNet monitors when some event featuring news about Leia Organa Solo 's three-year-old twins was being shown . The children were frighteningly cute and their very existence had been blamed for a baby-binge in the New Republic . I knew Mirax was not so shallow as to be wanting a child out of envy or to be trendy , but she did note that she was Leia 's age , and that it was a good time to have a child or two . And that cuteness factor really can get under your skin . The New Republic media avoided showing the twins drooling and dripping the way children do , and they really maximized the appealing things about the toddlers . It got so that when I did remember dreams , they were of me cradling a sleeping child in my arms . Oddly enough , I stopped thinking of those dreams as nightmares pretty quickly and did my best to preserve them in my mind . Realizing I was lost , I began to bargain for time . Mirax flat refused to accept fixed time dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made things conditional . I told her once the Invids were taken care of , we 'd make a final decision . She accepted my decision a bit better than I expected , which started preying on me , and making me feel guilty . I would have thought that was a tactic she 'd decided to use , but she thought guilt was a hammer and she 's definitely a vibroblade fan . I exhaled slowly again . " Whistler , remind me when we get home , Mirax and I need to make a decision on this baby thing , now , not later . Tavira 's not going to dictate my life . " Whistler 's happy high staccato sailed down into a low warning tone . I glanced at my primary monitor . The Glitterstar had lifted from Alakatha and another ship had appeared in-system . Whistler identified it as a modified bulk cruiser known as the Booty Full . Unlike the liner 's sleek design , the cruiser was studded with warty protrusions that quickly detached themselves and began to run in on the liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three flight has contact . One cruiser and eighteen uglies heading in on the Glitterstar . " Tycho 's voice came back cool and calm . " I copy , Nine . Engage the fighters with two flight . One has the cruiser . " I flicked over to three flight 's tactical channel . " Light them up , Rogues , we have the fighters . " I started the engines , then shunted power to the repulsorlift coils . The X-wing rose like a ghost from a grave and came about to point its nose toward the liner . As Ooryl 's X-wing pulled up on my left and my other two pilots , Vurrulf and Ghufran , arrived on the right , I punched the throttle full forward and launched myself into the fight . A smile blossomed on my face . Any sapient creature making a claim to sanity would find hurtling along in a fragile craft of metal and ferro-ceramics to be stupid or suicidal . Pushing that same craft into battle merely compounded the situation , and I knew it . By the same token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combat  --  or engaging any enemy in a fight  --  because doing that is the one point where civilization demands us to harness our animal nature and employ it against a most dangerous prey . Without being physically and mentally and even mechanically at my best , I would die and my friends might even die with me . But I had no intention of letting that happen . With a flick of my thumb I switched from lasers over to proton torpedoes and allowed for single fire . I selected an initial target and eased the crosshairs on my heads-up display onto its outline . Whistler beeped steadily as he worked for a target lock , then the box surrounding the fighter went red and his tone became a constant . I hit the trigger and launched my first proton torpedo . It streaked away hot and pinkish-white , trailed by others lancing out from my flight . While employing proton torpedoes against fighters is seen as overkill by some pilots , within Rogue Squadron using such a tactic was always seen as an expedient way of lowering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hutt and decidedly more ugly . The Invids used a form of custom-designed fighter called a Tri-fighter . It started with the ball cockpit and ion engine assembly of Seinar System 's basic TIE fighter  --  a commodity which , after hydrogen and stupidity , was the most plentiful in the galaxy  --  and married it to a trio of angular blades set 120 degrees apart . The bottom two served as landing gear , while the third came up over the top of the cockpit . The fighter still had the TIE 's twin lasers mounted beneath the cockpit , while the third tine sprouted an ion cannon . The ships also had some basic shields , which explained why they were more successful than your basic eyeball , and side viewports cut into the hull gave the pilot more visibility . Because the trio of tines looked as if they were grasping at the cockpit , we 'd nicknamed the design " clutch . " The shields and extra visibility did n't help the clutch I 'd targeted . The proton torpedo jammed itself right up the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit before detonating . The fighter flew into the roiling , golden ball of fire and just vanished . Three more clutches exploded nearby , then another three exploded off to starboard , where two flight was coming in . " Pick targets carefully , three flight . Ooryl , we 're on the pair to port . " " Ten copies , Nine . " I kicked my X-wing up on the port stabilizer foils and hauled back on the stick . Chopping power to the engine , I tightened the circle , then rolled out to the right as the pirates started a long serpentine turn . I switched over from missiles to dual lasers and immediately got a yellow box around the lead fighter . I goosed the throttle back to full to close range and keyed my comm . " I 'm on the leader . " Ooryl gave me a double-click on his comm to let me know he 'd gotten the message . Nudging the stick just a bit right , the targeting box went green and I hit the firing button . Two red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clutch trailed sparks from the shield generator like a comet trailing ice . The second bolt pierced the cockpit and though it hit kind of high , it hit hard , too . Sparks shot from the hole and the clutch began a slow spiral down toward Alakatha . Ooryl rolled to port as the other clutch broke . I brought my X-wing around in behind him as he lined his shot up . The Gand 's first two shots blasted past the shields and burned furrows in the ship 's hull . The next two drilled the engines , jetting the disintegrating ship forward on a golden gout of flame . The flame abruptly died , leaving the Tri-fighter to tumble through space out toward the asteroid belt . Up through the cockpit canopy I could see the green and white streaky ball of Alakatha and the Glitterstar rising up from it . Off to starboard the Booty Full seemed to crouch in the void like a malignant insect . The turbolasers along its spine and in a belly turret fired out , trying to track one flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fighters . Colonel Celchu , Hobble , Janson and Gavin Darklighter were old hands at pulling the teeth of raiders like these . As long as we kept the clutches busy , the Booty Full had no chance . The X-wing 's first slashing attack came from Tycho and Hobbie . They rolled through and each drove a proton torpedo into the aft shields . Coming from the other direction , Gavin and Wes Janson strafed the ship with laser fire . Gavin 's second burst melted the belly turret clean away while Janson 's shots nibbled away at the ship 's aft vector jets . The Booty Full was done , though I had no doubts it would take a couple more passes before the crew realized that and surrendered . I followed Ooryl up and around the back toward the fight . It had fairly well degenerated into a chase-and-kill run . The loss of seven ships before they even saw their enemies had clearly shocked the pirates and , more importantly , brought their numbers down close to ours . While clutches were more agile than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fighting them difficult  --  they could n't outrun us or outgun us . Lacking the discipline of a trained military unit like Rogue Squadron , when panic set in , they fell apart and made our job that much easier . Ooryl settled in on one and hit it with a full quad burst from his lasers . The clutch exploded , but boiling in through the explosion came another clutch making a head-to-head pass at Ooryl . The clutch got off a shot with the ion cannon that sent a lightning storm skittering over Ooryl 's shields , but they died before the ion blast did . The motivator blew on his R5 unit and Whistler reported his engines were out . " Ooryl , go for a restart . " I did n't know if he still had comm or not , but I offered that bit of advice and fired a dual burst at the clutch . Hastily aimed , the shot missed low , but did cause the clutch to veer off . Rolling out to the right , I headed in after him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vurrulf , the Klatooinan in three flight , barked a harsh , " I copy , on it , " so I felt a bit safer in pursuing the clutch . One of the worst things a pilot can do is to get so locked in on a target that he misses what else is happening . When situational awareness focuses down on one target , the hunter becomes hunted and never knows what hits him . It 's a rookie mistake and while I 'm no rookie , I 'm not immune to it . The clutch 's pilot was good and clearly had no desire to die , but Whistler was n't reporting that he 'd powered down his weapons , so he was just as clearly willing to fight . I tried to settle in on him , but he modulated his throttle and used his ship 's agility to keep breaking before I could get a lock . I snapped a couple of shots off at him , but they missed wide or high . Try as I might , I was having trouble keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the throttle and let him gain some distance . His joking antics continued , but with range the movements that had ripped him out of my sights in close barely broke the edges of my targeting box . I hit the firing button and sent two paired bursts at him . One pair lanced through the aft shield and mangled one of the landing tines . The other two energy darts clipped the thrust vector vents on the port side , limiting his maneuverability . Whistler displayed a comm frequency being used by the clutch and I punched it up on my comm unit . " This is Captain Corran Horn of the New Republic Armed Forces . I will accept your surrender . " A woman answered me . " Do n't you know , Invids never surrender ? " " Not true of the Booty Full . " " Riizolo is a fool , but he does n't have a capital warrant out on his head . I do . " She laughed . " I have nothing to live for , except my honor . One pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll die . " A single pass would negate the clutch 's agility advantage . She had to know that . " But perhaps not alone . " Her ship stopped jinking and headed out on a long loop . " Allow me this honor . " The clutch turned and began its run at me . I wanted to do as she asked , and would have , except for one thing : the Invids had proved over and over again that they had no honor . I switched to proton torpedoes , got a quick tone-lock from Whistler and pulled the trigger . The missile shot from my X-wing and sprinted straight for her ship . As good as she was , the clutch pilot knew there was no dodging it . She fired with both lasers , but they missed . Then , at the last moment , she shot an ion blast that hit the missile . Blue lightning played over it , burning out every circuit that allowed the torpedo to track and close on her ship . I 'm fairly certain , just for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a projectile is that even if its sophisticated circuitry fails , it still has a lot of kinetic energy built up . Even if it never senses the proximity of its target and detonates , that much mass moving that fast treats a clutch cockpit much the way a needle treats a bubble . The torpedo drove the ion engines out the back of the clutch , where they exploded . The fighter 's hollow remains slowly spun off through space and would eventually burn through the atmosphere and give resort guests a thrill . Whistler made my threat screen all green indicating no more active hostiles in the area . Three flight reported in and Ooryl was back up and running . His forward shield had collapsed and refused to come back up , but otherwise he was fine . Vurrulf and Ghufran reported no trouble with their X-wings . As it turned out only Reme Pollar in two flight had been hit hard enough to be forced extra-vehicular , but she reported she would be fine until the Skipray blast boat from the Glitterstar picked her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All green here , Rogue Leader . " " I copy , Nine . Looks like this was n't the trap we feared it would be . " " No , sir , it does n't . " " Have your people prepare to rejoin the fleet . " " As ordered , Colonel . " I relayed the order to my people , but before we could reach my designated rendezvous point , the fleet made a microjump in from the edge of the system . A Mon Calamari Cruiser and two Victory-class Star Destroyers formed a triangle in the space above Alakatha . We 'd come to the system aboard Home One and used microjumps to get in as close as we did . Because the information about the Booty Full had been unusual , we expected it might be an ambush , so the fleet had waited to see if the Invids would pounce on the Rogues . If they had , we would have gotten a chance to finish them once and for all . I keyed my comm . " Colonel , if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , was this mission a success ? " " Good question , Nine . This is one of these missions where only Intelligence will be able to tell us how we did . " Tycho hesitated for a moment . " Then again , we lost only machines , not people . It 's a victory anytime that happens . "
