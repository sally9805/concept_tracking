August , 1931 Lily was hot and cranky . She shoved her damp , limp hair back under her wilted summer straw hat and closed her eyes for a moment . She was wearing her last pair of undarned silk stockings , which on such a blistering day had been an awful mistake . The taxicab , which was really just an old black Ford with TAXI inexpertly stenciled on the driver 's door , kept lurching along the steep , tree-encroached tunnel of a road , tossing her around annoyingly . And if her brother Robert did n't soon stop that tuneless whistling , she 'd have to consider throwing herself out the door and ending it all . Or perhaps she 'd just shove Robert out into the shrubbery . They 'd arrived by train from New York City in Voorburg-on-Hudson at noon on a steamy Saturday , and had taken a quick look around the attractive little pre-Revolutionary town . They 'd waited for a taxicab quite a while before finding out that the town had only the one and the stationmaster had to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the noon train , " the stationmaster had said , " but he might still be at Mabel 's Cafe . " Robert had laughed heartily at this . " In hard times , it 's good to know there really is a Mabel 's Cafe somewhere . " " Tired , darlin ' Lil ? " Robert asked later , as the taxi driver took a sharp turn , flinging them about in the backseat like dice in a cup . " Tired and hot . " " But it 's much nicer here than in the city today , " Robert said . She opened her eyes and glared at him . He looked as cool as an iced drink in a crystal glass . Sometimes she hated her brother . Especially when he was right . It was August and New York City was so hot that sometimes she feared her lungs would scald if she took another breath , and her feet would fry from the searing pavements . For the last week all she 'd wanted in life was to be alone and stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan she and Robert had in their tiny two-room apartment in the tenement in the Lower East Side . But instead , she 'd dragged herself off every weekday morning at eight and walked the twelve blocks to her dreary , menial job at the Chase National Bank where she sat on a high backless stool at a big table all day with seven other women and sorted checks into tidy piles . A comfortable chair and interesting conversation would have made the job more tolerable , but Lily had so little in common with the other women that they might as well have been speaking different languages . In fact , English was n't the native language of several of them . By the time she reached home at six , Robert had usually fixed her a light supper and was dressing for his evening of earning his living , such as it was . The jobs changedsometimes he was a bartender in the more socially acceptable speakeasies , sometimes he hired himself out as a dancing partner and escort to elderly ladies who fawned over him and introduced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old biddies , ' he called them privately . Occasionally he substituted for the maitre d ' at the Cafe Savarin , Fraunces Tavern , Luchow 's or the Algonquinrestaurants that catered to those who had , against all odds , held onto their wealth . Lily often thought it must be humiliating for him to come down to being an employee rather than a customer , but he had never complained . The only things Robert 's jobs all had in common was that he had to look spectacularly handsome , speak well and own a tux . This was good , because playing a fair game of polo , looking and acting top-drawer , and being relentlessly cheerful were Robert 's only skills , highly developed as they were . " We did n't have to come all the way up here , you know . It was all your idea , " Robert said amiably . Robert was almost always amiable . Lily wondered if she could reach the door handle on his side of the taxi before he could become aware of her intentions . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty ? " she asked . " Attorneys do n't put ads in the papers asking specific people to contact them for news to their advantage for no reason . " " I still think it 's a con , " Robert said cheerfully . " Some rumrunner is going to meet us at this cottage and tell us we can make a fortune with just a few illegal trips across the Canadian border . Still , it 's a lark and gets us out of town for a day . Dear God , Lily , everything 's so damned rural here , just a couple hours ' train ride out of the city . Who 'd have thought ... " He gazed out the window as though it were as foreign as a desert or an arctic landscape . " I 'm just the tiniest bit afraid of trees , you know . You can never tell what they 're going to do . " That made her laugh , as she knew he intended . " Trees do n't do anything , Robert . " He grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about that . And they drop leaves and bark that somebody has to pick up and discard . And sometimes peacocks nest in them overnight and mess up your car . That happened to me once at the Breakers . " In another life ... Lily thought . Our other life . " Here you are , folks , " the taxicab driver said , taking a sharp turn between two stone pillars that were nearly covered with ivy . " Honeysuckle Cottage . " Lily gawked at the structure , wondering how anyone could have misnamed it so badly . It was n't a cottage . It was a great hulking monster of a mansion . And if there was honeysuckle growing anywhere , it was having to put up a good fight with the weeds , coarser vines and acres of ivy that almost entirely obscured the facade of the house and most of the windows . Aside from the few random turrets sticking up bravely through the greenery , it looked more like a burial mound with extremely luxuriant foliage than a house . Lily counted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not downright stingy tip . " You 'll come back for us in an hour ? " The taxi driver was counting the pile of change she 'd given him . " Uh-huh , " he said reluctantly , grinding the gears and chugging off . Lily and Robert stared at the house for a long moment and Robert was the first to spot what might be a front door . He pushed aside an especially aggressive vine and knocked firmly . They heard footsteps , a crash that sounded like a small table falling over and a muffled curse , before the door opened . The man standing in the semidarkness was small , elderly and had badly dyed black hair and a matching pencil-thin moustache . " You must be Miss Lillian Brewster and Mr. Robert Brewster . Come in , please . We 'll talk in the library . " They followed him gingerly down the dark central hall , alongside a massive staircase and into a room at the back of the house . Robert amused himself by pretending to be blind and having to feel his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library . This room was magnificent . It was flooded with light from a pair of French doors and ranks of large windows in the back wall . Lily walked forward and realized the room presented a breathtaking panorama of a long green lawn and a superb view of the Hudson River , curving gently below them . None of the voracious vines were allowed to obscure the view from this room . The other walls were covered with bookshelves with elaborately etched glass doors protecting them from dust . " I 'm Mr. Elgin Prinney , Esquire , " the elderly man said as he fastidiously swatted a large handkerchief at the seats of three chairs grouped at the end of a long , gracefully proportioned library table . " Please sit down . " Lily had to make a real effort to tear her gaze away from the river . She sat down in the chair facing the windows . Pretending to fuss with the lock on his document case , Elgin Prinney secretly studied the young pair . A very good-looking young man who seemed frivolous but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far too thin and tired-looking for her own good . At least she loved the view . He hoped they really were the young people that he 'd been searching for . " I believe you 've brought the documents I requested when you telephoned me ? " Mr. Prinney said . Lily opened the small case she 'd been clutching for hours . She removed two baby books , hers and Robert 's , which had family trees filled in on the front pages . Each book also had a formal invitation to their respective christenings , giving their parents ' names and the dates of Lily 's and Robert 's births . She 'd also managed to acquire copies of birth records from city hall , an obituary noting their mother 's death and a more recent death certificate for their father . October , 1929 . Cause of death : suicide by defenestration . She handed these items to Mr. Elgin Prinney , Esquire , and took a long envelope from her handbag . This contained her father 's will , a picture of him from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert on the long porch of their summer home in Nantucket shortly before his death . Mr. Prinney studied all the documents slowly and thoroughly , even looking at the backs of the newspaper clippings . Robert caught Lily 's eye , grinned and winked at her . " This seems to be quite convincing . " " Convincing of what ? " Robert inquired . " That you are the children of Caroline and George Brewster . " " Of course we are . Why would anybody be benighted enough to pretend to be us ? Look here , old chap , what 's this all about ? " Mr. Prinney sighed , leaned back in his chair and tented his short fingers . " Were you aware that your father had an uncle named Horatio Brewster ? " Robert looked at Lily . " Were we ? " " Yes , he visited us one winter at the Gramercy Park apartment when we were about six and eight . You must remember . He gave us lemon drops and we ate so many we were both sick all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you had no further contact with him ? " Mr. Prinney asked . Lily shook her head . " My mother used to write everybody in the family a chatty Christmas letter and send pictures with it . And when she died , I used her address book to send cards . But I never received anything back from him so I stopped sending them . " " Do you remember what his address was ? " " Somewhere in Connecticut . I did n't think to bring Mother 's address book . Uncle Horatio 's address was in a town that started with an S ' as I remember . " Mr. Prinney nodded approvingly . " Very well . I think this adds up to adequate proof of your identity . I 'm sorry to have to inform you that Mr. Horatio Brewster died two months ago in a boating accident on the river . This had been his home for the last five years . He has left it to the two of youin a manner of speaking . " Lily and Robert exchanged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say ? " Robert asked . " Would you mind explaining what you mean by that ? " " It 's somewhat like a grace and favor benefice , with your Great-uncle Horatio 's own alterations . " " Grace and favor ? " Robert asked . " That sounds terribly upper-crusty . What does it mean ? " Lily interrupted . " Robert , do n't you remember Great-aunt Winifred in Coventry ? We visited her when we were teenagers . She lived in a grace and favor house . King Edward gave it to her and Uncle for use during their lifetimes , as an honor to Uncle 's outstanding civil service career . " " So , we inherit this ... uh ... house , " Robert said , casting a wary glance back at the gloomy hallway , " but it does n't really belong to us ? We ca n't sell it , for instance ? " " That is roughly correct , " Mr. Prinney said . " The will stipulates that you must both live in the house for ten years without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar year . But unlike a true grace and favor , it would then be entirely yours , to do with as you wish . If you fulfill this requirement , the house becomes yours . " Robert laughed heartily . " Live here for ten years ? Mr. Prune ... " " Prinney ! " " ... Prinney , we could n't afford to buy the wood to heat one room in the winter . " Mr. Prinney actually said the words " Tut-tut , " which delighted Robert . Then he went on , " You need not concern yourself with that . Mr. Horatio Brewster also left a substantial amount of cash and assets in trust , the management of which is in my hands as trustee and executor . It allows for the maintenance of the house , the furnishings and the grounds , which I must admit have been sadly neglected . At the end of the ten years , the balance of the trust will also revert to the two of you , if you have fulfilled the conditions therein . " " A substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial ... exactly ? " Mr. Prinney removed a folded sheet of ledger paper from his suit pocket and carefully opened it up . " As you know , the real estate holdings are worth only what someone is willing to pay for them , so they 're difficult to assess accurately . And I admit I failed to stop at the bank today and check on the current amount of interest and today 's gold prices , but as of last Monday the funds in the trust amounted to one million , eight hundred and twenty-three thousand , four hundred and nineteen dollars and seventeen cents . "
