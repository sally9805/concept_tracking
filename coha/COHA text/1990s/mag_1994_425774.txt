A stroll through the Brethren 's Hall of Shame <p> Nathan Goodman 's truck was only eleven-and-a-half feet from the railroad tracks when he first saw the oncoming train . An overhanging tool shed had obstructed the view of the railroad tracks and although he slammed on his brakes , there was nothing he could do to prevent crashing into the train . Luckily , he was only injured . <p> It was 1927 , and America was just beginning to realize , perhaps not as profoundly as Goodman , that the country was not designed for the automobile driver . Goodman sued the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad Company and won , but the railroad appealed the decision to the Supreme Court . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , writing for a unanimous Court , stated that to prevent circumstances when " the accidental feelings of the jury " could decide personal injury claims , the Court needed to establish a steadfast rule by which the lower courts could decide liability . <p> Neither the railroad company nor the train 's engineer has any responsibility to warn oncoming drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends entirely on the driver . After all , " he knows that he must stop for the train , not the train stop for him . " Therefore , Holmes concluded , any driver approaching railroad tracks must stop his car , get out , and walk up and down the tracks to make certain no train is coming before he can go on his way . <p> It is n't often that it can be said that a unanimous Supreme Court got something 100 percent wrong , especially when the driving force behind the error was one of the greatest legal minds in this country 's history . How could Holmes have been so backward and blind ? It probably had something to do with the fact that the good Justice had never sat behind the wheel of a car . The plight of Goodman , a professional truck driver , could not have been more alien to him . <p> Holmes ' decision was overturned seven years later . Nonetheless , it provides a textbook example of how smart justices can come up with dizzyingly dumb decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court ruled that the State of Illinois could bar women from becoming lawyers because , they reasoned , God made women inherently inferior ; or Dennis v. U.S. , in 1950 , in which Smith Act prosecutions of Communist party leaders were justified on the basis that the mere advocacy of Communist doctrine was a crime . And then , of course , there are the truly infamous : Dred Scott , which in the process of returning a freed slave to his owner the Court affirmed that slaves were in fact property ; and Plessy v. Ferguson , which in 1896 affirmed segregation and facilitated Jim Crow 's hold on the South for another two generations . <p> Even though these decisions have been overturned , the Court over the past 30 years has come up with some decisions worthy of their , to be kind , less-than-perfect predecessors . Here are a few inane decisions that are the law of the land and shape  --  for the worse  --  the way we live today . Bowers v. Hardwick , 1986 <p> Until the last minute , Justice Lewis Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case before the Court would decide whether Georgia 's statute outlawing sodomy between consenting adults was unconstitutional . As the justices debated the case in conference , their opinions began to polarize and harden : Justices Burger , White , Rehnquist , and O'Connor found for Georgia , while Justices Marshall , Blackmun , Stevens , and Brennan voted to strike down the law . The vote was four to four . Powell , attempting to reconcile his respect for the fight to privacy with an instinctive disgust with homosexuality , sat divided in his own mind . <p> Bowers v. Hardwick had begun rather innocently in the summer of 1982 , when Michael Hardwick was cited for carrying an open beer bottle in public . Hardwick paid the fine , but it had not been processed before a police officer was sent to Hardwick 's Atlanta home one morning to serve him a warrant . A friend of Hardwick 's who had spent the night in the house let the officer in and pointed him in the direction of Hardwick 's bedroom . When the officer opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The officer arrested both men on the charge of sodomy , a prohibition not enforced since 1935 , and brought them to the police station . <p> Hardwick 's attorney argued that the case presented a right to privacy issue : that the choice of whom to have sex with was something beyond the state 's jurisdiction . Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers ( he still holds the position ) countered by arguing that the right to privacy is not guaranteed in the Constitution and that the Supreme Court would be inventing a right ( as many argued it did in Roe v. Wade ) by asserting that there was a constitutional right to homosexual sex . <p> Powell , who tried desperately to find some middle ground , first voted against the Georgia law , but eventually added his name to the majority opinion written by Byron White . <p> White 's opinion is a paradigm of bluster and bigotry . It argued that homosexuality was a historical taboo , and its inherent immorality made it vulnerable to the state 's prohibition . Burger 's concurring opinion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he wrote , dating back to the Bible and the Roman Empire ( both of which , he must have known , also condoned slavery and burning witches ) . Referring to Blackstone 's commentary on English law , he described homosexuality as " the infamous crime against nature ' as an offense of deeper malignity ' than rape , a heinous act the very mention of which is a disgrace to human nature . ' " In conclusion , he argued that protecting sodomy " would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching . " <p> It is a sad postscript to Bowers that Powell admitted after his retirement from the Court in 1987 that he had been wrong . During a 1990 appearance at New York University Law School , a student asked Powell to justify his vote on the case . Almost dismissively , he said , " I think I probably made a mistake in that one . " Buckley v. Valeo , 1976 <p> The commune depicted in George Orwell 's Animal Farm is founded on one commandment : " All animals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves the ruling species , tack on an amendment : " But some animals are more equal than others . " Similar to the animals in OrWell 's classic , every American citizen has the freedom of speech . But some pigs , Ross Perot and Michael Huffington among them , have a little more freedom than the rest of us . <p> Or at least that was what the Court concluded in Buckley v. Valeo , the decision that ruled unconstitutional any limit on the amount of money a federal candidate could spend on his campaign , whether the money is his own or donated to him , on the ground that a limit would abridge the candidate 's right to free speech . <p> In 1974 , Congress passed a set of amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act that placed the spending limits on federal candidates . No sooner was it passed , though , that an unlikely assortment of politicians and civil libertarians , including New York Republican Senator James Buckley , presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy , and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed suit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they claimed , " virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of money . " <p> A U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the law , arguing that the country had a responsibility to limit the political power of the wealthy relative to the rest of the population . " It would be strange indeed , " Judge J. Skelly Wright wrote , " if ... the wealthy few could claim a constitutional guarantee to a stronger political voice than the unwealthy many because they are able to give and spend more money , and because the amount they give and spend can not be limited . " <p> But the Brethren did n't find it strange at all . The Court ruled that limiting a candidate 's spending " reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed , the depth of their exploration , and the size of the audience reached . " In short , money is equivalent to speech , and is therefore inviolable . <p> But if money is speech , then limits on political contributions should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be able to give money in exchange for a vote on a particular bill , " says American University law professor Jamin Raskin . " I 'm only speaking . And if someone else can offer more money , he 's just speaking more eloquently . " <p> The undemocratic effect of the Court 's ruling has never been more apparent than it is today . Unchecked , any candidate can dig deep into his own pocket or what he can raise from PACs to appear as a latter-day Demosthenes . Huffington , the California multimillionaire who spent $5.4 million of his own fortune to win a seat in the House of Representatives in 1992 , is expected to shell out a record $25 million challenging Senator Dianne Feinstein this year . That dwarfs the previous record of $17.7 million held by Jesse Helms , who needed every penny to ward off challenger Harvey Gantt in 1990 . <p> Helms and Huffington would n't be so extravagant if they did n't think it would do some good , and they 're right . Candidates who outspend their opponents almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsive Politics , candidates in 1992 who outspent their opponents won more than 85 percent of the time . It 's no wonder that campaign spending is snowballing . As one candidate spends more , his or her opponent is in turn forced to cozy up to PACs and wealthy political patrons . The price of participating in the political process climbs ever higher . Campaign spending for 1992 jumped 52 percent from two years earlier and with Ollie North and Huffington leading the way , 1994 is shaping up to be much the same . The deafening sound you hear is not the free exchange of political ideas , but the trampling of the democratic process . Oink . Massiah v. U.S. , 1964 <p> Herald " High " Price Fahringer likes this decision a lot . <p> " A man has been indicted , and the government takes a confederate and induces him to go to this man and take self-incriminating statements . That , in its nature , is very shocking , " he says . <p> It 's no wonder he feels the way he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . He has probably handled more appeals on behalf of mobsters than any other lawyer in New York City , if not the entire country . Massiah v. U.S has helped him do his job on a number of occasions . <p> In 1958 , Winston Massiah , along with several codefendants , was arrested , read his rights , arraigned and indicted on charges related to the smuggling of three-and-half pounds of cocaine into the United States . Massiah pleaded not guilty to the charges and was freed on bail . <p> Shortly afterwards , Massiah was discussing the case in the car of one of his codefendants , Jesse Colson . During the conversation , Massiah made several statements indicating that he was in fact guilty . Massiah did not know , however , that Colson was cooperating with the prosecutors and had his car bugged . A federal agent sitting in a car about a block away was listening to the entire conversation . <p> Massiah was convicted , but his lawyers appealed on the ground that the bug represented a violation of the defendant 's fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an appellate court . They found a more receptive welcome from the Supreme Court . <p> In a six-to-three decision written by Justice Potter Stewart , the Court held that federal agents violated Massiah 's Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself , and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel . <p> Sound crazy ? It was , but consider the context . At the time Massiah was being considered , the Warren Court was still riding the crest of the two most important right-to-counsel decisions of the century , Spano v. N.Y . in 1958 , and Gideon v. Wainwright in 1962 . In Spano , the Court reversed a murder conviction that was based on a confession obtained after eight hours of intense police interrogation . Gideon , immortalized by Anthony Lewis ' book Gideon 's Trumpet , involved a crook who had broken into a pool hall . The judge in the case denied Clarence Gideon 's requests for an attorney , forcing the nearly illiterate man to defend himself . Gideon was subsequently convicted , but had it overturned after he appealed to the Court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedents are used as the foundation of Stewart 's decision in Massiah , but you 'd be hard-pressed to find similarities between the cases . First of all , Massiah was never denied counsel . He had his own attorney , and the meetings between the two were not obstructed or spied upon by federal agents in any way . At the time of the " interrogation " ( as Stewart put it ) Massiah had every opportunity to have his attorney with him ; he simply chose not to . <p> The claims that Massiah should be protected under the Fifth Amendment are equally absurd . The Fifth Amendment states that a person can not be compelled to make self-incriminating statements . But there was no threat of violence when Massiah made his statements ; he made them because they were true . And the federal agents did n't compel Massiah to make them . They just made sure they were there when he did . <p> Massiah represents yet another obstacle to the police 's efforts to convict criminals . Only one-third of reported violent crimes end with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to protect the defendant from being railroaded by overzealous or outright corrupt police and prosecutors . The Warren Court , however , used these fights to handcuff police and prosecutors to the point where a criminal can reasonably expect never to see the inside of a prison cell . DeShaney v. Winnebago County , 1989 <p> When the Wisconsin social worker assigned to the case of Joshua DeShaney heard he was in a life-threatening coma , she said , " I just knew the phone would ring some day and Joshua would be dead . " <p> It 's not surprising she had this premonition . Anybody who knew about Joshua 's father 's repeated and vicious beatings of the four-year-old could have come to the same conclusion . What is surprising is that during the two years when the caseworker had solid evidence of child abuse , she did nothing to stop it . <p> In January 1992 , Randy DeShaney 's second ex-wife ( Joshua 's stepmother ) , reported to the police that her ex-husband beat the boy regularly . The report was referred to the Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child abuse . In an interview with a social worker , Mr. DeShaney denied abusing his son , and no action was taken . One year later , Joshua was again admitted to a hospital with suspicious bruises and abrasions . This time , the hospital delayed giving Joshua back into the custody of his father and convened a panel of social workers , a pediatrician , a psychologist , a police officer , and the Winnebago County lawyer to consider the immediate danger to Joshua . Despite the unexplained injuries and DeShaney 's ex-wife 's charge , they decided that there was not enough evidence to take Joshua away from his father and returned the boy to his custody . <p> A month later , Joshua was again admitted to a hospital . No legal action was taken , but the caseworker began to make regular calls on the DeShaney household , noting on several occasions bruises , abrasions , and injuries that would indicate child abuse . That November , Joshua was again admitted to a hospital , again inspected by the caseworker , and again returned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the call she had been expecting all along . Only Joshua was not dead , just comatose . The damage to his brain was so severe that he is expected to spend the rest of his life in a home for the severely mentally retarded . <p> Joshua 's mother took the case to court on behalf of her son , claiming that the Wisconsin DSS was responsible for damages . She lost the case in a U.S. District Court , appealed to a Court of Appeals , and lost again . She finally appealed to the Supreme Court , where she lost one last time . Wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist : " Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life , liberty , and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors . " <p> But the state , through the DSS social worker , did indeed have a responsibility to remove Joshua from his father 's custody . Wisconsin prescribes clear duties for the DSS . All reports of possible child abuse are supposed to be directed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife reported to the police that her husband was abusing Joshua , the police , rather than arresting Randy , called the DSS . In cases of child abuse , . then , the DSS assumes the role held by a police department , and therefore has the same responsibilities to protect those under its jurisdiction as the police . <p> As Justice Brennan 's dissent , joined by Marshall and Blackmun , points out , " when a State has by word and by deed ' ...  --  announced an intention to protect a certain class of citizens and has before it facts that would trigger protection under the applicable state law , the Constitution imposes upon the State an affirmative duty of protection " a duty the DSS did not fulfill . <p> Rehnquist 's decision has built a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing government officials on the ground of negligence . According to the logic in his decision , police officers are not required to stop crimes in progress , nor are firemen responsible to put out fires . Most potential negligence suits against government officials are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mistakes . Justice Blackmun , in a separate dissent , exclaimed " Poor Joshua ! " He very well could have included the rest of us as well . Elrod v. Burns , 1976 , and Branti v. Finkel , 1980 <p> DeShaney made it nearly impossible to sue government workers when they make mistakes . Protecting them even further , Elrod and Branti make it nearly impossible to fire them as well . Together , Elrod and Branti strike at the heart of an essential element in American democracy  --  political patronage . <p> The facts of the cases are simple . In the first , Richard Elrod , a Democrat , replaced Joseph Woods , a Republican , as sheriff of Cook County , Illinois . As had been done for decades , the new sheriff fired his predecessor 's political appointees and replaced them with his own . In Branti there was a similar scenario : The Rockland County ( New York ) public defender , Peter Branti , a Democrat , refused to reappoint assistant public defenders Aaron Finkel and Alan Tabakman , who were appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican political appointees filed suit , claiming that firing them solely on the grounds of their political party affiliation violated their First Amendment rights . <p> In Elrod , the Court ruled that " nonpolicy-making , nonconfidential " employees can not be fired for their party affiliation . In Branti , the Court went even further , ruling that even policy makers could be exempt from political firings if the official trying to remove them could not prove that party loyalty was required by the duties of the positions . <p> The immediate effect of the Court 's decisions was to cement the positions of the outgoing Republican administration 's political hirings . The petitioners in each case owed their jobs to the same system they attacked as unconstitutional . And given the difficulty in firing government employees , the justices  --  patronage hires themselves  --  basically gave these political appointees life terms . In other words , the Court was giving the patronage employees the same deal it has itself : get a job through politics then have it forever insulated from a turn of the political wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But there 's a reason the framers of the Constitution gave the High Court lifetime tenure while leaving patronage in place . It 's because a limited patronage system is necessary to the two-party political system . Its importance was perhaps never better stated than by Tammany Hall 's George Washington Plunkitt : <p> First , this great and glorious country was built up by political parties ; second , parties ca n't hold together if their workers do n't get offices when they win ; third , if the parties go to pieces , the government they built up must go to pieces , too ; fourth then there 'll be hell to pay . <p> Patronage actually increases democracy in a given political system by allowing elected officials a freer hand in choosing their staff . Every newly elected official has an idea of what government should look like and how it should work . How is that official to realize his vision if he is saddled with people hired by an administration that held a distinctly different view of government ? Without the ability to hire people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to streamline , or , in the current nomenclature , reinvent government , have no chance of succeeding . <p> The Court seems to think that it 's easy for an official to shape his or her own team . In truth , bad civil servants are harder to get rid of than termites , and far more destructive . An employee can only be fired if the supervisor can prove incompetence or insubordination before a hearing board . This is no small feat ; a dismissal hearing has the potential to take on the dimensions of a full civil suit . Both sides have lawyers present their case in a process that can take months to complete . Faced with the prospects of these dismissal hearings , administrators often decide firing an employee simply is n't worth the effort . Consequently , bad workers remain in their jobs and the government 's performance suffers . The patronage system offers elected officials the chance to fully implement their plans for government with subordinates who have the same political goals . <p> When most people think of patronage hirings they envision a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she ca n't type . But there 's no reason that the same skill standards that are in place in the civil service ca n't apply to patronage hirings as well . Agreement on politics can come in addition to , not instead of , professional skill . <p> To be sure , a government of unregulated patronage hirings is n't much good either . It would never get anything done if every position was newly filled every four years . By the time an administration had things up and running , they would already be on their way out . Some apolitical civil servants are vital to efficient government for the sake of continuity , just as a competence-respecting patronage system is vital for an official 's ability to implement his own policy . A balance between the two must be maintained . <p> Why could the Court only see the evils of patronage , and not its benefits ? The best answer to date comes from Mickey Kaus , who noted in a 1980 Monthly article on Branti that Supreme Court justices tend to be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person can check his beliefs at the door of his office , and pick them up again on his way home . Lawyers are the ultimate Jobbists , because their fundamental duty is to protect the interests of their client , no matter what . Even if a defense attorney knows his client is guilty , he still has a responsibility to defend him as best he can . Enforcing that view , the Court has staunchly upheld the Hatch Act , which prohibits political activity on the part of government workers . One 's political beliefs , according to the Court 's formula , are reduced to the importance of , say , one 's taste in literature  --  personally significant , but professionally irrelevant . <p> This leaves a bureaucracy full of workers with no other incentive than personal advancement . The notion that these people will work with as much determination as someone who feels a sense of commitment to a greater purpose is wrong . If an individual 's political beliefs have no place in government , then where do they have a place ? <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banning political patronage , yet cautioned his colleagues against taking theory where it clearly does not belong . " We deal here with a highly practical and rather fundamental element of our political system , not the theoretical abstractions of a political science seminar . " <p> It is a warning that in one way or another applies to all the cases mentioned here . The current members of the Supreme Court would do well to remember it . <p> BY DANIEL FRANKLIN <p> Research assistance provided by Alison McCready and Rachel Van Dongen . <p>
