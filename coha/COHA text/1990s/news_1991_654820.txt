<p> TOBIN JONES could see only a bit of " Confederate memorabilia " in last year 's controversy over the Professional Golfers Association ( PGA ) championship tournament at Alabama 's all-white Shoal Creek Country Club . <p> Golfing since he was six , the 13-year-old black Atlantan has been absorbing the skills and nuances of a game that he seems barely aware has historically been the exclusive realm of white-male bonding . And he is undaunted . <p> That 's just how golf-pro Elijah Walker wants it as he works to expose minority children to a game that is perhaps harder for them to gain access to than it is to play . <p> Mr. Walker runs the Atlanta Junior Golf Program at the John A. White Park . A wooded and hilly five-hole course , it is the only city-owned golf facility for children in the country . It is , say prominent black golfers , an example of the only way minorities in great numbers will ever begin to have a piece of the action . <p> " Access to juniors ( white or black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Joe Steranka , senior director of communications for the PGA . " How does a child get to the course to begin with , if the parent ca n't take them ( to the mainly suburban facilities ) , and how does he pay greens fees of $30 or more ? " Handful of black pros That 's why Walker 's course and program are so important . It 's free , and it 's for kids . <p> The 100 Atlanta children who participate in the city 's free program " are being exposed to a game that , without an Elijah Walker , they 'd never be exposed to , " says Calvin Peete , a black PGA tour golfer who runs a foundation promoting the sport among inner-city youths . <p> Mr. Walker is one of only a handful of black golf-teaching pros in the United States , most of whom had their first exposure to golf as country club caddies . Though the wiry athlete 's golf career has been hedged in by overt as well as subtle racism , he remains an easygoing presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the emphasis on more traditional sports for youths , Walker has not hesitated to seize every opportunity to build the junior golf program . <p> The reason Walker is here is that his career as a pro in Alabama had reached the unspoken limits that racism put on it . <p> At age 7 , he became a caddy for the the Huntsville ( Ala . ) Country Club and recalls his mother being scared when he practiced his swings at home . Later he moved up to caddy master and then went off to Alabama A &M,; where he earned a degree in mechanical arts . Along the way , he and five other black students started an unofficial college golf team , which won the Southern Conference college golf championship on its first outing . <p> After a military stint , Walker returned to Huntsville to become the assistant pro at the Redstone Arsenal Country Club , a military country club . <p> In 1971 , he applied for the court-ordered black pro position at South Atlanta 's John A. White course when it was still a municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bare dirt " course and hightailed it back to Alabama . <p> There , club management informed him that " I 'd never become head pro in Alabama , that there were n't more than about two or three black pros in the world then , and they let me know that Atlanta ( might be progress after all ) , " he says . <p> In 1978 , the John A. White course was threatened with closure . But , Mr. Walker says , " I saw my chance to work with some black inner-city kids and they left me five holes , a job , and the clubhouse . " <p> On a city budget of less than $150,000 , this is not a toney country club operation . But neither is the program just a rec-center hangout . Walker 's students are a mix of minorities including children bused in from housing projects and those of Atlanta 's wealthy black professional neighborhoods . <p> The children mow the greens , change the cups , repair equipment , and talk golf in the old stone clubhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . One pair of slightly used alligator wingtip cleats awaits the player whose dedication - and feet - grow enough to fit them , he says . <p> Walker has dreams of building the course back to its original size to make it a fully operational junior country club in which the children run the pro shop , learning retailing and repair , and caddy for senior citizens . <p> " It 's easy for me to teach minority kids golf , but its hard for me to find a place for them to play , " says Walker . <p> While his course is unique , he says , five holes alone do not permit his students to play a whole game of golf . This is the equivalent , he says , of asking Little Leaguers to play baseball without all four bases . And because he does n't have the resources to manicure the course to the " storybook " perfection of championship courses , his students can not compete very well with those privileged to practice on good courses . <p> Even if minority parents could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blacks are not permitted those memberships . <p> " Some of my kids can hit the ball as well as anyone , but they lose it around the greens , " he explains . " These kids from this old rough tall grass do n't have the finesse ... It takes them two or three putts . " <p> Measuring success Meanwhile , he explains , minorities are similarly aced out of the best junior PGA tournaments . They can not get onto PGA courses in order to play the games they need to establish a handicap that , in turn , is the ticket to play in PGA junior tournaments where scouts from the best college teams often recruit . <p> Still , more than 50 junior golfers from his program have participated in National Junior Golf tournaments around the country . And 16 of Walker 's students - including his daughter - have won Atlanta Junior Golf Association college scholarships . Olen Grant , a former graduate of Walker 's program and top golfer at the University of Kentucky , is now trying to qualify for the PGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main goal . Rather , he says , it is exposing inner-city kids to a sport that may be more useful to them in the long run than basketball , football , or baseball . The sport may not have the glitter and speed of other sports , nor the black role models , Walker agrees . But , he says , it is relaxing and a sport of great independence . <p> " You make your own decisions . If the ball is in a bad position , you 'll be the one to select the club and get it out of there . And it feels good to be in a big pretty field in the open and not all closed up " in a gym or in a football uniform , he explains . <p> He says " project kids " are particularly suited to the game . They play well because they have no fear , he says . " They do n't tiptoe around " making decisions . <p> The value of golf skills can not be underestimated as a corporate tool , either , insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation . " Black executives will tell you it makes a difference in a career , " she says . " You ca n't say ' Come on , boss , let 's go play football . ' But you can do it with golf . You get to talk intimately between holes . "
