<p> What is it about travel that turns people into raving cheapskates ? I have nothing against getting a discount ; in fact , my epitaph will probably be , " " She got a cheap fare . " But some tourists seem to spend their entire vacation playing the wayfarer 's version of " " The Price Is Right . " <p> It matters not if a given experience is momentous , breathtaking , romantic , educational - or unpleasant . What matters is the price . <p> Obviously , if you 've got a wandering soul and limited funds , it 's better to go on the proverbial shoestring than not to go at all . But bargain hunters can get obsessive . <p> Last year , for example , my husband Duke and I went to Ecuador , a destination we admittedly chose because an airline was offering a $ 430 round-trip special from Los Angeles to Guayaquil . <p> You paid how much ? <p> The country has to be one of the least expensive places in the Western Hemisphere - we regularly dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 16 and took private Spanish lessons at a Quito school for $ 5 an hour . Still we were called extravagant . <p> " " You paid $ 5 for Spanish ? " scoffed a sun-dried German we met in Banos , a picturesque town with thermal springs and a virgin who is thought to work miracles . " " I only paid $ 3.50 . " <p> I tried not to feel inferior . The language school had been recommended by a friend , we 'd talked our way out of a registration fee and we were n't going to be in town long enough to shop around . Time is money too , I reasoned . <p> The man 's Italian companion asked how much we were paying for our hotel . " " Nine bucks , " Duke said proudly . We had been booked for $ 17 a night at the priciest place in town , the Sangay , but when we entered the lobby , we were overcome by the smell of mildew . <p> My husband , whom no one will ever call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better-located accommodations for half that - at the Flor de Oriente . <p> Too expensive <p> " " Too expensive , " the signorina said . " " I pay $ 4 . With breakfast . " <p> I was tempted to one up ( or one down ) her and say that our price included breakfast , lunch and dinner , plus a chauffeur and car . But it 's a waste of time to compete . There 's always someone paying less . There 's always someone paying more too . <p> " " Do you have hot water ? " I asked . <p> " " I do n't need it , " she said smugly . " " The baths at La Piscina de la Virgen are only 15 cents . " <p> I do n't see the point of going thousands of miles to take a cut-rate shower . Granted , no one has ever accused me of being frugal . I 'd rather part with an extra traveler 's check and get an experience I 'll enjoy . But I would n't tell anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would stop telling me how not to spend mine . <p> Once in Thailand we were trying to get from the northern city of Chiangmai to the ruins of Sukhothai . I wanted to spend $ 35 and fly to the nearby city of Phitsanulok , but Duke found a " " special " package tour . Eighteen dollars bought a five-hour ride on a minibus , a box lunch , a rest stop at a 13th-century wat and a night at a guest house that no guidebook ever mentioned . <p> I was less than enthusiastic , having had few positive Third World bus experiences . " " We can see the countryside , " Duke said . <p> Going on the cheap <p> It 's hard to argue against going on the cheap without opening myself up to charges of being spoiled . <p> I 've spent most of my adult life atoning for my misspent youth , which included Dr. Bernhard 's European Holiday , an unforgettable six-week expedition for teen-age princesses-in-training to Dutch diamond cutters , Parisian parfumeries and Swiss hotels . <p> ( To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York-based Ph.D. , who , along with his wife , escorted groups of girls on deluxe tours of Europe and the United States . ) <p> So I agreed to the Thai package on one condition : if the guest house was a dump , we 'd check into the highly touted $ 20-a-night bungalow resort right outside the ruins the wheel ) , the overcrowded minibus pulled up in front of a dive on a stretch of deserted highway , at least 10 miles away from the archaeological site . <p> It 's paid for <p> " " No , " I said without hesitation . Budget travelers from all over the world regarded me with horror . " " It 's paid for , " they shouted in Spanish , German and Japanese . My husband looked mortified . <p> Then Danielle , a lawyer from Aix-en-Provence , resplendent in fluorescent pink culottes , a matching pink backpack and one-carat diamond stud earrings , asked where we planned to stay . In halting high school French I explained about the resort . She understood instantly and nudged her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it three stars . <p> " " But it 's paid for , " chorused the pikers . Duke and Guy exchanged uneasy shrugs . Meanwhile , Danielle , with enviable aplomb , glided inside , looked around for a nanosecond , then marched purposefully out of the lobby , shaking her expertly coifed head . Both my husband and hers turned on their heels and followed her into a waiting cab . <p> In all fairness , my husband does recognize the difference between inexpensive and a good value . On a recent visit to the great pyramids of Teotihuacan outside Mexico City , he did n't hesitate to spend $ 60 to stay at the Villa Arqueologica , a lovely oasis just a short stroll from the Avenue of the Dead . <p> The expenditure enabled us to explore the magnificently preserved ancient city in the morning before the crowds , and return to watch the sunset from the Pyramid of the Moon . <p> Go to spend it <p> " " You do n't go out of the country to save money , " Duke said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just does n't like to waste it , a concept that is relative . <p> For instance , my husband considered the hotel 's $ 1 charge for a bottle of mineral water to be extortionate , especially since he could purchase the same thing for 20 cents at a depository down the road . The combination of intense heat and high altitude meant we were drinking agua mineral like , well , water . So if he was willing to walk through the lobby with a sack of clanking bottles , I was certainly willing to pretend I did n't know him . <p> On the other hand , I got a little homicidal on the last day of our vacation when he insisted on taking the bottles - about 10 had accumulated - back for a refund . We had to drive back to Mexico City , return our rental car , do a little shopping and catch a plane . " " It will just take a minute , " he said , as he parked on the side of the highway . He knocked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles to a restaurant next door . <p> Ten minutes later he emerged , still carrying the bottles , followed by three young girls . " " The owner is asleep , " Duke explained . " " They 're going to wake him up . " <p> Never a squanderer <p> Duke waited patiently for the depository owner to get dressed . <p> Then he followed him back to the restaurant where the owner got some change . Fifteen minutes later Duke returned triumphantly waving $ 2 - half of which he later accused me of " " squandering " to rent an airport luggage cart ( we had only five bags ) . What makes people so cheap ? I wondered again . <p> In my husband 's case I guess it 's heredity , judging from a letter from my father-in-law that was waiting for us when we returned home . <p> Duke 's father also had just returned from vacation . " " I got to the airport and found out if they filled up the tank on the rental car , it would be $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My plane was leaving in 20 minutes , but I drove out of the airport and got gas somewhere else . Made it back with five minutes to spare . " <p> " " I can understand it , " Duke said . " " But I would n't do it . " " " Lucky thing , " I replied .
