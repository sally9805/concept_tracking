PREFORMATTED TABLE I. INTRODUCTION <p> The problems associated with managing municipal solid waste ( MSW ) 1 in the United States are both environmental and economic . Where to put the ever-increasing garbage has become an important issue at all governmental levels . It is estimated that the total MSW generated in the United States in 1990 was nearly 180 million tons , and that amount is expected to increase ten percent by the year 2000. 2 However , most statistics concerning solid waste seem to be crude guesses and actual amounts may be much higher because the United States Environmental Protection Agency 's ( EPA ) often-used numbers are based on dry waste. 3 Although most of the MSW increase is due to population growth , consumption increase is also important as each person seems to be generating more waste on average. 4 <p> Today , a general consensus has developed among waste management professionals that a hierarchy of waste management options exists that ranges from most to least environmentally protective. 5 This hierarchy includes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This hierarchy reflects the concern for both hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be given a higher position in the hierarchy than use of landfills . Moreover , they often oppose both approaches because of their perceived adverse effects on recycling efforts. 7 In 1990 , EPA claimed its " Agenda for Action " promoted a three-tiered hierarchy  --  source reduction first , recycling second , and incineration/landfilling third. 8 This indicates an EPA tilt against incineration , a significant departure from its 1988 position that seemed to favor incineration over landfills. 9 <p> By 1989 , eighty percent of the MSW was being sent to 6,000 landfills , but half of these sites were expected to close within five years. 10 As a result of ever-increasing amounts of solid waste , declining landfill capacity , stricter legal regulations , and rising costs , there is renewed interest in MSW incineration . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) Subtitle D regulations for MSW landfills require such landfills that receive wastes after October 9 , 1993 ( or April 9 , 1994 , for certain small MSW landfills ) to comply with strict provisions that are both technically and economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attractive option . Currently , about fourteen percent of all MSW is incinerated ( mostly with energy recovery ) , thirteen percent is recycled and nearly everything remaining is sent to landfills. 12 With new regulations for MSW incinerators and the beginning of implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments ( CAA Amendments ) of 1990 , it is time to reexamine the role of incineration in MSW management . <p> This article first describes the current status of MSW management and disposal in the United States . Second , the history , technology , legal regulation , health effects and environmental risks of MSW incineration are addressed . Finally , the article assesses the viability and necessity of MSW incineration within the confines of the hierarchy of currently-available waste management options . The United States must , with some urgency , develop and utilize methods that reduce , recycle , treat , and destroy our growing inventory of MSW . Utilized in conjunction with source reduction and recycling , MSW incineration has the potential to be a viable and needed part of any rational solid waste management program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STATES <p> A. Municipal Solid Waste Management Options  --  The Hierarchy <p> 1 . Waste Prevention/Minimization ( Source Reduction ) <p> The best way to deal with the problems of declining landfill capacity , consumption of virgin materials , and the release to the environment of hazardous materials contained in waste is to prevent the generation of MSW . Significant progress in waste prevention will only be realized when manufacturers change the design and packaging of products to avoid either generation of wastes during production and marketing and/or to overcome disposal problems at the end of the product 's useful life . Waste prevention will also succeed and have a significant impact on MSW reduction when consumers change both their consumption habits as well as their manner of disposing of what they purchase. 13 Waste reduction efforts can be aimed at reducing quantifies and/or toxicities of waste . It can be as simple as reusing an item rather than replacing it , or producing quality products with longer useful lives . To date , even though the EPA must collect and disseminate information on source reduction under the 1990 Pollution Prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen. 14 Waste generated in the United States increases by about one percent a year with about seventy percent of this increase created by population growth. 15 Concomitantly , our ability to manage MSW is declining . <p> Reducing the amount of MSW generated will be difficult . Today , packaging accounts for thirty percent of the volume of MSW , with plastics and paper accounting for half the volume of waste going to landfills. 16 The weight of packaging wastes has been declining as plastics and foam products replace glass and metal , but the total volume of packaging has remained essentially constant. 17 Despite the negative aspects of packaging , it is important to note that it serves important functions . These include decreasing spoilage and preventing pilferage or tampering . Such functions could be compromised by stringent environmental regulation. 18 <p> Some waste reduction measures , however , have minimal down-side risks . The manufacture of some products for which there is minimal need , such as direct mail , oversized newspapers , and some single-use throw away products ( e.g. , styrofoam cups ) , might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper disposal . Also , with approximately twenty percent of MSW comprised of yard wastes , increased home composting could be a useful way to reduce waste. 19 However , whenever the government involves itself in regulating the details of the economy , the resulting impact on employment , tax revenues , and even the environment , is often unpredictable . <p> Moreover , by factoring in the amounts of energy and raw materials that are used and the waste that is generated in the manufacture of " environmentally compatible " products , it is apparent that focusing on waste disposal ( such as the production of degradable plastics ) may not achieve much environmental improvement . <p> A major problem with MSW is that neither the manufacturer nor the purchaser bear the disposal cost associated with the toxic materials found in these wastes . For example , three toxic heavy metals  --  cadmium , lead , and mercury  --  are pervasively used in consumer products. 20 Cadmium is primarily used for coating and plating ; it is also found in batteries and in plastics. 21 Mercury is used in batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries , but it is also used in electronic products and in plastics. 23 Toxic organic chemicals are found in substances such as inks , particle board , glue , and cleaners. 24 More than one hundred toxic substances that are classified as hazardous under RCRA are found in common household products. 25 Only rarely are substances banned in consumer products . One example of a ban was the limited chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) ban imposed by the Food and Drug Administration in 1978. 26 Other than this , few direct controls on hazardous substances in potential wastes exist . Concern for tort liability , employee protection , and the need to meet Clean Air Act ( CAA ) emission limitations during manufacturing processes are examples of indirect pressures to reduce the amount of toxic substances in the waste stream . <p> A number of state statutes attempt to limit hazardous waste generation . For example , California 's " Proposition 65 " requires manufacturers to prove that substances used in products are not toxic. 27 Effective labeling or other communication concerning the toxicity of products would assist consumers who desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mandate these actions , however . Instead , laws often work to create barriers to pollution prevention. 28 <p> Reducing quantities of MSW will be difficult . Packaging wastes , which make up thirty percent of MSW by weight , are often singled out as a prime target for waste reduction efforts . Market forces encourage manufacturers to minimize packaging wastes , at least by weight , because of shipping and handling costs . Legal efforts to force reductions in packaging wastes can result in products with higher manufacturing environmental problems , increased product waste ( e.g. , food spoilage ) , or other problems . Moreover , the wastes generated from " ready-to-eat " and " fast-food " packaging are a part of the U.S. consumers ' entrenched life-style . Changes in solid waste generation require consumer behavior modification that will not come easily. 29 At this time , although EPA is working to disseminate ideas and structure incentives for waste minimization , we have no meaningful legal regime to reduce the generation of MSW. 30 Ultimately , the major push in this direction will come from the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manufacturing process . <p> 2 . Recycling <p> Recycling consists of : ( 1 ) collecting secondary materials ; ( 2 ) preparing the materials for market ; and ( 3 ) manufacturing new products from the recycled material. 31 The amount of recycling in the United States is frequently estimated at ten percent. 32 This is a crude estimate , though , and it varies greatly depending on the way in which MSW is defined . MSW is typically considered to include residential , commercial , and industrial waste. 33 But , construction demolition waste ( i.e. , bulky waste ) , for example , may or may not be included in the reported figures . There is also some question as to what is included in the concept of recycling : is waste that is produced during an intermediate stage of processing , and then returned to basic production , considered recycled waste ? Regardless of how waste recycling statistics are developed , there is little doubt that U.S. recycling efforts are low in comparison with countries such as Japan. 34 <p> Recycling efforts are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , known as " cullet " in the glass manufacturing industry , increased from 24,000 tons a year in 1970 to more than one million tons in 1987. 35 Paper and paperboard recycling has increased to 28.5 percent or 22.6 percent , with the higher number including pre-consumer waste. 36 Aluminum has one of the highest rates of recycling  --  about forty-three percent says the Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) and more than fifty percent according to the National Solid Waste Management Association ( NSWMA ) . 37 Municipal and business waste recycling efforts are helping to increase the recycling of ferrous metals , plastics , and yard wastes , although the data may lack reliability. 38 <p> MSW can be collected as mixed waste , or , to facilitate the recycling of various materials found in waste streams , separation can be required prior to collection . Wastes can also be separated at Materials Recovery Facilities ( MRFs ) . About twelve MRFs were in operation in the United States in mid-1989 , and more are planned. 39 However , facilities that separate wastes have both high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970s , they generally performed poorly . The facilities built during the 1980s appear more successful . In some MRFs , waste that is not recycled is converted to refuse-derived fuel ( RDF ) . The RDF is then burned to produce electricity or steam. 41 <p> Recycling increases the useful life of MSW landfills , reduces the need for virgin materials to produce new products , and saves energy resources . More significantly , recycling means source reduction which protects against the adverse health and environmental effects of improper MSW disposal ; what is not generated harms no one . Recycling facilities , however , can become major hazardous waste sites . It is claimed that fifty of the worst sites on the Superfund National Priorities List ( NPL ) are recycling facilities and twenty percent of the 1,211 NPL sites were created from the disposal of recycling residues or from recycling practices. 42 <p> Recycling potential varies among products in the waste stream , and the technology used for recycling depends , of course , on the desired end product. 43 EPA set a goal of reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty percent in 1996. 44 The twenty-five percent reduction level has already been achieved by a number of cities , but such a goal is unlikely to be reached for the United States. 45 <p> EPA has an " Agenda for Action " to encourage recycling that includes the implementation of existing federal procurement guidelines and the development of recycling programs by federal agencies. 46 EPA is also looking for ways to stimulate markets for secondary materials and recycled goods . For example , EPA was concerned with the recycling of lead-acid batteries . As discussed below , 47 EPA took the position that material separation is part of the best demonstrated technology for MSW incineration , but because of White House pressure EPA did not include such requirements in the final regulation. 48 EPA developed draft legislation that would promote pollution prevention and recycling. 49 The aim was to reduce per capita waste generation by ten percent within ten years and to recycle at least twenty-five percent of the solid waste generated within ten years and fifty percent within ten years of enactment . Since the draft bill only set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tentative first step. 50 It did not remove the need for dealing with extant MSW in a meaningful way . Expecting recycling to eliminate most of our wastes is akin to believing in perpetual motion machines. 51 In addition , EPA speaks with two voices on recycling because it considers materials to be hazardous if they are reprocessed off the original production site unless they are used immediately and directly as part of a new product. 52 <p> Perhaps the most significant barrier to MSW recycling is that the value of the material produced is less than the cost to process the waste . A 1992 study found the average cost of processing a ton of recyclables is $50.30 , which is more than the value of the material recovered at an MRF. 53 <p> 3 . Landfill Disposal <p> Historically , landfilling has been the most common disposal method in the United States , with an estimated eighty percent ( about 130 million tons ) of the MSW disposed in approximately 10,000 landfills in 1986.54 However , many areas of the country are experiencing shortfalls of permitted landfill capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent environmental protection requirements. 55 EPA estimated that between 1978 and 1988 , seventy percent of the landfills , more than 14,000 , closed. 56 By 1990 , solid waste produced in the United States increased to 180 million tons , but MSW landfills had decreased to less than 6,000 , and half of them were expected to close within five years. 57 New landfills can rarely be sited because of intense political opposition by people living near the proposed facility. 58 Known as the NIMBY ( " not in my back yard " ) or LULU ( " locally unwanted land use " ) phenomenons , this opposition has resulted in a nationwide gridlock on the siting of new facilities. 59 Such opposition is not entirely irrational given the record of disposal sites that have created environmental problems. 60 A survey of 951 disposal sites on EPA 's NPL showed evidence of metals migrating at thirty-four percent of the sites and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) migrating from twenty-eight percent of the sites. 61 At about seventy-five percent of these sites , there was groundwater contamination. 62 The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with a waste disposal problem that will not disappear. 63 While the public demands state and local governments solve waste disposal problems , they simultaneously organize to block proposed solutions . Indeed , the opposition to any proposed environmental solution has led to a new acronym , NOPE  --  " Not On Planet Earth "  --  which has become the rallying cry of opponents to waste disposal facilities. 64 The latest in public response is termed BANANA  --  " Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything . " 65 <p> The states , under pressure from their constituents , also act to block interstate movement of waste as existing facilities reach capacity. 66 For example , over the past thirty years New York City closed five major landfills and nine incinerators in New York City . The city now relies on three aging incinerators and one landfill . Numerous environmental groups oppose a proposed expansion of incineration capacity. 67 The necessary but increasingly restrictive legal constraints being placed on all forms of waste disposal exacerbate the management problem. 68 Even if recycling and incineration gain favor and eventually dominate MSW management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash derived from incinerator operations . Thus , the need for new landfills will become more acute as existing facilities are retired . More facilities can be expected to close before the new RCRA Subtitle D regulations announced September 11 , 1991 come into full effect in October , 1993 ( or April 1994 for certain small MSW landfills ) . 69 The EPA estimates that the cost increase from Subtitle D standards to local governments will be approximately $1.5 billion in annualized costs by the year 2000. 70 <p> The RCRA Subtitle D regulations establish minimum criteria for all MSW landfills and apply to owners/operators of new MSW landfills , existing MSW landfills , and lateral expansions ( although not all of the requirements apply in all situations ) . 71 " The new regulations specifically deal with location restrictions , facility design and operations , groundwater monitoring and corrective action measures , conditions for closure and post-closure care , and financial responsibility requirements . " 72 MSW landfills must comply with the majority of the requirements by October 9 , 1993 ( or April 9 , 1994 for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring , and corrective action requirements will be phased in over time. 73 <p> More specifically , the new regulations restrict the siting of landfills near airports , wetlands , flood plains and fault areas . To be sited , a landfill must either satisfy the requirements of an EPA-approved state permit program or have a composite liner made of synthetic material covering a two-foot clay liner . The landfill must be covered daily and must have methane gas monitors , storm water controls , and programs to prevent hazardous wastes from entering the landfill . Within five years of the rule 's publication , all landfills must have groundwater monitors . There are also closure and post-closure requirements that impose technical and financial responsibilities for thirty years after closure. 74 <p> As many of the MSW landfills in the United States approach capacity , tough choices must be made before the critical date of October 9 , 1993 ( or April 9 , 1994 , for certain small MSW landfills ) . There are a limited number of options : ( 1 ) an existing landfill can remain open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to increase capacity ; ( 2 ) a landfill can be closed , and the municipality can set up a transfer station ; or ( 3 ) a landfill can be closed , and the municipality can contract with private haulers to transport MSW directly out of the municipality. 75 Given these options , a municipality should conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether its landfill should remain open . The costs of compliance with these regulations can be prohibitive . Thus , even if a municipality desires to operate its MSW landfill after October 9 , 1993 ( or April 9 , 1994 , for certain small MSW landfills ) , the landfill may not be able to comply with the strict groundwater monitoring and corrective action provisions of the new regulations and may be forced to close. 76 Given the technical and economic burden associated with keeping MSW landfills open , the landfill capacity in the United States is certainly likely to shrink in response to these strict requirements governing their operation . Clearly , we must consider other options for handling our MSW . <p> The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incineration , increasingly attractive . The adverse by-products of incineration are often destroyed or neutralized relatively quickly by natural forces , but the toxic potential of landfills can last indefinitely . Moreover , CERCLA liability or exposure associated with land disposal can stretch indefinitely into the future even if all requirements under RCRA have been met. 77 <p> 4 . Incineration <p> Incineration should occupy a position in the hierarchy of solid waste disposal options that makes it less desirable than waste prevention/minimization and recycling but more desirable than landfill disposal . It is a permanent solution in that it destroys wastes and can be coupled with energy recovery . Incineration reduces volume by greater than ninety percent , thus requiring far less space in landfills . It does , however , produce potential environmental releases of toxic metals and organics from ash residues. 78 It also results in the production of numerous air pollutants including particulate matter containing metals , organics ( dioxins and furans ) , acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid , and nitrogen oxides. 79 <p> As mentioned above , during the 1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the stricter legal regulations and rising costs of all solid waste management options led to a renewed interest in use of the MSW incineration option . The NSWMA reports that 136 waste-to-energy plants are operating in thirty-six states and are managing nearly twenty-nine million of the estimated 185 tons of trash generated each year in the United States . This represents about sixteen percent of our trash and the percentage should increase with the addition of nearly one hundred plants that are in the planning , construction or permitting stage. 80 At the same time , organized opposition by citizens and environmentalists makes siting new facilities difficult . With new regulations for MSW incinerators and the implementation of the CAA Amendments of 1990 , it is now appropriate to revisit the option of MSW incineration. 81 III . MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE INCINERATION A. History <p> The modern U.S. city emerged between 1860 and 1910 . During this fifty year period , the U.S. population increased from thirty-one million to ninety-one million . However , solid waste management did not keep pace with population growth . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advent of the automobile , the major contributor to MSW was animals . One thousand horses can discharge 500 gallons of urine and ten tons of manure in an eight-hour work day. 82 During the 1866 cholera epidemic , New York City authorities removed some 160,000 tons of manure from vacant lots. 83 In 1914 it was reported that 82,000 horses , cows , and mules in Chicago produced 600,000 tons of dung per year. 84 In the nineteenth century , pigs freely roamed the streets of New York City feeding on garbage. 85 The practice of using hogs to consume MSW remained common until the mid-1950s . In 1941 , a federal study of cities with populations greater than 25,000 reported that an estimated twenty-seven percent of their garbage was fed to swine. 86 <p> As the solid waste accumulated across the United States , coastal cities began to dump much of it into the ocean . Today , such practices are unacceptable and almost completely legally phased out. 87 Most of the waste , however , went to open dumps where typically it was burned . Extensive dumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn for months , often blanketing the region with an odoriferous smoke cloud for days at a time . Occasionally the legal system got involved in a public or private nuisance suit88 or in enforcing a local ordinance , 89 but this was the exception . During the 1960s , the limited federal efforts in the solid waste field focused on converting dumps into sanitary landfills . Sanitary landfills , with each day 's waste contained in cells surrounded and covered by dirt , would keep MSW from burning. 90 When the CAA of 1970 was enacted , it essentially banned uncontrolled burning , thereby leading to a renewed interest in the construction of incinerators by local governments. 91 An incinerator 's major advantage is that it reduces solid waste seventy to eighty-five percent by weight and eighty-five to ninety-five percent by volume. 92 The heat value of MSW offers the possibility of converting waste to usable energy . Incineration also destroys pathogens and some toxic chemicals , but , as a trade-off , produces harmful air emissions . However , compared with many of the alternatives , the risks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major method of MSW management , its use dates back to the nineteenth century . The first municipal incinerator was constructed in Allegheny , Pennsylvania in 1885 , and other cities soon followed by building " crematories " for their MSW. 93 During the 1890s , Washington , D.C. operated an incinerator during the winter months in lieu of barging MSW down the Potomac River to a site south of Alexandria , Virginia. 94 In 1924 , Atlanta , Georgia sold surplus steam produced by an incinerator to the Atlanta Gas Light Company. 95 A second incinerator built in 1927 also produced steam that was sold to the Georgia Power Company. 96 During the late 1930s , the number of MSW incinerators in the United States declined substantially with most MSW ending up in landfills. 97 As more stringent regulations began to be placed on MSW disposal practices during the 1970s , interest in incineration was rekindled . In 1989 , EPA claimed that more than 200 MSW incinerators were in operation , 98 with 136 of these facilities being waste-to-energy plants. 99 <p> Incinerator facilities are not evenly distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in descending order , in Florida , New York , Massachusetts , Ohio , and Virginia. 100 More than forty percent of the MSW incinerators are located in New England and the mid-Atlantic regions combined ; few are located in the Rocky Mountains or further west. 101 Today , well-designed and well-operated incinerators may offer a viable solution to some of the MSW disposal problems. 102 However , while improved technology has removed most of the nuisance problems associated with incineration , public opposition has made siting new facilities extremely difficult. 103 B. Incineration Technology <p> Three types of incinerators are commonly used to burn MSW : mass burn , modular , and refuse-derived fuel ( RDF ) MSW incinerators. 104 Mass burn MSW incinerators vary widely in size , ranging from 50 to 1000 tons per day capacity. 105 Typically each plant has two or three incinerators . In a mass burn incinerator , wastes are burned without preprocessing , except to remove very large items such as washing machines. 106 In a mass burn system , hydraulic rams or pusher grate section s are used to move MSW into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern mass burn incinerators often have waterwalls to cool the combustion chamber and to recover heat. 108 Older mass burn incinerators may have a refractory wall design and may lack the capability of recovering heat. 109 <p> Modular MSW incinerator systems are typically small , ranging from 5 to 120 tons per day of burning capacity and having one to four incinerators at each site. 110 Modular incinerators usually use two or more combustion chambers to provide better combustion . The configuration of these chambers and how much air is introduced allows for various classifications of modular incinerators . Most of these devices have refractory-lined combustion chambers. 111 Some recently constructed modular incinerators recover heat using waste heat boilers , but the older incinerators do not. 112 These incinerators usually do not preprocess wastes but accept all wastes that can be physically handled by the system. 113 <p> Refuse-derived fuel ( RDF ) incinerators burn pretreated and shredded MSW. 114 The processing stage varies from merely removing large items and shredding , to extensive pretreatment that produces a finely divided fuel with minimal noncombustible material. 115 The RDF is usually fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grate . Some facilities mix auxiliary fuel with the waste for better combustion . RDF incinerators are usually medium to large ; they typically recover heat ; 116 and they have a burning capacity ranging from 300 to 1000 tons per day . Plants typically have two to four incinerators at a site . One drawback to RDF facilities is that they emit twice the quantity of dioxins and furans as mass burn facilities. 117 <p> There are about a dozen old MSW incinerators in the United States that utilize other technologies , including batch-fed refractory wall incinerators , small modular systems that burn unprocessed MSW , and other technology systems including pyrolysis , and fluidized bed. 118 New incinerators normally use one of the three major technology systems described above. 119 <p> Both mass burn and RDF incinerator systems can be designed to recover heat . These waste-to-energy systems are able to produce steam or electricity . The construction of such energy-recovery facilities has been encouraged by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act ( PURPA ) 120 which requires electric utilities to purchase this electric power at the price they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attractive to independent power producers. 121 <p> In 1990 , 128 waste-to-energy incinerators , operating in thirty-six states , had the capacity to burn 84,246 tons per day . There are twelve plants that can process 6,040 tons per day to produce RDF that can then be burned at other facilities. 122 These facilities produce electric power equivalent to nearly twenty-seven million barrels of oil each year . There are seventy-one planned MSW incinerators and eight inactive facilities that are expected to become operational soon. 123 Thus , incineration could be a partial solution to the MSW problem and reduce petroleum consumption if public opposition ( i.e. , the NIMBY syndrome ) could be overcome. 124 <p> Public opposition usually involves the following : concern with health and environmental risks from air emissions and ash disposal ; a perceived negative effect on recycling efforts ; a belief that the people living in the vicinity of the facility are not beneficiaries of the facility ; a concern as to the quality of the operation of the facility ; the concern over adverse impacts on property values ; and contentions that sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these NIMBY issues are similar to those that have gridlocked local governmental efforts to provide other services to their communities . The siting of other MSW management facilities as well as prisons , half-way houses , drug treatment centers , mental health centers , and other facilities has been similarly thwarted. 126 The concern that incineration destroys efforts at source reduction means that some environmentalists will oppose incineration regardless of its comparative safety. 127 <p> Opposition is also strengthened by our incomplete knowledge of incinerator effects and the impossible standards often being imposed on governmental officials . In addition , citizens distrust government and believe that incinerators will be improperly operated . Unfortunately , citizen concern over incineration is not entirely irrational given the track record of governmental supervision . The public cries for a " no risk " standard to be imposed on incinerators . This demand for absolute protection from the effects of hazardous materials is not usually imposed on other activities . <p> To burn MSW effectively , an incinerator must meet the appropriate " three Ts " of incineration for the material being burned : adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSW , this means about a one-to-two second residence time for flue gases in the combustion zone , although , with adequate turbulence , combustion is almost instantaneous if the temperature is sufficient. 129 The minimum temperature for mass burn and RDF incineration systems is 1,800 dgrees F.130 Higher temperatures produce substantial oxides of nitrogen ( NO X ) emissions and can volatilize metals . Lower temperatures decrease these problems but increase the emission of products of incomplete combustion ( PICs ) . 131 High temperatures are also needed to destroy organic compounds such as dioxins , but these compounds can still be formed during and after combustion as reactions continue in the hot flue gases . To minimize these environmental problems , MSW incinerators must ensure adequate mixing of heterogeneous wastes to achieve adequate combustion . They also must ensure sufficient heat value in the waste either through such mixing or through the use of auxiliary fuel to create the conditions for complete burning. 132 <p> Air emissions from incinerators contain many substances because of the various wastes burned in the systems . Older incinerators tend to have high emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lower emissions . State-of-the art pollution controls can further limit emissions . <p> Incinerators emit particulate matter ( PM ) . While some PM is noncombustible material from the original waste input , some is condensed gases from material vaporized during incineration but cooled into or onto particles . Particulates can be silicates from glass , inorganic oxides , and metals . The metals commonly found as particulates include iron , aluminum , and cadmium . Other toxic trace metals may also be present. 133 <p> In addition , organic compounds ( including dioxins and furans ) and trace heavy metals can be absorbed onto PM and be emitted. 134 Heavy metals such as zinc , lead , cadmium , mercury , and arsenic volatilize in elemental form , although mercury is often present as mercury chloride . As flue gases cool , the metals condense onto fly ash135 or join together to form a material known as fume . The distribution of metals in relation to the size of the fly ash particle varies by the type of metal . Most metals are found on particles less than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are the most serious air pollutants , as they can enter the respiratory system easily . The larger particles also pose health risks through transfer in foodchain pathways as well as by direct ingestion following inhalation. 136 <p> Nitrogen oxides ( NO X ) are produced during MSW incineration by the conversion of nitrogen compounds in wastes and by reactions at high temperatures with nitrogen and oxygen in the air , that produce NO X by thermal fixation. 137 Since MSW incinerators usually operate at about 1,800 degrees F , which is below the temperature of significant NO X production , most NO X is created by conversion . Yard and food wastes are the major contributors to NO X formation. 138 <p> Acid gases are emitted from incinerators as a function of the elements of chlorine , sulfur , bromine , and fluorine in the MSW inputs . The most significant acid gas is usually hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) which is produced from incineration of PVCs and other chlorine containing materials . Other acid gases produced during MSW incineration include sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen fluoride . Sulfur emissions from MSW incinerators , however , tend to be lower than other sources of air pollution that burn oil or coal. 139 <p> The air pollutants that are the subject of the most controversy are the seventy-five chemical compounds known as chlorinated dioxins ( dibenzo-p-dioxins , or PCDDs ) and 135 chlorinated furans ( dibenzofurans , or PCDFs ) .14 degrees . These are the toxics of greatest concern among the many organic chemicals found in trace amounts in MSW incinerator emissions . Dioxin is the term frequently used as shorthand for the seventy-five PCDDs , but it is also used to designate 2,3,7,8-TCDD , the most harmful form of the dioxin chemicals . Dioxins in MSW occur in products such as plastics , bleached paper , pesticides , and wood preservatives. 141 Dioxins can also be formed during combustion by either direct conversion of precursor chemicals or combustion of nonprecursor organic compounds with a chlorine donor . In addition , dioxins can be formed after combustion , when fly ash particles act to convert undestroyed precursors into dioxins/furans. 142 MSW incinerators are usually considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because MSW fly ash usually has a higher concentration of organic compounds and less effective combustion and air pollution control systems. 144 <p> Pollutants in flue gases can be controlled by : removing materials from MSW prior to combustion ; destroying them at high temperatures ; keeping them from being created by controlling combustion parameters ; or removing them from flue gases using modern pollution control equipment . <p> The effect of material separation on emissions is obviously related to what is separated out prior to incineration . For example , presorting to remove metals has been shown to significantly reduce metal emissions. 145 Removing household and automobile batteries can significantly reduce lead , mercury , and cadmium from emissions. 146 Removing chlorine donors to prevent dioxin and furan formation can not be realistically achieved at this time . Nevertheless , eliminating plastics can help and would also reduce emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) . 147 <p> Because dioxins and furans condense onto fly ash , they are removed by air pollution controls that remove particulate matter . RCRA " dioxin rules " require that incinerators show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some facilities have achieved even more effective removal . However , little information exists concerning removal efficiencies over long time periods . Also , there is scant information on the amounts of dioxin emitted from poorly operated facilities. 149 <p> Removing yard wastes prior to combustion would aid NO X control for MSW incineration. 150 Composting yard wastes would benefit the environment. 151 NO X control during combustion can be accomplished by combustion modification , including flue gas recirculation . NO X can also be reduced after combustion by selective catalytic reduction and by ammonia injection. 152 NO X is difficult to control , and a full discussion of this subject is beyond the scope of this paper . However , NO X formation from MSW incinerators is minor compared with that emitted from electric power plants , heavy industrial boilers , or automobiles. 158 <p> Acid gases can be controlled with " scrubbers " which use alkaline reagents that react with the flue gases to produce salts . These salts are collected and sent to landfills for disposal . Scrubbers vary in design ; they can be wet , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove about ninety-five percent of the HCl and eighty-five percent of the SO 2 , but they have been considered an experimental technology in the United States and , therefore , are not legally a best demonstrated technology ( BDT ) . 154 Dry scrubbers use more lime than wet scrubbers , which presents a solid waste disposal problem , but dry scrubbers do not produce contaminated wastewater . They remove about ninety percent of the HCl and seventy percent of the SO 2 . Spray dry scrubbers have achieved even higher removal efficiencies . Dry injection is another technology that is used extensively in Japan but has not been used in the United States. 155 <p> Particulate matter can be removed from flue gases using electrostatic precipitators ( ESPs ) and fabric filters . Removal efficiencies for the best ESPs can exceed 99.7 percent . Fabric filters or baghouses use a series of cylindrical bags through which the flue gases are filtered . Removal efficiencies can exceed 99.99 percent . Fabric filters are considered more efficient than ESPs in collecting particles smaller than two microns , but either approach can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metals in incinerator emissions condense onto fly ash particles , metal removal of over ninety-nine percent can be achieved for most metals with ESPs and fabric filters . However , mercury and mercury chloride emissions are difficult to remove and are more effectively controlled with scrubbers than with ESPs. 157 One problem with controlling metals , as well as other toxics produced in incinerator gases , is that their concentration is so low that it is often at or below the detection limits of existing instrumentation. 158 C. Regulation Prior To The 1990 CAA Amendments <p> 1 . Overview <p> The regulation of MSW incinerators ( a.k.a. municipal waste combustors ( MWCs ) ) began with the promulgation in 1974159 of new source performance standards ( NSPS ) for PM emissions from MSW incinerators with more than fifty tons per day capacity under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act ( CAA ) . 160 Maximum emissions were limited to 0.08 grains of PM per dry standard cubic foot ( dscf ) of exhaust gas. 161 <p> MSW incinerators are facilities used to burn more than fifty percent household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some industrial sources that do not burn industrial process wastes or medical wastes . MSW incinerators include those that burn refuse-derived fuel ( RDF ) , which is solid waste that is shredded and classified by size before combustion. 162 Hazardous waste incinerators are not covered by the MSW regulations ; instead , they are regulated under RCRA. 163 Sewage sludge , which is incinerated , is regulated by a NSPS164 under the CAA and by regulations under the Clean Water Act ( CWA ) . 165 Medical waste incineration will be regulated under a separate regulation which has a statutory deadline of November 15 , 1992 but has not yet been promulgated. 166 Ocean incineration of wastes is neither done in U.S. waters , nor allowed under U.S. law. 167 <p> In 1986 , standards for new large industrial boilers were promulgated that included a PM standard of 0.1 pounds per million BTU ( which is approximately 0.03 grains per dry standard cubic foot of stack gas ( gr/dscf ) ) . MSW incinerators with heat recovery facilities , that are equipped with boilers and heat recovery incinerators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to fall under the industrial boiler standard . Therefore , some new MSW incinerators were subject to the more stringent 1986 regulations. 168 <p> In addition , mercury has been subject to an ambient air guideline of 1 ug/m3 under CAA section 112169 and lead is subject to an ambient air quality standard under CAA section s 108-110. 170 The criteria pollutants , 171 PM 10 , SO 2 , CO , 0 3 and NO 2 are also subject to regulation under the applicable state implementation plan ( SIP ) 172 which , since 1977 , also includes requirements applicable to areas meeting ambient air quality standards173 and requirements imposed on nonattainment areas. 174 <p> In section 102 of the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments ( HSWA ) of RCRA , Congress directed EPA to study dioxin risks from MWCs. 175 In June , 1985 , the Administrator announced EPA 's air toxic strategy . It was to include studying MSW incinerators that emit multiple pollutants . On August 5 , 1986 , the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) and the states of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPA to regulate air emissions from new and existing MSW incinerators using the CAA section s 111 and 112 . On July 7 , 1987 , EPA announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking ( ANPRM ) to regulate emissions from new or modified MSW incinerators as well as from existing sources. 176 Proposed rules for both existing and new MSW incinerators were promulgated December 20 , 1989. 177 Existing facilities could also be regulated by the states as part of the SIP development178 and might be subject to the nonattainment area provisions. 179 EPA issued guidance documents as to what is the appropriate technology  --  usually referred to as " best demonstrated technology " or BDT. 180 New sources were required to incorporate gas scrubbers , combustion controls , and particulate controls . <p> Some states specifically regulate MSW incinerators . For example , Connecticut , Florida , Indiana , Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Vermont , and Wisconsin require scrubbers . Some states also specify combustion and particulate controls , and some have adopted minimum operating standards. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSW incinerators . Other states such as California , Connecticut , New Jersey , and New York require " best available control technology " ( BACT ) for NO X control. 182 About ten states have HCl limits requiring ninety percent removal or emission limits of thirty to fifty parts per million ( ppm ) . Some states impose SO 2 removal efficiency requirements , usually seventy to eighty percent , and some set emission limits , usually thirty to one hundred ppm. 183 For particulates , the federal standard was 0.046 gr/dscf , but states vary in their requirements and several states have set limits as low as 0.01 gr/dscf . Few states have set particulate emission standards for metals. 184 The federal regulations created in the 1970s and 1980s for MSW incinerators only regulated particulates generally. 185 These regulations ignored the more specific metal particulates emitted by MSW incinerators , even though controlling particulates in general helps to control specific pollutants emitted as solids . <p> The legal status of MSW incinerator ash186 has been unclear and , as a result , has retarded further use of incineration technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household waste exclusion " to exempt MSW incinerators from being regulated as RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste treatment facilities. 187 Although incinerator ash was not listed as a hazardous waste , it nevertheless qualified as hazardous if it satisfied any of the four " hazardous characteristics " specified by federal law ; 188 namely , ignitability , corrosivity , reactivity , or toxicity. 189 <p> In 1984 , Congress amended RCRA to exclude from Subtitle C all waste-to-energy facilities that have a program to exclude hazardous waste inputs. 190 However , Congress did not specify how ash from MSW incinerators should be characterized . In 1985 , EPA stated that ash would be considered hazardous if it failed an extraction procedure ( EP ) toxicity test. 191 However , ash can vary daily in its toxic characteristics . Some reported data gathered from MSW incinerators indicates that fly ash failed EPA 's EP toxicity test every time because of high lead and cadmium levels . Also bottom ash , both alone and combined with fly ash , failed the EP toxicity test twenty-five to fifty percent of the time. 192 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines under Subtitle D for managing ash are ill-developed. 193 In 1988 , EPA announced it would not provide further guidance on ash treatment until it received directions from Congress. 194 <p> In late 1989 , the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) lost cases before the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York195 and the Northern District of Illinois. 196 The Illinois case held that ash remaining after incineration of household waste and non-hazardous commercial waste is exempt from hazardous waste regulation. 197 The New York case held that incinerator ash may be exempt from hazardous waste regulation even when tests show it to be toxic. 198 EDF appealed the New York decision and lost again . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that ash produced from an exempted facility was not hazardous waste even if it was hazardous under EPA standards. 199 It also ruled that the 1990 CAA had not made the dispute moot. 200 The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the decision. 201 But only days earlier , on November 19 , 1991 , the U.S. Court of Appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated as hazardous waste. 202 The City of Chicago announced that it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 203 It filed a petition for review on February 18 , 1992. 204 This issue was not resolved by the CAA Amendments . The Senate 's CAA Amendments ( S. 1630 ) allowed incinerator ash to be treated as non-hazardous waste. 205 In the House of Representatives , the subject was considered by the Energy &; Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Material to be part of the RCRA amendments ( H.R. 2162 ) . 206 EPA was under pressure to make a decision without waiting for Congress to act , 207 but it did not act . In March , 1990 , an EPA-sponsored study determined that municipal ash was not hazardous ; 208 however , that study was immediately attacked by those on both sides of the issue because the study found that ash flunked EPA 's hazardous waste test , even though ash leachate was close to drinking water standards. 209 Congress should have acted to resolve this issue but it did not. 210 The CAA Amendments of 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to section 3001 of RCRA for a two-year period after which the CAA moratorium should not be construed to affect any action the Administrator of EPA may take. 211 Resolution of the ash issue was expected to come in the RCRA reauthorization legislation . Both the Senate and the House reauthorization bills , S. 976 and H.R. 3865 , provide for ash to be managed more stringently than under existing law , but without imposing RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste requirements. 212 But as 1992 ended , RCRA reauthorization had not occurred . As a result , because the decision to select an incinerator option is heavily influenced by the costs of ash disposal , CAA Amendments section 306 discouraged the use of MSW incinerators. 213 <p> Labeling MSW incinerator ash as hazardous waste has major economic implications for industry and for municipalities that own or utilize MSW incinerators . Stringent regulations governing the transport , storage , treatment , and disposal of hazardous waste make such wastes more expensive to manage than non-hazardous waste. 214 Should MSW incinerator ash fall under the legal constraints of hazardous waste , the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be severely reduced or even eliminated. 215 <p> Thus , the economic consequences of classifying MSW incinerator ash as hazardous waste significantly affects the decision to use an incinerator . The tipping fees , which are the charges imposed for dumping ash at landfills , would increase substantially if incinerator ash had to be treated as hazardous waste . <p> An interesting issue is the legal status of incinerator ash dumped in a land facility even if the ash is deemed non-hazardous under RCRA . If the landfill leaks in the future , CERCLA liability may attach to any generator who sent material that included any hazardous substance. 216 Since CERCLA 's universe of hazardous substances is larger than the RCRA universe of hazardous waste , and since RCRA exempts many hazardous substances from its full hazardous waste regulatory program , a person exempt under RCRA can not be certain of also being exempt from CERCLA-based liability in the future . <p> The ramifications of treating ash as hazardous waste may also be seen as shifting the priority determinations regarding the other levels in the MSW management hierarchy . If MSW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other options  --  such as source reduction and recycling , which offer better environmental protection-would become increasingly attractive to industry from a purely economic standpoint . Whether the concomitant environmental improvement would justify the cost to industry remains questionable . <p> However , these other options of managing MSW should not be considered as solely separate and distinct from the incineration option . Rather , source reduction and recycling can complement MSW incineration by not only reducing the amount of MSW , but , by targeting specific items such as batteries that contain toxics , they can also reduce or even eliminate the creation of hazardous ash. 217 <p> In a memorandum to Regional Administrators on September 18 , 1992 , EPA Administrator William Reilly announced a new policy based on RCRA section 3001(i) that ash generated from burning non-hazardous MSW at resource recovery facilities or MWCs is non-hazardous waste regulated under RCRA Subtitle C.218 This policy was prompted by a U.S. Supreme Court request for a federal government interpretation of RCRA 's ash provisions as the Court was reviewing the City of Chicago 's petition for certiorari that was subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the U.S. Supreme Court in Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund vacated a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that required incinerator ash to be considered hazardous waste if it failed an EPA toxicity test . The case was remanded to the Seventh Circuit to make a new decision. 220 In November , 1992 , the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal and sent the case back to the Seventh Circuit. 221 On January 12 , 1993 , the Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its previous holding that municipal waste combustion ash should be classified as hazardous waste if it fails EPA 's toxicity test. 222 Finally , on June 21 , 1993 , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to face , for the second time , the issue of whether ash generated by a MSW incinerator is subject to RCRA regulation if it exhibits hazardous characteristics. 223 <p> 2 . The 1989 Proposed Guidelines <p> The EPA proposed control guidelines for emissions from existing and new MSW incinerators on December 20 , 1989. 224 The guidelines for existing MSW incinerators were to implement CAA section 111(d)225 based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or contribute significantly to , air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare . " 226 MSW incinerators were not regulated under CAA section 112 because the emissions were not considered hazardous as that term is used in that section . MSW incinerators were not regulated under CAA section s 108-110 because the emissions are not emitted from " numerous or diverse " sources as required by section 108 . When final section 111(d) guidelines were promulgated , the states would have nine months to submit a plan using procedures similar to those for submitting implementation plans under section 110 . These EPA guidelines specified the best system of emission reduction that the states were required to include in their plans . The states could impose more stringent standards , based on CAA section 116 , 227 because EPA guidelines , which require the consideration of costs , non-air quality health and environmental impacts , and energy requirements , are limited in stringency . <p> The EPA follows a protocol for developing emission guidelines for existing sources . The elements generally are : PREFORMATTED TABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated technology ( BDT ) as discussed below. 229 <p> For regulatory purposes , MSW incinerator emissions can be placed in three classes : organics , metals , and acid gases . Organics are regulated by limits on dioxin/furan emissions and by operational guidelines for CO , load limits , flue gas temperature limitations , and MWC operator training . Metals are controlled by limits on particulate matter ( PM ) because trace metals condense on PM . Acid gases are controlled by emission limits on sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) . <p> 3 . Best Demonstrated Technology <p> The 1989 proposed guidelines divided MWC plants into three size categories with increasing stringency of air pollution controls being required. 230 Small plants were those that combusted up to 250 tons per day ; large plants were those that combusted up to 2,200 tons per day ; and regional plants were those burning more than 2,200 tons per day . In the 1991 guidelines , the definitions changed so that large plants are those between 250 tons per day and 1,100 tons per day while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day. 231 For small MSW incinerators , organics ( dioxins/furans ) were to be controlled by restricting the allowable emissions to 500 nanograms per normal cubic meter ( ng/Nm 3 ) or 200 grams/billion dscf for total tetra- through octa-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans . To control metals , particulate emission limits were established . They were based on electrostatic precipitators ( ESPs ) . The proposed limits were sixty-nine milligrams per dry standard cubic meter ( mg/dscm ) or 0.030 gr/dscf . BDT for small MSW incinerators included good combustion practices for control of organics and an ESP to control metals and particulate matter . <p> In large MWC plants , organics were to be controlled to 125 ng/Nm 3 ( fifty gr/billion dscf ) ; however , those plants burning refuse-derived fuel ( RDF ) could emit 250 ng/Nm 3 ( one hundred gr/billion dscf ) . Particulate controls were 69 mg/dscm ( 0.030 gr/dscf ) . Acid gas controls , which were not imposed on small MSW incinerators , required a fifty percent emission reduction or twenty-five parts per million by volume ( ppmv ) of HCl and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large plants . BDT for these plants was to include good combustion practices for organics control and dry sorbant injection followed by the use of an ESP or a fabric filter to control metals , particulate matter , and acid gases . Additionally , BDT was to provide further control of organics . <p> Regional MSW incineration plants would have had an organics limit between five and thirty ng/Nm 3 ( two to twelve gr/billion dscf ) , with the precise number to be chosen later by EPA . Particulates were to be controlled to thirty-four mg/dscm ( 0.015 gr/dscf ) . HCl was to be reduced ninety-five percent or to twenty-five ppmv , and SO 2 was required to be reduced eighty-five percent or to thirty ppmv . This was to be achieved first by good combustion practices to control organics , and then by a spray dryer and a fabric filter to control organics , metals and particulates , and acid gas . <p> In addition , all MSW incinerators would have been required to reduce the weight in their MSW inputs by twenty-five percent or more . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , lead-acid vehicle batteries weighing over five kg ( eleven lbs. ) could not be burned , and a program was to be established to remove household batteries prior to combustion . Opacity controls for particulates would also have been required . These waste reduction rules were controversial as they threatened the ability of small incinerators to use BDT. 232 <p> Good combustion practices would have required the following : compliance with carbon monoxide levels in exhaust gas , maximum load limits for each facility , and temperature controls at the particulate control matter device inlet to ensure the gases remain below 230 degrees C ( 450 degrees F ) to minimize dioxin/furan formation . The requisite controls would have varied according to the technology of the MWC . <p> Under the 1989 proposed guidelines , MWC organic emissions were to be tested annually . After three successful years of tests for dioxin/furan , the tests could have been skipped for two years but had to be done at least every three years . Particulate matter testing to ensure control of metals was to be based on a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be determined by using a continuous monitoring system . Testing and data gathering requirements would have been determined later by EPA . At a minimum , each large or regional MSW plant would have required testing every three years for acid gas emissions . Since the passage of the CAA Amendments of 1990 , the issue has been raised as to whether recycling must be evaluated as part of BACT technology . The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that recycling did not have to be considered. 233 But , EPA , in 1992 , ruled that separation of municipal wastes must be evaluated as BACT for preconstruction permits involving waste-to-energy facilities under the CAA. 234 <p> 4 . Impacts of Guidelines <p> Based on the 1989 proposed guidelines , MSW incinerators ' dioxin/furan emissions would have decreased over ninety percent . Metal emissions would have been reduced approximately ninety-seven percent for all metals except mercury . Acid gases , SO 2 and HCl , would have been reduced over fifty percent from a baseline of unregulated emissions . No significant water pollution would have occurred because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have materially affected the solid waste created by incinerators , though the net amount of ash created would increase about three percent due to the use of sorbent material for air pollution control . A small amount of energy would have been required  --  nationally about 73,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year . Waste-to-energy generating plants would have incurred a net reduction in energy production of 2.6 percent . The costs of control on a national average would have been approximately $9.90 per ton of MSW combusted . For large and regional plants , costs would have ranged from $4 to $14 per ton of MSW combusted . D. The 1990 CAA Amendments <p> The pre-1990 CAA requirements imposed on MSW incinerators , discussed above , did not generally represent the degree of protection that could be achieved by a vigorous application of a best available technology standard . Existing incinerators were subject primarily to state regulations which have varied considerably in stringency . In addition , the threshold size for regulation often resulted in having smaller incinerators which served apartments and commercial buildings regulated even less effectively than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSW incinerators were so weak that considerable public distrust developed . This distrust will be difficult to overcome. 235 Hazardous waste facilities , which have been regulated more stringently under RCRA , are also opposed by the public. 236 <p> The CAA Amendments of 1990 created a new CAA section 129 dealing with solid waste combustion. 237 Subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) requires the Administrator to establish performance standards for categories of solid waste incineration units under section s 111 and 129 . The standards should include emission limitations for new units and guidelines under section 111(d) applicable to existing units238 Under this provision and under the new source performance standards of CAA section 111 , EPA is to regulate MSW incinerators with greater than 250 tons per day input by November 15 , 1991 . Standards for MSW incinerators with a capacity equal to or less than 250 tons per day must be adopted by November 15 , 1992. 239 Standards for MSW incinerators combusting commercial or industrial waste , which if combined with MSW can legally be MSW , must be proposed by November 15 , 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also publish a schedule for the promulgation of standards applicable to other categories of solid waste incineration units within eighteen months. 241 <p> Standards applicable to MSW incinerators are to reflect the maximum degree of emission reduction after considering costs , non-air quality health and environmental impacts , and energy requirements . The Administrator may distinguish among classes , types ( including mass burn , refuse-derived fuel , modular , and other types of units ) , and sizes , but emission standards shall not be less stringent than the best controlled similar unit . Existing units may be less stringently controlled than new units , but can not be less stringent than the average of the best performing twelve percent of the units in the regulated category. 242 <p> The statute also requires numerical emission limitations for the following : particulate matter ( PM ) ( total and fine ) , opacity , sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) , hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) , oxides of nitrogen ( NO x ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administrator may also regulate other substances either by emission limitations or by requiring other techniques . The Administrator may promulgate numerical emission limits or may provide for the monitoring of post-combustion concentrations of surrogate substances , parameters or periods of residence time in excess of stated temperatures for the control of other pollutants. 244 <p> For existing units , EPA will promulgate guidelines issued under CAA section 111(d) , and the states will submit to EPA their plans implementing the guidelines within three years after the plans are approved , but not later than five years after the guidelines were promulgated. 245 If the state fails to develop a plan , the Administrator will develop a federal plan. 246 Guidelines for MSW incinerators with capacities greater than 250 tons per day were issued on February 11 , 1991. 247 For MSW incinerators less than or equal to 250 tons per day , guidelines must be promulgated by November 15 , 1992. 248 The guidelines divide plants over 250 tons per day into two categories ; namely , those over 1,100 tons per day and those from 250 tons per day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are termed " very large . " To date , there are forty-five very large MSW incinerators. 249 <p> The Administrator must require appropriate monitoring of emissions and operating parameters . The results of monitoring must be available to the public. 250 By November 15 , 1992 , the Administrator is required to develop a model state program for the training and certification of solid waste incinerator operators . Training is a prerequisite to lawfully operating an incinerator. 251 <p> Beginning thirty-six months after promulgation of performance standards under section s 129(a) and 111 , each unit is required to have a permit issued under both section 129 and subchapter V of the CAA. 252 Permits must be issued for up to twelve years , but they are renewable every five years after public comment and a public hearing. 253 The term " Solid Waste Incineration Unit " is defined to exclude the following : hazardous waste incinerators ; materials recovery facilities that recover metals ; qualifying small power production facilities ; and qualifying cogeneration facilities that burn homogeneous fuel such as tires or waste oil . The term includes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incinerators that burn only wood wastes , yard wastes , or clean lumber are also excluded. 255 New and modified incineration units are subject to the more stringent standards . Modified units are those with modifications that extend the life of the unit and that exceed fifty percent of the original cost of the unit ( not including land ) , or those that make a physical change in the unit or a change in the method of operation which increases the air pollution of any pollutant regulated by section s 129 or 111. 256 Municipal waste is defined in the CAA , 257 and based on this definition an MSW facility must combust more than thirty percent municipal waste by weight of its fuel feed. 258 <p> If the incinerator burns eighty percent or more of its fuel measured on a BTU basis that is solid waste , it shall not be regulated as a utility under CAA subchapter IV. 259 Under the CAA section 129(h) , the states are free to regulate solid waste incinerators more stringently than required by the CAA . <p> While the new CAA section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the overall air pollution control program will also affect such units . MSW incinerators can produce all of the criteria pollutants ( including ozone indirectly through release of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons ) . Changes in the overall ambient air programs may affect incinerator placement . Of particular importance will be the new requirements for nonattainment areas . The 1990 CAA Amendments create a new program for nonattainment areas with more stringent requirements being imposed in these dirty areas. 260 Nonattainment areas are ranked in order of increasing pollution as marginal , moderate , serious , severe , and extreme , with the tightest controls on the most polluted areas . <p> A solid waste incinerator regulated under CAA section s 111 and 129 is not to be regulated under the hazardous air pollutants provision of section 112(d) ( 2 ) . 261 The incineration unit controls approved by section 129 are tied to the hazardous waste provisions of CAA section 112 , including new provisions to protect public health and the environment in section 112(f). 262 But section 112(h) ( 3 ) makes standards under section 129 the standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be regulated to those listed in section 129(a) ( 4 ) . 263 MSW incinerators will be controlled by regulations promulgated under section 111 and 129 , not as hazardous air pollutants ( NESHAPs ) under section 112 . There are also provisions applicable to modifications of facilities that require offsets , 264 with special limitations on the use of offsets for emissions of high risk pollutants such as chlorinated dioxins and furans. 265 In addition , a qualifying resource recovery facility may be able to defer providing offsets and use offsets that become available in the future to cover its requirements. 266 <p> In summary , under the 1990 CAA Amendments a MSW incinerator must meet the following : PREFORMATTED TABLE E. The 1991 CAA Regulations <p> The 1990 CAA Amendments require new regulatory efforts directed at solid waste incinerators , including MSW incinerators. 269 However , EPA was already subject to the consent decree in State of New York v. Reilly270 that required standards to be promulgated for combustion units greater than 250 tons per day . Section 129 has a savings clause authorizing EPA to issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed standards on December 20 , 1989 that have been discussed above. 272 <p> Final standards were due December 31 , 1990 , but the court extended the deadline until January 11 , 1991 . The final rule was published in the Federal Register on February 11 , 1991. 273 Minor changes were made in the proposed rule to conform to the new CAA section 129 requirements , but the Amendments gave EPA one year to revise the standards for large MSW incinerators to conform fully to section 129 . This will require the addition of numerical emission limits for mercury , cadmium , and lead. 274 EPA must also regulate MSW incinerators of 250 tons per day or less capacity within two years. 275 Emission guidelines to be used by states in developing regulations for existing facilities were also promulgated. 276 <p> The new rule will impact new units with the capacity to burn 250 tons or more of trash per day . There are thirty new plants with a total of seventy combustion units expected to be constructed by 1995 that will be subject to its provisions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred existing MSW incinerators , each having two or three combustion units over 250 tons per day. 277 This was the first rule promulgated under the new CAA . <p> The final rule for new , modified or reconstructed MSW incinerators was based on CAA section 111(b) . The emission guidelines for the states were based on CAA section 111(d) . However , in the 1990 Amendments , CAA section 112 now requires technology-based standards for hazardous air pollutants , 278 and CAA section 129 directs EPA to issue technology-based standards for MSW incinerators under both section s 129 and 111. 279 Thus , this final regulation is based on more than one section of the CAA and establishes the best technological system of continuous emission reduction as defined in CAA section 111(a) ( 1 ) . This standard is called Best Demonstrated Technology ( BDT ) . 280 <p> The final regulation applies to any facility that combusts 250 tons per day or more of MSW by burning or pyrolysis with or without heat recovery. 281 BDT is specified as : <p> ( 1 ) Good combustion practices ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 2 ) a spray dryer ( SD ) followed by a fabric filter ( FF ) to achieve additional control of MWC organics as well as MWC metals , and MWC acid gases. 282 The best technological basis for reducing NO x emissions from affected new MWCs is an emission limit based on application of selective noncatalytic reduction ( SNCR ) at a typical MWC. 283 The NO x emission level can be met by combustor design , the application of post-combustion control ( such as SNCR ) or a combination of the two. 284 <p> The proposed standard included the separation of recoverable materials prior to combustion as part of best demonstrated technology for reducing emissions . Under the final standards , materials separation is not included as part of best demonstrated technology . The rationale for this change is described in section VIII.B of this notice. 285 <p> Good combustion practices also include mandatory operating parameters for carbon monoxide , combustor load level , and flue gas temperature limits. 286 The first two parameters are specified for each of the combustor technologies , but the temperature limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final standards require certification of the chief facility operator and the shift supervisor , but since CAA section 129 requires EPA to develop an MWC operator training and certification program within two years , these requirements will have to be updated at that time. 287 The final MWC organic standard is a dioxin/furan emission limit of thirty nanograms per dry standard cubic meter ( dscm ) at seven percent oxygen ( O 2 ) . 288 This is the high end of the proposed standard. 289 To control metals , there is a particulate emission limit of thirty-four milligrams per dry standard cubic meter ( dscm ) at seven percent oxygen ( O 2 ) and an opacity limit of ten percent based on a six minute average. 290 Mercury , lead and cadmium emission limits were not established , but were required by regulation under CAA section 129(a) ( 4 ) . 291 Proposals to require the separation of household batteries and lead-acid batteries were deleted from the final standards. 292 The reason for the deletion is that the battery industry has reduced the mercury content of alkaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductions are expected to occur. 293 Mercury oxide button cell batteries are thirty-five percent mercury , but there is no known way to remove them from MSW effectively . They will , nevertheless , be indirectly controlled by the emission limits required for mercury by November 15 , 1991 under CAA section 1297 Lead-acid battery removal was considered to be occurring already because of requirements imposed by section 3001(i) of RCRA , and further regulation was considered unnecessary. 295 The more general requirement for recycling through a mandatory twenty-five percent source separation requirement found in the proposed incinerator rule was dropped because of pressure exerted on EPA by then Vice President Quayle 's Council on Competitiveness. 296 Environmentalists reacted with outrage , and the battle will probably continue during the RCRA reauthorization process. 297 The Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) and the states of New York and Florida brought a law suit against EPA in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit . They sought to reverse the lead-acid battery determination and to force EPA to reverse its decision to drop the twenty-five percent separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own findings was not a reasoned decision , as is required by the CAA and the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) . 298 The exemption of lead-acid batteries from the regulation resulted in a remand on July 14 , 1992 , when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that EPA did not adequately explain why a ban on lead-acid batteries was not the best demonstrated technology. 299 Thus , the controversy continues . EPA won , however , on its decision to omit recycling provisions from the MSW incinerator rule . 300 <p> Acid gas limits are established for sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) . 301 There must be an eighty percent reduction in SO 2 and a ninety-five percent reduction in HCl. 302 There is also a nitrogen oxide standard of 180 ppmv. 303 <p> Monitoring of incinerator operation has been strengthened . Continuous monitoring is required for CO level , MWC load level and flue gas temperature. 304 Dioxin/furans must be tested in compliance with Method 23 which was also promulgated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified to determine compliance with PM limits and must be performed annually. 306 Continuous monitoring of SO 2 and NO x is required. 307 HCl is to be monitored by Method 26 as promulgated in the February 11 , 1991 Federal Register. 308 Reporting and record keeping requirements are mandated , and the records must be made available to the public. 309 EPA projects these standards to reduce dioxin/furan emissions by ninety-nine percent compared to uncontrolled emissions . For all metals except mercury , reductions of ninety-nine percent are projected . Acid gases will be approximately ninety-four percent controlled . NO x will be reduced about forty-five percent . There is no significant water pollution from MSW incineration , and solid waste is reduced approximately ninety percent by incineration. 310 The cost of the required controls will be nearly $11 per ton of MSW combusted . Typical costs of collecting , transporting , and combusting MSW , combined with disposing of the ash , now range from $36 to over $90 per ton . Assuming the full cost of the controls are passed on to MWC customers , increase in disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 311 <p> These new regulations demonstrate that environmentalists have been correct in their claims that state of the art incinerators could produce emissions far below what has commonly been required by state and federal law. 312 There are two levels of guidelines applicable to existing MSW incinerators of greater than 250 tons per day capacity . The most stringent limits apply to very large plants over 1,100 tons per day ; less stringent standards apply to large plants  --  those above 250 tons per day but less than 1,100 tons per day. 313 For very large plants , dioxin/furan limits are sixty ng/dscm ( twice as lenient as the new source standard ) and a limit of 125 ng/dscm for large plants. 314 <p> Other requirements are similar to those imposed on new sources but are not as stringent . PM limits are thirty-four and sixty-nine mg/dscm for very large and large plants , respectively . SO 2 reductions must be seventy percent for very large plants and fifty percent for large plants ; HCl reductions must be ninety percent for very large plants and fifty percent for large plants. 315 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complied with , even though they only apply to the largest MSW incinerators . This is because this portion of the combustor universe deals with most of the wastes that are incinerated . The air pollutants that these regulations require removed still must go somewhere . The problem is that " somewhere " is increasingly difficult to find . <p> In May , 1990 , the final rule on land disposal of over 450 RCRA regulated wastes was issued. 316 The RCRA regulations make land disposal of air pollutants captured by control equipment both difficult and costly. 317 While EPA 's announced policy of September 18 , 1992 is to treat MSW incinerator ash as non-hazardous , that position can be changed by Congress , the judiciary , or the EPA. 318 <p> Nonetheless , the key questions are whether these new regulations protect public health and whether facilities can be operated over an extended time period while still meeting the requirements . Moreover , if NIMBY issues are to be overcome , facilities not only must be operated to protect public health , but the public must believe they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that while environmentalists are greatly concerned with mercury emissions from incinerators , electric utilities are one of the major sources of mercury released to the air . Yet , electric utilities are not even required to report their toxic emissions under the Emergency Planning &; Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986. 319 About thirty percent of the coal burned by electric utilities has a high mercury content , especially northern Appalachian bituminous coal , North Dakota lignite , and Texas lignite. 320 Thus , we must keep in mind that even harmful emissions from MSW incinerators need to be evaluated in terms of their relative health effects on the population . F. Health Risks Associated with MSW Incineration <p> Incinerators that burn organics will not burn everything . The products of incomplete combustion ( PICs ) are among the most toxic pollutants found in stack gases of MSW incinerators . The major risks associated with MSW incinerators are from chlorinated dioxins ( which are partially carried by PICs ) , cadmium , arsenic , and chromium . <p> The level of acceptable risk is not a subject on which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which include synergistic or antagonistic reaction among different compounds , and indirect pathways such as ingestion of food from crops exposed to air pollutants , have not been thoroughly studied . The risks of dioxin exposure are greater in magnitude than the risks for the heavy metals . It is estimated that dioxin has a maximum risk of producing one cancer case in every 1000 individuals exposed to MSW incinerator emissions for a lifetime. 321 Modern facilities using scrubbers can reduce this risk by an order of magnitude . EPA 's Science Advisory Board considers these risk estimates to be too high , but considerable controversy surrounds this subject. 322 Making estimates is problematic in that data concerning lethality and decreased longevity following inhalation exposure of humans or animals to 2,3,7,8-TCDD is unavailable in the literature. 323 <p> In June , 1987 , EPA issued a nine volume report to Congress that detailed the information that was available on municipal waste combustors ( MWCs ) . 324 Included in the report was a study of the health risks from using MSW incinerators. 325 On July 7 , 1987 , EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate new and existing MSW incinerators under section s 111(b) and 111(d) of the CAA , respectively. 326 The Administrator determined that MSW incineration may reasonably be expected to contribute to the endangerment of public health and welfare . However , because of the uncertainties of estimating cancer risks , the Administrator did not list the emissions from MSW incinerators as hazardous air pollutants under the CAA section 112. 327 <p> The estimated health effects in the 1987 ANPRM were based on evaluations of health effects data for individual chemical constituents of MWC emissions . The information was combined with estimates of population exposure to determine the risks presented by MSW incinerator emissions. 328 There were no epidemiologic studies . Also , there were no direct human or animal studies of MSW incinerator impacts . EPA evaluated the impact of the criteria pollutants  --  particulate matter ( PM ) , sulfur oxides ( SO x ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , and nitrogen oxides ( NO x ) . These pollutants are produced in the amount of approximately 10,000 tons per year . The other hazardous pollutants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen chloride . The criteria pollutants health effects are described in the relevant criteria documents. 329 Also reviewed were the health effects associated with inhalation exposure to lead and mercury emissions . The modeling results predicted no long term concentrations above the ambient lead standard of 1.5 ug/m 3 ( quarterly average ) or the mercury NESHAP ambient guidelines of one ug/m 3 . 330 <p> EPA also reviewed the cancer risks associated with exposing the population continuously from birth throughout their lifetime to MSW incinerator emissions . EPA recognized that of all the PICs emitted , chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans would be the pollutants that resulted in most of the health risk from MSW incineration . For existing MSW incinerators , EPA projected two to forty excess cancer cases per year for the most exposed populations ; the maximum risk was projected to range from 10 -6 to 10 -3 for the lifetime individual cancer risk . An estimate with a range of three orders of magnitude , however , does not provide much useful information . The risk of cancer in the most exposed populations from projected new MSW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk ranges from 10 -6 to 10 -4 . 331 Both existing and projected facilities were assumed to have organics controlled by twenty percent . Particulates were assumed to be controlled to the levels required in 1987 , and ninety-nine percent controls were assumed for projected facilities as required by the existing requirements for new construction. 332 The pollutants and their associated projected maximum individual risk ranges were : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In 1989 , EPA reviewed the cancer risk information in the 1987 <p> ANPRM and concluded " that cancer risks for MWC 's are likely at the lower end of the earlier estimated ranges cited in the ANPRM , although there remain significant uncertainties in the risk assessment . " 333 Based on this data , most of the risk from MSW incinerators is the risk of exposure to chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans ( CDD/CDF ) . The rest of the pollutants have such low risk that they do not materially affect the overall risk . The question then is whether CDD/CDF emissions can be effectively and reliably controlled to produce de minimis risk . <p> In 1989 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of an epidemiological study of data on 192 chemical workers exposed to dioxin over the past forty years at twelve plants . The study found no increased cancer risk among 3,500 workers with average dioxin levels ninety times greater than normal . The study found only a slight excess cancer risk among those exposed to the highest levels  --  those registering 500 times what is normal. 334 The study concluded that occupational exposure to TCDD does not confirm the high relative risks reported for many cancers in previous studies. 335 It seemed possible that this study might lead to a relaxation in dioxin regulation by EPA. 336 <p> In October , 1990 , thirty-eight of the world 's leading authorities on dioxin met in Long Island , New York at the " Banbury Conference " to examine the scientific data concerning human risks from dioxin. 337 They concluded that the linear model used in the United States is not accurate . A linear model assumes any exposure creates a risk . Instead , they endorsed a receptor-based model that allows for the presence of dioxin in the environment , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents an evolution of expert thinking to a conclusion that dioxin effects are receptor-mediated , and therefore several thousand receptors must be occupied before a toxic effect can be observed. 338 On April 8 , 1991 , the EPA Administrator ordered a complete reevaluation of the risks associated with dioxin exposure and EPA 's related regulations. 339 In late 1992 , EPA was reassessing dioxin science in the Agency 's Office of Research and Development. 340 G. EPA 's Reassessment of the Dioxin Risk <p> It is apparent that one of the key issues surrounding the evaluation of the incineration option concerns the assessment of the dioxin risk . Because of the historical uncertainty surrounding the dioxin risk , any decision on the role of MSW incineration must , therefore , include a detailed evaluation of the effects of dioxin on human health and the environment . <p> Historically , the information concerning dioxin effects has been sparse and inconclusive . In EPA 's " Health Assessment Document for Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins , " 341 the majority of the epidemiology studies pertained to groups of herbicide applicators with potential exposure to phenoxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research available at the time provided limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of these compounds in humans , and that " with respect to the dioxin impurities contained therein , the evidence for human carcinogenicity for 2,3,7,8-TCDD based on the epidemiologic studies is only suggestive " 342 In its next report , the review draft of " A Cancer Risk-Specific Dose Estimate for 2,3,7,8-TCDD , " 343 the focus was essentially the same and EPA concluded that " the human evidence supporting an association between exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and cancer is considered inadequate . " 344 <p> In April , 1991 , EPA Administrator William Reilly announced that EPA would conduct a scientific reassessment of the risks of exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD as well as chemically similar compounds , all collectively referred to as dioxin. 345 EPA undertook this task in response to emerging scientific knowledge of the biological , human health , and environmental effects of dioxin where significant advances have been made in the scientific understanding of the following : the mechanisms of dioxin toxicity ; the carcinogenic and other adverse health effects of dioxin in humans ; the pathways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment. 346 EPA made the reassessment of dioxin a public effort , convening two public hearings ( November 15 , 1991 and April 28 , 1992 ) to inform the public and to receive the public 's comments and reviews of the proposed plans for the reassessment and to receive scientifically relevant information . <p> The reassessment of dioxin has consisted of five major categories of activities : ( 1 ) development of a biologically based dose-response model for dioxin ; ( 2 ) update and revision of the health assessment document for dioxin ; ( 3 ) laboratory research in support of the dose-response model ; ( 4 ) update and revision of the dioxin exposure assessment document ; and ( 5 ) research to characterize ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems . Activities ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) have been undertaken and are the basis of the draft EPA documents discussed below . The fifth activity is in progress , but the results will not be available for review until 1994. 347 <p> On August 18 , 1992 , EPA published a notice in the Federal Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These activities related to EPA 's release of draft349 documents on exposure assessment procedures350 and health assessment issues related to EPA 's reassessment of dioxin. 351 The draft documents released by EPA contain extensive technical information . A complete review and analysis of this information is beyond the scope of this article . However , an understanding of the basic protocols EPA followed and the limitations of the research is useful . Therefore , the Appendix of this article provides relevant excerpts from EPA 's draft assessment material . H. Welfare Effects <p> In addition to health risks , welfare risks are created by acid gases , particularly hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) , that are emitted in significant quantities . At or above ambient annual average levels of 3 ug/m 3 , HCl corrodes ferrous metals . The majority of existing MSW incinerators exceed this level . EPA 's data was unclear on whether new or more stringently regulated units would produce an HCl problem . The problem with evaluating incinerators is partly that their technology has been the result of weak regulatory requirements . Particulate matter emitted from new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 at 0.08 grains per dscf . Since 1986 it has been regulated by the more stringent large industrial boiler standard of 0.1 pounds per million BTU for incinerators of over approximately 200 tons per day. 352 <p> Although dioxin and other incinerator emissions have been studied since 1984 , little effective federal regulation had occurred before the 1991 regulations. 353 Because incinerator requirements were largely limited to state requirements , existing facilities present potential risks that do not represent present technology . If electric power producers were judged on the basis of their emissions in the 1950s , we would probably desire to refrain from electricity generation . The new regulation requires a ninety-five percent reduction in HCl emissions or a twenty-five ppmv emission limit. 354 <p> HCl is not required to be continuously monitored . It is only required to be measured once a year with a stack gas test. 355 Performance tests must be conducted in accordance with Method 26 which was also promulgated in the Federal Register on February 11 , 1991. 356 Most acid gas discussion in the material included as part of the regulatory process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that the ninety-five percent HCl control is achievable. 357 IV . ANALYSIS <p> Land disposal represents a waste of resources unless the cost of this option , including environmental costs , makes it an appropriate choice . Recycling allows waste to be used as a resource . Incineration at least allows wastes to be used for their energy value . The Bush Administration proposed a seven-fold increase in MSW incineration as part of the National Energy Strategy ( NES ) . The NES noted that our 160 waste-to-energy plants produce useable energy that is equivalent to burning 150,000 barrels of oil each day. 358 Incineration should not be stopped because of unrealistic worst-case scenarios . Nor should it be encouraged if an option higher in the hierarchy of MSW management options is economically available . <p> Significant advances have occurred in recent years in the technology of air pollution controls applicable to MSW incinerators. 359 If state-of-the-art dry scrubbing systems followed by fabric filters are used , particulate emissions should be minimal . Acid gas scrubbers to control HCl and SO 2 will also remove organic and heavy metal pollutants. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particulate control device limits downstream CDD/CDF formation. 361 This does not mean that incinerators are safe ; rather the risk may be at or below the risks associated with other MSW management options . Even recycling is not risk-free . Incineration should then be compared to other alternatives , such as recycling , as has been done by the Environmental Defense Fund for New York City , 362 rather than using appeals to the public 's fear of chemicals as the basis for decision-making . <p> MSW incineration is a rational option for managing solid waste . Its major weakness is the potential health problems from emissions , with emissions of dioxins/furans ( CDD/CDF ) being the most significant potential health risk . A second weakness is the yet unproven ability of our regulators to effectively control emissions over the life of the facility . <p> A definitive position on dioxins ' risk will not be released by EPA for several years . Clearly more information is needed that examines dioxin exposure scenarios at levels relevant to the MSW incineration technology . EPA expects to begin drawing up a generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and several years after that , new scientific information will be used to create new regulations. 363 The Agency for Toxic Substances &; Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) , with EPA assistance , is also beginning a three-year study of the health effects of a municipal waste incinerator in North Carolina. 364 Because dioxin effects are so controversial , studies may go on indefinitely . <p> But the presently available risk estimates discussed above , if accurate , show an acceptable risk . Even so , it is understandable that citizens might oppose incinerators  --  especially existing facilities . The risk is acceptable , only because it is no greater than risks of life commonly accepted by the public . The 1991 incineration regulations adopted a thirty nanogram per dscm limit at seven percent oxygen ( O 2 ) ( twelve grains per billion dscf ) for dioxin/furan emissions . This was the high end of the five to thirty ng/dscm limit proposed for MSW incinerators above 250 tons per day capacity. 365 What is the public health risk of this emission limit ? EPA does not specifically address this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states for existing facilities impose a much more lenient sixty and 125 ng/dscm standard on very large and large MWC plants , respectively. 366 It is significant that EPA 's emission limits for total dioxins/furans are not derived using health risk data , but are based on emission levels achievable by specific types of control technologies. 367 <p> There are seventy-five possible dioxins ( also known as dibenzo-p-dioxins ) and 135 chlorodibenzofuran compounds . The most common is a colorless , odorless solid known as 2,3,7,8-TCDD . This substance does not occur naturally nor is it manufactured except for small quantities used as reference standards . It is produced during incineration of hazardous and municipal waste , but it is also a contaminant in some herbicides and in the germicide hexachlorophene . It is also produced by pulp and paper manufacturing plants and from some chlorinated wastes. 368 <p> The only disease known to be caused by dioxin is chloracne , a severe skin lesion that is disfiguring . There is evidence that suggests it may cause liver damage and perhaps digestive disorders . It has been demonstrated to be toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been demonstrated in humans . In some animal species , especially monkeys , it has adverse reproductive effects and teratogenic effects . It is considered a probable carcinogen in humans. 369 There is no generally effective medical test to determine exposure to dioxin nor is there enough information to know the exposure risk from inhalation . The limited information on dioxin risks derive primarily from ingestion studies . EPA estimates the risk at 1,560 additional cases of cancer per 10,000 people exposed for a lifetime to one nanogram of 2,3,7,8-TCDD per kilogram of bodyweight each day . But based on the paucity of data , this is a mere guess of the upper limit of risk. 370 <p> There have been no reports of deaths in humans as a result of oral exposure to dioxin. 371 There are no studies on the inhalation toxicity of dioxin . Veterans of the Vietnam conflict have worked for years to prove that dioxin contaminated herbicide was responsible for health problems they were experiencing , but they have had great difficulty in trying to show harm. 372 Herbicide spraying would presumably result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if the 1991 MWC regulations are enforced . Again , the dioxin issue needs further research examining responses to dioxin levels relevant to the MSW incineration option . Indeed , some researchers have suggested that dioxin exposure can be greater from drinking milk than from direct exposure to inhalation sources. 373 <p> EPA has produced data showing a risk from incinerators that should be of concern . The public and certain environmental groups use such estimates in their efforts to oppose incineration . That a suspected but unproven carcinogen in quantities emitted from the oldest , highest polluting incinerators is the basis for the highest risk estimates is an unpublicized fact . Moreover , nonheat recovery mass burn facilities have the highest cancer risk for existing MSW incineration ; 374 however , these are not the types of facilities being proposed . The baseline assumption assumed the use of only ESPs to control particulate matter375 despite the fact that the new guidelines for large existing plants require good combustion practices376 and a spray dryer followed by an ESP. 377 New sources have even more stringent requirements . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxin and related compounds to harm humans , the public is unlikely to embrace exposure to these substances . Nevertheless , we can not live in a risk free society . A 10 -6 risk , which seems easily achievable for MSW incinerator operation , would result in approximately 230 additional cases of cancer per year assuming the worst-case scenario that everyone in the United States lived a lifetime directly downwind from an MSW incinerator . Assuming they all died of cancer , this would be an increase of cancer mortality of about 0.05 percent over the 496,200 deaths due to cancer in 1989. 878 It should be noted that smoking is now considered to be responsible for up to 434,000 deaths in the United States each year. 379 The actual risks from MSW incinerators will be less than the worst-case scenario because few people actually spend their entire lives ( or even a significant portion of their lives ) downwind from such facilities . Many people will instead be experiencing the combined risks of living near hazardous waste incinerators , land disposal sites , industrial air polluters , low or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . Even if we move away from air pollution sources , we may still face risks from nearby prisons , half-way houses and a host of other necessary public and private facilities that each present a small risk . No risk associated with waste disposal through incineration of MSW amounts to even one percent of the risk of being a murder victim. 380 <p> Through proper incineration practices we can probably reduce the cancer risk from MSW incinerators to even lower than 10 -6 . 381 The goals of good combustion practices ( GCP ) include : maximizing the destruction of organics in the incinerator ; minimizing the release of particulate matter from the furnace ; and minimizing the creation of dioxin/furan compounds downstream due to reactions in the flue gases. 382 Apparently , the new regulatory program , if enforced , would be more than adequate to protect the public health . <p> Monitoring and supervising incinerator operations so as to assure continued proper operation is another challenge . To encourage public confidence in MSW incineration , the monitoring provisions of the 1991 regulations should be implemented and publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the risks of incineration . It should be emphasized that much of the existing health data is based on emissions that greatly exceed what is allowed under the 1990 CAA . The monitoring provisions are also greatly strengthened. 383 Still , more could be done to encourage public acceptance . <p> To make MSW incineration more acceptable , the following elements should be incorporated into a permit : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> If incineration is ever to be accepted by the public , the monitoring and enforcement process needs to be improved substantially . At the Baird-McGuire site in Massachusetts , EPA Region 1 officials are considering installing a monitor with a twenty-four-hour readout at the city hall . This would increase community oversight of the incinerator 's operation. 385 If this is what is required to create public confidence in the environmental protection effort , it should be done . V. CONCLUSION <p> Environmentalists oppose MSW incinerators for several reasons . Some believe there are serious health hazards associated with MSW incinerators386 despite the data that projects a risk far below that posed by death inflicted by other factors such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not believe they will be appropriately regulated . Others oppose incineration because they believe it will hamper recycling efforts. 389 A coalition of twelve environmental organizations , including the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , and the Sierra Club , have called for a complete moratorium on the construction of new MSW incinerators until the year 2000 to encourage waste reduction and recycling. 390 Moreover , some organizations believe that a gridlock on solutions to solid waste issues will compel a change in life-styles in the direction of greater harmony with our ecosystem. 391 Industry , however , sees the high cost of incineration as a significant incentive for waste minimization . Forcing people to pay the true cost of disposal through proper incineration gets rid of existing waste and encourages waste reduction efforts. 392 It is critical to ensure that the cost of each manufactured object includes the cost of environmentally protective disposal. 393 In such circumstances , manufacturers would have an incentive to devise more environmentally appropriate products , and consumers would have a voice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to incineration is irrational or motivated by considerations having little to do with environmental or public health protection . The intensity of opposition is fueled by environmental groups who , rather than finding overriding faults with MSW incineration , oppose the siting of incinerators in order to bring about dramatic changes in the way society consumes materials and products . Some of the NIMBY opposition to incineration is an attempt to shift equal or greater risks to another jurisdiction by requiring a non-incineration option that will be located in a different jurisdiction . We need to confront the NIMBY problem which vastly impacts waste-disposal costs . These opponents will never be satisfied , but perhaps a majority of the public can be convinced to evaluate the MSW management options consistently. 395 While the aim  --  forcing a rethinking of consumer choices  --  is laudable , the call for a ban on the siting of MSW incinerators is not . There are other ways to ensure that the costs of products include their costs of disposal and concomitantly to ensure that MSW management practices are safe for humans and the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been described as " an environmental moralism that skirts the practical problems of how to sort household trash and find markets for recycled materials . " 396 While recycling holds much promise in easing pressures on landfills and conserving valuable resources , it alone can not solve the MSW problem . In addition to source reduction , MSW incineration needs to be part of the solution . Incineration reduces the " garbage mountain " and can provide a useful byproduct , i.e. , electricity. 397 Communities must begin to recognize that incineration can be an environmentally benign and efficient way to deal with the MSW problem. 398 Thus , the options should not be considered wholly independent . Rather , they should be seen as complementary so that MSW management in the United States is environmentally and economically optimal . <p> Nevertheless , incineration creates a level of opposition that is not typically found in the process of selecting other options such as landfills . For example , a hazardous waste incinerator in East Liverpool , Ohio has been the subject of community opposition for twelve years . Citizens have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been arrested at the site , at the Ohio EPA headquarters , and at the EPA 's offices in Washington , D.C. In the Autumn of 1992 , more than a hundred demonstrators were arrested at the site protesting a planned shakedown burn. 399 Whether dispassionate analysis of the solid waste management options can overcome this level of citizen passion is unknown . In any event , environmental professionals have a duty to continue their efforts to understand the actual risks of each solid waste management option and to develop and implement the processes and technology necessary to minimize the risks . The key is to ensure that we utilize an integrated program of source reduction , recycling , incineration , and landfills using state-of-the-art technology . We will not solve the MSW problem unless all options are pursued together . Therefore , at this time , MSW incineration appears to be a viable waste management option with the advantage of permanently disposing of much of the waste . Its use helps to solve the pernicious problem of appropriate MSW management and disposal . It may not be the perfect solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant excerpts from two EPA draft documents concerning the environmental and health effects surrounding the dioxin issue. 400 <p> I. ESTIMATING EXPOSURE TO DIOXIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS . <p> The primary purpose of this document is to present procedures for conducting site-specific exposure assessments to dioxin-like compounds . Information is provided on the levels of these compounds found in various media , identification of the possible sources , and estimates of the resulting exposure levels . The types of sites covered in this document include MSW incinerators , landfills , and other areas involving contaminated soils . The procedures outlined in the document identify possible exposure pathways associated with these sites , present fate models to estimate media concentrations at the point(s) of exposure , and identify ways to estimate contact rates and resultant exposure levels. 401 <p> This document provides methodologies and background information for conducting site-specific exposure assessments to dioxin-like compounds . While most of the details of this document are beyond the scope of this article , it is worthwhile to briefly summarize the chapters directly pertinent to this discussion . Specifically , Chapters 3 , 6 , 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental Levels of PCDD , PCDF , and PCB Congeners . <p> This chapter summarizes the levels of dioxin-like compounds found in various media . Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are found in all media ( air , soil , and water ) , and are ubiquitous in fish and shellfish , meat , milk , and vegetation. 403 Although the manufacture of most chlorinated phenolic products , including PCBs , ceased in the late 1970s , the continued use and disposal of these compounds results in the release of PCDDs , PCDFs , and PCBs to the environment. 404 Other sources of dioxin compounds include releases from the combustion of municipal and chemical wastes , chlorination of municipal water , release of household bleaches into sewer systems , and chlorine bleaching processes in paper mills. 405 Because of these processes , PCDDs , PCDFs , and PCBs become available for human exposure via various pathways. 406 <p> The chapter provides the ranges of these compounds found in air , 407 soil , 408 water , 409 sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited studies . These data provide a general indication of these compound levels in the various media throughout the world. 413 Chapter 6 . Municipal Solid Waste Incineration . <p> This chapter provides procedures to estimate the emission rates of dioxin-like compounds from MSW incinerators , including stack and fly ash emissions . The combustion of MSW releases potentially harmful pollutants to the air from incinerator stacks . Of particular concern is the potential human health and environmental effects of the emissions during the period of incinerator operation . Various theories have been proposed to explain the presence of dioxins ( such as PCDDs and PCDFs ) in MSW incinerator emissions. 414 These theories include the following : ( 1 ) the compounds are present as contaminants in bleached paper or other MSW constituents , and some portion of them survives the incineration process ; ( 2 ) the compounds result from de novo synthesis from precursors , such as PCBs , chlorophenols , and chlorinated benzenes ; and ( 3 ) the compounds are synthesized from materials unrelated to PCDDs or PCDFs , such as petroleum products , polynuclear aromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastics. 415 Researchers have postulated that PCDDs and PCDFs are created on the reactive surface of fly ash ( i.e. , particulate matter ) downstream of the furnace zone where the temperature of combustion offgases have cooled between 200 degrees and 400 degrees C.416 Based on experiments , these researchers believe that inorganic chloride ions , such as copper chloride , present in the combustion gas may act as a catalyst to promote surface reactions on particulate matter which converts aromatic compounds to chlorinated dioxins and dibenzonfurans. 417 Further , it appears that the formation of PCDDs and PCDFs on the surfaces of fly ash during MSW incineration occurs in a temperature window. 418 <p> One series of experiments discounts the likelihood of the first theory of dioxin emissions , namely that dioxin in the MSW accounts for dioxin emissions at the stack. 419 The air emission of PCBs from MSW incinerators is less understood , but based on various tests , it appears that PCB contamination in the raw MSW that is fed into the incinerator may account for the emission of PCBs. 420 <p> For purposes of exposure analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , location and set of environmental conditions. 421 EPA then estimated the mass rate of emission of specific congeners of PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs from the stack of the hypothetical MSW incinerator. 422 The mass of ash that is produced as a residue from the combustion of MSW on the grate within the incinerator ( bottom ash ) , and the ash that was collected by the particulate matter control device ( fly ash ) , were also estimated . This estimation was useful for the analysis of human exposures to dioxin-like compounds after storing , transporting , and disposing of the ash residues from the incinerator into a landfill. 423 In addition , EPA estimated deposition of the dioxin-like compounds emitted from the stack of the hypothetical MSW incinerator. 424 <p> Ambient air and surface deposition modeling of emissions for the hypothetical incinerator were estimated for two pollution control scenarios : ( 1 ) ESP ; and ( 2 ) dry scrubber combined with fabric filter ( DSFF ) . 425 The air dispersion modeling for both scenarios indicated that maximum ambient air and surface deposition concentration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding to a westerly wind direction ) . 428 Further , most of the ground-level impact associated with stack emissions will occur within five kilometers from the incinerator for both control scenarios. 427 Chapter 7 . Exposure Scenario Development . <p> Chapter 7 provides procedures for identifying exposure pathways , and estimating contact rates and resulting exposure levels . Approaches for exposure scenario evaluation428 as applied to dioxin-like compounds are presented . As discussed above , dioxin-like compounds have been found primarily in air , soil , sediment and biota ( and in water to a lesser degree ) . 429 As noted above , the typical exposure430 pathways were considered . Specifically , EPA estimated exposure values431 for soil ingestion , 432 soil dermal contact , 433 vapor and dust inhalation , 434 water ingestion , 435 beef and dairy product ingestion , 436 fish ingestion , 437 and ingestion of fruits and vegetables. 438 Chapter 9 . Demonstration of Methodology . <p> Chapter 9 integrates the information concerning site-specific methodologies and develops hypothetical exposure scenarios. 439 Exposure scenarios were developed which are associated with four source categories : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil ; 441 ( 3 ) incinerator stack emissions ; 442 and ( 4 ) incinerator ash disposal in a landfill. 443 Three dioxin-like compounds were demonstrated for each of the exposure scenarios. 444 <p> The results of this assessment of exposure scenarios included exposure media concentrations for all exposure pathways , and exposure estimates which are Lifetime Average Daily Doses ( LADDs ) for all pathways and example compounds. 445 EPA cautions , however , that " these observations are not generalizable comments . Different results would arise from different source strength characteristics , proximity considerations , model parameter values , different models altogether , and so on . " 446 <p> Briefly , the modeled results exhibited the following trends . Concentrations of the example contaminants in soil for soil ingestion and dermal contact pathways varied under the scenarios and with distance from the hypothetical incinerator , but were in the ug/kg ( =ppt ) range. 447 " Concentrations of contaminants in the vapor phase ranged from 10 - 11 to 10 -8 ug/m 3 . " 448 Particulate-phase air-borne contaminant concentrations " were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 449 " Concentrations of the example contaminants in drinking water were 10 - 14 to 10 -9 mg/L ( =ppm ) . 450 " Concentrations in fish ranged from 10 -9 to 10 -4 mg/kg. " 451 Concentrations in fruit and vegetables " ranged from 10 - 11 to 10 -7 mg/kg ( =ppm ) . " 452 Concentrations in beef and milk were comparable to fish and ranged from 10sup-9 to 10sup-3 mg/kg. 453 <p> Finally , there were reportable trends for the analyses of Lifetime Average Daily Dose estimates . Overall , the LADD estimates ranged from 10 - 17 mg/kg-day to 10 -8 mg/kg-day. 454 The highest exposure estimates were associated with the ash landfill and the off-site soil contamination scenarios , which had the highest exposure media concentrations for all exposure media. 455 Exposures associated with stack emissions and on-site soil contamination with low soil concentration were similar , with a range of 10 - 17 to 10 - 10 mg/kg-day. 456 Again , EPA noted these estimates can not be safely used outside the parameters of these modeling exercises because of the complex interplay of fate and transport modeling , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about exposure behavior. 457 The uncertainty in these estimates is described fully in Chapter 10 and is also summarized below . Chapter 11 . Conclusions and Recommendations . <p> Finally , Chapter 11 presents the conclusions concerning how humans are exposed to dioxin-like compounds and offers recommendations for future research to help resolve the uncertainties that have plagued dioxin assessments. 458 These are briefly summarized below . <p> The primary findings and conclusions of the assessment indicate that dioxin-like compounds are commonly found in soils , sediments and biota throughout the world. 459 Concentrations in non-industrial rural areas are typically lower than in urban or industrial areas. 460 Overall , the assessment suggests a background exposure level in the range of 20-90 pg of TEq/day for total dioxin-like compounds using data for world-wide sources. 461 <p> In addition , the draft document provides estimations of individual exposures to four categories of contamination sources : 462 ( 1 ) on-site soils  --  i.e. , the soil contamination and exposure occur at the same site ; 463 ( 2 ) off-site soils  --  i.e. , the contaminated soil is spatially separated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions  --  i.e. , individuals near incinerators are directly exposed via inhalation of impacted air and indirectly exposed as a result of the deposition of contaminated emissions onto soils and vegetation ; 465 and ( 4 ) ash landfill  --  i.e. , similar to the off-site soil category except that the source of exposure is incinerator ash. 466 The report indicates that exposures estimated for individuals living near areas of relatively high soil concentrations ( i.e. , the off-site soil and ash landfill categories ) were two to three orders of magnitude higher as compared to the on-site and stack emission exposure estimates. 467 The highly generalized conclusions indicate that the highest human exposures estimated were associated with farm ( beef and dairy ) products. 468 The prevalence of food chain exposures is explained by the tendency of dioxin-like compounds to bioaccumulate in food products of high fat content and the related ingestion rates of these food products. 469 Other exposures occur through dermal contact with soil and soil ingestion . To a lesser degree , exposures occur through inhalation , fruit and vegetable ingestion , and water ingestion. 470 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical areas : ( 1 ) the lack of congener-specific data is cited as a major source of uncertainty ; ( 2 ) the use of pharmacokinetics in estimating exposure levels ; ( 3 ) estimating fish tissue concentrations ; ( 4 ) the components of the model to estimate dairy ( beef and milk ) concentrations ; ( 5 ) the evaluation of additional exposure pathways ( e.g. , ingestion of other farm products such as chickens , eggs , and pork ) ; ( 6 ) comprehensive inventory of key sources of dioxin-like compound contamination ; and ( 7 ) reduction in uncertainty in several model parameters to increase the reliability of estimates. 471 It is clear that , although our understanding of the dioxin issue is expanding , there continues to be a critical lack of certainty on many fronts . <p> II . HEALTH ASSESSMENT FOR TCDD AND RELATED COMPOUNDS . <p> The other draft document472 released by EPA in 1992 is a comprehensive technical document that assesses the state of scientific knowledge concerning the effects of TCDD and related compounds on human health . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , extremely technical and beyond the scope of this article , any evaluation of the health effects of dioxin must address the issues raised in this document . Therefore , a brief summary of the key findings reported in the eight draft Health Assessment chapters of this document is instructive . Overall , while this document represents the most recent findings , it reaches no final conclusion and it indicates the continuing uncertainty surrounding the dioxin issue . Chapter 1 . Disposition and Pharmacokinetics . <p> The disposition and pharmacokinetics of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and related compounds were investigated in several species and under various exposure conditions . The major focus of the study concerned the absorption and bioavailability following exposure through diet ( i.e. , gastrointestinal absorption ) or skin contact ( i.e. , dermal absorption ) because they represent potential routes for human exposure to this class of persistent environmental contaminants . <p> The first major source of human exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and related compounds is the diet. 473 Oral exposure of humans to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and related compounds was reported as a complex mixture of these contaminants in food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to alter absorption. 474 Gastrointestinal absorption studies on animals and humans showed significant variability , and often depended on a number of factors beyond the scope of this article . <p> The second major source of human exposure is dermal absorption . dermal exposure of humans to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and related compounds typically occurs as a complex mixture of these contaminants in soil , oils or other mixtures which would be expected to alter absorption. 475 Like gastrointestinal absorption , rates of dermal adsorption varied considerably among species , including humans , and this subject is beyond the scope of this article . <p> Following absorption , TCDD and related compounds are distributed in blood and lymph by binding to components in blood to enable them to diffuse through blood vessels and tissue membranes. 476 Once absorbed into blood , TCDD and related compounds readily distribute to all organs , 477 although within several hours the liver , adipose tissue , and skin become the primary sites of disposition. 478 <p> Distribution of TCDD and related compounds is also time dependent . In general , these compounds are cleared rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , adipose tissue and other tissues within the first hour(s) after exposure. 479 This is typically followed by redistribution to the liver and adipose tissue , which exhibit increasing tissue concentrations over several days after exposure. 480 Elimination from tissues thereafter occurs at rates that are dependent on other factors and are congener ( related dioxin-like compounds ) , tissue , and species specific. 481 Thus , the ratio of the concentrations of TCDD and related compounds in different tissues may not remain constant over an extended time period following a single exposure . <p> Although early studies were unable to detect the metabolism and excretion of TCDD , there is now evidence that this can occur. 482 Recent data regarding fecal samples from humans suggest that humans can metabolize 2,3,7,8-TCDD , 483 and data is available demonstrating that other organisms , such as rats , mice , guinea pigs , and hamsters can metabolize TCDD as well as other congeners. 484 The metabolism of TCDD and related compounds is required for urinary and biliary elimination and , therefore , plays a significant role in regulating the rate of excretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detoxification process , 485 whereby the metabolites formed are significantly less toxic than the parent compound(s) . Studies of excretion in humans ( as well as animals ) indicate that 2,3,7,8-TCDD is exceedingly persistent , with half-lives of TCDD or other congeners ranging from 0.8 to 10 years. 486 <p> The elimination of TCDD through mother 's milk can result in high exposure levels in infants . High levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD have been detected in the milk of mothers exposed to high levels of that compound in the environment. 487 In addition , the sex of the animal , pregnancy , and/or route of exposure could have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of TCDD and related compounds. 488 Further , the results of various studies concerning aging indicate that TCDD is absorbed to a greater degree through the skin of very young animals and that a significant decrease in potential for systemic exposure may occur during maturation and again during aging. 489 <p> Finally , physiologically-based pharmacokinetic ( PB-PK ) models490 have been developed for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in mice , rats and humans . These models have been effectively used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target species . In summary , these models have predicted results that approximate those found in actual studies , and may in the future prove valuable in assessing risks associated with the various parameters described above . Chapter 2 . Mechanisms of Toxic Actions . <p> The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD has generated worldwide concern because of its wide-spread distribution , its persistence , its accumulation within the food chain , and its toxic potency in experimental animals. 491 Epidemiological studies , however , have not produced a well-defined estimate of the risk that dioxin poses to human health. 492 For the future , knowledge of the mechanism of TCDD action may facilitate the risk assessment process by imposing constraints upon the assumptions used to estimate an acceptable exposure to dioxin. 493 <p> The challenge for risk assessment is to understand more fully the biochemical and genetic factors mediating the effects of dioxin in order to make it possible to set limits on acceptable human exposure . Given TCDD 's widespread distribution , persistence and accumulation within the food chain , it is likely that most humans are exposed to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk is multi-dimensional , and individuals are likely to vary in their susceptibility to dioxin , either because of genetic differences or because of exposure to other chemicals. 495 Further analyses of the mechanism of dioxin action may lead to methods of identifying those individuals who are especially at risk from exposure to TCDD. 496 For now , the paucity of information about the structure and function of the receptor497 which affects the biological response to dioxin represents the major barrier to a more complete understanding of the mechanism of dioxin action . In the future , a more complete understanding of the biochemical and genetic aspects of dioxin action should provide more insight into the mechanisms by which TCDD and related compounds produce birth defects , cancer and other public health concerns . Chapter 3 . Acute , Subchronic , and Chronic Toxicity . <p> The acute , subchronic , and chronic toxicology of the chlorinated dioxins , dibenzonfurans , biphenyl and related compounds has been the subject of recent reviews. 498 Chapter 3 summarizes the scientific community 's knowledge of the toxicology of TCDD from experimental animal data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general conclusions of this chapter are briefly summarized below . Based on the reported studies , for acute toxicity , the range of doses for TCDD which are lethal to animals varied extensively both with species and strain , as well as with the sex , age , and the route of administration. 499 Typically , there is a delayed toxicity , with the time to death after exposure usually being several weeks. 500 However , deaths within the first week after exposure have been observed in some experimental animal groups. 501 <p> TCDD affects a variety of organ systems in different species , with the liver , thymus , and lymphatic tissues the most sensitive markers of toxicity. 502 However , it is not possible to specify a single organ whose dysfunction accounts for the lethality. 503 Dermal effects are prominent signs of toxicity in subhuman primates , and the formation of cutaneous lesions closely mimics the chloracne and hyperkeratosis observed in humans. 504 <p> Loss of body weight ( wasting syndrome ) is a characteristic sign observed in most animals given a lethal dose of TCDD. 505 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after exposure and results in substantial reduction of adipose and muscle tissue. 506 <p> Finally , studies in some species indicate that the sensitivity to acute toxicity of TCDD segregates with the Ah locus. 507 In addition , other studies with other dioxins and PCBs demonstrate that the potency for inducing lethality correlates with their ability to bind to the Ah receptor. 508 <p> For subchronic toxicity , the various studies overall are in agreement with those observed after administration of a single dose. 509 In addition , the limited data available indicates that signs and symptoms of subchronic toxicity follow the same rank order as Ah receptor-mediated effects. 510 <p> Finally , various long-term studies on TCDD indicate species-specific exposure levels leading to chronic toxicity. 511 Note that adverse effects have been observed at the lowest dose tested ( roughly 2-3 ng/kg body weight ) . 512 <p> In summary , despite all the attention on this subject , the key event(s) underlying the mechanisms of toxicity have yet to be elucidated. 513 TCDD toxicity involves a variety of symptoms which vary from species to species and from tissue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and sex differences have been reported . Polymorphism in the Ah locus , which is speculated to be the structural gene for the receptor , seems to determine the sensitivity of experimental animals to TCDD and congeners. 515 Chapter 4 . Immunotoxic Effects . <p> Extensive evidence has been accumulated during the past two decades that demonstrate that the immune system is a target for toxicity of TCDD and structurally related halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons ( HAHs ) , including chlorinated dibenzofurans ( CDFs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and polybrominated biphenyls ( PBBs ) . 516 Generally , the evidence suggests that there are multiple cellular targets within the immune system that are altered by TCDD. 517 In parallel with the increased understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in immunity , TCDD studies are beginning to establish biochemical and molecular mechanisms of TCDD immunotoxicity. 518 <p> The elucidation of a genetic basis for sensitivity to the toxicity of TCDD and related compounds is a fertile area of research in the study of HAH toxicity. 519 Current thinking is that many of the biochemical and toxic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as the Ah or TCDD receptor. 520 The data relating HAH immunotoxicity , at least in part , to receptor-dependent events are convincing , but to date are not consistent across species. 521 And , despite numerous investigations , the specific cells that are altered by exposure to HAH leading to suppressed immune function have not been conclusively identified. 522 <p> Other TCDD effects are being analyzed . Results from host resistance studies provide evidence that exposure to TCDD results in increased susceptibility to bacterial , viral , parasitic and neoplastic disease. 523 These effects are observed at low doses and likely result from TCDD-induced suppression of immunological function. 524 There is also a reported increase in susceptibility of very young animals to HAH immunotoxicity following pre/neonatal exposure. 525 <p> Finally , the immunotoxicity of TCDD and related HAHs in humans has been the subject of numerous studies derived from accidental and/or occupational exposures to PCBs , PBBs , and TCDD. 526 <p> However , no clear pattern of immunotoxicity to HAH emerges from these studies in humans. 527 The basis for the lack of consistent , significant exposure-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , including : characteristics of the assays used to examine immune function in humans exposed to TCDD and related HAHs ; the use of data for individuals based on presumptive exposure rather than known , documented exposure ; and the time separation between actual exposure and the assessment of immune function. 528 Clearly , further well-controlled animal studies are needed to assist in the establishment of no effect levels and acceptable exposure levels for human risk assessment for TCDD . Chapter 5 . Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity . <p> 2,3,7,8-TCDD , one of seventy-five possible chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin ( CDD ) congeners , is one of the most potent of the compounds and serves as the prototype congener for investigating the toxicity of these classes of chemicals. 529 Reproductive and developmental toxicity is generally believed to be caused by the parent compound as there is no evidence that TCDD metabolites are involved. 530 However , humans are not exempt from the reproductive and developmental effects of complex HAH mixtures. 531 To date , the role of the Ah receptor mechanism , described above , 532 in producing signs of reproductive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown to affect female reproductive end points in a variety of animal studies , including reduced fertility , reduced litter size , and effects on the female gonads and menstrual/estrous cycle. 534 In males , TCDD and related compounds decrease testis and accessory sex organ weights , cause abnormal testicular morphology , decrease spermatogenesis , and reduce fertility when given to adult animals in doses sufficient to reduce feed intake and/or body weight. 535 <p> The results of developmental toxicity were divided into three categories for ease in assessing the data base with respect to an Ah-receptor mediated response : death/growth/clinical signs ; structural malformations ; and functional alterations. 536 Exposure related effects on death/growth/clinical signs along with structure activity results that are consistent with , but do not prove , an Ah-receptor mediated mechanism are described for a variety of test organisms537 and humans. 538 Developmental effects ( such as cleft palate , hydronephrosis539 and other structural malformations ) following exposure to halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxin , dibenzofuran and other compounds have been clearly demonstrated and provide the most convincing evidence of an Ah receptor-mediated response. 540 Susceptibility to the developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetus genotype and developmental stage at time of exposure. 541 Differences exist among mammalian species with respect to susceptibility to the developmental effects of TCDD. 542 With respect to the occurrence of similar developmental effects in mammalian species other than the mouse , for the most part no other species develops these structural malformations except at maternal doses that are fetotoxic and maternally toxic. 543 Studies in humans have not clearly identified an association between TCDD exposure and structural malformations. 544 <p> Postnatal functional alterations , such as on the male reproductive system , have also been demonstrated for some experimental animals. 545 It also appears that perinatal exposure to TCDD impairs sexual differentiation of the central nervous system which leads to demasculinization and feminization of sexual behavior. 546 The male reproductive system in rats is approximately 100 times more susceptible to TCDD toxicity when exposure occurs perinatally rather than in adulthood. 547 <p> The effects of TCDD on neurobehavior were also studied since the central nervous system is a highly differentiated tissue that derives from ectoderm during development. 548 The results of these studies on mice and monkeys demonstrated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behavioral developments of children transplacentally exposed to PCBs , CDFs , and other compounds were studied. 549 Effects such as developmental or psychomotor delay , speech problems , reduced scores on developmental and cognitive tests , and lagging intellectual development were shown. 550 These studies show that , in humans , transplacental exposure to HAHs can affect central nervous system function postnatally . Chapter 6 . Carcinogenicity of TCDD in Animals . <p> There is an ever increasing amount of scientific information relevant to the use of animal cancer data for the estimation of human risks than was available during the early studies in 1988. 551 However , much of the tumor incidence data in experimental rats and mice was available to show that TCDD is a carcinogen at multiple sites , including the occurrence of cancers following low doses. 552 New research confirms these findings for hamsters , and the data from early studies has been reevaluated . <p> In this chapter , new information from seventeen long-term ( chronic ) bioassays for carcinogenicity that were designed to determine if TCDD is a carcinogen in experimental animals demonstrate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) is a carcinogen in both sexes and in several species of experimental animals ; ( 3 ) is a carcinogen in sites remote from the site of treatment ; and ( 4 ) increases cancer incidence at doses well below the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) . 553 <p> This chapter notes that several studies in the past few years have provided increased understanding of the biochemistry of the carcinogenicity of TCDD in animals . A general consensus has emerged that most , if not all , of TCDD 's biochemical and toxic effects require interaction with the Ah receptor. 554 However , it is apparent that the formation of the Ah receptor-TCDD complex is but the first step of many in the production of a toxic effect. 555 The general consensus is that TCDD is an example of receptor-mediated carcinogenesis in that : ( 1 ) interaction with an Ah receptor appears to be a necessary early step ; ( 2 ) TCDD modifies a number of receptor and hormone systems involved in cell growth and differentiation ; and ( 3 ) hormones exert a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key issues in the risk assessment of TCDD and its related compounds include : ( 1 ) characterization of the shape of the dose-response curve for receptor-mediated events ; 557 ( 2 ) evaluation of the relevance of animal data in the estimation of human risks ; 558 and ( 3 ) the health consequences of background exposures of dioxin and its structural analogs. 559 Much of the controversy surrounding dioxin risk assessment reflects the selection of methods of analysis . Given the increased knowledge about the mechanism of dioxin action , the construction of biologically-based models which remove some of the uncertainty in current risk assessments may soon be possible . Overall , it appears that several studies indicate that in terms of biochemical and carcinogenic effects , humans apparently respond in a similar manner as experimental animals. 560 Chapter 7 . Epidemiology/Human Data . <p> A. Cancer Effects . <p> As noted in this chapter , while bioassay data from experimental animals provide substantial presumptive evidence of human carcinogenicity of TCDD , actual verification must , of course , come from human studies. 561 Based on the results from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyroid , lungs , skin and soft tissues . This chapter reports on the cancer epidemiology evidence of TCDD and its congeners . The original research reports are organized and discussed in four groups : ( 1 ) follow-up studies of chemical manufacturing and processing workers ; 562 ( 2 ) case-control studies in general populations ; ( 3 ) studies of pulp and paper mill workers ; and ( 4 ) other studies ( including studies of pesticide applicators , Vietnam veterans with potential exposure to Agent Orange , residents of Seveso , Italy exposed to TCDD during an accidental explosion , and victims of contaminated rice oil poisonings ) . 563 These are summarized below . <p> ( 1 ) Follow-up studies of chemical manufacturing and processing workers . <p> A study in the United States examined 5,172 persons who had worked at twelve plants involved in the production of chemicals contaminated with TCDD. 564 Follow-up began in 1940 or on the date of the first systematically documented assignment to a process involving TCDD contamination , whichever was later , and closed at the end of 1987. 565 Statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen percent of the workers had records of chloracne , the presence of which is an indicator of relatively intense exposure to TCDD ( or higher-chlorinated PCDDs as well ) . 566 Statistically significant results indicate that the group as a whole experienced an estimated fifteen percent elevation of mortality from all cancers combined , with a fifty percent elevation among those workers in a long duration/latency subgroup. 567 An excess of deaths from cancers of connective and soft tissues ( known as soft-tissue sarcomas or STSs ) was apparent. 568 A forty percent overall elevation in deaths from non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma was also observed. 569 Results for Hodgkin 's disease were highly imprecise , based on only three deaths . Lung cancer was elevated by ten percent overall and by forty percent in the long duration/latency subgroup. 570 A similar forty percent excess of stomach cancer in the subgroup was based on only four deaths ; no excess was observed in the total group. 571 <p> A German study utilized 1,583 males and females employed at a chemical manufacturing facility that produced 2,4,5-T and its precursor , 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. 572 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all cancers combined , concluded that " the increase in ( total ) cancer risk of 1.24-1.39 . . . can not be explained completely by confounding factors , and ... is associated with exposure to TCDD. " 573 Another smaller German study also reported an increased cancer risk of 1.2. 574 Other studies are reported , 575 but are not reviewed in any depth in this chapter . <p> ( 2 ) Case-control studies in general populations . <p> Case-control studies of soft-tissue sarcomas ( STSs ) and of malignant lymphomas are reported from Sweden , 576 the United States , 577 New Zealand , 578 and Italy. 579 <p> In summary , from the standpoint of exposures to TCDD , the most important results from general population case-control studies come from those conducted in Sweden and New Zealand. 580 These studies all were conducted in areas in which high proportions of phenoxy acid exposures involved 2,4,5-T. 581 For STSs , the Swedish studies indicated a relative risk of 2.3 for phenoxy acids among workers in agriculture , horticulture , and forestry. 582 The relative risk estimate of 3.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate that farming may be a confounder in the study. 583 <p> For malignant lymphomas , the case-control studies provide little evidence of a positive association. 584 Most of the studies ( New Zealand , Kansas , Nebraska , and Iowa and Minnesota ) indicate a small increase in risk , or no increase at all , from exposures to TCDD. 585 <p> ( 3 ) Studies of pulp and paper mill workers . <p> Three studies of pulp and paper mill workers are summarized. 586 These studies are important because of the potential for exposure to PCDDs in these occupations . These studies did not indicate appreciable increases in the risk of non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas , lung cancer , or stomach cancer among pulp and paper mill workers. 587 Overall , the rate of all cancers combined was lower than expected. 588 <p> ( 4 ) Other studies . <p> Studies of the distribution of TCDD levels in serum and adipose tissue of Vietnam veterans were indistinguishable from comparison populations except where the Vietnam veteran group was carefully defined on the basis of military records to have engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a small mortality study of 1,261 Air Force veterans who were responsible for aerial herbicide spraying missions ( known as Operation Ranch Hand ) in Vietnam. 590 A total of twenty-five cancer deaths were observed , for a relative risk of 1.1 . Rates of all specific cancers of interest were equal to or less than the rates in the comparison group. 591 <p> Another study examined residents of Seveso , Italy who were exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD from a chemical accident in 1976 . High exposures were indicated , with approximately 200 chloracne cases reported. 592 However , because the population has only been followed for ten years , results do not yet support a meaningful analysis of cancers. 593 To date , no excesses of mortality from lung cancer , stomach cancer , or all cancers combined , are apparent. 594 More meaningful information concerning cancer effects will not be available until additional time since first exposure has elapsed. 595 Finally , two incidents involving contamination of ingested food from PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDDs ) are discussed. 596 In 1968 , 1900 people ( termed the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of PCBs597 that had leaked into the rice oil at the canning facility . The victims suffered many ill effects from the single exposure ? The most significant finding was a greatly increased risk of liver cancer and of lung cancer in male victims. 599 In 1979 , a similar outbreak of illness was reported among 2,000 persons in Taiwan ( termed the " Yu-Cheng " incident ) . 600 This outbreak consisted of chloracne and other symptoms. 601 Non-cancer toxic effects resulting from the transplacental exposure to the cooking oil in children born to exposed mothers include : shorter and lighter children with developmental abnormalities , as well as developmental and behavioral deficiencies. 602 Information concerning cancer effects is not available due to inadequate time passage . <p> In conclusion , based on all the cancers examined in the studies described above , soft-tissue sarcomas ( STSs ) provide the strongest evidence of an association with TCDD. 603 The evidence on malignant lymphomas in connection with TCDD exposure is far less compelling , with evidence of increased risks for lung cancer and stomach cancer associated with TCDD exposure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briefly , the most frequently described effects on humans from exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD involve the skin , and liver and neurologic systems. 605 Other effects include disturbances of the gastrointestinal , genitourinary , endocrine , respiratory , cardiovascular , pulmonary , and immunologic systems , as well as increases in the incidence of some malignancies. 606 The majority of effects have been reported among occupationally-exposed groups. 607 These groups include chemical production workers , pesticide users , and individuals handling or exposed to materials that have been treated with **25;164;TOOLONG pesticides. 608 Chapter 8 . Dose-Response Relationships . <p> This chapter focuses on dose-response modeling for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. 609 Specifically , the chapter presents the current thinking on TCDD mechanistic action and focuses on dose-response models for cancer in experimental animals and humans . Although the details of this chapter are beyond the scope of this article , it is useful to summarize that , as evidenced by the discussion of the preceding chapters , considerable information is now available on the mechanisms of action responsible for TCDD 's effects in experimental animals and humans . However , there are several knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future experiments are essential to the development of reliable biologically-based models for the estimation of human risks associated with exposure to TCDD and related compounds . <p> + Copyright @ 1993 Arnold W.

Bottom ash is the heavier uncombusted or partially combusted material that accumulates in the incinerator . Fly ash from U.S. incinerators is about 15 to 30 percent by weight and 5 to 15 percent of the total ash . A range of metals and organic compounds is found in the ash . Volatile metals such as arsenic , mercury , lead , cadmium , and zinc tend to be more concentrated in fly ash . Less volatile metals such as aluminum , chromium , iron , nickel , and tin are more commonly concentrated in bottom ash . Organic chemicals such as dioxins and PCBs tend to be concentrated in fly ash . Other organics , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) tend to be found in bottom ash . MSW incinerator ash may contain higher concentrations of toxic material than coal ash . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfill , but EPA estimates that 17 percent of incinerator ash is commingled with MSW . However , the fate of much of the ash generated in the United States is unknown . The reason for concern is that ash often contains hazardous chemical constituents , which may leach out and contaminate surface or ground water . The presence of heavy metals is of particular public health concern . The incineration process does not destroy these hazardous constituents but rather concentrates and transforms them into a form that is more easily transported to , and assimilated by , humans , plants , and animals .

Chapter 2 describes the physical and chemical properties of the dioxin-like compounds . Chapter 4 presents the overall framework for conducting exposure assessments and discusses the use of Toxicity Equivalency Factors ( TEFs ) . Chapter 5 provides procedures for estimating concentrations of the dioxin-like compounds in exposure media resulting from soil contamination and nearby incinerators . Chapter 8 summarizes information about uptake and distribution of dioxin-like compounds in the human body and presents pharmacokinetic models to predict blood levels resulting from exposure . Chapter 10 discusses the sources and possible magnitude of uncertainty in the exposure assessment procedures . 403 EPA DRAFT EXPOSURE DOCUMENT , supra note 349 , at 3-1 .

Id . 404 Id . 405 Id . 406 Id . 407 Limited ambient air measurements have been carried out in selected cities in the U.S. and Europe . There are similarities with respect to the magnitude of specific congeners of PCDDs and PCDFs , and specific dioxin-like congeners are quantified from 1/10 to 1/100 picograms per cubic meter of air sample . Id . at 3-20. 408 General observations for PCDD and PCDF levels in soils based on the various reported data indicate that concentrations associated with industrial sites are the highest , with concentrations in the hundreds to thousands of parts per trillion ( ppt ) .

Id . 409 General observations indicate concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the parts per quadrillion ( ppq ) in surface waters . Id . 410 The studies indicate that the concentration patterns in sediments of PCDDs and PCDFs are usually the result of industrial combustion processes , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-12. 411 Fish and shellfish differ in their ability to bioconcentrate PCDD and PCDF congeners . Id . at 3-17 . For fish , the concentrations of PCDD and PCDF are dependent on exposure level , fat content , habitat , and amount of movement of the species . Id . Comparatively fat bottom-dwelling fish collected close to the contaminant source have the highest PCDD/PCDF levels , while leaner non-stationary fish have lower concentrations . Id . at 3-18. 412 The studies examined PCDD and PCDF levels in products of animal origin ( i.e. , fish , meat , eggs , and dairy products ) . The data indicate that these compounds are found at levels ranging from the intermediate parts per quadrillion ( ppq ) up to the low parts per trillion ( ppt ) range . Id . at 3-18. 413 Although there are historical and geographic differences in background exposure , a worldwide Toxic Equivalent Concentration ( TEq ) was determined to be in a range from 20-90 picograms per day .

Once the heat in the combustion gas was extracted for energy purposes , and the gases were further cooled to within the " window " of temperatures that promote dioxin formation on fly ash surfaces , then the total array of PCDDs and PCDFs could be detected . Id . at 6-9 . Thus , this series of experiments in which the mass balance of PCDD/PCDF was estimated for the entire combustion process discounts the theory that dioxin originally in the MSW accounts for dioxin emissions at the stack . Id . at 6-8 to 6-9. 420 Id . at 6-9 . Unlike the mechanism of formation of PCDDs and PCDFs , empirical data do not support a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-9 to 6-10. 421 Id . at 6-9 . The mass burn , heat recovery incinerator technology was selected . This technology dominates the existing and projected census of U.S. incinerators . The hypothetical incinerator was assumed to have a combined daily combustion capacity of 2,727 metric tons per day ( 3000 tons/day ) . EPA selected the stack height , diameter , exit velocity of the emissions , and temperature of the exhaust gases based on actual data from like facilities . The hypothetical facility was located in Tampa , Florida , a site characterized as a wet , humid geographical area where the MSW incineration industry is expected to grow significantly over the next 15 years . Id . at 6-16 to 6-11. 422 See id . at 6-12 to 6-25. 423 See id . The dioxin-like compounds are primarily associated with the fly ash ; negligible amounts of PCDDs/PCDFs have been detected on bottom ash from the combustion grate because these chemicals are synthesized outside the furnace region . Thus , combining fly ash with bottom ash prior to disposal typically dilutes the initial contaminant concentration , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom ash to fly ash is about 10:1 . Id . at 6-26. 424 Id . at 6-34 to 6-40. 425 Id . at 6-41 to 6-48. 426 Id . Ambient air concentrations at ground level of dioxin-like congeners are expressed in units of grams per cubic meter of air ( g/m 3 ) . Id . 427 Id . Surface deposition flux is expressed in units of grams per square meter per year ( g/m 2 x yr ) . Id . at 6-46. 428 Id . at 7-1 . In an exposure scenario evaluation , the concentrations of chemicals in a medium or location is determined and linked with the time that individuals or populations come in contact with the chemical(s) . Id . at 7-1. 429 See infra notes 403-13 and accompanying text . 430 Exposure is calculated as the potential dose normalized against body weight and lifetime . Id . at 7-3 . This value is computed as the lifetime average daily dose ( LADD ) for all exposure pathways where : <p> LADD = ( exposure media concentration x contact rate x contact fraction x exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Id . " Lifetime " refers to the expected lifetime of the exposed individuals ; EPA recommends using the U.S. average of 70 years for all pathways as a default value . Id . at 7-4 . " Body weight " refers to the average body weight of the exposed individuals over the exposure period ; EPA recommends using the U.S. average of 70 kg for all pathways involving adults , and 16 kg for children ingesting soil . Id . " Exposure media concentration " is the concentration of the chemical in the media of interest averaged over the time of exposure . Id . " Exposure duration " is the overall time period that individuals spend in situations that expose them to a contaminated media ; EPA recommends a range of 9 to 30 years . Id . " Contact rate " is the total rate of contact with the exposure media via ingestion , dermal contact , or inhalation . " Contact fraction " is the portion of contacted material that is contaminated .

To a much lesser degree , soft ingestion occurs in adults , but the data is sparse . Id . at 7-5 . EPA estimated soil ingestion for young children ( under age seven ) at approximately 0.1 to 0.2 grams per day . Id . at 7-6. 433 Three factors control soft dermal contact ( expressed in mg/year ) : the contact rate per soil contact event , the surface area of contact , and the number of dermal contact events per year . EPA provided the following ranges : contact rate  --  0.2 to 1.0 mg/cm 2 - event ; adult surface area-5,000 to 5,800 cm 2 ; and event frequency  --  40 to 350 events per year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited typical ventilation rates of 20 and 23 m 3 /day , and used 20 m 3 /day in the assessment . Id . at 7-7. 435 The water ingestion rate of 2 liters/day is traditionally used for exposure through drinking water . EPA considered this a high end value , however , and used 1.4 liters/day as representative of average adult drinking water consumption for purposes of this assessment . Id . at 7-8. 436 EPA used an average beef fat consumption rate of 22 grams/day and an average milk fat consumption rate of 10.5 grams/day . Id . at 7-9 . It should be noted that if contaminated beef and dairy products from one source are marketed along with uncontaminated products from another source , only a small percent of the beef and dairy consumed by an individual may be contaminated . Id . This " market dilution " can introduce much uncertainty in human exposure assessments . 437 EPA used judgment concerning fish consumption rate data and used rates of 1.2 grams/day for central estimates , and 4.1 grams/day for high end estimates . Id . at 7-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as average amounts of fruit and vegetable consumption , respectively . Id . at 7-11 . Note that EPA distinguished between above-ground unprotected and below-ground unprotected categories for each category of exposure . Id . at 9-1. 439 Id . at 9-1. 440 Here , the source of contamination is soil and both the source and exposure site are on the same tract of land .

Complex TCDD-induced effects ( e.g. , cancer ) likely are the result of multiple steps and involve several genetic and/or environmental factors . Thus , only certain individuals may be at risk from exposure to TCDD , either because of their particular genetic makeup and/or their exposure to other chemicals . 496 Id . at 2-15 to 2-16. 497 Based on numerous studies , it is apparent that , given the extraordinary potency of TCDD in eliciting toxic effects , a receptor for dioxin exists . Biochemical and genetic evidence implicate the TCDD-binding protein  --  known as the Ah ( dioxin ) receptor  --  in the biological response to dioxin . Id . at 2-3 . A summary of the biochemistry and function of the Ah receptor at the molecular level is beyond the scope of this article , but is fully described .

However , the role of the putative receptor requires further elucidation , and the available data suggests that the receptor for TCDD may be a prerequisite , but is not sufficient in itself for the mediation of toxicity . Id . at 3-33. 516 U.S. EPA , HEALTH ASSESSMENT FOR **35;450;TOOLONG ( TCDD ) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS 4  --  1 ( 1992 ) . This evidence was derived from numerous studies in various animal species , primarily rodents , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cattle . Id . Epidemiological studies also provide evidence for the immunotoxicity of HAHs in humans . Id . 517 Id . at 4-2. 518 Id . 519 Id . at 4-3 . This area may one day provide a logical explanation for much of the controversial data regarding HAH toxicity among different species and in different tissues within a species . Id . 520 Id . The speculation is that the process is similar to that of steroid hormone receptor-mediated responses . Id . Two lines of evidence have been used to investigate the All receptor-dependence of the acute immunotoxicity of TCDD and related HAH : ( 1 ) comparative studies using CDD , CDF and PCB congeners that differ in their binding affinity for the Ah receptor ; and ( 2 ) studies using genetically different mice that are known to differ at the Ah locus . Id . at 4-4. 521 Id . at 4-9 . Based on the available data from mice , the majority of the immunotoxic effects of HAH appear to be mediated via the Ah receptor . Id . at 4-11. 522 Id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 525 Id . at 4-27. 526 Id . at 4-33 . Immunotoxic effects were described in Taiwanese patients who consumed acnegenic and hepatotoxic doses of PCDF-PCB contaminated rice oil in 1979 and in Michigan dairy farmers exposed to PBBs via contaminated dairy products and meat in 1973 . Id . Clinical symptoms included respiratory tract and skin infections and reduced T-cell levels in blood . Id . In addition , another study reported the findings from immunologic assessment of 41 individuals from Missouri with documented adipose tissue levels of TCDD resulting from occupational , recreational or residential exposure . Id . at 4-34 . Here , no adverse clinical disease was associated with TCDD levels in these subjects . See.id . In addition , in a study on the immune status of 44 children , 20 of whom had chloracne , that were exposed to TCDD following an explosion at a herbicide factory in Seveso , Italy , no specific health problems were correlated with dioxin exposure in these children .

The toxic potency of TCDD is due to the number and position of chlorine substitutions on the dibenzo-p-dioxin molecule . Id . CDD congeners with decreased lateral or increased non-lateral chlorine and bromine substitutes are less potent than TCDD . Id . 531 Id . A mechanism of action which CDD , BDD , CDF , BDF , PCB , and PBB congeners substituted in the lateral position have in common is that they bind to the Ah receptor which then binds to a translocating protein that carries the activated TCDD receptor complex into the cell 's nucleus . These activated TCDD receptor complexes bind to specific sequences of DNA ( referred to as dioxin-responsive enhancers or DREs ) , resulting in alterations of gene transcription . Id . at 5-2. 532 See supra note 497 and accompanying text . 533 See supra note 531 , at 5-2. 534 Id . at 5-2. 535 Id . at 5-11. 536 Id . at 5-14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of fish appear to he more sensitive to TCDD-induced mortality than adults . This is suggested by the LD 50 of TCDD in rainbow trout sac fry ( 0.4 ug/kg egg weight ) being 25 times less than that in juvenile rainbow trout ( 10 ug/kg body weight ) . Id . TCDD is directly toxic to early life stages of fish as demonstrated by Japanese medaka , pike , rainbow trout , and lake trout exposed as fertilized eggs to graded concentrations of waterborne TCDD . Id . Lake trout are the most sensitive of fish species to TCDD developmental toxicity . Id . at 5-16 . Although the Ah receptor has not been identified in early life stages of fish , it is presumed to be present based on inducement experiments . Id . The Ah receptor has been identified in some adult fish species . Id . <p> Bird embryos are also more sensitive to TCDD toxicity than adults . The LD 50 of TCDD in chicken embryos ( 0.25 ug/kg egg weight ) is 100-200 times less than the TCDD dose that causes mortality in adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also evidence in chicken embryos that the Ah receptor may be involved in producing developmental toxicity . Id . at 5-17 . <p> Laboratory animals exposed to TCDD during adulthood display wide differences in the LD 50 of TCDD . Id . at 5-20 . It appears that the magnitude of the species differences in lethal potency of TCDD is affected by the timing of TCDD exposure during the life history of the animal . Id . at 5-21 . Exposures to TCDD during pregnancy cause prenatal mortality in the monkey , guinea pig , rabbit , rat , hamster , and mouse . Id . The structure activity relationship for developmental toxicity in laboratory mammals is generally similar to that for Ah receptor binding . Id . at 5-29 . <p> 538 Developmental toxicity has been reported in human babies born to affected mothers who consumed rice oil contaminated with PCBs , CDFs and others . Id . at 5-29 . High mortality was observed among infants born to affected mothers who themselves did not experience increased mortality . Id . at 5-30 . Thus , in humans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mortality caused by HAHs . Id . In most cases , women who had affected children had chloracne themselves . Id . <p> Effects of chemical exposure on normal development of the human fetus can have four outcomes depending on the dose and time during gestation when exposure occurs : fetal death , growth retardation , structural malformations , and organ system dysfunction . Id . 539 In mice , hydronephrosis is the most sensitive developmental response elicited by TCDD , and is characterized as a progressive occurrence in the right kidney which can be accompanied by hydroureter and/or abnormal nephron development . Id . at 5-44 to 5-45. 540 Id . at 5-32 to 5-47 . These compounds bind stereospecifically to the Ah receptor as shown in several studies . Id . at 5-37 to 5-44. 541 Id . at 5-32 . As noted above , the Ah receptor is thought to mediate the developmental effects of TCDD . Id . 542 Id . at 5-33. 543 Id . at 5-35 .

TCDD exposure is expected to have a great impact on the male reproductive system in rats during early development . Id . at 5-47 . For example , decreased spermatogenesis was among the most sensitive responses of the male rat reproductive system to perinatal TCDD exposure . Id . at 5  --  51 . Although perinatal TCDD exposure had little or no effect on fertility of male rats or on survival and growth of offspring , it is known that rats produce and ejaculate ten times more sperm than are necessary for normal fertility and litter size . Id . at 5-55 . Note that , in contrast , reproductive efficiency in human males is very low with the number of sperm per ejaculate being close to that required for fertility . Thus , a percent reduction in daily sperm production for humans , similar in magnitude to that observed in rats , may reduce fertility .

The details of these studies are beyond the scope of this article . 554 Id . at 6-1 . The properties of the Ah receptor and the mechanisms whereby this receptor regulates gene expression are the subject of other chapters and are discussed elsewhere . See supra notes 497 , 507-10 and accompanying text . 555 Id . at 6-2. 556 Id . at 6-37. 557 The evaluation of dose-response is one of the most important issues associated with dioxin risk assessment . Apparently the focus of the studies centers on whether the effects of dioxin will exhibit a threshold or not . Id . at 6-2 . For some responses , there is a proportional relationship between receptor occupancy and response as evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide dose range . Id . However , it is clear from animal studies that there are different dose-response curves for different TCDD effects which is consistent with the general timings for steroid receptor-mediated responses . Id . at 6-38 . Thus , it is inappropriate to use a single marker to estimate dioxin 's risks . Id . at 6-2 . Finally , the data indicate that there is no common dose-response relationship for all Ah receptor-mediated responses . Id . 558 Whether experimental animal models are relevant for estimating human risks is a very controversial area in risk assessment . Id . at 6-2 . Recently , there has been increasing evidence that biochemical and toxic responses resulting from exposure of humans to TCDD and related compounds appear to be similar to the responses seen in animal experiments . However , the mechanistic basis for interindividual variation has not been ascertained , and this lack of knowledge complicates approaches to estimating human risks from experimental animal data . Id . at 6-38. 559 Id . at 6-37 to 6-38. 560 Id . at 6-38 . However , data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any , from background TCDD exposures are not known .

As stated in the chapter , a major weakness in almost all studies is the lack of reliable exposure information . Most studies rely on interviews and questionnaires of work history to ascertain exposure surrogates . There is little , if any , verification of actual internal exposure to these compounds . Id . at 7-2. 564 Id . at 7-7. 565 Id . 566 Id . 567 Id . at 7-8 . Among the total 5,172 workers , special attention was paid to results for 3,036 workers who were followed at least 20 years after the first exposure . This group was divided into those with less than one year exposure ( n=1,516 ) and those with more than one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year exposure are referred to as the " long duration/latency " subgroup . Id . 568 Id . Note that these results were based on only four deaths ( and three deaths for the long duration/latency subgroup ) from two different plants . Id . 569 Id . 570 Id . at 7-8 . Confounding by cigarette smoking must be considered in interpreting the approximate 40 percent excess of lung cancer deaths in the long duration/latency subgroup . Id . at 7-9 . This leads to the conclusion that cancers of the respiratory tract may result from exposure to TCDD , although the possibility of contribution from factors such as smoking and exposure to other industrial chemicals can not be excluded . Id . 571 Id . at 7-8. 572 Id . at 7-10 . In 1954 , a chloracne outbreak occurred in the working population of the plant . Subsequently , production of the TCDD contaminant was reduced . Study group members worked at least three months from 1952 through 1984 . Follow-up presumably began on the date of accumulation of three months of employment and closed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West German population ( and with a group of workers at a gas supply company , although these data are not reported because there were no material differences between the analyses ) . Id . 573 Id . at 7-11 ( quoting Manz et al. , Cancer Mortality Among Workers in Chemical Plant Contaminated With Dioxin , 338 LANCET , 959  --  64 ( 1991 ) ) . For the group , estimated relative risk of lung cancer was 1.4 and relative risk of stomach cancer was 1.2 . Id . It is interesting to note , albeit inconclusive , that the relative risk for breast cancer among the female workers was 2.2 . See id . at 7-12. 574 Id . at 7-12. 575 Another ten-country historical study was conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) . This study looked at cancer mortality in 18,390 production workers or sprayers exposed to chlorophenoxy herbicides and/or chlorophenols . Exposure was reconstructed through questionnaires , factory or spraying records , and job histories . Id . at 7-13 . Although increased cancer risks were observed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the author 's confidence to make conclusions . Id . at 7-14 . In addition , Danish and British scientists conducted studies of exposed workers , but again exposure information was not sufficient to permit reasonable interpretations . Id . at 7-15 to 7-16. 576 In northern Sweden , most exposures occurred in the use of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D in combination in forestry applications , often by knapsack spraying . Id . at 7-18 . Phenoxy acid exposures not involving 2,4,5-T were proportionally more common in the central and southern regions in which agricultural herbicide uses predominated . Id . 577 Researchers at the National Cancer Institute reported results from three case-control studies in four Great Plains states ( Kansas , Nebraska , Iowa and Minnesota ) . Id . at 7-23 , 7-24 . Only the study in eastern Nebraska suggests an increase in risk due to 2,4,5-T . Id . at 7-24 . Another study of STSs and non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas was conducted in western Washington state . Id . <p> The results of this study show no association between soft-tissue sarcomas or non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas and estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors did report , however , that the relative risk of non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas associated with more than 15 years of potential exposure to phenoxy acids increased with time since the accumulation of that exposure . The relative risk estimates were 1.3 for exposures more than five years before diagnosis , 1.7 for more than 15 years , and 2.5 for more than 25 years . Similar trends were not observed in any analyses of STSs and phenoxy acids or of either cancer in connection with chlorophenol exposure . <p> Id . at 7-25 . It is noted that the major problem with the U.S. case-control studies is that specific exposure to TCDD and related compounds is not identified or quantified . Id . at 7-26. 578 Two studies of SRSs and one study of non-Hedgkin 's lymphomas among men were conducted in New Zealand . Id . at 7-26 .

Id . The authors of the study emphasized that herbicide spraying is a full-time occupation in New Zealand and that none of the SRS or malignant lymphoma cases were commercial sprayers . Id . at 7-28 to 7-29 . Relative risk estimates ranged from 1.3 for any " potential " exposure to 1.6 for exposures ( " definite or probable " for phenoxy acids , " potential " for chlorophenols ) lasting more than one day and occurring more than five years prior to diagnosis . Id . at 7-27 to 7-28 . The estimated relative risk was 3.0 among farmers for phenoxy acid exposures . Id . at 7-28. 579 Researchers conducted a case-control study of SRSs in three provinces in northern Italy . Phenoxy acid exposure classifications were based on job information provided in interviews or questionnaires . Id . at 790 . Although the authors implied that phenoxy acid herbicides of all types ( 2,4-D , 2,4,5-T , and MCPA ) were used in the area during the crucial time period , they were only able to document use of 2,4-D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impurities . Id . Thus , this study appears to have limited relevance to concerns for TCDD exposures . Id . The study indicated an inverse association between possible or certain phenoxy acid exposure and SRS risk among men , and a positive association among women . Id . Rice is the principal agricultural crop in the study area , and rice weeding was predominately a female occupation . Rice weeding during this period ( 1950-55 ) was manual and contact with the phenoxy herbicides was mainly dermal . Id . at 7-31 . Among all women in the study , rice weeding during the early 1950s is associated with a relative risk of 2.3 . Id . 580 Id . at 7-31. 581 Id . Moreover , for most of these studies , available data allow analyses restricted to farmers and other occupational categories within which the relevant exposures predominantly occur . Id . 582 Id . 583 Id . Indirect standardization for farming reduces the relative risk to 1.9 .
