DO N'T TRY THIS AT HOME PLATE <P> Over the years , baseball players have devised numerous ways to outsmart umpires : corking the bat , throwing spitballs , using steroids . But amazingly , until last week , no one had tried the fake mustache . The ingenious ploy was hatched by New York Mets manager BOBBY VALENTINE after being thrown out of a game for arguing with the plate umpire . Once ejected , players and managers are forbidden to go back into the dugout , but that 's exactly where a camera spotted Valentine . Even sporting facial hair , shades and a hat , Valentine was recognized by officials , who later suspended him for two games and fined him $5,000 . Valentine will appeal the suspension , claiming he was only near the dugout and meant no disrespect . " I did it to lighten up the team , " he said . And it looks as if for two games at least the team will be one manager lighter . <P> TITLE GONE , SELF-RESPECT INTACT <P> In the nuanced arena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Wrestling Federation 's women 's champion , a leather-clad SABLE subdued opponents in front of lusty fans and posed for Playboy . But the real-life wife and mother balked at what she claims were the league 's requests for her to expose her breasts and participate in lesbian story lines . Sable alleges that her resistance led to her scripted defeat in the ring earlier this month . Now she has sued the WWF for $110 million , saying the sport has become " obscene , titillating , vulgar and unsafe . " A WWF lawyer says Sable 's suit is a " smear job " and will be " vigorously defended . " Presumably in a court of law . <P> AND SHE WILL ALWAYS LOVE COUTURE <P> Life was so much simpler for ' 60s pop stars . When Carole King went on tour , she packed a poncho and jumped on a bus . Today singers wo n't hit the road without consulting pyrotechnic experts and an army of stylists . When WHITNEY HOUSTON kicks off her tour June 22 , she 'll bring trunk loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabbana . For each song , there is a fashion : gowns for ballads and edgy sportswear for up-tempo numbers . Alas , Whitney sings no zydeco . <P> ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT <P> WHO : OLIVER STONE <P> OCCUPATION : Film director <P> OFFENSE : Stone , 52 , was arrested in Beverly Hills last week for suspicion of drunk driving and possession of hashish . He was released after posting $12,500 bail . <P> WHY THIS SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISING : His vocal and repeated iteration of conspiracy theories ; his inclusion of unnecessarily long , trippy music numbers in his film The Doors ; he 's worked with Woody Harrelson , perhaps the only owner of a hemp tuxedo.
