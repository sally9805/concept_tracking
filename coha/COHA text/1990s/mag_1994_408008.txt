Seven families have braved the evening 's bad weather to attend the inaugural meeting of a new babysitting co - op . Chairs are arranged in a circle for the adults , and toys and crayons have been provided for the kids . The spacious church meeting hall invites more boisterous play , however , and soon the grownups have pulled their chairs closer together in an attempt to hear each other . There 's lots to talk about : tonight their co - op is to progress from a great idea to an organized , functioning group . How do you start a babysitting co - op ? Edna Latone , the mover and shaker behind this meeting , began with a circle of friends at her church . " I read about the idea in a magazine , and when I mentioned it to my friends they all got really excited and encouraged me to get it going . So then I went to the leadership at our church to see if it was OK to put a notice in the bulletin , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guidelines  --  and some experienced advice  --  from her local parent - child resource centre helped Edna with the initial organizing . While the concept of a babysitting co - op is simple  --  members exchange babysitting time , rather than money  --  a number of details need to be worked out if the co - op is to run smoothly . Who is eligible to join ? What are the responsibilities of the members ? How will they keep track of hours used and given ? When the families who signed up through the church bulletin arrived at this meeting , Edna had some of the structure already in place . Each member family was asked to complete a profile form that included information such as the children 's names , ages and health - card numbers ; any medical concerns or special needs ; availability to babysit ; and family pets . These forms , a phone list , and six lime - green tickets ( each representing one hour 's babysitting ) would be mailed  --  along with operating rules developed by the group that night  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , though , there are details to talk through . How much notice is needed ? Short notice is okay , the group decides , as long as it 's understood that members have the right to decline , with no explanation required . What about emergencies ? A simple protocol is worked out . Discipline ? The group agrees that spanking other people 's children is not appropriate , but leaves other discipline issues to be worked out between the families . Members agree to meet again in a month to work out any other issues that arise as they get rolling . Then they head for the cookies and coffee , taking the opportunity to get to know each other a little better . That 's a good idea , because co - op members will only call on each other if they feel comfortable together . " Babysitting co - ops do n't work with strangers , " stresses Elaine Lenehan , whose own co - op has been operating for more than 13 years . " You need a relationship of trust . " Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Toronto street , who first forged their friendship in a weekly playgroup . Over the years , co - op membership has grown to 15 families  --  but each new member has been sponsored and introduced by an existing member . Figure not transcribed Elaine 's co - op uses blue , red and white poker chips to represent half - hour , hour , and four - hour " assignments . " ( Each new member starts with 20 hours ' worth of chips . ) Special rates govern overnight or weekend sitting . And members can also use the chips to " buy " skills or household labour ( typing a resume , cleaning an oven ) . " We 've had housecleaning " bees , " where one parent babysat the kids while the rest of us cleaned someone 's entire house , " says Elaine . Elaine acknowledges that babysitting co - ops are most practical for families where one parent is at home much of the time . When their own family time is at a premium , she explains , parents are often reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for her , the co - op has been a great experience  --  and the fact that " it 's a real moneysaver " has turned out to be the least of it : " It was so easy and relaxed to go out . Our kids had so much fun , they really looked forward to those times . And we made lasting friendships with the other families . We really cared for one another . " Not that there were n't a few glitches to be worked out : " When we first started , one mom was often available to babysit , but she never went anywhere herself , " recalls Elaine . " At one point , our economy flooded out  --  she had all the tokens , and we had none ! " Edna 's new coop members will likely face a few growing pains , too . They have n't figured out , for example , whether they should pay one or two tokens for 1 hours of child care . And they have n't really tested out how compatible their child - rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with each other may find that they , too , are reaping unexpected rewards  --  such as really getting to know other people 's children . Few parents who join a co - op see their required " babysitting duty " as one of the benefits . But Elaine sees it differently . My extended family now lives overseas , " explains Elaine . " Through the co - op we were able to care for each other 's children as though they were our nieces and nephews . When I see the children  --  teenagers now , some of them  --  that I used to babysit when they were really small , I feel like I was part of their life , because I invested something positive in them .
