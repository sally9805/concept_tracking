The calm , early-summer afternoon that " in the flash of a moment would be shattered by gunfire " - the newspaper writer expressed it this way-had been unremarkable for the Blakelys : like the other " returning commuters " ( the newspaper writer again ) , they were sitting in traffic , in the heat , with jazz playing on the radio , saying little to each other , staring out . Exactly as it usually was on the ride home from work . Neither of them felt any particular pressure to speak . The music played , and they did not quite hear it . Both were tired , both had been through an arduous day 's work-Michael was an office clerk in the university 's admissions office , and Ivy was a receptionist in the office of the Dean of Arts and Sciences . <p> " Is this all right ? " she said to him , meaning what was on the radio . <p> " Excuse me ? " he said . <p> " This music . I could look for something else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind it . " <p> She sat back and gazed out her window at a car full of young children . All of them seemed to be singing , but she could n't hear their voices . The car in which they were riding moved on ahead a few lengths , and was replaced by the tall side of a truck . Jake Plumbly &; Son , Contractors . <p> " I guess I 'm in the wrong lane again , " he said . <p> " No . They 're stopped , too , now . " <p> He sighed . <p> " Everybody 's stopped again , " she said . <p> They sat there . <p> She brought a magazine out of her purse and paged through it , then set it down on her lap . She looked at her husband , then out at the road . Michael sat with his head back on the seat top , his hands on the bottom curve of the wheel . The music changedsome piano piece which seemed tuneless , for all the notes running up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brushes . <p> She looked at the magazine . Staring at a bright picture of little girls in a grass field , she remembered something unpleasant , and turned the page with an impatient suddenness that made him look over at her . <p> " What ? " he said . <p> She said , " Hmm ? " <p> He shrugged , and stared ahead . <p> No ongoing conflict or source of unrest existed between them . <p> But something was troubling her . It had happened that on a recent occasion a new acquaintance had expressed surprise upon finding out that they had been married only seven months . This person 's embarrassed reaction to the discovery had made Ivy feel weirdly susceptible . She had lain awake that night , hearing her new husband 's helpless snoring , and wondering about things which it was not normally in her temperament to consider . In that unpleasant zone of disturbed silence , she could n't get rid of the sense that her life had been decided for her in some quarter far away from her own small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the dark , thinking-though she had done no more and no less than exactly what she wanted to do for many years now . She was thirty-three . She had lived apart from her family for a dozen years , and if Michael were a mistake , she was the responsible party : she had decided everything . <p> Through the long hours of that night , she arrived at this fact over and over , like a kind of resolution , only to have it dissolve into forms of unease that kept her from drifting off to sleep . It seemed to her that he had been less interested in her of late , or could she have imagined this ? It was true enough that she sometimes caught herself wondering if he were not already taking her for granted , or if there were someone else he might be interested in . There was an element of his personality that remained somehow distant , that he actively kept away from her , and from everyone , it seemed . At times , in fact , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhappy . They got along fine as a couple . Yet on occasion , she had to admit , she caught herself wondering if she made any impression at all on him . When she looked over at him in the insular stillness of his sleep , the thought blew through her that anything might happen . What if he were to leave her ? This made her heart race , and she turned in the bed , trying to put her mind to other things . <p> How utterly strange , to have been thinking about him in that daydreaming way , going over the processes by which she had decided upon him as though this were what she must remember in order to believe the marriage safe , only to discover the fear-it actually went through her like fear-that he might decide to leave her , that she would lose him , that perhaps something in her own behavior would drive him away . <p> In the light of the morning , with the demands of getting herself ready for work , the disturbances of her sleepless hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to believe . She had been raised to be active , and not to waste time indulging in unhealthy thoughts , and she was not the sort of person whose basic confidence could be undermined by a single bad night , bad as that night was . <p> She had told herself this , and she had gone on with things , and yet the memory of it kept coming to her in surprising ways , like a recurring ache . <p> She had not wanted to think of it here , in the stopped car , with Michael looking stricken , his head lying back , showing the little white place on his neck where a dog had bitten him when he was nine years old . Just now , she needed him to be wrapped in his dignity , posed at an angle that was pleasing to her . <p> She reached over and touched his arm . <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . Just patting you . " <p> He lay his head back again . In the next moment she might tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt ( it would cover the little scar ) . She could feel the impulse traveling along her nerves . <p> She looked out the window and reflected that something had tipped over inside her , and she felt almost dizzy . She closed her eyes and opened them again . Abruptly , her mind presented her with an image of herself many years older , the kind of wife who was always hectoring her husband about his clothes , his posture , his speech , his habits , his faltering , real and imagined , always identifying deficiencies . It seemed to her now that wives like that were only trying to draw their husbands out of a reserve that had left them , the wives , marooned . <p> " What 're you thinking ? " she said . <p> He said , " I 'm not thinking . " <p> She sought for something funny or light-hearted to say , but nothing suggested itself . She opened the magazine again . Here were people bathing in a blue pool , under a blue sky . <p> " Wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for him to see . <p> He glanced over at the picture , then fixed his attention on the road ahead . He was far away , she knew . <p> " Is something wrong ? " she said . <p> " Not a thing , " he told her . <p> Perhaps he was interested in someone else . She rejected the thought as hysterical , and paged through the magazine-all those pictures of handsome , happy , complacently self-secure people . <p> Someone nearby honked his horn . Someone else followed suit ; then there were several . This tumult went on for a few seconds , then subsided . The cars in front inched ahead , and Michael eased up on the brake to let the car idle an increment forward , closing the distance almost immediately . <p> He said , " I read somewhere that they expect it to be worse this week , because the high schools are all letting out for summer . " <p> They stared ahead at the lines of waiting cars , three choked lanes going off to the blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had again wandered away from where she was . And she had been thinking about him . This seemed almost spooky to her . She started to ask what he had said , but then decided against it , not wanting really to spend the energy it would take to listen , and experiencing a wave of frustration at the attention she was having to pay to every motion of her own mind . <p> " How could it be worse ? " he said . <p> She made a murmur of agreement , remarking to herself that soon he was going to have to turn the car 's air conditioning off , or the engine might overheat . She looked surreptitiously at the needle on the temperature gauge ; it was already climbing toward the red zone . Perhaps she should say something . <p> But then there was the sudden commotion in the street , perhaps four cars up-some people had gotten out of two of the cars , and were scurrying and fighting , it looked like . It was hard to tell with the blaze of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , almost glad of the change . <p> He had n't seen it yet . He had put his head back on the rest , eyes closed against the brightness . He sat forward , and peered through the blazing space out the window . It was hard to see anything at all . " What ? " he said . <p> She leaned into the curve of the window as if to look under the reflected glare . " Something- " <p> " People are-leaving their cars , " he said . It was as though he had asked a question . <p> " No , look . A fight- " <p> Scuffling shapes moved across the blaze of sunlight , partly obscured by the cars in front . Something flashed , and there was a cracking sound . <p> " Michael ? " <p> " Hey , " he said , holding the wheel . <p> The scuffle came in a rush at them , at the front of the car-a man bleeding badly across the front of a white shirt . He seemed to glance off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he staggered toward them , and his shirt front came against the window on her side ; it seemed to agitate there for a few terrible seconds , and then it smeared downward , blotting everything out in bright red . She was screaming . She held her hands , with the magazine in them , to her face , and someone was hitting the windshield . There were more cracking sounds . Gunshots . She realized with a spasm of terror that they were gunshots . The door opened on his side , and she thought it was being opened from without . She was lying over on the seat now , in the roar and shout of the trouble , her arms over her head , and it took a moment for her to understand that she was alone . She was alone , and the trouble , whatever it was , had moved off . There were screams and more gunshots , the sound of many people running , horns and sirens . It was all in a distance , now . <p> " Michael , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The frenetic , busy notes of jazz were still coming from the radio , undisturbed and bright , under the sound of her cries . Someone was lifting her , someone 's hands were on her shoulders . She was surprised to find that she still clutched the magazine . She let it drop to the floor of the car , and looked up into a leathery , tanned , middle-aged face , small green eyes . <p> " Are you hit ? " the face said . <p> " I do n't know . What is it , what happened ? Where 's my husband ? " <p> " Can you sit up ? Can you get out of the car ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . " I think so . " <p> He helped her . There were many people standing on the curb , and in the open doors of stopped cars . She heard sirens . Somehow she had barked the skin of her knee . She stood out of the car , and the man supported her on his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some trouble here , " he said . " It 's all over . " <p> " Where 's my husband ? " She looked into the man 's face , and the face was blank . A second later , Michael stepped out of the glare beyond him and stood there , wringing his hands . She looked into his ashen face , and he seemed to want to look away . " Oh , Michael , " she said , reaching for him . <p> The policeman let her go . She put her arms around him and closed her eyes , feeling the solidness of his back , crying . " Michael . Oh . Michael , what happened ? " <p> " It 's okay , " he told her , loud over the sirens . " It 's over . " <p> She turned her head on his shoulder , and saw the knot of people working on the other side of the car . Her window was covered with blood . " Oh , God , " she said . " Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both , " the policeman said to them . <p> " My God , " Ivy said . " What happened here ? " <p> He had been thinking about flowers , and adultery . <p> One of the older men in the admissions office , Saul Dornby , had sent a dozen roses to his wife , and the wife had called , crying , to say that they had arrived . Michael took the call , because Dornby was out of the office , having lunch with one of the secretaries . Dornby was a man who had a long and complicated history with women , and people had generally assumed that he was having an affair with the secretary . He was always having affairs , and in the past few weeks he had put Michael in the position of fielding his wife 's phone calls . " I know it 's unpleasant for you , and I really do appreciate it . I 'll find some way to make it up to you . It would break Jenny 's heart to think I was having lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they are . It 's perfectly innocent this time , really . But it 's just better to keep it under wraps , you know , the past being what it is . After all , I met Jenny by playing around on someone else . You get my meaning ? I have n't been married four times for nothing . I mean , I have learned one or two things . " He paused and thought . " Man , I 'll tell you , Jenny was something in those first days I was with her . You know what I mean ? " Michael indicated that he knew . " Well , sure , son . You 're fresh married . Of course you know . Maybe that 's my trouble-I just need it to be fresh like that all the time . You think ? " <p> Dornby was also the sort of man who liked to parade his sense of superior experience before the young men around him . He behaved as though it were apparent that he was the envy of others . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistake of being initially in awe of him . But though Michael now resented the other man and was mostly bored by his talk , he had found that there was something alluring about the wife , had come to look forward to talking with her , hearing her soft , sad , melodious voice over the telephone . Something about possession of this intimate knowledge of her marriage made her all the more lovely to contemplate , and over the past few weeks he had been thinking about her in the nights . <p> Sitting behind the wheel with the sun in his eyes and his wife at his side paging through the magazine , he had slipped toward sleep , thinking about all this , thinking drowsily about the attraction he felt for Dornby 's wife , when something in the static calm around him began to change . Had his wife spoken to him ? <p> And then everything went terrifyingly awry . <p> He could n't say exactly when he had opened the door and dropped out of the car . The urge to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smearing down the window on his wife 's side . He had simply found himself out on the pavement , had felt the rough surface on his knees and the palms of his hands , and he had scrabbled between stopped cars and running people to the sidewalk . It had been just flight , trying to keep out of the line of fire , all reflex , and he had found himself clinging to a light pole , on his knees , while the shouts continued , and the crowd surged beyond him and on . He saw a man sitting in the doorway of a cafeteria , his face in his folded arms . There were men running in the opposite direction of the rushing crowd , and then he saw a man being subdued by several others , perhaps fifty feet away on the corner . He held on to the light pole , and realized he was crying , like a little boy . Several women were watching him from the entrance of another store , and he straightened , got to his feet , stepped uncertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was mostly quiet now . Though there were sirens coming from the distance , growing nearer . The gunshots had stopped ; and the screams . People had gathered near his car , and Ivy stepped out of the confusion there , saying his name . <p> He experienced a sudden rush of aversion . <p> There was something almost cartoonish about the pallor of her face , and he could n't bring himself to settle his eyes on her . As she walked into his arms , he took a breath and tried to keep from screaming , and then he heard himself telling her it was all right , it was over . <p> But of course it was n't over . <p> The police wanted statements from everyone , and the names and addresses . This was something that was going to go on , Michael knew . They were going to look at it from every angle , this traffic altercation that had ended in violence , and caused one man to be wounded in the abdomen and another to be shot in the hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " This one 's in the hip , " one of them said , and another answered , " Abdomen here . " It was difficult to tell who was involved and who was bystander . The traffic had backed up for blocks , and people were coming out of the buildings lining the street . <p> There was a slow interval of a kind of deep concentration , a stillness , while the police and the paramedics worked . The ambulances took the wounded men away , and a little while later the police cars began to pull out , too . The Blakelys sat in the back of one of the squad cars , while a polite officer asked them questions . The officer had questioned ten or eleven others , he told them-as though they had not been standing around waiting during this procedure-and now he explained in his quiet , considerate baritone voice that he needed everybody 's best recollection of the events . He hoped they understood . <p> " I do n't really know what was said , or what happened , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest idea , okay ? Like I said , we did n't know anything was happening until we heard the gunshots " <p> " We saw the scuffling " Ivy said . " Remember ? " <p> " I just need to get the sequence of events down , " the officer said . <p> " We saw the scuffle , " said Ivy . " Or I saw it . I was reading this magazine- " <p> " Look , it was a fight , " Michael broke in . " Have n't you got enough from all these other people ? We did n't know what was happening . " <p> " Well , sir-after you realized there was gunfire , what did you do ? " <p> Michael held back , glanced at his wife , and waited . <p> She seemed surprised for a second . " Oh . I-I got down on the front seat of the car . I had a magazine I was reading , and I put it up to my face , like-like this . " She pantomimed putting the magazine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " <p> " And you ? " the policeman said to Michael . <p> " I do n't even remember . " <p> " You got out of the car , " said his wife , in the tone of someone who had made a discovery . " You-you left me there . " <p> " I thought you were with me , " he said . <p> The policeman , a young man with deep-socketed eyes and a toothy white smile , closed his clipboard and said , " Well , you never know where anybody is at such a time , everything gets so confused . " <p> Ivy stared at her husband . " No , but you left me there . Where were you going , anyway ? " <p> " I thought you were with me , " he said . <p> " You did n't look back to see if I was ? " <p> He could n't answer her . <p> The policeman was staring at first one , and then the other , and seemed about to break out laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very considerate . " It 's a hard thing to know where everybody was when there 's trouble like this , or what anybody had in mind . " <p> Neither Michael nor his wife answered him . <p> " Well , " he went on . " I guess I 've got all I need . " <p> " Will anyone die ? " Ivy asked him . <p> He smiled . " I think they got things under control . " <p> " Then no one 's going to die . " <p> " I do n't think so . They got some help pretty quick , you knowMr . Vance , over there , is a doctor , and he stepped right in and started working on them . Small caliber pistols in both cases , thank God-looks like everybody 's gon na make it fine . " <p> Michael felt abruptly nauseous and dizzy . The officer was looking at him . <p> " Can you have someone wash the blood off our car ? " Ivy asked . <p> " Oh , Jesus , " Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a little green around the gills , sir . You could be in a little shock . Wait here . " He got out of the car , closed the door , and walked over to where a group of officers and a couple of paramedics were standing , on the other side of the street . In the foreground , another officer was directing traffic . Michael stared out at this man , and felt as though there was n't any breathable air . He searched for a way to open his window . His wife sat very still at his side , staring at her hands . <p> " Stop sighing like that , " she said suddenly . " You 're safe . " <p> " You heard the officer , " he told her . " I could be in shock . I ca n't breathe . " <p> " You 're panting . " <p> In the silence which followed , a kind of whimper escaped from the bottom of his throat . <p> " Oh , my God ; " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the officer coming back , and she noted the perfect crease of his uniform slacks . Her husband was a shade to her left , breathing . <p> " Ivy ? " he said . <p> The officer opened the door and leaned in . " Doctor 'll give you a look , " he said , across her , to Michael . <p> " I 'm okay , " Michael said . <p> " Well , " said the officer . " Ca n't hurt . " <p> They got out , and he made sure of their address . He said he had someone washing the blood from their car . Michael seemed to lean into him , and Ivy walked away from them , out into the street . The policeman there told her to wait . People were still crowding along the sidewalk on that side , and a woman sat on the curb , crying , being tended to by two others . The sun was still bright ; it shone in the dark hair of the crying woman . Ivy made her way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polite officer was helping Michael across . The two men moved to the knot of paramedics , and the doctor who had been the man of the hour took Michael by the arms and looked into his face . The doctor was rugged-looking , with thick , wiry brown hair , heavy , square features , and big , rough-looking hands-a man who did outdoor things , and was calm , in charge , perhaps five years older than Michael , though he seemed almost parental with him . He got Michael to sit down , then lie down , and he elevated his legs . Michael lay in the middle of the sidewalk , with a crate of oranges under his legs , which someone had brought from the deli , a few feet away . Ivy walked over there and waited with the others , hearing the muttered questions bystanders asked-was this one of the victims ? <p> The doctor knelt down and asked Michael how he felt . <p> " Silly , " Michael said . <p> " Well . You got excited . It 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up now ? " <p> " Think you can ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> The doctor helped him stand . A little smattering of approving sounds went through the crowd . Michael turned in a small circle , and located his wife . He looked directly at her , and then looked away . She saw this , and waited where she was . He was talking to the doctor , nodding . Then he came toward her , head down , like a little boy , she thought , a little boy ashamed of himself . <p> " Let 's go , " he said . <p> They walked down the street , to where the car had been moved . Someone had washed the blood from it , though she could still see traces of it in the aluminum trim along the door . She got in , and waited for him to make his way around to the driver 's side . When he got in , she arranged herself , smoothing her dress down , not looking at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . It was still slow going , three lanes moving fitfully toward the bridge . They were several blocks down the street before he spoke . <p> " Doctor said I had mild shock . " <p> " I saw . " <p> They reached the bridge , and then they were stopped there , with a view of the water , and the rest of the city ranged along the river 's edge-a massive , uneven shave of buildings with flame in every window , beyond the sparkle of the water . The sun seemed to be pouring into the car . <p> He reached over and turned the air conditioning off . " We 'll overheat , " he said . <p> " Can you leave it on a minute ? " she asked . <p> He rolled his window down . " We 'll overheat . " <p> She reached over and put it on , then leaned into it . The air was cool , blowing on her face , and she closed her eyes . She had chosen too easily , when she chose him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it arrived ; she gave in to it , accepted it , with a small bitter rush of elation and anger . The flow of cool air on her face stopped . He had turned it off . <p> " I just thought I 'd run it for a minute , " she said . <p> He turned it on again . She leaned forward , took a breath , then turned it off . " That 's good . " She imagined herself going on with her life , making other choices ; she was relieved to be alive , and she felt exhilarated . The verv air seemed sweeter . She saw herself alone , or with someone else , some friend to whom she might tell the funny story of her young husband running off and leaving her to her fate in the middle of a gun battle . <p> But in the next instant , the horror of it reached through her , and made her shudder , deep . " God , " she murmured . <p> He said nothing . The traffic moved a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idled forward , then accelerated slowly . <p> " Mind the radio ? " she said . <p> He thought she seemed slightly different with him now , almost superior . He remembered how it felt to be lying in the middle of the sidewalk with the orange crate under his legs . When he spoke , he tried to seem neutral . " Pardon me ? " <p> " I asked if you mind the radio . " <p> " Up to you , " he said . <p> " Well , what do you want ? " <p> " Radio 's fine . " <p> She turned it on . She could n't help the feeling that this was toying with him , a kind of needling . Yet it was a pleasant feeling . The news was on ; they listened for a time . <p> It 's too early , I guess , " she said . <p> " Too early for what ? " <p> " I thought it might be on the news . " She waited a moment . The traffic was moving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and sat there with the air fanning her face , eyes closed . She felt him watching her , and she had begun to feel guilty-even cruel . They had , after all , both been frightened out of their wits . He was her husband , whom she loved . " Let me know if you think I ought to turn it off again . " <p> " I said we 'd overheat , " he said . <p> She only glanced at him . " We 're moving now . It 's okay if we 're moving , right ? " Then she closed her eyes and faced into the cool rush of air . <p> He looked at her , sitting there with her eyes closed , basking in the coolness as if nothing at all had happened . He wanted to tell her about Saul Dornby 's wife . He tried to frame the words into a sentence that might make her wonder what his part in all that might be-but the thing sounded foolish to him : Saul , at work , makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on her . I 've been going to sleep at night dreaming about what it might be like if I got to know her a little better . <p> " If it 's going to cause us to overheat , I 'll turn it off , " she said . <p> He said nothing . <p> Well , he could pout if he wanted to . He was the one who had run away and left her to whatever might happen . She thought again how it was that someone might have shot into the car while she cringed there , alone . " Do you want me to turn it off ? " she said . <p> " Leave it be , " he told her . <p> They were quiet , then , all the way home . She gazed out the front , at the white lines coming at them and at them . He drove slowly , and tried to think of something to say to her , something to explain everything in some plausible way . <p> She noticed that there was still some blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seeped down between the door and the glass . When he pulled into the drive in front of the house , she waited for him to get out , then slid across the seat and got out behind him . <p> " They did n't get all the blood , " she said . <p> " Jesus . " He went up the walk toward the front door . <p> " I 'm not going to clean it , " she said . <p> " I 'll take it to the car wash : ' <p> He had some trouble with the key to the door . He cursed under his breath , and finally got it to work . They walked through the living room to their bedroom , where she got out of her clothes , and was startled to find that some blood had gotten on the arm of her blouse . <p> " Look at this , " she said . She held it out for him to see . <p> " I see . " <p> The expression on her face , that cocky little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed the urge , and went about changing his own clothes . He was appalled at the depth of his anger . " Can you believe it ? " she said . <p> " Please , " he said . " I 'd like to forget the whole thing . " <p> " I know , but look . " <p> " I see it . What do you want me to do with it ? " <p> " Okay , " she said . " I just thought it was something-that it got inside the window somehow . It got on my arm . " <p> " Get it out of her , " ' he said . " Put it away . " <p> She went into the bathroom and threw the blouse into the trash . Then she washed her face and hands , and got out of her skirt , her stockings . " I 'm going to take a shower , " she called to him . He did n't answer , so she went to the entrance of the living room , where she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . <p> " Is what on ? " <p> " Okay . I 'm going to take a shower . " <p> " Ivy ; ' he said . <p> She waited . She kept her face as impassive as possible . <p> " I 'm really sorry . I did think you were with me , that we were running together , you know . " <p> It occurred to her that if she allowed him to , he would turn this into the way he remembered things , and he would come to believe it was so . She could give this to him , simply by accepting his explanation of it all . In the same instant something hot rose up in her heart , and she said , " But you did n't look back to see where I was . " She said this evenly , almost cheerfully . <p> " Because I thought you were there . Right behind me . Do n't you see ? " <p> The pain in his voice was oddly far from making her feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . And you would n't have known it . " <p> He said nothing . He had the thought that this would be something she might hold over him , and for an instant he felt the anger again , wanted to make some motion toward her , something to shake her , as he had been shaken . " Look , " he said . <p> She smiled . " What ? " <p> " Everything happened so fast . " <p> " You looked so funny , lying on the sidewalk with that crate of oranges under your legs . You know what it said on the side ? ' Fresh from Sunny Florida . ' Think of it . I mean nobody got killed , so it 's funny . Right ? " <p> " Jesus Christ , " he said . <p> " Michael . It 's over . We 're safe . We 'll laugh about it eventually , you 'll see . " <p> And there was nothing he could say . He sat down and stared at the television , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , Kansas . She walked over and kissed him on the top of his head . <p> " Silly , " she said . <p> He turned to watch her go back down the hall , and a moment later he could hear the shower running . He turned the television off , and made his way back to the entrance of the bathroom . The door was ajar . Peering in , he saw the vague shape of her through the light curtain . He stood there , one hand gripping the door , the rage working in him . He watched the shape move . <p> She was thinking that it was not she who had run away ; that there was no reason for him to be angry with her , or disappointed in her .
