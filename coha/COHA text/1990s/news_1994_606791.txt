<p> Tim Allen is Al Bundy in clean socks , a guy 's guy who on special occasions remembers to put the toilet seat down . The star of TV 's top-rated " Home Improvement " and author of the best-selling " Do n't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man , " Allen is playing the ultimate patriarch in " The Santa Clause , " an adorable yuletide comedy about a neglectful dad who becomes Father Christmas . <p> So it 's no longer " heh-heh-heh " for the Tool Man , but a heartfelt " ho ho ho ... and a Merry Christmas to you all . " Still , it 's not that much of a stretch between " Home Improvement 's " affable hardware maven and the jolly old elf himself . They both have workshops behind the house , and they both love tinkering with engines . And well , to be honest , Santa also has a terrible problem with flatulence . <p> Lactose intolerance ? No , just a male enthusiasm . <p> His interest in flatulence , explains Allen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fast cars , loud noises , power tools , naked women . His show , his book , his stand-up act all celebrate " masculinism . " But not , he insists , at the expense of feminism . He has , he 'll tell you , dedicated his life to pleasing women , especially wife Laura and daughter Kady , 4 . Allen , 41 , really is n't a cave man , he just plays one on TV . From the neck up , he even looks almost bookish in tortoise-shell spectacles . And he 's wearing makeup  --  for an upcoming TV interview . It 's an experience that will probably find its way into his material , which invariably deals with the differences between the sexes . <p> It 's a topic that comes up with less frequency in " The Santa Clause , " but it comes up just the same . Allen plays a recently divorced man who has trouble getting along with his ex-wife 's pompous psychiatrist husband . But in the end , the whole darn family hang their stockings by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for Tim Allen . What dances in his head is a vision of a pretty girl  --  a long-ago Playboy December playmate  --  dangling mistletoe before a crackling fire . It was his sexual awakening . " She had no top on ! It was so ... so ... " Words momentarily escape the nostalgic middle-ager . <p> " She was so warm and friendly too . She had on those bedroom slippers with the fluff on them and ' amples , ' we called them , underwear that covered her bellybutton , like my grandma wears now . And she 's somehow in the middle of the living room on Christmas Eve looking at these little boys going , ' It 's okay , go ahead and look . I 'm just putting up mistletoe . ' " <p> It was the best thing that had happened to him since he stopped believing in Santa Claus . " It 's when you first realize that there 's a lot more to life than exploding stuff , and a lot more of it has to do with women than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this plateau ever since . <p> As the star of " Home Improvement , " he is nevertheless the guru of 41 million red-blooded American couch potatoes who tune in weekly to see Tim " The Tool Man " Taylor hammer out domestic harmony with his sassy wife , played by Patricia Robertson . Allen further explores gender issues in his book . And though he uses most of its 210 pages to advance his " masculinist " philosophy , he also deals with such issues as bloating and butt size in a chapter called " Women Are People , Too . " <p> His interests notwithstanding , Santa has no love interest in the movie . And had Santa encountered that topless playmate on Christmas Eve , Allen says , " He would have looked away and said , ' I am very , very sorry . I 'll come back at a different time . ' I think this guy is , if it 's possible , beyond sex . He 's not celibate . He 's just got sooo much to do . " <p> A Cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Saint Nicholas in " Ernest Saves Christmas " and now Allen 's character in " The Santa Clause " all get into trouble with the law simply because nobody believes in them . That is , except for the big saps and little children in the audience who begin to sniffle and wail , respectively , when the cops lock Santa in the slammer . In the scene , Allen collapses onto the hard bunk with the weariness of one who 's been there , done that . <p> " To be perfectly blunt , I am an ex-con . I 'm a felon , " acknowledges Allen , who served a 30-month sentence after he was convicted of selling cocaine as a college student in 1979 . Why did he do it ? " Forty grand a month . What would n't you do for that in college ? " he says defensively . " Back then cocaine was a very , very yuppie drug . At $ 150 for a gram of it , you had to be very wealthy to own this stuff . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad , but it 's like the CIA in those old spy movies  --  it 's real easy to get into and it 's really hard to get out . " <p> Prison was miserable , he says , but his sense of humor seems to have pulled him through . " This one guy hated being there , hated being a loser and resented me for having a college education . This guy  --  God , he could kill me if he wanted . He had a lot of scars and those bad prison tattoos you do with ink and a pin . He had ' expletive you ' tattooed on his eyelids . He shut his eyes and it was , ' expletive you . ' I said , ' That 's cool . ' <p> " He said , ' Yeah , it 's for the parole board . ' <p> " I said , ' You 'll make an impression that way . ' <p> " He goes , ' What do you mean by that ? You think that college expletive makes you something special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cwose to cwosing time , Mr. Wabbitt . ' And he cracked up . It worked every time . " <p> Allen writes about his experiences behind bars in " Do n't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man , " but he was never successful at incorporating the material into his act . Nobody laughed . They thought he was making the whole thing up . Naughty but nice , they 'd buy , but not a clean-cut Midwesterner cracking " do n't drop the soap " jokes . So he built his act around the notion that men are pigs . And that 's how he brought home the bacon through the end of the ' 80s . <p> Then one night he got a call from Disney . <p> " Honey , it 's Jerry Klatzenferger , " whispered his wife , Laura . <p> In fact , Jeffrey Katzenberg and some of the other Mouseketeers had seen Allen 's act on tape and wanted to deal . Since the conversation , Disney has practically turned Allen into a franchise . In addition to producing " Home Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Disney bankrolled " The Santa Clause , " and its book division published " Never Stand Too Close to a Naked Man . " What 's left  --  Timland ? <p> The company is not ungrateful . Disney Chairman Joe Roth sent the champagne that 's chilling on the end table , and Allen 's suite at the Four Seasons is funereal with gargantuan bowls of lilies . All this for a guy who grunts ? <p> He 's sipping the ubiquitous Evian water , smoking the ubiquitous butt . There 's a little spare tire creeping over his black Gap jeans . <p> So did he gain all that weight for the role ? <p> No , he slipped into an 85-pound fat suit . Cranberry velvet , and hot as hell . <p> " The suit is attached right to my eyelids , " he says . " The only thing that 's me is my eyes . The big nose , the ears , the jowls , the forehead are glued-on fakes . It 's a good thing I 'm new at the job . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot the movie in Iceland and leave him in a shack for three weeks while he got into the character . " <p> On Men and Women <p> Timothy Allen Dick grew up in Denver , and might have had a more normal childhood if he 'd been born with a different surname . " Every class , every new guy I met , every place we went , it was a new group of people laughing at the same stupid joke . " <p> He naturally became the guy he is today . And while tools , sports , cars and flatulence jokes remain a few of his favorite things , he is edging into more sophisticated terrain on " Home Improvement . " <p> " We 've had three episodes this year and probably five last year that really highlight problematic differences between the sexes . It gets hot on the set when we do those . The staff , which is pretty equally mixed  --  if not in size , in spirit  --  between very strong women and very strong men , get into it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about what men say about women when they 're not around , and I 'd been videotaped at the hardware store talking to a bunch of guys about how boring it is when I go to one of my wife 's functions . They said , ' You think your wife 's boring ? Well , my wife is the Big Bopper of Boredom . ' We 're just actually talking to each other  --  we do n't really mean what we said . Men do it on the golf course , they do it in men 's clubs , Milton Berle 's always done it . <p> " And Pat his costar said , ' If you were fully evolved , you would not have to do that . ' It was in the middle of the writer 's meeting , and we all laughed . She says the men that she knows do n't have to do this stuff . And I said , ' I think that 's bull . They get by themselves , that 's what men do . Women , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' You are rude , I 'm not rude . I 'm so sensitive , if I have something bad to say about you , I say it in front of strangers in a strange place . ' " <p> Allen seems genuinely perplexed by this curious aspect of female behavior . " All men are bewildered by the other sex , " he says . " Like why do women ask , ' What were you thinking ? ' Every guy has heard that . Women ca n't understand that we were n't . We were n't thinking . It 's very easy for men to slip into this non-thinking mode . We 're not asleep , we 're not unconscious , we 're just not thinking . Women are always thinking about the feelings of others generally . It 's not that men do n't care about other people 's feelings . I 'm not sure where we are at that point . Maybe we 're just self-centered . " <p> Or something . <p> For all his macho buffoonery , Allen is about as astute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most conclude that the sexes are from different planets , but Allen thinks men and women are more like different species . We may breed , but we 're happier with our own kind . <p> Still , he insists that " everything men do is for the appreciation of women . Another car , whatever . Basically our whole lives are dedicated to figuring out how we will get women to like us so that they will let us have sex with them . It 's all about finding a strong woman and procreating . It 's all about having babies . " <p> The danger , of course , is they 'll all turn out to be girls .
