Paul Burkholder always had firecrackers , and sitting on my back porch again he kept lighting inchers , one after another , holding then tossing each over the railing where they exploded , the shreds of blue-and-red paper settling on the shiny green leaves of pachysandra . Jimmy Sterzic was there , too , as always , chewing squares of bubble gum and reading the Bazooka Joe comics and laughing like a nut . <p> My father was n't crazy about us hanging around all day but there was nothing else to do , which was exactly what I said to him one afternoon in July when he got tome from work at the plant , like he was somehow to blame for our boredom , and he said back , slowly and sounding exhausted , " You 'll all three end up in the service someday and it 'll be the best thing ever happened . Someday , and they 'll straighten you out good . " <p> But we were n't scared of going , not at fourteen we were n't , and when my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Burkholder said quietly , " I 'd enlist in a minute if they 'd let me . The Army 'd be cool . Artillery or demolition . Shit , just blow stuff up all day . " <p> Jimmy , taking the pink wad of gum out of his mouth , lobbed it hand-grenade style over the unmown lawn , and when it hit , he said , kind of in slow motion , " Kaaaboooom . " <p> My father had told me once how he lied about his age so he could go fight in Europe during WW II . But there was no war now and we were n't going anywhere , not without a driver 's license or a set of wheels . Paul was just talking big and I said to him , " You 'd hate taking orders , you 'd hate it . " <p> " No worse than rotting here , " Paul said , " in East Bumfuck , Egypt , " and Jimmy chimed in , " You got that right , " and he reached for one of Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray floorboards . Paul stole four , sometimes five packs a week from his mother 's cartons in their pantry . We all knew she drank like a fish and , as Paul would say when he was mad at her , she smoked like a chimney , too . Booze and tobacco . Paul said one time that she was worse than a reservation Indian , but he got real sad when he said that and , I guess to make a joke out of it , he said , " Watch this , " and he put the lit end of his cigarette into his mouth and closed his lips and bellowed his cheeks , blowing the smoke out backwards . Then he put a finger in each ear and opened his eyes wide and blew some more until his face turned beet red and he fell to the ground , pretending to pass out . " That 's my old lady , " he said , spitting out the cigarette . " A drunken Indian smokestack . " <p> Paul never burned himself doing stunts like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand were stained with nicotine . He smoked in the boys ' room at school and on the back of the bus , cupping his cigarette behind the seat in front of him and exhaling out the half-opened window . <p> But it was n't a cigarette he put between his lips this afternoon  --  it was an incher and I did n't like him fooling around like that and I said so . <p> " Come on , how much ? " he asked . " Put your money where your mouth is . " <p> " Your mouth , " I said . <p> " Five bucks ! " Jimmy said . " Five big ones if you light it , " and he took a long drag and flicked the ash on the stairs and handed Paul the cancer stick . <p> I shook my head and said , " You 'll look great without a face , " remembering how he 'd bitten down hard on a ladyfinger one night and lit it and how , when it went off , it sounded dull and small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gums so he could n't hardly eat for almost a week . An incher had ten times the wallop , so I figured he 'd never really do it , but he did , touching the fuse alive and closing his eyes . I yelled , " Spit it out , Jesus God , " and jumped off the stairs , Jimmy right behind me and ducking to one side . <p> When the sparks died , Jimmy straightened and took one step forward and said , " Holy shitburger , a goddamned dud , " but we moved no closer , not until Paul opened his eyes and I eased the incher out and dropped it quick and ground it back and forth under my sneaker . I said , " You 're mental , you know that ? " and all he said was , " Yeah , I know , " and all that evening , feeding small sticks to a campfire in the backyard , we discussed how he 'd beaten the odds , fifty , maybe seventy-five to one . <p> " You bet your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk ourselves to something big , something we 'll be remembered by . " <p> " Such as ? " Jimmy asked , and Paul said , still staring into the flames , " Such as snuffing out this hick shit town . " He blew three perfect smoke rings above the fire . <p> " You got a bomb now , I suppose ? " Jimmy said . " or a mortar launcher ? " and he laughed until Paul looked up at him and then over at me and he said , " No , with our thumbnails . We 'll obliterate this whole place with no more than our thumbnails , " and he stood and reached his fist above his head , his thumb sticking up , and he covered up the full moon , and then Venus and then all of Orion 's Belt . " All you need is distance . Try it , " he said , and we did , the three of us standing close together and saying nothing , ready this time to leave our mark on the world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't know anyone who had , though the town 's old population , 5,442 , was painted in huge white letters across all that green . But since the copper mines had failed , maybe there were half that many people and most everyone was out of work . Paul said he bet those numbers were at least fifteen feet high and Jimmy said , " Horseshit , " and then a second time when I swore I could see the tower swaying just a fraction against the blue sky . " In a strong wind it might , sure , " Paul said , but it was real still that morning where we were standing , me and Paul craning our necks and shading our eyes while Jimmy recoiled the rope and threw it up again and this time the heavy knot on the end went through the first ladder rung far enough for me to jump up and grab it and pull it down . Then Jimmy , working from his knees , tied a slip noose and snugged up the slack and tested the rope by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be my guest , " he said , and I spit on my palms and started up , hand over hand , just like I 'd done in gym one day , a few girls whispering and watching me from the fold-out bleachers . I made it all the way to the ceiling , the only one to ever have touched it , according to Mr. Nykerk who 'd taught Phys . Ed. in Ludlow for nineteen years . I remember how I never once peeked down and how I had yelled , suspended between those steel rafters , for someone to drag the mats away so it would seem more dangerous . I could hear Mr. Nykerk say , " No , " to the other boys . " No , " he said , and later Paul told me how Mr. Nykerk had motioned them all to move away and how he piled mats on top of one another , the whole time staring up like he expected me to jump . " Dumb , " was all he said to me when I got down , " dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , sitting with my father at a parent-teacher conference , Mr. Nykerk referred to me as a regular Jack-and-the-Beanstalk . " Nonsense , " my father had said , " my boy 's scared to death of heights , " but I said no , I was n't anymore , that I 'd conquered that fear , and I nodded at him lots of times and Mr. Nykerk did , too , my father looking back and forth between us , saying finally that it was smarter to turn away from what frightened us . Like he had at sixteen , walking out of a mine shaft his first day down . " Chickenshit , " some of the guys had called at him , " asshole , " but they were n't saying anything now , he said , those who stayed to raise their kids on welfare checks or , like Paul 's dad , had driven away alone late one night and never returned . " Fear is where you do n't belong , " my father had lectured , but I was climbing again , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole-in-the-wall factory that made sun visors for GM . Like Paul had said the night before , we needed distance , and no place loomed higher than the water tower , and if I got scared halfway up I was n't turning around . I carried a jackknife in the back pocket of my dungarees , and I 'd at least scratch my initials on top , and the year , 1959 . Beyond that , there was n't a plan , not yet , or a way of seeing much beyond my fingers which squeezed the first iron rung and then the next and the next , Paul end Jimmy screaming for me to slow down . <p> Sweating pretty bad , I wondered if there really was water up there and a way to dive inside and if the wafer was real cold inside all that steel , cold like an ocean . I imagined the three of us swimming naked some muggy night then , side by side , hitching our elbows over the edge of the tower and sharing an old Gold and watching the lights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought how we really could obliterate this hick town with our thumbnails  --  my factory father who always played it safe and gave out too much advice , and Paul 's drunken mother and Jimmy 's oldest sister who we knew rejected her family and whored around in the bars , not that she was wrong exactly , but all those people we loved made us awful edgy doing what they did with their lives . So , no matter the danger , we 'd rise above them , literally . <p> " Move it , " I yelled down to Paul and Jimmy , and suddenly the half summer we had left felt like too little time , and I started climbing again , my heart pounding and pounding in a way that had nothing to do with heights . <p> The three of us sat with our backs against the tower , right under the huge white numbers . A pretty stiff breeze blew out of the north behind us , end Jimmy , looking pale , said , " Damn if this thing ai n't moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread his fingers wide and placed his palms carefully on the floor of the catwalk as if for balance and he would n't move them , not even when Paul offered him a smoke . " Take one , " Paul said , " come on , " but Jimmy just shook his head no and straightened his spine and pressed his head back and dosed his eyes . <p> " Christ , " he said , " we 're so goddamn high , " and I thought for a minute that he might panic , but he did n't , and when I got up to circle counterclockwise around the tower , he said , " Mother of God . " He said , " Dougie , be fucking careful , " and he flinched when I stepped by him and said , " Hey , we 're on a roll , remember ? We 're just raising the stakes a little . It 's duck soup . We ca n't lose . " <p> " Yes we can , " he said . " Me and Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roll , Dougie . That incher was n't really a dud . " <p> Paul took a long , deep drag on his cigarette and shrugged at me like , What the hell , we 're here , right ? , and we 're not bored out of our skulls for once , but he seemed awful nervous , too , as he flicked his butt away from his lips , flicked it way out and we both watched it , not so much dropping as floating sideways , as though on the surface of a perfectly clear river , a few giant boulders on the bottom glaring up from over a hundred feet below . <p> From the back side of the tower I could see the town dump , the thin smoke rising , and I could hear the blunt barking of Roy Magoon 's Airedale and the intermittent pop of a .22 , and I wished right then that I had my father 's spotting scope so I could make out who it was shooting . Probably Roy himself who rarely left and always scrunched up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could hunt the rats , too . He 'd let you , no problem , but he just liked to be asked . Most guys who came , came just before dark , some with handguns , like Jimmy 's dad , and some after dark , their engines idling , and they 'd sit on the hoods of their cars or pickups , drinking quarts of beer and taking aim down the steady beam of headlights . <p> My father called it " killing time , " meaning it both ways , like it was time to kill and also that it passed the dead hours when there was nothing else for folks to do . He did n't want me going there and I did n't go much , except to drive over with him each Saturday morning to dump our garbage . He 'd back up the station wagon and I 'd get out and open the rear door and heave the bags over the edge onto the main pile . Sometimes I 'd kind of whip the bags so they broke open , the contents spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , would n't say anything , saving the silence , I guess , so that when he did speak it was supposed to carry more clout . But it didn't. on the way out he 'd say the same thing every time he saw Roy Magoon asleep on a battered recliner in the dump shack . He 'd say , " Some existence , " and I 'd nod , pretending to agree , but I figured Roy was as natural to the symmetry of this county as anyone else who chose to stay and wait things out , scavenging to stay alive if that 's what it took until times changed . <p> Which they never did , so the population decreased every year . People dying or leaving and nobody new coming in , except for the Sellgrins . I never knew why they moved up here . What I did know was that Phyllis Sellgrin was the most seductive girl I 'd ever seen , a tenth grader who gave me this godawful feeling in my stomach whenever she 'd pass me in the halls , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day holding a cherry bomb between his thumb and finger , said it reminded him of a giant nipple . " Like Phyllis Sellgrin 's nipples , " he said and I said back , " Keep dreaming , " and we both laughed and traded punches on the arm , shoving each other as we ran , bent over , away from the half-filled can of paint which exploded behind us . We walked back to check the damage , and Paul , starting one of our standard jokes , said , " How they hanging ? " and I said , " Same as always  --  round and firm and full of sperm . " <p> " Ditto , " he said and we pointed out to each other how the undersides of the maple leaves had turned sticky red and dripping almost twenty feet up . <p> " Some nipple , " I said . <p> " Yeah , " Paul said , " I 'd sure as hell think twice about sticking that one in my mouth . " <p> But I would n't have , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were about the odds of me ever getting closer to her than fantasy . But I liked even that much up here with the fat clouds passing and the breeze on my face and the sound of a semi gearing down for the junction of 28 and 41 , probably heading east to Marquette or Escanaba . I wondered , if at night , I could solve the puzzle of streets and houses , and if , through the scope , I could glimpse Phyllis crossing her bedroom , maybe in just a white slip , or see her pause , staring out the window at the stars before pulling the shade and killing the lights . <p> This was the place to be , okay , an outpost , and if Paul and Jimmy could get their minds off falling I believed we 'd all be saved . And I almost wished my father was below me so I could hang right over and shout down to him that I was n't afraid , that I 'd beaten that fear just like I said . It was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't die . Not like Jimmy who was terrified and who , right that minute , was calling me . " Dougie . " And then his voice higher pitched , " Dougie , " and then Paul 's voice , too , " Come on , Dougie , do n't fuck around , " and I kicked off one of my sneakers , then the other one , and watched them for almost a full minute tumble end over end and when they hit the ground they bounced , who knows how far , in opposite directions , and I yelled back to those guys , " okay , let 's get down , " which we all did , safe and sound , and we peddled our bikes hard to my backyard and leaned them against the side of the house where they stayed all afternoon while we talked and smoked until my father came home and stepped slowly between us up the stairs , pausing and saying nothing and touching my head in a way he had n't done for months . Then he turned and bummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and poured himself a cup of muddy coffee from his thermos , but he did n't drink more than a sip . " Terrible , " he said , and emptied the rest onto the lawn . He make-believe shivered to show his distaste , but it was Friday and very warm still and I knew he 'd sweat doing a little yard work , maybe spading under the honeysuckle , and after that he 'd turn on the sprinkler and have a slow beer and take a shower and get ready to watch the fights on TV . " Club fighters , has-beens , " he 'd say without fail , " every last one of them punch-drunk . " But he 'd be right there watching every round , bobbing and weaving on the edge of the couch as though he were the one getting clobbered . Sometimes he 'd shout instructions : " Get out of there , stay the hell away , " like the only intelligent strategy was to run for ten rounds , even if you lost and got booed . At least you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marciano or Dempsey could have licked the whole bunch on the same night , " he 'd say . " or Jake LaMotta . " But he was n't talking boxing just then , though he did hit me on the cheek with a light , open-handed left , and I covered up , my fists in front of my face , and Paul and Jimmy , they kind of laughed , my father winking at them before he stood up and walked away , his thermos under his arm , the same black lunch pail he 'd carried for years and years swinging at his side . <p> " Stay down , you bum , " my father kept yelling to the white guy who 'd hit the canvas for a second time . " Stay down , for Christsake . " The crowd at ringside was on its feet , the referee counting , " Seven , eight , nine , " and I closed the front door quietly behind me . <p> Paul was waiting at the end of the driveway , the tip of his cigarette glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , taking a few steps forward , and he handed me a single Roman candle , the last one he had left . <p> " I 'll watch from the river , " he said , and I said , " okay , good , " and I checked to see if I had the new book of matches , which I did , in the Army knapsack , along with my father 's scope and a single bottle of beer and an opener . <p> " Do n't drink that up there , " he said . " I 'm telling you , drunks have shitty balance . Check out my mother 's eye , " he said , " from her last fall . " <p> In the distance we both watched a flash of heat lightning , which Paul mistook for a storm heading our way . <p> " Nonsense , " I said . " Look at the stars , " and he held up his thumbnail in front of his one open eye and said , " What stars ? " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he said , without any hesitation , " Forget it , once is plenty for me . " <p> Jimmy wanted no part of this either , and he 'd gone to the dump with his dad instead , and his dad 's friend , a guy named Webster Crockett . People called him Davey because he shot so good , but he 'd had a seizure at the dump one night and scared hell out of everyone , squeezing his pistol so hard nobody could pry it loose from his hand . An ambulance arrived finally from Nagaunee , and Jimmy , who was there the whole time , said he 'd never seen anything so eerie , that white ambulance and the red light flashing across all that garbage and across Webster 's contorted face and nobody shooting rats except for Roy Magoon who kept saying , " Let him lay a while , he 'll be fine . Just give him some air goddammit . " And Webster was fine after that , if he 'd take his medication , but still he always made Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to him , but anything was preferable to the water tower , even if it meant sighting down a gun barrel right next to Webster Crockett , who 'd tell you , " Squeeze the trigger , " to whoever was shooting next to him and flinching . " Squeeze , " he 'd say , " like you love ' er , like this , " and he 'd take careful aim , his hand perfectly steady , and when a rat crawled into range , he 'd pop it every time . <p> So I was going it alone . I caught a glimpse of Paul 's face in the headlights of a passing car , and his face looked like a death mask , white and pasty , which spooked me , and I said , " What the hell you doing ? " and he said , " What ? I 'm not doing anything . " But he was , acting scared , abandoning the one real chance we had to steal this night , soar above this crippled town . <p> I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no action , and that the world really would be different up there if he 'd only relax , and that even one slow orbit around the tower might change his life , the way mountain climbers said it did them , reaching the summit of Mt . McKinley or Mt . Everest , then just sitting and staring out at night . But feeling lonely , too , I figured , which was all part of it , renewing , momentarily , an interest in death . Which is the reverse of what my father said . " Keep clear of it , " he said . " Mr. Death arrives on his own soon enough . " <p> " Ask the rats , " I said to Paul , who said , " The rats ? What rats ? " and he shook his head and said , " You 're loony sometimes , " and he got on his bike and glided across the road , then back to my side farther down , his generator light glowing redder and redder the faster he peddled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure he flipped me the bird , the way he would at his own house some nights , having argued with his mother who , at those times , he said he hated . <p> " You do n't hate her , not really , " I 'd se ' end he 'd answer every time , " You do n't know , Dougie , not about this subject , you do n't , " which maybe was true , and I thought about my mother who 'd been dead almost ten years and how Paul could be a king cork saying the things he did , calling his mother a drunken Indian smokestack in front of us , dumb stuff like that . My father said booze was poison to all Indians , even if they were only a quarter blood , like Mrs. Burkholder , whose grandfather was Ottawa , a chief , Paul told people , but no one except me ever really believed him . <p> Earlier in the summer he 'd stolen a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon from home , and me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat rocks under the bridge , telling jokes and toasting the cars that passed , the tires slapping above us over the loose boards . Paul got the most looped , so maybe that part of the Indian still was in him . Jimmy was feeling pretty good , too , though , and he stood up and smashed his empties , one right after the other , against the abutment on the far side of the river and he laughed and reached then for Paul 's empties and Paul said , " Hey , back off . " He looked at both of us like he was mad , but he smiled right way and pressed the bottle caps back on with the heel of his hand and tossed the two bottles underhanded a little ways up the river . They bobbed , then tipped sideways . Paul had already tied a rock to an M-80 which he lit and we watched it sink for a few seconds before we ducked back and covered up , the waterproof fuse spitting pink and white . When it exploded , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million brown slivers around us . " Yeah , " Paul had shouted . " Yeah , yeah , yeah , " his war cry against boredom , and Jimmy , all crazy now , too , yelled , " More firewater , more goddamn firewater for us savages , " and he whooped and whooped but I said nothing , all wet now and still nursing my second beer and watching a few big suckers float belly-up in front of me , their tails twitching as they tried to right themselves , the slow current carrying them into the moonlight . <p> Always something dying in this town for fun , and that 's what I kept thinking as I climbed the , water tower , about that and suicide , which Paul said earlier was the only reason anyone fell in love with heights . " You go up there and like it , " he said , " then part of you wants to jump . " <p> " Or fly , " I whispered to myself , and I could hear the rumble of thunder way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and the temperature dropping , the way it does sometimes right before a downpour . But I felt only a few hard drops on my face and then nothing , the sky clear to the east above the town , and I do n't know why , but I thought , This is where I 'd like to be when the first real snows blow in , turning everything white and still and silent  --  the sounds of those .22s behind me , and Roy 's dog barking , and what must have been a whole pack of inchers popping , a signal from Paul to let me know he was there at the river like he said he 'd be , waiting . <p> I sat down and let the knapsack slide from my shoulders , and I dangled my feet over the edge of the catwalk and held onto the guard rail , first with both hands , then with just one , and then slowly , I eased that hand away , too , and cupped them both around my mouth and shouted , " Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I yelled , " Phyllis Sellgrin , you have a beautiful bod and I love you . I LOVE YOU . " And I yelled to my father , " Look , no hands , " and I held them in front of myface , palms inward , and I thought , Hands , and I remembered the only thing I ever remembered about my mother , how she cooled me down with rubbling alcohol that time when I got very sick , that time right before she died . So I called to her , too : " Mother , where are you ? " and I started to cry when the clouds covered the moon , and I leaned forward and looked straight down into all that dark and said to myself , " Shin , shin , that 's enough , " and I got out the beer and opened it and took a long swig , followed by a second , and a third , and put the bottle down half-empty beside me . <p> I closed my eyes for what seemed a long time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses had gone out . But not in ours . I knew my father was asleep on the couch . I could n't make him out , not even with the scope cranked up to the highest power , but I used our house as a point of reference to find Paul 's , and I could see clearly two people in the kitchen kissing across the table . I could not make out the man . Maybe it was Paul 's dad come back after all these years , but probably not . More likely it was a boyfriend passing through . Mrs. Burkholder was a very pretty woman . Even my father , who said some cruddy things sometimes about the Indians , said she was really something before all the booze , a true knockout . <p> I thought the man was going to touch her more than he did . But she was the one pulling him close , kissing him hard on the lips and for a long time before she let go of him and sat back in her chair . She did n't walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on , and then , after a couple minutes , the headlights , and I watched the car drive out of town , winding right past where Paul would be sitting alone , and I wanted at that moment for him to know that he was the best friend I ever had or ever would and that we 'd stick together no matter what , even if it meant going into the Army . <p> " Paul , Paul Burkholder , " I shouted , though I knew he could not hear me . " This one 's no dud and it 's for you , buddy , " and I wedged the Roman candle into the wire mesh of the catwalk , the nose pointing upward , and I ignited the fuse and stood up and moved a few feet away . The rocket exploded into a red canopy of stars and , like a flare , lighted the whole tower , enough so I could see to climb onto the guard rail and stretch out my arms wide enough to hug this town we all claimed we hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'd tell Paul , and Jimmy , too . I 'd say , " Listen up , you guys . " I 'd say , " Listen , there are people in this town who will always make us sad . " And maybe we 'd get talking about how we probably would stay here for a while , smoking our parents ' cigarettes and drinking their beer , which was n't all that wrong . And anyway , it was fun some nights when we were together , we all had to admit that , getting tipsy and laughing to beat hell and keeping our lives in balance . <p> <p> By Jack Driscoll <p>
