<p> NEW YORK Like me , you may find it hard to swallow an aspirin . But if you 've got a headache , what other choice do you have ? <p> Some pros relate that to the state of the market . Worrywarts are everywhere . Ritzy stock prices and uncertainty as to how President Clinton 's economic package will fare in Congress are scary . And some pros see stocks getting whacked . Yet the lack of stock alternatives ( given falling rates ) and fear of underperformance are forcing even skeptics into the market . <p> On top of that , the bulls may gain a powerful ally that could fire up the market even more : the cash-rich pension-fund investor . The thrust here is the need for greater gains than they can get in the bond market to meet their pension obligations . <p> " Stocks are overpriced , but we see nothing that 'll jolt the uptrend , " says Peter Thompson , investment chief of David L. Babson &; Co. , a $ 5 billion investment manager in Cambridge , Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the upper end of valuation levels . " He relates it to the big three measurements used by investors to gauge stock values price-earnings multiples , dividend yields and book values . <p> Still , with interest rates falling , an economic recovery in place and Clinton 's economic package a reasonable first step , no one wants to bet against current market momentum , he says . " Markets are a creature of momentum , and today 's momentum is in one direction up . " <p> Babson , in line with its policy , is fully invested in stocks . But Thompson says he could see a relatively shallow market selloff maybe 5% to 10% . <p> A look at how the big guns are playing the market shows that they expect stocks to continue to romp . That 's according to institutional tracker Indata . Latest cash reserves covering 1,360 stock portfolios that have assets of $ 258 billion stood at 4.5% the week ended March 5 . As you see in the chart , that 's only a bit higher than the ' 92 close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading in February ' 92 . That 's the lowest level Indata has recorded in the 13 years it has tracked the big guns . <p> So despite all their griping , the institutional fraternity is loaded with closet bulls . <p> A couple of Indata charts also show you the biggest buys and sales by the fat cats in the week ended March 5 . <p> A big plus , as I mentioned earlier : Low rates could force giant pension funds to rethink their investment makeup and shift some bond money into stocks . If that were to happen what with pension funds holding $ 2.7 trillion of investment assets it could fuel a sustained market advance . <p> Take , for example , the California Public Employees Retirement System , which has 45% of its $ 72 billion of assets in stocks . There has been speculation , given falling rates and its need to meet pension obligations , that it might put another $ 3.5 billion into stocks in the pursuit of higher returns . <p> DeWitt Bowman , Calpers investment boss , tells me the $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's possible that Calpers could add a couple of billion dollars to its stock base for the longer term . Its actuaries , he says , assume an 8 3/4% return to meet pension-fund commitments . " And that 's hard to do when the long bond ( 30-year Treasury ) is yielding only 6 3/4% , " Bowman says . <p> His stock market view : " It 's running ahead of itself . Stocks are overpriced , and a lot of enthusiasm will be tempered later on . " That tempering process , he says , will reflect recognition that Clinton 's economic package wo n't achieve as much or occur as quickly as people expect . <p> About 7% of Calpers assets are in real estate an area that 's attracting growing numbers of investors as a result of falling mortgage rates . Bowman 's not that bullish . " We may be hitting the bottom of the trough , but a good recovery , especially in office buildings , is a long way off , " he says . <p> Getting back to stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And some are doing something about it . One is powerhouse investor Peter Anderson , who is hiking his cash reserves . Anderson runs IDS Advisory , a Minneapolis money manager that has $ 10 billion of assets . <p> Why more cash ? It 's his negative view of Clinton 's economic package . His view of Clinton 's package : " It 's just one massive tax hike . Spending cuts will evaporate as fast as snow in July . And none of this is any good for the financial markets . " <p> Based on its analysis , IDS argues that the Clinton plan , despite administration comments to the contrary , calls for about $ 3 of tax hikes for every dollar of spending cuts . <p> It means , says Anderson : <p> Economic growth will be less than expected . <p> Growth in corporate profits will be less than expected . <p> Confidence will erode among higher-income earners . <p> The stock market wo n't do as well as expected . <p> " The Clinton administration is groping for solutions , heightening the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious to what it says and does . " <p> Given its Clinton views and the impact it sees from his proposals , IDS has hiked cash reserves from an average 6-7% the past five years to 12% . <p> Anderson admits that the market , given its momentum , could nudge the Dow up to 3550-3575 from Thursday 's 3457 the next two to three weeks . But after that , he sees stocks going sideways to down the next six months . By year end , he sees the market little changed from where it is now . <p> Another skeptic though one who sees a big jump in the Dow before year end is William Pruett , chief investment officer of Memphis-based First Tennessee Investment Management ( assets : $ 3.3 billion ) . <p> " The market 's on high ground , namely P-E multiple and ( dividend ) yield , and easily could be frightened , " he tells my colleague Jerilyn Klein . <p> He figures any rash of earnings disappointments could scare investors and send the Dow skidding 10% to 12% in a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt if the government , as he expects , talks about tightening the reins on other industries as it has with drugs . An example : tougher environmental rules that would cost industrial companies , such as steel , chemical and oil , a pretty penny . <p> What 's more , if Clinton 's economic plan falls apart when it gets to Congress a scenario perceived by many but not by him Pruett figures we could see a more severe correction , maybe some 15% to 20% that could last up to six months . <p> However , Pruett thinks the Dow could bounce back to at least 3700 by year end as investors start focusing on an improving ' 93 economy that 'll extend into ' 94 . So it 's no surprise that he 's zooming in on the stocks of some companies that could benefit from a better economy . <p> His top picks : Scott Paper , Federal Paper Board , Ford , General Motors , Ingersoll-Rand and Keystone International . Ditto Intel , Apple Computer , Browning-Ferris and Waste Management . He sees them racking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18% in 12 months . <p> So that 's an update on the institutional front .
