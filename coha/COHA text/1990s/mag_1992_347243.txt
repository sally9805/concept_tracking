INCUMBENCY USED TO PROVIDE A COMFORTABLE cushion for elected officials , especially members of the U.S. Congress . In the past four elections , House members had a re-election rate of over 95% . But the cushion has got rather lumpy in 1992 , leaving a lot of sitting solons squirming in  --  and sometimes out of  --  their seats . Primaries in seven states around the country last Tuesday dumped a few more tenants of the House . The numbers were not sensational : two Congressmen lost their seats . But that brings the total of incumbents rejected in primaries so far to 19 , one more than the previous record , set in 1946 . The pattern is unrelenting and the message clear : If you 've been in Washington lately , you 've got a problem . <P> Circumstances varied . Nine-term Democratic Representative Stephen Solarz of New York , a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , lost to Nydia Velazquez , former secretary of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the U.S. Solarz was partly the victim of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation , which it did . But Solarz was surely hurt by his 743 overdrafts at the House bank . In Massachusetts , 127 bad checks helped do in Democrat Chester Atkins , who lost to a former county prosecutor . <P> Though 1992 was supposed to be the Year of the Woman , it was not to be for former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro or for city comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman in New York . Repelled by a vicious campaign in which Holtzman accused Ferraro 's husband of ties to organized crime and questionable business dealings , voters put up a man , state attorney general Robert Abrams , instead . <P> But more often than not this year , women have been outsiders . And outsiders have fared well . In Washington State , 41-year-old Patty Murray , whose previous political experience amounts to one term in the state senate , cast herself as " just a mom in tennis shoes " and beat former seven-term Congressman Don Bonker for the opportunity to run against another Beltway insider , five-term Republican Congressman Rod Chandler , for the Senate seat vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman this year to make it onto a major party ticket for the Senate  --  another record . <P> Last week 's winnowing brings the total number of Representatives who will not be returning next January to 86 . Many more who managed to survive primary fights are still in jeopardy as they go into the general elections . In all , the House could have as many as 126 freshmen in January . How well these newcomers handle the complex problems bequeathed them by their departing predecessors is a question even more serious than the outcome of the vote in November . <P> CHART : NOT AVAILABLE <P> CREDIT : NO CREDIT <P> CAPTION : Going , Going Gone
