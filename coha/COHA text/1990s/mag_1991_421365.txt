It 's like mouthwash : Madison Avenue asks you to swallow it at least twice a day . <p> You 're bright , you 're ambitious , your finger is on the pulse of Peoria , and ever since you fibbed your way out of your first spanking , you 've realized there 's a useful vacuum in the part of your brain where shame usually resides . May we suggest a career in greenwashing , the hottest new trend in dissembling for profit ? <p> You got ta be willing to imply that your own dear mother would have liked the way your company clear-cuts redwoods . Louisiana-Pacific 's president did it in magazine ads . You got ta be able to write an ad headline like EVERY DAY IS EARTH DAY WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY . It really raft . Let 's say a year and a half ago , you immersed a prime San Francisco Bay wetlands area in spilled oil . Could you , without laughing now , or even noticeably perspiring , ceremoniously give the nearest town a bronze statue of John Muir inscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the humongous chutzpah to broadcast the image of wildlife literally clapping for Du Pont , one of the nation 's top polluters ? How about this extra touch : Beethoven 's " Ode to Joy " swells in the background . It 's been on TV . <p> The advertising and public-relations industries have long been paid to jujitsu potential anticorporate movements into image builders for their clients . But their attempted co-opting of environmentalism has been so frenzied , so nakedly nineties as to make Orwell 's imagination seem stunted . And yet , because most of the media rely on the greenwashers for ad revenue , it 's been hard to find anyone who is willing to shout that the emperor has dropped trow . Until now ... The Scratch ' n ' Sniff Pollution Solution <p> ARCO shared its clean-air manifesto in a full-page ad in the eco-supplement to Fortune right around Earth Day . Under the headline IT 'LL HELP CUT OUT AIR POLLUTION , the petroleum giant listed ten things it wants us to do more of , like " Rideshare " and " Combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and braking . " ARCO printed these on one of those tree-shaped air-fresheners that you hang from your rearview mirror , with a thoughtful dotted line to follow when cutting it out , and the invitation , " Scratch tree to release scent . " That 'll come in especially handy in the Los Angeles smog belt , where ARCO 's Carson refinery has been the second-highest emitter of particulate matter ( 596 tons ) , the second-highest of sulfur dioxide ( 893 tons ) , and third-highest for total hydrocarbons ( 1,348tons ) . Take the little tree along to Alaska , too , where , in 1985 and 1986 alone , ARCO was cited for 229 excesses of state air quality standards , most of them involving spewing a particularly foul , black carbon smoke , which the right technology could prevent . <p> What few realized , until informative ads started appearing , is that without a benevolent hand from big oil , nature itself would get all confused and despondent and just give up . Chevron 's " People Do " series works this theme especially brazenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Earth Island Journal and the San Francisco Bay Guardian . Turns out that most of the animal-friendly initiatives that Chevron brags about in its **26;505;TOOLONG TV and print campaign are required by law , and not voluntary as the ads imply . Example : " On a moonlit California desert , a kit fox senses a prowling coyote , " the narrator intones , as we see fox dodge wily coyote by diving into " a cozy den that 's designed to keep her snug and safe . " Then : " Do people think of things like this just to help an endangered species make it through the night ? People do . " The artificial-den program is part of Chevron 's forced compliance with the Endangered Species Act . When Chevron produced the television ad in 1986 , it had only three artificial dens . Two of them were acquired from Gulf Oil when Chevron bought that company , and the third was not so snug : it had been specially built with a cutaway side view for the camera . Producing such a commercial can cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit-fox dens . The fox that Chevron filmed , incidentally , was a borrowed and trained captive . <p> It 's hard to pick the boldest lies advertised by slippery oil . In the op-ed-page corner that it rents in the New York Times , for example , Mobil asserts , " Just because we get our hands dirty does n't mean we dirty the environment , too . " This is the Mobil that spilled 455,696 gallons of oil from 1984 to 1988 , and whose workers contend that lead and benzene at the Beaumont , Texas , plant have been handled so sloppily that they are linked to cancer and birth defects in the area . Mobil 's Torrance , California , plant settled a civil complaint in 1989 for hazardous-waste violations . <p> Still , Texaco deserves a special star . Do IT RIGHT , blares the fat headline over a picture of smiley Texaco senior petroleum engineer Victor Simon and his assurance : " We have a corporate responsibility to do business with a conscience . This includes ensuring that the issues we are all passionate about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked .... In every step of our operations , from obtaining emission permits to ensuring on-site safety , simply meeting legislated standards is n't enough . We can and do exceed such standards .... " Why is this man smiling ? In 1989 , Texaco was fined $750,000 in the first-ever felony conviction under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act , for failing to perform tests of crucial oil-rig blowout-protection equipment , and then fabricating records of those tests . In 1989 , Texaco was cited <p> for violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , which protects certain species of birds , including the ones found dead in the company 's open oil-waste pits . That year , more birds died in oil companies ' waste pits than from the Valdez spill . Also , in 1988 , a Texaco subsidiary was ordered to pay the largest settlement ever under California 's Hazardous Waste Control Act , $8.95 million for neglecting to properly clean up the area around five thousand corroded , leaking drums of hazardous waste . According to the EPA , Texaco 's Port Neches , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . Garbage In , Garbage Out <p> Waste Management , Inc. , an ad explains , does the favor of " helping the world dispose of its problems . " That 's greenwashspeak for the fact that WMI and its chemical ( ChemWaste Management ) and nuclear ( ChemNuclear ) subsidiaries make up the biggest waste-dumping company in the world . Granted , the Waste Management empire did n't create the trillion pounds of toxic waste generated in the United States every year ; it just hauls it , burns it , injects it into the earth , and sticks it into landfills . In so doing , it paid out between $20 million and $40 million in environment-related penalties , fines , and settlements in the 1980s . It also was hit with $8.5 million in fines and other settlements for efforts to destroy competitors by price-fixing , etc . <p> " What sort of a wildlife preserve is this ? " asks the narrator for a WMI TV spot , while a soft-focus lens pans over rolling green hills and a butterfly flutters in the foreground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . developed by Waste Management . " The viewer is n't told that , in 1988 , toxics from one WMI landfill leaked into the soil below a canyon occupied by an endangered type of butterfly . Dozens of other landfills tend to endanger hard-strapped communities . In rural , mostly black Emelle , Alabama , CWM has dumped over 3.5 million tons of toxics , and paid one million dollars in environmental penalties . The Emelle hazardouswaste dump  --  one of the world 's largest and still growing-occasionally catches fire , and authorities are resigned to the fact that it will leak into local water sources . Although the data has been challenged , residents say that an independent lab has found toxic chemicals in residents ' bodies . Linda Wallace Campbell , an Emelle organizer , says it 's no accident that hazardous waste gets dumped in areas like hers , where the average yearly income is nine thousand dollars . " Yeah , they 're helping the world dispose of people of color , poor people , " says Campbell . " We 've got a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV classic shows the earth with a list of nasty chemicals scrolling up the screen . Voice-over : " In just three years , we 've made over two hundred million pounds of hazardous waste vanish from the face of the earth , destroying it with high-temperature incineration .. , without harm to the environment . We call that making progress . " WMI paid a $4,475,000 fine in 1989 because , among other violations , those in charge of its big " state of the art " Chicago incinerator failed to monitor emissions and stop burning deadly PCB wastes when protective scrubbers and stack monitors were n't working . More progress : In 1988 , the Illinois EPA temporarily closed the incinerator because ( oops ) operators disconnected pollution detectors in the stack . Sell My Mother ? How Much ? <p> " We need everything that 's out there .... We log to infinity . Because we need it all . It 's ours . It 's out there , and we need it all . Now . " That 's what Louisiana-Pacific chairman Harry Merlo , whose company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Democrat reporter Mike Geniella a while back . What does a public-relations pro say to a guy like that , especially since , true to his convictions , Merlo has harvested trees faster than they grow , while giving big money to defeat forest-protection initiatives ? Get me rewrite ! <p> Here 's Merlo in full-page ads that have appeared in Fortune and other magazines : " Respect for the environment is nothing new to me . From the time I was a small boy in a poor family of Italian immigrants , I 've understood how precious our God-given resources are , and how important it is never to waste them . The lessons I learned from my mother , Clotilde Merlo  --  lessons of thrift , common sense , hard work , and strength of purpose  --  I have not forgotten for a single day . " <p> Little Harry also learned from Mrs. Merlo , according to the ad , that " God is in the water . " God had better get out and shower off : L-P 's Samoa , California , pulp mill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty million gallons of effluent into the Pacific Ocean every day . Surfers tired of getting rashes from the resulting " black goo , " as they describe it , are , through the Surfrider Foundation , suing . DP could pay up to seventy-five million dollars if it loses . The judge who denied L-P 's motion for dismissal of the suit wrote : " They have essentially exempted themselves from all environmental protection requirements and are therefore free to discharge potential chronically toxic effluent into the waters of the Pacific Ocean with impunity . The position is disingenuous and flies in the face of the Clean Water Act . " <p> God seems to have forsaken a good portion of Silicon Valley 's water , too , since IBM arrived on the scene . The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition has been documenting IBM 's footdragging on cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination that they say potentially exposed more than 100,000 residents to chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects . And yet , IBM 's denial of this connection may explain its glorious double-pager , which has run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , a pristine body of water . The headline : IN A CHANGING WORLD , SOME THINGS DESERVE TO REMAIN JUST THE WAY THEY ARE . <p> Might the ozone layer be one of those deserving things ? Well , IBM has promised to phase out its massive chlorofluorocarbon use by 1993 , which environmentalists are calling a victory won only after heavy pressure . IBM 's San Jose , California , Endicott , New York , and Rochester , Minnesota , facilities were the top three CFC-113 emitters in 1987  --  over a decade after CFCs were known to shred the ozone layer . Now that IBM is swearing off CFCs , its substitute for washing computer chips will be detergent and distilled water , dried with ultrasound vibration . That technology was around before CFC-113 was introduced . ( See Mother Jones , December 1989 . ) <p> Even if IBM is finally getting around to leaving the ozone alone , Du Pont is n't about to stop messing with it . All those critters on TV applauding to Beethoven are ostensibly jazzed because Du Pont-Conoco is finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals that Du Pont is one of the world 's largest makers of ozone-shredding chemicals , and plans to continue producing them until at least the year 2000 . Du Pont also happened to be the United States ' leading toxic polluter in 1988 , according to the Citizens Fund report Poisons in Our Neighborhoods . Something else to clap about : despite the EPA phaseout of leaded gasoline , Du Pont is still producing lead additives , selling them more and more out of the country . David Schwartzman of Howard University 's Geology and Geography department calls these exports " a crime against children , " since immature brains and nervous systems are extremely vulnerable to lead poisoning . Now how does " Ode to Joy " go again ? For That Get-Up-and-Glow Feeling <p> POLLUTERS ARE THE REAL ANIMALS . This folksy reminder , scrawled on a sign hoisted by a cute little cartoon bear , adorns a full-page ad for the nuclear industry . Where , then , does that put nuke executives on the food chain ? After all , the total accumulation of high-level radioactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250,000 years while we try to solve where to put it . Meanwhile , the volume of low-level radioactive waste has more than doubled , and today bloats three commercial landfills . Nuclear advocates are getting an official ear for their solution : label one-third of it " below regulatory concern " and treat it like the coffee grounds in your own trash can . Thus reclassified , low-level radiation could find its way into incinerators , dumps , sewers , and rivers . That could kill up to 250,000 people , a figure based on EPA estimates . <p> Every day is mishap day with nuclear energy . In fact , the industry has reported 34,300 nuclear " mishaps , " nearly ten a day , since 1980 . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission concluded that the chances of a severe core meltdown occurring at one of the 112 licensed U.S. plants in the next fifteen years is as high as 45 percent . West German and Swedish scientists have said there is a 70 percent chance of a Chernobyl-scale accident happening somewhere in the world every six years . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at an all-time high . <p> Which explains those expensive ads trumpeting nuclear power as foe of air pollution and greenhouse gases , and alternative to dependence on messy foreign oil . Just running such ads by nuclear power 's propaganda organization , The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness , has n't afforded enough exposure , as far as the Wall Street Journal is concerned . The paper sent reprints to members of Congress , along with a letter , from WSJ vice-president for marketing Bernard T. Flanagan , calling them " informative and thought-provoking . " Lucrative , too . <p> The differences between what the greenwashers say and really do is so consistently , as Mrs. Merlo would say , clear cut , that one wonders where they peg the public 's gullibility limit . While General Electric trills , " We bring good things to life , " it profits from deadly nuclear-weapons work , having helped create the radioactive nightmares at Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the Knolls Atomic Power Lab-hence the ongoing boycott of GE . With lovingly rendered animal portraits , GE proudly advertises its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglects to mention that according to Citizens Fund , it ranks number one in Superfund sites and released more cancer-causing chemicals into the environment in 1988 than any other U.S. company . One of the most breathtaking exercises in mock humility is the two-pager taken out by that friend of the environment , the Chemical Manufacturer 's Association . The ad literally promises the world : over a picture of the earth runs the headline HANDLE WITH RESPONSIBLE CARE , followed by the group 's " guiding principles , " like " To develop and produce chemicals that can be manufactured , transported , used , and disposed of safely . " Union Carbide , of the Bhopal disaster , is one of the 170 signees . <p> " It 's not that all these ads are untrue . They depict 5 percent of environmental virtue to mask the 95 percent of environmental vice , " says Greenpeace 's media director , Peter Dykstra . " There 's a real moral vacuum in how people deal with advertising . " Dykstra passes along a prime example of the greenwasher 's ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York public-relations firm Hill and Knowlton , Inc . <p> " We need your help . We know from your work that you recognize how critically important it is to reverse the declining quality of our air , land , and water , and to safeguard these resources before they are spoiled forever , " wrote H &K; vice-president Jeffrey L. Christmas , entreating Greenpeace USA 's executive director , Peter Bahouth , to help promote a globally televised enviro-concert called Earth ' 90 . <p> Not long before , the same Hill and Knowlton had written to suspected Mississippi River polluters , warning that Greenpeace might make them a protest target and offering seasoned expertise : " Hill and Knowlton veterans have worked on almost every major crisis in recent years , including Three Mile Island , Texas Eastern 's PCB problem , the dioxin crisis , and Ashland 's Ohio River oil spill . " In case there is any doubt which side H &K; represented in all those cases , the letter , leaked by a temp worker , goes on to suggest that firms hire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reaches your facilities .... " <p> H &K's; Howard Marder , who wrote the letter , told Mother Jones that he sees " no contradiction " in the fact that his company tried to make money by both courting and countering Greenpeace . He says that he always advises clients to tell the " whole truth immediately . " Did he research the pollution records of any of the companies along the Mississippi before offering to speak for them ? No , says Marder , whose letter to one promises : " We can help select the most effective spokesman to convince the community and media of your credibility . The way the message is delivered by the company 's spokesman is as important as the message itself . " The italics are Hill and Knowlton 's own . It 's an old trick of the trade . Makes a word like credibility seem more credible . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Half-truth in advertising is elevated to high art by the nuclear industry .
