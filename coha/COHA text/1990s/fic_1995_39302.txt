HER eyes  --  leaning closer to the magnifying mirror , Elaine could read the future in her eyes . Not so long ago one of her best features , they now seemed less brown , less deep , less alive with the hope and promise they once held . Despite ministrations with moisturizers and creams , the skin at the corners had begun to show crinkles . Her once lush lashes seemed thinner , even slightly scraggly , and needed lots of help . Pouches had not yet formed-be patient , she told herself , these , too , will arrive soon enough . The rims tended to redden , especially at night , a condition worsened by many ears of wearing contact lenses . She had finally given up the lenses , to which she never quite adjusted , four years ago , just after the divorce from Jacob . <p> Had she been more beautiful as Mrs. Jacob Kessler , the third wife of the famous pianist , than as Elaine Goldman Kessler , the forty-four-year-old divorced mother of an eight-year  --  old son , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much more impressed with her as Mrs. Jacob Kessler . Hotel managers , matres d ' , store clerks knocked themselves out to arrange the best tables , the most capacious suites , the quietest and most comfortable surroundings . Limousines awaited her exit from grand hotels ; first-class was the only air travel she knew . Except for the month they spent ever summer at Jacob 's place in Maine , near Castine , the details of cooking , cleaning , and other domestic chores were assumed to be beneath her notice  --  these days , working at a full-time job , she sometimes seemed to have time for little else  --  and even at Castine they had a cook four nights a week . The better part of her ten ears as Mrs. Jacob Kessler had been quite magical  --  the most interesting part of her life , Elaine thought . <p> She had known about Jacob , of course , even owned some of his recordings , but had not met him until the first night she heard him play in concert . It was in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavilion but in the snug Murray Theater she so much preferred . She had been invited to meet him at a party after the concert at the Wasserburgs . Leonard Wasserburg was a former patient of Elaine 's father , a very rich man and a major benefactor of the Ravinia festival . She was n't at all sure she cared to go . but that night Jacob played the Schubert Impromptus , Mozart 's Piano Sonata No. 2 in F , and the Beethoven Pathetique , whose second movement , the adagio , she particularly loved . <p> Elaine 's seat was only five rows from the stage of the small theater . She noted Jacob 's face , with its flared nostrils , fleshy ears , thick eyebrows , longish hair beginning td go silver at the temples , dark skin  --  the overall effect very Jewish yet aristocratic . Jacob Kessler was an aristocrat of art , Elaine formulated it to herself that night , someone who had been permitted knowledge of its inner secrets , one of the elect . For his encore , he played Ravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he seemed to play everything , without effort , his head and shoulders perfectly still , but with a beautifully controlled passion . She watched the slender strong hands returning to Ravel 's plaintive theme and thought , in a flash of pure eroticism , of how they would feel playing over her body . <p> At the Wasserburgs ' house on the lake in Glencoe , amid the Matisse , the Motherwells , the Fairfield Porter , and the large Frankenthaler , he approached her . She was then twenty-nine , he forty-three She had never married . He was recently divorced from his second wife . He was delighted , he claimed , to learn that she was n't a musician , had n't even had an musical training . <p> " Forgive me , " he said , " I took you for a cellist . " <p> " Really ? Why ? " <p> " A little psychological vice . My world is almost entirely bounded b music . I assume that anyone I meet at such evenings has musical interests , and I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cello ? " <p> " Deep strings , capable of passion and also darkness ; I guess I saw such things in you . I think you would be correct to take it as a compliment . " <p> " I will , " she said . <p> " In any case , I 'm thrilled to be wrong . " <p> " Why is that ? " <p> " At least now I wo n't have to shlep a cello case on planes and trains . " <p> Elaine did n't press him further . She had her car with her , the seven-year-old red Toyota her father had bought for her when she graduated from Wellesley , and two hours later he asked if she minded driving him the few miles to his hotel in Lake Forest . At the hotel , he wondered if she could be persuaded to stay for a nightcap . After a drink , he asked her to stay the night . Although it was n't at all her way , she agreed without hesitation . They made love , fortissimo and pinnissimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ravel 's beautiful little pavane echoing in her head . <p> Her fear that she had been no more than a night 's entertainment was put to rest when , two days later , he sent her a first-class plane ticket to Washington , where he was playing the same program at Wolf Trap the following weekend . He called the evening the ticket arrived , and she told him she would be there . In a calm , warmly reassuring voice , he said he was glad . <p> Elaine stayed in his suite at the Ritz-Carlton , near Dupont Circle . At breakfast Sunday morning in the Jockey Club , John Houseman came up to their table . Jacob had known the actor a long time , and they spoke as intimates . <p> " I 'd like you to meet my fiancee , Elaine Goldman , " Jacob said . <p> " How pleasing ! " Houseman replied , not immediately releasing Elaine 's hand . " My very best wishes , Miss Goldman . " <p> When he left , Elaine , her fork playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knee , was unable to look up . <p> " That 's a funny way to go about it , " she said . " I mean , learning you 're engaged through conversation with a third party . " <p> " I 'm afraid I was using old John as a conduit , as they say in the CIA . But I really do hope you 'll marry me . " <p> " Do you usually move so quickly ? " <p> " In these matters I do . It 's only the small things in life  --  what tie to wear , what to order for dessert  --  that I agonize over . Important things never seem to detain me for long , or at least they never have . " <p> " I hope you wo n't mind if I take some time to think all this through . " <p> " Take all the time you need . I know you 'll make the correct decision and conclude , as I already have , that we belong together . " <p> Jacob went on to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . She had her job at Leo Burnett , the ad agency , where she was a media buyer ; her apartment in Sandburg Village , for which her father had given her the down payment ; her friends , most of them by now married and with children and living in Highland Park or Northbrook . But life in Chicago , after a long weekend with Jacob Kessler , suddenly felt very unreal . Or was it the time , the quite magical time , spent with Jacob that seemed unreal ? <p> When she told her father about it  --  Elaine 's mother had died of a stroke two years before  --  at lunch at the Standard Club , he showed his usual , unexcited reaction . Dr. David Goldman , the noted oncologist , senior physician on the staff of Michael Reese Hospital , was a careful man . He was too careful , in fact too subtle , to tell his daughter not to act rashly . He took a different tack , assuming , as he always had with her , that she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without complication . <p> " I know you 've taken into consideration that you will be this man 's third wife . You must have thought about your prospects of pleasing him when two women before you were unable to . " <p> " I have thought about it , Daddy , " she said . " And I 'm afraid I do n't have a very intelligent reason for thinking that I can do better . I 'm not under illusions that I possess some secret charm that 'll change his character . What 's worse , I 'm not sure I want to change it . He 's very dashing . " <p> " There are children from the other marriages ? " <p> " Two daughters , ten and eight , both from the first marriage . They live with their mother . " <p> " Does he see much of them ? " <p> " As much as possible , but , you know , he travels a good deal , both here and abroad , concertizing . " " I see , " said Dr. Goldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine was pretty sure that he did n't see , not really . <p> THE main dining room at the Standard Club was filled with men who reminded her of her father . They were solid , substantial men , earnest , responsible , serious  --  men with gravity . Elaine always felt she would marry a younger version of such a man herself : a physician , perhaps , like her father , or a lawyer ; in any case a professional man with all that " professional " implied in the way of competence , command , control . And security . <p> Looking around at all these men in their various dark grey and blue suits and subdued neckties , she thought of Jacob 's get-up when he left her at the airport in Washington : soft Italian loafers , tan twill trousers , a buttery soft , blue cashmere blazer , a thick red-striped shirt with white collar and white cuffs from Asser &; Turnbull  --  Asshole &; Turncoat , he called them , when she asked  --  and a rich multicolored ascot from Charvet . Imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . <p> " Well , " her father said , " is there any great hurry about all this ? " <p> " I think Jacob would like an answer before too long . " <p> " What is it likely to be ? " <p> " You know , Daddy , being married to a man like Jacob provides every opportunity for an interesting life . " <p> " An interesting life ? " Her father 's quizzical look suggested that the concept was a fresh and quite strange one to him . <p> " By which I mean , " she continued , " living for long stretches in Europe , meeting artists , a life surrounded by music and beauty . <p> " I can see where it all must seem very seductive , " her father said . " But you wo n't truly be at the center of it , you know . Your claim will always be through your husband 's talent . " <p> " Life is very pleasing with this man , Daddy . It 's more intense , exciting , richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met or I 'm likely to meet . " <p> " What do you know about his family ? Are his parents still living ? " <p> " Neither is . He was brought up in Cincinnati . He was a piano prodigy . They were n't wealthy people . His father worked in the wholesale grocery business . Jacob 's mother was the key figure in his life . " <p> Elaine did n't stop to tell her father that , from the age of seven until he was seventeen , Jacob had had a patroness . A wealthy German-Jewish woman in Cincinnati , a Mrs. Loretta Binstock , put him on an allowance of $250 a month , to be used for lessons , private tutoring , clothes for recitals , and other expenses . She also paid his way to the Interlochen music camp in the summers . He was , as Jacob told Elaine , something like her house pet , invited to play for her guests , taught table manners , not infrequently humiliated for his youthful Ostjuden crudities . " Mrs. Binstock got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject . <p> " So , like you , he 's an only child ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Only children need lots of attention . I do n't worry about where he 's going to get his . But where will you get yours ' " <p> " In good part from him , I hope . But do you think I need so much ? " <p> " Truth is , you never did . You were always a good girl . Everything I wanted in a daughter . " <p> " That means a lot to me . " <p> " Sweetheart , you know I only wish you well . All I ask is that you retain your good judgment and remain as thoughtful as you 've been all your life . What can the father of an intelligent woman hope but that she not make more than the allotted number of mistakes in a lifetime ? You have my blessing . " <p> " I knew I would , Daddy . In time I hope to have your complete approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality in Jacob that I do . I do n't hope , really  --  I know you will . " She covered his hand  --  his mottled , dry , veiny hand  --  with her own . <p> Dr. Goldman met his son-in-law only four times , for he died two years later of a heart attack , three years before the birth of the grandson who was named after him . <p> ELAINE and Jacob were married , in London , a month after her lunch with her father . They had their honeymoon while Jacob played concerts across Europe . She sold her Chicago apartment with everything in it , and moved into Jacob 's large place on West End Avenue in New York . The apartment was dark , stuffed with books and records , and had two grand pianos . Nothing in the life she lived in Chicago had prepared her for life with Jacob . <p> Elaine soon came to understood that her husband wished to reside on the same august heights as Vladimir Horowitz . He thought of himself as Horowitz 's spiritual heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quasi-composer . Jacob imagined  --  he told her as much  --  that the line from Franz Liszt , to Anton Rubinstein , to Vladimir Horowitz ended with Jacob Kessler . True , a large number of his contemporaries were impressive in their way  --  Brendel , Ax , Perahia , the younger ( though no longer very ) Serkin among them . Then there were the lesser figures : Dichter , de Larrocha , Watts , and scores of others whom he need not worry about . But none had emerged as the pianist of the age as , even in semi-retirement , Horowitz indisputably still was . <p> In the early years of their marriage , Elaine went on tour with Jacob to Brussels , Barcelona , Athens , Jerusalem . His easy cosmopolitanism thrilled her . This boy from Cincinnati , once roughly instructed in table manners by a German Jewess whose husband owned a downtown department store , was now utterly at ease in Paris , Rome , and London . <p> Wherever Jacob played , adulation followed . Audiences adored him ; critics tended to agree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , no money worries whatsoever  --  it was a fine life . " Ah , Mrs. Kessler , " the Vicomtesse de Rothschild told Elaine one evening at a small dinner party , " Your husband is a great artist , among the very greatest , and we are honored to have him here in Paris  --  and you with him , of course . " <p> Not that life was perpetually so exhilarating . At home , back in New York , there was Jacob 's unrelenting schedule of work . He had once told Elaine of a psychologist interested in artistic achievement who estimated that to become an accomplished piano soloist one needed to begin by the age of four and to have practiced 10,000 hours ; to begin as late as eight and to have practiced a mere 8,000 hours condemned one to achieving nothing higher than the third rank . He estimated that he must have practiced for something like 12,000 hours . He had begun , under his mother 's supervision , at the age of three . At six , he told Elaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , formally declare war on Japan and Germany and announce that every American must now do his all . After turning off the radio , his mother had placed her hands on his little shoulders , looked him in the eye , and said , " Jacob , you have just heard your President say that everyone must help the war effort . What you must do , my son , is practice the piano more than ever . " <p> Jacob practiced mornings , generally from nine to one . He always went reluctantly into the room he called his studio , dawdling over a third cup of coffee , asking for another piece of toast . He practiced in pajamas and robe . Elaine would listen as she moved around the apartment . Sometimes he would play compositions straight through , sometimes he would play a movement or a passage over and over and over again . On occasion , she would hear him curse himself . " Stupid ! " he would yell . " Idiot ! Get the damn thing right ! " One morning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mendelssohn Sonata in G Major , she smiled as she heard him cry out , " Goddamn Clara Schumann ! " At lunch , when she asked , he told her that it was Clara Schumann who had begun the tradition of playing in concert without musical notation , thus forcing all future virtuosi to do likewise . " It damn near drove poor Myra Hess to suicide , you know . " Elaine did not , but it did n't seem to matter . <p> SHE would sometimes look in on him during these practice sessions . Unlike in performance , during difficult passages he sometimes ground his jaw , waggled his chin , moved his lips . ( When asked , he said he was talking to the long-dead composer , checking to see if he got it right . ) During more relaxed passages he did a fine thing with his head , holding it high and off to the side . The utter seriousness of it all impressed Elaine immensely . She felt as if she had married a great athlete , but an athlete engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she still could n't quite believe she was married to this man , let alone now pregnant by him . <p> They never really discussed having a baby . After a few years of being careful , they simply did nothing to prevent it . Elaine 's pregnancy was n't easy . Horrendous morning sickness attacked her well past her first trimester . She did not speak much about her illness to Jacob . He was nearly fifty years old , a man with adolescent daughters living on the West Coast and an important career in constant cultivation at home . Going to Lamaze classes with her was quite out of the question-not even a broachable subject . <p> How different this pregnancy would have been in Chicago , Elaine thought . There would have been old friends who had gone through it before or were perhaps going through it now with a third or fourth child . There would have been lunches with much talk about baby clothes and plans for fixing up a nursery . There would no doubt have been a baby shower or two . Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob was not unsympathetic , but she understood that  --  how exactly to put it ?  --  his interest was not fully engaged . <p> With a career of the kind he had chosen , how could it be ? In fact , it turned out that Jacob 's agent at CAMI had arranged a European tour for him during the time that Elaine was to deliver their child . He asked if she wished to travel with him and have the baby in Oslo or Stockholm or Copenhagen . She thought about it and decided , no , it would be better to stay in New York , where she had confidence in her obstetrician , a burly , jokey man who reminded her of one of her father 's friends . Jacob offered to cancel the tour . Elaine said absolutely not , though she would have loved it if he had not merely offered but actually done it . When her son was born , Jacob , in Stockholm , sent two dozen long-stemmed roses and a magnum of champagne to the hospital . Elaine , from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink it . She remembered , too , that he had had an unbreakable concert date in Los Angeles the day of her father 's funeral . <p> Having understood the scope of Jacob 's ambition  --  or at least believing she understood it  --  Elaine wished she could find a way to help him achieve what he wanted . But she had n't the foggiest notion how . When she asked , he replied that merely being herself , being there for him , meant a great deal , really it meant everything . After David was born , she was able to persuade him to move from the West Side . She found a much lighter if slightly less roomy place on East 64th , off Park . He agreed to give up his second piano so that a room could be turned into a nursery for their infant son . Elaine handled all the details of the move . <p> Jacob insisted they hire a nanny . Elaine did n't see the need for it . But he wanted his wife to have the freedom to travel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to continue breast-feeding , but at the end of three months Jacob asked her to stop ; it interfered with their travel plans and cut into their social life . Jacob was attentive to the child , but , after all , he was a man who had been through this not once but twice before with his own daughters . Children and artists did not entirely go smoothly together ; in any case , in an artistic household , the needs of the artist , it was understood , came first . <p> On a day that Jacob was performing , for example , there was his special diet to be seen to : usually yogurt and perhaps a few strips of smoked salmon on very thin , lightly toasted bread . Coming out of his daily practice sessions , he was generally grumpy . Rather than giving him pleasure in his craft , practice reminded Jacob of all the things he wished to achieve at the piano but could not  --  not quite , or at least not quite well enough . He used to joke  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , and on Yom Kippur he read scores under the bed . <p> IT WAS not until they were married more than five years that Elaine met Jacob 's two daughters . Phoebe and Patricia were fifteen and thirteen , and had been brought up in San Diego , where Jacob 's first wife lived . He had paid for their schooling and for most of the other expense of raising them . Their mother , who played viola in chamber-music groups on the West Coast , had never remarried . The girls were in New York to visit an aunt . They were tallish and fair , thin and awkward . Patsy , as Jacob called the younger , wore complicated braces on both her upper and lower teeth . Phoebe , who had her father 's good looks , also inherited some of her parents ' musical ability ; she played oboe well enough , apparently , to consider doing so professionally . <p> Both girls were shy , and neither was able easily to negotiate the menu at the Russian Tea Room , where the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered blini and caviar for everyone , instructing the girls how to eat it and urging them to get used to the good things in life . Conversation did not flow easily . Elaine , feeling very much the outsider , attempted to question the girls about their schooling , about shopping in New York , and about anything else that came to mind  --  and not enough did . Their father braved his way through the meal with puns and less than successful jokes . My poor jokey Jakey , Elaine thought , trying so hard to convince them all that they were a normal , happy family . When the lunch was over , Elaine stood near the door of the restaurant as Jacob put the girls in a cab , not hugging but kissing each lightly on both cheeks . Their aunt was taking them to her summer place in New Hampshire and he would n't see them again this trip . <p> After this lunch , Elaine often wondered how Jacob could have walked away from these girls , so fragile , so vulnerable , left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her own father , who had been no less preoccupied than Jacob , working with cancer patients whom in most cases he knew he had no hope of saving , had nonetheless somehow managed to convey to Elaine that she made him proud , that at the end of another difficult day the sight of her refreshed him  --  that , despite everything else on his mind , life without her would have been less good . <p> The two men , Jacob and her father , were of different generations . Men of her father 's generation divorced only when they were driven to it . Without Jacob 's divorces , of course , Elaine would never have come into his life , nor would their beautiful son exist . Still , there were those two girls , with their thin legs , shyness , and braces who were being asked to pay the price for her happiness . <p> She was happy . She had her son and she had her much admired husband . Mrs. Jacob Kessler was not at all a bad thing to be . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic in his hands , and so abundant was it that some of this magic seemed almost to have rubbed off on her . The young woman at Vidal Sassoon who gave Elaine her manicures , and whose brother was taking piano lessons in Rego Park , one day asked that she autograph the inside packet of Jacob 's most recent CD : " To Jimmy , ' if you do n't mind . " Embarrassed , Elaine nevertheless signed . <p> " JA , " a sleepy voice on the other end answered . " <p> " Jacob ? " Elaine asked . <p> " One moment . " <p> " Jacob ? " <p> " Elaine ? " <p> " Who was that who answered the phone ? " " That was the maid , dear , come to turn down the bed . It 's nearly midnight in Amsterdam . How are you ? " <p> " I 'm fine , Jacob . Everything here 's fine . How goes the week ? " <p> " With Yervi all goes smoothly . The Concertgebouw remains a pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's fine . I had n't realized it was so late . You 'd think I 'd have European times down by now . " <p> " Not to worry , darling . Why do n't I call you tomorrow ? " <p> " Yes , do call . I love you . " <p> " I you . " <p> Elaine could n't get that voice out of her mind . It had spoken only three words  --  " Ja " and " One moment "  --  yet neither in intonation nor logic did they seem the words of a chambermaid . She played them over and over in her mind . Why did the voice sound so sleepy ? Would a maid really say " One moment " and promptly hand the phone to her husband ? Would a maid even answer the telephone when a guest was in the room ? The more Elaine thought , the more dubious the whole thing became . <p> She decided not to confront Jacob with her suspicions  --  more than suspicions . She felt she had arrived at this decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive and forget . Confronting Jacob would do no good  --  he would only deny it , he would act hurt  --  and it might even end their marriage . Disappointed though she was , Elaine was not ready to write finis to this union . Besides , there was David to consider . Should she deprive her little boy of his father just because she could n't bear the thought  --  the fact  --  of his unfaithfulness ? Of course not . <p> Elaine also had to recognize the possibility that she did n't want the marriage to end for her own sake . Divorce , dress it up any way you like , always meant failure , and she was n't ready to admit defeat . She was n't ready to become the third Mrs. Jacob Kessler , a sad sordid statistic . She preferred being the current  --  make that the final  --  Mrs. Jacob Kessler . She never mentioned the Amsterdam call to her husband . But a few months later , when Jacob sat down at the piano with their young son to test his pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for music , Elaine , for reasons not altogether clear to her , was secretly pleased . <p> Her marriage became a lie of convenience ; a lie , at any rate , was at the center of it . Other marriages survived with other lies at their centers . Men and women grew disappointed with each other ; passion grew stale ; small , once mildly irritating habits over the years drove husbands and wives nearly crazy with distaste . Still , all these people stayed with what they had ; they played on through . As , Elaine was determined , would she . If her husband felt the need occasionally to sleep with another woman , so long as he did so discreetly , well , let him . Jacob Kessler was not after all an ordinary man ; his moods , his needs , his life  --  all were somehow different . <p> Elaine , then , was prepared to live with things . A certain forbearance was called for ; so were certain actressy qualities . She surprised herself at how many she had . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed she easily enough pretended that nothing was wrong , nothing had changed . She discovered that she was more than a bit of an artist herself . <p> The evening Jacob played at the White House Elaine knew she had made the correct decision . It was still a good , an interesting , life . The First Lady , whom she sat next to at the concert , confided that Jacob Kessler was far and away her favorite among the pianists of his generation . She asked Elaine about her own musical background . " Me , " Elaine found herself answering , " Oh , I used to play the cello , but no longer . " <p> Subtly , almost imperceptibly , the center of gravity in Elaine 's marriage began to shift from her husband to her son . There was , after all , so little that she could do for Jacob and so much for David . She continued to take an interest in Jacob 's career , sharing concern about his newest recordings , his concert dates , the scuttlebutt about other pianists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them . But less and less did she travel with her husband , who himself seemed less and less to require her companionship . She assumed that on the road he found ways to look after his own needs , all of them . She did n't like to think about it . In the end , he returned to her and their son , that was the main thing . Things were under control . And so they remained for more than a year . <p> THE morning after the night Jacob learned he had won a Grammy for his six-CD recording of the Beethoven sonatas , which critics were comparing to Schnabel 's , a morning on which Jacob planned to celebrate by abstaining from practice and instead taking his son out to the park , began badly . It was nine-thirty . David was off in his room , his Filipino nanny , Mrs. Ramirez , helping him dress . " Elaine , " Jacob began , " I fear I have some dreary news . " <p> " Which is ? " she asked , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . <p> " Our marriage is over . " <p> Her half-full cup slipped from her hand , the coffee sluicing off the table onto the Oriental rug she had picked out with such care . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " what did you say ? " <p> " Over , " Jacob said . " I 've committed myself to someone else . " <p> " What about your commitment to me and to your son ? " <p> " There 'll be money to take care of you both . " <p> " I do n't think money 's quite the issue here , Jacob . " <p> " No , the issue is my career , in which , it seems to me , you long ago lost interest . " <p> " That 's not true , " Elaine said , not very authoritatively . <p> " I think it is . Besides , you must have known coming into this marriage what the arrangements were . " <p> " I thought I did . Maybe I was mistaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give you the short form . My career comes first . You had to know that . " <p> " Your sleeping with other women , in Amsterdam and God knows where else , is that also part of the arrangement ? " <p> " An artist has certain needs , whether you want to believe it or not . Whatever is good for his art is good for him . That 's just the way it is . " <p> " What about an artist 's wife ? What about her needs ? What about children ? " <p> " As far as I 'm concerned the world is organized for the creation of art , and nothing else matters . Not personal relations , not family , nothing . I know this is probably repugnant to you , but it 's my view  --  and I 'm stuck with it . " <p> Elaine knew that the next utterance , should she dare make it , would mark the end of her marriage . She could n't hold it back . <p> " But you just play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart pounding , " you do n't compose it . Faustian bargains are n't available to piano players , you idiot . " <p> Jacob did n't answer . He turned away . At just that moment David and Mrs. Ramirez entered the room . David was wearing a sailor suit . Jacob swept the boy , who looked so much like him , into his arms and headed for the door . <p> " We 'll return in an hour or so , " he called , without looking back . <p> IT TURNED out that the woman for whom Jacob left Elaine and David was Irish , twenty-three , and a flautist with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra . Her name was Meagan O'Donnell . As with Jacob 's two earlier wives , Elaine never met her . She would from time to time see pictures of the two of them in the fashion press , at a charity ball or benefit . <p> Jacob gave her no difficulty about the divorce . She came away with the equity in the apartment and $5,000 a month in combined alimony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay the expenses for his son 's education . This , added to the money she had inherited from her father , left her free from financial worry . Because of his traveling schedule , Jacob asked for no regular visitation rights and accepted Elaine 's assurance that he would be able to see the boy whenever it was convenient for him . <p> It turned out not to be very convenient , at any rate not very often . After Elaine sold the apartment , she and David moved back to Chicago . They lived on State Parkway , near North Avenue , and David , when five years old , was sent to Francis Parker School . He was a cheerful child . Whenever his father played in Chicago , David and he went off for an afternoon , and the boy returned a bit agitated but nothing worse . The effect on him of growing up without a father seemed to Elaine , in cooler moments , perhaps not so awful as she had expected  --  at least not yet . <p> When she first returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the musical life of the city : do volunteer work for the Chicago Symphony or the Lyric Opera , or get herself on the board of Music of the Baroque or one of the other institutions in the city .
