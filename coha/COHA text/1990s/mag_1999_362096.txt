In the dark , in the night , over the airwaves of 486 radio stations , they march : a parade of alien abductees and remote viewers ( " scientific " psychics ) , students of contrails and crop circles and reverse speech . Then there was the fellow who found and , he thought , killed an alien being in the Cascade Mountains . He stuffed the creature in a freezer in his garage and later heard it screaming to get out . A week afterward he saw three vans in front of his house and unknown men going in . He drove away . When he came back , they were all gone . The men . The vans . The alien . And the freezer . <P> That tale consumed three enthralling hours a while back on Coast to Coast AM , the 5-hr. - a- night radio show devoted to all things weird and shepherded by Art Bell , a genial host shrouded , until recently , in his own poignant mystery . Photo " evidence " of the parchment-skinned ET can be seen on Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
