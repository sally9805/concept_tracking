Mary Penn was sick , though she said nothing about it when she heard Elton get up and light the lamp and renew the fires . He dressed and went out with the lantern to mil and feed and harness the team . It was early in March , and she could hear the wind blowing , rattling things . She threw the covers off and sat up on the side of the bed , feeling as she did how easy it would be to let her head lean down again , onto her knees . But she got up , put on her dress and sweater , and went to the kitchen . <p> Nor did she mention her sickness when Elton came back in , bringing the milk , with the smell of the barn cold in his clothes . <p> " How 're you this morning ? " he asked her , giving her a pat as she strained the milk . <p> And she said , not looking at him , for she did not want him to know how she felt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sausage , and biscuits that she set in front of him , twice emptying the glass that he replenished from a large pitcher of milk . She loved to watch him eat  --  there was something curiously delicate in the way he used his large hands  --  but this morning she busied herself about the kitchen , not looking at him , for she knew he was watching her . She had not even set a plate for herself . <p> " You 're not hungry ? " he asked . <p> " Not very . I 'll eat something after a while . " <p> He put sugar and cream in his coffee , stirred rapidly with the spoon . And now he lingered a little . He did not indulge himself often , but this was one of his moments of leisure . He gave himself to his pleasures as concentratedly as to his work . He was never partial about anything ; he never felt two ways at the same time . It was , she thought , a kind of childishness in him . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be as entirely sad or angry . His glooms were the darkest she had ever seen . He worked as a hungry dog ate , and yet he could play at croquet or cards with the self-forgetful exuberance of a little boy . It was for his concentratedness , she supposed , if such a thing could be supposed about , that she loved him . That and her yen to just look at him , for it was wonderful to her the way he was himself in his slightest look or gesture . She did not understand him in everything he did , and yet she recognized him in everything he did . She had not been prepared  --  she was hardly prepared yet  --  for the assent she had given to him . <p> Though he might loiter a moment over his coffee , the day , she knew , had already possessed him ; its momentum was on him . When he rose from bed in the morning , he stepped into the day 's work , impelled into it by the tension , never apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do . The little hillside place that they had rented from his mother afforded him no proper scope for his ability and desire . They always needed money , but , day by day , they were getting by . Though this was yet another spring of the Depression , they were not going to be in want . She knew his need to surround her with a margin of pleasure and ease . This was his need , not hers , but when he was not working at home , he would be working , or looking for work , for pay . <p> This morning , delaying his own plowing , he was going to help Walter Cotman plow his corn ground . She could feel the knowledge of what he had to do tightening in him like a spring . She thought of him and Walter plowing , starting in the early light , and the two teams leaning into the collars all day , while the men walked in the opening furrows and the steady wind shivered the dry grass and shook the dead weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and pushed in his chair . She came to be hugged as she knew he wanted her to . <p> " It 's mean out , " he said . " Stay in today . Take care of yourself . " <p> " You , too , " she said . " Have you got on plenty of clothes ? " <p> " When I get ' em all on , I will . " He was already wearing an extra shirt , and a pair of overalls over his corduroys . Now he put on a sweater , his work jacket , his cap and gloves . He started out the door and then turned back . " Do n't worry about the chores . I 'll be back in time to do everything . " <p> " All right , " she said . <p> He shut the door . And now the kitchen was a cell of still lamplight under the long wind that passed without inflection over the ridgetops . <p> She cleared the table . She washed the few dishes he had dirtied and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs and the small dish cabinet that they had bought , and the large iron cooking stove that looked more permanent than the house . The stove , along with the bed and a few other sticks of furniture , had been there when they came . <p> She heard Elton go by with the team , heading out the lane . The daylight would be coming now , though the windowpanes still reflected the lamplight . She took the broom from its corner by the back door and swept and tidied up the room . They had been able to do nothing to improve the house , which had never been a good one and had seen hard use . The wallpaper , and probably the plaster behind , had cracked in places . The finish had worn off the linoleum carpets near the doorways and around the stoves . But she kept the house clean . She had made curtains . The curtains in the kitchen were of the same blue-and-white checkered gingham as the tablecloth . The nightstands were orange crates for which she had made skirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to keep , she had to make it neat and homey . It was her first house , and usually it made her happy . But not now . <p> She was sick . At first it was a consolation to her to have the whole day to herself to be sick in . But by the time she got the kitchen straightened up , even that small happiness had left her . She had a fever , she guessed , for every motion she made seemed to carry her uneasily beyond the vertical . She had a floaty feeling that made her unreal to herself . And finally , when she put the broom away , she let herself sag down into one of the chairs at the table . She ached . She was overpoweringly tired . <p> She and Elton had married a year and a half earlier , when she was seventeen and he eighteen . She had never seen anybody like him . He had a wild way of rejoicing , like a healthy child , singing songs , joking , driving his old car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . He could make her weak with laughing at him . And yet he was already a man as few men were . He had been making his own living since he was fourteen , when he had quit school . His father had been dead by then for five years . He hated his stepfather . When a neighbor had offered him cropland , room , and wages , he took charge of himself , and though he was still a boy , he became a man . He wanted , he said , to have to say thank you to nobody . Or to nobody but her . He would be glad , he said with a large grin , to say thank you to her . And he could do things . It was wonderful what he could accomplish with those enormous hands of his . She could have put her hand into his and walked right off the edge of the world . Which , in a way , is what she did . <p> She had grown up in a substantial house on a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old Kentucky family , proud of itself , always conscious of its position and of its responsibility to be itself . She had known from childhood that she would be sent to college . Almost from childhood she had understood that she was destined to marry a solid professional man , a doctor perhaps , or ( and this her mother particularly favored ) perhaps a minister . <p> And so when she married Elton , she did it without telling her family . She already knew their judgment of Elton : " He 's nothing . " She and Elton simply drove down to Hargrave one late October night , awakened a preacher , and got married , hoping that their marriage would be accepted as an accomplished fact . They were wrong . It was not acceptable , and it was never going to be . She no longer belonged in that house , her parents told her . She no longer belonged to that family . To them it would be as if she had never lived . <p> She was seventeen , she had attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now her life as it had been was ended . The day would come when she would know herself to be a woman of faith . Now she merely loved and trusted . Nobody as living then on Elton 's mother 's little farm on Cotman Ridge , not far from the town of Port William , where Elton had lived for a while when he was a child . They rented the place and moved in , having just enough money to pay for the new dish cabinet and the table and four chairs . Elton , as it happened , already owned a milk cow in addition to his team and a few tools . <p> It was a different world , a new world to her , that she came into then  --  a world of poverty and community . They were in a neighborhood of six households , counting their own , all within half a mile of one another . Besides themselves there were Braymer and Josie Hardy and their children ; Tom Hardy and his wife , also named Josie ; Walter and Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hample and their children ; and Uncle Isham and Aunt Frances Quail , who were Thelma Cotman and Daisy Hample 's parents . The two Josies , to save confusion , were called Josie Braymer and Josie Tom . Josie Tom was Walter Cotman 's sister . In the world that Mary Penn had given up , a place of far larger and richer farms , work was sometimes exchanged , but the families were conscious of themselves in a way that set them apart from one another . Here , in this new world , neighbors were always working together . " Many hands make light work , " Uncle Isham Quail loved to say , though his own old hands were no longer able to work much . <p> Some work only the men did together , like haying and harvesting the corn . Some work only the women did together : sewing or quilting or wallpapering or housecleaning ; and whenever the men worked together , the women would be together cooking . Some work the men and women did together : harvesting tobacco , or killing hogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community was an old one . The families had worked together a long time . They all knew what each was good at . When they worked together , not much needed to be explained . When they went down to the little weatherboarded church at Goforth on Sunday morning , they were glad to see one another , and had lots to say , though they had seen each other almost daily during the week . <p> This neighborhood opened to Mary and Elton , took them in with a warmth that answered her parents ' rejection . The men , without asking or being asked , included Elton in whatever they were doing . They told him when and where they needed him . They came to him when he needed them . He was an apt and able hand , and they were glad to have his help . He learned from them all , but liked best to work with Walter Cotman , who was a fine farmer . He and Walter were , up to a point , two of a kind ; they were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned mess , " Walter said , and he made none  --  and both loved the employment of their minds in their work . They were unlike in that Walter was satisfied within the boundaries of his little farm , and Elton could not have been . Nonetheless , Elton loved his growing understanding of Walter 's character and ways . Though he was a quiet man and gave neither instruction nor advice , Walter was Elton 's teacher , and Elton was consciously his student . <p> Once , when they had killed hogs and Elton and Mary had stayed at home to finish rendering their lard , the boiling fat had foamed up and begun to run over the sides of the kettle . Mary ran to the house and called Walter on the party line . <p> " Tell him to throw the fire to it , " Walter said . " Tell him to dip out some lard and throw it on the fire . " <p> Elton did so , unbelieving , but the fire flared , grew hotter , the foaming lard subsided in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-accusation into a grin . " Well , " he said , quoting one of Walter 's sayings in Walter 's voice , " it 's all in knowing how . " <p> Mary , who had more to learn than Elton , became a daughter to every woman in the community . She came knowing little , barely enough to begin , and they taught her much . Thelma , Daisy , and the two Josies taught her their ways of cooking , cleaning , and sewing ; they taught her to can , pickle , and preserve ; they taught her to do the women 's jobs in the hog-killing . They took her on their expeditions to one another 's houses to cook harvest meals or to houseclean or to gather corn from the fields and can it . One day they all walked down to Goforth , in the Katie 's Branch Valley , to do some wallpapering for Josie Tom 's mother . They had a good time papering two rooms , and Josie Tom 's mother fixed them a dinner of fried chicken , creamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler . <p> In cold weather they sat all afternoon in one another 's houses , quilting or sewing or embroidering . Josie Tom was the best at needlework . Everything she made was a wonder . From spring to fall , for a Christmas present for someone , she always embroidered a long cloth that began with the earliest flowers of spring and ended with the last flowers of fall . She drew the flowers on the cloth with a pencil , and worked them in with her needle and colored threads . She included the flowers of the woods and fields , the dooryards and gardens . She loved to point to the penciled outlines and name the flowers as if calling them up in their beauty into her imagination . " Look a there , " she would say . " I even put in a jimsonweed . " " And a bull thistle , " said Tom Hardy , who had his doubts about weeds and thistles , but was proud of her for leaving nothing out . <p> Josie Tom was a plump , pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in reach . Mary Penn loved her the best , perhaps , but she loved them all . They were only in their late thirties or early forties , but to Mary they seemed to belong to the ageless , eternal generation of mothers , unimaginably older and more experienced than herself . She called them Miss Josie , Miss Daisy , and Miss Thelma . They warmed and sheltered her . Sometimes she wanted to toss herself at them like a little girl to be hugged . <p> They were capable , unasking , generous , humorous women , and sometimes , among themselves , they were raucous and free , unlike the other women she had known . On their way home from picking blackberries one afternoon , they had to get through a new barbed-wire fence . Josie Tom held two wires apart while the other four gathered their skirts , leaned down , and straddled through . Josie Tom handed their filled buckets over . And then Josie Braymer held the wires apart , and Josie Tom , stooping through , hung the back of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " she said , and she began to laugh . <p> They all laughed , and nobody laughed more than Josie Tom , who was standing spraddled and stooped , helpless to move without tearing her dress . <p> " Josie Braymer , " she said , " are you going to just stand there or are you going to unhook me from this shitten fence ? " <p> And there on the ridgetop in the low sunlight they danced the dance of women laughing , bending and straightening , raising and lowering their hands , swaying and stepping with their heads back . <p> Daylight was full in the windows now . Mary made herself get up and extinguish the lamp on the table . The lamps all needed to be cleaned and trimmed and refilled , and she had planned to do that today . The whole house needed to be dusted and swept . And she had mending to do . She tied a scarf around her head , put on her coat , and went out . <p> Only day before yesterday it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the wildflowers were starting up in the leafless woods , and she found a yellow crocus in the yard . And then this dry and bitter wind had come , driving down from the north as if it were as long and wide as time , the sky as gray as if the sun had never shone . The wind went through her coat , pressed her fluttering skirt tight against her legs , tore at her scarf . It chilled her to the bone . She went first to the privy in a back corner of the yard , and then on to the henhouse , where she shelled corn for the hens and gave them fresh water . <p> On her way back to the house she stood a moment , looking off in the direction in which she knew Elton and Walter Cotman were plowing . By now they would have accepted even this day as it was ; by now they might have shed their jackets . Later they would go in and wash and sit down in Thelma 's warm kitchen for their dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while before going back again to work through the long afternoon . Though they were not far away , though she could see them in her mind 's eye , their day and hers seemed estranged , divided by great distance and long time . She was cold , and the wind 's insistence wearied her ; the wind was like a living creature , rearing and pressing against her so that she might have cried out to it in exasperation , " What do you want ? " <p> When she got back into the house , she was shivering , her teeth chattering . She unbuttoned her coat without taking it off , and sat down close to the stove . They heated only two rooms , the kitchen and the front room where they slept . The stove in the front room might be warmer , she thought , and she could sit in the rocking chair ; but having sat down she did not get up . She had much that she needed to be doing , she told herself . She ought at least to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to the lamps ; it always pleased her to have them clean . But she did not get up . The stove 's heat drove the cold out of her clothes , and gradually her shivering stopped . <p> They had had a hard time of it their first winter . They had no fuel , no food laid up for the winter . Elton had raised a crop , but no garden . He borrowed against the crop to buy a meat hog . He cut and hauled in firewood . He worked for wages to buy groceries , but the times were hard and he could not always find work . Sometimes their meals consisted of biscuits and a gravy made of lard and flour . <p> And yet they were often happy . Often the world afforded them something to laugh about . Elton stayed alert for anything that was funny , and brought the stories home . He told her how the tickle-ass grass got into Uncle Isham 's pants , and how Daisy Hample clucked to her nearsighted husband and children like a hem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , walked off the edge of Braymer Hardy 's front porch , fell into a rosebush , and said , " Now , I did n't go to do that ! " Elton was a natural mimic , and he could make the funny things happen again in the dark as they lay in bed at night ; sometimes they would laugh until their eyes were wet with tears . When they got snowed in that winter , they would drive the old car down the hill until it stalled in the drifts , and drag it out with the team , and ram it into the drifts , again , laughing until the the horses looked at them in wonder . <p> When the next year came , they began at the beginning , and though the times had not improved , they improved themselves . They bought a few hens and a rooster from Josie Braymer . They bought a second cow . They put in a garden . They bought two shoats to raise for meat . Mary learned to preserve the food they would need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . She took a small bucket of cream and a few eggs to Port William every Saturday night , and used the money she made to buy groceries and to pay on their debts . <p> Slowly she learned to imagine where she was . The ridge named for Walter Cotman 's family was a long one , curving out toward the river between the two creek valleys of Willow Run and Katie 's Branch . As it came near to the river valley it got narrower , its sides steeper and more deeply incised by hollows . When Elton and Mary Penn were making their beginning there , the uplands were divided into many farms , few of which contained as much as a hundred acres . The hollows , the steeper hillsides , the bluffs along the sides of the two creek valleys , were covered with thicket or woods . From where the hawks saw it , the ridge would have seemed a long , irregular promontory reaching out into a sea of trees . And it bore on its back crisscrossings of other trees along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groves , trees in the house yards . And on rises of ground , or tucked into folds , were the gray , paintless buildings of the farmsteads , connected to one another by lanes and paths . Now she thought of herself as belonging there , not just because of her marriage to Elton but also because of the economy that the two of them had made around themselves and with their neighbors . She had learned to think of herself as living and working at the center of a wonderful provisioning : the kitchen and garden , hogpen and smokehouse , hen house and cellar , of her own household ; the little commerce of giving and taking that spoked out along the paths connecting her household to the others ; Port William on its ridgetop in one direction , Goforth in its valley in the other ; and all this at the heart of the weather and the world . <p> On a bright , still day in the late fall , after all the leaves were down , she had stood on the highest point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight up into the wide down-falling light . She knew which smoke came from which house . It was like watching the rising up of prayers , or some less acknowledged communication between Earth and Heaven . She could not say to herself how it made her feel . <p> She loved her jars of vegetables and preserves on the cellar shelves , and the potato bin beneath , the cured hams and shoulders and bacons hanging in the smokehouse , the two hens already brooding their clutches of marked eggs , the egg basket and the cream bucket slowly filling , week after week . But today these things seemed both dear and far away , as if remembered from another world or another life . Her sickness made things seem all awry and arbitrary . Nothing had to be the way it was . As easily as she could imagine the house in its completeness , she could imagine it empty , windowless , the tin roof blowing away , the chimneys crumbling , the cellar caved in , weeds in the yard . She could imagine Elton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hample , Cotman , and Quail  --  gone too . <p> Elton could spend an hour telling her  --  and himself  --  how Walter Cotman went about his work . Elton was a man fascinated with farming , and she could see him picking his way into it with his understanding . He wanted to see how a way of doing came out of a way of thinking and a way of living . He was interested in the ways people talked and wore their clothes . <p> The Hamples were another of his studies . Jonah Hample and his young ones were almost useless as farmers , because , Elton maintained , they could not see all the way to the ground . They did not own a car , because they could not see well enough to drive  --  " They need to drive something with eyes , " Elton said  --  and yet they were all born mechanics . They could fix anything . While Daisy Hample stood on the porch clucking about the weeds in their crops , Jonah and his boys , and sometimes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somebody had brought them to fix . The Hample children went about the neighborhood in a drove , pushing a fairly usable old bicycle that they loved but could not ride . <p> Elton watched Braymer , too . Unlike his brother and Walter Cotman , Braymer liked to know what was going on in the world . Like the rest of them , Braymer had no cash to spare , but he liked to think about what he would do with money if he had it . He liked knowing where something could be bought for a good price . He liked to hear what somebody had done to make a little money , and then to think about it and tell the others about it while they worked . " Braymer would be a trader if he had a chance , " Elton told Mary . " He 'd like to try a little of this and a little of that , and see how he did with it . Walter and Tom like what they 've got . " <p> " And you do n't like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned big at her , as he always did when she read his mind . " I like some of it , " he said . <p> At the end of the summer , when she and Elton were beginning their first tobacco harvest in the neighborhood , Tom Hardy said to Elton , " Now , Josie Braymer can outcut us all , Elton . If she gets ahead of you , just do n't pay it any mind . " <p> " Tom , " Elton said , " I 'm going to leave here now and go to the other end of this row . If Josie Braymer gets there before I do , I 'm going home . " <p> When he got to the end of the row , Josie Braymer was not there , and neither were any of the men . It was not that he did not want to be bested by a woman ; he did not want to be bested by anybody . One thing Mary would never have to do was wonder which way he was . She knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the best way to be , she thought , but it was the way he was , and she loved him . It was both a trouble and a comfort to her to know that he would always require the most of himself . It stirred her . <p> She could feel ambition constantly pressing in him . He could do more than he had done  --  he knew he could  --  and he was always looking for the way . He was like an ax-man at work in a tangled thicker , cutting and cutting at the little brush and the vines and the low limbs , trying to make room for a full swing . For this year he had rented corn ground from Josie Tom 's mother , down by Goforth , two miles away . When he went down with his team to work , he would have to take his dinner . It would mean more work for them both , but he was desperate for room to exert himself . In two years , after the death of Josie Tom 's mother , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another two years they would move to the Jack Beechum place , a good , well-husbanded farm that would give them their chance . They foresaw none of that now . They were poor as the times , and they saw more obstacles than openings . And yet she believed without doubt that Elton was on his way . <p> It was not his ambition  --  his constant , tireless , often exhilarated preoccupation with work  --  that troubled her . She could stay with him in that . She had learned that she could do , and do well and gladly enough , whatever she would have to do . She had no fear . What troubled her were the dark and mostly silent angers that often settled on him and estranged him from everything . At those times , she knew , he doubted himself , and he suffered and raged in his doubt . He may have been born with this doubt in him , she sometimes imagined ; it was as though his soul were like a little moon that would be dark at times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' rejection of him had cost him dearly . Even as he defied them to matter to him , they held a power over him that he could not shake off . In his inability to forgive them , he consented to their power over him , and their rejection stood by him and measured him day by day . Her parents ' pride was social , belonging , even in its extremity , to their kind and time . But Elton 's pride was creaturely , howbeit that of an extraordinary creature ; it was a creature 's naked claim on the right to respect itself , a claim that no creature 's life could of itself invariably support . At times he seemed to her a man in the light in daily struggle with a man in the dark , and sometimes the man in the dark had the upper hand . <p> Elton never felt that nay mistake was affordable ; he and Mary were living within margins that were too narrow . He required perfection of himself . When he failed , he was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his doubt , furious at her because of her trust in him in spite of his doubt . How could she dare to love him , a man who did not love himself ? And then , sometimes accountably , sometimes not , the cloud would move away , and he would light up everything around him . His own force and intelligence would be clear within him then ; he would be skillful and joyful , passionate in his love of order , funny and tender . <p> At his best , Elton was a man in love  --  with her , but not just with her . He was in love , too , with the world , with their place in the world , with even that scanty farm , with his own life , with farming . At those times she lived in his love as in a spacious house . <p> Walter Cotman always spoke of Mary as Elton 's " better half . " In spite of his sulks and silences , she would not go so far as " better . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needed her . At times she knew with a joyous ache that she completed him , just as she knew with the same joy that she needed him and he completed her . How beautiful a thing it was , she sought , to be a half , to be completed by such another half ! When had there ever been such a yearning of halves toward each other , such a longing , even in quarrels , to be whole ? And sometimes they would be whole . Their wholeness came upon them like a rush of light , around them and within them , so that she felt they must be shining in the dark . <p> But now that wholeness was not imaginable ; she felt herself a part without counterpart , a mere fragment of something unknown , dark and broken off . The fire had burned low in the stove . Though she still wore her coat , she was chilled again and shaking . For a long time , perhaps , she had been thinking of nothing , and now misery alerted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the house 's corners . She could hear its billows and shocks , as if somebody off in the distance were shaking a great rug . It was like something that somebody was doing . She felt not a draft but the whole atmosphere of the room moving coldly against her . She went into the other room , but the fire there also needed building up . She could not bring herself to do it . She was shaking , she ached , she could think only of lying down . Standing near the stove , she undressed , put on her nightgown again , and went to bed . <p> She lay chattering and shivering while the bedclothes warmed around her . She sensed that the time might come when sickness would be a great blessing , for she truly did not care if she died . She thought of Elton , who could not even look at her , out of the day 's wind that had caught him up , and see that she was sick . If she had not been so miserable , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip away , like dishes sliding along a table pitched as steeply as a roof . She went to sleep . <p> When she woke , the room was warm . A tea kettle on the heating stove was muttering and steaming . Though the wind was still blowing hard , the room was full of sunlight . The lamp on the narrow mantelshelf behind the stove was filled and clean , its chimney gleaming , and so was the one on the stand by the bed . Josie Tom was sitting in the rocker by the window , sunlight flowing in on the unfinished long embroidery she had draped over her lap . She was bowed over her work , filling in with her needle and a length of yellow thread the bright corolla of a jonquil  --  or " Easter lily , " as she would have called it . She was humming the tune of an old hymn , something she often did while she was working , apparently without awareness that she was doing it . Her voice was resonant , low , and quiet , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and Josie Tom also were merely listening to it . The yellow flower was nearly complete . <p> And so Mary knew all the story of her day . Elton , going by Josie Tom 's in the half light , had stopped and called . <p> She could hear his voice , raised to carry through the wind : " Mrs. Hardy , Mary 's sick , and I have to go over to Walter 's to plow . " <p> So he had known . He had thought of her . He had told Josie Tom . <p> Feeling herself looked at , Josie Tom raised her head and smiled . " Well , are you awake ? Are you all right ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm wonderful , " Mary said . And she slept again . <p>
