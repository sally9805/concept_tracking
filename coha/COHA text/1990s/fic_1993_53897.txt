<p> BY ANY MEASURE , EXCEPT GOD 'S , Cyrus Packer 's only success in life was the consistency of his failure . Even his face betrayed him . Past forty , he looked sixty . A widower for ten years , he had never owned a thing except his hard luck , his anger at it , and now the beef farm in Beulah , western Virginia , that he was about to lose . One hundred thirty acres , less than half in timber , bought with the settlement after the car crash in Staunton that killed his wife  --  bad luck is contagious  --  ten percent down , the balance over thirty years . The only question left to answer was whether the farm would run him into the ground before he ran it . And either way , not whether but when . <p> He was a former merchant seaman , a former carpenter , a former house painter , a former plumber 's helper , a former drunk , a former maintenance man on the C and O railroad . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , legs spotted with veins like a bas-relief of the Chinese Wall , and a shuffling gait from walking track . His long neck tipped forward as though braced against a perpetual wind . <p> His anger took different shapes . Sometimes it was what you felt when you woke in a strange town and discovered the whore you took to bed last night is now your wife . Sometimes it was a land mine left from a previous war ; any false move could set it off . Sometimes it flashed like summer lightning followed by a storm , or more likely followed by nothing . <p> He had no patent on hard luck , but if it had been money he would have been on Easy Street . When his cows were quarantined with brucellosis he was already six months behind in his bank payments . Two months earlier he had listed the farm with a real estate agent who said he could get one hundred fifty thousand . Cyrus did n't believe . him . " They always lie about what they can do , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one twenty I paid . " The agent peppered Cyrus 's pastures with For Sale signs that had not even attracted a looker . <p> Putting the farm on the market eased the pressure from the bank , but they were fast running out of patience . So as soon as word was out that Clay Dixon was looking for land , Cyrus decided he better start dancing even if he did n't like the tune ( screw the real estate agent , who had n't done thing one since he put up his signs ) . Most folks would n't talk to Dixon , even those who needed to sell , because it was an article of his faith never to offer what anything was worth  --  but even a Dixon price was better than what the bank would do . <p> Each morning for more than a week Cyrus waited until his teenage stepdaughter , Marlene , left to meet the school bus before he shaved , changed into fresh pants and a clean shirt , and prepared to drive his pickup from Beulah to Sterlings Draft to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the end even he ran out of excuses . <p> At the Kayo gas station south of Sterlings Draft  --  one of Dixon 's businesses  --  a young man in a grease-stained undershirt directed Cyrus to the Old Dominion Auto Exchange , another Dixon business . " That 's where he generally hangs out . " <p> Red , green , and blue plastic pennants were strung above a neat row of used cars . Cyrus stopped to lean out the window of his pickup and yell at a middle-aged man wearing a cowboy hat and smoking a cigar in a plastic holder . <p> " Clay Dixon here ? " <p> " You got him . " <p> Dixon was a big man with a deep chest , short arms , and ham hands . His eyes were round and deep . Stone bald head , with a fringe of colorless hair above his ears . Mouth wide , vise-like lips , his teeth the color of fresh tanned leather . A hula dancer in a grass skirt was tattooed to the inside of his right forearm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Heard you were looking for a farm , " Cyrus said . Be damned if he would beat around the bush . <p> Dixon pinched the cigar butt from its plastic holder and ground it under his heel . Then he reached into his shirt pocket for a fresh cigar , stripped the cellophane , bit off the end , and turned his head to spit . " Already own four of them , " he said . He struck a match , waited for it to flare , then drew half a dozen times . " What do I want with another ? " <p> Cyrus felt his anger rise and fought to keep it down . Damned fool thinks I was born this morning . " Must have heard wrong , " he said , and turned to leave . <p> Dixon put out an arm as if to grab Cyrus . " Hell , Mister , you come this far  --  " <p> That 's better , Cyrus thought . But still he had to fight to control his voice . " Got a hundred thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dixon puffed his cigar . " Did n't catch the name , " he finally said . <p> " Packer . Cyrus Packer . " <p> " Packer . " Dixon said it so loud that folks across the street turned to look . " From Beulah . Sure . Bought the Longworth place after the old man died . Remember like it was yesterday . " Dixon tipped his hat forward and shaded his eyes . " Why you looking to sell ? " <p> Cyrus shifted his feet and raised a small cloud of dust . " Had a run of bad luck , " he said . <p> He watched Dixon wipe the corners of his mouth with thumb and forefinger . In addition to the Old Dominion Auto Exchange , the Kayo gas station , and the four farms in two counties , he owned the Spee-dee Laundromat , the Dairy Queen , the Silver Screen drive-in movie , and was a director of the Rockford County State Bank . Other folks ' bad luck was his specialty . <p> " I suppose it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your best hope is a man like Dixon , Cyrus thought , you already got more trouble than you need . <p> At home he eased his mind by sitting on the porch with his feet against the stiles , a six-pack of High Life beside his chair . He was working on his third beer when Marlene appeared at the end of the drive and started the long walk from the state road to the house . <p> She stopped below the porch and looked up at him . " What are we celebrating ? " <p> " Clay Dixon , " he said . " Went to see him in Sterlings Draft . " <p> " And ? " <p> " He wants to buy the place . If it 's cheap enough . " <p> She stared him down and gave no hint what she was thinking . <p> " The farm was a mistake is all , " he said . He stripped sweat from his High Life and let it run off his index finger . " Dixon says he 'll be out as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies the county plat , " Marlene said . " And after he checks how far you 're behind at the bank , where he just happens to be a director . " <p> She was her mother 's baby from her first marriage . Seventeen now , a senior at Rockford County Central High , and a mystery to Cyrus . She had her mama 's halo of naturally curly dark-blond hair and her mama 's sharp breasts , but from there out she was her own creation . Delicate . face , thin and bony , flat hips that flowed right and left as she walked . Eyes clear and bright . Legs still a size too long , but she would grow into them . <p> He caught himself staring at her and quickly looked away . The change from child to woman had come so suddenly it still caught him by surprise . One week she 's a flat-chested gawky kid with knobby knees and elbows , he told himself , then I blink my eyes and there 's a damned revolution . Ca n't even look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She climbed to the porch , watched him finish one beer and reach for the next . " How do you get the top to snap off with just your thumb ? " she asked for the fiftieth time . <p> " Practice , " he answered , as he always did . <p> For five years after his wife died Cyrus took care of Marlene . Then he stopped , more because she did n't seem to require anything he could offer than because he lost interest , and she started taking care of him . She did the cooking , the washing and ironing , kept the house , did the sewing . She even made curtains when she got tired of looking through bare glass . She planted flowers in front of the house : daffodils , iris , hydrangea , beds of pansies , and a wisteria she beat back every spring . Her melons from the garden Cyrus plowed behind the house won Honorable Mention at the county fair three years running . For the past year she had been working weekends at McDonald 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up . <p> The week after Cyrus talked to Dixon the weather stayed hot and dry , the way it does in September , the world old and lifeless , leaves barely hanging on , the sky a pale gray-blue . The only person who showed up was the county agent , a small square man with a few strands of gray hair slicked across his head , a long jaw , and false teeth that clacked when he talked too fast . After he checked the cows to be sure Cyrus was n't breaking quarantine , he and Cyrus walked back to the house . " Heard you went to see Clay Dixon , " he said . <p> " A man could get rich by minding his own damned business , " Cyrus answered . They stopped below the porch that stretched from the front of the house to the kitchen . " Marlene made a pitcher of ice tea , " Cyrus said because he regretted taking after the agent . <p> " Nice girl , " the agent said . " Sensible . " <p> Cyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . <p> " No offense , but you want to watch out for Clay Dixon , " the agent said . " He got a name for getting his way with the ladies and for being sharp in business . " The agent gulped the tea and handed the glass to Cyrus . " Been married four times I know of . Be better if you could find another buyer , " he said . <p> " I 'm lucky there 's no one bidding against me to sell , " Cyrus said . <p> The following day the weather broke and Dixon called to say he was coming . But it was late afternoon  --  after Cyrus had almost given up hope  --  before Dixon steered his pickup down the dip in the drive and climbed to the square white house . Cyrus jumped to his feet and waited on the porch . Marlene joined him after she stripped off her apron and tried to rinse away the red stain on her fingers from peeling beets . <p> Dixon pulled beside the carriage barn and stepped from the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile . <p> " What can I show you first ? " Cyrus asked . <p> " Stop acting anxious , " Marlene whispered . <p> " A glass of water , " Dixon said . <p> " There 's fresh ice tea , " Marlene said , too quickly . <p> Dixon removed his cowboy hat , ran a hand over his head , and examined Marlene . " That would be just fine , " he said . <p> She touched her hair , backed away , and the two men followed her . <p> " We could walk the line , " Cyrus suggested . <p> Dixon set his cigar on the edge of the chipped white kitchen table . " Walked it before I come . " He paused to drink tea . " How much you asking ? " <p> " One twenty , " Cyrus said . <p> Dixon laughed . <p> Cyrus felt the back of his neck grow hot . <p> " On its best day the place ai n't worth more than fifty , " Dixon said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty . " <p> " Paid twice that , " Cyrus said . His lips barely moved when he spoke . <p> " Then do n't sell , " Dixon said . He drank more tea , smacked his lips , and picked up his cigar . " Or look for another buyer . Someone who do n't know what land is worth . " He set the glass on the table . " You come to me , " he said . " I did n't come to you . " <p> As soon as Dixon left , Cyrus dropped into a kitchen chair . " Thinks he got me by the short hair . " He slammed his fist on the enamel table , then ran the back of his hand across the stubble on his chin . " Real nice , " he said . " Real nice . After the . dust settles I still owe the bank almost twenty-five thousand , Dixon has my farm , and I got the short end of the stick again . " <p> Marlene moved the beets from a colander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried them to the stove . " Sixty thousand was n't his final offer , " she said . <p> Cyrus continued his own conversation . " I knew the son of a bitch would try to cheat me . " <p> Marlene continued hers . " Tell him you want to talk some more . " <p> " Just did n't know how bad . " <p> After supper , while it was still light , he walked outside to vent his fury . All the walking did was feed the anger that boiled his blood . By the time he returned to the house Marlene had gone to sleep . Cyrus felt like he was about to explode , that Marlene would find pieces of him all over the house . <p> " What I need is a drink , " he announced . He could feel the weight of a fifth of Virginia Gentleman in his fingers , saw the deep amber color in a glass . " With a touch of water to smooth the burn until the glow begins . " The thought calmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No big deal . Not as long as I climb back on . " <p> He paced his room , inventing what he would say to Dixon , what he should have said . When the room became too small he paced the house . " You got to deal with the son of a bitch , " he said . Then wondered which son of a bitch he meant . <p> The following day he was at the ABC store in Sterlings Draft when it opened . Driving home , his fingers rested on the bottle to keep it from rolling when he hit a curve . In his kitchen he poured two fingers , added a touch of water , and held it up to the light to admire its color before he drank . Then he hid the bottle behind the iron skillets under the sink ( so it would n't look like he was hiding it if Marlene found it ) , but dug it out and poured two fingers more . " Might as well get hung for a thief as for a bandit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the first , so he fixed a third . It took a fourth before he started to feel a glow . He poured another before he realized the fourth was gone . " Not too much , " he warned himself . " Just enough to ease the pain . " He drained the glass , rinsed it , set it beside the sink , and admired his restraint . <p> When he looked at the clock over the kitchen table , the morning had disappeared and it was midway into the afternoon . He sat on the porch , chair tipped back , and waited for Marlene . His chin dropped to his chest , and by the time she arrived he had forgotten why he needed the bourbon . <p> She reminded him . " You talk to Mister Dixon ? " <p> He turned his head so she would n't smell his breath . " Got nothing to say . " <p> " You been drinking ? " she demanded . <p> " Of course not . " <p> She edged around him and leaned forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't my wife . " He spat the words , as though he was n't sure he was right . <p> " Or one of your sleazy girlfriends , " she fired back . " I 'm not fat Elsie , or Dora with her pimples , or Annette who may be bald  --  " <p> " Get off  --  " <p> " Under that dime-store wig . " <p> " My back . " <p> She shook her head . " You swore you would n't get drunk no more . " <p> " Had two . That 's all . " <p> " Like you swore we would n't have to move until after I graduate . " <p> " We ai n't moved yet . " <p> " Except to the poorhouse . " With her fist she brushed back the tears that welled in her eyes . <p> An ancient white four-door Lincoln convertible with the top down turned into the driveway . Cyrus shielded his eyes , grateful for the interruption . " Who the hell is that ? " he said . Marlene ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he recognized Dixon behind the wheel . " More good news , " Cyrus complained . " Just what I needed . " <p> Dixon drove past the house , kept the motor running , and pressed a button for the trunk to open automatically from the top . The white canvas roof unfolded and slid into place , then the trunk closed . Dixon clipped the roof shut , stood beside the car , and wiped a spot of dust off the hood with the palm of his hand . <p> " Just happened to be driving past , " Dixon said . <p> Cyrus nodded . And I 'm the damned tooth fairy . <p> Dixon climbed the wooden steps to the porch , took off his hat , mopped his forehead with his arm , and sat in a metal chair that bent beneath his weight . " You thought about my offer ? " he asked . <p> Cyrus braced himself against the porch rail . " What offer ? " <p> " The sixt  --  " Dixon broke off and laughed . <p> Marlene stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheese , Ritz crackers , and a single glass of whiskey that was obviously meant for Dixon . She squinted into the afternoon sun and looked past her stepfather like he was a piece of furniture . He accepted his punishment without comment . " Is that the car where the top goes in the trunk ? " she asked Dixon . <p> " Man traded it the other day . Said it gets five gallons to the mile , " Dixon said . " Far as I can tell it never met a gas pump it did n't like . " He stirred the whiskey with his finger . <p> Marlene pulled a chair across the porch and sat opposite the two men . She had changed into a checkered dress that was cut above her knees and square across her chest . She swung one leg over the other and showed most of her thigh . " Help yourself to hors d'oeuvres , " she said . <p> Dixon cut a slab of cheese and passed the tray to Cyrus , who set it on the deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress when she leaned forward to take a cracker . Cyrus hated it when she did things that made men notice her , and hated it worse when she did and they did n't . She was n't a virgin , he knew that because he had found the birth control pills , but he could n't picture her not being one . Half the time he was glad she was n't , the other half he was almost ashamed . Not of her but of himself . All the time he was curious . <p> When she was twelve he had borrowed a book , Modern Puberty , from the county library , and studied it at night after she had gone to bed . <p> " We need to have a talk , " he said one night at supper and filled his mouth with food because he could n't think how to begin . <p> She made an effort to look interested . <p> " About you becoming a woman , " he finally said . <p> " You mean about my period ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " she said . <p> " Good , " he said , shoveled more food into his mouth , and breathed a deep sigh . Now came the hard part . " People get excited , " he said . " Boys and girls . They do things they regret later . " <p> " What things ? " <p> " Things . " With his fork he searched his plate for more food . " For boys to respect you , you have to respect yourself . " It was straight out the book and he had memorized it . " Boys are going to put the same value on your body that you do . " <p> " That 's what Miss Davis said . " <p> " That 's all I have to say . " He pushed his plate to the center of the table and scraped back his chair . <p> A faint smile dusted her lips . <p> " What 's funny ? " he asked . <p> " Nothing . " <p> Dixon put his whiskey beside his chair , fitted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match on the bottom of his chair . " Talked to the folks at the bank , " he said . " They 're getting antsy about you . " <p> Cyrus waited , thinking , if the son of a bitch is going to raise his bid , why do n't he just do it ? <p> Dixon threw away the match , struck another , and puffed his cigar to get it going good . " I told them we were dickering . " He examined the glowing tip and leaned forward in his chair . " We both got things to do , " he said , " so I 'm going to give you my final offer and we can get off the dime . " <p> Cyrus folded his arms across his chest . <p> " Seventy-five , " Dixon said . The chair sank as he leaned back . " Take it or leave it . " <p> Cyrus 's arms unfolded and he gripped the railing . " You trying to low-ball me ? " he said , his voice too loud . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to pay more ? " <p> " If I did would I be talking to you ? " <p> " What do you figure you owe the bank ? " Dixon asked . <p> " You know damn well what I owe , " Cyrus said . <p> He watched Marlene look from Dixon to him and back again . <p> " The money I pay ai n't the whole nine yards , " Dixon said . " You could still end up with cash in your pocket . " <p> Cyrus continued to watch Marlene . She looks like she already jumped ship and is swimming for shore , he thought . <p> " There 's livestock and equipment , " Dixon continued , then held up a hand as if Cyrus meant to interrupt . " Get that auctioneer , what's-his-name , Ferris Bull . Hold a sale . " <p> Marlene nodded . <p> Cyrus felt an infinite sadness settle on his shoulders . It moved past his chest and took up residence inside his stomach . All he had ever asked was Marlene 's respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Cyrus did n't hear , then pointed his cigar at Marlene . " How old are you ? " <p> " Seventeen , " Cyrus said . <p> Dixon ignored Cyrus . " You want a job ? " he asked . <p> " She got a job , " Cyrus said . <p> " A nice-looking girl like you would be good for business , " Dixon said . <p> " Works weekends at McDonald 's , " Cyrus said . <p> Dixon slid forward in his chair , pulled himself to his feet , and finally spoke to Cyrus . " You think Mister McDonald cares if she lives or dies ? I treat my people right . " <p> Marlene walked beside Dixon to his car . Cyrus tagged behind . <p> " Let me see the roof go in the trunk , " she said . <p> " Hop in , " Dixon said . " I 'll give you a ride . " <p> She looked to Cyrus for permission . <p> " Take a jacket , " he said , grateful she had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes down , " he added . She ran back to the house . <p> Dixon started the car and spoke above the low-pitched roar of the engine . " Frankly , it do n't matter to me if I buy from you or from the bank . I 'm just trying to help you out . " <p> By screwing me , Cyrus thought . And you want me to help you do it . <p> Marlene jumped into the car and knelt on the front seat to see the trunk open , swallow the canvas top . Then she sat beside Dixon as he drove off . <p> Cyrus felt that he had lost something and could spend years trying to get it back . He returned to the house , found the bourbon , and brought it to the porch . A colony of ants was working on the cheese and crackers . He brushed them away . <p> The sun behind the mountain cast the farm in a gentle glow but did n't hide that the barn roof needed to be patched , that fences needed repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do either , and that ironweed and cypress trees were sprouting like armed sentinels in his pastures . <p> In the field beyond the state road he could hear his cows . " I hold a sale wo n't nobody give me what they 're worth , " he said aloud . " Knowing whose they are . " He paused to drink . " A bunch of goddamned thieves , " he said . <p> " Equipment is a joke , " he continued . " Half the time the baler wo n't bale , bush hog got a busted blade , corn planter do n't work . Lucky the tractor ai n't locked up . " <p> He started on the hard luck that had dogged him like imps from hell . The spring he put in alfalfa and watched the seed run off in a thunderstorm . Or the bull stepping in a groundhog hole and breaking a leg . The year it did n't rain and his corn dried on the stalk . Then the next year when the rain would n't quit and the corn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy , dead in the driveway , poisoned . <p> He raised his glass and drank to Dixon and his whole nine yards . Poured more whiskey and drank to Marlene . Getting ready to leave the nest . Sooner or later it had to happen , he told himself . Ai n't her fault . <p> " Shit on your seventy-five , " he said to Dixon . " The farm ought to bring one fifty , like the agent said . " He drained his glass and poured another . <p> The last light faded and stars appeared in the clear black sky , a few at a time , then whole bunches . A curved blade of moon rose above a low hill . His shoulders twitched and he felt a chill run down his spine . " Ought to go inside , " he said . " Good thing I got Marlene to take a jacket . " <p> The car 's headlights woke him . His eyes opened , then sealed themselves against the glare . His hands gripped the metal arms of the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . <p> A voice that could have been Marlene 's said , " C.P. ? Are you awake ? " He opened his mouth and mumbled a snore . Another voice , a man 's , " He 's drunk . " Then the woman , " Damn . " And the man , " I 'll help you . " <p> Hands lifted Cyrus from the chair . He shook them off , said something even he could n't understand , and rubber-legged into the screen door . " Hold him while I get it open , " someone said . His feet moved solidly on the stairs , missed a step , then moved again , dragged upward by the hands that refused to leave his shoulders . If he could make it to the upstairs hall  --  the thought refused to complete itself . Then his spine recognized the lumps in his mattress . Fingers unlaced his boots and loosened his belt . He sighed , but when he closed his eyes the room turned hard to starboard . " Half-speed ahead , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed gleamed with phosphorus as his bed came to a full stop . <p> Sheets of rain against the metal roof woke him . He knew it was late and refused to look at the clock beside his bed lest it tell him more bad news than he could handle . The pain deep behind his eyes spread equally in all directions . His stomach worked with each breath , then gathered to a bilious knot when he swung his feet to the floor and waited for the nausea to subside . Rain pounded through an open window . He tried to shut it but his finger slid off the frame . " To hell with it , " he muttered . <p> Very carefully he made his way downstairs . Marlene sat in her bathrobe at the kitchen table , a mug of coffee between her hands . <p> " Morning after , " he said . He made it to the kitchen table and dropped into a chair . <p> She nodded and sat for a moment longer before she moved to the stove . " You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left whiskey around a former drunk , " he said . <p> " I did n't bring it in the house . " <p> " I need a drink to join the human race , " he announced . <p> " Coffee , " she said . She filled a mug , set it in front of him , and returned to the stove . " And something to eat . " <p> " You were late last night , " he said into the cup . <p> " How would you know ? " she asked . <p> He could n't figure out an answer so he changed the subject . " Why are n't you in school ? " <p> " Saturday , " she said . <p> " Where did you and Dixon go ? " <p> " Sterlings Draft . He wanted to show off his businesses . " She broke two eggs into an iron skillet . " How about some meat ? " <p> He shook his head . <p> " Mister Dixon said he 'd pay me more than I make at McDonald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when he closes it for the winter he said I could have a job at the Dairy Queen . Mister Dixon said I got management potential . " <p> He marveled how quickly he became sick of hearing Dixon 's name . <p> She flipped the eggs and reached into a cabinet for a plate . " Later we stopped at his house so he could show me where he 's building a swimming pool and we had a couple of drinks . " <p> " In his house ? " <p> " Of course . " She put the eggs in front of him and turned back to the stove . <p> " Was he trying to get you drunk ? " <p> " Two drinks was all I had , " she said . <p> " I heard that before . " <p> " The man offered me  --  " <p> " He do n't offer nothing , " Cyrus snapped . " He buys and he sells . " For a moment he thought he would vomit into his plate . <p> " A job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cyrus said . " Got more women  --  " <p> " Everybody knows about him and his wives , " she said . <p> Cyrus gripped the table with both hands . Greasy sweat beaded his forehead . " Than Carter got pills . " He saw Dixon 's face through a cloud of cigar smoke , saw his hand reaching toward Marlene . <p> Cyrus shook his head . It ai n't her fault , he told himself . Then his anger suddenly exploded . " I ai n't mad at you , " he yelled . " I blame myself . " <p> She looked like she did n't believe him . <p> " I should have known something would happen when you drove off with him . " <p> " It was n't like that , " she protested . <p> " What was it like ? " Then he shook his head again . <p> " Nothing happened . " <p> He could n't afford to believe her . He slammed his fist onto the table and the plate jumped . " If he put one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he shouted . <p> " Statutory . " <p> " And it do n't matter that you were willing . You 're seventeen and that 's the law . " <p> " I was n't willing . " <p> " Makes it worse . " <p> Marlene moved to the sink . " He 's old enough to be my father , " she said . <p> " So am I , " he said , and wondered what he meant . <p> He rose unsteadily to his feet and hunched over the table , his weight on both arms , then seemed to pull himself together . He stopped thinking about Marlene and concentrated on Dixon . " This time I got him by the short hair . " <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> " Never mind . " <p> He was n't sure what he believed , but he knew what he had to do . Twice he saw his face in the rearview mirror . The veins in his eyes looked like a road map . of hell . But through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Sterlings Draft before he saw the pickup and the Lincoln Continental parked side by side behind a row of silver poplars in front of Dixon 's house . <p> Cyrus hit the curve at the end of the drive too fast and raised a volley of blue stones . He slowed , almost stopped , then reached back for his deer rifle in the rack behind his seat and eased down the drive . When he stopped he found a full clip in the glove box and jammed it home . <p> A warm wind whipped his face ; rain soaked through his shirt and drowned his boots . He walked around the Lincoln , measuring it for size . Then , without really aiming , he shot out its tires . <p> That ought to get his attention , Cyrus thought . <p> The kitchen door slammed and Dixon strode onto the porch . " What the hell ? " His shirt was unbuttoned and flapped in the wind . He pulled the cigar from between his teeth and used it as a pointer . Behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her dress together . <p> What I expected , Cyrus thought . He swung the gun toward Dixon , who backed away . The woman disappeared . <p> " Do n't do anything stupid , " Dixon said , and continued to move back . <p> Cyrus shuffled through the wet grass . " You raped my daughter . " He raised the rifle to his shoulder . <p> " I what ? " <p> " You heard me . " <p> " I offered her a job is what I did . " Dixon said . His back was against the screen door , his hands half-raised . <p> " You got her drunk . " <p> " We had a couple of drinks . I admit that . But was n't nobody drunk . " <p> " That 's when it happened , " Cyrus said . He sighted the rifle to a spot between Dixon 's eyes . " It do n't matter that being drunk made her willing because she 's seventeen . " <p> Dixon 's hands crawled higher . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice harsh , like the sound of an adding machine . <p> " I say you did . " Cyrus flicked the safety on the rifle . <p> " And I say you 're lying , " Dixon said . <p> " Our word against yours , " Cyrus said . " Why do n't I go to Sheriff Klock , swear out a warrant , and we see who 's right ? " <p> " A warrant for what ? " Dixon asked . <p> " Stationary rape . " <p> " I swear to God , " Dixon said , " I never touched the girl . " <p> " She says you did . " <p> " This some kind of setup ? " Dixon said . " You and the girl cook it up together ? " He started to lower his arms , then thought better . " Try to help somebody and this is what you get . " <p> " All I want is . justice , " Cyrus said . Water ran from the brim of his hat onto his back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then nodded left and right confirming it . He pulled his shirt together and buttoned the top two buttons . " I 'm a businessman , so I 'm offering you a business proposition . " He tucked the ends of his shirt into his pants . " You drop the rape charge and I agree to buy the farm for ninety thousand . Nothing fairer than that . " <p> " One twenty , " Cyrus said . " Or I go to Klock . " <p> " I 'll go as high as a hundred . " <p> " You deaf or something ? " Cyrus said . <p> " I do n't like being pushed . " <p> " Neither do I , " Cyrus said . <p> " One ten , " Dixon said . " Take it or leave it . " <p> Cyrus turned away . <p> " All right , damn you , " Dixon barked . " One twenty . But you throw in the livestock and equipment . " <p> Cyrus nodded . " One thing , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But you got to pay me rent . " <p> They shook on it , and the hula girl on Dixon 's forearm went into her dance . <p> The rain stopped halfway back to Beulah and a hot sun appeared behind the edge of ragged clouds . The highway steamed under the sudden heat . Cyrus 's hands shook so bad he had to pull to the side of the road and stop . Cars screamed past him , making the rising and descending noise of speed . " The son of a bitch had no right , " he said aloud . When the shaking finally stopped , he pulled back onto the highway without looking . A car swerved around him . An angry woman shook her fist and yelled something he could n't hear . <p> Marlene was on the porch , a bottle of Dr Pepper in her hand . As soon as she saw the truck she ran to meet it . <p> " I got my money , " Cyrus said . He waited for some sign that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet paper sack . " <p> She stared at him as though she had never seen him before . <p> " Charged him with stationary rape . " <p> She turned away and started back to the house . Cyrus jumped from the pickup and skipped sideways trying to stay in front of her . His head . pounded and his heart raced . <p> " And I fixed it so we wo n't have to move until you graduate , " he said . <p> She continued toward the house . " I ca n't get out of here fast enough , " she said . <p> He felt his anger rising . Talking to her was like eating grit . " Do n't you see ? " he said . He had to stop to get his breath . <p> The screen door wheezed open and slammed behind her . She started up the stairs . <p> " I made him an honest man , " he yelled . <p> She leaned over the banister as he followed . " He never touched me , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room and leaned against the jamb to get his breath again . <p> She raised her hands to her hips and stared at him . A hot wind stirred her hair . <p> Cyrus 's sense of loss was so strong he could taste it . <p> " You do n't need to work for him , " he said . <p> Sunlight slanted through the window , its glow magnified by the mirror above her dresser . Motes of dust swam in the air . In the harsh light he felt as old as Methuselah . <p> <p> By RICHARD THORMAN <p>
