Once among the hottest names on Wall Street , makers of solar panels , wind turbines , and other environmentally friendly gear are in for a difficult year . In 2008 , almost every stock in the green space fell harder than the rest of the market during an all-around terrible year for equities . While the S &P; 500 index declined by more than a third , several popular green indexes fared worse , slumping between 60 percent and 70 percent . Now , as many of those stocks languish near record lows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waiting until money begins to flow from the government 's $787 billion stimulus package . Even when the spigot opens , it 's not clear that a new commitment to renewable energy will be enough to revive the fortunes of an entire industry . Simply put , problems in the green space go beyond the ongoing recession and the credit crisis . An even bigger drag is overly sunny expectations for sales of wind turbines and solar panels . A bit of history : Earlier in the decade , a mix of generous subsidy plans and easy money sparked a miniboom , fueled by a flood of venture capital and a seemingly unquenchable demand for shares of a small number of publicly traded companies . Between 2004 and 2007 , private-sector investments in solar jumped almost 20-fold . As money poured in , output soared -- just as demand was about to be hit by a devastating one-two punch . First , subsidy rollbacks in key markets like Spain hurt . And then the credit crisis froze financing for new projects . Suppliers suddenly found themselves with too many solar panels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wall Street darlings like SunPower and SunTech were announcing job cuts . OptiSolar , a thin-film solar panel maker , slashed 300 jobs , or half of its staff , in January . VeraSun , an ethanol maker , filed for bankruptcy and is selling off several plants in the Midwest . Even wind 's most visible backer , Texan oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens , has scaled back his plans to develop " America 's wind corridor . " At the same time , with oil prices dipping below $40 a barrel ( more than $100 cheaper than last year 's peak ) , the economics of all sorts of clean energy are far less attractive . The industry 's fortunes are likely to get worse before they get better , with 2009 shaping up as a " shakeout year . " Ted Sullivan , an analyst at Lux Research , sees a stark demarcation , particularly among large , publicly traded solar companies facing a near collapse in demand . " You could have every solar company fail but the top 15 and still have a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , is already picking winners . Valuations remain relatively high for just a few companies . Industry leaders First Solar , SunPower , and Energy Conversion Devices have so far managed to hold some of their value . But Wall Street is beginning to count some of the other players out . Many analysts expect less-well-capitalized firms without substantial technological advantages to fall by the wayside over the next few years . " Ambitious goal . " The brightest hope for an overall recovery in green energy remains an environmentally friendly president . The Obama administration 's pledge to double clean-energy production over three years would have been scoffed at as conservative just a year ago , says Ethan Zindler , head of North American Research for New Energy Finance . " Now that 's a pretty ambitious goal , " he says . The massive stimulus could help , but the billions of dollars targeted for clean energy can not offset all the losses . Analysts at Merrill Lynch say fleeing investment already renders last year 's passage of a key solar-related tax credit " impotent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers apply for grants directly from the federal government . That could prove a lifeline for replacing a vital source of funding destroyed by the credit crisis . Before the crunch , investors , often big banks , helped fund large chunks of solar or wind projects by purchasing tax credits from developers to offset their own tax bill . As profits disappeared , so have most of those so-called tax equity investors . Already , the industry is feeling the difference . Mark Morelli , president and CEO of Energy Conversion Devices , says , " Last year , everything was getting financed . Every project you could put on the market was snapped up immediately . Clearly , things are much more selective . " For now , government help may very well allow the green energy industry to survive . For it to thrive , however , both financing and demand will have to recover .
