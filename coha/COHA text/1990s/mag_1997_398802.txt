Psychologists Mary Siegel and Paul Donoghue see many clients with MS in their practice . Having lived with MS herself ' far more than ten years , Dr Siegel understands both per Headnote son and professionally why people sometimes find recovery bewildering ... // " If I 'm better physically , why am I feeling so crummy ? " Jeannette , a delicate brunette , asked recently . " Two months ago I would have sold my soul to walk again . Here I am walking , but I feel so anxious . My world feels upside down . " An exacerbation is a grueling time . Why , then , is the hoped for , prayed for remission troubling ? Jeannette is not alone in experiencing anxiety , self-doubt , and depression just as she begins feeling better . Like many others , she asks herself : " Was I really sick ? " " Was I exaggerating ? " " Maybe I did n't try hard enough . " These doubts lead on to self-blame : " Maybe I 've got some sick need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought . " When Illness Takes Over When we are deeply immersed in an illness , the world becomes very small . Initially , we resist relinquishing control over our lives or abandoning normal activities . But , eventually , in the face of unrelenting symptoms , we pull back . To ourselves and others we are ill . We need to be taken care of , visited , asked about , sent cards and flowers . Our friends are relieved when we have a request because helping us relieves their helplessness . They 're happy to laugh with us because laughter breaks tension and gives us all hope . Adjusting to Illness We actually adjust to life as a sick person . No longer achievers meeting obligations and going out in the world-we assess our days by medications taken , meals eaten , or TV programs watched . Our main obligation is awesomely difficult for we must ask ourselves to cope with courage and good humor . We strive not to burden further those who love us . There is great meaning in this task-so we work at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we can not change . And Then ... We begin to feel better ! The goal of courageous acceptance changes . We are no longer so helpless or dependent , yet we feel insecure . All the responsibilities we gave up-the shopping , the driving , the disciplining of our children-we want to take back . But when ? How ? Will we be able to handle our former activities-and for how long ? Maybe this remission is temporary . Those who have been caring for us are perplexed and disappointed if we are n't happy They expect a sunny disposition and a return to former productivity . At the same time , they fear another exacerbation just as we do . They may worry about our attempts to return to our old independence and authority They may even resent it . The Shaky Days of Transition While we were ill , our friends , family , and co-workers have been together , doing things , going places , making decisions . Harriet , a mother and professional librarian , described the state in one of our support groups : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out . Then I must have become used to my friends coming over so often . Some would confide in me as they never had before . I felt rather special . Now I 'm at sea . They do things that do n't include me . They 've made plans that I 'm not in on . Friends I was very close to seem to call one another regularly but do n't call me . It 's as if they do n't know how to relate to me now that I 'm feeling better . " Finding a New Present The future can be fearsome . Will the symptoms return ? Will they be worse next time ? What if we lose our jobs or insurance ? Can we really adjust to more disability ? Is it worth it to try to get started again ? It is never easy to live in the present . After an exacerbation we may focus so much on future uncertainties that we ca n't manage the difficult present where so many things need to be re-established . All this anxiety needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ill " self . Any change , even positive change , is unsettling . That 's why recovery is no simple time of celebration . We need calm , good sense to determine what is realistic and what is not , from day to day We need to feel our way gently , try out new behaviors , rethink our daily schedule , listen to our needs , and adjust our sense of what we can do and what we can not . These points may help : Establish short-term goals . Be realistic . Do n't try to make up for the weeks or months of inactivity . Share feelings and needs with others and ask for understanding and support . Respond openly to the efforts of others ; they are also adjusting to change . Meaning and serenity can come from accepting this period of transition for what it is-baffling , challenging , sometimes painful , but also exhilarating and hopeful . Author Affiliation Drs .
