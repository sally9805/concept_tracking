It is true that I got crazy the week I drew the first payment on my line of credit , but after all , the amount was large . I accepted the bank check , stiff and clean in its plain white envelope , and instead of depositing it immediately put it to my face , smelled the clean rasp of paper , ink . Then I walked out the door and went to my car . I placed the money on the dashboard , where it could tell me all about itself . God knows , I wanted so bad to hear . A long time back , when land was cheap , I 'd bought a quarter section just west of Fargo . I 'd leased it to a guy named Moen , who put all that acreage into flowers . Sunflowers . Now they were in bloom . It was August , not the dog days of heat but clear and cool . I drove out to the future site with my check reflected in the windshield . My belief was this : I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed this idea , this plan , it was going to work , and I was going to put it into operation . <p> I am Mauser &; Mauser , Construction . There is no other Mauser , no partner , just myself . I doubled my name because I thought it looked more stable , as though there were generations involved , although I had built up the cash , crews , and equipment by myself over the years . I had made my own success from nothing , from a secondhand Cat bulldozer and a couple of boys who could n't get their high school diplomas . I had patched together my own company by scraping money off the cash edifice , the limestone facades of banks . I walked through doors of black glass , through the tinted lobbies , over wheat-rich carpet , over sugar-beet wealth and desks of polished oak bought off the interest on loans to sunflower farmers like Moen . I went in with the grit of digging septic systems under my nails and I came out , time after time , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those were the ground-floor days when the local boom was just beginning , way back when there was interstate to build and local crews got hired on by the government . I did n't bid too high and did n't bid too low , and I held where proper , a knack I 'd learned at the keno tables . It worked beautifully . <p> And now I had this . More zeros in a string than I 'd ever seen . <p> I turned down a dirt road between two of my fields , parked , opened my windows , and let the day in , the day of perfect sunflowers . Their leaves brushed in the still air , dollar bills in a vault of blue sky . Their fat , chock-full faces , surrounded by petals , reminded me of legions of rich women in fancy hats . <p> I laughed and sank back in the warm seat , let the sun shine hard . Cannons popped , set to go off on small timers so the blackbirds would n't land . Moen had tied balloons to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like owls . The fields looked jolly , circus bright , and of course the blackbirds were n't the least afraid . You could hear them pecking , flapping , talking , feeding noisily and full of joy . <p> Moen happened by , stopped his truck . I stepped out into the field and both of us stood there awhile , looking at the crop . I told him my first draw had come through , showed him the check even . He did not look pleased , he did not in fact look at me at all . I had n't thought exactly what my good fortune meant for Bill Moen , but the truth is he only had those fields on a lease which was up four months ago . He knew what was coming . Naturally , I intended to let him work the fields until I broke ground next month . He had to get his yield in , of course . But those fields were the first open land past the last mall , between the DollarSave and Nowhere . Any fool could have figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin . He had a bad shave , all nicked . <p> " You 're putting in what , a new development ? " he asked . <p> I nodded . He nodded . We stood there nodding at the nodding heads of sunflowers . We stood there in a vast field of serene and unthinking agreement , but we were thinking different things . Moen said : " These are good fields . Rich dirt . Too bad . " <p> I did n't want Moen raining on my party . <p> " Too bad what ? " I said . " You 'll get a lot of money from this crop , it 's a bumper . You 'll buy a big damn house right at the end of this cul-de-sac . " I stamped my foot on the ground . " We 'll build it here . Every one of your kids will have their own room . Your wife will have a dream kitchen . " <p> I do n't have a wife , " said Moen . <p> " Your kids will cook then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll make everything the right height , their bathrooms , the dish sink , whatever , so they wo n't have to always stand on stools . " <p> " Kids grow , " Moen said . <p> " Bless ' em , " I agreed , but there must have been a note in my voice , maybe a little edge . Moen was getting on my nerves . <p> We stood in silence and then Moen said , real loud : " The more you fill it up the emptier it gets . " <p> I could n't believe my ears . <p> " People have to live somewhere , " I said , and my voice was mild enough , but inside I was boiling . I was mad . My wife , Ira , had told me a trick to try and keep my temper when I was in that no-man's-land between feeling normal and letting go . She said to just put a cage up , a wire cage , to visualize the chain-link and stay inside the damn thing like an animal . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could go wild , I could let off my steam like I had just been captured in a jungle . The only thing was , I had to stay in the cage , not jump the fence , not ever let myself out until I knew I was good and ready . <p> I was not ready . I got into my car , backed out , and drove away without saying good-bye to Moen . I wanted to celebrate , to raise the roof , not deal with his problems , his mistakes . He probably needed those fields to get himself over the edge , he probably felt like shit when he thought of a new house that he never could afford in this life anyway , in this world , and I 'd pushed it in his face . I did n't look back . I drove to town and wished I could get Ira and go to this bar I liked called The Library , but she was in a real library . She was back in school getting her psychology degree , after which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with me . <p> I passed the bar . I doubled back , drove right up . I pulled into the lot , went in and sat down . It was quiet , no music , no noise . It was only eleven o'clock and there was nothing happening . <p> I had two beers . A hamburger . Two more beers . I did n't know what to do  --  go back to the office or the current work site or what . There was plenty to do , but I felt like that day should be experienced different , out of time , out of my regular life . Because of all the hard work I 'd done and the work that was in store , I should enjoy the zeros on the check I held right in my inside pocket . I should go to the lakes , fish , I should eat out , enjoy the cash , the fat roll I 'd taken out of my account against the big deposit I would feed it later on . I should , I should . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love who you should love , you ca n't stop loving who you should n't . My problem was always with how I should be versus how I really was . <p> " I should go back to work , " I said , and instead I ordered my fifth beer . <p> That one 's always the one that gets me . I weigh 220 . I can handle four and then I skate in the sky . I promised , as I poured the Blue Ribbon , that this was my last little gesture . <p> I took a sip , a slow one , looked at the door as it opened , and kept on staring as this woman walked in . She was wearing a black shirt with the sleeves sliced off . Her arms were round and smooth , full of silver bracelets set with cool stones , turquoise , agates . She was tall , had a snub nose and a round , full mouth . She did n't take off her sunglasses , though the room was dark . Maybe it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby , I 've been waiting for you , " I said loud enough so she could have heard if she wanted to , but I was only kidding . I did n't think she 'd take me up on the line or take me serious at all . She turned and did that thing some women do , cocked her hip and looked . Just looked . What she did then was nothing , but it said too much . She began to take off her sunglasses . She shifted them down her nose , real slow , but put them back up before I could see her eyes . Her legs were long , a little full in the hips . She had this big blond hairdo that would smell of chemicals or bubble gum . It curled , stood out in a bush , as though just chopped into this shape with a hatchet or messed up in the backseat of a car . <p> She sat down and when she did take her glasses off I drank her in . She had the sweet trustworthy face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see it in her eyes . <p> " Skipping school ? " I asked . <p> She shrugged . " I 'm not in school . I 'm twenty-one . " <p> " What do you do , " I said , " for work ? " <p> " I 'm between jobs , " she smiled . <p> That smile just tore right through me , like I 'd been looking for it all my life . In Ira 's eyes I had been seeing a reflection of Ira , not of myself . Marlis , that 's what her name was , looked at me a different way . I was sure that she saw who I was , a man stuck down at the bottom of a well , a drainage ditch , always looking out from the pit of himself like a man in a grave . Marlis saw me down there but she did n't stay up in the blue sky where it was safe . She climbed right down to be with me , and suddenly I was not shit-faced lonely . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon now . Two . There were two of us to look at the row of zeros . Two of us all day . There would be two of us to go to bed . The room felt warm and close . Marlis looked older , suddenly , yet full of high school charm . I thought her breasts would be heavy , light , delicate , big , I could n't think . I could feel them in my hands as I sat there looking at her . <p> " What do you want ? " she said , smiling that same smile , but I did n't say what my hands wanted . I said a different thing . <p> " Another beer , " I said . <p> " You got it . " <p> She went over to the bar and bought and paid for one and carried it over by herself . <p> " Now you 're going to have to buy me one , " she said . " Fair is fair . " <p> So we sat there for a while , talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . I mean the way I thought of her at first . This thing happened that I was not sure I wanted to happen . I started thinking of her as someone too young , and looking at her made me sad , reminded me of the fact that I was forty-eight and I missed my stepdaughter . <p> " What do you really want ? " she asked me , a little later , grinning as she said it . <p> I did n't answer her awhile . I just stared at her , and I guess my face was full of conflict , was not exactly the face of a man about to have a good time . <p> She leaned over , grabbed my chin in her hand . <p> " What the fuck , you 're here , are n't you ? " <p> " Yeah , " I laughed at myself , " I was going to say something strange . You want to hear it anyway ? At first , I was going to say that I want you . The thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Real rich . What you want is to be real rich , " she said . " I know you better than you know yourself . You think if you 're rich you 're more real . My dad was rich . " <p> " I 'm rich , too . " <p> " I 'm poor , " she said . " My dad kicked me out . " She touched the tip of my collar . " Maybe we need each other . " <p> We started laughing , and the hell of it was that we could n't stop . We just kept on laughing and laughing until we were asked to leave . And I knew the bartender . <p> " Please , " I said , " just let me get my shit together . " <p> " Someplace else , " he said , not unkind . <p> We did go elsewhere . We went down the street , and I stopped drinking as the day wore on . Then started again . I called Ira , left a message on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started near the bridge and in the warmth of August and the length of light we made every bar in Moorhead once and ended up at The Treetop , where they have a piano player sitting at a grand piano . Roses in small vases on the tables . Big menus with gold tassels . <p> " Good evening , Mr. Mauser , " said our host . <p> I put my fingers up . " For two . " <p> I could tell by the way he looked at us that he hoped that Marlis was my kid , my niece , something like that . She had started looking even younger than twenty , but somehow she never got carded . The maitre d ' found us a table by the window where we could look out over the city and see the lights come up softly in the dusk . All day I had been asking Marlis about herself , but not until we were sitting up on top of the twin towns looking down at the river and the Hjemkomst Center did she tell me the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I went to St. Bennie 's for a year . " <p> " Sure you did . " <p> " No shit ! " <p> She laughed a little , and then her mouth sagged down on one side , as I was watching , and it was not as though she 'd made a face or was constructing any kind of expression at all . It was involuntary , like a mental patient . It was something that she could n't help , and she kept doing it . She did it again . <p> " You 're making a face , " I told her . " Are you okay ? " <p> She slapped her hand onto the place her mouth fell and kept it there , as though she wore a mask and it was slipping off . I had a straight shot and then I do n't remember what we ordered , what I ate . I do n't remember anything until I found us both way down the end of Main at last in a motel called The Sunset . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . I fumbled change from my pocket and I bought an orange soda , drank it standing in the cold light . When I had drunk the can dry I took out my pocketknife and I enlarged the pull-top hole until it was big enough for me to stuff in my car keys and what remained of my wad of bills . As for the check , I wrapped that in a piece of plastic from the garbage and put it under a rock in the landscaping . <p> " Marlis , " I said as I walked in the door . " You have to take me as I am . I 'm poor . My hands are empty , see ? " <p> She turned to me in the light of the bathroom fixtures . Her shirt was off . Her breasts were different than I 'd imagined , narrower , sleek . <p> " Your hands are n't empty , Jack , " she said when I touched her . <p> You might think this was something cheap , that it was ridiculous , that because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age difference , nothing good could come of it . True , but what I knew about Marlis at the time was that she 'd go to the bottom with me . And she 'd stay there , not drowning , just floating amiably , not bored , like a fish in a tank . Ira was strictly dry . She was that hot summer wind that sucks every drop of juice from the air . She was sane , she was kind , and I hardly ever drank around her . Sure , I loved her , and she knew it . Ira also knew that every so often I would just let go and throw myself to the winds of chance , of fate . She could count on two things only : I would come home when I was sober . I would use a Sheik . <p> This was different , not more threatening to Ira , just different . The minute I touched Marlis I knew it was n't right . I was in a little moment of sobriety , the kind of clarity that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I held her against me as we lay in this rotten bed . Even half passed out , I could tell how uncomfortable it was . <p> " Look , " I said , " this makes no sense . " <p> " I know . " <p> She lowered herself onto me and then  --  it is unclear how it started  --  we were making love . She was moving on top of me , the whole bed shaking on its flimsy metal rig , the nonacoustic ceiling magnifying the sound of our breathing until I was sure everybody on the east side of Moorhead could hear it . I was conscious of everything around me , which is usually not the case . I could n't forget where I was or who I was or that this girl might be a runaway . I put my hands on her hips and it was a kind gesture , not a sexual one . I was just trying to help her keep her balance . I was just trying not to completely embarrass myself . <p> She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking off . I had this strange thought I 'd never had before , that only women are supposed to have . I 'd fake an orgasm , just to stop her , but then she stopped herself . She lunged forward and slipped right off me and smashed her head against the wall over the pillow . It was one of these cheap Sheetrock walls where the studs are set too far apart , but would n't you know , you can never get a stud in the right place to hang a picture , but she found one with her skull . After the fervent crash , she sagged down on me , limp and unaware . I rolled out from under her , panicked . I did n't know what to do  --  give her mouth-to-mouth , give her oxygen ? I laid her down on the bed and propped her head up and sponged her with a handful of ice wrapped in a wet washcloth . After a few minutes , her eyes opened . <p> " Brother , " she said , " what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Holy shit , " she said . " I 've never done that before . " <p> She lay there , very solemn . " You 're really something , " she said at last . <p> " No , " I said when I 'd grasped her meaning , " it was n't me . It was n't sex . You never came , you just smashed your head into the wall . " <p> " Oh for God 's sake ! " She sat up , mad or embarrassed , and then she laughed abruptly . Her mouth sagged on one side , the way it had in the restaurant , and her voice hardened . " Did you look through my purse while I was out ? Feel free . Here . " <p> She leaned down , wincing , and picked up her shirt and her heavy denim shoulder bag . She reached in and drew out a plump little brown envelope of leather . I waved it away , but she insisted that I had to look because , she said , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least you 're honest . " She threw it at me . " Open it ! " <p> " Okay , " I said , " if that 's what you want . " <p> I turned her wallet over and dumped everything in it on the bedspread . <p> There were six credit cards , three gold , three platinum . There were five crisp one hundred dollar bills and change for a twenty . There was a picture of an elderly woman and a picture of Marlis . There was a lucky four-leaf clover encased in plastic . <p> I did n't know what to say . I looked at the credit cards , all in different names , male names . <p> " I did n't steal them , just in case you 're wondering . " <p> " I was . " <p> " I 'm actually twenty-five , " she said . She turned on the light beside the bed and let it shine on her face , but she now looked about fourteen to me . I could n't figure . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . I just wanted to get out of the room . I had a feeling that I had stumbled against someone much different than I 'd thought at first , I had a feeling that this whole thing was very wrong . I was n't attracted to it in the least , not at all . I thought of Ira , at home asleep , I thought of Mauser &; Mauser , my line of work , my project , my check stowed underneath a rock . I felt like a fool for putting this complication , this girl or woman , into my life . Clearly , she was n't someone who would just go away . <p> " We 're going to hang out here , " she said , " get some sleep . Then you 're going with me tomorrow . You 're going to be my dad , buy me some clothes and a car . " <p> " No , I 'm not . " <p> " Yes , you are . " <p> She unzipped a little pouch in the back of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit , the kind that farm kids can get when they need to drive the equipment . There was her birth date , in black and white . I subtracted . Fifteen years old . <p> " You just told me you were twenty-five . " <p> " I lied . " <p> " I 'm getting out of here . " <p> I grabbed my things and started to walk out of the room . <p> " Have you ever heard the term ' statutory rape ' ? " she called after me . <p> I understood . I slept the night on the bedroom floor . I tried not to wonder what was going to happen in the morning . I could n't decide whether or not I deserved what was in store . <p> " I suppose you want a sports car , " I said the next day , as we sat in the booth of a sunny diner near Pioneer Mall . It was like having the devil for a daughter all of a sudden , and none of the good parts , none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping menace that I had to appease . <p> " First the school clothes , Dad ! " <p> I nodded and picked up the check , pulling the bills off the roll I 'd picked up out of the orange-soda can . They were stuck together from the sweet pop . Across the polished tiles and planters in the lobby there was a long , low teenage kind of store stuffed with clothes , flashing neon , playing loud rock music , trimmed with glass and chrome . We went in . She began to touch things all over the place , to unrack things , to take them off their hangers and pile them in her arms . <p> " Pretend we had a fire , " her mouth was sagging , " I need new things , a whole new wardrobe . Pretend that you and Mom got a divorce and you 're trying to win my love back by spoiling me . Pretend we 're lovers , " she licked her lips , and then her face sagged in that funny way again , " pretend we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen someone try things on the way she tried things on , the whole store went in and out of her dressing room , along with belts , shoes , clothes pulled off the mannequins , socks , underwear . She had the store manager in there with her , helping her , eyeing a big fat sale . At one point , though , in the frenzy , she forgot herself . She forgot to watch me and she handed me a size eight and said she needed a ten and would I go get it at the last rack on the right . Her mistake . I walked over to the rack and hung up the pants and kept on walking . Out of the mall , down the street , over to the bus , and back to The Sunset . It took me an hour to get there , and I tried not to look suspicious as I kicked over rock after rock trying to remember which one I 'd placed on top of the wrapped check . By the time I finally found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my throat . But there it was , still big as life , with all the zeros intact . <p> I 'd had my car keys all along , but I had n't told Marlis where the car was parked . Now I walked over to The Library lot to get it , and there was Ira , sitting in the front seat , reading a book . I guess she figured I 'd have to come back here before I came home . <p> I leaned over beside her , at the open window . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . <p> She waved my breath away . <p> " Get in . " <p> I did , and she drove us straight to the drive-up window of the bank , where I wrote out a deposit slip . " This is the last nice thing I 'm doing for you , " she told me , and then said nothing , just looked straight ahead , distracted and calm . I watched her pure , clear profile , Nordic , honed and filed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving . <p> " Where are you going ? " I asked . My voice so small , so unnoticeable , so guilty , that she was able to brush it away the same as she had my apology . <p> " I 'm driving you out to the construction site , " she said . " Your stuff is already out there in the accounts trailer . " <p> " Oh come on , Ira . " I was hurting . " It was just a onetime thing . " <p> She turned on me , her face fierce . <p> " So is this , " she answered . " This is the one time I 'm getting rid of you . " <p> I could n't believe the timing , could n't quite understand the reasoning , but her self-assurance suddenly made me desperate . <p> " I have n't done anything to you ! " <p> For some reason this just made her laugh , and her laugh was surprising , free , as though she enjoyed my wit . She stopped abruptly and drove in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that your capacity for fucking up is far beyond what I can help you with . " <p> That gave me something to think about . She hummed a little tune to herself , and it occurred to me to tell her it bothered me , to stop , but I did n't . I thought maybe if I kept my mouth shut she 'd turn the car around and bring me home , make me lunch . <p> She pulled up into the construction yard . Her car was already parked there alongside the bulldozer and a couple of tractors , so I guess she had a friend in on this scheme . I felt it coming on then , as she indicated with a neutral wave that I should go . I had this hot place in my stomach , this empty place that sent the anger up my arms like cold jelly , the rage into my head . The sudden feeling was so blinding and futile that it scared even me . I tried to stop it from happening , and I put myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was in the wire enclosure , in my mind I mean , Ira walked away and got into her car . Before I could jump out and catch her , I was alone in the dirt lot . Her car was already raising dust on the road to town . <p> And she took my car keys . Maybe by mistake , but they were n't there in the ignition . <p> I stumbled out of the car , wheeled around , went looking in the windows of the other cars , the equipment , finally climbed up on the bulldozer . I was in luck . The silver key was in the ignition , I turned it , started the thing up and went after Ira at full throttle , thinking I would catch her somehow , cut her off before she took the turn to town . I would yell at her , reason with her , weep , pull my hair and throw myself down at her feet or beneath the cleated treads of the dozer .

It was as though the power of the machine , the throb and heft of it , the things I could do with a lever and a switch , were part of my anger then . <p> It got too big for me , too big for the wire net I put up to contain it , too big for anything . It roared over me and I grappled with it weakly for one moment and then I was out of the cage , bigger than life , stronger than shit , rattling iron on iron down the road with my blade in the air and looking for I did n't know what , until I saw it , until I saw Moen 's fields . <p> My fields . The flowers looked at me , all fat and frowsy , full of light . <p> " Harvesttime ! " I shouted , sweeping in with the blade lowered , and I kept on shouting , I do n't know what , as I cleared swath after swath , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds , as the seeds rang down on the hot metal , as the seeds poured down my neck and shirt , as the heads of sunflowers bounced off the sides of the machine and the dust flew everywhere , a great cloud that hung around me in the air of a drying noon . <p> I 'm not a truly destructive man . I 've constructed about anything that you could name . You look around Fargo  --  banks , half the hospital complex , the highway , Vistawood Views , the nursing home , most of the mall , house upon house  --  you 'll see it 's set up and hooked in and put there to stay by Jack Mauser . I do things from plans . I make them real . I could build myself if I could get a guy that could design me . But since that 's not possible , I 've always relied on women .

Then , if you 're like me , you just leave them to grow , as if the woman you 've married is a hired gardener . <p> I stripped most of a field down before that cold strength stopped flowing through my arms . I was breathing hard and my eyes were fixed upon the gauges and dials of the machine 's control panel . I could n't hear anything around me , anything outside myself , and then gradually my heart slowed and the adrenaline that had flooded me turned so mellow I lay back in my seat . I surveyed the crushed welter of stalks and plants on which the birds were already lighting with starved cries . In the distance I could see people , Moen , my construction crew , coming at me . Ira 's car was n't in sight . <p> The heat lifted off the fields like a gleaming veil . I 'd always intended to build the best house in the whole development for Ira . She would n't want one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them rising anyway . I saw stone trim with clerestory windows , the Gothic look , or Colonial Homes with shutters , plantation-like spreads with columns to either side of the front door . I would set the mailboxes into little brick hutches that could not be knocked over by a teenager with a baseball bat . I would sod in big lawns , plant seven-year-old maples . The garages would be double , triple , some with arches , and all would open automatically to accept their owners . Executives would buy these places , school principals , the owners of local businesses , wealthy farmers who wanted a town home in the winter . I would name the place The Crest . Just The Crest . Not Crest Park , Crest Acres , Crest Ridge , Crest Wood , or Crest Go Fuck Yourself . My development would speak class through simplicity , like it just meant the top of something , the place we all want to get . <p> Louise Erdrich 's most recent story in Harper 's Magazine was " The Leap , " which appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tales of Burning Love , to be published next year . <p>
