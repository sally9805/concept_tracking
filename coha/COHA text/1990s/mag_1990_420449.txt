Section : Business Gorbachev tries to save the imploding Soviet economy-and the union <p> Dateline : Moscow <p> Mankind has not managed to create anything more efficient than a market economy , ' asserted the so-called 500 Days plan for sweeping Soviet economic reform . But last week brought fresh evidence that the market 's magic could be years away . A day after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to end the cold war , President Mikhail Gorbachev released his latest plan for salvaging the moribund economy . The new blueprint amounted to a rejection of much of the 500 Days plan , and while it was nominally a scheme for converting to a market economy , few Western economists believed it would accomplish that . More than anything else , the document was political - an eleventh-hour attempt to hold the splintering Soviet Union together . <p> Under attack for failing to move wholesale to the market , Gorbachev had crafted a compromise package of reforms designed to blend elements of the 500 Days plan with Soviet government proposals to rescue the sinking economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of Soviet radicals to move toward a market , while somehow maintaining a heavy government hand in the economy to preserve his power base and keep bureaucrats on board . But the bid to please everyone did not succeed . The package may have reduced some of the risks posed by the 500 Days plan : Skyrocketing unemployment and hyperinflation reminiscent of the German Weimar Republic following World War I. Yet many economists claimed the middle ground would only make a sick economy worse . Gorbachev 's longtime political rival Boris Yeltsin , leader of the giant Russian Republic , pronounced the plan " a catastrophe . " The stage is now set for a showdown between Gorbachev and Russia , as well as with other republics bent on breaking with the union and pursuing their own economic reforms . <p> ' February Revolution ' ' ? Soviet lawmakers gave preliminary approval to the plan last week , yet the package 's prescriptions appeared to offer little defense against looming dangers . The Soviet economy is now mired in a dreadful no man 's land : Many features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market - including free prices , the right to property and the quest for profits - have n't sprung up to take their place . Industrial production has plummeted and the state distribution system has almost completely collapsed , boosting the underground economy , widening the gap between haves and have-nots and worsening the erratic shortages of everything from cigarettes to clothing . Inflation is soaring at an estimated 100 percent , and much of a near-record harvest of wheat and potatoes has been rotting in the fields , in part because the government can no longer muster enough workers to pick the crops . Some Soviet experts now fear that the chaos could spark disastrous strikes , riots and political upheaval in the months ahead . " We are going to see another February Revolution , ' contends Leon Aron , a Soviet analyst at the Heritage Foundation , invoking the violent uprising that preceded the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 . <p> Rebuking Marx . Gorbachev 's new plan was supposed to head off many of these calamities , but instead it appeared to be an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last summer , in an effort to mend fences with Yeltsin , he struck a deal to let a group of radical economists draw up a plan to overhaul the economy . Led by two key economic advisers to Gorbachev and Yeltsin , Stanislav Shatalin and Grigory Yavlinsky , the team had proposed a dramatic plan to stabilize the country 's chaotic finances , sell off state-owned assets like housing and land , dismantle Soviet ministries ' choke hold on state enterprises and launch the conversion to a market in just 500 days . In language worthy of John Locke - and rebuking the nation 's Marxist-Leninist past - the plan endorsed private ownership of all forms of property as the linchpin of a market and even the key to human freedom . <p> For all its boldness , the 500 Days proposal also had serious flaws . For example , the plan 's authors were so determined to break up monopolistic enterprises that they proposed a state Anti-Monopoly Committee to promote competition - clearly presenting an opportunity for displaced bureaucrats to find a roost , says Gregory Grossman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the plan 's swift timetable was clearly unrealistic ; in a culture where capitalist sensibilities are still so alien , selling enterprises swiftly to managers and workers unattuned to the realities of running or operating businesses in a marketplace could spawn as much chaos as any economic alternative . The entire package met fierce opposition from much of the Soviet government . Particularly outraged was Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov , who sits atop the maze of ministries that direct much of the planned economy . <p> Gorbachev , too , apparently feared aspects of the plan that would have given the republics almost total control over their economic destinies , turning the Soviet Union into little more than a common market with a greatly weakened central government and a questionable role for the Soviet President . He also was surely alarmed by government predictions of unemployment and inflation following implementation of the 500 Days plan . Economic shock therapy might work in Poland - where the elected government can lay claim to a mandate for reform - but it is unlikely that the Soviet government could have survived such intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 500 Days plan or the far more conservative measures proposed by Ryzhkov , the Supreme Soviet directed Gorbachev to craft a compromise between the two . Yeltsin had derided that effort as an attempt to " mate a hedgehog and a snake , " and last week the offspring emerged as misshapen as he had predicted . In fact , the new blueprint combined many of the worst features of both the 500 Days and Ryzhkov plans . For example , to stabilize the financial system , fight inflation and restore value to the nearly worthless ruble , Gorbachev called for deep budget cuts and creation of a strong central bank and federal reserve system to keep a tight rein on the money supply . In theory , this could lead to curbing the economy 's excess stock of rubles , an estimated 400 billion of which are stashed in Soviet mattresses . Yet the plan also promised to index workers ' wages for inflation , grant cheap loans to consumers and create funds to bail out ailing enterprises - all guaranteed to drive up the budget deficit and flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices on everything from consumer staples to raw materials would be raised dramatically , though most prices would be freed gradually between now and 1992 . But in the short run , these government-administered price hikes would only fuel inflation , rather than create realistic cues for the production of goods , says Stanford University economist John Litwack . <p> Few details . Gorbachev 's plan also fudged details and pushed back the timetable for converting state enterprises and other assets to private ownership . Under the 500 Days plan , many large enterprises were to be converted to joint-stock companies almost immediately , while the new plan noted that the process of " destatization " must be " stretched out over a lengthy period of time . ' And although the blueprint endorsed " the equality of all types of ownership ' - including complete ownership by foreigners of firms within the Soviet Union - it was n't immediately clear how far the right to property would extend . Soviets now can not legally own businesses outright or hire and fire workers , and Gorbachev 's plan lacked explicit reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet lawmakers ultimately give final approval to Gorbachev 's plan , the key question is what the impact will be on the deepening rift between Moscow and the republics and between Gorbachev and Yeltsin . Russia 's lawmakers voted overwhelmingly last month to follow the 500 Days plan , and Yeltsin said last week that the republic may still launch the program on November 1 . But if Russia goes forward , it would almost immediately begin selling off state assets and enterprises to which the central government still lays claim . That could leave Gorbachev with the choice of cutting a deal with Yeltsin to dismiss Ryzhkov and enact more-radical reforms or sending in tanks to surround Russian factories . " It 's going to be one of those moments of history when two men with claims to authority stand nose to nose and eyeball to eyeball , ' says University of Pennsylvania economist Herbert Levine . " Someone has got to give or have an open struggle . ' <p> Conflicts also loom over natural resources : Many republics want exclusive rights over the oil , metals and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of dollars ' worth of precious hard currency each year . Under Gorbachev 's plan , the central government would continue to control exports of petroleum products , gold and diamonds , while funneling an unspecified share of the proceeds to the republics . But many are so eager to break with the union that the prospect of a check in the mail from Moscow may not be enough . The tug of war over resources could now take years to resolve . <p> Battle of the republics . The disputes between republics and the center may only exacerbate the current distribution problems , fueling social tensions . Squirreling away goods in short supply , republics like Russia and the Ukraine are refusing to ship each other gasoline , meat and other products unless they are paid in hard currency or similarly scarce goods . Yet many products are finding their way to consumers through subterranean channels : The state stores may be empty , but lots of refrigerators are full . As aspects of a market come about through the back door , those who can afford to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are better off than they 've ever been , ' says Ed Hewett , an economist at the Brookings Institution . But pensioners and others who must shop at state stores have been clobbered by shortages and inflation , and some may face hunger in coming months . <p> No Soviet economic plan has ever been enacted as devised , and Gorbachev 's latest will be no exception . It may yet be blended with other aspects of the 500 Days plan or , faced with continued deterioration of the economy , the politically adroit president could invoke expanded powers recently granted him by the Supreme Soviet and undertake more market-oriented changes . Economist Shatalin has described Soviet reformers ' task as an effort to cobble together warm boots , leaving it up to the politicians to decide whether to wear them in July or December . Now , it remains to be seen whether Gorbachev will really plunge barefoot into the stark winter ahead . <p> Picture : Signs of a growing class struggle .
