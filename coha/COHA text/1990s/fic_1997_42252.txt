Frontiers mean quite different . things to different people . . . . When I 'm off duty , I like to go up on Carver 's Peak and watch the really big ships come in . I remember the last time I saw Ashley 's Charm , all five kilometers of her , slowly being brought in by the tugs to the huge interstellar spaceport here on Cameron . As I watched her gain size against the background of diamond-bright stars , she slowly turned as the tugs oriented her for parking orbit insertion , and the doors of the thousands of individual spacecraft berths came visible . Photograph <p> I looked at my watch . Two more hours . In two more hours , I 'd be back on duty , and as a senior port loadmaster , I 'd be responsible for assigning transport slots to the multitude of individual ships that-had come from deep down the well of the Solar Systemfrom Earth , from Mars , the inner asteroid belt , and the satellite systems of the gas giants-craft bearing families intent on leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universe and build a life out there under the light of other suns . One of those ships coming up from Earth-Luna actually-would be carrying my Mom and Dad and little sister . They 'd be arriving on Cameron later in the day , and I 'd assign their ship a berth on Ashley 's Charm . And the arguments would start again as they tried to get me to go with them . Cameron happens to be the largest minor planet in the outer asteroid belt close enough to the inner edge of the Hague Limit to serve as a port for the transport starships . Her size is not only important to provide enough room for adequate facilities to service the now dozens of ships that arrive and depart from her each week , but also to provide the psychological sense that she is , in fact , a world , with myriad diversions for the travelers to partake of just before beginning the long trek through interstellar space . She has two sister worlds , also ports , spaced around the System . But Cameron is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hyperdrive was the growing kinship of the people of the interstellar age with those of the days of sailing ships . Maximum speed in hyperspace is two light-years per month , so it takes more than two months to get to the nearest star , and most of the interesting worlds are at least a six month 's journey away . Hyperphysics is an interesting thing . One suitable hyperwarp engine can lift even a ship the size of Ashley 's Charm into hyperspace with a rather small amount of energy , but only outside the Hague Limit , which for the Sun is 57.4 astronomical units out . Inside the Hague Limit , two hyperwarp engines can be employed in resonance to provide a marvelous sublight drive , and personal spaceships for trips around the Solar System become more and more common each day . For economic reasons , people like to take their spaceships with them when they get the itch to head out for the stars . For economic reasons dictated by hyperphysics , it 's a lot cheaper to build huge interstellar transport ships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to star . Though on duty when my parents " ship came in , I was able to take a late lunch and meet them at their spaceport berth . I knew Mom and Dad had gotten a new ship last year , but this was my first chance to see it . Their previous ship had been twenty years old when they bought it , but it had served to take my sister and me all over the Solar System . It was n't until I 'd gotten out on my own and moved to Cameron that I actually spent two consecutive years of my life without visiting another world . I had to admit that the folks had picked a nice ship . Big one , too , compared to most of the jobs I was used to slotting onto the transports . A Capitol Products System Sailor , the ship was forty meters long and ten across at the widest , which would leave it with habitable space about the same as a three-bedroom apartment . Miss Michiko was emblazoned across the bow . She was perfect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips with travel times between stops reaching into months . Hence , the big transports for the long journeys . The ship came in smoothly , settled , and I saw Dad wave to me from the pilot bubble . It was only a few minutes more until the hatch slid up and Mom barreled out and launched herself at me . " Joey ! Joey ! " she said , trying to smother me in a hug . " I 'm so glad to see you ! " She pulled back . " What 's that on your face ? You 're not growing a beard , are you ? " She hugged me again . " Your father and I have missed you so much . " " Well , me too , " I heard , and saw my little sister Penny coming down the ramp wearing a stylish blue jumpsuit . I had n't seen her in person in almost five years . She was fifteen when I left . Her hair was still long ; she was a little taller but had much more of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baby sister was a woman now . It was Penny 's turn for a hug and we held each other like-well , like we 'd never held each other . ( I think I gave her a punch on the shoulder when I 'd moved out . ) She gave me a kiss on the cheek then whispered , " I need to talk to you alone . " I only had time to nod that I understood before Dad came out . Dad looked great . Why should n't he ? He was about to do what he 'd always wanted-head out for the stars and begin to see the Universe . The Solar System just was n't big enough for him . Penny and I had learned that very , very early in life . Big and rangy , with the bushy beard I 'd never seen him without , the man weighed in at a hundred kilos and had n't gained nor lost one during my lifetime . He had his hand thrust out , but when I reached for it he slapped my hand away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . God , it 's good to see you . So , you want to come along ? " I was ready for that . " Ca n't . My plants will die , " I said . " Besides , I 'd have to give two-weeks notice and you 'll be gone by then . " " Ho ho , always with the jokes , " Dad said . " But we 'll be here a couple of days , Son . I am going to try to talk you into coming . Besides , do n't you want to be with your sister again ? You have n't seen her in years . She 's growing up without you . " Though Mom and Dad had been out to Cameron a few times since I 'd left home , Penny had always been at school or , later , on an archeological dig ( her passion ) . But I did n't miss that Dad had said " growing up . " Grown up , Dad , I thought . Grown . " Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Afraid not , Mom , " I said . " I have to go back to work . I took a late lunch as it is just to come see you in . " " That 's a shame , " Dad said . " When will you be finished ? " " About three hours from now . Tack on another hour for me to get presentable and I 'll come find you all back here then . In the meantime , I 'll walk with you down to Information and you can take your pick of what you 'd like to see , or maybe get something to eat . This place is quite the cosmic Las Vegas . " " I remember , " Dad said . " Well , I do n't , " Penny said , and as we emerged from the corridor to the central information square , she ran ahead to one of the casino alcoves . I left Mom and Dad there and returned to work . Shannon 's Virtue , sister ship to Ashley 's Charm , was being loaded today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're so large that the mass of any individual ship along for the ride is practically negligible , at least from a safety standpoint . But the proper arrangement of several thousand ships into an efficient mass distribution can still , over the course of a voyage , save the company a couple million credits in operating costs . More than enough to pay loadmasters like me and still have , well , a couple of million credits left over . ( My salary was practically negligible , too . ) The rest of my shift went quickly . I rather liked my job . I 'd started on Cameron as a pilot , flying other people 's ships into their assigned berths on the liners . But I 'm a climber , and first chance I took the test and made it to assistant loadmaster . As a senior loadmaster , I was only one rung on the ladder away from having my own office . I do n't know if Mom and Dad ever understood me . For them , every horizon crossed just egged them on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trading company had made us a wealthy family , and helped to quench some of his thirst for traveling , but once he 'd retired as president , he and Mom were going to be on the go for the rest of their lives . I like the sea of space just as much as they did , but I 'm perfectly content to stop on an island just offshore within sight of the mainland , and make a life for myself there . No way was I going to go with my parents . Just like on the big starship transports , visitors to Cameron have the option of either staying at a room at the spaceport or staying in their ships and using them as apartments . In fact , almost everyone willing to make a star journey buys a ship big enough to serve as home along the way . Although a family-sized spaceship is n't large enough to spend half-year in if you ca n't go outside , on board the big liners they 're just right to serve as home when you have a portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to the berth , Dad showed me around his new ship . " See ? Master bedroom right here for your mother and me . This other room is for Penny , and we have all of her course work loaded in her workstation so she can continue her studies . " " Did you include a sandbox so she can work on her digging skills ? " I asked . " What ? Oh , hah hah . Always with the jokes , you , " he replied then took me up to the control bubble and then insisted on showing me the drive room . Even though I 'd seen thousands of drive rooms and control panels , I muttered the usual comments about how nice and special the ship was . Hell , it was a fine ship , no doubt about it , but hardly novel to someone like me . We went to eat at the Last Exit Saloon , and it was fun to have dinner with the whole family again . " Is there anyone special in your life , Joey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice before when she and Dad had visited , but this time I had more hopeful news . " I think so . Her name is Angela . I would have invited her to eat with us , but she 's at our sister station a hundred twenty degrees around the outer Belt . " " How serious is this ? " Dad wanted to know . " Neither of us is seeing anyone else . I 'd like to keep it that way , " I said . " I guess I wo n't bring up you coming with us again , " Dad said . " I do n't think I can overcome your attitude and a woman 's charms . Congratulations , Son . I hope you make that life for yourself here that you say you want . " He hoisted his wine glass . " To Joey and his future here . " We drank up and I could n't believe how good I felt . Fighting with my folks about my future had been going on since I was fifteen . To have Dad finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unexpected victory . Penny drank the toast with us and smiled , but somehow it seemed to me it was a sad smile . After dessert she said , " Take me dancing , big brother ? " " Dancing ? " Dad exclaimed . " Not me . I 'm beat . You kids go along . Your mom and me will go back to the ship . " Dad never noticed that Penny had n't asked him to come along , but there was n't any reason to point it out . Our folks went their way and Penny and I went ours . " You do n't really want to go dancing , do you ? You just want to talk ? " " Yeah . " " We 'll go to my apartment . " We went through my door and Penny flopped down on my bed . She used to do that when we were kids . " I ca n't go with Mom and Dad . I do n't want to go with Mom and Dad . My life has to be on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bad as all that ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " Because I 'm an archeologist , dammit ! What am I going to dig up on some other planet ? We have n't found another world yet with a civilization on it . The Phinons saw to that . And so what ? I want to figure out what our ancestors were up to , not some other species . " She rolled over onto her stomach . " But it 's no use . Dad is n't going to let me stay . I 'm too young to just up and leave , and I sure ca n't afford school without Mom and Dad 's money . " " But Penny , even if you ca n't get them to agree now , in less than a year you 'll be twenty-one . And you 're already way ahead of your peers . " Penny had finished high school at fifteen , her undergraduate work by nineteen . She was in her second year as a graduate student while most of her friends had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five years her senior , I smiled at the impatience of youth . " You could go with Mom and Dad , finish your course work with them , then come on back after you 're old enough . They know they ca n't stop you forever . You have to remember that you 're the baby of the family . I bet a lot of Dad 's objections have to do with that more than with any rational arguments . I mean , what exactly did he say when you told him you wanted to stay ? " From Penny came a most unexpected and disconcerting pause . " Oh , shit . You did n't tell him anything , did you ? He said you 're all going and you sulked silently while you packed your bags and did n't say a peep to him about staying . " " No , I did n't ! Oh , poop ! I 'm a wimp . I admit it . It 's learned helplessness . I knew that if I said anything he 'd just talk me out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not like you , Joey . Mom and Dad were always proud of you . Even after you said you were leaving , and did , they admired you for it . Dad would make jokes about you fleeing the nest rather than leaving it , but he never sounded like he was bitter or hurt . I think he did the same thing to Grampa himself . " " You think they are n't proud of you ? C'm on , Penny . One of the reasons I left was because I could n't compete with my baby sister . When we were in high school together my teachers used to ask me why I could n't be more like my little sister . I knew you were going to make a huge mark in the world . I do n't begrudge you that . But the last thing I wanted was to be close enough for comparisons to be made . I would have been just a junior executive in Dad 's company while you were making headlines around the world . " " I find it hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to suffer in comparison with me , " Penny said , sounding for all the world just like Dad . Higher voice , but the same choice of words . " OK , no , it was n't just for that . But that was a part of it . I wanted to go and do my own thing and it did n't have anything to do with Dad 's business . I also did n't want him and Mom constantly trying to sell me on the romance of going to the stars and all that . They 're dreamers-I 'm not . But you still have n't answered my question . " " What question ? " " Why does it have to be now ? Why ca n't you go with them for a year ? Our folks are n't getting any younger , you know . And you are their baby . Would it be such a big deal to humor them for one year of your life ? Like I said , you 're way ahead of all your friends in school . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctorate before any of them are done . " " I ca n't go now because there is this really big find that I want to be a part of , " Penny said . I waited but she did n't supply any more details . " Well ? What kind of big find ? " I prompted . " I ca n't tell you that . " " Why the hell not ? " " It 's not just you ; Joey , " Penny said . " I ca n't tell anybody . This is big . This is the biggest thing in archeology ever and the whole crew of us are sworn to absolute secrecy . It involves the Phinons and if Professor Towner found out I told anybody he 'd skin me alive . If this is n't handled right , instead of making our careers , we might just get ourselves ostracized from archeology ! " " How do you get ostracized from- " " It happens , Joey . It happens . You do n't find what you 're supposed to find and the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . Dr. Towner says he 's so far out on a limb right now as it is that it might break all by itself even if we do everything right . " I could n't get any more out of her about the find . Everyone has heard about the Phinons . We defeated them in a war a century back , and the hyperdrive came out of that war . But the Phinons never came inside Hague Limits unless it was to wipe out civilizations just getting close to star travel . They dwelt among the cometary haloes and they 'd been doing it for about a billion years . I did n't know what in the world one could dig up on Earth that would have anything to do with Phinons , and press as I might , Penny would n't tell me . " OK , OK , " I said , giving up the interrogation . " But the bottom line is that we have to try to convince Dad to let you stay but we ca n't tell him why it is you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why you ca n't just take a year off same as I wondered . " How to convince Dad ? I did n't have a clue as I went to work tte next morning , though Dad was going to be coming up to the station to see just what it was I did now ( I 'd had different , better , jobs each time my folks had visited ) . Still , it made me feel good to " play " the big brother for Penny as well as just being one . The control station is a big sphere atop the main tower . Though it can be made transparent , when we 're working the interior of the sphere is all projection , and though we stay safely on the surface of Cameron , it looks like we 're flying through space . My way to travel ! I was figuring out assignments for the loading of Ashley 's Charm when it occurred to me that maybe the best thing to do was just to show Dad how successful I was becoming on my own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same chance . I had doubts about it working , though . Promising to help and being able to are very different things . I had Ashley 's Charm about a third loaded before Dad showed up . The first third is always the easiest-we load up the tail end with all the smaller ships which pretty much all mass the same and so there 's very little jiggering around to do . Dad walked into the globe and gave that most satisfying double-take that people do when they come out of the dark elevator and find themselves apparently floating kilometers out in space . He stared around , taking everything in , and I knew I 'd just gone up in his estimation simply by virtue of where I work . " Boy , Joey , I can see why you like your job , so much . I could get used to this pretty fast myself , " he said . " It is magnificent , " I admitted . " Look over there , Dad . Our pilots are just starting to berth some of the bigger ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as Dad 's was positioning itself for insertion into the landing bay , looking like a gnat preparing to land on an elephant . " Wow ! Is the owner piloting that boat , or is one of your guys doing it ? " " One of our guys , always , " I said . " But I was hoping to dock Miss Michiko myself . " " Sorry , Pop . Our insurance wo n't cover it . It 's not only your ship we have to worry about , it 's the liner , too . If we let a thousand different owners do their own docking , how long do you think it would be before one of them blew it ? I trained for months before I got to berth my first tiny launch . And I do n't even want to think about the possibility of some terrorist deliberately flying his boat into the liner . " " Why would anyone want to do that ? " " Not everyone loves the stars like you do , Dad . There are plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . They think the Phinons and the Hague Limit are God 's quarantine . " " Nuts , " Dad said . I was n't sure if he meant the people I was characterizing or if he was just disappointed at not getting to berth his own boat . " I 'm glad you realized that I 'm not like you and Mom , Dad . I was afraid when you told me you were going to stop here it was to try to get me to go along . " Even as I said it , I felt I was being entirely transparent . I wanted to segue into Penny 's situation , but I was half afraid Dad was suddenly going to say , " Penny 's going and that 's it . " But he did n't . " That 's OK , Son . Mom and I knew you were different very early on . You never wanted to go on trips , even when you were a little kid . You completely ignored my science fiction books . That 's one of the reasons we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have better luck the second time around . " Then he turned to look at me , both smiling and serious . " You do realize I 'm joking , do n't you ? Your mother and I are proud of you . " " I know . But how was Penny so much different from me ? " " Oh , we knew immediately that she was like us . Penny always wanted to go along . You could n't take a walk with her without her wanting to round just one more curve or look over just one more hill . She always needed to see what was on the other side of the horizon . Problem with her was that Mom and Dad always had to come along . If she 'd gotten a little more of your independence and you a little more of her romantic streak .... he trailed off . " What ? " " Then I 'd have somebody else 's children . Anyway , your Mom and I could n't love either of you any more than we do . " " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say is that Penny is studying to be an archeologist . Does she really want to interrupt her studies to see the stars ? " " She 's young , Joey . She has lots of time to finish up . She 's years ahead of her friends . Besides , she has n't said a word to us about not going along . I mentioned she could probably continue her class work on the ship and she went right out looking for study files to take along . " No , Joey , you 're reading your own feelings into your sister . She 's not a little girl anymore . I find it hard to believe that if she did n't want to go , she would n't have said something . " At that point I knew there was nothing else I could say to Dad to convince him that Penny wanted to remain behind . Penny was either going to have to tell him herself before tomorrow morning or she was going to the stars . Later that day Miss Michiko was flown up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted on being aboard when she went up . I had a chance to tell Penny that I 'd gotten nowhere with Dad during his visit to the control center before she and Mom went shopping one last time , passing the time while waiting for Dad to return on the shuttle from Ashley 's Charm . I was too busy to give the issue much more thought , anyway . I knew I 'd be supportive of Penny tonight at our parting dinner , but my saying anything would depend upon whether or not she found it in herself to tell Dad she wanted to stay . She had n't been too good at that yet . I had just come off shift and was heading back to my apartment to clean up before dinner when I ran into Mom and Penny . " Is Dad 's shuttle in yet ? " Mom asked . " It was just getting ready to leave Ashley 's Charm when I left the control center , " I told her . " Dad should be down in about ten minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " What 'd you get , Penny ? " She took it out of the bag . It was a toy-an action figure , of a slim , monstrous thing with arms and legs that bent the wrong way . She held it out to me . " Why did you buy a toy Phinon ? " I asked , taking it from her . " I asked her that , too , " Mom said . " That toy costs three times as much out here as it does insystem . " " I bought it for inspiration , " Penny said , taking it back and slipping it into her bag . " Either that , or as a reminder . " " Reminder of what ? " Mom asked . Penny just smiled . Mom and Penny went to meet Dad at the shuttle dock , and I went to clean up , promising to meet them at dinner in half an hour . I showered , looked in the mirror , then shaved off the beard I 'd started to surprise Angela . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , maybe because she had , she liked me looking well-scrubbed and clean-shaven , and she was n't going to see me again for at least a couple of years . On the way to dinner it began to sink in that this time it was my folks who were leaving me behind . I had only fled the nest for another branch on the same tree , but they were heading to an entirely different forest . The family was already seated when I arrived , and just about to have their orders taken . I slid into the seat to Dad 's right . He finished talking to the waiter then said , " Hello , Joey . You were right about the piloting . That berth is kind of narrow . I 'm glad I did n't have to try to fly into it myself . " Dad was buying . I ordered first and I went for the steak and lobster . We grow our own lobsters on Cameron so they do n't cost that much more than on Earth , but even if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cheap . In fact , Dad also ordered the steak and lobster , Mom got the chicken , and Penny ordered the vegetarian salad . " Is that all you 're having ? " Dad asked . " It looks like a pretty big salad , " she replied . Penny is n't a vegetarian , but you can pick at a salad for a long time without actually eating much of it . She was nervous about the showdown with Dad , I was sure . Nervousness always killed her appetite . At exam time she used to live on water and air . It was a fun meal during the main course . We recalled fond memories of trips we 'd taken as a family . " Remember when we flew through the rings of Saturn ? " " How about the hiking we did on Miranda ? " " My favorite was the skiing trip to Titan . " Dad talked about their coming trip to the stars . " First stop , Tau Ceti , and the sunny seas of Tropic , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even leave . " " What ? And not see what 's at the next star ? Hah ! " I said . " You have your old man pegged , " Dad laughed . " The Universe is the limit . And after we finish with this Galaxy , there 's a bundle of others to see . " He raised his glass . " To the final frontier , " he toasted , and we all , even Penny , clinked glasses . We were well into dessert and I was wondering if Penny would say anything at all when it finally happened . We were just making small talk and Dad said , " I hope you do n't miss the three of us too bad while we 're gone , " when Penny put down her spoon and said : " Dad , I ca n't go . " No preamble . No indication it was coming . No distant sound of thunder to warn of coming storms . Just a bolt from the blue . " Dad , I ca n't go . " Dad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth , just stopped halfway there and then returned to the plate . I do n't know what I expected him to say . I knew he would n't just blow up . If it was anything like my breaking-away time , the blow-up would n't happen until after the calm discussion had escalated into an argument and Dad realized he was losing . But it was Mom who went first . " What 's the matter , honey ? What 's wrong ? " " I just ca n't go . " " Do n't you think you could have brought this up a little sooner ? " Dad finally asked . " Daddy , I 'm sorry . I really am . I should have said something before . I should have told you before we left . But . . I just ca n't go . " " Well , why not ? " Penny was ready for that . " My work on Earth is at a critical point . And more than that , Dr. Towner is sitting on the biggest find of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to be a part of this . It will make my career . It will make everyone 's career . It will rewrite our entire understanding of human history , she said , and as her thoughts turned to her work , her conf dence soared . " Oh , really ? Big as all that , huh ? " Dad said , and I could hear the sarcasm coming . " So immensely huge that you waited until we were an hour away from going to the stars before bringing it up . Why was that , Penny ? " The confidence went away . She looked into her plate . Very softly : " Because I was afraid . " " Afraid of what ? " " Afraid of you . " " Why ? " " Now , Father- , " Mom started to interrupt . " No , let her answer Dad said , cutting Mom off . " If Penny wants to stay behind and fend for herself , she 'd damn well better start speaking for herself . " Now , Penny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , was lending my moral support by eating my dessert quietly . " I said that wrong , " Penny continued . " I 'm not afraid of you , Dad . I was afraid of disappointing you . I know you've. . . you and Mom , I mean . . have always counted on me being the one that 's like both of you . You know , always looking over the next horizon . I knew the minute you brought up the star trip that you 'd just assume I 'd love to go as much as you and Mom . I knew all you were thinking about was whether or not you could convince Joey to go . " " Good thing that 's all settled , " I interjected , not wanting it to come up again as an issue . " No . I knew I 'd ask Joey , maybe even try to pressure him a bit . But I never expected I 'd succeed . I know my children better than that . At least I thought I did . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always " wanted to go . " So now I 'm mystifiedwhy do n't you want to go over this next horizon with your Mom and me ? " Right around then I noticed that the spoon I 'd been lifting to my mouth kept coming up empty , so I set it down and started playing with my napkin instead . " Because there 's another horizon I want to cross , " Penny answered . " What ? There 's some boy back on Earth ? One of your archeology buddies ? " I knew what " horizon " Dad was thinking about . " No-oooo . . . time ! The horizon of time , Daddy . Geez , boys are a plentiful commodity . I 'm surprised you even said that ! " Penny 's disgust was evident ( though likely feigned ) . " OK , great , fine . So it really is this big dig you 're on . You should have brought this up before . So just what is it that you 've found that 's so important that it ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it 's so great , the dig will be going on for years . " " But I want to be there for the announcement , Dad . I want my face next to Towner 's on the news . " " But what is the find ? " Dad persisted as I knew he would . " If I do n't know all the facts , then I ca n't make a decision . You 're still a minor and we 're still your parents . . . " ( That was Dad , including Mom as a rhetorical equal in his decision . But they 'd been married for thirty years by then , so who was I to say anything ? ) " . . so if you 're going to stay behind , I , we , have to have a good reason why . " Penny was silent for a long time . Everyone was silent . I certainly was n't going to say anything . Penny drew a deep breath . " I ca n't tell you , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we all promised . . . that I would n't tell anyone about the find . The significance will be obvious once we go public , but before then . . . No , I ca n't tell you , Daddy . " If you ca n't let me stay without knowing . . . " and she let out a big sigh , . . . then I 'll just have to go . " Penny stayed . Sure , she 'd played the martyr . Sure , Penny had put on for effect . But she was being honest , of that we 'd had no doubt , and somehow in our years apart she had cultivated a nobility that I knew I 'd never match . That last meal had been an allaround family epiphany . I 'd love to be able to say Dad cheerfully relented when Penny so self-sacrificially stood her ground , but the fact is he grumbled and groaned and complained the whole time while he went to send a message to Rodney ( the man now in charge of Dad 's company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . " We could have put a big entertainment center in your room if you 'd just spoken up , " he told Penny . " Damn workstation in there cost a fortune , " he muttered . But it was that he let her stay that counted , and Penny stood beside me on Carver 's Peak as we watched Ashley 's Charm depart . You all know what happened . Five months later the news broke . The archeologist Towner and his crew of graduate students had found , underneath a seventy-thousand-yearold layer of lava , the remains of an alien base . Absolute evidence that somewhere in the Universe another species had survived the Phinons and achieved star travel . Penny 's face was right next to Towner 's on all the news shows . A month after that word came from Tau Ceti that Ashley 's Charm had failed to arrive , though three months later still a debris cloud from the right direction showered the star system . No one ever figured out what happened . Malfunction ? Phinons ? The debris yielded up no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead . I mentioned earlier that I sometimes wonder if my parents ever understood me . Now I wonder if I ever understood them . In reading back through this I notice how Mom seems to play such a minor role . It was n't really like that through our lives together , but at that time and in that place , it was the ultimate relationship of a father with his children that had to be sorted out . During those last days together , Dad behaved in a way that , I now see , was typically Dad , though at the time Penny and I had misread him entirely . Penny is " Doctor Penny " now , and she runs her own digs . Another alien site was discovered near Olympus Mons on Mars last year . She was terribly excited . Penny and I inherited the family fortune , but I still work and I 'm chief loadmaster with my own office now . Though all the passengers on Ashley 's Charm were declared dead , I sometimes wonder if that 's true . Ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not balanced for hyperflight , they had sufficient power to propel the ships to near-light velocity . Could the passengers have known what was coming ? Could they have fled Ashley 's Charm before the calamity ? Could Mom and Dad be on their way back home ? Small ships do not carry hyperwaves , nor radios capable of transmitting billions of kilometers , so no word would have come from Miss Michiko . But it would have made far more sense for Dad to have gone on to Tau Ceti if he and Mom had somehow survived . Still , I like to go up on Carver 's Peak and watch the big ships come in . But now I look for little ones , too . We welcome your letters , which should be sent to Analog , 1270 Avenue of the Americas , New York , NY 10020 . ( CompuServe : 71154,662 .
