BIKES AND BUGGIES OWN THE ROAD IN PENNSYLVANIA 'S LANCASTER COUNTY * BY DON CUERDON Photograph Life is still plain and simple in Lancaster County . // From above , the roads of Lancaster County spread across the rolling farmland of southeastern Pennsylvania like varicose veins . And , like their anatomical counterparts , they do n't see much action because the closest artery is far away . Lancaster 's roads were laid down well before the automobile was born , so they meander from farm to farm and from farm to market along grades best suited to hoof and foot power . Most of these quiet byways have never been upgraded beyond receiving a coat of macadam , because Lancaster is still a stronghold for the Amish ( see sidebar ) . And the Amish still do n't drive cars . You 'll see more hooves , feet , bicycles ( and far fewer internal combusters ) on these roads than most anywhere else in this country . That 's the nutshell version of why Lancaster County is one of the best places on earth for bicycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How about farm stands every few miles , chock full of organic fruit and veggies ? How about plenty to keep the noncyclists in your family happy ? There 's factory  --  outlet , Amish-quilt , and **26;1095;TOOLONG shopping ; amusement parks and other adventures for the kiddies ; interesting places to stay , such as working farms where you can help with the chores ; and restaurants that serve down-on-the-farmsize portions . ( Hint : Always ask about foods you do n't recognize , because there is no " apple " in scrapple . ) But the real attraction is the riding . Ca n't afford Europe ? The narrow lanes , stone farmhouses and barns abutting the roadways make Lancaster hard to discern from a European countryside . And on any Sunday you can expect to see the horsedrawn buggies of Amish and Mennonite families off to worship and socialize . When you pass , a smile and a wave is n't uncommon . Non-combusters are kin no matter where you 're from .

A Sidebar Who Are the Pennsylvania Dutch ? They 're not Dutch , that 's for sure . The Amish settlers of Lancaster County spoke Deutsch-that 's German for " German " - which could be the source of the original confusion . But they were n't from Germany , either . The very first Amish ( named after ultra-ultra-conservative farmer , Jacob Amman ) were a group of Swiss Mennonites , preceded by the Anabaptists who split with the Protestant Reformation over adult versus infant baptism . Since then , the Amish have built a culture around spirituality , fellowship , simplicity and unworldliness . To preserve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by horse and buggy , do n't have electricity or televisions , and do n't mix with outsiders . Two places you 'll never see the Amish : In the passing lane of an interstate highway , or in church . ( They worship in each other 's homes and barns . ) A related group , the Mennonites , who are not quite as austere as the Amish , also live in Lancaster .
