Biologists , unlike physicists , are unaccustomed to gargantuan , gazillion- dollar research projects . So when American geneticists embarked on a $3 billion effort to map out all the hereditary information found on the 23 pairs of human chromosomes , they decided , like the proverbial tortoise , to take the slow and careful route . Plotting out a 12-year game plan , the geneticists subdivided the work among nine different laboratories so that eventually the scientists could pool their results in one highly detailed chart . Along the way , they have been trying to patent their discoveries , even before knowing precisely what their importance was . <P> But they did not count on the harelike speed  --  and less mercenary mind-set  --  of Daniel Cohen . An ambitious French geneticist , he has jumped ahead of his American rivals and is close to completing the first map of the human genome . <P> Cohen and his colleagues at the Center for the Study of Human Polymorphism in Paris will soon unveil their pioneering cartography . Thanks to a series of clever shortcuts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schedule U.S. scientists set for themselves . Though somewhat rudimentary , Cohen 's charts will make it easier for researchers to track down and isolate single genes scattered along the length of human chromosomes . " We do n't want to say that we have beaten the Americans , " the 41-year-old geneticist protests . " We like to compete , but not on a nationalistic basis . " And yet he notes , " On this map , 90% of the work will have been done in France . " <P> The U.S. government has tacitly acknowledged the French achievement by awarding researchers at M.I.T. $24 million to adopt Cohen 's techniques . But the American effort has yet to emulate the most admirable aspect of the French effort : Cohen intends to donate his gene map to the United Nations as a gift to the world , thereby ensuring all scientists unrestricted access to the vital data . Cohen feels he owes this to the public because his work has been largely funded by public donations to a muscular-dystrophy telethon . <P> The federally funded U.S. project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted a campaign to patent each DNA fragment that its researchers can reproduce , even before its usefulness is determined . The policy has been heavily criticized within scientific circles and figured in the abrupt resignation last spring of Nobel-prizewinning geneticist James Watson as head of the Genome Project . Cohen speaks for many critics when he names the two big problems with the NIH approach : " The first is moral . You ca n't patent something that belongs to everyone . It 's like trying to patent the stars . The second is economic . By patenting something without knowing the use of it , you inhibit industry . This could be a catastrophe . " <P> The initial maps under construction on both sides of the Atlantic will not identify every gene on every chromosome . Instead , the maps describe fragments of DNA arranged in the proper order as they would appear on the chromosomes . So far , researchers have identified a few genetic markers on each fragment : for example , the gene for Huntington 's disease on a fragment of chromosome 4 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each gene  --  a code that is written in chemical constituents called base pairs . The great challenge is the sheer size of the task . The human genome contains 3.5 billion base pairs .
