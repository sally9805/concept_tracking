<p> Two hundred times a year , the earth shifts , usually imperceptibly , below cities and towns stretching from Cairo , Ill. , to Marked Tree , Ark . <p> But one man 's prediction of a major earthquake - of at least 6.5 on the Richter scale - on Monday or close to it , has dramatically affected the 33 million people in striking distance of the New Madrid ( pronounced MAD-rid ) fault . <p> The prediction by climatologist Iben Browning has been publicly scoffed at by experts . To no avail . In the seven states along this town 's namesake fault , and even in the states beyond , disaster plans are in the works and foreboding , fear - even panic - is in the air . <p> " A lot of people will be sitting on pins and needles waiting for the earth to shake , " says Stephen Renfro , director of the county 's health clinic . <p> Up to 40,000 students are being let out of school Monday - and that 's just in Missouri . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quake insurance is selling and many residents are fleeing the area . <p> In White Bluff , Tenn. , Mayor Lawrence Brown has even canceled the town 's Christmas parade , planned for Sunday . <p> " I 'm the joke of the community right now , " says Brown . " But let it be . I 'd rather have that happen than have a bunch of power lines fall on kids or have gas lines start popping . " <p> A big quake could be much worse than that . Studies done for the Federal Emergency Management Agency say the area - site of three monster quakes in 1811-12 - is ripe for a new disaster . <p> Major cities like Memphis , Little Rock , Ark. , and Evansville , Ind. , are built on soft soil that could literally liquify in a temblor . Brick buildings could collapse . Roads could buckle . The Mississippi could flood . Damage could exceed $ 50 billion . <p> If the quake happens at night , when people are home , hundreds could die , the FEMA study says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in high rises , 5,000 could . <p> That is why people are afraid . <p> " People are gullible , " says Carl Bender , professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis . " There is a real panic on , and in a panic people are willing to believe the most outrageous things . " <p> Outrageous is one of the kinder things scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey are saying about Browning these days . While they agree that the New Madrid is due for a major quake sometime in the next 30 years , they 've called his day-specific prediction bunk , and worse . <p> The reason Browning is focusing on Monday - his exact prediction is Monday or 48 hours on either side of that day - is because that 's when tidal forces will reach a 60-year high for much of the Northern Hemisphere . That will " pull the trigger " on earthquakes and volcanoes around the world , he says . <p> Browning , 72 , claims to have predicted last year 's 7.1 California earthquake , though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time as a consultant for businesses , predicting how weather trends will affect crops and companies . <p> But here in New Madrid , the USA 's oldest city west of the Mississippi River , the most fearsome consequence of his prediction is at the end of Main Street . There , a great levee holds back the Mississippi . In a major quake , it could burst . <p> Others are looking over their shoulders , too : <p> - In Arkansas , earthquake drills are slated for Dec. 1-5 . " You have never seen the kind of damage we are going to be faced with , " says Office of Emergency Service official Dan Cicirello . <p> - At least 1,600 members of the Kentucky National Guard are on call . " We will be standing by breathlessly , " says Adjutant Gen. Michael Davidson . <p> - In St. Louis , meetings , conventions and conferences scheduled to start this weekend have been canceled . Residents are booking flights out of town . <p> - In Evansville , the Quake Master gas shutoff valve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the flow of natural gas into buildings after a quake . Browning is " throwing darts at a calendar but I bless his heart for doing it , " says company owner Frank Cici , who 's sold 400 valves already . <p> - In Collinsville , Ill. , trucker Robert Mathis is trying to prepare but , " My house is brick and they tell me that 's the first to fall down . ... I 'm trying to secure a few things , but that 's it . If the earth underneath your house crumbles , you ca n't tell me you can do anything about it . " <p> Even those out of the fault-zone are worried . Schools in northern Alabama are n't taking chances . They 've added earthquake drills to daily routines . In Louisiana , officials are concerned about oil and chemical spills from plants upstream in St. Louis . <p> " Look at the map , " says U.S. Army Reserve Col. Ray Pendleton . " They 're looking at a shake-and-break ... so spectacular that it 's blinded them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's natural that things flow downriver . " <p> The frenzied reaction upsets people like Douglas Wiens , seismologist at Washington University : <p> " I 'm worried about this sort of hysterical tone that 's come out ... because it 's completely ridiculous . " <p> Others think massive attention from the media has fueled the problem . In New Madrid , it has sometimes seemed absurd . <p> William Clark , owner of Tom 's Grill , decided Tuesday how much to charge a Peoria , Ill. , radio station that wants to broadcast from his restaurant : a steep $ 200 for three hours . <p> Says Clark : " I think they 'll be disappointed . They 're not going to see any shaking . ... Probably what will happen is we 'll all get settled down and it 'll happen in a year . " <p> But no one 's betting the farm . <p> " We 're believers , " says waitress Ginger Wasem of Collinsville , who 'll head to Wisconsin in early December - with 10 family members . <p> " We take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . <p> Francis Payne , who has lived in Marianna , Ark. , for 75 years , is using the trunk of her car and several rooms in her house to stash medication , food and water . She even got a utility worker to come out to show her how to turn off the natural gas . <p> People in the smaller communities , like this one , know it 'll be neighbor- helping-neighbor if there is a big quake . Disaster relief will go first to cities like St. Louis and Memphis , where casualties could be high . <p> " We 're prepared for the worst , " says Chris Henry , emergency management planner for New Madrid . The town has spent close to $ 6,000 on emergency supplies for its 3,300 residents in case of a quake . <p> Still , New Madrid is short on equipment , manpower and money , and has crammed what should have been three years of planning into three months . <p> " If it does happen we 'll be without help for awhile , " says Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Dick Phillips , who refused to cancel Monday night 's regular City Council meeting , has a more stoic approach . <p> " We accept this fault as a way of life , " he says . " It 's been here , and it 'll be here when we 're dead and gone .
