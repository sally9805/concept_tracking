" Open your mouth ! " the bandit leader ordered . Abraham closed his eyes , opened his mouth wide , and waited for the metal gun barrel that would break his teeth and the slug that would slice through his brain . But instead of that , he only felt two rough , warm fingers smelling of Samna and sage , the ashes of bonfires , and rifle oil touching his lips , spreading his jaws , and poking into his mouth . Under his tongue , the bandit put a heavy gold coin and kissed him on both cheeks . Then he gave him a big block of dried dates , a new stick , and a striped cloak , sat him on a horse , and the whole gang rode behind him for a long stretch , for two days , until they came out of the mountains into the plain and Abraham asked them to leave him , for he did n't want to come to his beloved surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , he went first to the home of the mukhtar , Yakir Alhadef , a sharp , fat Bulgarian Jew with his thumbs permanently stuck in his belt . " What is your desire ? " asked Alhadef . " Arrange me a match with the maiden Sarah Nazaroff , " said Abraham . Alhadef almost choked with laughter and amazement . " You do n't need a matchmaker , " he told Father . " The poor converts would give their daughter to a monkey if he was a Jew of the seed of Our Father Abraham . She does n't even want to go to school , the filly " Then he grew serious . " Hey , you 're one of us , why do you go to them ? " he asked . " There are n't any virgins in Jerusalem ? " But Abraham assumed the blank countenance of one firmly in love , and Alhadef , understanding that his guest saw and heard nothing but the reflections of his own imagination , rose and took him to the Nazaroff house . The old convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table . Sarah was serving water , bread , vegetables , and cheese . She pierced Abraham with lowered gazes and aromas of rain that would never dry . His flesh melted . She had now turned sixteen and had n't changed a bit since he had seen her three years before , for she had continued growing up in his dreams too . He controlled the trembling in his knees and contented himself , I imagine , with a small smile full of honor . Mikhail Nazaroff asked how he was and questioned him about his occupation and his family , and Abraham answered every one of his queries with a detailed and respectful reply ,  | though he knew the old convert had already decided to give him his daughter for a wife . But before he and Alhadef left the house , the brother suddenly approached with his mighty body , bent down , and said quietly into his truly terrified ear , " You be nice to Sarah , or you better watch out . We are Tartars ! " And he went on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family in Tiberias , the " good people " who had taken him in on his return from the war ; he brought them regards from their relatives in Jerusalem and spent about ten days with them . He stayed in the Alhadef home another week , until all the necessary preparations were completed and Rabbi Joseph Abulafia came from Tiberias , tied up his donkey in the converts ' stable , and married my parents in the courtyard of the village school . After the ceremony the young couple withdrew to the room prepared for them in the Nazaroff house . For a whole hour they lay next to one another , throbbing with love and yearnings this first encounter could n't assuage , and then my mother got up from the bed and led my father to the field . Terrified and barefoot , he walked behind her , the soles of his feet recoiling from the clods and thorns . Her white nightgown showed him the way , her hair gleamed in the darkness , and as they lay on the ground embracing , as her body gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father suddenly began weeping . Neither a weeping of joy nor a weeping of love , but the weeping of men when their first child is born . " Weeping that draws tears out of the bones , " as Mother would say years later , whenever she recalled it . That night my father touched her with his eyes , heard her with his breast , saw her with the palms of his hands , and at sunrise , when he was awakened by the singing of warblers and the dews of the cold earth , he found her lying behind him , his body cupped in the hollow between her chest and thighs , her breath warming the back of his neck , one hand supporting his cheek , and the other covering his rib cage and his heart .  | who am I ? " I was born at Blunderstone , in Suffolk , or thereby , ' as they say in Scotland . I was a posthumous child . My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . My father was a gentle , easy-going person . He owned a luxurious hotel on the Riviera . " " My name was Tommy Stubbins , son of Jacob Stubbins , the cobbler of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh . " " My poor father owned the firm of Engelbert Krull . " " Never was there real peace between me and father . He seemed to treat me harshly from the moment I was born . " Nearsightedness thrust me into the arms of memory and reading . There , among the pages , I discovered clearly drawn people , comprehensible ambivalence , and the horizon that is never blurry , the one that stretches behind the eyes , not in front of them . Even today , I impress my interlocutors with quotations from Dickens and Melville , Tschernikhovski and Hoffmann , Vasari and Saroyan , Nabokov and Fielding . But friends I did n't find among their lines . " For what do we seek among the pages of books if not the sight of our own face ? " wondered Robert Louis Stevenson . It was Jules Verne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell and little to say , who introduced me to Marfa and Nadia , showed me the image of the mother and the features of the beloved . But , even then , tears did n't come to my eyes . " Si vis me Here , " said Horace to the novice poet : " If you would have me weep , begin the strain , / Then I shall feel your sorrows , feel your pain . " I suspect all those writers never weep . The big , fair girl filled the little room with a good smell of milk and field . Quiet prevailed . Between Bulisa Levy 's fat knees , damp husks of watermelon seeds piled up on a rag .  | " ' Tfu-hamsa-mezuza , " she finally exclaimed . " ' That 's the woman , Abra-li:uiC That 's the bride of your dreams you brought us ? ( ' ; very one of her dresses will cost twice as much . With the fabric well buy for that one , you could clothe a whole family . " " The first word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in years to come , staining her memories with anger and accusations . " They did n't want me there . Only the Duduch , she loved me . " ' Ha Duduch was about fifteen years old then . She looked at her new sister-in-law and was breathless with admiration . Mother 's good smell , her strength , the rippling muscles under the white skin of her arms  --  all stirred love and longing in the girl . Sarah , who was only a year older than Duduch , smiled at her shyly and surveyed the room in astonishment . She was a simple girl , a gooseherd who could n't read or write , and now her eyes opened wide , trying to take in more and more . In her father 's house moldy hues of brown , gray , and black prevailed ; here a colorful carpet was spread on the floor , embroidered cloths and gleaming cushions adorned the sofas . Two big ironclad pashas to hold bedclothes stood against the wall , and a canoon of coals glowed red in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splotches of moisture on the walls , the empty oil cans that propped up the sofas , or the patches on the upholstery . A large mirror hung on the wall , with two wings that reflected the other side of whoever looked into it . Sarah , who until that day had seen her face only in the small hand mirror of the principal of the village school , and her full body only in the serenity of big puddles of rainwater , approached the mirror curiously , saw that her goose was still clutched in her arms , and immediately became embarrassed and let go of him . The goose panicked , beat his mighty wings , and smashed the mirror into thousands of slivers . A shout came from Bulisa Levy 's mouth . Terrified , Sarah knelt down and began gathering up the sharp glass splinters of her reflection . Duduch sank down beside her to help , and their bleeding fingers quickly began touching one another . When they finished , she smiled and offered Mother roasted chestnuts , almonds , and hot , sweet wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother hurried after him . " There are things that will never mix , Abraham , " she said to him through the wooden wall of the common toilet . " A cat and a dog do n't mix . An orange and spinach do n't mix . And us and those do n't mix . " In her terms , " they " were the arrogant leaders of her own community , and " those " were all the foreigners . Abraham , squatting on the trapper , moved his bowels and did n't answer , but his mother knew that lines of  | dread and distress were etched on his mortified fact. , Slit ? raised her voice so all the neighbor women could hear and remember what slit . said . " When I see white ravens , you will have it good with that woman . She is n't your rib , Abraham , she will only bring trouble on us . " At night she and Duduch slept in one bed , Abraham and Sarah in the other . " And what did the cabailla bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the dowry her daughter-in-law had brought . She knew everyone was lying there in bed and no one was sleeping . I Icr voice sawed the darkness of the room : " Big as a mare , white as a sick sheet , and breaks everything she touches . " The next morning the rest of the necessary facts were delivered to the women of the courtyard , by evening the whole Jewish Quarter knew , and it took two more days for Jerusalem to fabricate all the rest . The coloring , the eyes , and the gait of the gigantic girl stirred the gossips and filled their mouths to bursting . More than once , the female relatives said , she was seen crossing herself at the table . During her menstrual period , the neighbors huffed , she isolated herself in a locked room and received her food through the window like one of the Karaite women . On Dia de banyo , the old women spluttered , right after she came back from the mihve , she pushed Abraham to the floor and rode him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts to the world . The gossip filled the courtyard and overflowed it , sloshed along with the filth of the sewers and preceded the victim wherever she went . Winter came in her wake , and with it the thin , stinging Jerusalem rain , the wind that erupts from the burrows of the city , and the cold that pukes out of the crevices of her walls . All summer the stones emitted dust , and now the rain swept it away in turgid , frozen streams that clogged the alleys . The lizards crept off to the desert , the little songbirds migrated to Jericho , and only the big ravens in the pines of the Armenian Quarter remained in the city , flying across her skies and shrieking ancient abuse in all the languages their forefathers had learned from the soldiers and pilgrims . A year after she came to Jerusalem , Sarah gave birth to a big , handsome daughter . The midwife put a wedge of wood between her teeth , and all through the delivery a wet spot on the ceiling dripped water onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cistern filled up , and the burning embers whispered in the canoon . The little girl had marvelous blue eyes , long , sturdy legs without a single fold of baby fat , and a devil 's coat of fine red fur that covered her whole body . The red mantle of hair frightened the entire Jewish Quarter , especially Abraham , who was  | calmed neither by Elijah 's genetic explanations nor by the declaration of Dr. Korkidi , who had returned that year from medical school in Paris : " It falls off ! " He heard the whispering about the creatura he had sired , and believed his mother was right . " Then I understood it was all a mistake . That my mother of blessed memory was right . White ravens never come , oil and water never mix , a bull and a donkey do n't plow together . " But Sarah loved her little daughter dearly , for beneath her red down the baby had her coloring and proportions , and to Sarah she was n't only a ( laughter but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her back with a sheet , and carried her like Arab peasant women do , not parting from her for i single moment . When she nursed her , she recounted all her suffering , and when the baby was four months old and died in her cradle , all Jerusalem trembled with her awful lament , which held the terrible keening of mountain wolves , the dread of winter winds among the folds , and the stunned bleating of the slaughterhouse . " She made noises like a beast . " Father dredged up a rare memory . In my childhood , when I asked him about our older sister , he usually denied her existence , scowled mightily in refusal , pretended to be deaf , and finally , when I persisted , offered to make silhouettes on the wall for me . Only many years later , in one of his letters to me in the United States , did he write that " your mother " lay in bed for a week with the tiny corpse , shouting " Not to the Olives . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goose did n't let anyone approach , " and it was lucky it was winter and her little one did n't stink . " In the end , Dr. Korkidi kicked the goose , entered the room , stroked Sarah 's hair , and persuaded her , putting his two small warm hands on her wet temples . She held his wrists , got out of bed , and let Jacob Parnas the gravedigger come in and take her daughter to her grave . Parnas 's mother purified the infant , swaddled her in a shroud , and tied the little corpse , which was hard as a rock , to the wooden board used for carrying dead infants ; and Jacob Parnas bore it on his broad shoulders to the children 's section on the Mount of Olives . That was how they buried children in those days , in the most horrible of funerals , the funeral of a dead child no one accompanies out of fear and guilt , who has no name carved on the tombstone . Like a public judgment , the child 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah , and now Abraham 's soul was pierced too . Chenou Apari , a woman I 'll tell you about when her time comes , said a long time later that you do n't kill love with a sword . Oh no ! You torment love with pinpricks . And love never dies . Jamais ! It only shouts , does love , and crumbles , and melts , but never does it cease to exist .  | 0 n days when her suffering overflowed its banks , Sarah would run away and seek an open field to breathe in , grasses to wallow in . To smell flowers , " she said , to smell flowers and sec trees . " Barren fields and rocks stretched around the city , and the few neighborhoods outside its walls looked like tiny frightened islands floating and drifting on wasteland and boulders . Sometimes she would go out Nablus Gate and walk past Mea Shearim . To the northeast , a small lake had been forming all winter , reeds crowned it , toads sang its hymns , stray storks landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garden of Antimos to peep through the stone wall at the orchard and the villas , and I imagine that was where she first saw the Greek Patriarch 's carriage . Then she hastened to Ganjiria , where houses were just springing up in those days , and beyond she discovered the valley that became her shelter and refuge . She would call the goose , go out Jaffa Gate , pass Spinney 's general store , and look in to say hello to Elijah Nathan , because she knew that Duduch dreamed of him ; from there she walked along the Moslem cemetery , with its pervasive stench of stagnant water ; with frightened step she ran up the path at the mouth of the ancient cave , for an old lion lived in its depths and guarded the skeletons of the righteous that had fallen apart , and to this day no one knows how to put them back together . Panting , she reached the ridge of the hill where the Franciscans built their new college . To the side stood a marble Virgin with bent head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift her to the roof . Opposite was a windmill , and next to it the pioneer stonecutters were building the first houses of the Rehavia neighborhood . They were sure that Sarah was only a Russian pilgrim in local clothing , and they talked about her in Hebrew . When they saw her blush and realized that she understood ,  | one of them stood up and invited her to share their lunch , but Sarah got scared and took off . I sometimes think she might have done well to respond to that fellow , who might have loved her with a love worthy of her  --  of her devotion , her physical force , her integrity . But Mother , it seems , pays no heed to my thoughts and heads west from there down a gentle slope to the valley and the monastery that dwells in it . All around grew old olive trees with twisted trunks , pocked and pitted like corpses eroded by the soil of their graves . She was always amazed at these dead-looking trunks with such fresh silvery-green treetops rejoicing on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a shiny little military locomotive would sometimes appear and rumble boldly to the north . From here the riverbed descended to the south and vanished among bare rounded mountains . In the afternoon a pleasant wind blew in the ravine , rustled in the olive trees , scattered dry yellow seeds , and rippled the garments of haze that turned pink in the light of the setting sun . In the distance two mighty oaks were seen , and once , when she walked to them , she saw the Arab peasant women of Malha dancing between them , lifting big dolls of cloth and straw and praying for rain ; and though they called to her , she did n't dare come close and dance with them but only smiled at them from a distance . In the center of the valley stood a huge building  --  the Monastery of the Cross , which the Arabs call Mutslabi , the biggest and most ancient monastery in the whole country . Enormous buttresses had been built against the walls ; covered with lichen and mold , they looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone in its flight . There was one tiny door in the wall , shut like an eye under brows of climbing plants . Beyond the wall appeared the sharp black crest of a cypress that looked to Mother like a prisoner stretching in his cell . There were also a few peepholes in the wall , and sometimes the monastery blinked : a tiny window would open and close again at once . Sometimes the place filled with students and priests from Greece , but most days of the year only one monk lived there , a man from Kandia in Crete , along with his sister and mother , a spinster and a widow . The two women cooked his meals , mended and ironed his clothes , warmed and perfumed his bath water , scrubbed and toweled his flesh . A few times Sarah saw the pair of short women , dressed in black , creeping along the path like a pair of drone beetles , carrying baskets to the monastery . Once she also saw the monk himself , a tiny energetic man , emerge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , and burst into a trot . Like a rubber  | ball , he bounced around the walls of his prison , shedding robes and cries as he ran until he was clown to a short white skirt and sandals with red thongs , leaping and shouting incomprehensible verses whose special rhythm made clear that they were ancient poems . In springtime the soil of the little valley put forth a profusion of lush grass , and the Arabs of Malha and Sheikh Bader grazed their lambs there . The burnet turned red in myriads of tiny flowers that looked like the clay pots that earned it its name . Crab-apple trees blossomed in a white raiment , a pleasant smell of soap wafted from them , and wasps circled them . The wasps too had by now adopted the angry Jerusalem buzz , a buzz of envy , threat , and possession . Jews gave the valley a wide berth , but no one did her any harm there . The inhabitants of the monastery thought her an eccentric pilgrim , the shepherds feared her height , the knob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She loved to feel the sap of trodden stalks of asphodel on her toes , to spray the purple heads of briars with childish kicks , to catch and release lizards and locusts . Here she gathered the dried fruit of the storksbills and sat for hours watching them curl slowly and drill into the earth or the cloth of her dress . On her return , everyone greeted her with dark looks . They did n't approve of a woman walking around alone and daring to go outside the city walls . Only Duduch welcomed her warmly . The two women were good friends and found consolation in each other 's company . Duduch told Sarah what they said about her in the courtyard , and Sarah gave Duduch the gift her parents had sent her : a colored wooden doll containing another doll that also had a doll inside  --  four wooden dolls with the same smile and the same eyes and the same red cheeks and the same strange sweet name : Matryoshka . Duduch was already known as a nikogira  --  a good and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell of its blue sheen without recalling Laura , Laura Luthy , Thomas Tracy 's and William Saroyan 's girl . At that time , Duduch married Elijah Nathan , the love of her life , and discovered that marriage turned her beloved into a different man , a man of sick jealousy who forsook his calculations and his stars and did n't even allow her to stand at the window or go alone to the outhouse in the courtyard . She and Sarah played together a lot , like two little girls , and complained to one another about the death of their husbands ' love , one under the silken sandal of the fitting and proper , the other under the tramping boot of jealousy and madness .  | On Dr. Korkidi 's advice Sarah got pregnant again , and this time twins ran about in her womb . After she gave birth to me and Jacob , she purchased some goatskin bags and some bowls and opened a little dairy . She bought milk from the shepherds of Lifta and Abu Ghosh and specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of milk boiling in its kettle drew customers , cats , and furious cornpetitors , and deposited a sourish ancient stratum of sediment in my memory . I am not drawn to smells , but I am gifted with the ability to reconstruct them . " The pleasures of sound are more magical to me than the pleasures of smell , " said Saint Augustine , and added , " With the attractions of odors I am not much troubled . When absent I do not seek them ; when present I do not refuse them ; and am prepared ever to be without them . " I swore to myself that I would n't put in a lot of quotations here , but sometimes I ca n't curb my desire . At any rate , because of my sharp nose , my soft brain , and my weak eyes , most of my memories of Jerusalem are smells and sounds , and only a few of them are pictures . Even when we were infants , Mother noticed that Jacob and I could n't recognize her from more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see very well , he responded with his favorite word of dismissal : " Pun-tikos . " He declared that most of the inhabitants of the city had sick eyes of one kind or another , and concluded with one of his impenetrable sayings about sharp sight , which in Jerusalem had been nothing but a handicap from time immemorial . Mother was n't assuaged . Her long arms , her anxious shouts , and the stone walls of the courtyards and alleys kept us from going far from her . She also put her white goose in charge of us and , following the local custom , pinned notes to our shirts with our names and the name of our father writ-  | tell on them . A lot of children walked around Jerusalem like that iii those clays , and when I recall it now , I chuckle to myself , because we all looked like delegates to the biggest Jewish congress of them all : the congress of fearful mothers and their children who threaten to go astray . Like many natives of the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with the sense of sight . The eye furnished us only a general and foggy view , while the nose and the ear , divination and memory , gave it an anchoring and a means of identification . Jerusalem presented her opaque curtains of stone to our weak pupils , beguiled our ears with bells and wails , laid us down on ponds of her smell . Despite that ability I mentioned , few are the smells I miss , and above all I have no wish to recapture the repulsive smells of my hometown . But in America ? " the lovely trustful , dreamy enormous country , " remember ? ? where I live and where many of the women have only one smell , the lack of stimuli sometimes leads me to recall that desperate , violent , and hopeless blend of kitchens , latrines , and the sweat of worshipers ' toes . One by one , they rise up before me . From the stench of rot and blood in the butcher shops to the sweet aroma wafting from the tiny alcove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter some air-conditioned American store , a memory of the good warm smell of the miserable donkeys of Jerusalem will suddenly rise to my nose , those heavily laden donkeys with sores on their rumps and ankles , the skin on their necks and backs scraped to bleeding baldness by whips and bridles , and with it the smell of the dust that collects in the prints of their little jet-black hooves . A bitter green smell rose from the wall where the cattle drovers urinated . They led the herds of the Steel brothers from the highlands of the Sudan , and the tremendous thundering of countless hooves raised clouds of haze that could be seen a week before they arrived , tinting the eastern horizon with red dust . The black drovers rounded them up with shouts , drumming , and goads of palm thorns , and they burst into the city with their mighty humps , roaring and nicking the walls of the alley with their horns . Like all who come to the gates of Jerusalem , these enormous cattle did n't know they were being driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose high , closed on them , and led them to the slaughterhouse . Right after they coralled the herd in pens , the drovers were free for their ceremonial urinating on the wall of the Tower of Storks . They had so much urine , and it was so strong and pungent , that it melted karstic cavities in the chalky stone ; and the Christians made fun of them , saying they had restrained themselves all the way , a journey of several months , so they  | could scrupulously observe the commandment of their Mahdi to make water on the holy stones of Jerusalem . Warm and vibrant , the smells swept us off to the H-Atarin souk , a dim ' livered t rap where no one saw well except those who blend mixtures of cloves , nutmeg , and coffee , and those who deal in drugs and perfumes . They had sat there for so many years that some of them had already gone blind , and the rest had pupils as wide as coins and the eyesight of an owl . In one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , stolid English soldier entering the souk with a confident step and tottering out the other end to fall on his face in the open sewer , where his beret sailed off like it small boat . Even after the tiny poniard was discovered stuck between his ribs , people continued to argue that he had n't been murdered , since they were used to seeing foreigners emerge from the perfume souk with shaky knees , a dopey smile , and eyes rolling from the rich conjunction of smells and darkness . There were other smells , because water was doled out in small quantities and the daily washing of the whole body was a luxury of the rich . In a blend of nausea , rage , and nostalgia  --  which , by the way , is the correct filter for photographing Jerusalem  --  I restore them today . The smoke of dung bonfires rose from the cloaks of the shepherds , sweat from the cracked necks of the stonecutters , a maternal smell of kishek cheese , lemon buds , and lamb fat from the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests and clinging to our bodies like a dark , hidden threat , the smell of bread trailing from the old Armenians , and the sour vapor rising from the fur hats of the Hasids , who wore them even in summer , and our father called them " gatos muertos , " dead cats , because of the way they looked and smelled . A nice smell came from our neighbor 's young bride when we all went out to see her coming back from the " banyo de b'tulim , " the virgin 's bath , and labdanum of the wounds of her body rose up , mixing with the rainwater smell of the women 's mikve . The Maman and Teitelbaum families , who were also in the dairy business , took up arms against Mother , and she did n't flinch . There were fights that ended in broken vessels and teeth , spilled milk and blood , and split goatskin bags and sacks of cheese . But when they falsely accused her of touching the milk during her period , mixing camel 's milk with yogurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach to make cheese , the rabbis banned her products and she was forced to sell them to the hostels for tourists and pilgrims . When Jacob and I were two years old , she started climbing the Mount of Olives every morning and selling to the nuns of Mary Magdalene .  | From there she went north on the ridge and sold kefir to the workers who were laying the foundations of the ? university on Mount Scopus . Sometimes she took us with her , and when we returned , riding together on the donkey halter she hoisted onto her broad back , she brought us to Reina de ( ; crop and the refreshing perfume of her flowers . On her sun-drenched balcony above the street of the Karaites , Reina de Geron placed pots of wood , earthenware , and tin , and grew flowers that overflowed the balcony ledge like cascades , flooding the alley with cool flames of smell and color . Aromas wafted from her courtyard night and clay , from the reina de la noche , the fragrant white night-blooming flower ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter ; from the profuse white butterflies of the jasmine , the purple sweet basil , and the chalices of the white lily brought here by the wives of the Crusaders who left them so their sons could find their way back to the Holy City . People were always clustered at the wall of Reina 's courtyard , seeking in her flowers a balm for their anguish , consolation and hope for the bitterness of their soul . By now they had despaired of the promises of the city , of her whiny prophets , her tarrying messiahs , her leaders puffed up with wealth and pride . Some of them lost control , took ladders , and climbed up to stick their heads in the petals and pick bouquets ; and Reina de Geron , like generations of besieged Jerusalemites before her , prayed and cursed , pushed their ladders off the wall , and poured slops on them from her dishpans and the basiniho under her bed . Mother , Jacob , and I stood in the alley and raised our heads . In our weak eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful foggy lamb 's fleece , but the smells of the lily and narcissus , the rose and dianthus , were sharp and clear , and every movement of the head changed their nuances and enhanced their richness . Many years later , when I was living in the United States , I once swam in a warm lake where cold currents moved like snakes ' tongues . I recalled the smells of those flowers , which also moved side by side but did n't merge with one another . A memory of a smile rose in my heart and spread from there to my face . My hands grasped the waist of the woman swimming at my side . A young woman , she was , a redhead , handsome and tall , who constantly bemoaned the fact that she was n't a boy . I hugged her , I laughed with a mouthful of bubbles , and plunged the two of us into the water so my beloved would n't see my tears .  | Another summer came to an end . In the evening a wonderful breeze blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp necks , penetrating the stink of abbayahs , capotas , saddles , and cloaks , and calming man and beast . The Days of Awe stood at the gate , and with the approach of Yom Kippur everyone took care to improve his relations with his fellow man . " The Creator-Blessed-Be-He says to man , Why do you come to me ? First go to your fellow man , " the neighbor women explained to Sarah when they came to apologize for offending and insulting her . But the impending holidays filled her with tension , and going to the synagogue was her Via Dolorosa . In the women 's section , she knew , everyone would still look at her as if she were a man who had snuck in , and the sight of Abraham 's back through the wooden partition would n't comfort her either . She did n't know the melodies of the prayers , nor did she understand their strange words . " May we enjoy a good and sweet year . " Abraham smiled at her when she brought to the table the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples in honey , prasa , pumpkin , leeks , pears , and beets . He explained to her that beets symbolized the beating of the foes , leeks stood for the blood that would leak from our enemies ' veins , and pears for the repair of the evil decree against us . When my brother 's daughter Romi was bat-mitzvah , Father told her the same stories , and Romi , who looks a lot like her grandmother but is wiser and more wicked , suggested he serve poppy seeds at Purim in memory of Mordechai " speaking peace to all his seed . " " Satanika ! " Father raged at her . " And dates at Passover , Grandfather . " She did n't let up . " For the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched palm . "  | But Sarah loved those simple legends and the flavor of the holiday dishes . That year , after they had lasted and blessed the fruits , Bulisa Levy got up and , grinning broadly , went to the kitchen corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head and not the tail " and " In memory of the sacrifice of Isaac , " she returned and placed a lamb 's head on the table . Everybody gasped in admiration . As for the head , it gazed drowsily at Sarah with eyes sleepy from baking so long and a smile of horror spread on its roasted lips . A lump of nausea gored her throat , her eyes rolled . She landed amid slivers of crushed fruit and broken glass , sticky webs of honey and vomit . A horrible commotion arose . Bulisa Levy shouted , " Shame , shame ! " Abraham 's whole body shook , and Sarah ran out of the courtyard . That night , for the first time , she told Abraham she wanted to move somewhere else and open their own bakery . But Abraham , whose fear of new places and willful women silenced him , and whose main asset was his seat on the back of fifteen generations in Jerusalem , told her there was an economic depression in the land and this was n't the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people will always eat the bread , " she pleaded , but to no avail . In spring , when everyone was busy cleaning and whitewashing their houses and doing laundry , and doors and windows stood wide open , the Nawarites , roving fortune tellers from India , began appearing in the courtyards , sowing anxiety among all the mothers of the city . They were known as thieves , carriers of disease , and kidnappers , and mother was no longer satisfied to pin notes to our shirts . When we went to play in the courtyard , she tied long strings of red wool to our wrists , and these twisted up to her wrist , got tangled , and made all three of us stumble . But it was because of those wool strings that we finally left the city . The Nawarites , black and grimy as the sides of a kettle , with forked tongues , clad in rags , lived in the ancient cells of the jail of I-labs el-Abid and among the tombstones at the Gate of Mercy . They knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavated and discovered the Jebusite sewer , to their surprise they found two old Nawarites sitting there playing cards . Equipped with empty sacks , nimble fingers , and dancing bears , they appeared in the courtyards . They pulled wheezing doves out of the lapa turbans wound around their heads , perfumed silk handkerchiefs from the buttocks of surprised donkeys , and hen 's eggs , still warm and damp , from under the cloaks of blushing priests .  | They tarried hear cubs in a very cruel way . The animal was made to stand on a hot tin , and then they played tunes on a violin and a noisy little bagpipe while four female ( lancers circled him in a ring of clasped hands . The miserable cub hopped and danced on the blazing tin , shrieking in indescribable torment and amazement . Everybody thought he was trying to imitate the dancers ' movements , but the truth was that the ring of girls kept him from fleeing . Finally , one of the dancers would bend down and take him up in her arms , caress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pan of cold water . Thus the bears learned their lesson , and like people smitten by love , all it took was the sight of a violin or the scent of a dancer to revive the memory of the tune of pain and make them dance . As soon as the tinkle of their earrings and the groans of their bears were heard in the alleys , Mother 's white skin would turn red , then dark brown with anger . " Dance , dance , ya-ta'ban , " sang the bear tamer , and the bear would grimace and launch into a clumsy step that looked so much like the wedding dance of the Ashkenazi Ilasids that the whole crowd burst into laughter and applause . When the bear tamer saw that attention was focused on his performing animal , he sent his wives , brothers , cousins , and children to steal food and pots from kitchens , babies from empty houses , and garments from clotheslines . " Back in the Astrakhan , " said Mother , " they teach children to walk on high wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And indeed , a child who fell into the snares of the Nawarites did not return to the land of the living or the home of his father and mother , and even the English police detectives and their dogs could n't find him . The kidnappers would abscond with their victim to one of their hidden burrows and smother him with a soft pillow of silk and down , so nice to the touch that it left an expression of bliss on the face of the murdered baby . Then they would slit the belly of the little corpse with a knife , fill it with potent drugs , and baste it with embroidery thread spun , said the Jerusalemites , from the webs of glowworms . One of their women would carry the dead child in her arms , deep in sweet dreams to all appearances , and thus they smuggled drugs from one country to another . The city weighed ever more heavily on Mother 's shoulders . Hatred swelled inside her , and when we were four years old , there was that incident with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , kidnap her family , and flee Jerusalem .  | It happened on our first day of school , when we were brought to the Talmaud Torah of a little rubbi , cruel and loathsome , whose name I have n't managed to forget , but I do n't want to mention it . Mother was very excited . True , she was illiterate , but unlike the other illiterate women of the courtyard , she did n't accept the rule that ignorance is destiny . " Need to learn , " she kept telling us , " need alef-beit . " The classroom was half cellar , half pit , and its crumbling cement floor was covered with torn reed mats . All day long the boys knelt on the mats on numb legs , reciting their lessons . At that time Jacob and I were still tied together with that red wool string , and when we came to heder , we refused to untie the string and part from one another . When the rubbi pulled out a pair of scissors and was about to cut us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string , and fell to the floor together . A commotion started . The rubbi took his cow 's tail lash down from the wall . " This is the razon , justice ! " he said , hitting Jacob on his back and head and pinching my ears something awful . In the afternoon Mother returned from Mount Scopus and hurried to heder to pamper us with kantoniko , a heel of bread dipped in salt and olive oil . When Jacob refused to eat and burst into tears , Mother 's suspicions were aroused . She interrogated him until he went to the wall and showed her the whip . Mother took off his shirt and saw the red lash marks . I remember the slow turning of the broad shoulders , the hands stretched out in the air , the deep flush that rose from her chest to her throat and face . A loud hiss was heard , and the white goose suddenly appeared flying heavily over the wall of the courtyard and landing in its center . A strange and bitter frost rose in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trouble had overtaken him , and was already preparing to dart from his bankita and flee for his life . But the goose planted himself at the rubbi 's legs , and with two long lioness strides Mother caught the man and pushed him down on his knees . She grabbed him by the nape of his neck and lashed him with the " razon " so hard even she could n't stop herself . The rubbi 's shouts of fear and pain drew the denizens of the whole alley . The people were afraid to stop Mother , for dreadful was she in her rage , and the goose did n't let anyone get near . Here he is : his neck is twisted between his shoulders , his big wings are spread to half their span , curved like scimitars . Can you see him , my dear ? He walks around Mother , his beak is orange and wide open . His voice rises in my ears . Seeking a quarrel . Whispering and hissing , keeping watch over his mistress .  | Motherwas like a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . She jumped on the swooning rubbi with her wooden clogs , screaming " I 'm the Tartar ! I 'm the Tartar ! " and other words nobody understood . She vomited up all the rage massed inside her . She picked the rubbi up , propped him on his waxen knees , and pounded his head against the wall . The thud was dull and pleasant . Crumbled plaster stained with blood dropped to the floor . If Father had n't been summoned , the rubbi would have been a dead man . He approached Mother , and everyone could tell that he too was in awe of her . But the moment she saw him she grew calm , sat down on the floor like a baby , with her legs spread out in front of her , rolled her yellow head , and began crying and striking her breast with her fist like an Arab mourner , both from shame and from the anger that was n't completely slaked . Meanwhile , Dr. Korkidi also came and started tending to the rubbi . At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father managed to persuade Mother to stand up . She hoisted Jacob onto her shoulders , picked me up in one arm , laid the other on Father 's narrow shoulder , and thus we returned home . In'the evening Dr. Korkidi came to us , scolded her for her violence , treated Jacob 's wounds , and said things to Father that we could n't hear . As she told us later , when we were young men , it was then that she decided to flee Jerusalem . " The camel is already broken straw in back of all of ' em , " said Romi , and burst out laughing . She loves to mimic her grand-mother 's broken Hebrew and to repeat some of her sentences . Just yesterday she asked me , " Make up your couch ? " Sometimes it scares me that they look so much alike , and then I remind myself of what Henry Fielding said to the literary critic : " Another caution we would give thee , my good reptile , is , that thou dost not find out too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I tell myself , and I smile , calm down , and am consoled .  | On the night of the big quake , July 12 , 1927 , we ran away from the city . Everybody was sure that Father , Mother , Jacob , and I were buried under the rubble . Only two weeks later , when they cleared the heaps of stones and linked one fact with another , memory with gossip , and crumb with crumb , did they understand what had happened . But by then we were already far from Jerusalem , from the dairy , from Tia Duduch , and from Bulisa Levy , whom you are indeed correct , my dear , I should call Grandmother , but I have no desire to do so . In the bowels of the carriage Mother hid the foundations of our future . A red-gray heating brick she had secretly removed from the depths of the baker Ergas 's oven , to place as an amulet on the floor of the new oven she would build . A tiny leather bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quenching revenge  --  by a nonkosher piece of calf stomach . A piece of levadura , an aromatic sourdough starter , swaddled in cloth and breathing like a baby . Many years later , Jacob told me that the progeny of that starter dough Mother brought from Jerusalem still continued its leavening in his bakery , like those immortal molecules of albuminous sperm sprayed from generation to generation . But by then I knew my uncle Elijah was right . Human characteristics are n't content with the routine paths paved for them by heredity . They also pass in milk , in stories , in the touch of fingertips and the saliva of a kiss . It was a hot night , but Mother did n't let us take the cover off the carriage . Right after we got out of the city she abandoned the highway and turned left onto the mule path leading to Dir Yassin ; about a kilometer from the village she turned right and landed in a narrow , steep ravine with a winding road paved with stones . As we passed the smooth rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfamiliar smell filled my nostrils . A few weeks  | ago I went back there with Romi and peeled away all the new houses , streets , tombstones , and highways off the ground , and I found that road again and went down its slope . An old man picking Blood-of-the-Maccabees  --  what you call cornflowers  --  told me it had been paved by Titus when he went up to destroy the city and that no one could build roads like the Romans . There 's an abandoned quarry there , and the sound of shooting rises from it , and that same smell came back and called to me from grape skins fermenting in the nearby winery , intoxicating proof of the quality of my memory . Jacob and I glued our eyes to the pinprick holes in the carriage cover , flared our nostrils to smell the wet wildflowers , bent our ears to the noise of the wheels , to the heavy breathing and the tread of the winged sandals of our mother Sarah . Accompanied by the barking dogs of Kolonia , she crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp twists of the mound of the Castel . We did n't marvel at her speed or her strength . Everybody knew that the mysteries and forces of another land and another people were forged in Mother 's body . A small village sat atop the mountain then , and beyond it Mother started groaning and stumbling with the effort to brake on the downgrade . From the foothills , not far from a grove of gigantic plane trees and the pallid ruins of a monastery , we heard the braying of scared mules , the grunting of camels , and the shouting of merchants . A pungent , startling smell of fish came from the mountains , where those who brought watermelons and fish from Gaza would park before ascending to Jerusalem ; everything had been scattered by the quake that struck their camp . Amid chunks of broken watermelon and ice and wide-mouthed fish carcasses , nobody paid any attention to a carriage harnessed to a woman . From here on out , opinions are divided . Jacob claims we hid among the vineyards of Abu Ghosh with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain that Mother continued her assault on her road that same night , passed the village of Saris like the wind , and galloped along the bank of a deep riverbed with dark gloomy mountains on either side and a khan at the end . " I remember clearly that we came to a big vineyard , " Jacob tells me . I also remember the vines , pruned and laden with fruit , but in my opinion those were the vineyards of the monastery of Latrun and the fields of Dir Ayub . The sun was about to rise , Mother collapsed between the shafts as if an invisible scythe had lopped her off at the ankles . A thick smell of dust and burdock rose from her torn clothes and her wounded feet .  | " Now shout , " she whispered , her mouth full of dirt , " now shout , hit . ' lb the Rusalem I do n't go back . " And Father , scared by the darkness and the goose , with a cloth gag in his mouth , did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night we traveled and by day we hid . The tones of the earth changed , its smell grew richer , and the tramp of the foot was answered by a soft rustle of flesh , and not the beating of boulders . Stars changed their places . Ruined wayside shelters and cactus hedges sprang up along our route . Mother 's flying thighs never flagged . Mountain and valley , field and wasteland , brook and swamp , oleander and sycamore . The plain welcomed us with the open , shorn fields of August , warm , soft smells , and crushed plowed earth that held no stones or promises , and no memories or graves were rotting in it . I remember the scratching of coarse leaves against the side of the carriage , the bright silhouette of a distant Arab town with ancient olive trees turning silver all around , a muezzin singing , turrets and palm trees rising . I remember our arrival in the village , Mother arguing there with amazed people who did n't wear hats or sport beards . She was very agitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side like a bundle of rags and did n't say a thing . By now Mother had removed his fetters because she knew he would n't run away . Shame and honor were the strongest chains his world knew , and they would n't let him return to Jerusalem to be an object of derision . Slowly the argument and the shouting died out , and a woman invited us to eat and spend the night in one of the huts . The next evening a loaded wooden wagon appeared in the village , harnessed to a big ox , and with it came Mother 's father and brothers and a mule with a terrified , bleating heifer tied to its back . Mother fell on their shoulders , wept with joy , hugged the ox 's neck . " He was little , he was little , " she repeated , and beat the ani-mal 's forehead fondly . I was surprised to discover that Mother was n't the only one of her species in the world . Her brothers were big like she was , with wrists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveted on my grandfather , the convert Mikhail Nazaroff , whom I saw then for the first and only time . He was even taller than Mother and her brothers , and his countenance ? " that masterpiece of force and melancholy " ? immediately touched my childish heart and was seared there like a brand . His face pink , like a youth filled with the sap of life , His beard long and gray , each hair steeped in silver ,  | Milling in curls on his torso and vaulted chest ; Eyebrows too are silvery , hairy , and thick , Taut like arches , joining each other , a boundary to his delicate forehead . When I was twenty-one and Jacob took Leah away from me and I ran off to the United States , I made a few literary pilgrimages . I did n't get to the Crimean Peninsula , but I did visit Hannibal , Fresno , Walden , and Nantucket . In the library in Camden , as I was looking at a picture of Walt Whitman , two things occurred to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandfather 's , even though Whitman , being a poet , had to look more sensitive . And right after that , as if taking hold of the heel of the first memory , was born the knowledge that I had seen the picture of Whitman back in my childhood , on the wall of the village library , and the line Yehiel Abramson , the librarian , selected to put under the picture floated up in my mind : " Behold ! I do not give lectures or a little charity , / When I give I give myself . " But back then , in the presence of Walt Whit-man 's picture in that library , I was n't reminded of Dyedushka Mikhail . Grandfather wore a gray cap and a shirt belted with a rope ; big blue patches adorned his trousers , and his hands were as enormous as baker 's shovels . I was about five years old then , could n't fathom his expression , and did n't understand what I do today  --  that Dyedushka Mikhail wanted to experience again the pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful catastrophe . Walking barefoot in a field , he cut his toe on a sharp , flinty rock , and the infection poisoned his blood and killed him in horrible torment . " He 's not live , " Mother lamented her father , and then she whispered to us , " He had the dreadful death . " Grandfather drank three glasses of boiling tea one after another , his eyes shut , his lips taut , and with every mouthful he sighed and said , " Ah ... that 's good . . . . Ah . . . that 's good .... " When he saw Jacob and me watching him , he smiled and picked us up in his arms , and even then I could feel that like Mother , he too was drawn more to my brother , for Jacob is built like Father and has his coloring . " Little Jew , " he called him proudly , and laughed , tears of joy glimmering in his eyes . He caressed and hugged me too , but out of simple affection ; jumbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finished his tea he went to Father and said , " It will be good , Abraham , it will be good . " But Father , sitting off to the side with his head bowed , did n't extend his hand to him , and the old convert said no more but turned and began telling his sons what they were to do that day .  | Summer reigned , and Mother 's brothers quickly erected a big hut of cloth , branches , and posts for us . From the wagon they unloaded sacks of cement and gravel , tools , wooden beams , and molds for making bricks . They had the wisdom of peasants . First they built the oven , because the oven for a family , they said , is like the anchor for a ship and the roots for a tree . " Once upon a time , " Grandfather told us , " trees did n't have any roots and they could walk . " But then they did n't give fruit because they were too busy with wars , expeditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have themselves planted in the ground . Every morning , the men in Mother 's family proudly wrapped themselves in tallises too narrow to cover their broad shoulders and fastened the straps of the tefillin with a force known only to ascetics , ox drivers , and barge haulers . Veins thick as ropes stood out in their flesh . They prayed hesitantly , with slow , heavy words that got tangled in their beards and brought an expression of contempt to Father 's face . Afterward they spat noisily on the palms of their hands and got down to work . The oven they built looked like a giant belly with a chimney sprouting from it . The uncles rigged up a heavy black iron door that could be raised and lowered with a mechanism of cogs and sprocket wheels . Beside it they introduced an innovation : a peephole with a thick glass pane so you could shine a light through and watch the loaves as they baked . They attached an oil burner to the door , the acme of progress and perfection in those days , seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a long arm that turned on an axle so you could direct the spout to every corner of the oven 's belly . A steam bellows fanned the fire inside , and there was a black cast-iron boiler and a three-headed Swedish Primus stove . At the bottom of the door , they dug the baker 's pit , where the oven man plies his trade , and floored it with stone tiles . After the oven was completed they built the bakery itself around it , with a workroom and a storeroom with thick masonry walls , and only then did they build us a small house with two rooms and a kitchen . " What a good hands my brothers have , " said Mother proudly . She worked alongside them , she hauled , dug , erected , and cast , and also made us meals in a pot that hung over a fire in the yard , planted trees , and put up a fence . She loved borders , and she loved even more the area they circumscribed . Our new neighbor brought us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frau Levy , " he laughed , in an accent brand-new to us . His name was Isaac Brinker , and I 'll tell you about him later . Mother made sour kefir for us all and invited Brinker to have some too , and all the while Father sat with a melancholy expression , like a prisoner among his wardens , the white  | kerchief of torment bound around Isis forehead , but here in the new place no one understood what it meant . When the work was done , we all gathered at the oven , and even Father stirred from his place to come to the first lighting . Dyedushka Mikhail grabbed his shoulders and said , " Please , Abraham . " Father puffed out his lips in perfect imitation of a child trying to blow out the candles on his birthday cake . He lit the big Primus stove , and when the steam was compressed in the tank , he opened the cock of the oil spigot and put a burning rag to the spout of the burner . How well I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shot the flame inside . For a long time Father listened to the roar of the burner , turned the spout first to the right and then to the left , then fired the center of the oven , and went on like that until it grew dark outside and the bricks glowed with a dark and pleasant redness reflected in all our faces . Father turned off the burner and an awful silence prevailed . He put a finger to his lips so no one would utter a word , went down to the pit , and listened for the rustle of the bricks cooling . A few cracks were heard , but not a single brick slipped out of place . Everyone stepped back , and Father put his hand inside and turned his palm here and there to test the quality of the heat and its feel , and studied the nature of the new oven . Then he gathered saliva in his mouth and spat inside as Isaac Ergas had taught him in Jerusalem , bending his ear to decipher the vaporizing whisper with incomparable expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my readers the fact that every brick oven has its own personality ; I described the construction of that oven , but there I chose to write that it was built in Jerusalem , not by Mother 's brothers but by the famous oven builder Gel -- shorn Zilberberg , a Polish Hasid who never really existed . When everybody went to sleep , Father remained at his new oven . All night he lay near the door and stuck his hand inside from time to time , stroked the blazing bricks , and closed his eyes . In the morning the brothers took simple carpentry tools out of their wagon , and following his instructions , they planed and smoothed boards for the work table , built the gareh , as they called the rising chamber , and made sieves , kneading troughs , and long and short baker 's shovels . Then the youngest of them harnessed the ox , and in the evening he returned with sacks of flour , yeast , sugar , salt , and cans of oil . After the brothers unloaded the flour and sifted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does n't remember anything from that night , and I , who remember more than what happened on it , huddled together on the side , and those moments when the Prisms stove and the burner roared and the sourish , living smell of the coast spread in the . air I remember them well , even though Jacob claims I 'm taking Mother 's stories apart and reconstructing them . " What else have you got to do there in America but sit and waste time and make up memories ? " he grumbles . I admit he 's right . I 'll tell the truth : sometimes I lie . Father emptied the sacks of flour into the kneading troughs , added water and sugar and salt , and poured in the yeast mixture . The dough began to rise and give off its sour smell , and Mother rolled up her sleeves and started kneading  --  folding , heating , pulling , pounding . Tears spilled from her eyes onto the dough , and sweat and snot joined them . Her face blazed from the effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barefoot she was , and whenever her hands raked the dough , the big muscles in her legs bulged , the Achilles tendons in her heels stretched taut , and her toes clenched hard , gripping the ground . When the dough rose , Father cut it into pieces , shaped them into round loaves , and put them in the new gareh to rise some more . Half an hour later he turned off the burner , closed the chimney , sprayed a quarter of a bucket of water on the white-hot bricks , went down into the pit , grabbed the shovel , and started shooting the loaves into the oven with fine , precise hands . When the smell of baked bread filled the air , everybody got excited and smiled at one another . Father took his bread out of the oven and immediately sprinkled glaze on the hot crust . Mother took the first loaf , broke it , and gave everyone a piece . " For he who made us live and exist and brought us to this time , " said Dyedushka Mikhail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salt , and we all ate . Less than two minutes later a tumult arose outside . The village people came running , their heavy shoes clumping . The smell emanating from the new bakery hovered like a cloud of sweetness over their poor huts , flooded their dusty street , burst through walls of wood and tattered blankets , and struck their nostrils . They brought cheese , tomatoes , and olives , they even found liquor and herring somewhere . Isaac Brinker , the friendly neighbor , spread a tablecloth on the cutting boards , and everybody smiled and laughed and sang , patted Father on the shoulder , hugged us and each other . It had been only a year since they settled on the land , and their happiness filled the space . " Now we 've got a bakery , " they said . " May it bring good luck for all of us. " 74  | Mother sliced bread for everybody , lather smiled , and for a moment he even looked content . We did n't know back then that he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding , the building of the bakery by the " Russkies . " Even though he knew that if not for " her , " her strength and energy , he would have remained a baker 's apprentice to the end of his clays , a miserable and wretched Jerusalem orniro , he nursed a hostility for her that rose and flourished until it took on a life of its own and no longer needed tending since , like all hatred , it was sustained by its own leaven . And Mother , whose big body hid a grateful twelve-year-old gooseherd , wet with rain , throbbing and smitten with love , never stopped loving him for a single day . And here , here 's a picture of Jamila I see in my mind 's eye , blurry and tremulous as if emerging in a pan of developing fluid . Here she comes  --  coins tinkling on the embroidery of her bodice , the ring green in her nose  --  bringing us a wicker basket of homegrown Baladi apricots , the most wonderful fruit in the world if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving her stale bread to feed her chickens . Father would fume and say we had to feed our own chickens first , and Mother would answer : " There 's enough for everybody , Abraham . For us and for thems too . " Jamila had a big Cypriot she-ass , white and light-footed , and when she got pregnant by our donkey , Father declared , " Congratulations , now the Arab woman and the Russkie woman are in-laws . " Apparently Mother poured her heart out to her in-law , for the Arab woman came to her aid . It was springtime , rain was still falling now and then , and Jamila told Mother to take vats into the yard and collect the spring rainwater in them . The next day she gathered an enormous bundle of camomile in the hills and told Mother to soak it in the water she had collected and shampoo her hair with it . That 's what Arab peasant women do , she said , to revive love .  | Mother followed her instructions , and I still remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungent smell , full , and seductive , rose from her head , and her fair braids shone with a new intensity . That day she walked around as if a crown had been put on her head , naively believing the fragrance of rain and field would lead Father to love her again . Jacob and I peeped out the bakery window as she heated the rainwater on the Primus stove , took off her blouse , and , weeping mutely , bent over the big basin . It was the same basin she used to wash Jacob and me , and say , " Shut your eyes , " when she lathered our heads with the stinging Nablus soap . She had a fair neck , the arms of a wrestler , broad white shoulders , and the pale , delicate nipples of a little girl . Her fair skin gleamed in the permanent gloom of the bakery , muscles rippled in her back and her long , prominent shoulder blades . Her hair , in choked serpents of red and gold , floated in the perfumed water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkroom of my memory , do I begin to understand them  --  the tremor of her fingers when she brought food to the table , her extinguished looks while kneading the dough , her frightened smile when she looked in a mirror , her childish , coarse , repentant voice : " Abraham , Abraham , Abraham ... " I spent my whole childhood and youth in the shadow of my brother 's love for Leah and in the shadow of my father 's hatred for my mother . At first I did n't understand , then I refused to understand , and finally the knowledge swooped down on me , grabbed me by the scruff of the neck , and hurled me from this house to the ends of the earth . Eearly in the morning , compunctions rise from my father 's room . Should he have slept all night with the window open ? Should he put l on his shirt before his pants ? And what is " the good way " to button it ? From the bottom button up or vice-versa ?  | From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already putting on the pots . From the bakery conics the noise of my brother Jacob and our cousin Simon working , dragging crates of bread and preparing deliveries . Leah , my brother 's wife , is sleeping in her room . All of their three children are where they belong . Michael , their little son , is in the nursery . Benjamin , their firstborn , is in his grave . Romi has already slipped off to the city . flow loud and orderly is the singing of the awakening birds . First  --  as in my childhood  --  come the bulbuls , clustered like dark balls on the branches of the lemon tree and the electrical wires , their feathers puffed out and bristling with the chill of dawn , the yellow trim under their tails mocking the gravity of their black skullcaps . The crowing of the roosters and the lowing of the hungry calves are no longer heard in the village , but the bulbuls , as in the days when we first came here , still chatter every morning and tell their unchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start singing , and their voices roll up their throats like transparent marbles . Then the male blackbirds stir , opening their orange beaks wide in song , or whistles , or imitation prayers , until the sun rises to the shrill screams of the jays , the graceful and violent hoodlums of the gardens . Father , from his room on the other side of the house , is still debating aloud with himself : " Now I 'll put my feet out of the bed and put on my house slippers . Then I 'll go to the toilet , and then I 'll drink coffee , and then I 'll shave . " And after a brief silence : " No ! First I 'll shave , and then I 'll drink coffee , and I 'll walk around a little , and then I 'll have a good bowel movement . " " Either you come take care of him or I 'll throw him out of the house , " Jacob wrote me . " You know I never got along with him , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time that he has pains . No doctor finds anything wrong with him . I ca n't stand him anymore , I never could stand him , and I 've got enough troubles without him . He 's your father too , so please ! " And I , who did n't go to my mother 's funeral or my nephews ' circumcisions , packed three suitcases that very day , left a note on the door , a stupid joke addressed to no one in particular ? " The baker will be away for a month . If knead be , please apply to Dr. Norstrom , Boulevard Haussman 66 " ? took the train to New York , and flew home . On entering the village , I told the cab driver to go on and unload the suitcases at the gate of our yard , and I got out and walked down the street . Groping , recognizing , my memories strode ahead of me , barking with excitement . It was very early in the morning , and the old rumbling of the  | palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it had been there for years and had oniv now managed to burst from the foliage . The little houses of the peasants had changed owners , added Tears and floors and wealth , and become splendid villas covered with cold carapaces of marble and furs of vines . Smells and gurgles of first pots of coffee filtered through the fragrant hedges , and farther away , signals of my brother Jacob 's fresh bread beckoned me , telling me I had returned , reminding and tempting with their sweet siren song . In a photograph of an old landscape , I ascended to my house , walking toward my brother 's hug , my father 's weeping , and my own tears . Return home , you are surely chuckling , my dear , return to the hardships ? The storms ? And the rocks tossed by the giant ? And who are your Circe and Scylla ? And who is the woman waiting ? And what is more hackneyed than the return home ? " Only a book about the return home is more tedious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already wide open , and a rickety-looking truck , its doors gaping , was maneuvering to back into it to load the crates of bread . Only now did I remember that at the entrance to the village I had passed the cemetery and had n't gone to Mother 's and Benjamin 's graves . Inside the yard , the old pickup truck was also parked , the one painted a dreadful yellow that belonged to Romi , my brother 's daughter ; and for a moment my heart stopped because Romi herself appeared on the porch . Fair and tall she is , handsome and broad-shouldered . A cruel prank of yearning . With a single jump she leaped down all four steps and wound her strong arms around my neck . She kissed me on the mouth , tilted her face back , and looked at me with pleasure . She has the face of a boy ; her lips are soft and expressive , and her eyes , wide-set yellow-blue pansies , " a blossom of sky and a blossom of gold , " are laughing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Uncle ? " she breathed into my neck . As soon as I went into the bakery the flour dust tickled my throat again , and the smooth smell of the glaze and the strong , sour taste of the levadura grabbed me , and my brother Jacob 's arms bound my shoulders . What is more emotional than coming back home ? Not even the book that will be written about it . Hugging and crying , we crossed the yard , climbed the four steps to the porch , entered the house , and went down the long corridor to Father 's room . Lying on his bed , his shirt white against his skin , his thin hair combed back , my father 's smile melted into a thin quiver , and became real weeping  | at the corners of his mouth . Ills two withered , hairless hands stretched troll ) the bed as I knelt there before him , pitying , and embracing . The shukikira de raki , the handkerchief soaked in arak , was wound around his forehead as a banner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glue on the envelopes of his letters snuck over to me , the smell of brown age spots blossoming on his hands , the smell of creases etched in his singed neck by the white-hot baking oven and the love fire of Sarah our mother . " Well , he came , Father , " Jacob announced impatiently . " He came , you can take the rag off your head now . Everybody sees you 've got pains , you do n't need to cry . I told you he 'd come . " A thin , delicate little boy was hiding behind my brother 's legs , peeking at us as his fingers played with an old pearl necklace he was wearing . Up to now I had seen him only in the pictures Romi had sent me . " And here 's Michael , " I called . I bent down and picked him up . Jacob , I saw out of the corner of my eye , grew tense . He almost jumped to take his little son away from me but immediately mastered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , I 've made up a room for you . You must want to eat and wash and rest up . " He fixed a salad and omelets , sliced his bread , made sweet coffee with milk . " I 'm as happy as thirty pigs , " I said , and Jacob asked affectionately what book I was quoting from now . " Quick , outside , for a picture in honor of Uncle ! " Romi shooed us onto the porch . " An automatic family picture , " she said , all frenzied activity . She dragged armchairs and little spotlights , stretched sheets on the wall . " You stand next to your brother , " she scolded me . Simon , on the other side of Jacob , held Michael in his arms . Romi took the big pictures of Mother and Benjamin and propped them on Father and Duduch , who sat in the armchairs . She herself stood next to me . All of us fell silent . " Look at the cam-era ! " The hum of the mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blade of the shutter held its breath . " Do n't laugh . Do n't move . Do n't breathe , " ordered Romi . " Whoever moves will turn old in a second . " The picture was taken . Afterward I distributed gifts . I brought Father four kinds of aftershave , two white cotton shirts , and a pair of sealskin house slippers . For my brother Jacob a Stanley toolbox and a state-of-the-art radio that could pick up the distant programs of the early morning hours . As he requested , I brought Michael two costumes , one of the Angel of Death and one of a " regular  | angel , " and all kinds of magic tricks . For Komi , aide from the little Olympus she asked for , I also brought a new tripod , photograph albums of William Klein , Ansel Adams , and I lelen Levitt , and a numbered copy of the series Life and Landscape in Norfolk by F , nierson , which , as you can imagine , cost me a small fortune . For Tia Duduch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I brought a new black dress and black shoes to make her life easier iii old age , and for her son Simon a cane and three kilos of assorted candy . Jacob had prepared the room we once shared . Romi lugged my suitcases there and examined my clothes as she hung them in the closet . " I love the way you dress , " she said . When she saw me groping around , she burst out laughing . " They 're hanging on your neck , dummy . " She came and put my glasses on my nose . She 's as tall as I am , her hair is red like mine , and when she stands in front of me , a sweet breath blows from her mouth straight into my face . She calls me " Uncle , " and when she 's in a good mood or wants to please me ? " Unk the Hunk . " " Let 's pretend , " she said , " that you 're a fragrant mouse and I 'm a hungry cat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that I 'm a Persian rug and you 're a teaspoon . " " When will you bring me a dress instead of a camera ? " " When you learn how to behave . " " I have n't stopped messing you for a minute , " she said . She knew all the stories about her grandmother , even though Sarah had died before she was born , and imitated her with a precision that was scary because they looked so much alike . " And you 're not nice to me , " she announced , turned her back , and went on arranging my clothes in the closet .  | Fifty years passed . Mother  --  sturdy and healthy as an ox  --  is dead . Father  --  small , sickly , and pampered  --  is still alive . The goose has been devoured , the Patriarch 's carriage is crumbling in back of the bakery . Jacob and I grew up , and each of us went his own way . Ile , to sum up briefly , married the woman I had destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , sired three children , and lost his firstborn son . I went to the United States , did n't get married , did n't sire children , and did n't lose any . That , in fact , is the whole story . But  --  and I apologize to you again , my dear , for my tendency to quote ? " detail is always welcome . " Fifty years passed , and the hands of fate did n't make me and my twin brother any more alike . Only the lenses of our glasses remained identical as they grew thicker . I am still a head taller than Jacob , broad and strong and more reserved , and while my thick red hair is laced with only a trace of white , my brother 's black hair is falling out . The years I have spent in a pleasant house , in a comfortable and detached country , in a temperate seashore climate in cotton clothes from Lands ' End , in the arms of amused , amusing , and grateful women , my brother has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , at the closed door of his wife 's room . Like my father and my brother , I also make my living from bread , but I do n't bake it anymore . I write about it . I jettisoned the family tradition of suffering , the inferno of the oven , the heat of the pans , the dead weight of flour sacks . When Mother was alive , she cursed me and called me " traitor , " and indeed , I am a man of words and recipes . Farewell , cracked eyelids and scorched hands . Take away from me the baker 's cough , the fetters of dough . A burner roars , Get out . I 'm sorry if I seem to be apologizing .  | Now I 'm turning my shirt inside out , " Father announces from his room . " Here . . . like this . . . first right and then left . " Old age is returning my father to the fierce battles of children against the rest of the world . He resumes the discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm is to be thrust into the sleeve first , how to aim the sweater so the front faces front . With trembling fingers and weak eyes , he reports for combat . He fights rebellious shoelaces that refuse to be threaded through their holes , mocking shirts that wo n't be buttoned , people who are taller and smarter than he is , who know what 's good for him . Bitterly and at length he consults  --  with me , with himself , with the heroes of his memories  --  about his tendency to toss and turn in his sleep . " What 's the good way to sleep ? Only on the side of the heart . " He imparts his lesson to me . " If you sleep on your stomach , it gives you gallstones , and if you lie on your back , kidney stones . " " What a terrible thing happened to such a little boy , " I heard him murmuring to his reflection in the mirror . I could n't help laughing , despite the obvious anger in Father 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malcontent flesh  --  deserted to his enemies , lay in ambush for him at the Ford Jabbock of his old age , and surprised him every day with new deceits : shaking fingers , shortness of breath and memory , darns of constipation not even his fig-in-olive-oil marinade could loose . And , above all , the pains . Wicked , with no rhyme or reason . " An old man , " he said to me , " does n't see well and does n't taste well and does n't hear well , but pains he feels just like a youth . " Ile prepares like a demolition expert and chronicles his activities . The mumbling words seem to ooze from his skin : " Now I 'm going to the table . . . .  | Slowly , slowly , . , , I cut mysclf a slice of bread . . . . Carefully .... Put margarine on it .... Like this .... And now I 'll sit down to cat .... Chewing slowly . " Worst of all arc the domino games he always loses because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tiles he 's holding in his hand . " Why do you do that ? " I say , flying into a rage and sweeping the tiles off the table . " That 's a secret . The whole point about dominoes is that I 'm not supposed to know what tiles you have . " " Why ? " replies Father joyfully . " It 's not what you think . It 's because I might die any minute , and I want everybody to know what my last words were . " His memory is like mine , alert and strong . Yesterday the spirit moved me , and I went into the kitchen and magically revived Mother 's fruit compote , the one with black plums , slices of lemon , and quince . " The compotes is very got , " Romi said , and we all laughed . That 's how Mother herself would laud her own compote , because Father never bothered to praise it . This time too he ate it eagerly , but its taste resurrected ancient terrors in him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Russkie mare , was lying in wait for him in some corner . He 's a terrified man , anxious and haunted . Every descent from bed is liable to turn into a nocturnal adventure many times more dangerous than his trek through the desert . The dark of night , the frailty of his body , and his poor sense of direction combine to turn the house into one gigantic labyrinth where he ca n't get his bearings . One night , he told me in an embarrassed and furious whisper , he went to the toilet and groped his way back from door to door until he found his room and lay down . A few minutes later he felt a body next to him and was petrified . All night long he lay awake , not daring to move a muscle . Only when the sun rose and its beams penetrated the cracks in the shutter did he look over and see that he was lying in his dead grandson 's bed with his daughter-in-law Leah at his side . He gradually turned his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and encounter other people . It was easier for everyone that way . Simon made him a marble tabletop , shelves for dishes , and a sink . Here he inspects his body , listens to his memories , makes countless cups of coffee on the small gas burner , and offers them to me proudly : " You do n't have coffee like this in America . " As we drink , he tells me again about the dwarves of pain who have invaded his body .  | " The first ones to know a human being is going to die arc his pains , " he said , and then they leave him and go look for somebody else . That 's the way they found me , and that 's the only way they 'll leave Inc . " " They come from outside ? " I wondered . " I thought pains come from inside . " " Outside , " Father affirmed . Later he interrogated me about my own house . " Describe every room in it , " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressed . " Pictures and television and cabinets and sofas ? " " It 's not so much , Father . " " And women of the Covenant , you meet there ? " I smiled . Father saw that a roundabout approach would n't work , and he attacked : " Now maybe you 'll want to get married , maybe you 'll want the bakery ? " " The Leah and the bakery are the Jacob 's . " I imitated Mother too , and Father screwed up his face . " Pustema , " he said , lifting his hand . " Do n't let her come into my room , " he ordered . I felt thin blades of compassion pierce my chest . His memories of Mother were so strong and fresh he sometimes forgot she was dead . " She is n't here anymore , Father . When will you understand that ? " She died one year after I left for America , from a quick virulent cancer , the kind only a body like hers could engender , and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . She can hug me , break my rib , and then the rib cuts the lungs and the spleen . She can choke with her kisses , the cabailla , she 's not like our women . I did n't tell you about Mr. Nissim Alkalay ? How he died from a woman 's kiss ? " He lies on his back in the middle of the bed , and I sit at the foot . His ankle is on my thigh , and I 'm cutting his toenails . In this bizarre position I see that his nostrils have sprouted a fringe of fresh black hair . " Shall I cut the hairs in your nose , Father ? " " Later , " he answers . " First the nails , then the hairs . " The nails of his big toes are yellow and recalcitrant as bone , and Mother 's old pinking shears are the only thing that can cut them . When I finished , he sat up and cut his fingernails . Very slowly he cut them , his tongue poking out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered the crop of cut fingernails into an ashtray and burned them on a  | tiny pyre of matchsticks  --  a remedy against a host of evil spirits that congregate around anyone who cuts his hair or his fingernails . Finally he got up with a groan and aired the room of the stench of his little fire . " Nothing happens the first time anymore , and nothing happens only once in a life . What 's easier to think about ? What will be or what already was ? Now put my shoes on my feet and let 's go to the doctor . Let 's not be late . " I kneel down before him , pull his socks up on his calves , tie his laces with a double knot , as he likes . His conversation , like the endless spaghetti of Saroyan 's barber , unfurls into my ears . In the pain clinic patients were already waiting . " Now I sit down ... . Carefully ... Straighten my leg ... , " Father murmured , collapsing gloriously into an armchair , smiling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They replied with frozen , angry expressions . Like men at a urinal , the patients glance at one another covertly , as if comparing the size of their pain . Each is enveloped in the coil of his torments ; their lips move but their voices are not heard . Migraine sufferers , their pupils tiny as pinheads the only hint of their illness . People with backaches , faces contorted in anticipation of the spasm . People with pancreatic cancer , bent like pocket knives , chests glued to their knees , faces hot and white . Masons of torment , hewing the deadly gravel of bladder and kidneys from their own flesh . Some of them are young , and their pain is training their bodies for distant death ; some are old and their pain is the only relative who still visits them in their isolation . They touch and stroke themselves with such concentration that it 's hard to know if they want to calm the pain or encourage it . " Pain is the razon , " Father explains to me with solemn decisiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubbi whipped Jacob , I understand that for Father pain is merely an instrument of punishment destined for man by the nature of his creation , " like honor and love and memory . " The doctor came out of his office and smiled at Father . He likes him , praises his Hebrew and his appearance . Father 's black trousers are always ironed . His shoes are shined . his shirt is white . You wo n't find old-age spots of soup and urine on his clothes , no faded sediment of sweat or drips of egg yolk . " Come on , Father , " I said , " it 's your turn now . " The patients lifted their faces in envy and resentment , and the doctor , like the angel in charge of torment , raised his hand . " Everyone is in pain , " he said , " everyone . Please , Mr. Levy . " I went in too .  | " I low do you feel , Mr. Levy ? " asked the elector No good , no good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his groin to his stomach . sketching the route of the new pain . Jacob had warned me in advance of the visit . " Just give him an audience , " he said , " and you 'll see what he can do . " With the precision and pride of an inventor , Father described for the doctor the paths of his agonies and their wiles . " First a flicker in my foot , here , a nothing , a little lampa goes on . But by now I know the bastard . Very slowly he creeps , circles , climbs up to my thigh , and from there , with tiny steps , he steals into my guts , settles down , makes himself right at home . A ziara of torments . " " How does he creep ? " asked the doctor . " How does the pain creep , Mr. Levy ? " All patients , he told me later , have a hard time describing their pain in words . Every account begins with " like " ? " like a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots in my flesh . " He has an interesting collection of such metaphors which he records from the patients : " Like a cloud in my stomach , like an ani-mal 's teeth , like small explosions in my head , like black smoke in my liver , like the pain of love but in my leg . Nice , is n't it ? Nice and not clear . There 's an absurdity for you to ponder , Mr. Levy : the metaphor is such a personal thing you 're sure the whole world must understand it . " " There are some things I say that everybody understands . For example , pain is like chains on my hands , " said Father . " But there 's also a pain like a lemon in my shoulder , and there 's a pain like a disgrace in my flesh . My sons do n't understand that , and Your Honor does . " " In fact , pain turns them into poets . " The doctor was moved . " For one upright walk to the grocery store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden treasure to me . The treasure of metaphors . " A naive and friendly man , my father 's doctor , a fool who believes everything .  | A hedge of passion flowers quickly twined around our house . Big blue eyes blinked in it . Beyond it stretched expanses of open , blurry fields , and beyond them a soft , evasive horizon played with our sight . There were mountains too , not far away but yet invisible to our weak eyes ; the only evidence of their existence were the wadis that descended from them and the wind that brought their wild smell . In the new place everything was different . The village was only three years old , its trees had yet to bear fruit , its people had yet to see a blessing from their labor . But for us refugees from Jerusalem delights and wonders were prepared here . New sounds were heard : squeaking mice from the field , trilling falcons from the sky , mooing and neighing from the barns . The hoarse toads of the Jerusalem cisterns gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright shapely bodies , they leaped like dancers in the shallow ditches of water , and they could sing in two voices ? and when the heron 's beak caught them , in three . The most colorful birds  --  the common roller , the bee-eater , and the kingfisher  --  who in Jerusalem , nested only in the glass cabinets in that story about Ernst Grimholz 's taxidermy collection , here hopped among real wild trees near the brook . The crickets , who in Jerusalem sang lonely songs of poverty , here chirped loudly and gladly " a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice . " Blackbirds whistled in field and garden . Jackals and wolves howled in the mountains . Flowers glistened on the earth instead of drying between the olive-wood bindings of albums for pilgrims . Mother was happy . Her hands never stopped working . She did n't seem to need any rest or sleep . All night long she kneaded and baked , and during the day she tended her garden and her house . Every morning I woke to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between : " Ah . . . that 's  | good ... All ... that 's good ! " In my weak childish eves she looked mature , strong , and wise , but now I know that she was not only Noting and ignorant she was twenty-four years old in those days  --  she was also childish Iw nature . More than once she went out to the field to play hide-and-seek , tag , and dodge ball with the village children ; she was very fast and hurled the rag ball boldly and accurately . Her ways were not to everyone 's liking . " People are talking about you , pustema , " Father grumbled . " A woman should n't play like a child in the street . " But Mother pranced around the yard with a surfeit of happiness and strength bubbling up in her flesh , lent her voice to illiterate and funny songs , and chased us when she saw us watching her , pressing us to her heart with the crushing might of her arms . She never understood Father 's hatred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everyone , a distrust that stuck to her like a shadow , followed her from Jerusalem , and slowly took shape again in the conversations of the peasants ' wives in our new place . Jealous eyes began glaring at her , and clenched mouths began hissing out their gall . Behind the bakery she planted a small kitchen garden that gave off smells of garlic , green onions , and tomatoes . She took the heifer to the bull because Father was scared to go near him . Four brooding hens and a rooster pecked around under the young mulberry tree . " The rooster has lot of wives , " she explained the ways of the world to us , " and the goose has one wife . " Isaac Brinker , our neighbor , gave her a white solution , and she plastered the trunks of her seedlings with it . She set useless traps for the rats that were drawn to the bakery storeroom , and cursing loudly she pulled up the weeds that dared grow in the soil of her yard . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several anthills whose inhabitants paved themselves paths of plunder to the storeroom . One day , I 'm ashamed to tell you , I saw her standing over one of the anthills in her loose work dress , hands on her thighs , eyes closed , feet wide apart , a strange expression on her face . When she walked away , a foamy puddle remained on the anthill . I hid , and Jacob , stunned and embarrassed , asked her if she " made peepee on the ants . " Mother glared at him , confused , and finally laughed and said , " No money we got for kerosene , children . " In the new place , no one practiced blowing the shofar and no beadle woke us for penitential prayers before the High Holy Days . Instead , shrieking swallows and flocks of butterflies with black-and-white wings fluttered to us to announce that autumn was coming . Then Mother took us to the fields to see how Isaac Brinker plowed the soil . Holding her hands , we tramped along as hard as our legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | she strode between us . Hcr shoulders and breasts rose and fell as she inhaled the smell of the plowed earth with pleasure . ' the ( lark furrows swallowed the light of the sun and spat it back out soft and dull , velvety and sweet to the eye . Brinker walked behind his Yugoslavian mule , and when he saw us , he began singing in a loud voice . A host of stars is in the sky , Which one gives a sign ? So many lads are passing by ? Which do I choose for mine ? Oh , yes , you 're the one who 's spoken , Yes , yes , you my heart have broken . Ile nodded to us with his pleasant face and smiled at Mother . A good neighbor he was . He gave her seedlings and seeds , taught her to prune , and at her request spent a few nights , armed with his hunting rifle , lying in ambush for the rats that raided the bakery storeroom . He had one son named Noah , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song he heard , and a dried-up wife whose name was Livy , but in the village they called her " Dead Livy " because the stench of carcasses emanated from her . A faint smell , but undeniable and ineradicable . " Dead Livy " did n't leave her house much , but her smell certainly did . Later on , when I started reading books , I called her Madame Thenardier , unbeknownst to Brinker . A few weeks after we arrived in the village , Brinker brought us a copy of the newspaper Davar and read us an item about a meeting between the High Commissioner , Lord Palmer , and the Greek Patriarch , Demianus . The Patriarch did indeed complain to the Commissioner about the theft of his carriage , " and the two also discussed current affairs and the feuds between the Christian denominations in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher . " Brinker and Mother laughed , but Father was scared . He wanted to set fire to the carriage right away . Until that moment it had been merely a shameful memento , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mandatory prosecutor general . Father was always afraid of the authorities , of anyone who wore a uniform , of punctilious officials and health inspectors who invaded the bakery on Friday morning , of all days , to look for rat droppings and signs of cockroaches . Like the greedy kashrut inspector , with his scraggly beard and teeth , and his filthy looks and clothes that got on Mother 's nerves , they too made official records of sins and took a tithe of the challahs . Now the detectives of the C.I.D . joined the ranks of those who were after Father 's life .  | Years later , when I was iii America , the last of the English left the country , and Father breathed a sigh of relict . But in a few months , ( luring one of his fights with Mother , she told him with unexpected cunning that the High Commissioner had left one plainclothes policeman in Israel just for that purpose . For years , in Father 's imagination and nightmares , a ruddy undercover detective would appear in the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nun 's habit that hid his sex and his mission . The detective would confidently stride straight to the carriage , take his penknife and scrape off the peeling gray paint Mother had smeared over the lacquer insignia of the Patriarchate , grab Father by his fringe of hair , and hurl him into the deep dark cellar of the jail in the Russian Compound in Jerusalem . We all laughed at his fears , but one day such a detective did appear at the house and we held our breath even though he was wearing a cap and a vest , not a nun 's habit . The man asked in English about a " woman from Jerusalem , " and I , who knew a little English by then , said , " No ! No ! " with great authority , and he left . Mother was certainly bolder and more practical than Father . She had pulled the velvet bench out of the carriage and made it into a small love seat for the living room ; she had cut off the folding canvas roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it into an awning for the porch . He also took the wooden wheels off the carriage and replaced them with a pair of old rubber auto tires ; and inside the carriage he installed shelves for bread and screen doors . " That 's for you , Frau Levy , " he laughed joyfully . Over the black lacquer and the emblems of the Patriarchate , Mother drew a gigantic ugly loaf of bread that looked like a cross between a potato and a houseslipper . Thus the traces of incense , rosewater , and the chocolate mint candy the Patriarch used to suck on his travels all disappeared . She harnessed the donkey her father had sent between the shafts , and the holy carriage became a bread cart .  | Do you know the Ansel Adams photograph of a hand , an ancient white palm sketched in stone ? On the threshold of our bakery two F palms are imprinted in the cement . One is big and missing the little finger , the other is small and childish , and next to them it says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 . " " He calls this hand The Memorial , " Romi told me . In one of the most terrible pictures she took of her father and sent me in America , Jacob is on his hands and knees , his face to the floor like a dog lapping , his cheeks puffed out , and his eyes shut . Every morning , after taking the bread out of the oven for the fourth and last time , he kneels like that on all fours , takes off his thick glasses , bends down to the cement floor , and blows away the flour that has accumulated in the hollow of Benjamin 's palm ; and every morning Romi lies in wait for him with her camera , as she lies in wait for him in the house , in the kitchen , in the yard , at the graves , at his work , at his rest , in his thoughts , and in his grief . " Someday I 'll do an exhibit , " she told me . " I 'll call it My Father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked at the Adams photograph book I brought her and laughed : " My hand is better . " In her picture the cloud of puffed flour looks like a light mist of fog . The chairman of the Committee of Bereaved Parents , a thin , pleasant man whom Jacob calls the Head Mourner , asked him to participate in erecting a memorial to the dead of the brigade . " They 've got a sculptor from Tel Aviv . A locksmith of junk . Rusty rifles and twisted machine guns . An honest-to-God shame . " Jacob took the Head Mourner to the bakery and showed him the imprints of the hands in the cement . " There , " he said . " That 's him and  | that 's mc , that hand is the memorial and the memorial hok , and that 's all , thank you very much . " Thcy had pressed their hands into the cement the dav- a new floor was poured in the bakery . Everybody was surprised that Jacob made an imprint of his wounded hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually hides it in his pants pocket , and by now that 's not a conscious act but a habit the hand has acquired , to hide like a mole from the light of day and the eyes of its fellow creatures . In the good times , when Jacob married Leah and took over from Father and waited for Benjamin to grow up and inherit it from him , the bakery was a source of pride for the village , and was famous all around . Jacob 's standard white bread , rolls , and challahs were known far and wide . For village celebrations , circumcisions , and weddings my brother baked challahs glazed with egg yolk and sprinkled with poppy seed , breads as big as a baby , delectable and sweet . Those were his gifts to the grooms , the parents , the brides . But ever since Benjamin was killed and Leah closed herself up in his room and went to sleep , Jacob had stopped baking those challahs . At first the people begged him to bake them again , and when they despaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depriving them of their pride and joy . " I do when he 's mad , and Jacob stuck it in his pocket . " We 're bakers ! Always strangers . Always alone . Always night people . " The years I spent in America , comfortable years of tedium and distance , had painted the village in yearning and nostalgia . Memories celebrated their power in me , creating and fostering pictures of shining light and green space , of a happy childhood , of joy and friendship , of the pretty poem Yehiel Abramson , the village librarian , used to teach me English Here it is , without opening a book and with my eyes closed . The days may come , The days may go , But still the hands of memory weave The blissful dreams of long ago . But to myself I admit that Jacob is right . We always were strangers . We clearly sensed the superiority the farmer feels over the baker , tomorrow over yesterday , people of the field and sun over toilers of the oven and stars . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  | Jerusalem from the seed of Abrabanel , " and Brinker said , " ' That 's very nice , Mr. Levu , but we 're all sons of Our Father Abraham . " Offended and frightened , short of build , pupils wide , our father baked his nocturnal bread and lived his owl 's life . When the village woke up he went to sleep , and when the village went to sleep he got up for work . And , in fact , without any dealings with my neighbors , that is how I live today in America , though I do n't bake a single loaf of bread . One afternoon we saw him , my brother and I , standing in the baker 's pit , his shoulders shaking and his head stuck in the oven , and when we approached we heard a terrible shouting , or maybe weeping , swallowed up by layers of brick , mortar , and sand as soon as it came out . And Mother  --  mighty , beautiful , foreign , aggressive  --  here too , she stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we could n't decipher the real nature of the looks people gave her . I thought the women loved her and the men lusted after her . Only now do I understand that the women wanted to kill her and that she did n't stir desire and love in the men but instincts munch darker and more primeval : of hunting , harnessing , domesticating , taming . Every morning she sold bread from a window at the back of the bakery . Customers would stare at her as they pawed the bread and squeezed its flesh . " You could get crazy from thems ! " she would thunder through the window " What you want from poor bread ? Why you squeeze poor bread ? " At the crossroads twines A rose with eyes of red .. . It is Father 's voice , coming from a bench on the street . Jacob , at the breakfast table in the kitchen , dandles Michael on his knee and scowls . ... And she begs All passersby :  | Please , good people , hear my cry , Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Please , hear my cry , Oh , passersby , Pluck me from the brush Lest your feet me crush . Take me to my garden bright , Garden of my heart 's delight . " Listen to him , " says Jacob angrily . " Who is him ? ' " " Stop lecturing me . " " Why do you call him him ' ? Did n't you always get mad when he called Mother her ' ? " I say . " And what do you care if he sings ? Good morning , Romi . I did n't know you stayed here last night . " The kitchen is filled with the force and light of my niece . She stands at the sink and drinks her coffee with milk ; only then does she join us at the table . " Maybe you 'll be nice , Father , and let me photograph you in the stu-dio ? " Jacob does n't answer . He sits Michael on a chair , and Romi stares at him , amused and teasing . " And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael shifts in his seat , filled with that blend of anxiety and anticipation only children can conjure up . " Hey , little boy , what 's your name ? " " Michael , " he says , innocent and smiling . And mine is Romi , " says Romi . " Romi with a T , not a Th . " Michael giggles . " But I know you 're Romi . You 're my sister . " He looks around , enjoying the confusion the game has stirred in him . " Tell me , Michael " ? she dips a piece of bread in Tia Duduch 's tomato juice ? " where do you live ? " Michael 's look lingers on Jacob , who is trembling with anger but has n't exploded yet . " Here . " " Here ? " Romi is amazed . " So how come I have n't seen you here till today ? " " You found somebody to play your games with ? " roars Jacob . " Did you come here to get on our nerves or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titillating dread of the moment . ' And do your parents know you 're here in our house ? " asks Romi . " Maybe you should tell them so they wo n't worry about you . " " Here 's my parents , " says Michael . He gets up and stands next to Jacob . " You 're his father ? " asks Romi . " How come you did n't tell me you had another child somewhere ? " Jacob gets up and opens the door : " Get out ! " " And who 's his mother ? " she shouts from the porch . " You got somebody new on the side ? " " Why does she do this to me ? " Jacob groaned afterward . " Why these games ? Why does she photograph me all the time ? Who did she get this cruelty from ? And you still think she looks like Mother . " " She looks very much like her , only she 's sharper , " I tell him . " Yes . " Crumbs of bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had half of that evil , her life would have been easier . But that 's your specialty , an easy life . We do n't know about such things . " I m one of those who believe that the squawk of a seagull at the Cape of Good Hope can sink a ship in the English Channel at the end of a chain of events . Thus , protein molecules traveled to the origin of my body , sketched the pictures of my childhood , and plotted the course of my life . What if rain had n't fallen that day in the valley ? I shudder at the ( bought . And what if the nymph butterflies had delayed their journey in the desert by one night ? And what if our older sister had n't died ? And not only the annals and nature of my parents and my brother . Also the ringing of the ancient bells , the weeping of a beaten child , the migraine in the head of a man who died before I was born  --  these too reach me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first days in the village we still went around tied together by the red wool string . Later , Mother ordered us to throw it away . " The Rusalem 's  |p96o  ver , " she said , proclaiming her own declamation of independence . We walked to the new school hand in hand , like two blind seeing-eyc dogs , each of us leading and being led at the same time . Our teacher , whose name I ca n't remember for the life of me , held a bright spot in his hand , and passed it over the blackboard with strange rasping noises ; not until recess , when we went up to the board , could we read what he had written on it . " Maybe we do n't see good , " Jacob said to me , and I said , " What are you talking about ? " Two weeks later , when the teacher  --  Shimoni ? Maybe Dr. Shimoni ? It 's been almost fifty years  --  gave back the first arithmetic test , he also gave us a " letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mother , embarrassed . Even though we had both tried to teach her everything they taught us in school , she still could n't read and write . Father took the letter from her , and when he read it his face grew dark . Dr. Shimoni  --  what 's so bad about Dr. Shimoni ? ? wrote clearly and explicitly , and somewhat aggressively , about our nearsightedness ; using rude expressions like " blind as bats " and " do n't see beyond the end of their noses , " he mentioned " serious neglect " and added ironically : " They copy from the board what their eyes see . " Father understood that the authorities , who had only been sticking their noses in his business so far , had opened a new and insulting campaign against him over his sons ' nearsightedness . " Go over there and tell them a baker does n't need to see any farther than the end of his shovel , " he ordered Mother . All night long the argument raged between them , their voices drowning out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burner , and the screech of the pans they dragged . The next morning , when the two of them came home from work , tired and angry , Father stood at the window to sell the bread , and Mother harnessed the donkey to the bread cart and took us to the eye doctor . A cool wind was blowing . Jacob and I opened the screen door , hung our feet from the back of the cart , and let our toes graze the passing weeds . Mother closed her eyes and opened her mouth as if trying to gulp the air , and when we looked at her in amazement , she laughed and said , Ah . . . that 's good ... " The eye doctor asked us if we knew all the letters of the alphabet . When we said yes , he asked if we saw well , and we nodded . Then the doctor pulled back the curtain concealing the official version of the truth : a white board with rows and rows of blackish blurs . That board , which did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim of the authorities : Jacob and I could n't see a single one of the letters on it . ' And the missus ? " The doctor turned to Mother . " Does the missus also want to read the board ? " Mother turned pale . " I see very good , " she said . The doctor put a wooden box on the table , took out round metal frames that weighed heavily on the bridges of our noses , and began inserting lenses in the grooves , asking : " Now ? Now ? " The tiny nebulae on the hoard grew clearer , taking on shape , turning into letters , and the whole world became sharp along with them . As if out of twilight , invisible , unimportant details were born , bursting into my brain , threatening to flood it . My head started to spin and scan , with a force I could n't resist . In the middle of the room the air suddenly crystallized into a pair of tiny specks that turned into two hovering flies . Smoke stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad smell coming from his mouth , and the square on the wall of the clinic turned into a picture of a strange woman , though even with the help of the new lenses you could n't tell if she was naked or clothed . A dreadful , sweet pain swelled behind my eyes , balled up under my forehead , wound around my temples , and drew me from the board to the picture of the woman . I approached her with hesitant steps as Jacob bounded to the window to peer outside . " Look ! Look ! " he shouted ecstatically , pulling me by my shirttail and pointing upward . The chirping we heard had turned into a little scarlet bird hopping on a tree . Three distant dots became people . Two of them curly-haired , in wide khaki shorts , suddenly raised their hands and struck the third until he fell to the ground . From the depths of the sky something floated up and took shape , a yellow-red kite that had n't been there before . I looked at the distant beaten man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I vaguely understood that the new lenses sharpened my vision but shortened its range . Until then , the sky had had no limits , but now it became a clear and opaque shell that even the new eyeglasses could n't penetrate . " But you do n't see the string , " I said . " What string ? " asked the doctor . " Of the kite , " I said , returning to the woman in the picture , and I saw that her breasts , ashamed and fearful under the new force of my eyes , were wide apart . Today I do n't remember if she was a redhead or a brunette , if she was in a low-cut gown or was bare-chested and wore only pants , and a  | few day 's ago , when I took the reproductions of Venus of l-rbino and ( ) dalisque a la culotte grist . out of Inv suitcase and asked Jacob which of than had hung in the eye clinic , he said , " What are you talking about ? What picture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different or if we simply divide it between us . I turned my face to my mother and my grief increased . Whenever she took me up in her arms , I delighted not only in the touch of her body but also in the sharpness of the lines of her face . Until that visit to the eye doctor , that sharpness had seemed a reward for my love . I knew I would never again have to put my face up close to hers to see the little lines at the corners of her mouth and her thin , fair lashes . The doctor brought us back to the table , put drops in our eyes that dilated our pupils until we looked like a pair of owls , peered at us down the knife-like beam of his flashlight , and ordered us to follow his finger with our eyes as it moved from right to left , leaving an almost imperceptible trail of tobacco , chocolate , feces , and soap . Finally he said that despite the external differences between us we were genuine twins . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , four diopters . " That 's pretty strong to start with , " said the doctor , " and it will get even stronger . " And he too scolded Mother for neglecting our health and not bringing us for a checkup sooner . On the way home we saw Isaac Brinker on top of Asphodel Hill , and when we approached he came running down to us . Mother reined in the donkey , and Brinker 's eyes lit up . He climbed into the cart and said , " What 's up , boys ? " Then he gave Mother some autumn crocuses he had picked , and we drove him to the village . I asked what he was doing on the hill , and Brinker said that he went there in the autumn to see the straight lines the squills sketched on the fields . " The ancients marked the borders of their land with those squills . Because the squill always grows in the same place its parents grew and nothing kills it , right ? " Asphodel Hill was a treasure of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its foot irises blossomed in the spring and crocuses at Hanukah , and a lot of other flowers whose names I do n't know . On its western slope grew the shoots of asphodel that gave it its name . Nettles also flourished there , and in school the teacher told us that the nettle is evidence of the existence of ancient life on the land . " It grows where there were houses and people and graves , " he said , and then he smiled and added , " Maybe that 's why it stings . " Mother took us here for walks on Saturday to pick camomile for her shampoo , and sometimes we went as far as  | Skull Rock , au enormous , scary boulder , with clefts that made it look like a human skull from a certain angle .. Now an ugly house stands on that hill , clumsy and white , the kind they call " Spanish style " here . I need all the powers of memory and imagination to identify in its coarse contours the lines of Leah 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , tore down most of it , and rebuilt it in his own bad taste . Most of the village fields are sprouting such houses now , and except for Brinker , none of the old farmers are still here . As I walk through the streets of the village , among the poincianas , the araucarias , and the hedges gardeners have trimmed into balls and pillars , past stone knees , lawns , and swimming pools , I nod a greeting to people I do n't know . But they , it seems , do know me , and have invited me in a few times , introducing me as " a native , an American writer and gastronome , you wo n't believe it , but he 's one of the Levys from our bakery . " Once I was forced to carry on an unpleasant conversation with three loud men who assaulted me with their vulgar aftershave and tall clinking glasses , and demanded that I convince my brother to sell the bakery so it could be torn down . " You know how much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years on that money ... " Instead of ruining his health ... " And ours . " The bakery , which had been built at the edge of the village , is now surrounded by villas , and looks like an ugly mole on the neighborhood 's spanking new skin . Years ago Jacob wrote me that " complaints of the rich " were beginning to be heard  --  about the roaring of the burners and the noise of the kneading belt , which disturbed their rest , about the shouting at work , about the " aesthetic aspect , " and even about the good smell of the bread that burst into their houses , reminding them of their weaknesses and robbing them of sleep . " They never liked us here . Did n't give a damn about us . What were we to them , after all ? Half Frankists , half converts . " And my brother pronounced the word " converts " with the accent on the wrong syllable , the way they were mocked in Mother 's old village . " Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added , reminding me of what I knew very well , that the villagers did n't respect anyone who did n't work the land . " That did n't bother you . You threw away the eyeglasses , you sat in the library and read books . But I saw everything . Father , who worked only at night , so nobody knew what he looked like , and Mother , who drove them  | totally crazy with her body and her Hebrew and her hair and those eves , and Simon and Tia Duduch , with the way they looked ? Did you ever see any of the farmers come visit us ? Except Brinker ? And even he , you know , only came to look at Mother . What did you think  --  he loved you ? " Then my brother said something terrible . He said that Benjamin 's death was his entry into the society of the village . " Only then was I worthy in their eyes , only then did they say to me , You arc our brother . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rats from the holes they dug in the wall of the storeroom . Here and there they left demon 's clawprints on the floury floor and demon 's droppings that spotted the flour . They ruled over the bakery from nightfall to midnight , when the work began . They gnawed sacks , stole flour , gorged themselves on bread and dough , befouled the storeroom , and drove mother out of her mind . These were n't the village rats of the chicken coops and the silos , but vicious , tough city rats full of their own self-importance , who hated the whole world and especially one another . I guess they reminded her of the Jerusalemites , the abomination of her soul . She used to say that a pair of " ratses " snuck into the carriage on the night of the quake and came with us to the village , " ' cause the curse of the Rusalem pursues you every-where . " Father was so scared of the rats that he denied their existence . " It 's a cat , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are cats with thick tails , there are cats without any tails , and there are some like that , small with skinny tails . There are all kinds of cats . I did n't tell you about Jacob Uziel 's blue cat ? " That Uziel , by the way , was a valiant Saloniki man whose approaching fist was the last sight seen by two Janissaries who touched his sister . He was a descendant of Aaron Luis Levy Montezinos , a distant uncle who discovered the Ten Lost Tribes in South America , and " Menashe Ben-Israel himself wrote a book about him titled Hope of Israel . " Father has a host of relatives  --  uncles and forefathers who wrote books , concocted medicines , defended widows and orphans , " knew all the good ways , " recited prayers , " cured the queen of Spain of her husband 's pains , " and always wore red coats when they went to battle so their blood would n't be seen . But Father himself did n't fight , did n't struggle , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rats . When Mother saw a rat in the bakery , her hatred knocked her off balance . With the force of an animal reflex that circumvented the obstacle of thought , she pelted the creature with anything that came to hand , a piece of dough , a glass of milk , a loaf of bread , one of the iron weights from the 100  | scale . Like a daughter of Queequeg or Tashtego , she cast baker's-shovel harpoons across the bakery , threw oil cans and glaze brushes , and since none of those objects was meant for the slaughter of pests , she did quite a bit of damage and infuriated Father . Despite his fearful mutterings , she scattered strychnine in the storeroom , but in vain . She brought Brinker 's rat to the bakery , and the animal returned from battle after suffering grievous losses . She set traps , but the rats waited until a mouse got caught in than , and then they ate it along with the bait . A few times Brinker came to sit with her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to catch any rats either . One night she borrowed the hunting rifle he used to clear jackals and porcupines out of his vineyard , sat down in the yard , and started shooting . In the morning we counted two owls , a big puddle of water from a perforated pipe , three shattered windows , and one dead rat , but nobody understood what had happened to it because it did n't have a single wound . Only once did Mother succeed . One night , a minute or two after Father lit the burner , a rat passed by the pit . Mother noticed it , but she was emptyhanded . The abominable animal assessed the situation correctly , sat down on its behind , and tranquilly cleaned its roguish whiskers and front paws , all the while observing its enemy with a mocking look . A pink blush began climbing from Mother 's collar , growing redder and darker until her face was scarlet with rage . Very slowly her feet slid toward the oven . Four eyes , two big gray ones and two small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close enough to the pit it happened , and even today I have a hard time believing it . Mother flung out a long , powerful hand , grabbed the arm of the burner , tore it off its base , and aimed the tongue of fire at the rat . Two shrieks were heard through the roar of the burner . One , thin and short , came from the rat , now a reeking firebrand ; and the second , longer and coarser , was the roar of vengeance and requital that turned into a terrible wail of pain when Mother 's fingers felt the heat of the burner arm . She flung away her weapon , dipped her hand in the can of glaze , and worked with the other hand all night long , groaning and laughing . It took two weeks for the new eyeglasses to come , and Father and Mother went on arguing and shutting up whenever we came within earshot . Jacob , the Vasco Da Gama of sight , dreamed of the new world that would be revealed before him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing for the invasion of that world into my eyes . Neither of us imagined what was to happen , and I know you 'll be surprised too . Eyeglasses cost a lot of money in those days , and the new equipment for the bakery had used up all our parents ' savings . Father , who  | regarded eyeglasses as an indulgence from the beginning , decided to bus ' only one pair for the two of us . Now I look at that miserable , pitful old man whose bed I was summoned to , and I tell myself that I do n't know anyone else who would have dared to come up with such a wicked idea  --  to force two nearsighted children to share one pair of eyeglasses . " At last you remember something right , " said Jacob when I reminded him of that . He called Father " a cheap creep , " but I am grateful to him . I have no doubt that with that decision my father set the course of my life more than any other person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than Yehiel Abramson , the librarian , whose time to enter the story is approaching , and more than all the women who have shared their souls , their beds , their lives , and their hearts with me . I am grateful , and full of love for those women and for Father , who by dint of that tight fist of his brought me together with every single one of them . Two weeks later , we got our one pair of eyeglasses , with round steel frames . As if we had decided in advance , Jacob put them on immediately and strode outside like a conqueror . The children called him " four-eyes " and " glasses-head , " but he paid them no heed , just as he paid none to me . I was left content at home , and I was relieved when I realized that our parents were n't intervening in the way we shared our eyeglasses . My brother devoted most of the next weeks to learning the world anew . He stood close to every object , took off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar blurry sight to the sharp and alien new one . I accompanied him as he mastered the way from home to school and back . He skipped and ran around me , enthusiastically describing all the new details of our route , which were completely superfluous as far as I was concerned , oppressing my eyes with their claims , demanding constant attention , competing with imagination , and exhausting thought . I suppose the animosity I feel for sharp-sighted people , those arrogant tourists visiting my hazy world , was born in those days . To this day I think that blurred vision is the proper vision for a civilized human being , who no longer needs the eyes of a hawk , the ears of a bat , or the nostrils of a dog . Eyeglasses , which I still wear little and lose a lot , seem like a pair of superfluities fit only for hunters , peeping Toms , and rich people . We looked like the two puppies of Lycurgus of Sparta . Jacob played with his friends in the yards and fields , wrestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp sights that surrounded him , and I let him live in his world and did n't interfere with his happiness . Even after summer vacation ,  | when we went back to school , we did n't fight . In the classroom we sat next to each other and passed our one pair of glasses from nose to nose , to the great anger of the teachers and the laughter of the children . At recess , the eyeglasses were Jacob 's , because he would play in the yard and I would read books . The only time fights broke out between us was when the man who showed movies came in his pickup truck . Once I was even forced to exercise my superior physical strength to gain the eyeglasses . Jacob started crying and insisted I describe to him what I saw . After that he did n't demand the eyeglasses anymore because he said that the movie , blurry as it was , was more interesting accompanied by a story ; and the little children , too , whose impatient parents were n't willing to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my description . Once , at a Buster Keaton Indian movie , I could n't resist temptation and told him the Indian bared his belly and put it to the ground . " That 's how Indians listen for horses galloping or a train coming from the distance , " I explained to hint A year ago I got a letter from him that began with the words " You liar , you . " He wrote me that Romi had taken him to see The Blue Angel in Tel Aviv and he saw that it was Marlene Dietrich who showed her legs in the wings of the theater , not the professor , as I had told him then . For two years my brother and I shared one pair of eyeglasses . And until they bought us another pair , the common pair served its purpose . No longer did we walk hand in hand ; each one of us went his own way and lived in his own world . The village library . Joy of my childhood , sanctuary of my youth , my heartbeat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nights , but there has to be a limit even to courting you . A large library it is , strange and rich . It 's still standing today near the community center , but now the center has been turned into a big club humming with young people , and  | next door there is a small splendid shopping center built on the ruins of the silo , a twinkling of neon and glass , indicating the passage of tune . For a few minutes I stand there , enjoying measured doses of excitement and examining my memory . Here Leah passed by on her hike , a laughing , youthful Persephone , her braid bouncing on her hack and her smile rising on her face . Here the donkey used to rub his back on the pillar . Here stood Isaac Brinker , who was so impressed by the goose 's devotion to Mother that he declaimed Rilke 's poem on Leda and Zeus to her in German , in the middle of the street , concluding with a fervent explanation : And only with her , Frau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Only with her ! " Most of the other farmers have already slipped my mind . Reading and baking are n't occupations that create a loyal circle of friends . The path my feet trod was short and clear , stretching from the house to the bakery and the library . Here and there rumors penetrated the walls of flour and the bookshelves . We heard the gossipy conversations of those who bought bread , but we did n't take part in their plowing and harvesting , their quarrels and loves . We knew that Binyamini grew the biggest beets for fodder and that Slutzki was persecuting his neighbor , threatening to kill him with a pitchfork , but we did n't interfere . We were bakers , enclosed in the narrow realm of night and oven , defended by a wall of fire and bricks , in another time , in thick darkness . " Such sociomaths , the two of you , " Romi teased her father and me . And you 're getting to be just like him , " she added . " Standing still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you two remember and walk at the same time ? " She came up to me , thrust out two deft hands , and suddenly took the glasses off my nose . " You look better without , " she said . " So we can see your beautiful eyes . " " Give them back , " I said . " I do n't like these games . " " Right away , Unk . You 're a real hunk like that . " " Do n't make me resort to violence , as the diner said to the oyster who refused to be opened . " I smiled , but anger was rising in me , dim and blunt . " Right away , okay .... You 're hurting me ! Here ! What 's with you ? " In the library there was no need for eyeglasses . All you had to do was put your nose to the shelves and push it along the rows like a plow . Small and sharp , the words soared to my eyes , and the good smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how I read even now , though I have my own eyeglasses.  | " I grew up , a happy , healthy child in a bright world of illustrated hooks . " Thick ivy covers the walls of the library Under a brow of green leaves the closed wooden door looks like the eye of a sleeping animal . " Monday and Wednesday , " says a note taped to the old brass sign , " from four to six p.m . " It used to be open every day from three to seven , and on Friday from ten to one . Almost all the books in it came to the village with Yehiel Abramson , and many of them were sold or stolen or disappeared after Yehiel was killed . Ychiel Abramson ? " Founder and First Librarian " ? was a friendly , generous man , tall , with muscular white hands and a lean , bespectacled face . He immigrated to this country from New York and was so unlike the people of the village that as a child I thought he was different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , I saw many people like Yehiel , and for a moment I thought I had landed in a country of librarians , until I remembered Emerson 's saying that air and land , principles and diction determine the lines of a man 's face no less than his parents do . Yehiel came to the village a few months before us , driving a green Dodge truck loaded with five enormous wooden crates containing the forty thousand books of his late father , Judge Mordechai Elijah Abramson . Out of the crates came volumes in Hebrew , English , Yiddish , German , and Russian , along with ancient manuscripts added to his wonderful collection by this talented autodidact , a Monastirial born by mistake in the Ukraine , endowed with insatiable curiosity , fine literary taste , and a practical knowledge of binding and moth control . " In one and the same year we got bread and books , " said Brinker , who , like me , was a constant patron of the library . " Take a book for your mother too , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to tell him that Mother did n't know how to read and write . I often read to her . She would listen attentively , mouthing the words , and keep asking for the part in Michael Strogov where Ivan Ogareff heats his sword , the gypsy girls of Nijny Novgorod dance , and Michael stares at his mother Marfa . " Look while you may , look while you may ... , " she repeated after me . " Look while you may ... " And her own eyes filled with tears . In the two years before he came to us Yehiel Abramson wandered through the country in his green truck of books , trying to interest libraries and institutions in his father 's legacy . Many wanted to take parts of it , but in his will judge Mordechai Elijah Abramson had stipulated that his collection was not to be dismantled . Yehiel explained that to his father , an observant Jew , that would be like performing an autopsy on his corpse . His areas of interest were many and varied , and libraries interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Falashas had no desire for the pamphlets of Israeli and Feldman on artificial methods of fertilizing dates Someone who wanted Karaite Vocalization by Siniha husker and T'udat Shlomo by Shlomo ben Moshe I lazan , in the rare and expensive edit ion of 1718 printed in Amsterdam , did not want the complete Almanac of Utah for the Mormon Farmer by Jefferson Hope . Those who desired Ma'asuh Tuvia by Tuvia Hacohen of Metz and Even Bohan by Kalonymus had no interest in the rare and terrifying copy of the Kalevala written , as Yehiel whispered to me , on parchment made of human skin . He was a pedantic librarian . Everyone who took out a library card had to raise his hand and swear an archaic loyalty oath and agree to weird prohi-bitions  --  not to drip candle wax on the pages , not to dog-ear them or dry flowers between them . On the wall of the library Yehiel hung the tablet of " House Rules " and next to it a portrait of his father . The oil painting of the judge was done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the painter 's face reflected in the space between the twinkle of the judge 's eyes and the glint of his glasses . With polka-dotted bow tie , white goatee , Druze mustache , and abundant curly gray hair , Mordechai Elijah Abramson peered through round gold eyeglasses at everyone who came into his library , proud of his wonderful collection , his devoted son , and his great resemblance to the poet Shaul Tshernikhovski . He and his son were both very fond of Tshernikhovski , whose books , signed in his own hand , are still here , in a cabinet with locked glass doors . For my bar-mitzvah Yehiel gave me a book of his poems , in the splendid " Moriah " edition of Odessa , and when I opened it a small brass Yale key fell out . My heart stopped . It was the key to the library , and I knew that would be the happiest moment of my life . Do you know many people who can say as much about a moment of their lives ? Forty-two years later I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dim silence reigns in the library . The sense of smell  --  trigger of memories ? is released in me when I enter and walk around among the shelves . From both sides of the ancient House Rules , two countenances now look at me , the old one , painted and familiar , and the second a painful photograph of Yehiel , " who gave his life for the defense of Jerusalem in the battle for SanSimon in the War of Independence . " I went there too , with Romi , on a pilgrimage of memory . A small green bell tower stands there , surrounded by cypresses and pines , and to the side the wreckage of a tank , monkey bars for children , and Yehiel 's name on the memorial plaque , among the other  | dead . Youngsters in wheelchairs were riding back and forth . " ' Like my picture , take my picture , " they called to Romi . The first book Yehiel gave me to read was Wild Animals I Have Known , by Ernest Thompson Seton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English yet ? " " No , " I said . " Why do n't you wear glasses ? " he asked when he saw me stick my nose between the pages . " ' Cause this is how I like to read , " I answered . Every day I came to borrow a book , sometimes twice a day . One day Yehiel said to me in his American accent , Approach . Do you read all the books you take ? " " Yes , " I told him . He examined the book I was returning . " This is a bit too advanced for you . " His face grew serious , and then he smiled and opened the book to its last page . " Tell me , what were Peter 's last words ? " " Friends , ' " I declaimed , " ' confess that with us perishes ? ' " " Then what ? " " It does n't say , " I answered in embarrassment . " He dies . " " Fine , " said Yehiel . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I quoted . " Last words , " Yehiel informed me solemnly , " are the most important . All wisdom , and all truth , and all sincerity are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible . " I was too young to understand , but I was very moved ; and a few years later I discovered where the sentence came from and about whom it had been written . You surely remember Kurtz 's last words : " He cried in a whisper at some image , at some vision  --  he cried out twice , a cry that was no more than a breath ? ' The horror ! The horror ! ' " I browse through the old books . On the inside of the covers appears that plate with the fat chicken wearing glasses , hatching a closed book . Yehiel explained to me that that was his father 's ex libris and said , " That is the most faithful reflection of him . " " That chicken ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . That 's an owl , symbol of wisdom , " laughed Yehiel . " But Father insisted on drawing his ex libris himself . " He told me that his father had steeped himself in reading from his earliest childhood , and that books destroyed first his eyes , then his relations  | with his wife , and finally his vertebrae . " My father , " he added proudly , " came harm Kharkov to New link when he was five years old and learned English all by himself . " When he was six , Mordcchai Elijah Ahramson asked passersby where the public library was . 1Ic entered and fearlessly asked the librarian for the first book on the bottom shelf . When he brought it back the following day , he asked for the book next to it , and then the third and the fourth , and thus he read the whole shelf . The library was arranged alphabetically by authors ' names , and by the time the librarian had discerned this strange method of reading , the child had already read Aasen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a considerable part of the hundred and eighty books in Abbott 's dreary Rollo series . From then on the librarian took him under his wing and taught him to be more discriminating . " If every youth would make friends with a librarian , a science teacher , and a tall and indulgent woman , the world would look completely different , " said Yehiel . The judge amassed his own library with persistence and talent . He aided Jewish immigrants in exchange for the books they had brought with them , he bought , he traded , he found , and he stole . And when he died , he left his son that legacy  --  to move his library to the Land of Israel . Yehiel bought the green truck , loaded it and the books on a ship , immigrated to Palestine , and embarked on his trek of trials and tribulations . He despaired of the National Library at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , which was interested in only a small part of the collection , slammed the door on the way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eel Yosef after the kibbutz members found " harmful bourgeois material " in ais books . For a time he put his trust in the people of Rishon Le-Tsion , until he discovered that they were n't interested in the library but in the : ruck . In the end , weary and angry , he came to our village . Under Brinker 's ) ressure , the village administration agreed to accept the complete collec-:ion and to give Yehiel accommodations and regular work as librarian , but : hey imposed a condition on him : he would have to sell a few rare books to : inance the construction and maintenance of the library . Yehiel had no choice and consented , writing a letter to England that brought an arrow dispatched in the form of a mustachioed nun who was none other than a secret agent of the Bodleian Library of Oxford . For an enormous sum the nan bought the Mishneh Torah of the Rambam , printed in Venice in 1550 , he Sefer Torah Or of the Ba'al Shem Tov , the Esperanza de Israel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yosef Albo ,  | printed in Soncino ( Alb() was also a distant uncle of my father 's , if you can believe his stories ) , and the Voyage de la hake , la Sctmurie , la Galilee et le Libhun , by a scholar named Cardinal Beaudoin of Avignon , a book that was n't so ancient but was an extremely precious find , with a strange , very thin bookmark of delicate , shining skin preserved between its pages . After the deal was concluded and the five rare books sailed for England , hidden in a corset under the black habit of the Oxford agent , Yehiel took pains to divulge publicly the fact of their sale and derived great enjoyment from the shock of the important gentlemen of the National Library , who hastened to the village in a private cab and inveighed against " the pursuit of lucre and the delivery to foreigners of inalienable goods of the culture and legacy of our people . " " You could have got them for nothing , " said Yehiel to Professor Heinrich Reiss-Levy , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a crazed locust , flared his nostrils , and demanded that Yehiel let him into the library . Three years earlier that very same man had gone over the list of Mordechai Elijah Abramson 's books , wrinkled those very same nostrils , and stated that he was n't interested in the complete collection . " Despite a few impressive items , your father 's collection is simply an example of the delusions wealth is liable to engender in the soul of a talented dilettante , " said the professor to the embarrassed son , and when the latter protested the insult , Reiss-Levy rang the sort of little bell Berlin children use to call their governesses on stormy nights , and had his guest shown out . That epithet ? " talented dilettante " ? made a great impression on me because Yehiel spat it out with a special grimace whenever he told me the story . Only years later did I understand that it was censure and not praise , but at the time I was old enough to understand that I was also a talented dilettante , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , my dear , and even used the same word about the description of Alexandria in the story of Zoga and Anton . But if Mordechai Elijah Abramson had n't been a talented dilettante , the Hebrew University library would have been glad to accept his books , and then Yehiel would n't have come to the village and I would n't have known him or found refuge in his library and become a talented dilettante myself . Thus the ship sinks in the English Channel because of the seagull 's squawk at the Cape of Good Hope , and thus my life too revolves , and here I am before you  --  a dilettante . A cunning hunter . Who makes savoury meats . A talented man . In love , in memory , in deceit , in repentance.  | At the end of the corridor , behind the last door , in the room that was Benjamin 's room , in the bed that was his bed , Leah sleeps . From time to time I pass by the closed door , and I automatically lower my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infant 's cradle or a dead man 's tombstone . But nothing rouses Leah from the netherworld of her slumber , and the room is closed , as Jacob grumbles , because her sleep disturbs those who are awake . " Go on , go in and look at her , " he told me when he saw me lingering and wondering at her door . " You were friends once , were n't you ? Maybe you 'll manage to wake her up . " When Michael was two years old , he went into his mother 's room and asked Jacob , " Who 's that ? " " That 's Leah , " my brother said . That answer , the cruelest , most logical reply , satisfied Michael completely , and for a year and a half he did n't ask for any further explanations . Sometimes he 'd say , " I 'm going to sleep with Leah , " and he 'd get into her bed , huddle against her back , put his cheek on her shoulder , and fall asleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I hate that he gets close to her at all . " Not until he was three and a half did Michael ask where his mother was . They were eating lunch , and before Jacob had time to open his mouth , Romi said , " Leah is your mother , Michael , and mine too . " Jacob flew into a rage , and Romi said to him , " You could have thought about that sooner , before you told him , That 's Leah , ' and before you raped her . " Jacob slapped her . Romi flushed and said , " You watch out , I 'm the Tartar too , " and this time , though the imitation was perfect , she did n't laugh . A week after I came , I dared to go in.  | Leah lay like a big sack under the shroud of the blanket , amid t he hovering particles of flour and ( lust , faded posters of actresses and motorcycles , a pair of army pants she had laundered for Benjamin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cave hung in the room . Naturally she did n't wash much . One clay , my brother told me , he ambushed her as she was groping her way on her daily sortie to the toilet , tore her nightgown off , thrust her into the shower , and stood there with her in his clothes under the stream of water . He scrubbed her furiously , almost flaying her , and she leaned her wet head on his shoulder and let him soap and rub her , shampoo and dry her . Once , the water had raised a good smell of rain from her skin and hair , a smell that used to rouse my brother , make his heart stand still , and fill him with love . " But now , " he said , " she stinks like an old mop . " A stifling dimness silenced the room . I pulled the blanket back a bit and looked at her face : that mummy of my love , preserved in the amber of her grief . Once , Leah had had a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and I never saw one like it again afterward . Later , she cut off her braid , but now her hair has grown again and lies in bed with her like an independent living thing . Her skin is white and spongy because of her prolonged contact with the dark , her cheeks are pasty from the stagnant air . " The bright Tammuz ... " I seek refuge from my sorrow . " The bright Tammuz , the Tammuz is dead . " The first time I saw that face it was framed in the window of a moving car . I was twelve years old , and every morning I would go out to deliver bread . The donkey dragged the Patri-arch 's carriage through the sand , his little hooves digging in and pulling out , while I stuck my nose in The Pickwick Papers , my whole body shaking with laughter provoked by the sayings of Sam Weller . All of a sudden an elegant car appeared , a Ford coming toward me , raising reddish dust in the main street of the village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back window . The tires made a pleasant hiss in the sand , and a smell of gasoline and hot metal came from the body of the car . Children burst out of all the yards and ran behind it , and I prodded the surprised donkey , rushed home , grabbed the eyeglasses , and climbed a tree . The car reached the end of the street , turned onto the rutted path leading to the fields , and easily took the grade of Asphodel Hill . A man , a woman , and the little girl got out and observed the view . Even from a distance you could see that the man was very tall , thin and fair-haired , and the woman wore a suit and leaned on him too much . The little girl , in a flowered dress with a white collar , pranced around them . That was Leah.  | Sleep split her face into youth and old age . Her forehead is arched and smooth , still shining with that gleam , but the slope over her mouth is a map of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parched skin , like the lips of a thirsty child , and the two hairs in the small thole on her chin , which she used to ask me to pluck out with tweezers , have grown long and thick , as if they were pushed out by the pressure of her pain . There is no sorrow on her face , only a weariness even dreams despair of and no sleep can satisfy . I paid you with my sad heart 's blood , With despair and belated solace , With the soul of my longing mood ? I paid you everything you gave me . Please , from your curse , now save me . Please , from your curse , now save me . I grabbed the blanket and yanked it off . Leah stirred , groping as if she wanted to get back under its warmth , and then she huddled up , drawing her knees into her belly and clasping her hands between her thighs , as if she was trying to turn her body inside out like a glove , to gather herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I felt like I 'd been struck in the groin . Only a shining cataract lit them , like the gleam stretched over deep dreams . The eyes looked at me , went out , and closed . " It 's you ? When did you come ? " she whispered . " A few days ago . " " Do n't be mad at me . " " Get up , Leah , " I said . The door opened and Simon appeared . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . " Get lost , Simon , " I said . " This is none of your business . " " Why did you uncover her ? " He came up to me . " Do n't worry , " I told him . " I did n't do anything to her . " " That 's Jacob 's wife , " said Simon . " I 'm gon na tell him . " " Simon . " I sat down on the edge of the bed . " You can tell whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you then too , when Jacob went to Tia Sarah 's family , " said Simon . " I saw and I heard . " We have always been suspicious of one another , from the day he came to us , a misbegotten child , crippled and ugly , and time , as we know , far  | from erasing first impressions , only reinforces them and supplies them with proof . " I , isten carefully , you dummy , " I said to him . " I did n't do anything with Leah . Not then and not now . More than thirty years have gone by . We 're all grown up now , we all know everything , and anyway , what are you doing here , in this room ? " " I came to change her sheets , " said Sirnon . " I do that every week , and my mother washes them , and now you go take care of your father . That 's why they called you to come , is n't it ? " " Do n't be fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I punished you once , in case you 've forgotten . If you want to find yourself tied to a tree again , just say so . I have n't forgotten how to do it . " Simon 's neck became wet . The pain of his crushed thigh makes his sweat smell like the sea . His shoulders and ribs expanded . He leaned forward , looking like a direct descendant of Cherokee the bulldog and Quasimodo the hunchback . " That 's what family is , " he said . " You protect and take care of . You do n't go to America . " He stooped , not taking his eyes off me for a minute , picked the blanket up off the floor , and covered Leah . " Get out of here now , " he said . " I have to go get Michael from school , and I wo n't leave you alone with her in the room . " So many people have confided in me . My brother wrote me amazingly candid letters . Tia Duduch entrusted me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yehiel 's old uncle , I catalogued hundreds of love letters by woman , date , and " miscellaneous . " Oh , that " miscellaneous " . . . Two days ago Michael revealed to me the " magic words that explode stars , " and it seems to me that you also entrusted a " little secret " to me in your next-to-last letter . But I have never forgotten the  | clay when Yehiel lifted the hinged counter in the library and said , " Yana call come in now and choose your hook vow elf . " In the blurry village street , children ran around , had dust-ups in the dust , and poked fingers in each other 's faces , shouting " I lands up ! " And in the library Yehiel told me riddles , taught me the English alphabet , and trained me in techniques of repetition and memorization . Fven now , when I read a book , I list in the margins the names of the characters in order of appearance , sketch family trees , and draw lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The investment is small and the profit large , as the flower vendor said , advising the suitor to bring his beloved a single rose instead of a pair of diamond earrings . A short time later Yehiel allowed me to return books from the tables to the shelves , dust them , and air them , and started teaching me to read and write in English . Together we read The Little Engine That Could , and Yehiel was amazed at how fast I learned the language . He introduced me to the books of his native land , and when I came to America I did n't come as a foreigner , like Mottl the son of Peysi or Karl Rossmann . He quoted to me from Emerson and Thoreau , decreed that Mark Twain 's best book was not Huckleberry Finn but Pudd'nhead Wilson , said he " respected " Whitman and Faulkner , vilified Louisa May Alcott , and announced that an " important young talent " was growing in America and his name was William Saroyan . I let him mold my taste , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have entire branches of literature , but who can read everything ? Even you , my dear , did n't identify more than a third of the quotations and allusions that appear in the pages I have already sent you . Yehiel 's own favorite books were a saccharine novel about the suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf in the lodge at Mayerling and the myth of the miner of Falun , in Hoffmann 's version , which he forbade me to read . " That 's not a story for adolescents in love with their mothers , " he told me . But Brinker said , " That 's a nice story for children who love their mothers , " and he took the book out for me . On the way home he explained that it was a true story about a Swedish miner who perished in the collapse of the famous copper mine of Falun , and whose body was discovered fifty years later , embalmed in vitriol of copper and preserved in its youthful vigor as on the day his soul took wing . Yehiel memorized The Sorrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it in the original , and I even suspect him of secretly holding on to a blue-yellow " Werther suit , " like other devotees of that bother-  | some , bawling , tedious lover . One day Yehiel denounced and defamed the mocking poem by William Thackeray about Werther 's love for Charlotte . Years later , when I reprinted iii my bread book the passage in which Charlotte slices the loaf of bread , I also included Thackeray 's poem . Suddenly I was gripped by a great uneasiness , even though Yehiel was dead by then and perhaps precisely because of that , and so I did n't use the last mocking stanza , only the first . Werther had a love for Charlotte Such as words could never utter . Would you know how first he met her ? She was cutting bread and butter . There were some subcollections in the library : photos of movie actresses , not all of which he let me see , as well as a set of beautiful ink drawings and watercolors of wild animals of North America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Seton 's books are still in the library , and rouse instincts of theft and redemption in me . To you I shall reveal that I have already made use of the old key , and a few days after my arrival I filched the drawing of the American fishhawk , the osprey . That was merely the closing of a circle , since in my childhood I would stare at it in the library , and now I follow it from the window of my house in Cape May on the Atlantic coast as it plucks its prey from the sea and washes its murderous claws in the waves . But more than anything else Yehiel loved his " Collection of Famous Last Words . " I was too young to understand when he declaimed to me , in his New York accent , the verses of Shakespeare he recorded in his fine handwriting at the beginning of every one of the albums of his collection . 0 , but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony . Where words are scarce they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that breathe their words in pain . He recited in English , then closed his eyes and with a shy smile declaimed his own Hebrew translation of Shakespeare 's words . He was so excited about that translation of his that he hung it on the announcement board at the entrance to the library , between the list of new books that had arrived and the library hours . The next day an inscription appeared under-  | neath : " Do n't let Yehiel Abramson translate me into Hebrew  --  the last words of William Shakespeare . Yelriel was outraged . " Coarse brutes ! " he cried . " ' They 've got no shame and no culture ! " And he took his albums out of the metal cabinet , leafed through them like a madman until he noticed me watching him , and began reading to me from them . My childish brain absorbed and preserved , collected . and guarded . Lines , stories , sentences , and facts  --  unintentionally I even remember most of the last words I heard back then . Not only wellknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " ' lb bring you down at the hands of Aeacus great royal son . . . Achilles ! " ? but also curiosities like the words of the opera composer Rameau to the priest who heard his confession : " Stop chanting your prayers , you 're off key ! " Or of the zoologist Georges Cuvier to the nurse who applied leeches to his skin : " Nurse , it was I who discovered that leeches have red blood , " he said , and died . With a broad grin , Yehiel read me the last words of Benjamin Disraeli and with tears in his eyes quoted the ornithologist-poet Alexander Wilson : " Bury me where the birds sing . " " Go play with the children a little , " he said finally , and put his albums back in the cabinet . " It 's not good for a child to be among books all the time . " I 've been home a few weeks now . With Father , who never stops corn- " plaining about his torments , I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Romi I laugh and fight . " Let 's play that you 're raw lettuce , Uncle , and I 'm a crazy rabbit . " " Let 's play that you 're Dolores Haze and I 'm Dolores Dark . " " Stop trying to impress me , you pain in the neck . " " Your mother would have understood that . " " So go to my mother . "  | You understand too ? Do n't volt ? A few nights ago , as I ! al , ' cradled in the last flickerings of wakefulness , the door of the room suddenly opened , and Father 's small , bent silhouette groaned on the threshold . I le stood still , and it took me a few seconds to realize that he did n't see me at all . Ile coughed , put his hands on the wall , and groped his way along , and when he came to the closet door , he opened it , dropped his pajama bottoms to his ankles , and peed inside . The scant , continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes , and I did n't dare disturb him . I did n't sleep all night , and in the morning I drew a shiny white stripe on the floor from the foot of Father 's bed to the door of his room , and from there down the hall to the toilet . " Follow this line , you see ? " I said to him . " It will lead you to the toilet and back . " Jacob , to my surprise , did n't say a thing about the stripe except to ask , " What 's that ? " and when I explained it to him , he smiled . Tia Duduch caresses me , gives me her wonderful masapan , cooks me her delicious meals as if I had n't eaten a thing since the day I left home . Sometimes she grabs my hand and puts it on her chest , which she suddenly bared one evening , as she used to do when we were kids , and I was startled . The teeth of time , which have gnawed all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar , a memorial to its amputated sister , is still there next to it , but the breast is beautiful and shapely , and its glow has n't vanished . When I gave her the black clothes I brought her from America , she beamed . She went to her room to put them on , and Romi photographed her as she slowly twirled in front of the picture of Uncle Elijah , whose insanely jealous eyes have never stopped following her even from beyond death and behind glass . Their son Simon glares at me with the grudging eyes he glared at me with thirty years ago . He did n't inherit the curiosity and lust for knowledge ascribed to his father . His temperament is loyal and gloomy , his body strong and cunning like a pit bull . Every day he takes Michael to school and brings him back home , leaning on the new cane I brought him and leaving deep holes in the sand . At recess he makes sure Michael does n't participate in rough games and does n't get hurt . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crouched on his crippled thigh in a corner of the schoolyard , reached into his shirt pocket for the plastic soapbox in which he kept a blue pack of cheap Silons , pulled a cigarette out , and tapped it on his thumbnail . His eyes rummaged around , and smoke belched from his mouth . " He 's  | the last man in Israel who still smokes those stink bombs , " says Jacob affectionately . " I think they keep an assembly line at the facture just for him . " Whenever Jacob and I laugh , Simon slit inks . Whenever I approach Leah 's closed door , he rushes up and glares at inc . " It 's hard for him , " says Jacob . " I lc thinks you 're trying to join the family again . " Sometimes I have to remind myself that my brother is wiser and crueler than I think . From the yard the joyous shout of Michael returning from school is heard , and Jacob hurries to the door . Michael has a merry gait , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he waves both arms as if he 's trying to take off . " We 're angels ! " he calls . " We 're flying . " His fearsome guard limps behind him , chained to the ground with the weights of his pain and disability . Jacob knelt down and hugged his son , then straightened up and opened Michael 's schoolbag . " You did n't finish the rolls I made you , " he said . " I 'm very offended . " Every night he bakes two small , funny rolls for Michael , with raisin eyes , yellow sesame-seed smiles , and big poppy-seed mustaches . Then he said to me , " Give us a few minutes , " and disappeared into the bedroom with Michael . " He 's all right , " he said when they came back , and served us lunch . He warned Michael that the soup was hot , and he did n't take his eyes off him , chewing and swallowing in time with his son . " The child looks like Elijah , " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russkie , and he turned out like the Monastirial . " Michael is a thin , delicate boy whose body is stronger than it looks and much stronger than Jacob thinks . Every morning he bursts out of the house barefoot , in a thin nightshirt , runs across the yard holding his clothes and his shoes , and comes to get dressed in front of the oven , which is long dead by then but still gives off heat . He goes down to the pit , takes off his nightshirt , and stretches . Darkness reigns in the small bakery . The low sunbeams sketch lines of silver and gold in the flour dust , which never settles , and illuminate blotches on his body . When he saw me he did n't say anything , but he smiled at me from the pit , and I was embarrassed . Where did that child take shape ? I ca n't figure him out . His countenance is open and pleasant , but his smile is a transparent wall I ca n't get beyond . His face is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and very pensive . He has none of Mother 's and Romi 's stormy power , none of Leah 's soft gleam , and none of Jacob 's scorched taciturnity . He 's not like Benjamin  | either . His back and rib cage remind Inc of Father , of all people , brit kit her keeps claiming , " ' I'hc bov is like Elijah of blessed memory . " This week Ta Duduch started teaching Michael the art of making masapan . Do n't make light of this . The women of the levant keep the secrets of masapan from two interested parties : hateful women and loving men . But Jacob and I , Benjamin and Michael , each in his turn , won this lesson of grace and even learned the most arcane secret of all  --  to recognize the punto de masapan , the moment when the ground almonds are to be added to the melted sugar . This punto is a slippery sliver of time that ca n't be captured by the hands of a clock or cut by a camera shutter . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between taking the piece of meat out of the pan and carving it on a platter is the shortest long time , while the punto de masapan is the longest short time . But DeVine always looked for meanings where they were yesterday , and in his Big Book of Stuffings , he wrote this nonsense : " We must n't forget that the eggplant lends a framework to the stuffing but the stuffing lends significance to the eggplant . " I much prefer good old Konrad , the pastry chef from Lubeck and self-styled " technician of sweetness , " who researched and confirmed scientifically that the duration of the punto de masapan is " like the duration of a thought about a wink . " One way or another , it 's the moment when the cooked sugar syrup reaches the right stage between liquidity and viscosity , one of the most ancient compromises the human heart has pondered , something you , I am sure , will understand better than I. After all , it was you who wrote me about reading as opposed to memorizing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the charm of wooing as opposed to the dead weight of jealousy . A few days before making masapan , my aunt is like a nervous brood hen . She walks around counting in Turkish on her fingers , which is how everybody knows she 's beginning to calibrate her body for the necessary cal-culations . " Like a pregnant eunuch . " Father contributed his own simile . She took Michael to the kitchen , picked up a wooden spoon , and gave him a taste of the water the almonds were soaking in . Pressing them between finger and thumb , she slipped their brown skins off and set them to dry on her special soft white masapan towel , laundered only in rainwater and hung to dry in the shade . Then she ground them in a mortar , with soft , circular strokes of the pestle , stopping now and then to stir the grains and  | feel them with the wisdom of her old fingers , for masapan is n't just a flavor , but also a texture , and the way it feels when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less important than the way it tastes . Not needing scales , she poured a precise quantity of sugar into the pot , added a little almond water , and put it on the stove . Then she took the boy 's hand , and together they left the kitchen to contemplate the dissolving of the sugar , returning to the pot right on time . As if an hourglass were releasing sand into the hollows of her body , Duduch could return to the melting sugar just before the genuine punto . Then she inserted a wooden pick into the pot , raised it to her eyes , and examined the web of congealed silver left by the falling drop . I remember how she would close her good eye and wait an immeasurable beat , like the time between pressing on a piano key and hearing the sound dissolve , and when she opened the eye again , she stared at the face of the child , who learned the nature of the moment from the dripping of the sugar into his hand and from the gaze of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Punto da masapan ! " and Duduch added the ground almonds and turned off the fire . Abasho ! " cried the child , " Down ! " and Duduch banged the pot on the floor , knelt , mixed and mixed and mixed , and put the masapan on the marble to cool . A few hours later , when the almond dough had cooled and set , they shaped little hills together , and Michael was allowed to stick the sharp pale nipple of a peeled almond in the summit of each of them . we were seven years old when Tia Duduch came . She was blind in one eye , and had been widowed , raped , and maimed ; one of her children was dead , and she was so stunned by her catastrophe that she did n't speak at all . In her arms was Simon , her surviving baby , a crippled , crooked remnant of her family , and she carried him so that his body would conceal the awful mutilation that had befallen her . She left  | behind the destroyed dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who never stopped groaning " Simms Abrabanel , " and two fresh graves  --  of her husband Elijah , and of her firstborn son Rckhor Ezekiel . When we left Jerusalem , Mother had entrusted the dairy to Duduch , who found herself surrounded by a host of bowls , goatskins , mandilas , and mysterious tins she did n't know what to do with . Every one of them reminded her of her beloved sister-in-law . She was still sobbing bitterly when a young woman appeared in the courtyard , her splendid face framed by the wimple of a Pravoslav nun ; she came to Duduch as if she had known her all her life and beckoned to her to follow . My uncle Elijah was insanely jealous , as I 've said , and jealousy , the lowbrow sister of collecting and love , also infects its victim . Not until the nun rolled up her long habit and proved she was n't a suitor in disguise did Duduch go with her to the Church of Mary Magdalene , where another nun awaited her , an old woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims walking against the wind ; she gave Duduch precise instructions for the preparation of all kinds of yogurt and cheese , which made the dairy she had inherited famous . Duduch was a great success in her new business . Bulisa Levy announced , " When I see white ravens , the chapachula will get the dairy back . " But fate decreed otherwise . Duduch 's world fell down around her , and she came to us . It was the same day Yehiel sent me outside to get some air , and I joined the children on their way to the field to look for antiquities . Brinker was doing his fall plowing , and the blades , as they did every year , turned up reddish and yellowish pottery remnants , glass fragments that gleamed green and blue , marble shards , and colorful floor stones . A mixed group of crows and children walked behind the plow . The crows hunted for earthworms , snails , and seeds , and we scouted for mosaic tiles , the best thing for playing jacks , and for coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general store . Mother called him Cocosin because of the stinking coconut oil he sold . He was mad about the greenish coins the plow turned up , and we were just as mad about candy . In the evening Cocosin would receive us in his house . His wife and his plump daughter also waited at the table , along with our payment for the merchandise : Cadbury chocolate from England . He haggled with us for a long time over how much the ancient coins were worth , since we had no idea of their real value . " You got holes in your teeth from candy , and the Cocosin go to Tel-Aviv to build himself big house with the  | Bar-Kokhba 's pennies , " as Mother slimmed things up a dozen scars later , when the manager of the general store had disappeared wit limit a trace , A silken dusk fell on the fields . The stillness was so soft and deep that Brinker 's giddyaps and the mule 's braying were swallowed up in its folds . The sun and the earth came together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we hovered in the rosy space in between . I heard the cries of the swallows above us , the beating wings of the cattle egrets as they soared over the cows and landed like blurry handkerchiefs on the willows in the riverbed , where they assembled every evening to spend the night together . A small , dark figure appeared walking down from the hills beyond the plowed land not far from Skull Rock . I , of course , could n't see anything , but something in her movement attracted the chil-dren 's attention . They fell silent and fixed their gaze on her . I pressed two fingers to the corners of my eyes to improve my vision a little , but she disappeared in the riverbed , in the shadow of the willows , where the egrets sat like snowflakes in the foliage . A few minutes later the tiny black nebula reemerged at a bend in the riverbed , exhausted and stumbling on the smooth pebbles , climbing and laboriously extricating herself from the thickets on the steep bank . I remember that picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeglasses , gave them to me , and asked me to tell him what was happening . The figure came closer and turned into a short woman wearing a black dress , holding a dark , simian-looking baby in her arms . She passed us , crossed the field slowly , stopped at the edge of the village , right where a Sonol gas station with a Chinese restaurant now stands , looked around until she made out the chimney of the bakery , and headed straight for it . " She 's going to your place , " the children shouted , and we ran after her . To this day , when I look at my old aunt , it seems to me she 's still walking like that , wounded , weak , a suckling infant in her arms clinging to her one breast , with a noisy flock of curious children at her heels . " What 's she doing ? " Jacob asked impatiently . We were hanging on the fence , only our heads sticking out . The minute the woman opened the gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no more than ten steps and collapsed like a top in its last fluttering . " She fell down , " I told Jacob . The door of our house opened immediately , and Mother appeared on the threshold . " Mother 's going to her , " I reported .  | Mother leaped over the four steps , rushed to the guest , and stood over her , " She 's lifting up the baby and giving it to Mother , " I went on . Now that they were relieved of their burden and responsibility , the woman 's hands dropped to her neck , and to my amazement , I saw her rip open her dress . From the corner where I stood I could n't see the exposed chest , only the two big black buttons that came off and rolled from her collar to the sand , only the chalky whiteness of Mother 's eyes wide with terror and her fingers turning pale on the baby 's back . The shattered weeping of the woman in the dust rose in the air . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Jacob . " Just say what you see , not what you think , " he answered sharply . " What did they do to the Duduch ? " Mother shrieked in a strange voice , kneeling down next to the woman , weeping along with her , hugging her . " What 's going on ? " Jacob inquired . " Mother is throwing that woman out of the courtyard , " I said cold-bloodedly . But this time I did n't fool him . Jacob glared at me , forced me to the ground , and took the eyeglasses away from me with unexpected strength . For a few moments , I lay there , and then I got up and went home . Many years have passed since then , and Tia Duduch has n't left us for even one day . She has nursed dozens of infants , made thousands of pieces of masapan , cooked tons of ratatouille , concocted barrels of jams , baked acres of pastries , and did n't say a word . Only one sentence kept emerging from her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ibrahim , what are you doing ? " She announced these words to the family , whispered them to the kitchen utensils , shouted them out the window to amazed people passing by the house , and murmured them into the pillows she would throw out every week , asking for new ones because her nightmares melted deep holes in them that only she could see . But that day in the field we did n't yet know all that had happened . That day we only learned who the woman was . Duduch Nathan , Father 's sister , Uncle Elijah 's widow , a reflection who broke out of Mother 's yearnings and Father 's stories and came to us.  | The splendid Ford , the little girl , the woman , and the man were already forgotten when a green truck came laboring up the hill . Jamila and Mother were gathering flowers on its slopes because camomile did n't work and Jamila suggested other solutions : narcissus to strengthen weak love , mandrake to kindle flagging lust , crab apple petals to assuage desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way , Jamila herself was loved very much . Her husband , a shepherd who could read the ground like a book , had seen the tracks of her bare feet on the lane one day . The prints of her toes and the pads of her heels were so perfect , and the spaces of her arches were so noble and attractive that the fellow abandoned his lambs and followed the tracks until he came to the feet that had made them , and dropped down on the ground they had trod . A few months later negotiations for the dowry were completed , and Jamila came to her husband 's house near our village . With the rest of his money he bought her shoes so she would n't leave tracks anymore , and in exchange he did n't take any other wives but her . The truck stopped . Panting workers in caps and undershirts unloaded building materials , molds to mix cement , black rubber pails , and tools . In the following days they measured , thrust pegs into the ground , stretched strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , uprooting the asphodels that gave it its name , leveling the summit , and mottling its flush with heaps of plaster , gravel , and stones . To me they looked as if they were setting the stage for a play . " Take the Simon too , " shouted Mother when she saw Jacob and me leaving the yard and heading toward the hill . " Then I 'll stay here , " I grumbled . Jacob said that " Simon is family " and we had to take care of him , but I said that I had neither the strength nor the desire to carry him . Even  | though he was short , Simon was very broad-shouldered , and his torments compressed his flesh , making him dense and heavy as lead . Mother sewed him a hammock from an empty flour sack , and when she saw that his weeping was ; about to burst the barrier of his teeth , she 'd shout to us , " Kock the Simon ! " Simon never bothered anyone with his agony , but would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his jaws until it cracked . Mother , who fostered the legend of the wooden wedge Dyedushk , a Mikhail bit during his circumcision , said that biting calms pain . Rut whenever his pain relented , Simon got upset , as if he had lost both the reason and the proof of his existence . As if he wanted to show that it was n't only an alleviation but also a dialogue with the world , he started testing his new teeth on all possible material He left strips of bark turning white on the trunk of the mulberry tree ; he poked round holes in the soles of work boots ; and one morning he crawled to the bakery and shortened the baker 's shovels . Mother was sure that rats ' teeth had had a hand in it , but Yehiel said there was only one animal t hat could gnaw wooden poles like that and it could n't be any of the animals of this country . Simon 's habit quickly turned into a compulsive desire for perfection and improvement ; it smacked of that infuriating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if challenging it : who would give in first . I le did n't let his mother leave him for a single moment . If she disappeared from his sight , he would bellow dully , with that sorrowful grumble of old lawyers when you take their bookmark out of a place . Slow and steady , he dragged along behind her through the yard and the street , leaning on his knuckles and one knee , spitting crumbs of leather and sawdust , dragging his crippled leg after him . When he was two and a half , he still could n't stand upright and walk , but his torso developed the muscles of a wrestler , and the plump pads every baby has on his palms became horned hooves on him . Jacob made him rough crutches and taught him to stand and walk , and Simon conceived a devotion , love , and loyalty for him that continue to this day . " lie had a strange nightmare . He complained of seeing black spots penetrating his body , " I told Father 's doctor about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interesting , " said the doctor . " He cried a lot when he was small ? " " Almost never , " said Jacob , who had come along on that visit at my request and had been silent up to that moment . " Tolerance for pain is different in each person , " said the doctor in the pedagogical tone assumed by kindergarten teachers , preachers , insurance  | agents , and everybody else who comes into contact with dependent people , " Pain , after all , is a processing of the sensation and not the sensation itself , and the processing is first of all a matter of personality , circumstances , and values . Some people yell when you stick them wit 11 a pill , and others do n't make a sound even when they 're broken on the wheel . There ; Ire women who shriek in childbirth , and there are women who only groan . " " I knew a woman who screamed even during fertilization , " I told bins , but the doctor scowled at me and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , " he continued , " there are several errors . Pain does n't always have a purpose , it is n't always at the right intensity , and it can never be measured . You have probably noticed that in reply to the question I low much do you love me ? ' men spread out their arms and women press than together . I ask the patient to rate his pains on a scale of one to ten , and you 'd be amazed what a good indication that gives me of the success of the treatment . Or I ask him to compare a pain he had in the past , an especially strong pain , to his present suffering . " Suddenly he turned to Jacob , pointed to his hand , and said , " For instance , if you were my patient , I 'd ask you to compare your present pain to the cutting off of that finger . " My brother 's face contorted and turned pale . He does n't want people to notice his defect . He feels that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fist clenched so tight his face takes on a violent expression . Now he hurried to cover the lopped-off finger with his other hand . " It did n't hurt when it happened , " he growled . " It probably started hurting afterward ? " inquired the doctor . " I do n't remember anymore , " said Jacob reluctantly . " It was a long time ago .  | We were far away from God and man , up to our knees in dough and earth , and the house under construction became a focus of espionage and outings . On Saturday farmers ' families climbed Asphodel Hill , the children played in the piles of gravel and sand , and the adults went inside , wandered around the gaping spaces , and made esti-mates  --  how much money , how much time , how many cubic meters , how thinly people , who would live where . Every new event or visit from a stranger became a topic of conversation , guesswork , and a very definite kind of hope . The itinerant doctor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers . Sometimes haberdashery peddlers also came . A pleasant smell emanated from their boxes , and the abundance of small items they contained won your heart . But when one of them knocked on the door , Mother would chase him away and watch him suspiciously because they reminded her of the Nawarites of Jerusalem . One day a strange peddler appeared . A tall , skinny man with lusty moist eyes and hair so thin and stringy it could have been the raveled edges of his black skullcap . In the wooden box hanging around his neck was the usual display of razor blades , soap , shoelaces , combs , and a dozen vials of perfume , " essences " he blended with alcohol to order . Jacob and I peeked into the haberdashery box , and Mother , to our surprise , offered the peddler a glass of water from the icebox and picked out ridoma de colonia as a gift for Father . Then her real intention was revealed . She took a tube of blue eye shadow , put it in her pocket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father woke up from his daily nap , came in , and also started touching and sniffing the vials of essences . Mother was embar-  | rasscd , pushed him aside , and said , " ' There 's no tootles ? for the shoes for children , Abraham , ; 111 ( 1 von huv cologne ? " The peddler shot her a look of hatred , licked his lips instinctively , and uttered one clear word : " Goyete . " No one in our family knew Yiddish , but Mother knew that word very well . It was n't the first time she had heard or thought it . Jacob looked at me and I looked at him , and I think we even exchanged a small smile and retreated to make way for the fight that was about to break out . Mother trembled " like a Bukharan cobbler spit on by a snake . " ' The insulting syllables burst through the bones of her temples and penetrated to her brain , where they exploded . A terrible flush of anger was kindled in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bared her wolf 's teeth , and the veins of wrath swelled on her neck , descending from her jawline and disappearing under her collar . She thrust out two strong , precise hands , grabbed the leather straps of the haberdashery box , and tightened them around the peddler 's neck . The man 's face turned purple , his arms and legs jerked , and his mouth gaped open . Not until his whole body was writhing on the floor did Mother let go of his throat , and only then did a few broken curses manage to creep out . She put a broad , bare foot on his frightened stomach and said : " Who you call goya ? " " Nobody , " groaned the peddler . " You watch out yourself , I 'm the Tartar ! " declared Mother . We all hid behind her back . Jacob rocked slowly from one foot to the other , waiting for the next round . I wondered if the curses creeping out of the peddler 's mouth were uttered at that moment or had been stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half hidden by her body , Father tapped her shoulder warily , soothing and entreating . Duduch looked at her from the side with a mute and admiring eye , a rare smile of pleasure beamed on Simon 's face , and the goose strutted around making sure no one disturbed his mistress . " My father , a rabbin with beard down to here converted him ! " Mother announced . To the peddler , to us , to the whole world . She shifted all her weight to the foot treading on him , and gestured to indicate the size of that beard . " A bigger beard than the berdaleh on your rabbin , " she went on heatedly . " And eyes he had like the Elijah the Prophet . And my father was grown up when they made him a circumcision . Everybody else they tied with ropes because there was n't no anesthesia , and my father wanted it without no ropes , and he did n't holler because the circumcision was n't no pain for him . "  | " Enough , enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother took her foot off the peddler , bent down to grab his shirt , and pulled hint back onto his quaking legs . " We 're butter Jews than you , " she concluded : " and the blond of Our Father the Abraham is flowing already in my Sons . " Wit h t hat she pushed him back out into the dust and closed the door . Now her knees buckled , and her eyes  --  tired , despairing  --  slowly closed . The wall she hurried to lean on shook with her weight and her weeping . Jacob made her a cup of tea , and Mother sipped it until she calmed down and ut tered her refrain ? " Ah ... that 's good . . . " ? so we 'd know she was better . The next day a short woman with the face of a prematurely aged goat , hands like a bird , and a small wooden valise came to us and asked , " Where 's the lady of the house ? " Without waiting for an answer , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swept the hair off her temples . " It 's much prettier like that . " She took a step back , the better to observe her handiwork . " Chez nous a Paris that 's the latest thing . " In a flash she pulled a blue velvet ribbon out of her pocket and fastened it around Mother 's neck with a white mother-of-pearl pin . Mother laughed a loud , self-conscious laugh , but her eyes closed with pleasure . The whole picture was strange and wonderful , and even then I knew I would never forget it : Mother , a head and a half taller than the strange woman , beautifully transformed by the cheap trinkets . Jacob and I gazed at her in admiration . Suddenly , in our eyes , she looked like a different woman ; her big face , wide-set gray eyes , and broad shoulders lost their coarseness and became so splendid they frightened us with their foreign new force . With a delicate shove the guest sat Mother down in a chair . " S'il vows plait , Madame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the formidable face and hair and shoulders like yours , you could have been the very very most beautiful queen . " She opened the valise , took out a comb , scissors , a black hairnet , a hand mirror , and bobby pins , and said , " Yesterday there was somebody here who behaved very not nice , and I came to ask ... As she was speaking , Simon 's incisors closed on her foot . Fortunately for her , the teeth sank into her shoe and not her skin . There was an awkward silence , but then the woman leaned down , stuck her hand under his shirt , and stroked his back with her fingertips . A miracle occurred . Simon 's eyes closed , his muscles relaxed , his jawbone let go of its prey . " Men and boys , " laughed the woman , " they 're all the same , lovely little clogs . Chez nous a Paris they bite when they 're forty , too . " And she ordered  | Mother to sit still in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started cutting and combing her hair . That was how Mother met Chenou Apari , the wife of the obnoxious peddler . She was a devout Frntcophile , an expert in affairs of the heart , and Mother 's good friend from then on . She had a little hc , rnity parlor in the next village and a small and adoring circle of customers who considered her the last word in curls , permanents , and love . She was indeed a gifted hairdresser and succeeded in making those hardworking women beautiful . All of them were worn down by monotonous years of poverty and toil , and had no one to make themselves beautiful for except their oafish husbands . The nickname Chenou Apari stuck to her because she was always saying those French words which mean " back in our Paris . " Of course she also had a real name , but it had vanished through disuse and no one knew what it was anymore . She herself had lovingly adopted her nickname and would introduce herself proudly , " Chenou Apari , enchantee . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression " chez nous a Paris " : " Chez nous a Paris love is like the bread of the people . " " Chez nous a Paris people kiss in the street . " " Chez nous a Paris even the very very most dirty clochard knows how to pamper a woman . Once a month Mother went to her for her beauty needs , and once a week for her social and emotional needs . Here she sat with her new women friends , exchanging recipes and complaints , leafing through magazines full of gorgeous women accompanied by handsome , visionary poets , involved in aviation and banking , who wrapped their throats in silk cravats . Chenou Apari ruled over these convocations of women with a hand both firm and gentle , and was as generous with her own secrets as with those of other women . " Here comes Rosa , " she would declare . " Well , Rosa , we all want to know what happened last night . Did the ointment help your husband ? " To give her her due , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , so the sessions in the beauty parlor turned into workshops of confession and absolution that the women were passionately devoted to . They believed in her so much that even her prematurely lined face did n't keep them from buying the wrinkle creams she concocted to rejuvenate their skin . " It does n't do a thing for me , " she once told a woman who was hesitating and examining her dubiously , " but you do n't have to suffer because of that , right , ma cherie ? "  | A few faded postcards from school : in fifth grade we had a substitute teacher whose left hand was always stuck in his belt . In science class I threw up once because the smell of formaldehyde reminded me it Brnkcr 's Dead Livy . In contests of general knowledge  --  synonyms , rivers , hooks , capital cities , or who said what to whom  --  I always won first prize . Nut school memories are n't the kind that want to resurface in me , and none of my teachers left a mark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I volunteered to deliver the bread . Every day I got tip at six in the morning , loaded the cases of bread into the cart with Lit her , harnessed the donkey , and left the yard on my adventures , heir of Hector and Ben-Hur . The red dust road was still damp with dew , and the Nutt , worn rubber tires did n't even make a murmur . Achilles and Messala were nowhere on the horizon , and since the donkey knew the way and the houses where he had to stop , I put the reins around my neck and buried my nose in a book . I managed to read three or four more books a week that wary . I would linger at Isaac Brinker 's for a few minutes despite the depressmg presence of Dead Livy . Brinker would just have come in from milking , and the two of them would have finished their morning quarrel , which always revolved around the same subject : food . Brinker loved omelets with parsley , but the smell of parsley gave Dead Livy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , Dead Livy would make cockscomb soup , which nauseated her husband to the depths of his body and soul . Brinker knew why I was hanging around and would take the piece of amber he had brought from Germany out of the drawer . Inside the amber a million-year-old fly was embalmed , as fresh and surprised as the moment He died . I would put it up to my eyes and take a deep breath . In the book on old Uli-Buli there was a block of amber like that , and there too the children held their breath at the sight of it . The light was refracted in the  | gilded arches ; Ind magnified the image of the fly , and the faculty of the nearsighted to see clearly at short range made it very sharp . " How is your mother ? " Brinker asked , stroking my neck . " Fine , " I said . " Give her my regards , " he said . " Tell her to come take the chicken droppings for her garden if she wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies with him turned into private lessons based on a deal of " English for bread . " I liked the English language . I know now that I found in it the qualities I would someday discover in the women I loved  --  clear intelligence , the humor of the victors , as well as the gracious generosity that greatness and diversity bestow on their possessors . To this day I am impressed by the plethora of its synonyms , its waiver of gender , and its strictness of tense . Ten years after those lessons from Yehiel I talked with his old uncle about the love of English . Edward Abramson sneered contemptuously : " Yes , yes , that 's a language for Franklin and Hardy , not for Ecclesiastes and the Ten Commandments . Three hundred words for all kinds of sheep and pliers , and only five words to die with precision . " I loved those lessons , which also included coffee and cookies and the conversation and affection of a grown-up man . And thus , as my classmates endeavored to declaim , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to China to get a lamp , " with Yehiel 's guidance I could already read Fenimore Cooper in his own language , the fondly remembered Pudd'nhead Wilson , and later on Tracy 's Tiger , my favorite love story of all , as I have taken pains to hint . Thus , Yehiel also made his contribution to my withdrawal , my consolidation , and ultimately  --  my trip . Bachelorhood suited Yehiel well . Ile wore tweed jackets , the only jeans in the country , and yellow American work boots . Every now and then he 'd buy cheese and vegetables from the farmers and eggs from Jamila , who also learned a few words from him . When Yehiel asked her , " How do you do ? " she would laugh with her big teeth , tinkle her jewels , and repeat after him , " Hadidu , hadidu . " In time he opened up to me , and one day , he revealed his secret dream : to formulate his own last words now . " I 'm nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told me sadly . His dream was to formulate a last utterance so important and beautiful it would be worthy of inclusion in a distinguished anthology , along with those of the prominent dead . He made up last sentences , tested them on me , and recited them incessantly to observe how they rolled between the palate and  | the tongue so he would n't forget them in the mists of dying . He quickly despaired because none equaled the marvelous sentences of his collections . Ile enviously quoted Beethoven 's last words : " In heaven I will hear . " He melted at Gocthe 's death rattle : " more light .... " " What simplicity , " he cried , " what humble optimism iii such great human beings . " Only when he had almost given up hope did an idea flash in his mind That was so brilliant it made him impatient and his death suddenly seemed too remote to be realized . He decided to laugh between his final words , whatever they would he . He would laugh softly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of death . At dusk I would go with him to watch the laborers working on Asphodel Hill . Even before the construction was finished , you could sense that the house emanated intelligence and wealth . From the room on the roof Yehiel concluded that the owner was a poet . Dead Livy announced that a poet did n't need two bathrooms and decreed that a rich Englishman was building the house for his Jewish mistress and his illegitimate son . In the general store Cocosin said he had already met the inhabitants , a family of Jewish industrialists from Dresden who had rented the entire Pension Saltzman in Haifa until the house was finished , and were going to set up a porcelain factory in the village . But I , who had already seen the little girl who was to live here , knew she was n't a son , legitimate or illegitimate , and that she did n't look like the daughter of poets or of porcelain makers , but I did n't correct anyone . Meanwhile carpenters came and installed thick doors of wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered and whitewashed , t des were set . Two gardeners planted shade trees and fruit trees , flowers and grass , and the green truck brought crates and furniture . Workers unloaded the shipment , and I , who had been given my own eyeglasses by t hen and broke then the next day and Father honored me with a slap in the face , pressed my fingers to the corners of my eyes and went out to see t l le show . They carefully carried wrapped pictures , goblets padded with wool , metal trunks , and wooden crates . The tables were heavy and polished . The armchairs were cumbersome and plump , and when they were hurled in the air , they looked like heavy dowagers caught in flagrante delicto , swollen ankles kicking and panties waving . The next evening the Ford returned . The tall man , the leaning woman , and the flowery girl entered their new house , and all night long lights shone and wonderful merry music poured from the open windows . A few years later , as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I  | stepped off the ship in the port of New Orleans and wrist to look for a meal and eyeglasses . I was n't surprised . Even then I knew that Emerson was right , that old smells , sounds , and pictures lie iii ambush for you no matter where you go . Strangers sometimes show up at our house and ask for " Mr. Abraham Levy . " " We got a letter , " they say . " We got a letter and we came . " Father takes them to his room for a short talk , and a few minutes later they go off , downcast and ashamed . " They failed the test , " Jacob laughed when I asked him about it . For years , my brother explained , our father has been sending letters to people he suspects of being relatives . " He 's building himself a new family , better than the one he 's got . That 's why all the telephone books are in his room . He wo n't rest until he writes to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America , and one son is estranged from his father . A human being has to have a family , " Father replied to my questions . " Can you live with relatives like that ? " He pointed to Simon . " Look at that . Where 's all the intelligence of his father of blessed memory ? Elijah , who had the wisdom of King Solomon , Elijah , who observed all stars and read all numbers and spoke all languages ? Gone , all gone . The gloss is gone , the dross stays on . " I look at Simon and see tempered flesh and forged pain . Hephaestus bent over the anvil of his own body . " That 's not the child of Elijah of blessed memory . " Father continued his laments . " That one , when he was little they gave him to a Georgian wet nurse , and her milk made him stupid . " And to prove the wisdom of Elijah , he quoted a poem his beloved brother-in-law wrote at the age of six . And the stork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her path far above Cuts the sea of blue . " Let hint tool around with those poems all he wants , " Jacob fumed . " Old godd-for-nothing . I rely on Simon , and on myself , and that 's all . " Father even looked askance at Simon 's mother , his sister Duduch . I do n't know if he was still angry about her friendship with Mother , or if he blamed her for her husband 's death , or if he was just one of those men who ca n't forgive a woman for being raped . He always scolded her a lot but nevertheless kept asking her to make him the unforgettable salad of their childhood , tomato juice , slices of green onion , and olive oil , which the omiros , the baker 's apprentices , would dip their bread in and eat with black olives and shots of fig arak . In those days Duduch was weaning Simon because she was afraid of his emerging teeth . Suckling , even more than love , demands complete trust , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rounding his lips and curling his tongue into a tube , wanting to nestle and suck and being rejected . But my aunt 's breast did n't stop producing milk . ( : loaning with pressure and yearning , she began looking for a new baby to noise . She followed pregnant women around , peered into houses where infants were heard crying , climbed fences into yards where diapers were hanging on clotheslines . And once Father was even summoned to the hospital in the next town because his sister had snuck into the nursery with the newborn infants and was n't caught until she had suckled four of them . Ashamed and angry , he brought her back . " Kipazelik ! " he screamed . " What more disgrace will you bring on us ? " She suffered such painful congestion that Isaac Brinker suggested consulting his brother , Herr Professor Ludwig Ephraim Brinker , the famous gynecologist from Jerusalem . Every summer the professor came to the village . A all man with a high brow , whose name and title were whispered by everyone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him Fritzi , wrestled with him in the yard , and rubbed his face in the dust , laughing as yekke peasants do when they throw their professor brothers to the ground . Along with Professor Ludwig Ephraim Brinker came his twin sons . They often visited the bakery , with their smooth tow-colored wavy hair , t heir ironed khaki shorts , their white teeth , and their perforated shoes . Brinker told his brother about my mental powers , and he examined me with the pedantic quizzes of the Heidelberg medical school . " I 'm a flower and inside me is a bird ! " he cried out . " Who am I ? " " Hibiscus , " I said , and won a precise tap on the forehead .  | " I 'm a bird and inside me is a queen . Who am " Gannet , " I answered , and receivcd a gilt : a gigantic steel syringe . I could tell him where the copper mines of Sweden weir , when I Lilies s Comet had appeared over Jerusalem , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire before the eyes of the Etruscan commander . " ' And in the dark of night , without bow or javelin ... ' " said the professor , and when I recited the following lines of Tshernikhovski 's ballad about King Saul , he gave me a pat on the shoulder and an old stethoscope . Yehiel plied him with questions about Tshernikhovski , for Professor Brinker and the poet had studied medicine together . " Yes , of course , " I heard him chuckle , " very much , like stockings . " Yehiel wanted to know who " Miriam " was and what sin the poet had committed against her , but Professor Brinker did n't know . " If he published a poem about her and dedicated it to her , " he said , " apparently that 's really a great secret . " Such was his diagnosis , which stunned Yehiel because disguising reality that way never occurred to him . Professor Brinker was also an enthusiastic phrenologist , an expert on the writings of Lombroso and Kretschmer , and like  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to measure Mother 's skull with a measuring tape and calipers he took out of a special leather pouch . A fine head , " he said admiringly . " The skull fits the brain like a glove . " He explained to her the difference between long faces and round faces : " Saint Francis of Assisi as opposed to Martin Luther , Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , King David and Nabal the Carmelite , Dante and Goethe . " Mother , who did n't know these personages and was not well versed in the ways of the academic world or in German nicknames , called him " Professor Fritzi " with an embarrassed little curtsy of respect . Dead Livy snorted as corpses do just before they roll into their graves , Father blanched with shame , and Professor Ludwig Ephraim Brinker blushed with pleasure . In exchange for letting him measure her head , she asked him to relieve Duduch 's pains . But by then the poor woman was so strongly identified with her late husband 's jealousy that she would n't let him examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the milk , but they did n't work ; and when he returned to Jerusalem , he sent her an awkward rubber and glass pump that did n't squeeze a single drop from her nipple . She would walk around the house , stooped and groaning , and even now I have trouble believing what happened one day . Out of a bewildering sisterhood that eludes the understanding of men , Mother closed herself up  | with Duduch in a room and tried to stick from her , but to no avail . Duduch required the tongue and gums of a baby . At the family table she would suddenly bare her breast with a strange and touching gesture , for there was both generosity and supplication in her . Swollen , lonely , and ashamed , terrifying in its orphanhood and splendor , my aunt 's left breast bursts into my memory and lights up the room with its beauty , its freshness , and its nostalgia for its amputated twin . Time Rude my father into an old man . My brother into a grown man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me ? What did it do to me ? Only my aunt 's breast remains as it was , preserved in the amber of its youth . " Like a photograph f the second breast , " as Romi said . " Good God ! " Father lowered his eyes , and his chin trembled with anger . " What are you doing ? There are big boys here . " Jacob and I , who were past bar-mitzvah age by then and starting to %point signs of a mustache , looked at the silken mound with round eyes and dry palates . Jacob could n't resist , stuck out a hand , and touched it with his fingertips . Father hit his arm and shouted at her , " Get away from here ! Whore ! Putana ! " " Leave the Duduch alone , evil you ! " Mother rose up beside Duduch 's chair . " You did n't understand nothing ? She does n't want man , she wants babv I ter big hand fluttered over the hair that had lost its Saroyanesque blue luster , traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched for a moment over the empty eye , then caressed the neck , descended to the bud of the nipple , which looked as if it had been painted on with a purple mush , and covered her sister-in-law 's nakedness with a panel of her dress . ' l is Duduch shivered , leaned her head on Mother 's hip , and a dark wet spot spread on the fabric of her dress . " Ibrahim , what are you doing ? " she sighed . Father shuddered with wrath and left the room , and Jacob said , " Now he 'll go yell into the oven for sure . " But Father returned with the shakikra de rani wound around his forehead to show that he had dolor de kabesa , t hat they got on his nerves , that they should all get out of his sight now , t hat they should leave him alone . Duduch was n't the only one who disgraced him . None of us managed to satisfy him . He hated Mother for her behavior , her origins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son " ; I was easy-going and polite , but I had already withdrawn into my own blurry worlds , and Father was the first to understand that salvation would not come to him from me.  | Simon was also an inexhaustible affront to honor . That car he was in fact promoted to the third grade and surprised everyone with Ins diligence , but at the same time he graduated limn biting to a mad passion for sweets . Dead Livy had a separator and a Hoskyarrta baud chore , and sometimes Brinker would smuggle Mother a little butter and create , and she would make us a treat of cocoa , cream , and sugar . Simon , who could hear the whisk beating from any distance and any place , would materialize in the kitchen with his twisted hyena 's gait , and stare at Mother with pleading eyes , salivating eagerly . She would bend down , show him his portion and say , " Do n't bite ! " We would laugh as Simon , pale with yearning , carried his spoils to a hidden corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sally fort h again , and give Mother back the bowl and spoon , which were carefully licked clean . Mother was fond of Simon and pitied him because she understood his distress . Not his pain , but the supressed animality that dwelled in him just as in her . Sometimes she would save up a few pennies and buy a chocolate bar from the English soldiers who came to get bread for the base . Simon would pop the chocolate into his mouth , but despite the tremendous temptation for strong and instant gratification , a temptation both little boys and grown men have a hard time fighting , he did n't chew it or even suck it , he just closed his eyes and his lips and let it melt in the warmth of his mouth . Still as a stone he was then , immersed in his sensations like a fakir , his whole body wrapped around the strip of pleasure between his tongue and his palate . I could see how the sweetness dissolved in his mouth , infiltrated the sorrow of his tissues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chocolate makes the black spots go away , " he once told Jacob . " Give him , give him a lot of chocolada , " said Father . " Let all his teeth rot , the perro , and then let 's see how he bites . "  | One morning when I went out to harness the donkey , I found him already hitched and my brother sitting on the cart . " I 'll come with you to deliver the bread , " he said , and on the way u hosted we stop at the new house . " Forget it , " I told him ; " I really do n't think they eat bread , and anyway they 're not from the village . " " Everybody eats bread , " said Jacob , " even them . " And he turned the aggrieved donkey  --  a diligent and loyal worker but a sworn enemy of change  --  to the new house . In the distance we saw the Ford gliding down the hill . The tall man passed us in a quick cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not until some time later did I understand that I had witnessed a man 's escape from his home and family , and that he would never return to them again . We crossed the field , climbed the hill , and went through the open gate Into the yard . Small piles of building material still mottled the red loam , and plaster dust turned the leaves of the saplings and flowers white . " Bread ! Bread ! " shouted Jacob , ringing the big brass bell to announce our arrival . The house was silent . " Bread ! Bread ! " Jacob went on ringing . The woman peeped out the window . " Come in , boy , bring two loaves . " Her voice was tearful and choked . Jacob selected two loaves and went inside . Two minutes later he returned , his eyes shining . " Why was she crying ? " I asked . " I saw the new girl , " Jacob answered . That night he talked with Father , who laughed and said , " You 're still children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him how to bake  | rolls in the form of birds , and to use raisins and onion skins for owl eyes and hoopoe fringes , The next morning Jacob insisted we go to the new house first . I lc rang the brass bell with great ceremony , and Zivia Levitov , Leah 's mother , called to us to come in . " Come with me , " said Jacob . " And put on the eyeglasses . I want you to see her . " Leah was eating breakfast . She had n't yet plaited her braid , and the abundant cascade of hair stunned me . " This is for you , " said Jacob bravely , approaching the table and putting the birds down in front of her . Leah withdrew into the mantle of her hair and did n't say a thing . " What is it ? " Zivia was amazed . " A gift . " " From who ? " " From me , " said Jacob . " For her . " " And you ? Did you bring something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sad I flinched . " What ? . . . No . No . . . I 'm just his brother . " And then , since I did n't know what else to say and my sentence did n't seem to come to an end on its own , I added , " We 're twins . " " You do n't look like twins , " said Zivia . And to Leah , " Say thank you , Lalka . " Leah glanced at Jacob 's rolls , smiled wanly , and said thank you . " Lalka , Lalka , Lalka , Lalka , " Jacob kept repeating all the way home in the cart . " Lalka , Lalka , Lalka , Lalka . " His jaws moved , Lalkas took wing in his mouth , melting pleasure lit his face .  | That week , as Isaac Brinker was working his vineyard , the blades of his cultivator hit a hard , heavy block hidden under the ground . The startled mule braked as if the hand of fate or of a giant had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exposed a carved marble capital . Greatly excited , he went on digging , and by evening he had discovered a few more broken capitals , stumps of pillars , and some floor tiles . Restlessness gripped him , the uneasiness of a man who has n't yet found what he wants , but does n't even know what it is . At night he continued digging by the light of two oil lamps and a yellow moon , and kept on past , I.iwn , and in the afternoon he exposed a small Hellenistic mosaic and knew I n he had n't stopped digging . Narcissus and poppies bloomed in the mosaic , two faded geese twined their necks at the edges , and in the center ' , . is the dull image of a beautiful woman whose eyes and pale stone nipples t allowed you wherever you went . Brinker knelt down and could n't get cough of the sight . Then he covered the mosaic 's nakedness with soil and ran to the library to tell Yehiel Abramson . Relations between Yehiel and Brinker were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Yehiel , smarter and better educated , and Yehiel suspected him , correctly , of being the man who had hung the announcement mocking his translation of Shakespeare . But Yehiel ruled the library and Brinker could n't live without it , so there was a balance of power . Yehiel and I were sitting in his office during one of those pleasant hours devoted to English , quoting the openings of books and ranking the rivers of Africa according to their annual flood rate . We were drinking coffee with milk and eating American chocolate chip cookies , and Yehiel recited from Emerson ? " Man does not live by bread alone , but also by catchwords " ? and asked me roundabout questions designed to test whether I had picked up the double irony in the sentence .  | Hc wanted to know who the new people were who kid come to live on the hill . " I hope for their sake tins do n't have am thing to do with the Hebrcw Universitv , " he said gravels . Then he showed me famous " last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being unable to decide between two savings of Archimedes to his Roman captor : " Stand back , you 're hiding the sun , " or " Wait until I finish the equation . " I loved his hesitations and knew he would include all the versions in the end , because like all collectors , he was excited more by quantity than by quality . The two versions of Vespasian 's last words were also among his treasures , and both seemed equally authentic because both had an equal measure of military stupidity . The three conjectures concerning Rabelais 's last words nagged him especially , and he examined them aloud . " I am going in search of a great perhaps . " He waved his hand solemnly . " I 'm greasing my boots for the last journey , " he whispered . " Ring down the curtain , the farce is over . " He clutched his throat and sank to the ground . All three sounded fake to me , and the first quite stupid as well , but Yehiel preserved them with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first pair of shoes . Dusty and sweaty , Brinker burst into the library and told us about the mosaic . The dying Rabelais got up from the floor , put on his tweed jacket , hung the box camera on his shoulder , and invited me to come along . I remember Brinker 's expression as he put his finger to his lips to silence us , knelt down among the vines , and dug with his hands in the soil that covered the buried woman . First a shoulder was revealed , then a neck and a cheek , and I was overcome . I sank to the ground on all fours , pain constricting my vital organs and flooding my eye sockets , the expression of a desire I had n't known until then , the desire to see better , which has since returned to me so sharply only four more times , and I 'll tell you about two of them later . Brinker 's broad hand exposed the other shoulder , caressed the neck , slid over the breast , and climbed to the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brinker pursed his lips and blew hard , and her face floated up from oblivion . Pure and comely she was , and her cool beauty illuminated the vineyard . The librarian was excited . He began walking around and around her in a marvelously precise circle , as if bound by a string to her gaze , all the while murmuring in English , " Unbelievable , unbelievable , " for the girl followed him too with her nipples and her eyes . Brinker called my attention to this phenomenon , which roused great wonder in me . Only as time  | passed , with the help of my Venus of ' rhino , ( lid I decipher the secret of that roving gaze . I discovered that for all her charm and sexuality , her reddish hair , her girlish nipples , and her strong hands , she is squinting . Please do n't argue with me , my dear . I do n't think there is another man in the world who has spent more hours than I in front of her picture , except maybe Titian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket with water , and when he poured it on the mosaic , the girl came to life . All at once , the color returned to her skin , the warmth to her flesh , the suppleness to her breasts , and the gleam to her eyes . The yellow of the narcissus glowed , amorous hues blossomed on the gander 's neck , and the two men sighed . Not until years later did my own flesh teach me that that was the sigh of men whose embalmed love had returned and awakened before their eyes . Then Yehiel photographed the mosaic from various angles and advised Brinker to cover it again with soil and not to tell anyone about it . Three days later a truck came loaded with picks , sieves , and excited scholars from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem . Yehiel blazed with the rage of a betrayed librarian and announced that he would n't join them . Brinker led the guests to the red pennant he used to mark the girl 's grave , and they dug but found nothing except fragments of capitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the library and demanded t hat Yehiel hand over the roll of film he had taken . Scornful and insolent , Ychiel did n't even deign to show them out . The angry archaeologists went hack to Brinker and accused him of playing a joke on them ; he was offended and threw them out of his vineyard . The loss of the maiden gave Brinker headaches and the kind of agony " that story tellers call wounded love . " His suspicions muddied the atmosphere in the village and stirred up a sea of conjectures there . Some claimed that Yehiel stole the mosaic to get even with the Hebrew University ; others pointed a finger of blame at Jamila 's husband from the neighboring Arab village , since he had already been caught stealing antiquities ; still others accused Mr. Cocosin of the general store ; and there were those who remembered children playing " jacks " with small stones . Brinker himself suspected his own wife , who was so jealous she did n't even trust women in portraits . But the weeks passed , time sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody forgot the mosaic , but when I went to the library , I would sometimes see Yehiel sitting there looking at some picture he had taken , and I knew I must n't disturb him . " How , of all the men in the village , did you get close to those two who fell in love with Mother ? " Jacob said to me yesterday when we saw Brinker  | in the street . The old man was leaning on the nursers ' school fence , listening to the little ones singing , and did n't recognize me . " I can understand what they saw in you . Thu were a key for them , and it cover , and a pretext . But what did you see iii them ? " That 's what I just do n't get . At night people would come to the bakery . There were field guards , men who sprayed the groves , hungry workers getting off the night shift . But there were also those I privately called " the condemned " : the smell of bread reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to us . One by one they rose up out of the dark and took shape . On especially hot or especially cold nights , when many people came , the bakery looked to me like a remote field clinic for those infected with yearning . Each one and his own flaw , each one and his own grief , each one and his own pain sat in the yard and chewed his bread . We did n't know many of them , nor did we know their names or their homes . Some were great insomniacs whose memories would n't let them fall asleep . Some were in love , and their pain was doubled by Hypnos in his cruel mirror dreams . Some were ugly and emerged from their houses only under the veil of darkness ; some were seeking consolation ; some were lunatics who wanted to burn their wings at the grace of the oven . They ate the bread with tremendous concentration . Those who were experienced and addicted would bring something to spice the bread ? cheese , a pickle , a herring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read . Sometimes they came inside and asked permission to dip their bread in Dyeduskhka Mikhail 's ancient salt cellar , or they peered through the window to watch us at work . Father 's precise and measured movements , the warmth of the oven , the iron laws of fermenting and ris-ing  --  all this calmed their soul . Mother , the practical and excited one , wanted to add another room onto the bakery , put tables and chairs in it , and sell butter and cheese ,  | olives and tea But Father could n't hear the nocturnal guests . Ile claimed that when they came in and went out of the bakery , the door slammed and the dough fell because of the banging . " Thu wo n't make a cafe of Italians here ! " he announced , and told Simon " to throw those good-for-nothings , those indehiniados , out of the yard . " Simon , who knew in his own body the soothing labor of the bread , was confused ; he cast a questioning glance at Jacob and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jacob . Even today he claims that I was even blinder than they thought back then . " Brinker was in love with her , his brother the professor was in love with her , your Yehiel could n't take his ryes off her , and all those poor souls were thinking about her while they chewed their bread . " " You 're talking nonsense , " I told him , surprised at the blunt rage his Ovoids aroused in me . Of course I remembered that Yehiel came too . He was it bachelor , and the nights sometimes assaulted him with stabs of loneliness , stupor , and restlessness . I knew he sometimes went to the city because Dead Livy would greet him the next day at the door of the general store and ask loudly , " Well , Yehiel , an intellectual like you went to do a mitzvah ? " But Yehiel usually came to the bakery to eat fresh bread and look at t he photograph of the stone maiden as he chewed . " I thought you understood those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jacob mocks me . He was always surprised at how many losers Benjamin and I had . But he despises me , and he boasts of his son . " So many girls came to his funeral , " he repeats proudly . Once he saw Leah , he joined me every morning . He started wearing a white shirt to deliver the bread and carried a small comb in his pocket . His hair  --  thick and wavy in those days , soft and thin today  --  made him unhappy . Chenou Apari had given him an old wooden comb , and as soon as we left the yard , he started running it through his stiff curls to make them assume some sort of shape . Sometimes he was steeped in prolonged meditations , and a smile suddenly played over his face as prophecies and supplications of love kept forming inside him . Every morning he drove the Patri-arch 's carriage into the Levitov yard , rang the bell hard , selected a nice loaf of bread for Zivia , took the pasharikos he had baked for Leah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would invite him in . " Lalka , Lalka , Lalka , " I heard him sating himself with that ancient oath of men  --  the name of the beloved . " Look , " he said and pointed to something only he saw . " Those are her footprints in the sand . See how pretty they are . " And he took off his right sandal , put his bare foot in Leah 's print , and closed his eyes . " It 's like  | ouching . " I lc took off the other sandal and walked in her - lacks until they rose onto the grass and vanished . How strong is the love of a boy , hotter and inure desperate is it than all other love . When my brother cane out of the Levitov house , I knew from the way he walked down the steps whether he had seen her or not . I hoped he would n't notice the bread birds he had brought her yesterday scattered among the freesias in the garden . The sun had already dried their flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pecked out their eyes . Jacob did n't linger over them and did n't say a word about them , and today he even claims that such things never existed , but I ca n't forget those dead birds in the flower beds . A dozen years later , when I started writing my first bread book , I invented in it " an ancient Jerusalem custom " of greeting the beloved with such rolls . I called the book The Bread of Jerusalem , and I wrote the whole thing from memory and reconstruction leavened with imagination and fiction ; between bread recipes , I embroidered documentary fabrications and authentic falsehoods that were very popular with readers . Who knows better than you , my dear , that it is easier to invent a fact than to discover it , and I have been an expert in that profession for so many years that I no longer know which of the facts in my books are really true . I either concealed or delayed a few details , as I am doing at this very moment , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary . Do you remember what Miss Prism said to Cecily ? " Memory is the diary that we all carry about with us . " And Cecily answered , " But it usually chronicles the things that have never happened . " I do n't understand how Oscar Wilde could have endowed such a stupid girl with so much perspicacity , but in any event , it is the nature of private diaries to show up at a time that is very inconvenient for their owners  --  after their death  --  and I ca n't trust that Jacob will live long after me and destroy my diary when the time comes . I 'm not Goethe and my brother 's not Max . An American woman whose broad white shoulders I remember well told me on the one and only night she spent with me that a liar has to have an excellent memory . " More excellent than yours , " she said , and then she laughed and got up and left . " A viper in a basket of figs , " she called me . Bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endeavor to recall the reason for it , but if I do say so myself I have an excellent memory . I 've already told you that as a child I always won the school contests , and in the United States too I once gave in to temptation and participated very successfully in a public contest of quotations and general knowledge . But I distinguish between memory and memorization , remembrance and recollection , and whenever I need my archives their content changes . This quality , which I euphemistically call " creative recollecting , " I inherited from my  | father , who was and remains adroit prevaricator without any malice . " " That hook was'nradc by lt . Mark ' Twain , and he told the truth , mainly . There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth , " Iluckleberry Finn testified about his creator . About my own father I can say that if Agathon had known him , he would have changed his famous maxim and said , " Even God ca n't change the past , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't bear b'ather 's fabrications and similes , while I just want to enjoy stories whether they 're true or not . I was struck by nostalgia in my writing , the kind of calloused nostalgia nothing can extirpate from the soul  --  for the home I had left ; for my mother , whose awful curse has stayed with me to this day , more than thirty years after she uttered it ; for my brother ; for the blurry landscape of my youth ; for my brother 's wife , whose love I did n't fight for as I should have ; I even missed the rats in the bakery . Struck with remorse I was , for my trip , for its nature and its reasons . And struck with rage I was , for the young shoots torn off , hanging flaccid from the soles of my feet and giving me phantom pains in the limbs amputated even from my memory . Grief filled me as I wrote . " And an uninvited wave of tears will also come , and choke the throat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised my eyes from the desk and looked at the pictures of my women on the wall . Meanwhile , I had already thrown away the pages I had torn out and stolen from Yehiel 's albums the night before my trip , and with my first paycheck in America I bought myself beautiful reproductions of the Odalisque a la culotte grise and Venus of Urbino . The truth is that I prefer Gauguin 's The King 's Wife and Leda and the Swan , but like a gosling who follows the first creature he sees when he hatches , so I want the woman I saw then , when my virgin eyes hatched . " Your books are loathsome scribblings , " Jacob wrote me . " I do n't have enough time or enough English to finish them . " I was n't offended . My bread book was a great success . Newspaper reviewers wrote about " the erotic mystery of the loaf of bread " and " the fragrant allure of the history of the bakery , " of bread " that accompanies the human race from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death , " and about the author , " scion of a dynasty of Jerusalem bakers " who " kneads before our eyes a wonderful Mediterranean blend of mythology , gastronomy , and history . " In a little while , I 'll tell you about my bread , the " bitter bread of ban-ishment . " In a little while , later , when this pain that gnaws and digs in my chest subsides.  | She 's so beautiful , " Jacob said to me . An ice chip was between his teeth , freezing the h and the 1 as he sucked it ardently . The ice man had passed by in his cart covered with sacks , and Mother had sent us to get a half-block for the icebox in the kitchen . The ice man , who was almost toothless , gave us a terrible smile but let us gather up the slivers his ice pick sprayed from the blocks . All the children loved the ice man , and all the parents warned them against him because of his habit of washing his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were little , Noah Brinker told us that the ice man had murdered his wife and children with this pick and that their blood still stained his skin , and when Noah saw our panic he added that , on the birthdays of the victims , blood dripped from the mur-derer 's fingernails . Unwittingly Jacob had hit on the ancient distinction that beauty , in all its varieties and degrees , is merely " what evokes love . " But we were adolescents then and did n't understand the difference between beauty solely as a physical quality and grace as a physical and spiritual quality . Years later , when I read Giorgio Vasari , I was surprised to see that I had heard all his refinements on that issue from Father in my childhood . He watched Leah , was fond of her , and delighted in calling her " Ijiha con Gracia . " A few years later , when he was urging me to fight Jacob for her , he said , " Grace , stupid . It 's like love and it 's like pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can measure in centimeters . " Leah was also interested in all kinds of collecting . I really do n't understand how all these collectors have gathered in my life  --  Father with his relatives , Duduch with her sucklings , Yehiel with his father 's books . Sometimes I think Romi is just a collector too . She crucifies her victims on atoms of silver and light , and exhibits their portraits in cages of frames , like  | her mother in those far-off days . Leah collected dried flowers , stamps , napkins , dolls , and postcards her father wilt her from all over the world . Unlikc hid Abramson , who hid his collection of famous last words from rangers , she used to invite her girlfriends to show them her collections , d she did it in such a way that none of them felt jealous , not even over C picture of the actor John Gilbert that came from abroad with his signare sparkling at the bottom . The girls said that the collections were arranged in hundreds of small polishcd boxes of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only child in a rich family , aside from a tormented and distant father whose guilt drained a stream of gifts from him . She had her own nn on the roof , with her own clothes closet , containing an abundance of ousts and skirts , and even a few ensembles from the exclusive Ilka bouiqne , with rustling sachets of rosemary and lavender nestled among them . ow , at her bedside , Jacob shows me the faded remnants of the old collecon of butterflies and says in a broken voice , " Remember her then ? member ? " Back in those days he claimed that when she crucified the butterflies with pins , they sighed in gratitude at being found worthy of her attention , and I know what 's going through your mind now . You 're wrong , ms dear . I 'm not a collector . Neither of memories nor of quotations and fait s . Willy-nilly they collect in me . Like Father 's pains , like Jacob 's sufferings , like Romi 's photos , like all those women , harvested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring cleared out , summer came early , the blaze of August prevailed in early May . In the bakery time revolved , not deviating from its cycles . In the library Yehiel showed me a photograph of the Hindenburg Zeppelin blazing on its anchor and read me an article from the New York Times about the Peel Commission so I would also learn " newspaper English , " and when I asked him why he did n't get married , he laughed and quoted two maxims from Robert Louis Stevenson : " Married life is a long , straight , and dusty road to the grave , " and " The cruelest lies are often told in silence . " One I understood even then , and the other one I do n't understand even now . I remember that on May Day that summer we sat in the library gluing bindings . Outside we heard the drums of the parade beating to a song that made Yehiel grimace . On mountain , on vale , From here to Bombay ,  | All cheer cold all hail The first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , On land and on sea His banner 's unfurled . " The kulaks sing about workers , " said Yehiel contemptuously . In the few hours I spent outside the bakery and the library , I saw that the grass in the fields had turned yellow , the level of the brook was low , and the little fish caught in the puddles in the riverbed had died from the heat of the water even before it evaporated . Birds mad with anxiety fought over every dripping faucet , filled their beaks with water , and sprayed it on their nests , beating their wings over them in vain . A stench rose from the nests , where chicks were baked alive and unhatched eggs boiled and rotted . And in the hottest hours you could suddenly see Leah coming out of her house on the hill . A child of the sun she was , and the sun did n't turn her skin red or burn her , but gave her a good smell of fruit and made her the brown color of Florentine bronze . ( Florentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm quoting . ) Her hair shone . When she rode her bike , her dress would cling and billow in turn on her gilded legs , and from the right angle you could see the white flash of her thighs . I could sense Jacob 's muscles tense and his heart quicken , but back then I did n't understand why . He would go up to the roof or climb a tree to observe her , and I would go to the library to bring him " nice sentences for letters . " Yehiel sat at his table pasting stamps on letters to be sent abroad . He had taken to writing to the families of " prominent deceased " to ask them for the last words of their loved ones . Among his addressees in those days were the relatives of Lawrence of Arabia , Kemal Ataturk , the writer Scott Fitzgerald , the painter Paul Weber , and the composers Gustav Sterner and George Gershwin . Incidentally , when Virginia Woolf 's last letter to her husband Leonard was published , Yehiel sent the widower a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include " Mrs. Woolf 's lovely sentence " in his collection : " I do n't think two people could have been happier than we have been . " But Leonard Woolf did n't answer Yehiel 's letter either . In his despair the librarian told me he would have to murder some famous person to hear his last words with his own ears .  | " Albert Einsiein , " he said , " Ire 's the best choice . " I told Yehiel of my brother 's request , and he directed me to Peter Alenberg ; " lino flesh is like a delicate poet 's song . " " Here , you bathe in hl and air , " and other such blandishments that made Jacob so happy he fried to weave them into a letter he sent with Simon . Leah was sitting on the balcony when the crippled boy crossed the low field and lurched into her yard , waving the letter at her . " ( : et out and take that back to whoever sent it , you black monkey , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbed the banister of the Icons ' with both thick , filthy hands , and swung himself up . Leah was so scared by the crushing force of his fingers on her wrist that she took the letfrom him . Simon stood next to her to make sure she read it , and then said , ' And now you 'll write an answer and I 'll take it . " " I 'll just go get pen and paper . Wait here , " said Leah pleasantly . Meanwhile , have a drink of water from the faucet . " She got up , went into the house , and locked the door behind her . threc scars later , lying on her bed , she shifted her cascade of hair from her shoulders , asked me to stroke her neck with my fingertips , and told me t hat Simon had waited on the balcony for ten hours . Not until one o'clock in the morning , when he heard the burner lit in the bakery and smelled the sourish rising of the dough , did he leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my brother 's old childish letters , and the two of us , ss it bout any malice , read them and laughed . " You 're both so pathetic , " she said . " You should n't have tried so hard . All you had to do was kill a lion with your bare hands and bring me his car-cass . " I never experienced those torments . I was steeped in my books , and along with my nearsightedness they defended me like Perseus 's polished shield . I did n't take my first real steps in the love of women until a few years later , at a relatively advanced age , and then with great ease . I was twenty-two the first time I went to bed with a woman . She was a few years older than me , was built like me , and she won my heart with her habit of writing authors ' dedications to herself in her copy of their books . " In the crow 's nest , between the deck and the sky , I sought your bounty. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( " I expected a somewhat more original dedication from him , " she told me plaintively. )  | " My black ' tartar , eat me berry by berry , ? William . " " Remember the blue anemone " - Victor " " My /also , Imo bon bun lion -- Andre . " ( With a line under the third " boo , " of course . ) There were also the usual dedications from Hemingwav and Wassermann , and another one , surprisingly long and direct , from  --  you wo n't believe it  --  Miguel de Cervantes , who kept having detailed erotic visions of her in his prison cell and declared that he wrote the book there only to try to forget her . " The first time you do it in the dark , " she told me . " And take your glasses off by yourself and remember where you put them . " She guided me with her words , routed me with her laughter , and directed me with her sighs until I was inside her , surprised at the simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daydreams . But Jacob , an emotional , humorless , and short young man , with his thick glasses on his nose and his whole body throbbing like a heart plucked out of its ribcage , was too young to see the laughing face of love . In despair and crushed he was , and he plunged into the dark depths of his suffering with all the levity of a block of lead . Father told Mother : " Your son is as heavy as the head of an Albanian , " and threw him out of the bakery because his presence there was enough to kill the yeast . He often climbed to the top of the mulberry tree to see the love of his life skipping in her winged sandals over the fields , brandishing a butterfly net ; and he immediately ran after her , gave her brown beetles that secreted a stinking defensive fluid , scorched by the sting of impatient bees , whose toil and sterility make them hate all lovers , and he gathered the abandoned larvae of swallowtail butterflies that Leah raised in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber block because he knew she longed to add it to her collection , but I refused . " Borrow it from him and tell him it got lost , " he pleaded . " I 'll swipe it , " he warned . " And they 'll blame you , " he threatened . With a persistence and courage only amorous boys can muster , he tried to strike up a conversation or catch a glance . When Leah was prancing around with her girlfriends , he felt their sharp looks pierce his back and heard their laughing , venomous hornets ' buzz . Mother recognized in him all love 's obstacles and clumsiness , which she knew so well from her own life , and when she saw him bare his stomach one day and lie prone on theground , she was terrified .  | " What did you doing ? " she shouted . " I 'm listening to her footsteps . That 's how the Indians do it , " said Jacob ; and when he saw inc laughing , he got up and chased me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all was the knowledge that there was no one anywhere around who could give him advice . I was as young and inexperienced as he was ; Tia Duduch 's education in the area of love was summed up in yearnings for Elijah 's jealousy ; Mother was even more pitiful than he was in her awkward wooing of Father ; and Father regarded the conduct of his wife and son as " una granda palabra . " In his distress Jacob went to Chenou Apari , the expert on " relations . " When Chenou Apari said the word " relations , " she meant an all-purpose term for the whole collection of rules of intimacy , from the precise pitch of first looks and opening lines , to the color code governing the sending of roses , to degrees of whispering and endearment and various kinds of kissing on the way to the " act . " And when Chenou Apari said the word " act , " she always said it with the definite article , the way Mother said proper names , and her voice grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , straighten that hair of yours , " Chenou scolded my brother . " What are you , the king of Africa ? " She sat him down on a chair , smeared an oily green liquid on his hair , and combed it . " Chez nous a Paris , " she went on , " men have smooth , soft hair and the fingers of a pianist . " And she decreed that " in love the very very most important thing is to know where to put a period and where to put a comma . " And start shaving every day , " she said , " or it 's like dirt on your face . You 're not a child anymore . Any minute now you 're a man . " She stood in front of him and took his crimson face between her hands . " Chez nous a Paris men are not animals , " she declared . " They have patience . ' They know it is forbidden to skip any stage on the way to the act . " Chenou 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later in America when I told her the story of her parents ' love  --  would sit at the back of the beauty parlor filing his fingernails , smoking foul-smelling Maluki cigarettes , and sometimes playing oriental tunes on an old clay ocarina . Chenou Apari amused all the women with her juicy descriptions of their bedroom habits . " The very most he loves it with tres-tres Nivea , " she bleated out a big guffaw . Sometimes she laughed softly with the guttural clove 's coo Hungarian women use to signal one another that they intend to reveal a secret : " His little thing , when he was young , it would watch him brush his teeth , and now it watches him brush his shoes . "  | Now and then the husband would bestir himself , make tea and serve it to the waiting women , then sweep up the piles of cuttings He loo was a kind of collector , the most repulsive kind , for he collected the women 's hair on the floor of the beauty parlor , and people said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold them in the Nablus souk to old Arabs who came from Transjordan just for that . Mother could n't stand him . Sometimes she mimicked his way of sticking a cup of tea in her face , saying , " Drink , drink , " and staring at her . But Chenou Apari hinted to anyone who was cool to her husband that behind his shabby exterior was a sensitive lover who was never sated , an expert and connoisseur in all manieres of love and seduction in vogue in Paris , who was n't afraid to try anything , and whose main asset was that he " laughs during the act . " " Chez nous a Paris they laugh a lot during the act , " she commented ; " because-after all , the act is a comical thing , non ? " She never said it explicitly , but you could surmise from her words that she also had a lover . Sometimes she went to Tel Aviv " to buy a corset from Mrs. Goldstein " and to restock her supply of Komol hair dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum Christina Bennet songs , or sniff her fingertips conspicuously to hint at the aromatic events she had experienced . Once she came to us and asked for a little yeast to make her rejuvenating creams . " There 's a store , " Father told her angrily . " Go buy it there . " Chenou Apari gave him a long , contemptuous stare , walked around him and examined him very carefully , and finally said to Mother : " Now I understand exactly what bothers you about him . " She spun around to him . " You have a formidable wife , " she said . " Chez nous a Paris she could have been a queen , and you do n't even understand that , cretin ! " " What chez nous a Paris , which chez noes a Paris ? " shouted Father . " When were you ever in Paris , pustema ? " " Pardon , " Chenou retorted with all her charm , and turned her back on him . " Pardoon macaroon , she pretends like she knows French , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey from Tiberias . " She said alors , bon jour , comme ci , and merci a lot , but Father scored a direct hit on Chenou 's weak point , because all her French was summed up in those words , and even though every year on " Bastille Day " she decorated her beauty parlor with " tricolors , " she had never been in France in her life .  | " It is for me an honor that a young gentleman in love comes to ask me for advice , " she told Jacob after he finished whiting his distress . Then she Interrogated him at length about Leah and said , " She does n't pay attention to you ' That 's a good sign . When she finally does pay attention to you , it will be the very most biggest attention . " " The wisdom it is to give the woman exactly what she wants , " she explained . " And it is even greater wisdom to give her what she wants before the knows what she wants . Only when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ooh . . . I low could I have lived without that before ? " On July 13 that year , Mother told Jacob to go help Chenou Apari " clean the fours and widows of the beauty parlor to honor the holiday of the Paris . " When my brother climbed the ladder to hang banners over the linte1 . Chenou Apari suddenly said , " Come down a minute , Jacob , and ' how me your eyes . " " Red like rouge , " she diagnosed . " A sign of love . You 're not blinking , tight ' ' inure scared that the minute you blink , she 'll pass by and you 'll miss he- , right ? " Jacob nodded in embarrassment , and Chenou Apari kissed his cheek . " Nosy you 're a real man , Jacob , " she said . " You 'll give her the sun as a gift . " To this day I do n't know if she was speaking literally or metaphorically . Jacob , at any rate , took her literally . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last one to come out of here . Suddenly I am gripped by an awful weakness , as if my blood were pouring out of me . Sharp , tiny slivers of 1 ; 1. iss are pressing into my bowels so much I am forced to lean on the wall %s It 11 both hands , and I dribble around the toilet bowl . Once I used to close myself up in here and read . Father 's smell prevailed around me like a proclamation of ownership . His hands drummed on the door . His mouth shouted for me to come out . At night , when the sour  | smell of fermentation rose from the bakery and I knew the dough was beginning to rise and lather could n't leave it anymore , I would come in here and latch the little hook behind me . Sometimes I meditated here . Sometimes I daydreamed . Such a repulsive little room , but it has isolation , and it has a lock , and that is enough to let you engage in the " four occupations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reading or day-dreaming , secret tears or sensual gratification . " The strong fresh smell of first semen spread in the air . A faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it . " Father 's fine copper pitcher with the long spout is still on the windowsill . " Pagel par el hula ez por los Ashknazis " was his mocking answer when we asked him to explain the pitcher . And newspapers are for the head , not the bottom , " he added . Ile was very fastidious and never forgot the common toilet of the Jerusalem yard , and in his batch of " good-ways , " there is also a " good way " to purify smells . He takes a long strip of toilet paper and lights the bottom like a wick . The paper blazes , crumbles to a curl of ash , and the flame , says Father , " burns the bad vapors . " But Jacob shouted that if he continued this practice of his , he would set fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought him a dozen jasmine scents . Father tried it once , and went back to his own ways , claiming that " this thing , excuse me , smells like somebody took a crap in Joshua Edelman 's field . " Jacob laughed when I reminded him of the jasmine fields of our youth . Strange , it 's when he laughs that I can hear a crying creep into his voice . " What would I do without your memory ? " he asked . Loving , candid , credulous , and mocking . We are so different from one another , and so close and connected . " You 're right , " he said to me a few days ago at the cemetery . " We 're not twins anymore . Since the day we got one pair of glasses , we have n't been twins . You read , write , fly off above us , do n't want to know , do n't want to get involved . And me , I 'm just a baker , burned at the oven . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows now who won , who was smarter ? " Restrained and reclusive is my brother Jacob , but when he bursts , all his bitterness pours out . " That they did n't tell me how he was killed , that I had to go investigate and examine and discover it by myself  --  never mind that . But that platitude , that **38;0;TOOLONG ' ? that 's what drives me crazy . " Hand in hand , we stood at the tombstone , and the stump of my brother 's finger burned in my hand . " He fell in the performance of his duty , " he said with bitter contempt . " Like a clerk who slipped on a puddle of tea in the office . He fell in the performance of his duty , too , did n't he ? "  | And theft , lowering his voice , he added , " And he did n't fall in the performance of his dui . I lc fell in the performance of their duty . Because of a few stupid officers who did n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a few hysterical soldiers who first shot him and then could n't find hits unt it he did n't have any blood left . So now they tell me it does n't mutter , that everyone who 's killed is a fallen soldier . It does n't matter it it 's in battle or in training or in an accident . I do n't need them and their ceremonies ! I 'm not in their business and I do n't plan to play their games . I clout want their memorials , and I wo n't let anybody tell me what to do ! " Thu know how many memorial days a family like this one has in a rear ' The national Memorial Day , the brigade memorial day , the unit memorial clay , and the command and the school and the village memorial days , so we wo n't get bored for a single minute . And my own memorial day s , what about them ? The day he was born , and the day he died , and the day I saw him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you pass by a tree he fell out of when he was six ? And the memorial minute of silence when you see somebody in the street who was in his class al school , and the memorial second because of some blond kid who looks like hint ? And the places ? How trite and terrible that is . It 's not only the grave , it 's the village monument and the brigade monument and the command memorial and the monument here and the monument there and the memorial plaque in the school . And on top of that there 's the place where he was killed  --  and in this country that 's never far enough away from home  --  and there 's his place at the table , and whenever you set the table , you think about whether to put out his plate too . And when they ask you in some government office how many children you have ? What do you answer ? Two or three ? " " Stop it , Jacob , you 're exaggerating , " I told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old smoking bellows , " how the hell do you know when I 'm exaggerating ? When your big America makes a war , it 's far away . Your sons are n't killed close to home . Here everything is so near , everything is so dense . Separations are never forever . Wars are wars of neighbors . You see and hear the smoke and the shouts from your house . This whole country is one crappy kortijo . Everybody craps together , everybody knows everything , everybody hangs their laundry in each other 's face . That 's what it is . Crowded shit . One on top of the other , the living and the dead , all of them together . Everything in range of your hand and everything in range of your eye , and everybody who 's killed is killed at a distance of two or three hours from home . Four at the most . Then you go  | there . And I 'm not the only one who 's exaggerating I 've heard that about other parents . I know exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the last piece of ground he lay on . And suddenly Non understand about the blood that shouts from the earth . Not just understand , you hear it . " We left Mother 's and Benjamin 's graves . Jacob apologized for shout ing and suggested we also visit Yehiel 's grave . " After all , he was your good friend when you were a boy , was n't he ? You should know that I also visit him sometimes . Not much . Every time I go to Benjamin 's grave . I was n't a friend of his like you were , but I always go to those who were killed in the War of Independence and the Sinai campaign . Almost nobody takes care of their graves anymore . Most of the parents are dead by now , the brothers and sisters are old , live far away , want to live their own lives . They do n't come much . " He bent over , brushed a few pine needles off the tombstone , and pulled out a few shoots coming up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before Memorial Day , some Arab worker from the village council suddenly shows up-to get things in shape , " he said . " All the petunias and little cactuses and violets are dead by now Nothing grows on their graves but hardy wildflowers and weeds . Black and red ants have already built their nests under the ground , among the bones , and the tombstone is n't white anymore , it 's covered with moss and bird shit and pine needles , and the names are n't so sharp and clear anymore . And that 's how it should be , that 's how a grave should be . " Joshua Edelman was one of the regular nightly customers of the bakery . He was one of a group of new immigrants from Poland who had plots of land and huts at the edges of the village fields . The settlement institutions , in a moment of whimsical Zionism , had sent them here to grow jasmine for the French perfume industry . In Krakow Edelman had been an expert in casting platinum , and there he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him telling Father his  | tragedy and though his mouth was full of bread and tears , I understood that the accident that killed his loved ones involved two locomotives , two engineers , one lineman , and four bottles of vodka . " ' They were drinking all the way they were drinking , " he kept saying over and over . The grief that never dissolves , the yearning for his dead son ? " He was so much like me he was " ? the longed-for smell of his wife that even the jasmine flowers could n't erase from his memory or his fingertips , drove him out to our bakery every night . IIe would buy a loaf of bread and ease his sorrow in it . le 'd sit on the bench and chew very slowly . Absentmindedly he would bring his fingers up to his nose and smell the memory of his wife with his eyes shut . Onlv then did he dare to return to the jasmine beds , for only love and yearning could immunize him against the seductive venom of the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning so thev 'd have time to help gather the flowers before the heat of the sun lobbed them of their perfume . When they got to school , they were so drugged and weary they fell asleep at their desks . One of them was Itsik Edelman , Joshua 's remaining son , who was in the same class as Jacob and Inc , and even then had the disgusting habit of talking about himself in the third person . Anybody talks like that is the cheat ! " declared Mother , adding that ltsik had another very unfortunate quality : " The face of a Gypsy " Bich meant that even now you could see he 'd grow up to be a thief . The 1 ears proved Mother right , but in those days I did n't know that was what a hit lire thief looked like . On the other hand , I did discover that Itsik looked amazingly like Philip II of Spain ; Yehiel Abramson had shown me his por-t rail by Antonio Moro , to make me understand Till Eulenspiegel . Joshua Edelman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was always proffering maxims like " The dog barks but the cat meows " or " I le who has money does n't need charity , " and weighty truths like " You must n't believe a person who lies . " One night when he bought his loaf of bread , he said to Father , " He who does n't eat remains hungry in the end . " Father , whose feelings of goodness and brotherhood were always stirred by such cliches , answered , " How true , " and Joshua smiled and got up and helped him drag a sack of flour . Since he was n't rebuffed , he began corning every night , and also helped load the pans , sift the flour , and even knead , and Father paid him a salary of two loaves of bread , an attentive ear , a pair of shoes , and work clothes he did n't use because he preferred his enormous gray underpants . " Put on your glasses and look at the worker , " Jacob whispered to me , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , Edelman 's testicles hung down almost to his knees .  | Two years later , when he had become part of the bakers ' . Joshua asked Father to take him on as a regular worker . " I do n't sleep at night anyway I do n't sleep , " he said . I le settled right in and suggested that Father bake a roll called Knipele , and when that proved to be ppular , Fat her raised his salary and let him bring Itsik along , " so he can help and learn . " Orphanhood had sharpened Itsik 's senses in dealing with adults . Ile and Mother became enemies . " That there Itsik is snake , " she kept repeating . " He 's just like the Ibrahim of the Duduch . " But Itsik was a diligent lad and a devoted son . He cooked meals for his father , played checkers with him , and laundered his work underpants , as if he read a softness and weakness in him no one else could see . " I have the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say proudly , and his boy would hug him and say , " Itsik loves his daddy " for a long time Jacob pondered Chenou Apari 's strange instructions , and finally he took Father 's shaving mirror from the bathroom , waited in the street for Leah , and when she came he aimed the mirror at her and blinded her . Leah bent her head , turned away , and covered her face with her hands , but Jacob danced around her and kept beaming the sunlight at her . " You ugly son of a bitch , " she finally screamed at him with startling coarseness . " My father will come back and take off your stupid head ! " Jacob smiled , skipped back to the yard , and lay in wait for her from that day on , surprising her with his salvos of sun . His new method and his devotion to her made Leah so mad she shut herself up in her house . Jacob took the mirror , climbed up on the bakery chimney , and aimed the sunbeams at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mirror was too small , and the capering spot of light dwindled and vanished . Jacob came down and walked around for a few hours , immersed in thought , and the next day he went to Simon and whispered a plan in his  | rat . Simon was eleven years old , and he already had the hands of a blacksmith and a heart that knew neither fear nor hesitation . Ile went into our parents ' room , yanked out the middle door of the clothes closet , the one with the mirror attached to it , and helped Jacob take it up to the brick Chinurcv of the bakery . The big spot of light ran groping over the field , slid across the red loam like a shining tablecloth , flickered on the grasses , and climbed trembling up the walls of Leah 's house until it caught her window and broke into her room on the roof . A moment later the small amazed figure was standing at the glowing window , shading her eyes with one hand and waving furiously with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could n't see Jacob because it dazzled her . The shutters of her window banged together so hard we heard it in our house . She does n't see you anymore , " I said . " ' That does n't matter . She knows I 'm here , and here I shall stay , " my brut her replied smugly . But now he encountered an unexpected obstacle in the person of Mot her , who had bought new hairpins on the advice of Chenou Apari , and wanted to see what she looked like in the mirror . " I 'm coming up to you ! " she threatened Jacob . When he did n't answer , Mot her climbed up to the stolen mirror and sat next to him on the edge of the chimney , combed her hair and put rouge on her cheeks . F'ather 's rage flared . " Get down from there , putana ! " he whispered madly from the yard , trying not to rouse the neighbors to come look . Ile stamped his feet , panted and gnashed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temper anymore , he ran into the bakery , stuck his head in the oven and screamed into it , as usual . But this time he forgot to close the flue , and his curses , amplified by the echo chamber of the oven 's belly , rose up through the chimney like a tremendous wave , and the mirror tottered and broadcast them over the whole village . All the neighbors came out of their houses , and Brinker ran to our yard scared and angry , as if he were about to attack Father , but as fast as he had come , he turned around , went back , and disappeared . " Get down , Mother , just get down , " Jacob pleaded , for he knew that Leah too saw and heard . But Mother laughed , examined her reflection in the mirror again , patted his shoulder , and went down . That evening , when she told Chenou Apari about Jacob 's new method , Chenu clapped her hands and shouted , " 1'reparez la mouchoir , we soon will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chimney Father was fit to be tied . He simply could n't bear the " idle sitting , " the atmosphere of aimlessness the love-stricken mother and son spread over the lumsc , and as usual with him , he kept expanding his circle of rage . I lc called Duduch " stupid as a cow at Hanukah prayers " ; he said that Simon had " iron teeth and cotton brains " ; that Mother was " the belle of Albania " ; I was " a /xashariko studying arithmetic in a beehive " ; and Jacob was pezgado kurshunn. l lc claimed we should go back to the days when the right of courtship was n't in the emotional hands of lovers but in the experienced care of matchmakers , " who know the good way , " and have fluent tongues , neat brains , and hearts that beat at a moderate , even tempo . The arguments about the mirror continued until two police motorcycles roared into the yard one day , followed by an official black Humber , and Father was terrified . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , had found him out and come to arrest him for stealing the Patriarch 's carriage . And , in fact , the same English detective who once asked me about the woman from Jerusalem did get out of the car . Now he stared at me sternly , laughing at the same time , and behind him emerged a thin man with thick glasses and a pleasant expression . That was Arthur Spinney , who had rescued my uncle Elijah from the gallows many years before along with General Allenby . Tia Duduch recognized him immediately , grabbed Simon by the hand , and went to him . " Mrs. Nathan , " said Spinney excitedly . He gave her a splendid package containing a few bolts of fine English wool , a black dress , and black shoes . His assistant , a tall , balding Englishman , opened the trunk of the car and took out cardboard boxes full of Lipton tea , Columbian coffee , canned pineapple from Natal , tubes of Nestles , bottles of Cabri water , and chocolate whose smell overwhelmed Simon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ibrahim , what are you doing ? " she whispered her motto in a brand-new tone . She grasped Spinney 's hand , showered kisses on it , and burst into tears . Arthur Spinney had a heart that was soft , Christian , and large , and mists of pity and emotion quickly fogged the thick lenses of his glasses . It 's interesting , I do n't remember what his face looked like , but only the fact that he was very nearsighted . I suppose his vision was even worse than mine and Jacob 's , and I am amused by the notion that it is because of his nearsightedness and not my own that he is preserved in my memory as such a blurry image . " They assigned me to the cavalry because a horse 's eyes were better than mine , " he used to say about himself with the humor of Anglican clergymen he had inherited from his forefathers .  | Palestine transformed Arthur Spinney from a cavalryman into a merchant . In the first battle for Gaza lie won a medal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his staff and , after the surrendc-of Jerusalem , put him in charge of evacuating the wounded by train . Vic front moved north and the trains of the wounded went south to Egypt , leaving behind trails of sirens , shrieks of pain , and columns of smoke . Like manv others , Arthur Spinney aspired to leave his mark on the chronicles of the Holy Land , but the good places in history were already taken by those who had elbowed their way in , and Spinney knew he would never ascend to royalty , establish a new religion , utter a prophecy , or lead a regiment . Instead he invented the milking car : he bought a few milk cows from the Mikveh Israel agricultural school and put them in a freight car padded with straw and connected to trains crossing the desert . Now , he announced proudly , the chaps could enjoy " a decent cup of English tea . " The milking car did n't change the face of history , but it did make Spinney 's name famous in the British army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of all the army canteens in this country . When he was discharged from the . army , he opened his first general store at Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem and hired no , uncle Elijah , first as a salesman and then as manager . That was the beginning of the nicest empire of all those that have tilled the East . Spinney 's department stores sprouted up one after another in Jerusalem , Nablus , Tel Aviv , Alexandria , Beirut , Baghdad , and Limassol , pleasant islands of decency , sobriety , and reliability in a region that traded in lies , anguish , and honor . Spinney attracted a lot of customers to his stores . His motto was " Fine merchandise at reasonable prices . " He sold cheese from Hebron , chocolate from Liege , wooden buttons from Damascus , tin forks from Portugal , mineral water he bottled himself from the springs of Cabri , horsemeat sausages from Hungary , lace tablecloths from Normandy , and butter from Lithuania . Every morning Elijah would come to the store , sprinkle attar of roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies and shillings to make change . And at a quarter to eight he would open the doors . He spoke with every customer in his own language , and at the request of his boss he covered his premature baldness with a tarboosh . And in my innocence I thought you were paying me for what 's in my head , not for what 's on it , " Elijah protested , and Spinney laughed and patted him on the back . Every now and then he recalled the strange day he and Allenby took Elijah down from the portable gallows in the Kolarasi cellar , and was glad he had heeded the general 's advice and taken the young man under his  | wing . When Elijah was killed in the pogroms of 1929 , he decided to look after his widow , but I ) iuluch disappeared from the city and it took the detective he hired eight years to locate her ' with us . he had done fine work . Arthur Spinney knew every detail about us . I lc brought Eat her two bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cologne . He brought Mother a blue flowered dress that had short puffed sleeves and went splendidly with her hair and eyes and the long line of her hips . For me he had a real surprise . That month Orson Welles had broadcast the radio play War of the Worlds , and Spinney brought me a gorgeous edition of the book with the original illustrations by Walter Ernst , which was n't even in Yehiel 's library . And he brought Jacob a leather case with a blue " Katav " fountain pen , blotters , paper , and envelopes , for writing love letters . " Happy hunting . " With a smile , he quoted Kipling 's wolf pack . " But I want a mirror , " Jacob whispered . " He brought everybody what they want , and I want a mirror . " " You got a present , " said Father . " Where 's your dignity ? " " But I need a mirror ! " cried Jacob . " Not paper . " " Shame ! What kind of son are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed . Even though he did n't understand Hebrew , he sensed that he had chanced on a quarrel between husband and wife . But by that time , Father had lost a considerable part of his manners . He no longer bothered to disguise his hatred and contempt , and did n't hesitate to berate Mother in front of us , in front of the neighbors , even in front of strangers . " A cow on the seventh candle of Hanukah , " he now aimed a new and obscure insult at her . " All I have to do is breathe , and even that is n't right , " said Mother . Embarrassed and pale , she turned around , climbed the porch steps , and disappeared inside the house . I hope I succeed in describing my mother as she was . She was the most complex simple woman I 've ever known . Other women always had trouble understanding her , and each and every man understood her in his own way . She was a child held captive in the mighty body of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving him with the worst love of all  --  the love that has no reason and lacks hope . Awkwardly , blindly , with an explosive force without measure or restraint , she wooed him and did n't understand that their life together had made him a hunter of faults . He trapped , identified , and described them in such a way that she could never guess the next insult and fortify herself for the impending blow . He found  | fault with the food she cooked him , the way she walked , the defective syntax of her speech , the way she sliced bread , peeled cucumbers , hung laundry . With her smile , the movement of her comb , the way she sat , and the sound of her sneeze . Even the childish position she slept in  --  on her back , arms and legs spread out , as he had first seen her in the valley where they met roused his fury . How do you lie there ? " he sneered . " Like a Yemenite baba t hev threw into a basiniko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read on Spinney 's face the rebuke he deserved . " Tell him , tell him something in English , " he urged me , but I did n't know what to say . What should I tell that amiable man ? I fumed and followed Mother , who was already standing in the kitchen grinding meat . What did n't she do to win his heart ? She was turning the handle of the grinder , wiping her nose with the back of her hand , closing her eyes so as not t o sec the meat  --  in vain . She wanted me to teach her to read and write , and she could n't learn . Pencils broke between her fingers , black flowers bloomed on her tongue and lips , and the paper was strewn with holes , slivers of graphite , and tiny Rorschach blots of ink and tears . Her hope melted away . In despair she waited for her encounters with Chenou Apari . In despair she combed her hair and made herself beautiful . In despair she bought a new dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain . And all that time my father seeks her in her body , walks to her on the mountain paths , the spot of her hair flickering in front of him , bandits all around him , deer rush up the mountains . Her picture above his eyes , her long legs next to his head . The wet coils of your hair . The surge of your body . So much rain . A week later the mirror arrived , packed between two upright boards in the back of the pickup truck , padded with cardboard and cotton . Jacob made a frame of iron bars for it and mounted it on a hinge on the chimney so he could move it and aim it .  | He was beside himself with happiness . At two in the afternoon , when the sun reached the proper angle , he put on a straw hat , took a bottle of water and half a loaf of bread in a bag , packed up some paper and hooks so he could do his homework there , and clinched onto the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bench on the chimney , because one ( ; i he almost flew off in a sudden gust of wind . Days went by and rumors of my brother 's love were known all around . Even strangers would come see the fellow on the chimney . Once a newspaper photographer tried to take his picture , but Jacob noticed him and turned his mirror toward him . An awful shout of pain was heard , and the man fled with his hands over his eyes . He spent most of the afternoon hours of his youth there , persistent as a nesting stork , beaming without being consumed . The window of Leah 's room did n't open , but Jacob knew that she was there and that she knew he was on the chimney , and he knew that I was there too . " That 's not nice what you do , " Mother told me . " She invites me , " I said . " The Leah is the Jacob 's . " " The Leah is nobody 's , " mocked Father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a nod of encouragement . " She acts like that only to excite Jacob 's love . " " I 'm not worried , " said Jacob . " If she invited him , let him go to her . In the end she 'll be mine . " At night , in our room , I asked him if he really meant it . " Why should I care ? " he answered . " I already told everybody , in the end she 'll be mine . " My meetings with Leah started in the library . One day she came in as I was spreading moth poison in the cracks of the shelves . " Recommend a book to her , " Yehiel said , and I suggested Thai 's . When she got to the chapter where Paphnutius goes and sits on the high pillar , she brought the book back and told me angrily that if I was trying to help my brother , I would do better to mind my own business . She was about fifteen then , but living with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made her mature . We stood facing one another in the aisle between the big bookshelves , Leah ran her hand through the billows of her hair , and I fell in love with her . The signs were simple and clear , depressingly normal . Dryness . Heartbeats . Pressure and limpness . I assume you know them too , from your own flesh , from the flesh of your lovers , from books you 've read . But I felt one more sign , a special one , because I had expected it ever since I heard  | Chenou Apari tell Mother : ' And there 's also a kind of man whose knees talk to each other in Ms Ines when he falls in love ... In the days to conic I displayed my best wares to Leah . I quoted poetry to her , I stole Tia Duduch 's marvelous masapan from the pantry for her , I showed her the albums of ancient art that Yehiel did n't lend anyone , and I told her to read the The Story of San Michele . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a bear and I 'm a Lapp girl . " Suddenly she spun around and , with both hands , waved her skirt at me for a dazzling sliver of tune . I did n't have my glasses on at that moment . Her bare thighs gleamed like the halo of a distant cloud , the fog of her flesh seeped into my retinas. for a moment I thought I felt Jacob 's pains , but I understood immediately that it was my own torments that were searing me . Someday , if we meet , my dear , I 'll seduce you with Duduch 's masapan , too . At the Miriam Deli near my house , I once came upon that sticky deceit called Masapan of Toledo , and I teased the owner of the shop about it until she burst out laughing and put her hand on my arm as if inadvertently . A woman of about forty , she was , jolly and handsome , much like me in height and coloring , and I told her about my aunt 's masapan  --  the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only sweet that ' mikes women laugh when they taste it . " Masapan is the purest , simplest , and most sublime of all sweets , " I quoted from the Small Encyclopedia of the Kitchen by Otto Gustin , and t beat from Gregory VII before he became pope and was buried in the library of his mother 's palace : Among the sweet sins , the confection of Lubeck is well known , composed of only two ingredients  --  almonds and sugar ? which are not naturally opposed , except for the purpose of their common existence . " Even though he did n't mention it specifically by name , most researchers agree that he meant masapan . On the shop owner 's forehead , I saw a row of red dots that looked like the painful tracks of a centipede or the pricks of thorns . She felt my eyes staring at them and was embarrassed . When she was thirteen years old , she told me , she went to mass with her parents and accidentally chewed the holy wafer the priest put on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar of her blouse turned red , and twenty years later the blood spots appeared on her forehead . " You could have made a career as a saint , " I told her . She laughed . " I 'm not a saint , " she said , and a bitter , long line was suddenly etched between her eyes . " God knows I 'm not . " I bought almonds and sugar from her , all night long I conjured up Duduch 's lessons , and the next afternoon I went back to the shop . I waved  | the little package at her and said , " The ideal match is man with masapan and a woman with stigmata . " Of all the women I 've met in America I love her the most . When I enter her house , she collects the sweet title I bring her , and still chewing and laughing , she strips off all my clothes , takes my hand , and leads - nc to the shower . There , with complete faith I entrust my glasses to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalding water over me , she does n't discriminate between poor and rich , is neither put off nor turned on . " Close your eyes . " She shampoos my hair , towels me dry with her strong hands until my skin turns red , and leads me to the bedroom . We always make love the same way . " He who knows what is good no longer needs experiments , " she laughs . Afterward she lets me sleep in her bed a bit , and when I wake up she urges me to come eat . She makes me wonderful French fries . One day she revealed her secret to me : she fries them in coconut oil . When she took the can of oil with the ancient label out of the pantry , I burst out laughing . Ever since then , even though she does n't like it , I call her " Madame Cocosin . " One day I made her a mezelik from delicacies I garnered in her store : black olives I removed from their can and dried with coarse salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small hard pretzels , Zoga anchovies , sharp , dry San Sebastian cabanos . We spent two hours of contentment over a few glasses of raki . I hope you 're not laughing now and suspecting me of nostalgia . Even that table of delicacies was merely an exercise in memory , like the platter of jewelry with which Lurgan Sahib tested Kim 's memory . So many facts with neither rhyme nor reason are amassed in me that I must become a merchant of antiquities of myself , burrowing in attics , sifting through heaps of garbage and dust , until a Mnemosyne rises in my mind 's eye and waves her skirt at Inc . Speak , Memory . Speak and do n't stop . Draw from the deep well of Thomas Mann 's past , float on Melville 's warm sea , cut into the living flesh of the prophet Jeremiah . Lie in amber , swim in vitriol . Joseph Conrad , in the voice of Marlow , told me , " I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and awful pas-sage . " Saint Augustine compared memory to a warehouse , to a spacious field , to a large temple where he encountered himself . I 'm constantly reexamining the burrows of my memory , shoring up its shifting sands , cleaning its gutters of fallen leaves . When we were children , Mother would turn on the faucet in a thin stream to encourage me and Jacob to urinate . Now too all I need is the slight stimulus of one taste bud , of the auditory labyrinth , one olfactory cell , one retinal cone . All I need is 168  | one lock of hair , blurry and chestnut , plundered by my glasses from the head of a woman passing by , or the gleam of her white shoulder . All I need is a red column of dust , the dull copper ring of a bell . Leah loved to weave wreaths hs of blue flowers , to hear stories , to laugh , and to put puzzles together . The fields supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the puzzles came to her in packages her father sent . l le was still " abroad , " and no one really knew whether he was an important figure in the Jewish Agency , a famous violinist , an English spy , or a diamond merchant . She refused to talk about him , and I did n't tell her I had seen him the day he fled . Because of my nearsightedness I would put my face right up to the puzzle . " You 're in the way , " she would say and push me . We wrestled , laughed with delight , rolled around on the floor . A fruity vapor blew from her mouth to mine , the cascade of her hair poured over my chest and tickled my palms , a terrible eternal flame from the love light Jacob beamed at her window glowed in the room . " Your brother 's crazy , " she said . Lying on her stomach , her face buried in a pillow , she moved her hair aside so I could stroke her neck . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside a bit to relieve the heat . Then she opened them a bit more to be sure , and finally she opened them even more to be blinded . All the while , she was muttering reproaches very very softly  --  but it was n't clear if she were cursing or prophesying ? with the seriousness and proficiency of a street urchin , out of harmony with her beauty : " Drop dead , go get buried , you stinker , you ass , may crows peck out your eyes , may Gypsies tattoo your prick , may the Mufti come visit you every night , may you drown in pig shit , may all your fingers fall off . " Once , after four hours of Jacob 's light salvos , when the sun at last went down , I went for a walk with Leah , and Jacob approached us . He stopped to tell me to come help unload a truck of flour sacks , but he did n't say a word to Leah . The two of them ignored one another completely , as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't tell her about his sleepless nights , and she did n't tell him that she watched him through the cracks in the shutter , but his red eyes and her eyes always squinting , and her face always tan even in winter , betrayed their habits . Flour sacks are heavy and limp as corpses , and when you carry them you have to run at the right speed , a compromise between your force and the force of gravity : if you run too fast , you 'll stumble and fall down . If you walk slowly , your knees will melt like candles . Jacob and Father stood on the truck , loaded the sacks onto Mother 's and my shoulders , and we carried them to the storeroom . Particles of flour  | were crushed in my mouth and mixed with spit and sweat . Lead was poured into my limbs . Vl'IWat I should have understood back in Yeliiel 's library became clear to me in Father 's pain clinic : that it is better to describe what the other person already knows so lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his understanding . I assume you are not yet experienced in the labor of unloading flour sacks from a truck ; so , if you need a literary description of this task , you will find that too in Tracy 's Tiger , although Saroyan describes sacks of coffee beans , which , heavy as they may be , will never equal the dead weight of flour . At any rate , running with the sack always ended with a brief , tormenting climb on the piles of previous stacks , and when I stumbled there this time , I discovered a cloth bag hidden behind one of them . That evening , I went back and found the bag with a green book inside , and on the binding , it said : Cent manieres de la seduction francaise . In it were pictures that gave me an urgent need for a blood transfusion . I quickly returned the book of seductions to its hiding place and ran to get Jacob so we could enjoy the loot together . Marvelous , strange women paraded through the pages . Plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ostrich feathers on their behinds , short ones with thick eyebrows and disheveled curls . They were costumed in provocative transparent corsets ; they drank pearls dissolved in vinegar , ate nacre and asparagus , and wore net brassieres that penetrated us with an observant double gaze . Pearl eyes winked from their navels , and mustached , toothless smiles peeped from their wide-open muslin panties . " Chenou Apari must have given that to Mother , " I said . Jacob assaulted me , but I grabbed him violently . Even though . I was stronger , I had trouble restraining him . We fell onto the sacks in a clinch , and I was forced to squeeze him in my arms until he coughed and cried and begged me to stop . In those days Mother was all of thirty-five , but she looked very old to us . Only now that I 'm much older than she was then , and I look at the four pictures of her that were kept after she died , especially the one Isaac Brinker took of her  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that despite the hard work and Father 's indifference and mockery , she was at the height of her beauty , and that Romi looks more and more like her every day . But Jacob , who had n't yet won Leah 's heart then , was terrified of one thing  --  the enormous distance that suddenly gaped between him and the real magicians of seduction . He sat down and banged the book shut . " How ugly that is , " he said . " How disgusting . "  | I told him the famous joke about the algebra teacher and the ski champion , but Jacob did n't laugh or say anything . I thought he was in despair ? over me and over love  --  but the next day my brother went hack to his mirror , and persisted . Time passed , did its work , and did n't pay any attention to us . By now , the two of us knew how to identify the snares our bodies set for us , but love refined the urgings of flesh . Jacob found refuge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding Leah and sending her his heliographic letters , and I went on bringing her books written by other authors and sentences of love written by me with hovering fingers on her back . " What does that mean ? ' we were friends ' ? " Romi asked a hard ques-t ion . " And what did Dad say ? " I kissed her with a dry throat and a yearning heart , I breathed the air from her mouth , I covered myself with her braids , and I dared to stroke her young breasts through the cloth of her blouse . My thighs tasted the throbbing warmth of her flesh , but I did n't sleep with her . Even now I do n't understand why . The possibility did n't even occur to me . " Why do n't you break that mirror of his ? " she asked me one day . " Why should I ? " " You 're weird , " she told me . " The two of you are really weird . I should throw both of you out and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field between her house and the village on our way to the library , with Jacob 's spot of light running ahead of us . He memorized the times of Leah 's comings and goings and the routes she took . When she left the house , the big spot of light was waiting for her on the threshold , moving and quivering in place , and wherever she went it accompanied her and capered in front of her , dragged at her feet like a bright rag of devotion , scaled her dress , and convulsed on the ground . " You think Yehiel 's got somebody ? " she asked when we reached the door of the library .  | " I do n't think so , but sometimes he goer to the city . " And then I laughed . " You know what Edelman says about Yehcil ? Hc who does n't get married ends up a bachelor . ' " By then I allowed myself to sec Yehiel not only as a guide and friend but also as a source of amusement . " Only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand me . " He quoted Friedrich Hegel 's last words to me . " That 's nonsense ! " I told him . " Come on , Yehiel . " Yehiel was shocked and furious . " Nonsense ? ! " he shouted . " Nonsense ? ! Hegel on his deathbed is nonsense ? ! " " That 's like saying , That 's the end , or maybe the beginning , ' " I said . " Or Will they forgive me up there for not being myself ? ' " " Who said that ? " Yehiel got excited . " Nobody . I 'm just giving you examples of more nonsense . " " Yes , but who said it ? " The librarian was frothing . " Nobody , Yehiel . " I was angry . " I made it up right this minute . " But Yehiel did n't believe me . He recorded my last words in his notebook , and next to them he wrote , Anonymous . " When we came out of the library , Leah and I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going so fast we jumped onto the side of the road in panic . A cloud of reddish dust rose in its wake ; Noah Brinker was driving , and his father was lying in the back , bleeding and unconscious . Brinker , we found out later , had been hit in the head by an irrigation pipe . " He was wounded by love , " Chenou Apari enthused ; only it was n't Brinker 's own love that hit him but the love of his son . Noah Brinker was attached to Mr. Cocosin 's daughter , whose name I 've forgotten by now , but I still have a clear memory of what she looked like . From a fat little girl she grew up to be a lascivious dwarf whose enormous Ishtar-like behind tried to compensate for her total lack of a neck . For several months Noah had been telling her constantly that she was beautiful , until she believed him . Apparently , " said Leah , " Noah Brinker has the ability to persuade , " because that Purim his beloved went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen Esther beauty contest . Dead Livy , who had an inordinately elevated estimate of her son , abhorred the girl and said she devoted herself with equal ardor both to the men of the Hagana and to the members of the dissident organizations , and gave the English their due as well . I suppose she also granted Noah Brinker her favors ; otherwise I ca n't understand the longing she roused in him . Noah loaded a length of irrigation pipe on his shoulder , and as he was walking , out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of the elfin figure of his beloved  --  rattling along and desirable as she was  --  between the trees of  | air next plantation . I Ic spun around to sec her better , and the heavy pipe on his shoulder whistled a quarter-circle in the air , struck his father 's left temple like a clapper , and laid him on the ground with a split skull and a month full of blood . When he woke up in the hospital , Brinker could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already at his bedside , where he stayed all night , and the next clay he came and told Mother that his brother was afflicted with aphasia . Brinker 's blood , as was explained in the village , had flooded an entire part of his brain , drowning and choking the words in it . " Fran Levy . " Professor Fritzi cleared his throat softly and did n't look her in the eye . " Even we in medicine do n't understand everything . If you could visit my brother , as a neighbor , of course , that could help very much . " Mother went there and came back sad and gloomy . Dead Livy sat at her husband 's bedside and did n't say a thing when Brinker recognized Mother and Ins hand groped until it found hers . He shook all over , sweated , groaned , but could n't get anything out of his mouth except weeping and bleating . My brother 's hand is in mine . The stump of his finger twitches like a fledgling . The bread truck has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven pit . " You know , I never told anybody , but once I went to a workshop  --  you know , the kind they set up for bereaved parents . They called me from the Ministry of Defense and recommended it . At first I did n't want to hear about it . I told them , I finished with you the day you sent me a form to fill out so you would recognize me as a bereaved father . You kill him , and then you 've got the nerve to make me run after you . And that word , workshop , ' also pissed me off . For me a workshop is a place where you work  --  blacksmiths , mechanics , not all kinds of psychologists . But I do n't know , somehow I went . " I went and it was terrible . There were people there who had never met each other . It was our dead children that brought us all together in the same room . There was one mother who had lost two sons . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one war . What is this ? God 's jumping over his own bellvbutton ? And there was a father , a policeman , canto in uniform , broken into pieces , as if they had put hint through a meat grindct . A beautician who brought along her surviving daughter , a little ten-wear-old girl with terrible facial tics , and she kept talking about her son and how successful he was . Peach , ' she called him . ' My Peach . ' Everybody started in right away , everybody had his own Peach . What should they do  --  keep quiet ? And all the time the psychologist is telling them : ' Palk , get everything out , let it all out . That 's what they say : Let it out . I could n't stand it . That Peach of hers , but I did n't say anything . I thought maybe I 'd tell them how I made myself Michael , how much I wanted another child and how I did it . But I 'm not used to talking to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead children , not the living ones , and I do n't have much to say about Benjamin , and what I do have I 'd rather not . After all , we know what he was . A good boy , but that 's it . Nothing special . Romi is superior to him in every way . Her heart , her mind , everything . And Michael 's a dream . A little angel . Leah should have gotten up to see him . I did n't even make a memorial pamphlet for Benjamin because he did n't leave anything in writing . Maybe I should have made a booklet with pictures of all the girls he had . " " Daddy ? Are you in there ? " Michael 's voice comes from outside and paints a watercolor of pleasure and love on my brother 's face . " I 'm here , Michael . Come here , son . " The sun is still low A long , thin shadow anticipates its little owner . Jacob got up and hid behind the door , and when Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , rocked him , and swung him in the air . " Now we 'll make you into a sweet challah . " He put his son into the old kneading box , squeezed him delicately with soft , tickling fists , lifted him up , and laid him on the worktable . He sprinkled fine white flour on him and kneaded his belly , stuck gentle fingers in his back , pressed his thighs and the muscles of his calves , and Michael laughed and wailed and squirmed with pleasure . " Who do you belong to ? " " Daddy , Daddy . " " This is my child , " Jacob tells me over and over . " Look at him . I made him . " The longing for a baby , he recalled , was too hard to bear and too sweet to contain , hardening and softening , blazing and freezing . The village children knew that if they got to the bakery early , they would get a roll , a gift  | from the - melancholy baker who worked there . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry because his eyes ripped off their dresses and stared at their bellies and crotches . " Even at Benjamin 's funeral I thought about that , " he said . " I could n't help mvself . " There were so many women there . It was amazing . I never saw so many pretty girls as at his funeral . Who would have guessed such a thing ? Likc a flock of colored butterflies had landed in the cemetery . Like the flowers that crazy old Arab grew , the one who had all those pots on the balcony in Jerusalem , remember ? In the military sector . Girls from the agricultural school , girl soldiers , girl students . Even his history teacher from high school was there . Not with the other women teachers , but with the girls . Even two fifty-year-old bags who came together from Tel Aviv in an American convertible and hugged each other and cried and cried and cried , like two cats at night . Cried over my child who must have done with them all the things I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do again in my life . " His fist clenched in his pocket . And Benjamin was n't even in his grave before I wanted a new son . Like Tia Duduch . I had to have a baby . " My brother 's expression was soft and proud now . " They loved him . he had something I never had , that ease with them , the knowledge that a woman is n't a sprite or a witch or a demon or an angel . Things I understood only one night , and that most men do n't know and do n't understand until they have a daughter and watch her grow up . But by then it 's too late . And does n't do anybody any good . " Suddenly he laughed and blushed . And when I say daughter , ' I do n't mean Romi . " And the women , who were familiar with charming flirtatious winks , blinking flesh , and the pain of a dry palate , could n't interpret my brother 's look , in which the sadness of entreaty blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sense of common mourning of beloved women and their pleasure of belonging to the dead , which is lugubrious indeed , but not unbearable . They shuffled their feet uneasily , hugged each other , and wiped each other 's black and blue tears . A few years later Romi brought a friend home from the army , a fullbodied , friendly girl , ugly to look at , yearning for touch and love . The two girls made dinner together , and that night , when the bread started rising and spreading its smell , she suddenly appeared in the bakery . " That smell would n't let me sleep , " she said , embarrassed . " I 'm not used to it . " She stood next to the gareh , looked at Jacob , Itsik , and Joshua , and when the first loaves cooled , my brother sliced some bread for her .  | " Slit held it in both hands and ate like an animal .

At most , she would have said no . But I was scared she 'd tell Romi , and Romi really is n't capable of understanding such things . Or she would have come and photographed us in bed for her exhibit . " He turned Michael over again , braided his arms and legs , and the child dissolved in loud , shrill giggles , and gurgled and cooed when his father tickled his back with the big glaze brush . He covered Michael 's nipples and eyelids with raisins , sprinkled poppy seeds on his belly , knees and chest , filled the hollow of his navel with yellow sesame seeds , and stuck a bakery label on his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he announced .

Brinker stayed in the hospital a few weeks , and when he came back home , he dragged his right leg , had trouble understanding the news on the radio , and spoke nonsense . By now he managed to get a few words out of his throat , but he could n't write , and he had forgotten most of the nouns he once knew . The rules of syntax and usage were erased from  | his brain .

" He was educated enough to understand the nature of his illness , wise enough to suffer depression , and diligent enough to try to recover as fast as possible . A few weeks later Noah Brinker came and inquired obsequiously if I wanted him to take me for " a ride on his Matchless motorcycle " ; when I refused , he asked if I wanted to " make a few cents , " proposing I teach his father the words he had forgotten . I had always liked Brinker , and now an unexpected devotion to him arose in me . Every day I gave him a lesson . " What 's a pen , Brinker ? " " Pen . . . pen . . . to see . . . " He searched in a drawer , pulled out a pen , and his face lit up . " Here , I see .... Pen . To write . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see it . . . . Live in a house . " " Is there also a house in Jerusalem , Brinker ? ' " Maybe ... no . . . No see . . . Jerusalem . " After a few lessons a malicious idea took shape in my heart : to teach Brinker new words that were wrong . But since every lesson vanished from his brain in five minutes , I gave up the plan . " Once you used to come to me , " Leah said , " and now you spend all clay with that idiot . " " You can join us , " I told her . " It 's very interesting , and he wo n't get mad . " " I do n't have strength for him , " she said . " And he 's not an idiot , " I explained . " He understands everything and has every ounce of his sense . " " Really . The Vilna Gaon . " And her face clouded over . " Such strange weather , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwest , made the sea turgid , and covered the gleam of the sky . Salty air grated between your teeth and scratched your lungs . Brinker was as restless as an animal . He looked at me and said , " Mother ... mother . " " Very good , Brinker , " I said . " What is mother ? " " Mother , " Brinker repeated , " mother . " And suddenly tears and words and sweat burst out all over his face . " We would also go fifteen and then  | you do n't know the day before yesterday , in the held because nobody and only mot her . " He rummaged like . a madman in his desk drawer , took out the amber block with the fly , and stuck it i --  my pocket without a word . " For ... for .. now , " he said . An awful grief was reflected in his eyes , and a gratitude and love he wanted me to understand and convey . A host of stars is in the sky . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ? Which do I choose for mine ? Oh , yes , you 're the one who 's spoken , Yes , yes , you my heart have broken . That 's what I sang to him , but Brinker only shook his head no and did n't say a word . As I returned home , the setting sun looked like a sick eye through the reddish curtains of dust . Dogs stuck their tails between their legs and howled , cats licked themselves incessantly , and even the shabby crows whose noisy insolence is n't distracted by anything were silent and kept their heads bowed . That night , Father told us to add a little sugar and hot water to the yeast to reinforce it in its war with the salt and dust . He turned on the motor of the kneading machine and said to Jacob , " You have n't got a chance with her , stupid . You sit on the roof like a bird while your brother visits her . " Jacob smiled . He never attached much importance to Father 's diagnoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing all by itself ever since he got the mirror , while Leah 's indifference grew stronger . Contrary to convention , he did n't waste away , no lines of grief were etched on his face , his feet did n't stumble , and his eyes did n't sink into their sockets . Love beamed from his eyes , stubbornness smoothed his skin , and hope strengthened his flesh , but did n't grant him the gift of prophecy . Even now , when I recall that night , I still see things from the side , though at that moment when Leah entered the bakery I was in the picture . I was struggling with a sack of flour that refused to be dragged to the sifter , Itsik Edelman was arranging pans , Jacob and Father were standing at the kneading machine cutting the dough into chunks , Joshua was in position at the table . Mother and Simon were n't working that night . Jacob 's job was to lift the dough out of the big bowl of the kneading  | machine and stretch it so Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inv deal , hotly ( ur this incident and in answer to your question about Duke Anton 's decorated rolls , that dough is a cunning and deceitful matemil It may look spongy and submissive , but it is clastic and strong , heavy and rebellions , and when it starts rising , even steel doors wo n't stop it . Jacob leaned over the bowl , thrust his hands into the dough , straightened up forcefully , pulling out a decent chunk , and Father sundered it with a long , old butcher 's knife the ritual slaughterer had sold him because its blade was nicked and so it was declared unfit for that purpose . Every day the knife was honed on a barber 's strop , and it was so sharp it passed through the dough like a cold wind . Joshua Edelman waited at the table , pulled the big chunks Jacob put down , and with a loud bang of the cleaver , he chopped them into smaller pieces each weighing exactly " nine decos , " as Edelman called nine hundred grams . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales sitting next to him . Wielding his cleaver , he would cut a piece that was somewhat bigger than necessary , and , after a quick , precise , appraising squeeze , he pinched off a tiny strip , and smiled to himself with pleasure because he knew that he now held a loaf of exactly nine decos in his hand . The moon rose in the window with its soft , pink , whorish light . " Why does n't he weigh it on the scale ? " Jacob got mad . The haze made him jumpy and irritable , and he had more faith in measuring instruments than iii the worker 's experience and the wisdom of his hands . Father chuckled . " Edelman 's hands are like the scales of a Bukharan goldsmith , " he said . " He who works precisely never makes a mistake . " Joshua smiled at Jacob , and another wave of rage passed over my brother . " Someday they 'll come from the inspector 's office to weigh the bread , and there 'll be hell to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine again , and with an effort , pulled another chunk of dough for Father to cut off . Then , in that sweaty moment , as Father was brandishing the knife and I was dragging the sack to the sifter and my brother was lifting the load of dough and we were all groaning with the heat and the strain , the screen door suddenly banged and Father shouted , " Who did that ? Now the dough fell ! " We all turned around and saw Leah coming into the bakery , light and fresh as a nocturnal flower . Silence fell . Leah was carrying a covered pan , and in the dim heat of the bakery she looked like a princess who had come down to visit her slaves in a mine . The oven fan drew the good smell off her dress and spread it through the dense space .  | " Hello , Leah , " I said . In those days , even though Yehicl did n't approve , We were reading Damon Ituiivon together in English , and We greeted each other with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the pan , and uncovered three big white rolls of strudel . " Mother would like to put these in your oven , " she said to Father . " We 're having company for the Sabbath , and there 's no room in our oven . " Father usually did n't allow people in the bakery during working hours . " A knock , a whistle , and a menstruating woman makes the dough fall , " he kept telling us . IIe let the village women put their cakes only in the " last oven , " on Friday morning , but he accorded Leah , the izhika con Gracia , special treatment . Sixteen years old she was then , her thick braid was wound around her head in two and a half circles , and she wore a blue cotton dress with short sleeves . When I put on my glasses , small white flowers with yellow sepals bloomed on her dress , and a strong , fresh smell of saffron filled the air . Leah 's eyes wandered around the bakery , and she suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even though it was a very brief look , it surprised him and lasted long enough to open gaping spaces in Jacob 's flesh and threaten to overpower him under the load of his feelings and his dough . His hands were fettered by a big , heavy chunk , and Father , who was already waving the knife over the dough , looked at him and was afraid because he knew what was about to happen , and knew there was no way to prevent it . " Hold the dough , dummy ! " he cried in terror . Five thousand years of baking have turned the baker 's movements into a category of fate . Father knew he could n't stop the knife midway in its course . " Hold on tight ! " Father pleaded . " Jacob ... " But Jacob was looking at Leah , and felt particles of irritating flour drying his throat , his bound hands getting wet with love and losing their grip on the heavy dough . " Do n't move , Jacob ... The thick layer of dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , and hid what happened : the fingers of Jacob 's right hand moved blindly in the dough , trying to improve their hold , and the slaugh-terer 's knife lopped off the littlest one of them . Jacob did n't make a sound . Only I  --  watching his face turn pale and dropping to the ground along with him  --  understood . Before he passed out he put the chunk down on the table , and when his body hit the floor , the stump of his finger popped out of the dough and gushed blood like the throat of a  | slaughtered cowLeah leaped back in fear . and you could see her own blood pounding under the thin skin of her neck . Father dashed over to lean on the wall . I , who was lying on the floor next to Jacob , got up , threw off my eyeglasses , and went to the window . Itsik Edelman turned white , and Joshua was the only one who did n't lose his head . He rushed to Jacob , wrapped the terrible wound iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glaze brush , grabbed the knife , and shouted , " We 've got to find the finger , got to ! " ? and fenced with the howl of the kneading machine like a clumsy Cyrano . " Good that he did n't shout , good that he did n't shout , " Father kept mumbling into the wall , but his hope was deceived . Within a minute , the old goose landed in the bakery , hissing and panting , with Mother and Brinker in his wake . Jacob lay on the floor in a puddle of blood . Leah 's pale neck was still humming and throbbing . Father was shaking all over . " They killed us the Jacob ! " Mother screamed at Leah and Father , and lo my amazement , despite the catastrophe , I felt a smile rising on my face , because I never imagined she would quote the beginning of a book . Once again the broad shoulders slowly turned , the arms opened , the flush rose from the chest to the throat and the face , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mother grabbed the heavy pan she h , id brought , pitched it after her , and the strudel wriggled in the air like thick pale corpses of snakes , opened up and dropped their sweet innards to the ground . She ran all the way home . She went up to her room , opened the window wide , lay down on the bed , and pressed her screaming mouth into the pillow . A wise and comely girl she was , but young and inexperienced . The knowledge she suddenly came into , knowledge that , in a normal life , is learned and processed and amassed over many long years , was heaped on her all at once and choked her throat with pincers of sobs . It was n't bad enough that the stubborn , clumsy son of a baker surprised her with such a terrible and vile sacrifice , but in the very same second it dawned on her t hat she would be his , that she would bear his children , and that in their future battles of love she would never win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Close to the Truth About People with Fictional Names ) 0 n June 22 , 1913 , a few minutes before sunrise over Jerusalem , a vali from Hebron appeared at the Gate of Mercy in a good humor , riding on his mare . The rising day was the longest of the year , and every summer it was the vali 's habit to circle the holy walls on that day . It was a ceremonial circuit , slow and stately , that began as the sun leaped up and ended precisely as it was sinking , and lasted long enough for him to recite the entire seventeenth surah of the Koran . Here we should stop and explain that there was no mistake concerning the aforementioned date and the vali was n't tardy . In the rest of the world the longest day of the year is June 21 , but in Jerusalem it is a day late because of the enormous gravitational pull of the foundation stone of the Temple . These facts are well-known , and have been recorded and described in many books , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ofeibach , as well more recent treatises , the most famous being Voyage de la Judee , la Samarie , la Galilee et le Liban . The vali looked to the east , and the moment the sun flickered above the Mount of Olives he shifted his mare to the left , tapped her neck , and began circling the city at a pace so perfectly attuned to the rotation of the earth that the common shadow of horse and rider grew neither longer nor shorter . And so it was that near ten o'clock , when the vali passed Nablus Gate and approached the mosaic of Orpheus , something terrible happened . Far away from there , near Baalbek , a Maronite peasant set fire to a pile of  | dry briars he had pulled out of his vineyard . The flames caught the edge of the next field , leaped into the grove , and a great conflagration quickly spread on the slopes of the mountains . The heat whirled the air , a great quivering rose in the Lebanon valley , a wind stirred over the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nablus Gate . One of its blades struck the vali 's - Hare and broke her neck . The stunned holy man whose horizons were narrowed by his piety , and who did n't quite understand cause and effect , extricated himself from under the carcass and poured out his wrath on the closest sinner  --  he waved his hand and cursed the windmill : may its blades dry up and never move again . The blades stopped as if struck by thunder ; they were still all that night , and at dawn the sobbing miller saddled his donkey , tied two mules loaded with tributes to it , and rode to Hebron to appease the holy man and ask him to lift the evil decree . But when he reached Hebron , he found that the vali had returned to his own town , made his will , and was lying with his forefathers . An old man he was , and because of the intense effort of the curse , the veins of his heart burst , and he died . The windmill of Nablus Gate , incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writings of many travelers , including Gustave Flaubert , who called it " a lovely delight at the edge of that heap of rot called Jerusalem . " To those who are amazed at the style , we shall only say that in Flaubert 's relations with Jerusalem there is indeed something obscene . The distinguished writer even took pains to state that he broke wind from his behind the moment he entered the city for the first time , and that she , with her exquisite sense of justice , gave him in return a fine ( lose of syphilis through that same behind ; and these things are also known , and the delicate soul will understand them well even without going into detail . The mill stood still , but not time . Seven bad years came and went . There was a war , hunger and disease ruled the city , its masters changed , many of its sons left and did n't return , and all the while , the mill was embalmed in its curse , immortalizing the moment of its death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on winter days to see that the blades did n't move , even in storms that made roofs fly off and bells ring . On the advice of the Greek Patriarch , the miller decided to dismantle the windmill , invert its stones , and build it anew But as he was figuring out his calculations and preparing his steps , an Italian named Salvatore Benin-  | tendi came to Jerusalem , a film projectionist from Alexandria who was wandering all over the Levant in camel caravans and on steam engines . The Italian toted boxes of silent films around with hini , as well as an enormouss projector whose system of gears could be connected to the pump in the citrus groves , the water-wheel of a well , Circassian dancers , the ox working an oil press , or any other Oriental machinery that rotated . Jerusalem , wit II her stylized lies , her infinite stone memory , and her touching attempts to terrify her visitors , captured his heart . Salvatore Benintendi investigated , asked around , and quickly rented the arrested windmill . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred : a terrible screech was heard , and the blades of the mill began moving again . Salvatore Benintendi was n't only a lover of silent film , he was also a pious Catholic , and by virtue of these two qualities , he loved miracles and believed in them . To the joy of the audience , the Greek miller allowed him to continue his shows , because he was a wise man and understood that , even if the strange projectionist belonged to the wrong church , without him and his movies , the mill would come to a stop again . In an amazing display of fraternity , the heads of all the millets in the city imposed bans and prohibitions on viewing , the blades of the windmill set up a terrifying racket , clouds of ground flour whitened the faces of actors and spectators  --  nevertheless , the audience flocked to the cinema . The most persistent and enthusiastic of them all was a Jewish lad named Elijah Salomo , a youth of the Monastir community . He was incorrigibly curious , devoted to excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known as an astronomer , philosopher , linguist , and mathematician . But he was chiefly famous as the first Jerusalemite to ride in an automobile . This matter demands some specification , for in a city that has seen all kinds of death , foolishness , miracles , and pain , it is hard to create wonders ; but the first automobile surprised even her . It was a daring little Napier that was unloaded from a ship at the foot of the Carmel and galloped across the country confounding the eyes , ears , and noses of the inhabitants with the wild , mad world of internal combustion . Its polished mahagony trim , the heartbeats rising from its body , the lack of nuisances  --  no grousing carters , no tangled reins , no daydreaming horses  --  delighted everyone who saw it . On a lovely summer day it reached Jerusalem , burning the strange frankincense of gasoline and caoutchouc , leather and hot metal . The driver , an American of about fifty , a tall man with a moustache , adorned with an equestrian coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at Nablus Gate , not far from the windmill . He took off his dust goggles  | and driving gloves , mixed fearlessly with the gathering crowd , shook hands and said , " Mister and Misses Charles Glidden of Boston . " Missus Charles Glidden , a smiling redhead , increased the amazement . She also shook hands , and she also wore riding boots . Her freckles and eyes gleamed , a silk scarf around her neck fluttered in the wind , and her tweed trousers proved to the agitated audience that her legs were attached to one another . Until that time , the religious leaders had succeeded for generations in convincing every man in the city that his wife was the only woman in the world whose legs met , so that he would n't lust after the junction of any other woman 's legs . They made up lies , issued threats , and sewed dresses that blocked the light and the truth . And here came the American , his wife , her trousers , and their automobile , and stood the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy at that time , but he was already clever enough to regret that Missus Glidden had come to Jerusalem before he became a man . That night he could n't fall asleep , and after midnight , he slipped out of his house and went back to Nablus Gate . The crowd had dispersed , only a few onlookers were still standing in the distance , and two guards assigned by the American consul were walking around the automobile . In the misty dead of night the child crept into the trunk and closed the top over him . The next day , when the Gliddens went to take a dip in the Jordan , they heard a muffled cough from the wrong end of the automobile . They stopped and discovered the child , asphyxiated by the exhaust fumes , expiring with admiration and heat . They immediately took him out into the air , gave him food and drink ; and in the evening they brought him back to Jerusalem , sitting in the lap of Missus Glidden 's trousers  --  safe and sound , in love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night either , and the next morning he rushed to Nablus Gate and saw that the couple had disappeared , leaving behind only tire tracks in the dust and a faint aroma of perfume and combustion . Elijah never saw the Napier or Missus Glidden again , except in his dreams . Then , as they are wont to do , the dreams split into regrets , hopes , and memories , and Elijah Salomo was once again steeped in study , observation , and cogitation , and after Salvatore Benintendi came from Alexandria  --  also in silent movies . He quickly made friends with the projectionist , learned Italian from him , and assisted him in his work for free , without any money . He swept the flour and the spittle off the floor , sold tickets , and rewound films . This friendship raised a number of eyebrows among the Monastirials ,  | for Salvatore Benitendi was suspected of loving then . and those suspicions . How ' , like all suspicions that have ever been raised in Jerusalem , were true . Somebody even heard Benintendi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care if they talk about me as long as they talk behind my back . " But Elijah was n't worried , because he knew that his friend was a homosexual of the Platonic variety , and that any kind of physical contact  --  either with women , men , or animals  --  was repugnant to him . Like most Monastirials , Elijah Salomo was also graced with a talent for tinkering , and in time he perfected the monstrous apparatus of wooden wheels , shanks and straps that connected the projector to the millstone . The transmission had no coupling or flywheel , and so strong winds sometimes accelerated the plots of love films , while funny movies brought clouds and rain to the city . And that , too , of course , infuriated the believers . Elijah saw every film several times and quickly learned to read the lips of the silent actors . His grasp was so sharp and fine that he succeeded in reciting their speeches in total synchronization with the picture . Even in the worst storms , when the actors began running around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink on them , " in the words of Salomo Salomo , Elijah 's father  --  even then he did n't fall behind them , and by imitating the movements of their lips and the expressions on their faces , he also unwittingly acquired a perfect American accent . A few years later , when the first talking picture came to Jerusalem , the spectators set up a racket of howls and laments , demanding that the machine be silenced , and they all wailed that Elijah Salomo 's synchronization was better , and his voice was more dramatic and pleasing than the voices of the speaking actors , but Elijah himself was dead by then . The story will revolve around that , and here begin the details . The Monastirials traded in fabrics , olive oil , arak , and herring , and prayed in a synagogue that was the only wooden building in Jerusalem . Their forefathers were Romaniot Jews , a bold ancient race that came to Macedonia in Roman times . A thousand years later the redheaded Jews expelled from Hungary mixed with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wonderful sense of humor . Not many of the exiles from Spain who came to Monastir a hundred years later dared to marry them , because those girls were graced with sharp tongues and dazzling beauty , unlike the stupid , delicate gazelles lauded by the poets of Seville . But the few who did venture to do so did n't regret it . This union brought children into the world whose fame spread all over the Mediterranean . 186  | Elijah looked very much like Salomo Saloum , his father , for ; among the Monastirials the features of the father passed only to the oldest son , his firstborn while the rest of the children resembled their mother in body and you . Even today in Jerusalem you can still hear the expression " As alike as a Monastirial and his firstborn son . " And indeed , all the oldest sons were arked by insatiable curiosity , and afflicted with unfathomable boredom , II studied astronomy to understand the secrets of infinity , and all were endowed with perfect night vision . That vision had developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was passed from father to son not only ! Bough training but also through inheritance . In fact , every firstborn Monastirial resembled the man who was thought to be the father of the community , the great theoretician of infinity Issachar Modrukhi Monastiali of blessed memory , and they all looked like living memorials to him , or Ice attempts to resurrect him . Issachar Modrukhi Monastirali lived in the sixteenth century . He knew II the stars of the sky , and their orbits were as familiar to him as the back of his hand . In his childhood , he had discovered the formula for summing up an infinite geometric progression many years before it was formulated by Friedrich Gauss , but proving the formula bored him so much he decided to pigeonhole it , thus keeping the fame of the world away from himself and his city . Everyone admired him and honored his memory , but even he did n't succeed in settling the great controversy that tore the community of Monastir Jews apart , the controversy over the right way to that desired infinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute reduction is the right way , while the " magnifiers " preferred the way of enlargement . We ' nay state that this was the continuation of the Minoan controversy about the infinity of space versus the infinity of the point , which still echoes in debates of our own day about the creation of the universe . Even among the Monastirials , known for their sharp wit , Elijah Salomo was considered a genius . By the time he was four he could solve in his head any mathematical problem presented to him ; at the age of nine he could explain why the white and the yolk do n't get mixed up in the egg . At four-t een he recited the laws of Kepler and Baum and the tables of Mendeleyev and Brand , and at seventeen he began going bald because of the intense heat inside his skull . In logarithmic and numerological calculations , Elijah Salomo even triumphed over the twins Zerubabel and Nehemia Teitelbaum , who were nicknamed Zerubuzzel and Zebuzzabel in Jerusalem because everyone who stood next to them could here the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at slit ' and tell you the sutra of the letters in the sentence your mind even below von said It aloud , and they no longer talked to 0 another in words but only in numbers . They say that at Passover , IS when Zerubuzzel and Zebuzzabel sat at their father 's seder , an awful quarrel erupted between them right after the second cup of wine , when Zebuzzabel bel suddenly stopped humming , looked at Nehetuia 's wife , and said " 2652 . " Nehemia flushed with offense , left the seder in a rage , and did n't talk to his brother for four years , until Zerubabel knelt before hint at t heir father 's funeral and , with a tear-stained face , whispered , " 6467 . " And Nehemia raised his brother up , pressed him hard to his heart , and forgave him with " 575 , " which adds up to " we be brethren . " The Kortijo de dos Puertas , the courtyard where the Salomo family lived , was also inhabited by a widow named Bulisa Ashkenazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a child , Elijah Saloum was crossing the courtyard on his way to the street , and gave her a sliver of blur glass through which to look at the world . He gave her the glass casually and did n't pay any attention to her afterward , just as he did n't pay any attention to any woman except two : Missus Glidden on earth and Aurora itt heaven . But Miriam loved him ever since with the sharp , hot love of children , and whenever she looked at the blue world he had bestowed on her , her heart would flutter and her knees would grow weak . She grew up into a quiet , good maiden , whose black hair sparkled with a deep blue gleam , and whose chest was flat as a hoard . All the girls her age had already puffed up and become convex , and they mocked her with the nickname Wailing Wall . Her breasts waited in her rib cage like the pair of white ravens in the famous Turkish adage , the white ravens that will never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulisa Ashkenazi 's prayers nor the Hebron amulets nor the Saint Jacob ointment of the old Armenian women did any good . Then , when Miriam was sixteen years and seven months old , she woke up in the middle of the night with a pain she could n't describe or compare with any other pain  --  not a stomach ache or melancholy or dolor de kabesa , or a dream of love , or anything that had ever happened to her before . For a few moments she lay excited , her eyes wide open , but not scared , because the strange pain lodged in parts she had never had before , and so she decided that the pain did n't belong to her but had gotten lost , the kind of pain that has departed the bodies of dead men and are seeking new hosts . Years later , on nights when she felt the phantom pains sawing the  | mory of her right breast , she would recall the pain of that night . But n , when she suddenly woke up , she only smiled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and in the morning she saw that this e the breasts she dramed about every night had n't disappeared when woke up . " Dos miraculos . The right one of soft porcelain and the left one of hard k , " reported Bulisa Ashkenazi to the astounded neighbor women , and y hurried off to Hamam-el-Ayn , where the bath attendant let them peep at the pair of miracles Miriam 's body displayed ; and as they left , they ook and turned green with their envy and her beauty . One of those women was the wife of the matchmaker Shaltiel , who pealed at Bulisa Ashkenazi 's house the very next day , and told her he had ctt the liberty of pondering the unique case of Miriam and wished to pose a " match speziale . " Bulisa Ashkenazi pretended not to hear , and brought cold water to the bk. , along with roasted almonds , quince jam , and coffee cups . " Thur daughter requires somebody special , " said Shaltiel , who did n't forget to praise the refreshments either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already heard about your daughter , " said the matchmaker , wiping his lips on a white cloth napkin he pulled out of his coat pocket . " What did you hear ? " asked Bulisa Ashkenazi , with a cleverly acted suspicion . " Never mind , " said the matchmaker , " but what I did hear was enough . Pin her we need one of the Monastirials . " Despite the gravity of the matter , a smile spread over Bulisa Ashke-nazi 's face . Conjectures and legends about the conjugal life of the Monastirials were rife . The qualities that made them fit for a life of observation and contemplation  --  that is , curiosity , wisdom , a methodical mind , and patience  --  also made them splendid lovers , but their lust for knowledge and research was stronger than the lust of the flesh , not to mention drives like hunger and thirst , which dropped into third and fourth place . Which was why they remained thin as children and slept with their wives only on cloudy nights . Even today in Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like a Monastirial woman who returned from the mikve and found her husband looking at the stars . " The Monastirial women did indeed hate the summer because its days burned the skin of their white faces and its nights , sprinkled with the seductive winks of the stars , took their husbands away from them ; and it 's a  | known fact that in 1911 flies ' did n't give birth to a single child because Halley 's Comet had appeared ii- the skies of Jerusalem the year before and , 11I the Monasterial amen were busy . " For instance , " said Shaltiel the matchmaker , " for instance , a fellow you know , for instance , Elijah Salomo . " " For instance , what about him ? " " Elijah Salomo has a great many important things it- his head . Silent movies , automobiles , calculations , sunrises , languages , numerology ? t h e wisdom of King Solomon . Your daughter would n't do Elijah any harm . " Bulisa Ashkenazi was happy about the matchmaker 's proposal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened to point out that Elijah was prematurely bald . Shaltiel , bald himself , smiled as if he had n't heard t he remark , and quickly mentioned the affluence of the father of the intended bridegroom , the micrographer Salomo Salomo , one of the best-known Monasterials in the city . Salomo Salomo was an expert in the miniaturization of holy scriptures , and sold Christians the Epistles of Paul to the Corinthians written on seashells , Moslems the seventeenth surah on harness buttons , and Jews the Blessings of Dawn on fifteen grains of wheat .

Then he plucked a thin hair from the neck of the boy dozing in front of him , inserted it in a slit in the end of his writing quill , stuck out his tongue , and wrote Genesis 32:3-7 on his fingernail . This feat provoked great excitement in the Talmud Torah and in the courtyards of the quarter , and came to an evil and bitter end . The Mutasaref 's deputy , a vile , cruel Turk , an admirer of miniatures and a dwarf himself , heard that same day of " the little Monastirial 's fingernail , " sent for him , and after a brief examination ordered the nail sent to the museum
