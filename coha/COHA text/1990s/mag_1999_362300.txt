Sports stars do n't usually metamorphose during their careers . They may add a hook shot or throw more curves when the heater loses steam , but they do n't start arriving for work in fundamentally different guises . The many faces of Michael Jordan or Mark McGwire ? Not really . <P> And then there 's Andre Agassi . " I am constantly changing , " he says in what is , for him , a rare understatement . <P> The completely revamped , 1999-model Agassi motors into this week 's U.S. Open in New York City with the top down , the engine bulked up , and the passenger seat empty , Mrs. Agassi  --  a.k.a . Brooke Shields  --  having flown the coupe . Now ranked second in the world , the newly single Agassi has singlehandedly rejuvenated both his own sputtering career and men 's tennis in general . So winning the Open title in rowdy Flushing Meadows would be fitting . To do so , though , he 'll have to get by the top gun , Pete Sampras , who has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning everything in sight . Andre and Pete . Tennis is back . <P> When first we glimpsed Agassi just over a decade ago , he was a skinny teenager with an omigosh attitude . He was a teen heartthrob , a proto-Leo with a roaring forehand and a leonine mane ( hair , yes , Andre once had hair , streaked with fancy colors ) . A top-ranked player before he was 20 , he won the big one , Wimbledon , at 22 in ' 92 . A baseliner winning on a banger 's surface , grass . He could do it all . <P> Then , in his second stage , he could n't . Even while he was making serious hay as Nike 's and Canon 's poster boy  --  " Image Is Everything "  --  he was hangin ' with Barbra Streisand ( ! ) , asking Las Vegas to name streets after him , scarfing doughnuts and sagging on court like a sprung net . He dropped to No. 25 in the world and looked to be one kaput wunderkind . <P> What we realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are reinventions . In 1994 he reappeared as the Zen Master . Refreshed by the analyst 's couch and the preachments of coach Brad Gilbert , Agassi drifted through the U.S. Open draw , unseeded and unheeded , until he was the only one standing  --  a focused player on the court , a spouter of self-improvement blather off it . Hey , it was Deepak/Oprah ' 90s . <P> Re-emboldened , he embellished his persona package , at times a bandannaed pirate , at times the Punisher , who displayed a boorish attitude along with an admirably vicious game . He won another Grand Slam event , the 1995 Australian Open , and was cruising along as a bad-boy Numero Uno until he was again knocked into Kingdom Comeback by Sampras , who had more tools than a Swiss Army knife . Sampras administered a straight-set thrashing in the U.S. Open finals that cracked Agassi 's karma , causing him to question whether tennis was the be-all and end-all . <P> When a tennis pro is looking for something to take his mind off tennis , calling Shields every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swooned again , eventually bottoming out in 1997 at a world ranking of 141 . " I made a distinct choice for my life , and I do n't regret that at all , " Agassi says . " I 'm responsible for what I did  --  not Brooke . "
