Section : Computers/Communications <p> Put aside any notion that big computers are passe and all the world 's computing can be done on a few cheap chips . Image handling is a resource hog , and images , not words and numbers , are the future of a business that is on the threshold of new growth . <p> THE DETECTIVES were stumped . Three years of expensive investigation and they did n't have a suspect in the July 1987 murder of a former prosecutor for New Jersey 's Mercer County . The best clue was a fingerprint found on a water glass in the victim 's home . <p> Simply have the detectives search the fingerprint files , right ? Wrong . That happens only in the movies . The New Jersey police had a million prints on file , and searching them would have taken 167 experts working for a year . The trail was getting cold last summer when , as a last resort , a computer was put on the case . An IBM RT-115 workstation , attached to 100 billion characters of encoded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to do and what computers of a few years ago could n't do : compare images for similarity , millions of them . Case solved : A match was found with the prints of a convict serving time for another crime . And , according to trial testimony later , when the police descended upon him he blurted out a confession : " Do you know how long this has been on my mind ? Three years .... That glass . I knew I left fingerprints on that glass . " <p> The harnessing of computers to image handling is taking place in a dazzling array of applications . American Express offices in Phoenix and Fort Lauderdale scan up to 3 million charge card slips a day , sending them into a made-to-order imaging system assembled by a TRW subsidiary . The slips are shredded and buried ; pictures of what was on them go through a fiber-optic line between Fort Lauderdale and Phoenix . The computer retains not mere letter and number data but compressed pictures of the slips , complete with signatures . The digitized images are reconstructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly bills . <p> Or consider the enormous pile of blueprints and safety documentation for a new airliner . ( How big ? " Do you want that answer in pages or tons ? It probably weighs more than the plane , " jokes Boeing spokesman Thomas Cole . ) Boeing has converted this information into images inside a Tandem CLX minicomputer , not so much because it wants to save paper , but because there is simply no faster way to get at the information . On a computer , the pages can be sorted , searched and cross-referenced in a way that hard copy can not be . <p> Digital Equipment Corp . is demonstrating a prototype of a system that retrieves X-ray and other images from a databank , displays them , rotates them on an operating room monitor and accepts spoken annotations from a surgeon with a scalpel in his hand . What 's wrong with hard copy ? A surgeon or nurse would have to dirty his hands to use it . <p> Submarines use imaging systems . Although details are classified , it is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of three-dimensional maps , constructed digitally by computer from sonar pulses and displayed to the skipper . <p> Gene Feldman , an oceanographer at NASA 'S Goddard Space Flight Center , tackled a warehouseful of magnetic tapes , 9.8,000 of them , recording 71/2 years of satellite data on the earth 's oceans . With the help of scientists at the University of Miami , Feldman converted this jumble of numbers into a visual database of biological information ( see p. 264 ) , stored on Sony laser disks . " We turned a warehouse into two file cabinets , " says Feldman . <p> " Image processing is the processing of the future , " declares Francois Paul Briand , chief executive of N.A. Morpho Systems Inc. , designer of the fingerprint system used by the New Jersey police . " Images are much more complex than words or numbers , and that alone is the reason we did n't get to them until very recently . We needed the hardware to arrive . And it has . " <p> Forget , therefore , what you 've read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing , the need for computing power makes a giant leap . Image processing is an enormous power hog , because pictures contain such a wealth of information . In a computer 's memory , a picture paints not a thousand words but more like a million . And so image processing demands more memory , larger disks and higher horsepower to efficiently store , retrieve , route , process and analyze the information . These processing demands will keep many an IBM , DEC and Sony busy for years to come . <p> The computer industry , suffering from an excess of capacity , badly needs this new world of imaging . The industry is suffering because it has been all too successful in improving its products . Today a $15,000 personal computer based on Intel 's 486 microprocessor is 10 times as powerful as the 370-168 IBM mainframe that cost $3 million 15 years ago . If the tasks to be done by computers remained the same , this trend would be the death of large computer companies . The tasks , though , are expanding as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image processing system ? Every doctor , nurse , teacher , engineer or car mechanic is a potential customer , as binary-encoded images replace hospital charts , teaching aids , blueprints and shop manuals . Someday , nearly every office worker might be connected to or near one . That 's a market of millions of terminals . <p> There is a lot of revenue to be carved up . Wang Laboratories , a $2.5 billion computer company that has staked its future on image handling systems , defines as typical a $600,000 price tag for hardware and software for a 40-user system . To this cost add another 25% to 50% for consulting , assembly , custom programming and training costs . So you are spending about $1 million to bring imaging into a medium-size department : $25,000 per person . Digital Equipment Corp . ' s Claude Thomas , vice president of the insurance business group , says DEC imaging systems can range up to $50 million in cost . One unnamed DEC customer may spend as much as $300 million on a new system that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at IDC/Avante Technology , a Framingham , Mass. market research firm , predicts that the imaging market will reach $35 billion before the decade is out . <p> If the computer industry is slowing down these days , the slowdown is only temporary . <p> Yes , hardware prices will continue to drop , but customers will demand more powerful hardware . When the world 's businesses and governments are sated with still images they will come back for more : full-motion images . Such a shift would multiply the amount of data in a file by a factor of 100 to 10,000 . When today 's $100,000 computers are replaced with tomorrow 's $10,000 computers , tomorrow 's bigger image files will create a demand for computers that run ten times as fast , continually reviving the fortunes of companies that make big computers . Ingenious compression schemes shrink the size of picture files . But , the greater the compression , the more computation must be done to store and retrieve the picture . In short , if you want to handle picture data , there 's no getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also significant is the fact that image systems are complex , custom-designed solutions that demand the integration of computers , peripherals , communication lines and software of many different brands . At such skills the IBMS , DECS and Hewlett-Packards of the world excel ; desktop clones from Taiwan are not a threat , no matter how fast they run . Wall Street 's obsession with the way personal computers encroach on much costlier DEC and IBM products , and its conclusion that computer making has become just another cyclical capital goods industry , are overdone . Computers will remain a growth industry well into the 21st century . <p> " This is arguably the biggest opportunity facing the computer industry , " says David Liddell , manager of marketing plans for IBM Image Solutions . Liddell 's company in particular . Market analyst Scott McCready says that IBM could be getting 30% of its revenues from imaging technology by 2000 . <p> The futurists who talked about the paperless office were wrong . Computers have produced more paper , not less : more brochures , more insurance forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chits . But this pile of paper gives all the more impetus to paperless storage systems at a later stage of a document 's life . At the U.S. Patent &; Trademark Office , searches would be next to impossible without an image database wired into two mainframes from Hitachi 's National Advanced Systems . Car mechanics are buried in shop manuals . Solution , from Hewlett-Packard and OWL International , a software producer : put the books inside a computer . When Los Angeles County hired the law firm of Parker , Milliken , Clark , O'Hara &; Samuelian to defend it against a litigation brought by Malibu homeowners whose houses were wiped out by mud slides , the lawyers hired TechLaw Systems in Chantilly , Va . to scan 325,000 pages of depositions , deeds , engineering reports and court documents into an imaging system . TechLaw says the system saved the county millions of dollars in damage settlements . The firm estimates it would have taken 100 paralegals working day and night for four months to process the paperwork . <p> The visionaries who predicted a checkless society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks around in their wallets and mail them in to pay bills . But we could get something pretty close to checkless back offices . Banks are beginning to run checks through image processing systems , taming a torrent of 55 billion checks a year with scanners and laser disks . The systems are intelligent enough to focus on the amount , and convert the handwriting to a computer-readable format at rates of up to 2,400 checks per minute . The images of the processed checks can then be stored on optical disks and routed over networks to clearinghouses and branch offices . The driving force behind these evolving technologies is check float . No more time wasted shipping checks by airplane . Images of the checks will be instantaneously transmitted by optical fiber ; checks will clear a day faster , and some players ' interest costs will be lower . W. Leighton Carmichael , director of document and check image systems at IBM , predicts : " Someday we 'll have a shredder at the end of the sorter . Checks will be processed and then go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says John Rome , president of Infinite Images , another Chantilly , Va . imaging firm . A filing cabinet in a Manhattan office building contains 10,000 pieces of paper and costs its owner $1,000 a year in rent at $50 a square foot ) , or 10 cents a page . Now suppose that getting at this information means employing one file clerk ( at $20,000 a year ) to handle every ten file cabinets ( containing 100,000 documents ) . There 's another 20 cents a page per year . What if these are very sensitive documents ? They have to be guarded , or housed in a special room , or duplicated and stored in another place . What if several people want to see the same piece of paper at the same time ? Photocopying costs can add up . Then : How much will it cost to replace the piece of paper if you lose it ? <p> The solution is to store the documents as computer images . ITT 's Hartford Group did just that with its auto insurance files , using a system from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives replace the file folder that contained an accident report , a claims adjuster 's scribblings , signed letters and a photo of a dented car . Thus , an adjuster and his supervisor can simultaneously have the file before them . <p> Great Western Bank 's real estate division has converted 50 million microfilmed mortgage documents into a FileNet imaging system , all the documents instantly available to customer service and mortgage processing personnel . Northwest Airlines has a collection of ticket receipts 7 feet tall and covering an area the size of a basketball court . Not wanting to add to the pile , it is putting new ticket receipts  --  at a rate of 300,000 a day  --  onto laser disks . Eventually , labor savings could be significant . The old system kept 590 clerks busy . <p> Like Northwest 's ticket filing operation , most business applications of image handling equipment do not call on the computer to compare images or make judgments about what an image represents ; they are simply devices for compressed storage . What comes next is image analysis , which requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is key to certain image systems used by scientists , the military and the police . As designers gradually give computers the power to recognize and interpret images , these applications will spread to the business world . <p> The fingerprint comparison that nailed the murder suspect in New Jersey is a very specialized case of image comparison , one much less demanding than , say , facial recognition . ( Yes , recognizing a familiar face , so easy for a baby , would tax today 's supercomputers . ) Why are prints simpler ? Their salient features can be described mechanically , in terms of where a line forks into two , ends or curves around ( see caption , p. 258 ) . The N.A. Morpho system used by police departments takes advantage of the relative simplicity of fingerprint images to search large databases for possible matches quickly . ( Even the comparatively creaky IBM RT-115 workstation was able to find the murder suspect in half an hour . ) N.A. Morpho based its technology on software and hardware originally developed in France to classify the trajectories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition is only the beginning . Weapons designers would dearly love to have missiles that can identify targets , and are pouring money into pattern recognition . One such system is built by Inframetrics , a North Billerica , Mass. infrared imaging company . Inframetrics ' targeting systems can identify an enemy tank or jet fighter by the characteristics of its heat signature . By comparing a digital representation of that signature to an onboard database of other heat images , the system helps a fighter pilot or antiaircraft launcher make the split-second decision of whether an object is friend or foe . Not long ago , reconnaissance photographs were analyzed by humans trained to detect target features . Today , in the age of spy satellites whose telescopes have a resolution as fine as 1 square meter , computer analysis is the only way to deal with the volume of data . <p> Police departments are already using computerized image manipulation to help crime victims reconstruct the faces of criminals . The search for a suspect is then accelerated with a database of mug shots . But comparison of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experimental stage . Such a system , although ominous in its implications for personal privacy , would be quite a weapon in crime prevention . It is not hard to imagine an image system of vintage 1995 or 2000 capable of reading every face that passes by an airport detector and comparing it with a database of suspected terrorists . Next , perhaps , if the public does not find such intrusions too Orwellian : videocameras at every teller 's window or shop counter , to flag suspected check forgers and charge-card fraud artists . <p> Work is already under way at XImage , in San Jose , Calif. , to develop a system that can match images to images . The problem , according to Executive Vice President James Gossett , is that two faces have to be shot from the same distance and angle to be recognized as the same by a computer ( a baby does n't have that hang-up )  --  to say nothing of the subtleties of facial expressions . Another problem : Current software approaches to image comparison demand , in this situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercomputer 's . That 's forbidding , but do n't forget that today 's microprocessors have the power of mainframes of a decade ago . It also appears that radically different logical approaches to the problem may result in a breakthrough . So-called neural network logic , very different from the methodical and precise logic of conventional computer programs , has enabled a scientist at the University of California at Davis to train a computer to recognize when a spot of blood cells have clumped together ( FORBES , Nov. 12 ) . <p> For now , privately owned XImage is getting its revenues from a less ambitious system that helps the police match mug shots . The firm 's Forcefield 2 system combines Sony optical disks , a DEC Micro Vax and Sun Sparc workstations in an image handling system . Already installed in San lose and Orlando , the system allows an arresting officer to take a mug shot of a suspect and store it digitally , tagging the file with textual descriptions of the image . So instead of using a composite artist to build a cartoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operator sitting at the keyboard of the system what the suspect looked like , and have stored images that most closely match that description appear on the screen . <p> Gossett says one Orange County , Fla. rapist has been tried and convicted after being fingered by a Forcefield system in San Jose . XImage is now working on a system to transmit images to squad cars . <p> Roger Sullivan is president of the Association for Information &; Image Management and vice president at the Norwell , Mass. market research firm ms CAP International . He sums up the outlook for image processing : " This technology and the capabilities that it brings to an organization will have the same pervasive impact on society that personal computing had in the 1980s , but on a much grander scale . " He 's almost certainly right . <p> Little of this will translate into better sales and earnings for the big computer firms over the next few quarters , but it will transform their futures and give laggards like Wang a second chance . The computer industry is not mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( COLOR ) : Sample crime-scene print ( middle ) is compared with file print ( far right ) in N.A. Morpho computerized search system .
