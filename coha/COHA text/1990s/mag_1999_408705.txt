TO MY DEAR FRIENDS of the Catholic Taliban : Let me save you time and effort . Do n't stop fortifying your compounds in Idaho against the millennial. anti-Catholic coup planned by Hillary Clinton and Jerry Springer . Do n't take the time to compose a new letter ; just clip and mail the following paragraphs . " Dear Editor : We the undersigned are shocked and outraged that a so-called Catholic magazine like America would publish a balanced treatment of Dogma . We would not waste our time seeing this blasphemous trash ourselves , but we know from the look of an ad in the newspaper and from statements issued by our movement 's cell-leaders , who make outrage their full-time occupation , that this film makes a mockery of the most sacred beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church . It is part of the concerted effort of the liberal media to destroy any remaining sense of decency in America . Photograph Ben Affleck and Matt Damon star in Kevin Smith 's controversial new movie Dogma . // " Seeing the film would not change our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist except in the warped minds of East Coast pseudo-intellectuals . The Holy Catholic Church is beyond any criticism , since all criticism is malicious . The distinction between externals and core beliefs is spurious . Making a joke out of blessing golf clubs is just as vicious as attacking the Trinity . There is nothing finny about religion , especially in the Roman Catholic Church . Besides , in any circumstances entertainment has no rights . Give us a message film , like " Song of Bernadette , " or give us silence . " If we had a subscription to America we would cancel it . If we gave anything to the America Associates , we would stop . Your once-Catholic publication should be ashamed . Apologize to your readers . Get a truly Catholic reviewer and fire Richard A. Burke immediately . " ( ne inaccurate rendering of the name authenticates the source . ) This suggested form letter simply conflates opinions gathered from my past experience : " The Exorcist " ( 1974 ) , " Jesus Christ Superstar " ( 1973 ) , " Nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1985 ) , " The Last Temptation of Christ " ( 1988 ) , " Priest " ( 1994 ) , and perhaps several others now happily forgotten . These tempests in the holy water font seem to roll around predictably every few years , like " Rocky " sequels . Some " Catholic " fringe group , in reality anything but catholic , passes itself off as representative of the church , brands a film " offensive " and " controversial , " goes to the press , threatens boycott , makes distributors nervous and thus gives the film a bit of invaluable publicity before it sinks into the back shelves of Blockbuster video stores . - DOGMA-  MAY BE UNIQUE , Compared with its controversial ancestors . Kevin Smith , its director and screenwriter , claims to be a practicing Catholic , and why should we doubt him ? He has created a profoundly spiritual film , but he does not speak the church language of those of us who have absorbed several decades of dull , unimaginative sermons and ponderous ecclesiastical abstractions . " Dogma " takes aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suffocating face of religion as the norm . Such a film as this has to be viewed across the generational abyss . Smith clearly envisions an audience with purple and green streaks in its hair . The kid who sold me a ticket had more metal in her left nostril than I had in the wristband of my Timex . She could rent herself out as an antenna for NASA . To my horror , the wretched child gave me a " senior citizen " ticket without asking , but torn between vanity and greed , I kept silent and pocketed the extra singles . Without a ragged baseball hat and droopy pants , I felt shamefully underdressed for the show , and before the lights went down I had the sick feeling that I was probably the oldest person in the theater by 30 years . The film , which in fact has an " R " rating , should have a revised version of the NC-17 ( no codgers over 17 admitted ) . The main reason the film drew a rating as low as " R " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campuses and regard language as something sacred surely bridle at the realization that the F-word is second only to " like " in frequency counts for teen-talk , but that 's , like , a fact , not a moral or political statement . For most of them the word has lost its content almost entirely Equipped with little by way of language or theology , innocent of history and possessing an imagination honed on comic books and video games , how does a young person address questions of faith ? In Kevin Smith 's world the young searcher demolishes with a high degree of irreverence all the desiccating encrusrations of religion and tries to get down to the core . In this crazy world that adults have created , is there anything one can believe in ? With what words or images does one frame the inquiry ? Smith tries to invent his own , and for the most part he succeeds . Yes , the irreverence borders on blasphemy , but it might be more accurate to say that Kevin Smith replaces many of the tired symbols of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evocative . Christians are , for example , quite comfortable with the anthropomorphic imagery of Genesis , about God 's walking in the cool of the evening in the garden and resting after seeing that what he created was very good . Smith 's God , the singer Alanis Morissette , so enjoys her creation that she takes occasional furloughs from heaven , assumes a human form and plays Skee-Ball with children in boardwalk arcades . SMITH IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY satirist . Cardinal Glick the iconoclastic stand-up comic George Carlin , is cardinal archbishop of Red Bank , NJ . Aware of declining attendance , he hatches " Catholicism WOW , " a campaign to make religion more fun for young people . He replaces the crucifix ( too depressing ) with a statue of a winking , grinning , thumbs-up polychrome Jesus . Catholic guilt can be erased in an instant , if one gains a plenary indulgence merely by passing through the portals of his newly restored church . Glick is clearly a clown , but his antics point out what many young people see as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoniness of all those superannuated youth ministers- " Call me Father Bill " - who sugarcoat the hard facts of a life of faith while affecting an interest in rock music to help them " relate . " Kids see through it , like SaranWrap on leftovers . While Glick takes the heat for the foibles of the establishment , Jay ( Jason Mewes ) represents everything obnoxious about the stereotypical teenager . He natters on crudely and endlessly about sex . His shoulder-length hair and over-theears knit hat have clearly protected his brain from the intrusion of any concept that ca n't be expressed in , like , four letters . The core figure of this comic-book parable is Bethany , played by Linda Fiorentino , whose voice is so husky and sultry that she makes Kathleen Turner sound like Minnie Mouse . ( Women with voices deeper than mine intimidate me . ) Bethany lives alone after her divorce . She admits that she no longer believes , but out of habit remains a practicing Catholic , even tithing the salary she earns by working at an abortion clinic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke of linking a Catholic character to the hot-button topic of abortion , the irony makes an important theological point . In the process of regaining her faith , Bethany leaves the clinic , begins a pilgrim journey and eventually becomes an agent of life for the entire world . In a more solemn setting , her conversion would be hailed as edifying . One night the angel Metatron , played by the English actor Alan Rickman , appears to her and , speaking as the voice of God , informs her that she has been called for a special mission . He has had experience delivering such messages , and the cultivated accent adds a note of credibility to his divine communications . ( Americans remain flummoxed by English accents . ) Only gradually does Bethany realize that her calling involves a contest with two fallen angels , Loki and Bardeby ( Matt Damon and Ben Affleck ) , who have discovered a loophole in Catholic dogma that will enable them to get back into heaven . Loki , it seems , was the best avenging angel in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misunderstanding he and his sidekick were banished for all eternity to Wisconsin . They are understandably desperate . The final Armageddon will take place in New Jersey , a sure sign of their desperation . ON HER JOURNEY TO THE GARDEN STATE , aka. the Arlington Cemetery of the Mafia , Bethany meets a couple of prophets ( Mr. Mewes and the director , Kevin Smith ) , a fallen ex-Muse , Serendipity ( Salma Hayek ) , who supports herself by dancing in a strip club , and Rufus ( Chris Rock ) , the 13th Apostle , who is black and claims he was erased from the Gospel because the white guys wrote the books . This also explains why God is always referred to as " he . " Anyone who has enjoyed the beatific vision and has seen God in white tights and tutu knows that this is patently fAse . Hmmm . Rufus gives us all something to think about . In a film carefully designed to upset everyone except those with purple and green hair , who will think it 's , like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images . Loki occasionally reverts to his former line of work with the help of a huge nickel-plated pistol rather than a flaming sword , but the angelic avenging occurs off-camera . When he annihilates a boardroom full of television executives , he makes a good case for God 's restoring the role of annihilator-at-large . Serendipity 's dance is a modest affair , and the camera is far more interested in the moronic spectators drooling on the bar . The only sequence that is clearly offensive concerns a poop-monster ( this is not the term they use ) , who attacks the band of pilgrims in a bar in New Jersey . This gross-out scene provides the opportunity to show off a few special effects , but it adds nothing to the story and a wise editor should have buried it in the Jersey Meadowlands among the great disappeared dons of past altercations of the mob . For all its sophomoric offensiveness , " Dogma " is a film of ideas , more particularly of theological ideas , and that is always welcome . It 's not my cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youthful appearance . I wonder how I 'd look in purple and green hair . Maybe some silver wire in my nose . Hmmm . Richard A.
