I. INTRODUCTION <p> The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is charged with protecting the United States from those who pollute the land , air , and water for , among other reasons , economic gain. 1 Inherent in the EPA 's function is the obligation to enforce , through judicial or administrative action , the regulations2 which govern the amount of pollutants released into our nation 's environs . The ability to deter effectively pollution through burdensome civil penalties is based on simple financial considerations : it should be more cost efficient to comply with environmental regulations than it would be to pay fines for nomcompliance . The EPA 's enforcement policy relies on the assumption that appropriate civil penalties , at the very least , negate any economic benefit gained from non-compliance. 3 This assumption , however , appears flawed . Current civil penalties , when assessed , do not fully account for all of the economic gains made by illegal corporate activity because they omit considerations of increased market share. 4 This Article addresses the EPA 's civil penalty policy and proposes improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are advanced with the hope that the EPA , state and local environmental enforcement agencies , citizens ' groups , and corporate America all will embrace the suggested proposals . <p> Section II of this Article discusses the policies behind the EPA 's use of civil penalties as a means of deterring non-compliance with environmental regulations . Section III examines the methodologies used to determine the amount of civil penalties owed by a non-compliant source . Section IV offers a critique of the EPA 's current civil penalty assessment program . Section V recommends corrections to the assessment formula and offers suggestions as to how to reformulate penalty assessment methods so as to account for increased market share . Section V also provides an analysis of the penalty assessment proposal , specifically aimed at both citizens ' groups and corporate parties , that details the benefits of reformulating civil penalty criteria . II . THE GOALS OF THE EPA 's CIVIL PENALTY PROGRAM A. Background <p> Federal environmental statutes contain various enforcement tools including : . ( 1 ) notices of violation ; ( 2 ) administrative compliance orders ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) criminal sanctions ; ( 5 ) judicial penalties and injunctive relief ; and ( 6 ) citizen suit provisions. 6 Federal enforcement powers developed in the early 1970s when Congress became concerned that states were not enforcing environmental violations to the fullest extent. 7 This Congressional concern precipitated enactment of federal environmental statutes that contained enforcement measures which , among other things , gave the EPA the power to assess monetary penalties. 8 <p> Civil penalty provisions in federal environmental laws typically range from $5,000 to $25,000 per violation and may be assessed against persons , facilities , and " owners and operators " of facilities. 9 The EPA 's goals in measuring and assessing penalties are threefold . The EPA seeks to deter nomcompliance of government regulation ; 10 looks to provide an equitable regimen for actors in the regulated community ; 11 and desires to bring about the most expeditious resolution of environmental problems. 12 To further these goals , the EPA has formulated guidelines to use in implementing its penalty assessment program. 13 All enforcement actions taken , either through administrative or judicial avenues , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing guidelines. 14 B. Deterrence15 <p> First and foremost , the EPS 's civil penalty assessment program is designed to prevent environmental violations form occurring , and , if they occur , to prevent repetition of violations. 16 For penalties to be effective as deterrent measure , alleged violators must suffer repercussions in such a manner that violators find themselves disadvantaged economically as a direct result of noncompliance. 17 If this were not the case , those companies that had previously complied with the environmental regulations would face competitive disadvantages. 18 Thus , at the very least , the EPA should structure every civil penalty assessment in such a manner to negate all of the economic benefits that have accrued to companies during the period of their violations. 19 <p> In addition to the elimination of any economic advantage gained by violators , the deterrence goals require that additional penalties be assessed . If the EPA fails to assess these additional penalties , the deterrence factor is weakened . Recouping the economic benefit alone merely places violators in the same position as they were before they failed to comply with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that violators be left in a worse position than if they had spent time and money to comply with the environmental regulations in the first place . This policy encourages compliance in the regulated community . The regulated community realizes that non-compliance results in a loss of economic benefits and additional fines analogous to punitive damages . <p> The additional fines levied against violators reflect the seriousness of the offense. 21 When evaluating the seriousness of an offense the EPA will look at several factors : ( 1 ) the amount of pollutants discharged ; ( 2 ) the toxicity of the pollutants ; ( 3 ) the sensitivity of the environment in which pollutants were released ; ( 4 ) the length of time during which the violation occurred ; and ( 5 ) the size of the violations. 22 These " gravity " fines are consistent with congressional intent . Most environmental statutes contain provisions which factor into the penalty equation an amount that reflects the level of damage done to the environment . The Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , And Liability Act ( CERCLA ) , 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control Act ( Clean Water Act ) , 25 the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act ( EPCRA ) , 26 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) 27 all contain language that mandates an evaluation of the extent of environmental violations . Thus , the statutes require something further than a mere recoupment of the economic benefit gained through noncompliance. 28 The statutes mandate additional penalties to increase the likelihood that penalties will deter not only violating parties but also other members of the regulated community. 29 C. Establishment of a Level Economic Playing Field <p> The EPA 's civil penalty assessment program is also designed to promote an equitable system of regulation. 30 Under the current system of regulation , pollution control requirements are necessary for every similarly situated source in a regulated community. 31 Therefore , all sources are required to expend capital on mechanisms designed to conform to environmental regulations. 32 If sources fail to comply with applicable regulations , the EPA assesses fines. 33 The assessed fines are in addition to the capital expenditures needed to purchase and install the pollution control mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penalties should conform to a certain set of standards while remaining elastic enough to account for individual circumstances. 35 Consistency , uniformity , and flexibility in the application of the penalty assessment program , decrease the likelihood that the parties will challenge enforcement actions on grounds of arbitrariness and capriciousness. 36 The lack of rigidity in the penalty assessment program allows the EPA , upon a clear showing by violators , to take into account any mitigating factors. 37 <p> In addition to reducing an initial penalty assessment , mitigating factors may be used to increase a preliminary determination of the appropriate penalty amount . Once an " initial penalty target figure " is determined by the case development team , the EPA initiates formal settlement negotiations. 38 The target figure  --  the amount which the EPA initially feels it is obligated to recover  --  may later be adjusted to take into account any other relevant information that comes to light. 39 Consistent implementation of the penalty assessment program discourages protracted litigation. 40 This , in turn , promotes the third goal of the EPA 's penalty assessment program , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Swift Resolution of Environmental Problems <p> Finally , the EPA 's civil penalty assessment program is designed to prompt violators to conduct remedial efforts in the fastest possible manner. 41 To achieve this goal , the EPA undertakes two different , but related , types of actions . To encourage violator-initiated remedies , the EPA provides incentives for immediate compliance and disincentives for delayed compliance after the commission of a violation. 42 Incentives may take any form43 and may include a reduction in the gravity component of the penalty based upon the timeliness of the response to the EPA 's notice of violation. 44 Self-reporting , which ensures a more immediate environmental response , lowers violators ' penalty assessments. 45 Furthermore , the EPA will generally reduce penalties if violators undertake corrective actions before the institution of litigation or administrative actions by the EPA or the United States Attorney 's Office. 46 Disincentives include an adjustment of the initial penalty target figure upwards if violators engage in protracted settlement negotiations while violations continue. 47 The EPA also has a number of enforcement actions that the agency may undertake in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not limited to , administrative compliance offers , temporary restraining orders , and permanent injunctions . These tools , however , may not be as useful as , or may be more cumbersome than , the aforementioned economic incentives . <p> E. Calculating the Benefit Component to Achieve the Goals of the EPA 's Penalty Assessment Program <p> In order to give full effect to the goals of the penalty assessment program , the EPA devised a model for calculating and establishing civil penalties for the violation of environmental regulations. 49 The model 's specific and primary goal is to estimate the economic benefits gained through noncompliance of environmental regulations. 50 On a secondary level , the calculations , based on computer generated formulas , seek to ensure uniformity throughout different regions and different industries . Through the model , the EPA also seeks consistency in the enforcement of different environmental statutes. 51 III . CIVIL PENALTY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY A. Introduction to the BEN Model <p> The centerpiece of the EPA 's civil penalty assessment program prevents violators from benefitting financially as a result of their failure to comply with environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain achieved by violators ' non-compliance , the EPA utilizes a computer model53 that estimates economic benefits that have accrued to any violators during periods of violation . The computer model , commonly referred to as the BEN model , 64 provides a uniform quantitative analysis of environmental violations. 55 <p> The EPA adopted the BEN model because of the advantages that the model provides over other methods of civil penalty assessment. 56 For example , the BEN model does not require that EPA case development teams engage in financial research or numerical estimations. 57 Using the BEN model also allows violators to take active roles in the penalty assessment process by voluntarily submitting financial data and , thus , conserves the EPA 's resources. 58 As a result , the EPA 's time and resources are not wasted on repetitive calculations . In addition , because the BEN model uses standard variables , and because penalties determined by the BEN model are always relative to other penalties that are assessed , adjudicatory bodies are more likely to defer to the EPA 's assessment. 59 Standard variables also provide and maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula used by the BEN model allows violators to provide input into the penalty assessment process . Aside from the standard variables that are repeatedly used , violators provide financial information to input into the other variables used to determine liability. 61 Thus , to a certain extent , violators will help determine appropriate fines . A violators ' ability to influence the penalty assessment process also lends itself to judicial deference. 62 Violator participation eliminates a significant amount of time that would otherwise have been spent defending the accuracy and equity of civil penalty assessment calculations. 63 <p> The BEN model is used to calculate the accrual of economic benefits resulting from a delay in installing pollution control equipment or from a failure to utilize and support pollution control equipment already in place. 64 As a general rule , EPA personnel must use the BEN model when the " rule-of-thumb " method65 estimates penalties exceeding $10,000 . If the period of non-compliance is substantially lengthy , the rule-of-thumb method usually underestimates the economic benefit gained from non-compliance. 66 The BEN model should be used when environmental non-compliance involves postponed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used when the rule-of-thumb method produces penalties the accuracy of which is disputed by violators. 68 B. BEN Model Methodology <p> The BEN equation uses thirteen different variables to estimate the economic benefits of non-compliance with federal environmental laws. 69 Of the thirteen variables , eight can adopt standard value measures . The other five variables require the EPA to input70 information regarding the dates of non-compliance , the date of compliance , the penalty payment date , the dollar amount that the company would have expended had it provided for pollution control measures on time , and the delayed costs involving capital investments. 71 <p> The formula used in the BEN model is based upon certain assumptions about the lack of pollution control expenditures and the resultant delayed compliance . The BEN model originates from the premise that violators will eventually comply , or have finally complied with , any applicable regulations and will install necessary equipment to guarantee compliance. 72 The BEN model then assumes that violators should have installed , but did not , the same pieces of equipment in the year that they should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the delayed expenditure , and added to annual operating costs not expended , yielding the economic benefit . The BEN model 's formula determines the economic benefit by estimating the capital involved in buying equipment to bring violators into compliance with environmental regulations , estimating the amount of capital that would have been involved in buying equipment without delay , discounting the cash flows , subtracting the discounted values to arrive at the economic benefit , and then adjusting upwards the value of the economic benefit at the time the penalty is to be paid. 74 C. The BEN Model 's Failings <p> Industry attorneys criticize the BEN model on many fronts. 75 Not surprisingly , most of the criticisms of the BEN model claim that violators are being assessed too much. 76 In reality , the opposite is true . If the foundation of the EPA 's penalty assessment program were sound , and civil penalties deterred future violations , corporations would not continue to violate environmental regulations . Moreover , if the criticisms of the BEN model were accurate , and current civil assessments were inaccurate and overestimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should have been a dramatic decrease in environmental violations . If , after all , penalties deter violations , overestimated penalties would serve as a greater deterrent . Although the reasoning of this argument is sound , its application to present day environmental enforcement is misguided . The fact is , there has not been a decline in the number of environmental violations. 77 Furthermore , the lack of resources at the EPA provides companies with a comfort level that allows them to risk non-compliance with environmental regulations. 78 <p> Contrary to industry claims , the EPA 's current civil penalty assessment program falls short of a full accounting of the economic gains made by environmental non-compliance because the program fails to account for the market share gains made during periods of non-compliance. 79 As a result , corporations still find non-compliance with environmental regulations economically more efficient , offering a distinct advantage over their competitors who do comply. 80 The economic benefits of non-compliance are directly related to the BEN model 's failure to consider increases in market share that occur during periods of non-compliance. 81 Thus , disregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges the principles of the free market economy that ensure effective competition in the marketplace. 82 Effective competition requires , inter alia , a reasonable degree of parity in the marketplace. 83 IV . THE BEN MODEL 'S FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR INCREASED SALES AND PERMANENT MARKET SHARE GAINED DURING PERIODS OF ENVIRONMENTAL NON-COMPLIANCE <p> Without the promotion of parity in the marketplace through effective regulation , the regulated community can not compete on a level playing field . Yet , without an assessment of increased market share in the EPA 's civil penalty programs , companies that comply with environmental regulations and with the costs associated with the regulations , will face a competitive disadvantage . This provides a disincentive for companies to expend the initial capital costs involved in purchasing pollution control mechanisms . <p> The best comparative illustration of the ramifications of the current penalty policy is corporate America 's view of federal environmental regulation 's impact on international competitiveness . Most American companies feel that they face economic disadvantages vis-a-vis foreign competitors because of the stringent environmental regulations that pervade American industries. 84 Such stringent regulations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American companies are placed at the very same competitive disadvantage by fellow domestic companies that ignore federal environmental regulations . It makes no difference whether foreign companies enjoy competitive advantages because of lax environmental regulations by their home states or whether American companies enjoy competitive advantages because of their failure to comply with applicable federal environmental statutes  --  the same competitive disadvantages result . American companies should be just as concerned with competitive advantages gained by domestic competitors who evade federal environmental regulations  --  and thereby increase market share by avoiding capital costs  --  as they are with international competitors who are not as heavily regulated . A. The Benefits of non-Compliance <p> Without running afoul of antitrust law , companies seek to increase their market share as a means to achieve increased profits . A precursor to increased market share is the development of competitive advantages within the marketplace. 85 Competitive advantages take various forms . Examples of competitive advantages include increased production rates , the development of new technologies , and the construction of more efficient facilities. 88 There also exist , however , other , illegal means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include , among other things , price-fixing , collusion , and tying contracts. 87 All of these means are prohibited under United States antitrust law. 88 <p> In addition to antitrust violations , corporations in the market place may attempt to gain a competitive advantage over competitors by delaying compliance with , or ignoring altogether , laws that regulate the particular market . For example , if there are two companies  --  company A and company B  --  in the same market that are both regulated under the Clean Air Act , the decision to comply with all applicable regulations may have significant economic implications . If company A chooses to comply with a regulation requiring the installation of new pollution control equipment , at a cost of one million dollars , the company may have to raise its product 's price to help defray the cost of compliance . If company B chooses not to comply with the regulation , the company does not incur any compliance costs. 89 At the same time , as a direct result of the noncompliance , company B does not feel the same need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defray costs . Thus , company B , the non-compliant , is selling its product in the marketplace at a lower price. 90 Or , alternatively , company B can sell its product at the same price as its competitors for an even greater profit . Additionally , by ignoring federal violations regulations , company B can avoid delays caused by mandatory permitting and construction requirements. 91 Thus , company B gains a competitive advantage that will probably result in an increased share of the market . <p> The EPA 's current civil penalty assessment program fails to account for illegally gained competitive advantages that account for increased market share . The EPA hopes to recoup all of the economic benefits gained through delayed compliance . Unfortunately , the EPA falls short of its goals because companies that avoid initial capital costs associated with required pollution control mechanisms do not have to pass those costs on . As a result , noncompliants ' products may be , and probably are , sold at cheaper prices which allow noncompliants to increase the share of their markets . <p> Although companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applicable federal environmental regulations , as calculated by the BEN model , the increased profits from the increased market share , and/or additional sales , may alone support these penalties . Thus , to comply , companies will not have to raise prices to offset costs to the same extent as those who originally complied because the noncomplying company will possess greater financial resources to pay fines and install pollution control equipment-assuming the amount of profits that resulted from the increased market share are large enough to cover the costs of the fines . Therefore , delayed compliance may be profitable for companies in those instances where ill-gotten profits  --  associated with illegal market share gains  --  allow companies to pay their fines , comply with applicable regulations , and maintain their current prices . Without having to pass on the costs of compliance to customers , as other companies had to do when they initially installed the required pollution control mechanisms , companies that acted illegally may preserve their ill-gotten increased share of the market . B. Market Defined <p> In order to account accurately for violators ' economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's civil penalty assessment program . This incorporation first necessitates a definition of the market in which violators operate . Market share is defined as " the percentage of a market that is controlled by a firm . " 92 Although market share is an easy concept to understand , market share is difficult to measure . There always exist questions raised by marketplace competitors involved in antitrust litigation about the products that companies are producing. 98 Another frequently litigated issue concerns the precise nature of the market. 94 For example , if a company produces fountain pens , the question arises whether the market includes all fountain pens or all writing utensils . Thus , in order to assess increased market share one must first determine the relevant market . <p> Defining the relevant market is an integral component of antitrust litigation. 95 The development of antitrust regulation offers guidance as to how to best define the relevant market . One can not accurately account for the benefits of environmental noncompliance without first defining the parameters in which the noncompliance takes place. 96 In order to accurately describe a violator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product 's geographic distribution , the dimension of the product , 97 and the dimension of production facilities. 98 <p> After the market is adequately defined , an estimation of the company 's market share is determined. 99 Market share is indicative of a corporation 's competitiveness relative to other companies in the same market. 100 The most accurate way to determine a given market share is to analyze the corporation 's production levels. 101 To illustrate , assume there are two , and only two , companies in a given market  --  company A and company B. In 1990 , both companies produce and sell widgets at the same price and both have a fifty percent share of the market . In 1991 , Congress requires installation of more modern pollution control equipment at the companies ' widget facilities and mandates immediate compliance . Company A complies with the new regulation at a cost of $750,000 but company B chooses to ignore the regulation and continues to produce widgets without pollution control equipment . <p> As a result of incurring costs for compliance , company A is forced to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is passed along to consumers decreases company A 's sales . Company B , whose product is still at pre-regulation levels , sees sales increase . Their production levels rise and their share of the market increases to sixty percent . Company A drops its production levels and its market share drops to forty percent . <p> When the EPA finally brings an enforcement action against company B , the penalties will not account for the market share increase. 102 Assuming , arguendo , that the value of the increased market share is worth five million dollars to the company , the benefit calculation will only account for the delayed compliance time and the gravity component . Using the rule-of-thumb method , we can roughly estimate the penalty that the BEN model would generate. 103 The calculation would be five percent per year from the date of violation until the date of expected compliance. 104 If the date of compliance is five years from the date of violation the calculation would be twenty five percent ( five percent per year ) multiplied by $750,000 ( capital cost of compliance ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would bring the estimated penalty total to $287,500 , the penalty assessment does not fully account for company B 's true economic gain . If company B 's increased market share , due to noncompliance , is worth $5,000,000 , 105 a penalty assessment of $287,500 will hardly serve as a deterrent . Company B will not only be able to pay the fine and absorb the cost of compliance , but will still maintain substantial profit margin over company A. Furthermore , because of the increased market share valued at $5,000,000 company B can pay penalty assessment without having to raise its product 's price . Thus , company B will maintain its position , illegally established , in the market . The penalties will be offset by increased sales , increased profits , and after coming into compliance , company B will still find itself with sixty percent of the market . Even if costs are eventually levelled , and the price of company B 's product is roughly equivalent to the price of company A 's product , market share will not necessarily decrease . Loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , goodwill and the value of long-term contracts. 106 Thus , that delayed compliance , in this situation , is not financially injurious to company B. In fact , noncompliance appears to be profitable. 107 V. IMPLEMENTING ANALYSIS OF MARKET SHARE INTO THE EPA 's PENALTY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM A. Introduction <p> The above analysis demonstrates not only that the EPA 's penalty assessment program108 fails to recoup full economic benefits , but that it also , in many cases , falls in its chief policy goal to act as a deterrent against future violations. 109 To rectify this situation , the EPA 's penalty assessment program must penalize companies in relation to the true economic benefit gained from noncompliance with environmental regulations . Accounting for increased market share will be a step in the right direction . This new assessment methodology will not only serve as a greater deterrent but will also protect companies in the marketplace that comply with environmental regulations . Providing equitable enforcement will protect the integrity of the marketplace in the regulated community . Additionally , equitable enforcement will achieve a truly level playing field for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the business community , as well as environmental advocates , should urge the adoption of an increased market share component in the EPA 's civil penalty assessment program . <p> Some argue that such a method can not be implemented. 110 Criticisms , however , belie the fact that market share analysis is already frequently used in antitrust litigation. 111 Although it is beyond the scope of this Article to offer implementing legislation , skilled legislative drafters have a developed body of antitrust case law to use for guidance in formulating a particular market share analysis for environmental regulations. 112 B. The Creation of a Presumption That Increased Market Share is the Direct Result of non-Compliance <p> The EPA and other environmental enforcement agencies should presume , for the purpose of calculating the economic benefit component , that increased market share , since the inception of violations , resulted directly from non-compliance . Although the defendants could seek to minimize the economic benefit component figure by supplying financial data supportive of another conclusion , the figure 's accuracy could be determined , in part , by requesting the same information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gleaned from trade associations in the industry . Information could be demanded pursuant to various information gathering provisions located in environmental statutes. 113 Courts will generally defer to an agency 's findings if the agency 's position is supported by a well reasoned , clearly articulated , and thoroughly documented analysis. 114 Keeping this deference in mind , the EPA could add market share increase to the thirteen factors that the BEN model currently uses . Alleged violators would be allowed , as they are with other BEN factors , to supply information to aid in the EPA 's findings. 115 Again , any increased market share , measured from the beginning of the period of non-compliance , would be presumed to result from non-compliance . In order to quantify the percentage of increase and arrive at a dollar penalty amount , the same percentage of increased profits , adjusted for inflation , would be used . <p> This Article proposes a three step formula to account for the economic benefit derived from increased market share due to environmental noncompliance . First , to determine the value of the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual rate of return in a given year , or IMS = IP / ROR . To continue with the Company B example , 116 $5,000,000 ( value of increased market share ) = 500,000 / 10% ROR . To adequately utilize this formula , however , the amount of illegal profits must be determined . The illegal profit figure ( IP ) is the average117 profit made for five years prior to the beginning of the illegal conduct and the average profits for the years immediately preceding the return to compliance . The lower earlier profits are then subtracted from higher profits . The EPA , using provisions such as section 114 of the Clean Air Act , 118 would gather information from trade associations and other competitors in the market place in an attempt to verify the valuation of the illegal increase in market share . The illegal profits are then divided by the rate of return representative of the years during which the violations continued . <p> The second equation determines the value of the illegal benefit over the course of the violation , in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spent on required control equipment. 119 The calculation is the simple addition of any profits during the period of violations in excess of typical profits before the violations . In the Company B example , the illegal excessive profits averaged $500,000 a year for each of the five years of violation , creating a sum total of $2,500,000 . This illegal profit plus the illegal market share value of $5 million , equals a $7.5 million economic benefit gained from increased market share and increased sales . C. Corporate Suits to Supplement Citizens ' Suits <p> Many environmental statutes contain provisions for citizens ' suits. 120 Most citizens ' suits are filed from information gleaned under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) . 121 FOIA allows environmental groups to examine information submitted to the EPA in mandated filings. 122 To date , corporations have not actively engaged in litigation under FOIA 's disclosure provisions. 123 Incorporating increased market share into the EPA 's penalty assessment program , however , may change companies ' lack of activity over these provisions . Corporate America could find itself prosecuting more violators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is not complying with environmental regulations , the complying company would have a strong motivation to bring an action against the violator if the complying company believed that the penalty assessed would promote parity in the marketplace. 124 Companies that bring suit would have to obtain information under FOIA , much like citizens ' groups do now , to determine if competitors are in violation of any of the applicable federal environmental regulations . <p> As a public policy matter , this policy proposition has far reaching implications . The proposition serves three purposes : it increases the deterrent factor of the EPA 's civil penalty assessments ; it ensures a level playing field for those corporations who comply with environmental regulations ; and it potentially eases the EPA 's enforcement burden . These three factors should have widespread appeal . <p> The EPA should approve of the modified penalty assessment program because the regulated community would take a greater role in policing the competitors in its own markets . Corporate America should also support the modified penalty assessment program because the program would prevent illegal gains in the marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory compliance . These benefits would occur without any significant increase in government regulation . Not only is the marketplace left in much the same way that it exists now , but its very foundation is also strengthened ; equity in the regulated community may finally be achieved . Lastly , citizens ' groups will embrace the modified penalty assessment program because the inclusion of increased market share in penalty assessments will lead to greater penalties and more effective deterrence . VI . CONCLUSION <p> In order to effectuate its policy goals of deterrence , the EPA must address the inadequacies of its civil penalty assessment program . Although the EPA 's goals are admirable , they are frequently not realized . Too often companies , by delaying compliance , profit at the expense of the environment and other companies similarly situated in the same market that have complied with environmental regulations . <p> In order to protect the marketplace and the environment , the EPA must take steps to determine accurately the true benefits of non-compliance with federal environmental regulations . These steps should include an assessment of increased market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodology . Although such an assessment would place additional administrative burdens on the EPA , these burdens would be minimized by the fact that corporations would be gathering and supplying much of the information needed to assess market share . This process is no different from the processes used in determining other factors utilized in the BEN model . Additionally , administrative burdens would be offset , or even reduced , by the presumption discussed in Section V(B) and by increased enforcement by the regulated community . In the alternative , the burdens would be reduced by the additional monies collected vis-a-vis increased fines in those jurisdictions where penalties fund the enforcement agency . Even if there exist additional administrative burdens , they should never be allowed to prevent the protection of either the environment or the marketplace . <p> It is imperative , for the sake of environment and the regulated community , that the EPA reassess its civil penalty assessment program . The need to incorporate a civil penalty assessment program that accounts for increased market share is evidenced by companies ' continued disregard for environmental regulations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of environmental regulations .

Singh argues that the BEN model does not accurately reflect a situation in which there are differing circumstances that result in different compliance costs for on-time compliance costs and delayed compliance costs . Id . at 10,122 . For example , technology , in the years of non-compliance , could have improved pollution control mechanisms while reducing their cost . Thus , the cost of installing pollution control equipment after being notified of a violation would not be the same expenditure if the source had complied on time  --  it would be cheaper . See id . Singh , however , fails to take into account the importance of maintaining a level playing field in the regulated community . Non-compliant sources ' costs must be measured against the costs of those in the regulated community who did comply with the law on time . Even if pollution control mechanisms are cheaper to purchase after delayed compliance , the non-compliant source 's penalty should reflect the costs that the compliant sources incurred when they purchased the pollution control mechanisms on time . See id . See id . at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula ) . Singh shows that the year of compliance is represented by T ; the date compliance should have occurred is T-n ( n representing the length of delay ) ; the compliance cost is C1 in year T ; and the compliance cost in T-n is C2 . See id . Singh correctly points out that C1 = C2 = C ( C being the compliance cost ) because the model assumes that same piece of equipment is installed in both T and T-n . See id .
