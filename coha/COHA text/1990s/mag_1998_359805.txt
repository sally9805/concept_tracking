The daughter of Nashville session man Fred Carter Jr . proves that her quadruple-platinum CD Did I Shave My Legs for This ? was no fluke . Indeed , it was just a hint of Deana 's daring , of her composing gifts and rangy taste : country , rock , power pop . In a sly , dry , sweetly froggy voice that weirdly suggests young Bobby of King of the Hill , Carter draws four-minute portraits of unfulfilled wives ( Absence of the Heart ) , vengeful losers with an urge to arson ( Dickson County ) , abandoned kids whose saving grace is not knowing when to quit ( Angels Working Overtime ) . Twelve songs of hurt without despair are capped by Fred 's title song , a hymn to hope despite all . Hope on , folks . In Deana 's care , country music 's gon na be alright . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
