<p> Russian President Boris Yeltsin 's attempt to subdue the breakaway region of Chechnya has turned into a major military embarrassment for him and his high command , marked by battlefield failures , mutinous officers and a constantly widening credibility gap , according to Russian and Western analysts . <p> As ultimatums from Yeltsin pass without decisive action , evidence has surfaced of the Russian army 's low state of readiness , lack of training , beggarly supplies and poor coordination , according to these analysts . It has become apparent that many of the troops  --  from generals to common soldiers  --  oppose the military operation , often with remarkable openness . <p> But even more than the soldiers in Chechnya 's cold and muddy fields , analysts said , the top leadership in Moscow is to blame for underestimating the military challenge , overpromising Russia 's ability to cope with it and then seeking to cover up the truth . <p> " The question is why the military actions have started now , at the least appropriate time from a military point of view , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the main question , but there are many other questions as well . " <p> No one doubts that the Russian military , with perhaps 1.5 million men , along with Interior Ministry troops can defeat the Chechen forces , who are thought to number several thousand . The Chechens have no air force and few heavy weapons , and Russian units were reported tonight to be only a few miles from Grozny , the Chechen capital , after heavy fighting on the city 's northern outskirts . <p> In part , the Russian troops ' slow progress appears to reflect a genuine reluctance to take casualties or hurt civilians . But the events of the past eight days , since Yeltsin sent tanks , troops and warplanes into Chechnya from three directions , have humbled the once proud army and made a mockery of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 's early boasts . <p> " It would be possible to resolve all questions in two hours with one parachute regiment , " Grachev said on Nov. 27 . <p> Chechnya , a landlocked region in the Caucusus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years ago . Although no foreign governments recognized the claim , the Chechens  --  a proud and combative Muslim people who fiercely resisted Russian conquest in the 19th century  --  have been tweaking Moscow ever since . <p> Last summer , the Kremlin began mounting covert operations against Chechnya , each ending in humiliating failure . So , on Dec. 11 , Yeltsin sent an estimated 13,000 troops into the region and demanded a swift capitulation . <p> Instead , while top officials in Moscow have offered daily reassurances that Russian troops had encircled or would soon encircle Grozny , the troops have failed to do so . Moscow now will fly in thousands of reinforcements , including marines from the Black Sea Fleet and additional battalions from the Siberian , Urals and Volga military districts , the Interfax news agency reported today . <p> While some formations have refused orders to move forward for fear of harming civilians , others have wantonly killed fleeing refugees , according to reliable reports . Interior Ministry troops killed nine civilians this weekend and then flattened their cars with armored vehicles , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I travel around , and all I see is drunken soldiers and drunken officers manning the posts , " Lt. Gen. Valery Vostrokin , Russia 's deputy minister for emergency situations and an Afghan war veteran , told the Associated Press . " They have no discipline , and they go unpunished . " <p> Vostrokin joined the ranks of generals and deputy defense ministers speaking out against the war . " To be the aggressor , a policeman on our territory , is not a good job for the military , " he told reporters today . <p> While reporters have found morale high among some Russian troops , other units have vowed not to fight at all . Some soldiers have asked local citizens to burn their vehicles so that they will not have to fight any more , said Viktor Kurochkin , a member of parliament . <p> Ostalsky noted that Ingush villagers , who are ethnic cousins of the Chechens and often sympathize with them , were able to destroy 30 armored vehicles , in some cases with axes and fence posts . <p> Pavel Felgengauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most troops sent to Chechnya are young and untested in combat . Because the army is so short of funds , many of them have hardly even participated in military exercises . The army and Interior Ministry troops , thrown together here , have not trained in joint operations . <p> Because so many army units are short-handed , the expeditionary force also has been cobbled together from many places . Another member of parliament who just returned from the region said today that troops asked her what was happening one mile away . <p> The Russian soldiers are " young and unprofessional ... and excessively peace-loving in mood , " presidential adviser Leonid Smernyagin complained a few days ago . Gen. Alexander Lebed , a popular if somewhat renegade officer , said it more simply : The Russian troops sent to Chechnya , he said , are " snivelers . " <p> If some soldiers ' morale is low , it is not surprising . One conscript told the newspaper Izvestia that he and many others have fulfilled their required 18 months ' duty but were sent to Chechnya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were being paid $ 30 a month instead of the customary $ 3 . <p> The NTV television network tonight showed soldiers digging trenches in a swirling blizzard , while some tried to warm their hands over cranky camp stoves . They have no water for washing , the network reported . <p> But perhaps most difficult for the troops has been the lack of clear direction and planning at the top . " The army is depressed by the lack of meaning and clarity in their duties , " said Ella Pamfilova , a member of parliament who just returned from the region . <p> Sergei Yushenkov , the chairman of the legislature 's defense committee , said soldiers " do not understand why they have been sent there , and no one has explained to them what is actually going on . " <p> While Yeltsin and his top officials repeatedly have vowed to " disarm the bandits " defending Grozny , the top military brass evidently misled Yeltsin on how easy such a task would be , said one knowledgeable Western analyst . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timetable , " the analyst said . " When they bought off on a military solution , they bought off a real tough nut to crack . " <p> The Russians are facing partisan warfare in mountainous terrain , with extended lines of communication and no easy way to resupply their troops . Fog , snow and short days cancel much of Russia 's advantage in air power . The troops ' reluctance to hurt civilians , including many ethnic Russians who live in Grozny , further complicates and slows the campaign , the Western analyst said . <p> Capturing Grozny without many casualties will be difficult , the analyst added . But even then , the Russian army may face protracted partisan warfare in the countryside . <p> Moscow officials have responded to the bad news in many cases by claiming more success than witnesses in the field say is justified  --  reporting bombing raids that have not occurred , for example . At the same time , officials have stopped releasing official casualty figures and have threatened to strip licenses from news organizations whose reporting displeases them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked of Chechen " cruelty , " of highly paid Chechen mercenaries , of alleged Chechen vows  --  unconfirmed in Grozny  --  " to wage war on Russia . " <p> " They clearly do not want the country to know how costly it will be to brandish the constitution , " wrote Izvestia reporter Valery Yakov . <p> Presidential aide Smernyagin , speaking on NTV television Sunday , softened his criticism of the army , saying it should be praised for getting so far with so few civilian casualties . But he also acknowledged that Russia may not yet have seen the worst of the conflict . <p> " All that could be most terrible still lies ahead , " he said .
