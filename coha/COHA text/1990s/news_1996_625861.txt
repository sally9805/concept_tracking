<p> Finding ways to increase hunting opportunity in a state where all but a smidgen of the land is under private ownership is a tall task . But under orders from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to do just that , the state 's wildlife division is trying . <p> In the package of proposed changes in hunting regulations announced at the Jan. 24 meeting of the commission 's regulations committee , the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department wildlife division offered several ideas on increasing hunting opportunity . Much of the increased opportunity would come on TPWD-controlled lands ( state parks , wildlife management areas ) . But some of the proposals would have statewide implications . <p> Creation of a Texas Youth Hunting Weekend probably is the proposal with the widest application , although it 's not at all clear how much additional opportunity the plan will generate . <p> Under the proposal , Texas would join about 20 other states in letting young hunters have first crack at white-tailed deer and turkey . <p> If approved , the inaugural youth hunting weekend would be Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general firearms season for white-tailed deer and Rio Grande turkey . <p> The early hunt would be open to licensed hunters 16-years-old or younger and accompanied by a non-hunting adult . All other regulations ( bag limits , shooting hours , etc. ) would be in effect . <p> The youth hunt weekend certainly would draw some young hunters and their adult supervisors afield . But it 's open to debate whether it would attract people who would n't be out the next weekend , anyway . <p> If the agency opened some of its lands to youth-only hunts that weekend , it would generate more opportunity . About the only way to create more hunting opportunity in Texas is to open up previously closed lands to recreation . Since most of the huntable private land in Texas is already being hunted , and there 's no way to force private landowners who do n't allow hunting to crack their gates , the youth weekend wo n't really open any new territory . <p> But if TPWD set youth-only deer or turkey hunts for some of its wildlife management areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend would create more hunting opportunity . It 's an idea worth considering . <p> The agency 's overall public hunting program has been expanding over the past decade , and it will grow even more under the recent proposals . <p> The agency plans to expand its dove lease program , obtaining short-term leases for dove hunting . The program , which completed its second year this past autumn , has proved extremely popular with hunters . Dove hunting on the tracts , usually grain or sunflower fields , is available to anyone holding a TPWD-issued Public Hunting Permit . ( Hunters under 17 are not required to hold a permit as long as they are hunting with a permitted adult . ) <p> The public hunting permit , which this year increases in cost from $ 35 to $ 40 , also gives hunters access to more than a million acres enrolled in the agency 's general public hunting program . Along with land leased from timber companies and other private landowners , the public-hunting program covers the Sam Houston National Forest and tracts in other national forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracts also offer hunting for squirrel , rabbits , quail , dove , waterfowl and other game . <p> Also , the public-hunting permit exempts holders from the $ 6 daily access fees charged on the " " regular fee permit " hunts ( mostly for waterfowl , dove and quail ) conducted on wildlife management areas and state parks . The agency is slowly expanding these hunting opportunities , too . <p> Perhaps the biggest increase in hunting opportunity this year , at least for the average citizen looking to hunt on public land , comes in the proposal for this year 's package of " " special permit " hunts to be held on TPWD wildlife management areas and state parks . <p> The hunts are for various game - mostly deer ( modern firearms , archery , muzzleloaders and some youth-only hunts ) , but also covering exotics , feral hogs , javelina , turkey , alligator and pronghorn . Permits for these hunts are issued via a computer drawing of applicants . <p> This year , TPWD proposes expanding the number of parks and WMAs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Herb Kothmann of the wildlife division 's public hunting program said the agency proposes increasing the number of " " special hunt permit " to 6,000 , about 9 percent more than were issued this past year . Those hunts will be held on 39 state parks and 48 WMAs . <p> Several " " new " hunts are proposed on state parks as the agency continues taking advantage of a 1993 law passed by the Texas Legislature that allows the agency to set hunts for recreational purposes instead of limiting them to controlling overpopulations . <p> Among the new hunts proposed this year are gun deer hunts on Brownwood , Choke Canyon ( Calliham Unit ) , Dinosaur Valley , Garner and Honey Creek parks ) . An archery-only hunt is planned for Village Creek State Park , quail and javelina hunts on Big Bend Ranch State Park , and dove hunting on Mother Neff State Park . <p> Even with the increase in the number of TPWD-controlled areas open to hunting and the increase in permits to be issued , demand for these hunting opportunities far exceeds supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit , and some of the most popular hunts draw incredible numbers of applicants . For example , in 1994 , TPWD received 3,572 applications for the 10 pronghorn antelope permits it issued on the Rita Blanca tract . Almost 4,500 applications were received for the 54 permits offered for hunts on the Chaparral WMA . <p> Look for those numbers to grow this year as TPWD liberalizes the application process . <p> In the past , applicants were limited to applying for only one hunt area ( park or WMA ) within a particular hunt category . A person applying for an either-sex deer hunt on the Chaparral WMA could n't apply for an either-sex deer hunt on any other area , for example . <p> But TPWD proposes doing away with that stricture . Kothmann said the agency wants to change procedures to allow an individual to apply for multiple hunt areas within a hunt category . That almost certainly will generate thousands of more applications , even though each application will have to be accompanied by a $ 2 fee . <p> Those $ 2 application fees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the agency 's coffers . The fee goes to pay for the administrative costs associated with the program . <p> But a new proposal could bring in needed revenue . <p> Kothmann said the agency proposes to create a lottery-type system for a handful of special hunt packages to be offered to the public . The packages could be things such as a guided trophy mule deer hunt , a bighorn sheep hunt in the Trans-Pecos , or a guided aoudad hunt on Caprock Canyon or Palo Duro Canyon state parks . Persons wanting to apply for these hunts would pay a non-refundable application fee which could range from $ 2 to $ 25 , depending upon the hunt package . A computer drawing would pick the winner of the hunt . <p> Money generated by the application fees would go into the state 's wildlife , fisheries and water safety fund . <p> The proposals for changes in the public-hunting programs , along with all other proposed changes in hunting and fishing regulations , will be subject to comment during a series of public hearings to be held across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission will vote to adopt , modify or reject the proposals during its May 9 public meeting in Austin . <p> NOTES : Shannon Tompkins covers the outdoors for the Chronicle .
