<p> San Francisco 's Episcopal bishop , William Swing , has traveled around the world chasing his dream of a place in the Presidio where the world 's religions could come together for peaceful dialogue and conflict resolution . <p> Tomorrow , the world comes to Swing , when 200 delegates from historic religious traditions and new spiritual movements convene at Stanford University to begin working on a charter for an international interfaith organization , tentatively called the United Religions . <p> Sitting down together will be Christian ecumenical leaders , Black Muslims , American Jews , Australian aborigines , California pagans , South African Hindus , Thai Buddhists , British Baha'is , Catholic priests , Indian Sikhs and other leading lights from across the spiritual spectrum . <p> Important details  --  such as how the United Religions will function , where it will be located and who will pay for it  --  are to be worked out at a series of meetings between now and June 26 , 2000 , when the interfaith organization is scheduled to be established in San Francisco . <p> " Religion almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Swing , 62 , said in a recent sermon . " Gentle Buddhists are hurling grenades in Sri Lanka . Hindus and Sikhs are murdering Muslims in Jammu-Kashmir . Muslims are killing Christians in the Sudan . Christians are killing Christians in Northern Ireland . Bethlehem is under the paralysis of religious hostilities . " <p> Swing envisions the world 's religions " coming together on a daily , permanent basis , in pursuit of global good . " And what better place to do it , he asks , than at the Presidio , " where we could turn swords to ploughshares " ? <p> Q : Can you explain the genesis of the United Religions Initiative ? <p> A : In 1993 , the United Nations told me they were coming to San Francisco and they would bring 183 ambassadors from 183 nations . They wanted me to bring the religions of the world to Grace Cathedral for an interfaith service . Before that , I really was n't thinking about this at all . <p> And I went to bed that night , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the religions of the world , thinking that for 50 years , the nations have struggled for global good and that in the same 50 years , the religions of the world had n't spoken to each other . I had a deep sense of conviction that that has got to change . So I dedicated the rest of my life to be a catalyst for the creation of something like the United Nations for all religions . <p> . <p> Q : This is not necessarily a new idea . What happened in the previous efforts , and why did they fizzle out ? <p> A : In 1893 , with the Parliament of World Religions , it was so exciting to see religions together for the first time that people began expansively to think about something like this . <p> But there was no infrastructure , and there was no world consensus around that kind of idea , so it died . Then , when the League of Nations began , people began to say , " Why do n't we have a League of Religions ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgotten . Nobody really worked at it . It 's been much more a daydream than on-the-ground hard work , " Let 's see if we can make it happen . " <p> . <p> Q : How has your vision of the United Religions changed since you 've traveled around the world and held meetings on the concept ? <p> A : Last summer , we made a big decision that we would n't go just for the great religions of the world ; we would also go for modern spiritual movements . If you go with the great religions , you have men only . If you go with modern spiritual movements , you have women as well . We figured that 's an important step forward . <p> Then the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland called us up and said that ours was the most important initiative they 'd seen . They had worked on 50 global initiatives around the world that will change the next century and the next millennium and thought ours was far and away the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way . <p> We 've also had introductions to people all over the world . In the last couple of weeks , we 've had regional summits in Oxford , New York , Buenos Aires , and as soon as this big summit is over this week , we go right out to Cairo , Johannesburg , Nairobi , Belgium , Bombay and New Zealand . The world has responded to this in ways that we thought would take many , many years . <p> . <p> Q : Are you still talking about having regular assemblies with formal votes , and that sort of thing ? <p> A : No . We backed away off that . <p> . <p> Q : So it 's not really going to be patterned after the United Nations ? <p> A : Right . This summer , we 're going to start working on the creation of the charter . The first couple of things we are going to be working on are our vision , mission and values . Then we 'll work on priorities and organizational development . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is globalized . We 've started thinking about paralleling the United Nations as much as possible , but the more we 're into this , the more we find out that 's really a competitive kind of model . If we 're going to tap the source of religion , it 's not going to be about passing a resolution with a 61 to 39 percent vote . We 're going to have to find a consensus . <p> One of the people I talked with was ( the Swiss theologian ) Hans Kung . He says that there will be no peace among nations until there 's peace among religions , and there will be no peace among religions until there 's dialogue among religions . Our job is to start the dialogue aiming at peace among religions . <p> If we get into position papers on abortion or something like that , everybody 's just going to divide up into camps and go at it . We 've got to take several steps behind that to find out the basic values that the religions of the world hold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not create a United Religions if Rome invited everybody to Rome . People would be suspicious . And if Islam invited everyone to Mecca , or if the Jews invited everyone to Jerusalem , people would say , " Who 's controlling this ? " <p> What we 're trying to do is to find some common ground that would be created not by Islam or by the Roman Catholics or anybody else , but by a world that is getting tired of the religions killing each other . They would all bring the best they 've got to the table , and we could create a common ground so that we can enter into an exchange and a conversation . <p> It 's not so much voting as it is conversation and dialogue that would take its own natural course . <p> . <p> Q : And that solves the problem of deciding who really speaks for each religion and how many representatives each should have . <p> A : Right . We decided that the problem of representation is an impossible one . But at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ultimately will get everybody talking . <p> . <p> Q : Are you concerned that this might just evolve into a talk fest ? People will come to San Francisco and talk , but religious wars will still rage all over the world . Are you going to try to mediate religious disputes ? <p> A : Maybe we have to take a deeper look at theology . I think that religions are based on assumptions of truth being mediated from the creator to the created . Those truths are divinely inspired and sacred for the people who hold them . I think all the religions of the world have a blind spot . If there 's a United Religions pursuing a dialogue in depth , it begins to ask larger questions and force religions to make larger statements . <p> . <p> Q : Is n't a lot of the problem that many sacred scriptures are full of violent , exclusionary rhetoric ? <p> A : That 's right . And it 's taught all week long , every place we go . The religions have to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really what they believe . If you 're sitting there with people from other religions at the table , you might come up with other conclusions . <p> . <p> Q : When you sit down with a group as diverse as you 've got here , you ca n't say things like , " Well , we all believe in the same God , " or even , " We all believe in God . " You are including pagans , polytheistic traditions , non-theistic traditions . <p> A : Right . You ca n't say that . I 've been working with people , religious leaders around the world , and a lot of them have cautioned me to stay away from prayer and theology . When we get to Stanford , I doubt if we 're going to spend a lot of time talking about theology or prayer . <p> I think we 're going to be hunting for common values that spring from the theology , but not the theology itself . Because I do n't think we 'll ever agree on the theology . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process is that you 're just going to create some kind of amorphous spiritual soup and compromise everyone 's beliefs . <p> A : Well , I would have to say what 's happened to me personally , in terms of being exposed to the religious leaders of the world . I 've spent a lot of time praying with Brahmans , meditating with Hindus or being silent or chanting with Buddhists . I do n't think that has made me a more watered-down Christian . <p> I feel I 've been enormously enriched inwardly by exposure to these folks . I 've gone back and read our own scriptures , and it 's amazing how they begin to read differently when you 're exposed to more truth from more people in other parts of the world . I do n't think it 's going to be amorphous . <p> . <p> Q : How did you decide which 200 people would attend this conference ? A : We took the hundred religions , and mathematically , we said how many Hindus are there ? Well , there are 875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , close to a billion . How many Christians ? A billion or so . <p> Then we began to break that down and say , in terms of a ratio , how many that  --  if you 're going to deal with a hundred people ? That would mean eight Hindus , nine Muslims , and that sort of thing . <p> Then , on the other side , with the modern spiritual movements , we would say : " How about spirituality and the economy , how about spirituality and healing , how about spirituality and business , spirituality and arts ? Let 's aim for five people in this , and four people in this , and six people in that . " <p> . <p> Q : How are you defining these spiritual movements ? <p> A : I 'll give you an example . There 's a lady who deals with the Mountain People Forum . She has three mountain ranges in the world she works with , the Appalachian , Andes and the Himalayas , and deals with the medical , the educational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If there 's ever a United Religions , I 'd love to be affiliated with it , because we deal with the spiritual needs of people who do n't get counted by anyone . " <p> . <p> Q : Are you still hoping the United Religions can be in the Presidio ? <p> A : Yes . If there 's ever going to be a United Religions in our time , it 's going to have to be located in San Francisco . It 's a very uncompromising place . We 're not going to be paid off by any religion , we 're not beholden to anybody . The land  --  if we can get it  --  is fabulous . It 's very easy access , airports and that sort of thing . And the citizenry of the Bay Area is sympathetic to spiritual matters , without being possessive or controlling . <p> . <p> Q : What 's the scenario or the future possibilities at the Presidio ? <p> A : We 're opening up dialogues with the Presidio Trust . <p> The United Religions would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to be in San Francisco , and we ought to be in the Presidio . " I 'd like to set the stage so that it would be a very natural thing to do . <p> . <p> Q : You are thinking about having satellite centers around the world ? <p> A : Right . We do have a center in Washington , we do have a center in Johannesburg , we do have a center in Buenos Aires . And it will go on and on and on . We have people working for us all over the world . <p> So we will have many , many centers . For the next four years , we will be meeting in the San Francisco Bay Area to write the charter , and in the year 2000 , on June 26 , we want people of all religions to walk down their village or their town or their city to be a walking symbol of the religions together  --  and also to sign the charter at the end of the day . So the charter will be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hierarchical folks at the top . " <p> Several think-tanks have pointed to a spiritual bankruptcy at the bottom of capitalism , saying that there will be people in the next century by the hundreds and millions who will be spiritual immigrants , refugees , hunting for some place to invest their people 's trust . <p> . <p> Q : People often invest that trust in religious fundamentalism . Are n't those the people who will reject you , and the ones who need to listen ? <p> A : We 're not well enough known for people to reject us  --  which is kind of nice . We are getting rejected by some folks in the print media and on radio stations . We 've been called the anti-Christ . But we 're leaving the front porch light on for everyone . <p> We had some interesting responses , say , from fundamentalist Muslims in Pakistan and India  --  areas where we thought that the fundamentalists would say : " We want nothing to with this . " They said it would be a wonderful thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart about their faith . <p> So what I 've learned from that is : Just because somebody is a fundamentalist , do n't think that they do n't want to be in a conversation with us . <p> . <p> Q : Is getting this going taking longer than you expected ? <p> A : No . If you do n't mind , let me tell you a little story . I was in Rome a couple of months ago , and I was listening to a discussion between the Catholics and the Orthodox . And they said , " By the year 2000 , let 's all celebrate Easter together , our Lord 's Resurrection . We 'll do anything so that we can have the Resurrection celebrated by everybody on the same day . " And the other group said , " No way . " <p> They said , " No. 1 , it would offend some of our faithful , and No. 2 , we do n't have communion together , and therefore we are at disunity , and we do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want to give the world a symbol that we are at disunity . " You ask yourself : " How long has this conversation gone on ? " And the answer to that is : since 1054 . And you say , " If they ca n't even get together on Jesus ' Resurrection in a thousand years , are we going to bring a United Religions together in five years ? " <p> . <p> Q : It seems the closer you are , the more you have to argue about . <p> A : When I was in Jerusalem , I went to the Reform rabbis and said , " Will you come to the table ? " They said they 'd love to come to the table . Then I went to the Orthodox rabbis and said , " Will you come to the table ? " And they said , " We 'd love to come to the table . " Then they added , " Oh , by the way , if the Reform are coming to the table , we 're not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you look at all the conflicts in the world around religion , you have to ask the question , " Has organized religion done more harm than good ? " What 's your answer ? <p> A : When you start working on United Religions , and you do look at the dark side of religion , the question that you ask is a real question . Ultimately , you 've got to say : " What good is religion ? " Religion is the carrier of sacred tradition . But religions also have their own politics , their own control needs , their expansion , their competitions and intramural fights . <p> An awful lot of harm has been done in the name of religion . There 's a lot of bad religion out there . There are a lot of things that have to be healed in a lot of people 's psyches . On the other hand , religions have taught people to pray , religions have taught people to serve in communities . They work with young people and give them a sense of right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness of people in San Francisco in terms of the homeless , in AIDS wards and other acts of kindness that are religiously inspired . There 's an undercurrent of quiet greatness out there . <p> And religions teach people to sing , from the heart . If religions did nothing but teach people to sing , it would be a great thing . So , on the whole , I 'd say religions have done more good than harm . <p> TIMELINE FOR THE UNITED RELIGIONS INITIATIVE <p> * February 1993  --  Episcopal Bishop William Swing is asked to host an interfaith service at Grace Cathedral marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations .
