Aaron Bacon seemed a regular rebellious kid , a 16-year-old who grew suddenly moody , as adolescents often do . His poetry took on a violent tinge ; he stayed up late listening to music ; and he started skipping classes at his Phoenix , Arizona , high school . More worrisome , he was smoking a lot of pot-and maybe even selling it . It was probably just a phase , though his parents , Sally and Bob , will never know for sure . <P> After Aaron was attacked by a gang in the school parking lot , the Bacons decided to take action . Sally , an artist and real estate agent , remembered hearing about a child who had had a good experience at a wilderness-therapy camp , North Star Expeditions , Inc . The Bacons talked with North Star 's owners about the 63-day survival course in the south Utah desert . The program , the Bacons decided , could be just the thing to help their son get back on track . " I pictured Aaron sitting around campfires , being nurtured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles Times . " I thought I was sending him to a little slice of heaven . " <P> On March 1 , 1994 , Aaron 's North Star adventure began  --  an ordeal that resembled a desert hell and that ended one month later with the return of Aaron 's emaciated corpse to his parents . Last month a Panguitch , Utah , judge ordered North Star 's owners and some of its staff to stand trial later this year on charges of child abuse and operating a program in violation of state licensing standards . Lawyers for the owners contend that Aaron was uncooperative and refused to carry his backpack , thereby depriving himself of food and supplies . " While no one wants to use the word acceptable loss , the fact is Aaron Bacon showed up at North Star with a history of drug use and past involvement in drug sales , and he tried to control the situation with manipulation , " says defense attorney Sheldon Wellins , " and very unfortunately , he died out there . " <P> Aaron 's journal , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Garfield County deputy sheriff Celeste Bernards , tells a more harrowing story . Early in the trip he developed intense stomach pain , which an autopsy later revealed was caused by an ulcer , according to testimony by Utah chief medical examiner Todd Grey at last month 's pretrial hearing . In a civil suit , Aaron 's parents claim that some counselors taunted him for slowing down the group . As punishment , the suit continues , North Star took away Aaron 's sleeping bag , leaving him with only a blanket in the sometimes freezing desert nights . " I am in terrible condition here , " one of his final , anguished journal entries reads , " My hands are all chapped &; my lips are cracking . I feel like I 'm losing control of my body . " On March 31 , Aaron collapsed on the trail and died in the cab of a truck . <P> Aaron was not the first teen to lose his life on such a trip ; two teenage girls died in 1990 at similar Utah camps , run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set national standards for such programs . About 35 therapeutic wilderness camps have formed a coalition to establish comprehensive guidelines , and groups such as the Association for Experiential Education and the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children have begun putting an accreditation process in place . Says Jeff Liddle , who oversees the aee 's accreditation process : " In most states anybody who can buy some backpacks and print a brochure can be out there . "
