<p> 1 . THE RUNAWAY JURY , by John Grisham , Doubleday , $ 26.95 <p> This book has it all : mystery , legal maneuvering , behind-the-scenes views of a trial , jury tampering , and plenty of other skullduggery . Taking a page from today 's headlines , Grisham takes us to Biloxi , on Mississippi 's Gulf Coast , and the latest tobacco trial . It is no civics-textbook trial . Both sides are trying to fix the jury , but that panel seems to have a mind of its own . Grisham draws a finely detailed , realistic picture of the action and the characters . By Lawrence J. Goodrich <p> 2 . HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK , by Terry McMillan , Viking , $ 23.95 <p> People who enjoyed McMillan 's 1992 bestseller " Waiting to Exhale " may want to skip this surprisingly uneven follow-up . Gone are the well-drawn characters and storylines from the previous book , the author 's third . Instead , readers get a tensionless tale about a black divorcee in her 40s and her relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak plot ( based on events in the author 's life ) , the novel features one-dimensional characters and often wince-worthy dialogue . By Kim Campbell <p> 3 . THE TENTH INSIGHT , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 19.95 <p> Redfield 's sequel to his successful bestseller " Celestine Prophecy , " is also a poorly written , thinly disguised allegory . The book centers around the discovery of a 10th Insight that he says is necessary for " implementing these Insights , living them , ... fulfilling destiny " ( and selling more books ) . Redfield dabbles in spiritual healing , reincarnation , energy levels , and dimensional travel . There are glimmers of - forgive the pun - insight , but the whole is a mishmash of religion and new-age thinking . By Yvonne Zipp <p> 4 . A CROWN OF SWORDS , by Robert Jordan , Tor , $ 27.95 <p> To understand the mythical power struggles of this book , it is necessary to read the previous six books in the Wheel of Time series . Rand al'Thor - the Dragon Reborn - draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grips the world . The scenes lack nuanced detail and fail to stimulate the imagination . There is a complex hierarchy of authority ( the use of mental channeling by special classes of women to get what they desire and to destroy opponents ) all in a fierce quest for power . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 5 . THE CELESTINE PROPHECY , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 17.95 <p> Well-intended but poorly written , the plot is a cross between " Indiana Jones " and a self-help book . The hero is on a quest for a recently discovered Peruvian manuscript that details the progress of spirituality at the end of the 20th century . At different stages of the journey , he and his fellow searches discover spiritual " insights , " nine in total . Rather than profound , the book is awash in such cliches such as the need to " become conscious of the coincidences in our lives . " By Yvonne Zipp <p> 6 . MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU , by Mary Higgins Clark , Simon &; Schuster , $ 24 <p> The latest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent voice and an eye for detail . The protagonist is a gutsy photographer who must solve the tragic murder of her stepmother and sudden deaths of two of her stepmother 's friends . Set in Newport , R.I. , the action concerns romance and riches , both hidden and displayed . The ending is a bit predictable but does not detract from a stylish story . <p> By Terri Theiss <p> 7 . I was Amelia Earhart , by Jane Mendelsohn , Simon &; Schuster $ 18 <p> The author has composeed this novel as a sequence of short , sparely written , almost visionary passages . Third-person descriptions of Earhart and Fred Noonan ( her hapless navigatior ) alternate with first-person accounts in Earhart 's voice . They reflect the thoughts , memories , emotions , and longings that propelled this woman into a life of flight . The writing throughout is terse , austerely lyrical , and the emphasis is on the subjective and psychologocial . It is a paean to the ultimate escape . By Merle Rubin <p> 8 . THE FOURTH ESTATE , by Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinly disguised fictionalization of the rise and fall of media baron Robert Maxwell - intertwined with the rise and near-fall of Maxwell 's successful global competitor , Rupert Murdoch . Seven decades of history , destructive chutzpah , clever business strategy , and outsized egos are on parade . Archer is a better story teller than his more famous British MP literary forebears , Disraeli and Churchill . His hallmark : seamless interweaving of action and thinking , realistic characters . By Earl Foell <p> 9 . SUDDEN PREY , by John Sandford , Putnam , $ 23.95 <p> After a bankrobber named Candy is killed by police , her husband swears to avenge her death by killing the police officers ' families . John Camp , who writes under the pseudonym John Sandford , is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and veteran author . He has a keen eye for detail and provides his trademark graphic and sensual descriptions . Violence and coarse language pervade this otherwise well-written and suspenseful book . <p> By Abraham McLaughlin <p> 10 . MALICE , by Danielle Steel , Delacorte , $ 24.95 <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic . The story of Grace Adams 's recovery from childhood abuse and an unjust prison stint is clearly intended to sway readers on the subject of domestic violence . It presents a woman who rises above her own situation to help other women and children overcome theirs . But the drawn-out writing about her horrors overwhelms the plot , which races almost cursorily through its most interesting twists and turns near the end . By Terri Theiss <p> 11 . ANYTHING CONSIDERED , by Peter Mayle , Knopf , $ 23 <p> This is truly summer reading . Mayle 's clear style allows the reader to easily envision his characters and locations . For some it might be too smooth a read , almost like a screenplay ( which would be terrific ) . The hero 's vacation goes from simple to dangerously complicated as an innocuous briefcase becomes the prey of mobsters and cops gone bad . By far the best facet of this novel is the omission of sexual situations , foul language , and violence - even kids can read it . By Janet Moller <p> 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 25 <p> The design of this novel by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer is grand : to paint a panorama of America 's complex , often poignant , immigrant heritage , linking cameo portraits of Italians , Germans , French , Mexicans , Irish , Africans , Norwegians with the hand-me-down history of a small button accordion . But the execution , while elegantly written , is a catalog of gruesome death and meaningless doom , described in bizarre detail on almost every page ; ultimately , it is both ludicrous and depressing . By Ruth Wales <p> 13 . CHANCE , by Robert B. Parker , Putnam , $ 21.95 <p> Fans of Robert Parker mysteries featuring private eye Spenser will find the latest , " Chance , " more - and less - the same . Spenser , his pal Hawk , and psychiatrist girlfriend , Susan , are still a trio . The dialogue is still lively and profane , but the action sometimes lags . Set in Boston , with scene shifts to Las Vegas , the plot starts with a search for the missing son-in-law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murky world of disorganized crime , and erupts in gratuitous killings . By Ruth Wales <p> 14 . The Horse Whisperer , by Nicholas Evans , Delacorte Press , $ 23.95 <p> The storyline is formulaic , cliche laden , and noticeably influenced by " The Bridges of Madison County . " It depicts a strong tight- lipped Montana rancher able to see into the " soul " of horses , and a British-cum-New York successful magazine editor who experiences a midlife crisis when her daughter-on-horseback collides with a semi-truck . The editor finds herself in an extramarital affair with the rancher . Parental guilt about putting career first emotionally tugs throughout this soap opera . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 15 . Gods and Generals , by Jeffrey M. Shaara , Ballantine , $ 25 <p> This wonderfully engrossing book follows four Civil War personalities - Confederate Gens . Robert E. Lee and Thomas " Stonewall " Jackson and Union officers Winfield Scott Hancock and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain - in their transformation from prewar soldiers and scholars into wartime heroes . The characterization is fascinating and insightful . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything anyone could have imagined - including the principals in this narrative . By Keith Henderson
