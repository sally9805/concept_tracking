We tested skis for hardcores in the land of Holsteins and maple syrup. // WE WATCHED ADMIRINGLY . John Egan , designated extreme stud of the 1998 SKIING Magazine Eastern test team , was floating through the air like an unperturbed butterfly over the big rock that resides in the heart of Sugarbush 's steep , narrow , twisting Rumble . It was the sort of superhero stunt that defines Egan 's skiing life . But our admiration quickly turned to alarm when he landed his jump in an altogether unstudly manner and began skidding on one hip toward a spruce thicket . Just when impact seemed inevitable he deftly threw his skis sideways , abruptly engaged his edges , and came to a stop within inches of the trees . Moments later he rejoined the rest of our ski-test group and muttered , " I know what I 'm looking for in an all-mountain ski , and this is n't it . " It was a surprizing comment . The ski he was on , Salomon 's X-Scream Series , would prove a big hit with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stowe instructor Steve Jones would end up ranking it among their three favorites out of 20 test skis .

Because no two skis , or skiers , or situations are identical . What works well for one skier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for carving up the crud in an open bowl might be less than stellar in a narrow Eastern slot . That 's why we assembled a diverse team of testers and then made sure they skied on varied terrain and a wide range of snow conditions-two days at smooth-skiing Okemo followed by two days at rough-and-tumble Sugarbush . That way we could not only discover diversity of opinion but , more importantly , pinpoint the characteristics of each ski that everybody agreed on . Our skis were as diverse as our testers and test sites . We asked the ski companies to select their best all-mountain skis for Eastern conditions . We wanted good carvers for Eastern hardpack and groomers but also skis nimble enough to handle moguls and tight spots as well as stable enough to track smoothly through crud and float freely on powder days . In short , we asked for skis that could do it all . Judging by the wide variety among the 20 models we received-from skinny to midfat , light to heavy , stiff to soft , with sidecuts ranging from 26 meters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical shape ) it was obvious that different skis were designed to do it all in different ways . On our first day at Okemo , sunny and warm , we had a chance to test the carving ability of each ski on perhaps the East 's ultimate cruising mountain . Runs like Nor'easter , with its 1,500 vertical feet arrow-straight to the fall line and buffed to the max , were ideal for the job . Run after run , team members ripped down Okemo 's groomed boulevards . When it snowed on Day Two at Okemo , we had a chance to put the skis to the soft-snow and crud test as four inches of heavy gunk accumulated during the day . A week later at Sugarbush , the pattern repeated itself  --  hard snow on the first day , six new inches the second . Mogul runs like Stein 's and Lixi 's Twist , steep cruisers like Organ  --  grinder , the quirky terrain of Castlerock , and the off-the-charts territory that Egan finds fun were the perfect terrain counterpart to Okemo 's groomers . We sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluff , ice , powder , crud , corduroy , natural , machine-made . We skied wide , narrow , smooth , bumpy , steep , flat , you-name-it terrain . Our assignment had been to put 20 ski models through a comprehensive all-mountain test . After four days : mission accomplished .
