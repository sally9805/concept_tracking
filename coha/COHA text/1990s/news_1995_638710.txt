<p> WASHINGTON - In ways you might not even realize , interstate highways have changed your life - for better , for worse . <p> You can , because of this nearly 40-year-old government program , buy groceries cheaper , shop round-the-clock , drive farther for a scenic vacation and commute to a distant suburb . <p> But you 're also likely to spend more time stuck in traffic , see more urban sprawl on once pastoral land , think every mall in America looks alike and watch U.S. dependence on foreign oil grow . <p> The interstates - more than any other government program in the history of the United States - have revolutionized almost everything about us : how we shop , where we work , what we do for leisure and why we like cars so much . <p> Now this American icon , which celebrates its 40th birthday in June , faces a mid-life crisis . It 's reeling from problems , especially the quadrupling in road travel , that no one anticipated at its birth . It 's also confronting new stresses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interstates , 99.9 percent complete , are becoming a victim of their own success . Uncle Sam built them , the world 's most extensive highway network , and people came - too many people in too many places . <p> That success has pushed them to a crossroad . In their halcyon days - the first four decades - they helped catapult U.S. economic growth . Now , with a 60 percent boom in travel expected by 2013 , they threaten to strangle it . <p> In one sense , the question is this : Can our road to prosperity become our road to ruin ? <p> Already , congestion is costing us dearly . In 1991 alone , it robbed the nation 's 50 largest metro areas of $ 44 billion - in lost time and excess fuel consumption , concludes a study by the Texas Transportation Institute . <p> Congestion is getting worse in many cities , and if left unchecked , will do even more damage . People will spend more time getting to work , delivering goods and completing other tasks . They 'll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be less competitive on the international stage , " says Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater . " It means the 21st century wo n't be our century . " <p> Perhaps it takes an earthquake to see just how vital America 's interstates are to its economy . <p> In January last year , a powerful quake - a magnitude 6.6 - struck Los Angeles , causing three of its busiest freeways to collapse . Commuters and truckers spent thousands of hours taking alternate routes . <p> The cost to the region 's economy grew : $ 1 million for I-10 , known as the Santa Monica Freeway , $ 400,000 for I-5 and $ 1.6 million for the elevated Grapevine interchange on Rt . 514 . <p> The interstates have growing faultlines of their own . A computer-aided investigation by Hearst Newspapers shows that they , though designed to standards then ahead of their time , are starting to show their age : <p> Pavement : Nearly two-fifths of its pavement , pounded by increasingly heavy trucks , is in poor or mediocre condition . That 's 16,664 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-fifth is in " fair " shape . Only the remaining two-fifths is rated " good . " <p> Bridges : One-fourth of interstate bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete . They may not collapse today or tomorrow , but they need extensive - and costly - repair . <p> Safety . Fatality rates , despite an overall decrease in the last two decades , are in some areas many times the average for non-interstate highways . Congress ' upcoming repeal of the national speed limit is expected to hike the death toll on the nation 's roads - now about 41,000 a year - by 6,400 . <p> Congestion . More than two-thirds of the nation 's urban interstates operate at or near their maximum capacity at rush hour , a 50 percent increase from two decades ago . Interstates , with only 4 percent of U.S. highway mileage , now carry nearly one-fourth of U.S. travel . <p> The stresses of mid-life are mounting slowly - but surely . As Todd Schaefer , an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute , says : " It 's a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before . Unfortunately , you 're never sure when it will happen . " <p> The road to everywhere <p> It was n't suppose to turn out like this . <p> When the interstates were born , America was a different place . People watched " Ozzie and Harriett " and " I Love Lucy " on the console TV , listened to " Shake , Rattle and Roll " on their transistor radio or played Scrabble in the rec room . <p> Even then , Americans loved cars . Almost every family owned one . Drive-in movies were popular as was Jack Kerouac 's " On The Road , " a 1957 opus to the dizzying freedom of the open road . <p> Anthony Kane , the Federal Highway Administration 's executive director , says Uncle Sam is treading water . <p> " As we repair or replace bridges , just the same number becomes problematic , " Kane said . " So we barely keep pace with what by now is a system in the midst of a middle-age crisis . " <p> In a report this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transit are getting shortchanged . It estimates that in 1993 , for example , interstates needed $ 11.4 billion in capital investment to maintain their current condition but government spent $ 8.1 billion . <p> And that gap , likely to widen as Congress moves to slash the overall budget , does n't even account for the 2.4 percent annual increase projected for highway travel in the next two decades . <p> The money that motorists pay for every gallon of gas they buy , 18.4 cents , will still go mostly to fund federal highways . But some of that tax is now used for deficit reduction and mass transit , and DOT expects the rest wo n't be enough to meet increasing travel . <p> So for states , the future will be a rocky road . They - many of which have had trouble maintaining the system - will have to find ways within fixed or falling budgets to cope with growing demand . <p> The costs of congestion <p> As the interstates ponder their mature years ahead , the costs of their current crisis are mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest urban areas , according to the most recent annual report by the Texas Transportation Institute . <p> Los Angeles remains the most congested , followed by Washington , D.C. ; San Francisco ; Chicago ; and San Bernardino , Calif <p> San Diego has seen its rate of congestion - based on the amount of travel per lane-mile - increase the most , 56 percent between 1982 and 1991 . <p> Other areas that surged economically during the 1980s also saw a boost . Salt Lake City 's congestion rose 37 percent while Washington , San Francisco and Sacramento each had increases of 30 percent or more . <p> The costs of gridlock include not only lost time but also excess fuel . <p> The United States , because its economy is so large and relies so much on road travel , burns massive amounts of motor fuel - half of which now comes from abroad . This dependence on foreign oil has foreign policy implications , as witnessed by the United States rescue of oil-rich Kuwait in 1991 . <p> The huge consumption has environmental effects . Cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . New cars now average 28 miles per gallon , up from 14 in 1974 . <p> But fuel efficiency for cars has stagnated in recent years . And trucks , which are getting bigger , have barely improved their efficiency since 1960 . <p> Together , cars and trucks already account for one-fourth of the nation 's carbon dioxide emissions . They account for nearly two-thirds of carbon monoxide and almost one-third of lead and nitrogen oxides . <p> More vehicles in the future , unless they get cleaner or travel controls stricter , will mean more emissions . <p> The future frontier <p> With the costs of gridlock looming , the interstates face a future in which they may not be bigger - only 73 miles have yet to be completed - but they may be more efficient . <p> Nearly everyone agrees that the mature years , which will have little money but a lot of demand , have to take a new approach . They argue the old one - simply building more roads - has only fueled further travel . <p> " Widening highways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your belt , " says Stephen Goddard , author of " Getting There : The Epic Struggle Between Road and Rail . " <p> Slater , the federal highway administrator , agrees . " We ca n't continue to build our way out of congestion . " He says roads and cars have been instrumental in U.S. economic growth , but he adds : " We have to look beyond them . " <p> Since 1991 , Uncle Sam has made an effort to do so . That year , Congress passed a landmark transportation bill known as ISTEA , the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act . <p> The bill emphasized the need to use technology - the information superhighway - to boost the efficiency of the current traditional highway . <p> An example is better traffic management . <p> TransGuide , a new $ 32 million center in San Antonio , Texas , that is the first of its kind in the United States , uses fiber optic cabling to monitor traffic in real-time . It can instantly identify accidents , dispatch help to clear them and give motorists up-to-the-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel more automatic . Two decades from now , when you get on the interstate , the road - not you - may do the driving , allowing bumper-to-bumper cars to move quickly . Yet no one knows whether high-tech will cure the current crisis . It is expected , though , to temper slightly the surging demand in travel . People will be able to use home computers to do dozens of tasks without stepping outside : working , shopping , paying bills , keeping in touch with faraway friends . <p> The bill also gives states and metro areas greater flexibility in how they can spend federal money earmarked for transportation . <p> Salt Lake City and about 40 other communities nationwide now have light rail projects under way , many designed to alleviate highway congestion . <p> But the move toward a multi-modal America - one that offers several transportation options - will take time . Road and rail have competed fiercely throughout this century . And often the auto-highway lobby , which represents thousands of companies and millions of workers , has prevailed . <p> Federal transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the growing challenge in their own commutes to the office . <p> Travel on the area 's already congested highways is projected to increase 70 percent in the next 25 years . <p> That 's why business , political and environmental leaders here are now working together to form a regional transportation plan , one that combines new roads with new mass transit , for the coming decades .
