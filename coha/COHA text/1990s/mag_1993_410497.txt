The Catholic writer Henri Nouwen is one of the most popular contemporary religious authors , well known for such books as The Wounded Healer ( 1972 ) and Creative Ministry ( 1971 ) . His most recent books , Life of the Beloved ( Crossroad ) and The Return of the Prodigal Son : A Meditation on Fathers , Brothers and Sons ( Doubleday ) , illuminate his decisions to leave , in turn , teaching positions at Notre Dame , Yale Divinity School and Harvard Divinity School to work among the severely handicapped at the Daybreak Community in Toronto . Beyond the Mirror ( Crossroad ) chronicles his recovery from a serious car accident . I spoke with him in Toronto about his ministry and its relation to his writing . At the close of The Road to Daybreak you say , " It is through writing that my hidden life with God and the handicapped people can become a gift to the church and the world . " How did you become a writer ? I never thought of myself as a writer . My main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word and be a teacher , someone who brings God 's word to people . That 's how the writing started originally . In 1966 or so I was asked to give a series of talks at Notre Dame on the mental health of priests . I presented the talks and a reporter from a religious newspaper asked to publish the whole thing . Then they asked again . I said , " No , I 'm not a good writer ... " But then I was asked for more talks , and that 's how Creative Ministry came about , in five lectures . So I always think of very specific people to whom I have to speak . Somebody comes to me with a specific question , out of a concrete theological situation . Otherwise there 's nothing there . Life has to give me something , people have to ask me something , or I have to go through some situation I 've never experienced before . Reaching Out , The Wounded Healer  --  these came from talks to classes on personal things in my life and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your work . They sense in you a companion , not simply an authoritative voice , Two passages of scripture are especially important and powerful to me . The first is Jesus ' conversation with Peter , when he asks him if he loves him : " Then feed my lambs , feed my sheep . " Then Jesus says , " When you were younger , you could go where you wanted ; now you are old you will be led where you do n't wish to go ... " As I grow older , the less and less I know where I am going . More and more I am aware of how not in control I am . We think when we are young that we are dependent , and that when we are older we will go where we want to go . Jesus turns that all around . Writing is for me a way of continuing to express myself , to show where I am led in this part of my life . When I nearly died , it was an enormous grace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car accident . When I write I integrate experiences into myself , and also let others know where God has been leading me  --  often it 's to a place I 'd rather not go , but it 's one that pushes me closer to a communion with Jesus . The other text is the passage where the good shepherd lays down his life for his friends . This has always been a great issue for me . I feel the longer I live , the more I want to live for others . Now , I live a lot of loneliness , a lot of pain , a lot of joy and confusion  --  and I have to be very honest with others . I do n't want to disappoint people and say , " Frankly , my life : is n't going very well right now . " That 's a big risk , to say that what happened to me was not a step up . I have to share that , though . There is a risk here : that the more I write , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to get caught having to live a " good " life so that the books are better ! You reach an astonishing audience for a religious writer . My books are simple . Of course , my English is simple , but it is more than that : I have simple things to say . My friends who read my manuscripts always say , Big words to small  --  simpler , simpler . And that 's right . All I ever wished to be was a priest in a small Dutch parish . I was a very poor student ; I barely made it academically . I went to seminary with no thought of going to university . After I was ordained , the bishop wondered if I would like to study psychology . I did and I enjoyed it . Then I came to America for postdoctoral work at Notre Dame , and then Yale , and then Harvard . And in that whole journey my writing has never been scholarly . When Yale approached me about teaching , I pointed to the little book called Intimacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ; this is what I do . " I am determined to be myself , despite academic standards . They said fine , no problem . Your training as a psychologist has left you well positioned for spiritual direction today , because in our secular age we use and are used to therapeutic language , You have been able to translate between these worlds , You 're right that psychology has affected my thinking a lot . But from the beginning I have tried to stay faithful to the word of God  --  not replace it with psychological knowledge . Studying psychology made me very aware of human behavior and human dynamics , but my study also made me more aware of the limitations of psychology and the importance of being faithful to biblical language and the reality this language incarnates . Therefore I have always been very concerned to speak , to write , as much from my experience of God as from people 's behavior and daily experience . In the past few years , and especially since my accident , I have had the desire to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not just from the experience of living in the world . Not that I am God , or know God . But I am called to live in communion with God , and from that communion to describe the world  --  its suffering and anguish , its war and peace , the experience of being handicapped , to look at these experiences more and more " from above " ( not that this " from above " has any quality of being distant ) . Your writing could be called a bridge between the language of the ego and the language of the soul , And today , the traffic on the bridge is no longer one way , That 's a good image . You try to build up the ego , and on the other hand to empty it . We need affirmation of the self , but also the surrendering of the self . Today we try to claim our full humanity , but we are also called to allow God to transform that humanity . We believe in upward mobility and Jesus calls us to downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have an ego . You can not receive answers when you do not even have your own questions . You can not be invited to silence when you are not even allowed to speak . You can not know God if you do n't even know who you are . All this is true , but it is just the first step . We need affirmation in the beginning so that in the end we can give it all away , surrender the whole self to God . Jesus said he was going to send his spirit , and that his spirit will lead us to the full truth . The Spirit is stifled and extinguished when the emphasis is on me . I claim my rights , my spiritual rights and individual rights ... yes , that 's there . But it is only there when you 're willing to lay down your lie or your friends  --  to forget about yourself for the poor , to pour out your life . Jesus pours out his life : " Eat me , drink me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die even more for others . I keep wondering if there is not a new mysticism to be discovered , a new way of surrendering , which is not passive but more like actively giving away so that the Spirit can get hold of us and give us away . As a writer , and one with a powerful public persona , it must be hard to be someone who is transparent in this way . That 's a real issue . I left Harvard to live in this community as a way not to let that persona dominate my life , and to have a place to return to where I can be held safe by people who are not looking at me as a persona at all . In a community of the handicapped , you ca n't have a persona , they know you so well . People with severe handicaps have no interest in you as a writer or as a famous person . That is something that gets in the way rather than something that excites them . They want you to be home , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a bath or a little lunch  --  simple things . My father was a lawyer  --  that is the world I came out of . My " success " was pleasing to my parents . But I discover more and more in the spiritual life that we have to be grounded beyond all that , in a life that is not dependent on success because we are hidden in the hollow of God 's hand . The people here are the ones who hold me there . I know I have to continue to write ; it 's clear it is a vocation . In the beginning I doubted that . But now , after 30 books , I tell myself , " Maybe you 're a writer after all . " But now I have a home . The community needs me  --  I need them . Books come and go , but I have to follow my journey . Memories are very important to your theology  --  memory as remembrance , The older you become the more you have to remember . But what 's more important is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible accident , in which we lose our family , our house , our job . You might remember that as the end of your happiness . I might remember it as the beginning of a new life . What happens to us is less important than how we remember , how we make these memories part of our bodies , our hearts . The longer we live the more things there are to remember and the more things there are that happened differently than we expected . And there are interruptions and hurts and wounds , things that did n't work out the way we thought . There is also our memory of people , people who love us , people who positively and negatively affected us , someone who left us , someone who died . Did we waste our time , our love ? Or can we reclaim them as part of the journey deeper into our truths ? Far too many people have things happen , and they go on hardly remembering the events of the previous day . Life sort of dies out behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too busy to remember and now that 's gone . The whole mystery of our redemption is that Jesus says , " It 's good for you that I leave , " so that he can send his spirit . That 's what memory is all about  --  so that he can send us his spirit , interiorly . " I will give you my spirit , " and that spirit will help you remember what I said in the right way . I do n't mean we remember something that is merely past ; we celebrate now the presence of the One who remembers us . Once we have that kind of attitude , all of life can be lived as part of the ongoing life of the spirit . Yes , my mother died , but I 'm closer to her now than when she lived . Yes , this friendship fell apart , or this marriage did n't work out , and it 's very painful . But does this bring me closer to the depths of who I am ? Do I accept the invitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths of my being ? To be this trustful is to know in every little moment we live that everything is meant to bring us into the heart of God . When you share stories about yourself , you can be hard , even brutal , with yourself , I must ask myself , When am I sharing things that help people get closer to God , and when am I sharing things so that people say , " Well , Henri Nouwen can stop complaining about that ! " ? I do n't want to say , Look , I 'm bleeding . Sometimes I transgress this line . Several years ago I had an emotional crisis that was so profound that I decided to leave the community and take care of myself . Those eight months were an agonizing time for me . I kept a journal then ; it 's the rawest stuff you can imagine . It was so personal I wondered if I should publish it . Some friends felt strongly it would not be wise to publish it , that it offered no imagery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But others said it was the best thing I had ever written . They said it would reach people I never reach . I decided to write the book on the Prodigal Son instead , to integrate what I learned in that period and tie it to an image . You are honest enough to say that the lessons you learned " at the portals of death " are not easy to translate into daily life . Being near death was a profound experience . I learned I already belong to God . I am beloved . Lately I have been thinking that the spiritual life is like this : We are taken , we are chosen , we are blessed , we are broken , and we are given by God . We are all the Chosen , set aside by God . Then there is the blessing , the joy , where we know we are the beloved . " On you my joy rests . " Jesus knew this . People liked and hated him , they blessed and rejected him , but somehow he remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's favor rests , and I find that crucial . Once we are in touch with the blessing , we can live with our brokenness in a very different way . Is that how memory is transformed ? This is the breakthrough . Many people live their brokenness under the curse . They do n't think they are loved , or held safe , and so when suffering comes they see it as an affirmation of their worthlessness . The great question of ministry and the spiritual life is to learn to live our brokenness under the blessing and not the curse . How can people hear that they are fully loved ? People who do not love themselves have a hard time knowing this . They might even be violent to get the love they desperately need . Jesus became flesh to respond to that yearning . Now , I constantly fall back to that same old place . That is why I ca n't say , " I know I 'm loved , so you 'd better ... " At times I get really depressed , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this truth . I get angry or jealous , or someone does n't come visit me , or I do n't have anyone to show affection to me  --  then I feel abandoned and rejected and go right into a hole . Ministers , priests and rabbis often feel they need more affirmation and affection than they get . Ministers have to be more radical than anyone in living a contemplative life  --  which means living a life in which we trust that the love we need will be given to us by God . That is essential to the prayer life . On the other hand , we really need some people around us who are willing to support us affectionately in the name of God  --  to help pull us back to the Source . I 'm much more in need of that than some other people are . That 's why I 'm writing these themes  --  because I am in touch with this pain . My books are n't particularly from someone who has his act together . They are from someone always searching , wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is given to me for others too . I need to be trusting enough to know that God will give me more than I ever dreamed of if I am just faithful to the people I am here for .
