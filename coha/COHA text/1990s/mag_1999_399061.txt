The government ca n't afford to keep ignoring the case rearming civil service tenure <p> JIM WORKED IN A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT office with an employee whose lack of productivity was matched only by his hostile attitude . Eventually , a good manager with the patience of Job , a mastery of detail to match , and the help of higher management took the time to record , day by day , the offender 's record of non-work . After developing improvement plans for the employee and thoroughly documenting his failure to meet them for many months , the incompetent worker was actually fired . Then , the employee appealed before the Merit Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) . Two years into the appeal , when it looked as if the government would finally win , MSPB threw out the case when one of the team , moving to dismiss the employee , made an offhand remark that " even the people in his neighborhood association think he 's unstable " The employee was reinstated with back pay . The agency went through the process all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of hindsight and existing records , the final try took only one more year of work ! <p> Jim 's predicament is faced by thousands of hardworking federal employees who must suffer a small number of lazy , incompetent , and , occasionally , dangerous co-workers . For the past three years , I taught high level federal managers at the Federal Executive Institute ( FEI ) . Despite the stereotypes about bureaucrats , the vast majority of federal managers are capable people who take pride in their work . In dedication and smarts , the government bureaucrats I 've worked with are more than a match for the college professors I taught alongside during 15 years in the academy . Unfortunately , these good people are thoroughly frustrated by a personnel system which forces them to work alongside ( and get the same raises as ) a small number of turkeys . A Broken Personnel System <p> One of my games in the civil service was to ask a lunch table full of federal managers whether it was possible to fire low-performing employees . Save for the ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible , but hardly ever worth the effort . My informal focus groups mirrored public employee surveys . <p> While career civil servants and political appointees do not always see eye to eye , mail surveys I conducted in the mid-1990s found that each side did agree that the federal personnel system is broken , at least when it comes to separating non-performers . Eighty-eight percent of Clinton political appointees and 83 percent of career managers agreed that " personnel rules make it too difficult to fire personnel "  --  more than half of each group strongly agreed . This dovetails with the findings of University of Georgia political scientist Hal Rainey . Reviewing years of survey data , Rainey reports that " roughly 90 percent of the public managers agreed that their organization 's personnel rules make it hard to fire poor managers and hard to reward good managers with higher pay , while 90 percent of the business managers disagreed " <p> Since courts have ruled that federal employees have property rights in their jobs , they can only be terminated after lengthy due process and multiple venues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use official means to deal with turkeys may face the prospect of spending all their time managing that one person , to the detriment of the rest of the office . As one of my informants , a manager in a regional office , recalled of his one ( eventually successful ) effort to separate an employee who was both unproductive and breaking the law : " As the year went on , it took more and more of my time and became all consuming . I had to spend a lot of time explaining why I was doing this " Similarly , when asked if he had ever fired a non-performer , one manager told me that he had no intention of becoming like the one person in his agency who had fired several people and " wears that as a badge of honor , but he has no time to do his real work ! " <p> Not only is firing a government employee time-consuming for managers , it is also dangerous . Managers who move against problem employees take serious risks . As Carolyn Ban details in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel actions need not go gentle into that good night . They can make life difficult for months or years . They can take their case to the Merit Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) . They can file a grievance if they are covered by a union contract . Or if they belong to a protected class ( by sex , race , age , or handicap ) , they can file an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint . Some bring their cases to the Office of the Special Counsel , claiming that they are being fired or otherwise harassed because they are whistle-blowers . <p> The problem of " low performing whistle-blowers " is particularly vexing for many federal managers , who , on the word of a single employee , can be subjected to prolonged investigations worthy of an independent counsel . Imagine having colleagues and subordinates questioned for months about whether you have ever used the long-distance line for personal calls or have padded the expense account . While the investigations go on , little work gets done and communication between co-workers stops , since everyone is afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when the boss is exonerated , a bad reputation can linger for years . And of course , if all else fails , the employee can simply sue his or her manager . <p> Not surprisingly , managers who have fired someone describe the process as traumatic . As one of the officials quoted above recalls , " here it is years later , the person has long since left the state , and I still do n't want to talk about that sorry episode . It has an impact upon both the office and the family life of the individuals involved . It 's something you only do once : ' <p> With the deck stacked against them , federal managers tend to avoid using official means of dealing with their turkeys . Phone surveys of managers by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) , reported in Poor Performers in Government : A Quest for the True Story , found that only 7.5 percent of the managers of low performing employees moved to reassign , demote , or remove them , and 77.8 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While OPM gives a rough estimate of around 65,000 poor performers in government , from September 1997 to September 1998 , only 159 federal employees were removed by performance based personnel actions , with another 1,693 removed for issues other than performance , such as breaking the law . Federal managers suffer low performers or act informally to improve their work and never use the federal personnel system , or only use it as a last resort . <p> Not infrequently , federal managers use two traditional means of shedding non-performers . By writing glowing letters of recommendation , a boss can get a turkey promoted to a different office . Fortunately , most civil servants are too ethical to use such tactics , and anyway , you can only do that once or twice before your credibility in the bureaucracy is shot . More typically , bosses place non-performers in " turkey farms , " " dead pools , " or ( if it is a single person ) " on the shelf ? . ' By quarantining non-performers , a good manager can save the rest of the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a small number of poor performers has the effect of making that small number vexing to managers , who are people more used to solving problems than ignoring them . Managers do n't like using turkey farms , but many feel they have no choice . At least , when downsizing comes , known turkeys make good candidates for reduction-sin-force . The Costs of Tenure <p> The sad part is that the vast majority of federal personnel do a good job . OPM 's Poor Per , truers in Government report estimates that under 4 percent of federal civil servants are non-performers . One can quibble with OPM 's methodology . I suspect that the real figure is a bit higher , but still , the poor performer problem is not nearly as bad as most Americans think . So why deal with it at all ? <p> Aside from inefficiency , there are four huge costs of the federal government 's inability to kick turkeys off the farm . First , non-performers themselves never get the message that they have to shape up or ship out and never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often use the system to pursue old grudges for years . Second , good employees like Jim are forced to work alongside , do the work of , and often get the same raises as a small number of turkeys  --  a real morale killer . <p> Third , the low performance problem undermines the image and self-image of the bureaucracy . Business people have no tenure and look down on their government cousins who do . Military officers have an " up or out " promotion system  --  at key points in their careers officers either get promoted or get discharged . This makes the officer corps , at least at higher levels , a turkey-free zone , giving the brass a certain swagger in their dealings with their protected cousins in the civil service . <p> Most important , a tenured civil service undermines the legitimacy of the bureaucracy in the eyes of the public . After all , very few voters have tenure , so it is hard to tell citizens why their public servants can not be fired . It is not surprising that college professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under attack in recent years . The very existence of tenure protects a small number of losers and leads the public to suspect the existence of a large number of low performers in government  --  a suspicion shared by many public managers . <p> Originally , the federal merit system was set up in 1884 to keep political parties from using government jobs to reward supporters . Patronage was seen as particularly onerous after President Garfield was assassinated by an insane " disappointed office seeker " Presumably , government would work better if run by technical experts than by political hacks . But on the federal level , at least , the spoils system got a bum rap . Even in the 19th century , a new president and Congress kept most of the incumbent civil servants in place , and only rarely replaced those with special expertise . Politicians have never relished the unpopular task of firing old employees to replace them with political supporters . As politicians have long lamented , each new political appointment provides 10 enemies who themselves wanted the job and one ingrate who got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared ( and still care ) about the efficient management of government . As political scientist Michael Nelson has pointed out , even in the 19th century , more voters sent mail than delivered it . A party that replaces all the mail carriers disrupts service  --  not a good way to win re-election . <p> The temptation to " politicize " a bureaucracy in search of pork is even less apparent today . In the old days , political campaigns were won by precinct workers who might welcome a federal job . Today , politicians depend on big kickbacks from campaign contributors rather than small ones from government employees . More important , the greater size and expertise of modern government makes it less susceptible to political takeovers . In the old days , it may have made some sense for politicians to hire friends to deliver the mail , but imagine if a modern president hired precinct workers to run the Pentagon and NIH ? To think that politicians would raid the civil service , you have to assume that they have an incredible capacity for both venality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , modern presidents can hardly handle the 3,000 political appointments they have now . How could they place more ? Sure , presidential political appointments have grown in number since 1960 , but not nearly enough to match the growth in congressional staffs , interest groups , and reporters  --  the people appointees deal with on behalf of their agencies . Unless we downsize the rest of the Washington political class  --  something not likely to happen  --  we ca n't downsize political appointments . <p> Because of constant scrutiny by opponents , politicians in Washington do not have the sort of vast appointment powers they might have in some states and dries . Presidents are in fact very constrained in who they can appoint to government jobs and how many appointments they can make . The Washington Post test ( " How will it look in The Post ? " ) limits what they can do . Congressional scrutiny limits what they can do . Inter- and intra-party battles limit what they can do . Not surprisingly , the worst abuses under spoils were in states and localities with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . Rebuilding Public Service <p> To its credit , the Clinton administration has at least acknowledged the non-performer problem , and has begun to act on it . In accord with the Poor Performer study , OPM issued a CD-ROM guide to help managers , Addressing and Resolving Poor Performance . This is more than previous administrations dared try , but probably too little , too late . Not surprisingly , as the longtime guardian of the merit system , OPM 's basic inclination is to save a system that should probably be buried . Real change in the merit system requires legislation to simplify procedures , followed by years of culture change inside government , along the lines of the National Performance Review 's reforms of government procurement . The White House considered introducing a bill to overhaul the civil service earlier this year but dropped it in deference to public employee unions , an important constituency in the 2000 presidential primaries . <p> Real change is occurring on an ad hoc basis , however , in the agencies . Currently , the Federal Aviation Administration and Internal Revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . The Pentagon and Department of Housing and Urban Development have floated trial balloons proposing to replace most tenured civil servants with contractors and fixed-term employees who can be separated with relative ease  --  something that is happening incrementally all over government . Further , the rise of Performance Based Organizations , called for by Vice President Gore 's Reinventing Government reports , is likely to erode tenure by tying organization budgets and staffing levels to results . Indeed , on all levels of government , the reinventing movement is in part a way to use market mechanisms to get around civil service tenure . Declining demands for an organization 's outputs force reductions in force , which in turn push marginal performers out the door . <p> Many of the most exciting changes are happening in the states . More than 30 states now have serious proposals to reform their civil service systems , but Georgia has gone the farthest . In 1996 Georgia removed tenure from new employees in state agencies . A detailed evaluation of the Georgia experiment does not yet exist , but early work by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of public managers to manage for accountability . A single Georgia state agency reported terminating nearly 200 employees for cause in the first 20 months after the law came into effect  --  with no reported challenges or cases of impropriety . Notably , the Georgia civil service reform was developed and pushed through the legislature not by anti-government Republicans but by then Governor Zell Miller , a pro-government New Democrat who sees ending tenure as one way to restore the legitimacy of government . <p> In short , for the first time in decades , real civil service reform is beginning to happen . For historic context , it took 20 years from 1864 to 1883 to build political support for the original federal merit system , and another 40 years to put it in place . It may take another decade to reform the federal merit system , but tenure now lacks public legitimacy , and the first steps at reform have already been taken .
