<p> BATTERED by war , starved by economic blockade , and beset by an unusually cruel winter , the nation of Armenia fights for its survival . <p> The once-modern capital city of Yerevan has regressed to a village . Under daily snowfall , the city 's 2 million people huddle in icy apartments without heat or running water . Electricity runs two hours a day , if at all . Industry has ground to a halt . Two-thirds of the work force , by one estimate , is unemployed . All schools are closed until March , when the harsh winter should have eased . <p> With the subway and trams running sporadically at best , the populace is afoot . Armenians spend their days in a desperate search for scarce food or sawing branches from the trees in city parks to burn in homemade stoves . Only a fraction of the telephones work . Even if the power flows into the phone lines , many will not ring . On the roads leading out of the city , telephone wires lie on the ground ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> People stave off starvation with a daily soup of potatoes , onions , or whatever else can be found , plus the government ration of 250 grams ( 8.75 ounces ) of bread - about half a loaf . By Saturday even the bread will be gone as Armenia 's wheat supplies will run out before scheduled American grain aid arrives , US officials say . Already , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , the death rates for those over 60 and under 2 years of age are 20 percent greater than last winter , when similar circumstances , though less severe , prevailed . <p> Stuart Willcuts , who runs the ICRC relief operation here , has spent 20 years working in the Somalias and Bangladeshes of the world , trying to help them start up the ladder of development . <p> " This is the first time I 've been in a country that was developed that we 're trying to keep from going all the way to the bottom of the ladder , " he says . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the lights go out . " <p> Armenia 's plight is shared in some part by all the former republics of the Soviet Union . The collapse of the centralized Soviet economy and the difficult transition to the free market have shattered their economies . <p> The unique character of this crisis comes from the bitter undeclared war with neighboring Azerbaijan , the product of a five-year struggle to free the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azeri control . <p> For two years , Azerbaijan has imposed a blockade , cutting the rail and gas lines which were Armenia 's main links to the outside world . A civil war in neighboring Georgia severed the other main rail line about six months ago . <p> The last remnants of a modern society depend on a gas pipeline running from Russia through Georgia . That line has been repeatedly blown up by what Armenians believe are Azeri-sponsored terrorists , most recently on Feb. 10 . The only source of energy now is a hydroelectric plant drawing water from the shrinking Lake Sevan . <p> Only one route to the world remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks are allies of their ethnic brethren in Azerbaijan and historic enemies of Armenians , who were driven from ancient homelands in Western Turkey during World War I at the cost of an estimated 1.5 million dead . <p> Under pressure from the United States and other Western nations , Turkey is now allowing the dispatch of relief supplies over the railway , though Western aid officials here say it is still a trickle . <p> " This is not the first difficult , cold winter for Armenians , " says former Foreign Minister Raffi Houvannisian , an Armenian-American who resigned his post last fall . " But there is an unfortunate sense among the people that they have been abandoned to their fate . " <p> On the street , people blame the government more than the Azeris for their troubles . Some , such as mathematician Lili Nersesyan , talk bitterly of " the indifference of the world toward Armenia . " But not a single person voices regret over independence or is ready to abandon his brethren in Nagorno-Karabakh in order to end the suffering here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the city . Amid general deprivation , Armenia is struggling to house and support about 360,000 refugees who fled from homes in Azerbaijan . The most recent influx are 16,000 who came last summer after an Azeri offensive seized two Armenian-populated regions in Karabakh . <p> About 24 families of refugees from that assault are tightly packed into what were the dormitory rooms of a school for retarded children . The group , whose members range from grizzled old men to young children , walked 17 days over the mountains to reach Armenia last June . <p> But the effects of war have followed them . The refugees are freezing , their darkened floor heated only by two wood-burning stoves around which the families sit in their coats and hats . The parquet floorboards are disappearing into the furnaces . The children are not allowed outside for fear they will get sick . <p> The refugees say not a single ruble has been paid in salary or relief assistance for the last two months . The government can provide only the daily bread ration and when it does not arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We are waiting for the partisans to recapture our village , " says Greta Zagaryan , who lost both her husband and son to the fighting . " We hope to go back . " <p> Already about 400 refugees are returning to Karabakh every three weeks , reports Willcuts . " Conditions are not that different , so if you 're going to suffer , you might as well suffer at home , " he says . <p> At a home for retired persons nearby , they have gone two days without bread . " We have almost nothing to feed the people , " director Volodya Petrosyan says of his 240 charges . He has issued a desperate plea , addressed to all government agencies , with a list of food items : a ton of butter , a ton of meat , 300 kilograms ( 660 pounds ) of rice , a ton of sugar . The home has a state credit in its account , but only state institutions will accept that non-money and these have nothing to sell , he says . <p> Angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a complex of 14-story prefab concrete slab apartment blocs in the southwestern part of Yerevan . Two months ago , with the heat gone , the water froze in the pipes , cracking them . A thaw sent water and raw sewage seeping through all the walls , into the apartments . Now the stinking apartments are without any water , heat , or even electricity . <p> Shouting and gesturing , the residents surround the newly elected mayor of Yerevan , who arrives to see the situation . The pipes can not be repaired without heat , he tries to explain to the crowd . They lack the resources to even fix the broken transformer which cut off the meager electricity to five buildings . <p> " We are trying to do something but the people have given up hope , " an aide explains . " Even I go home at the end of the day and sit depressed in the cold and do nothing .

Like increasing numbers of Armenians , he is desperate to escape these conditions , even though his parents urge him to stay . " I 'll come back , but I do n't know when , " he says . <p> Others also retain hope . At an orphanage , 49 children do not lack for loving care although their hands are icy from the cold . The orphanage lives on the kinds of strangers - on hoarded supplies of powdered milk from France and kerosene stoves from local businessmen . Down in the frigid hallway , work is going on to install a system of radiators . <p> " We are renovating , " explains director Yelena Gasparian , " so that when we do get gas , we will have central heating .
