Summary <p> Background Conventional treatment for painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy is largely symptomatic and often ineffective , with unacceptable side-effects . We tested electrical spinal-cord stimulation for the management of chronic neuropathic pain . <p> Methods Ten diabetic patients who did not respond to conventional treatment ( mean age 51 SD 9.3 years , six with type II diabetes , mean duration of diabetes 12 6.3 years , mean duration of neuropathy 5 2.1 years ) were studied . The electrode was implanted in the thoracic/lumbar epidural space . Immediate neuropathic pain relief was assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) after connecting the electrode , in a random order , to a percutaneous electrical stimulator or to a placebo stimulator . Exercise tolerance was assessed on a treadmill . <p> Findings Eight subjects had statistically significant pain relief with the electrical stimulator ( p&lt;0.02 ) and were therefore converted to a permanent system . Statisically significant relief of both background and peak neuropathic pain was achieved at 3 months ( n=7 , p=0.016 ) , at 6 months ( n=7 , p=0.03 ) , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , background pain p=0.06 , peak pain p=0.03 ) . One patient died 2 months after the start of the study of unrelated cause while continuing to benefit from treatment and another patient ceased to benefit at 4 months . McGill pain questionnaire scores with the stimulator turned off did not change significantly from baseline scores , indicating that the severity of the underlying pain was unaltered . However , with the stimulator turned on , there was a statistically significant ( p&lt;0.05 ) improvement in all four components of the score , by the end of the study . At the end of the study , six patients continued to gain significant pain relief and used the stimulator as the sole treatment for their neuropathic pain . For example , median background and peak pain scores at the end of study , were , respectively , 77 and 81 with the stimulator off and 23 and 20 with the stimulator on . Exercise tolerance significantly improved at 3 months ( n=7 , median % increase 85IQR , 62-360 , p=0.015 ) and at 6 months ( n=6 , 163 61-425 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glycaemic control were unchanged . <p> Interpretation Electrical spinal-cord stimulation offers a new and effective way of relieving chronic diabetic neuropathic pain and improves exercise tolerance . The technique should be considered in patients with neuropathic pain who do not respond to conventional treatment . <p> Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 1696-701 <p> See Commentary on page 1672 Introduction <p> Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes. 1 About 7.5% of unselected adults attending a hospital diabetic clinic have painful neuropathic symptoms , mainly in the lower limbs. 2 Pain varies from mild paraesthesiae in a few toes to severe unremitting pain in both legs. 2 , 3 Night-time exacerbation of the pain plus contact hypersensitivity to bed-clothes results in loss of sleep , and pain in diabetic neuropathy can be disabling. 3 <p> The cause of chronic sensory-motor diabetic neuropathy or indeed neuropathic pain is not known although metabolic and microvascular systems may be involved. 4-6 Whilst the search for potential therapeutic agents to halt or reverse the neuropathic process continues , 7 current treatment is largely aimed at relieving painful symptoms . However , conventional drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation led us to explore electrical spinal-cord stimulation ( ESCS ) for the treatment of chronic diabetic neuropathic pain that did not respond to conventional drugs . ESCS has been used for several chronic painful conditions , including back pain , phantom-limb pain , peripheral vascular disease , and severe angina. 9 Patients and methods <p> Patients <p> We studied ten patients with chronic sensory-motor diabetic neuropathy ( six with type II diabetes , mean age 51 SD 9.3 years , duration of diabetes 12 6.3 years ) . All had severe symptomatic neuropathy ( mean duration of pain 5 2.1 years ) that was unresponsive to conventional drugs . All were male , and gave informed consent . The study was approved by the local ethical committee . <p> Patients underwent the following assessments at baseline and at 3 and 6 months : ( 1 ) full history and examination , which included assessment of neuropathic symptoms and deficit scores ; ( 2 ) ankle pressure-index with a doppler ultrasound stethoscope ( BF4A , Med Sonics , Mountain View , California , USA ) ; and ( 3 ) vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , and medial malleoli ( Biothesiometer , Biomedical Instrument Co , Newbury , Ohio , USA ) . Motor ( median , ulnar , peroneal , and tibial ) and sensory ( median , ulnar superficial peroneal , and sural ) nerve conduction-velocities were measured at a skin surface-temperature of 33 1 degrees C ( Nicolet Viking IV , Nicolet Instruments , Warwick , UK ) , at baseline and at 6 months . In addition a graded exercise-tolerance was tested on a treadmill with the Naughton protocol 10 at baseline , 1 , 3 , and 6 months . One patient was unable to use a treadmill because of unsteadiness , and so walking distance on the flat was recorded as a measure of exercise threshold . Exclusion criteria included peripheral vascular disease with absence of foot pulses or ankle pressure-index below 1 , presence of active foot-ulceration , treatment with anticoagulants , neuropathic pain of less than 1 year 's duration , neuropathic pain in upper limbs , and presence of peripheral neuropathies from causes other than diabetes ( normal renal function except in one patient who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatinine 134 MUmol/L , normal serum B 12 , no excess alcohol consumption , not on neurotoxic drugs ) . Neuropathy was staged with Dyck 's scoring and all cases had stage 3 , severe symptomatic/disabling neuropathy. 11 All had previously been started on tricyclic anti-depressants and anticonvulsants for painful neuropathy although in some these had been stopped because of side-effects . All were receiving treatment at enrolment ( 8 on tricyclic antidepressants , 6 on anticonvulsants , 3 on mexiletine , 2 on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , 2 on dihydrocodeine plus paracetamol ) . <p> Initial trial of ESCS <p> All the patients were admitted and baseline background pain was assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 4 hourly for 2 days while taking their usual pain-relieving drugs . Ward nurses used a 10 cm ruler marked " no pain " at one end and " worst pain ever " at the other , and calibrated on a side patients could not see , to record intensity of pain . Peak pain , which is the worst pain experienced over the previous 4 hours , was also assessed by VAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus , model 3888 , Medtronic Ltd , Watford , Herts , UK ) was inserted into the epidural space . Five patients had a placebo screener ( stimulator ) connected to the external end of the electrode for 2 days followed by an active screener ( Medtronic 3625 ) for 2 days , and five had the active screener connected to the electrode followed by the placebo screener for 2 days . Stimulation was set to a level resulting in paraesthesias in the area of pain , but not sufficient to cause pain . The placebo screener was of similar size to the active screener but had a disconnected output and a series of lights controlled by a potentiometer to give an impression of activity . Background and peak pain were assessed as before . <p> At the end of the trial period , if there was improvement in pain scores ( VAS reduction greater than 50% ) that was considered clinically significant , a receiver ( Medtronic X-Trel , model 3470 ) was implanted in the anterior abdominal wall and connected to the PISCES-Quad Plus lead already in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external radio-frequency transmitter ( as below ) . <p> Because neuropathic pain can vary daily , the previous week 's background and peak pain were scored by VAS , with the stimulator turned on and off , at 3 months , 6 months , and at the end of the study . Patients were given written instruction to think about the previous week 's " average " background and peak pain with the stimulator turned on and off and to mark these . The McGill pain questionnaire 12 was recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months with the stimulator turned off , and at the end of the study with the stimulator turned on and off . <p> Surgical procedures <p> On the morning of day 3 after admission , a PISCES-Quad Plus stimulator lead was introduced into the epidural space via a 15-gauge Tuohy needle at L1-L2 in a neurosurgical operating theatre under local anaesthesia . Using an image intensifier , we manipulated the lead so that the electrode lay exactly midline on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord . The lead had four platinum-iridium electrodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lead was connected to an external electrical stimulator and the final electrode position was determined by superimposition of induced paraesthesiae to the area of pain , which was usually between T9 and T11 . <p> On day 10 , patients returned to theatre where , under local anaesthesia and sedation , a Medtronic X-Trel receiver was implanted in subcutaneous tissue in the right-lower anterior abdominal wall . An insulated extension was tunnelled subcutaneously round the right flank to connect this receiver to the PISCES-Quad Plus lead . We stimulated by placing the antenna of the Medtronic model 3425 transmitter on the skin over the receiver . The transmitter uses a radio-frequency signal to transmit the prescribed stimulator information . <p> Pain control <p> Both the Medtronic screener , used to provide stimulation during the initial trial phase , and the X-Trel transmitter allowed adjustment of several stimulator variables . The polarity of each electrode could be positive , negative , or turned off . At least one electrode had to be positive and one negative for current to flow , but with four electrodes we had fifty possible combinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be adjusted from 50 to 1000 MUs and controlled the size of the area of paraesthesia . These two variables were adjusted by us . The patient controlled the frequency of stimulation from 5 to 1400 Hz ( the preferred range was 50-120 Hz ) and the intensity of stimulation by adjusting the amplitude from 0 to 10 V. <p> Patients were instructed to adjust the frequency and amplitude to induce strong but comfortable paraesthesia overlapping the painful area . In those patients who benefited from ESCS , pain sensations were masked by stimulation . The transmitter was turned on when there was pain or anticipation of pain . All the patients used stimulation freely when there was pain and throughout the night to have an uninterrupted night 's sleep . All pain-relieving drugs used by the patients were stopped throughout the study . <p> Statistical analysis <p> All 4-hourly VAS scores were added in the 48-hour periods and divided by 12 to obtain mean scores . VAS pain scores and McGill pain questionnaire answers were analysed with Wilcoxon 's matched-pairs signed-rank test . Changes in percent increase in exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcus Pro-Stat version 3.23 . These tests were preceded by ANOVAs when appropriate . Results <p> Pain scores <p> Background pain  --  The median ( interquartile range IQR ) baseline background VAS was 62.5 ( 28.8-71.8 ) mm . Both placebo and the active stimulator improved background pain scores significantly compared with baseline : with placebo , 33.5 ( 15.5-56.3 , p=0.005 ) ; and with active stimulator , 15.5 ( 1.5-31.3 , p=0.002 ) ( figure 1 ) . However , the active stimulator improved pain scores significantly more than placebo ( p=0.004 ) . <p> Peak pain  --  The median baseline peak pain VAS score was 69.5 ( 53.8-77.5 ) . Both placebo and the active stimulator improved peak pain scores significantly compared with baseline : with placebo , 53.5 ( 30.8-64.0 , p=0.02 ) ; and with active stimulator , 33.0 ( 0-53.0 , p=0.002 ) ( figure 1 ) . Again the active stimulator improved peak pain significantly more than placebo ( p=0.016 ) . <p> Pain scores after implantation of X-Trel receiver ( table 1 )  --  8 of 10 patients scored pain as improved ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were implanted with X-Trel receivers . Seven patients were followed up , one patient dying 2 months after electrode insertion , of unrelated cause . A second patient who gained statistically significant pain relief initially ceased to benefit from ESCS at 4 months and the wire was removed , but his pain scores were included in the statistical analysis at 6 months and at the end of the study . ESCS effectively controlled both background and peak pain at 3 months and 6 months and at the end of the study ( table ) . <p> McGill pain questionnaire  --  With the stimulator turned off , there was no statistically significant change in any of the four components of the questionnaire at 3 months , 6 months , and end of the study compared with baseline ( except for the sensory components at 3 months , p&lt;0.05 ) . There was , however , a significant improvement in all four components with the stimulator turned on compared with it turned off at the end of the study ( p&lt;0.05 ) . <p> Exercise threshold <p> There was a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 seconds and three patients managing 3 or more minutes on the treadmill . Figure 2 shows the mean percent increase in exercise time in all but one patient who could not be exercised on a treadmill and therefore had exercise distance measured on the flat . There was a non-significant improvement in exercise threshold at 1 month ( n=8 , median IQR% increase 1.25 4-263 , p=0.08 ) , which became significant at 3 months ( n=7 , 85 62-360% , p=0.015 ) and at 6 months ( n=6 , 163 61-425% , p=0.0007 ) . <p> Neurophysiological indices and metabolic control <p> At baseline , only the two patients who did not respond to ESCS at the initial trial stimulation had unrecordable VPTs ( ie &gt;50 V ) in their feet , and one of these had an unrecordable VPT in his hands . There were no significant changes in VPT , nerve conduction velocities , and mean concentrations of glycated haemoglobin at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline . <p> Outcome and complications <p> Two patients failed to respond to ESCS during theinitial trial phase . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to benefitfrom ESCS with an improved exercise threshold after 1 month . A fourth patient , who gained pain relief initially , failed to respond to ESCS after 4 months , despite continued projection of paraesthesias over the area of pain . This phenomenon of " late failure " is well described although the causes are not fully understood. 13 The lead migrated in two patients , requiring reinsertion . Two patients required antibiotics for superficial wound infection after implantation of the receiver . At the end of the study , six patients continued to gain relief of pain and used the stimulator as the only treatment for their neuropathic pain , all pain-relieving drugs having been stopped . Discussion <p> Meticulous blood-sugar control delays the onset of or prevents diabetic neuropathy , 1 , 14 and ameliorates symptoms in those with acute painful neuropathy. 15 However , excellent glycaemic control may be beyond the capability of some patients with type II diabetes who often present with neuropathy when metabolic control seems satisfactory . Although the first step in painful neuropathy should be to improve glycaemic control , additional drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective but many patients fail to respond and side-effects are frequent . Other drugs include anticonvulsants , mexiletine , intravenous lignocaine , and topical capsaicin. 8 Our finding of pain relief with implantable ESCS in these patients without the need for drugs is an improvement in management . <p> Several studies have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of ESCS for the treatment of chronic pain but no studies have looked at chronic diabetic neuropathic pain . Patients ' selection is obviously important and we were careful to assess both the presence and severity of neuropathy . Psychological assessment of patients is also essential because ESCS seems to be more effective in those without major psychological overlay. 16 , 17 The best results from ESCS would be expected in those with well-localised pain , and in those whose area of pain is covered fully with induced paraesthesiae. 18 <p> Our results demonstrate that ESCS was effective in the treatment of chronic diabetic neuropathic pain , improving both background and peak pain , and answers on the McGill pain questionnaire , throughout the study . The number of patients we studied was small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial trial phase , but it was not possible to blind the study when patients got used to the quality of the stimulus received , after implantation of the X-Trel receiver . Although fully blind studies are impossible , a placebo response is unlikely because of sustained benefit in some patients. 9 , 19 Also the need for accurate positioning of the electrode above the level of pain and with the projection of paraesthesiae over the whole area of pain to achieve pain relief , and the observation that pain relief is lost immediately when there is lead displacement argues against a placebo response. 9 , 19 <p> In addition to spontaneous dysaesthetic pain , all our patients had unpleasant sensory symptoms on walking ( " walking barefoot on pebbles ) , and half the patients could only manage 30 seconds or less on a treadmill . The worst-affected patients were more or less confined to home , unable to cope even with , for instance , shopping , while others could not do gardening , or dancing . All the patients had an increased exercise threshold , with a median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could even continue full-time work . <p> Peripheral nerves in diabetic neuropathy have impaired blood flow. 20 , 21 Because ESCS improves microvascular blood flow in severe limb ischaemia , 22 we speculate that the improvement in pain scores when the stimulator is turned on may in part be due to improvement in nerve blood flow . ESCS is thought to stimulate the dorsal columns ( ie , A-beta fibres ) inhibiting the C fibres in some manner , and thus interrupting/gating pain input. 23 With loss or gross dysfunction of the inhibitory A-beta fibres , ESCS is unlikely to work . This was the case in the two patients who failed to respond to the initial trial stimulation . Elevation of the VPT to the unrecordable range ( or complete absence of vibration and joint-position sense on clinical examination ) may characterise patients who are unlikely to respond to ESCS , and may indicate dorsal column damage in diabetic neuropathy . <p> We have demonstrated that ESCS offers a new and effective treatment for chronic diabetic neuropathic pain in some cases , improves exercise tolerance , and should be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table : VAS background and peak pain scores ( mm ) with ESCS turned off and on PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> <p> GRAPH : Figure 1 : VAS pain scores .
