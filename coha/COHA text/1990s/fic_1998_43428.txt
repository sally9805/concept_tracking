LAURA HAD LOVINGLY RAISED HER ADORED LITTLE NIECE . NOW JENNY WAS 9 , AND LAURA WAS BEING ASKED TO LET HER GO , .. <p> Laura had thought of Jenny as hers and David's-to love , to care for , to bring up . Because Jenny 's motherLaura 's sister , Meg-had been killed in a car accident when Jenny was only 2 months old . There had never been any question about them taking the baby . Jenny 's father , Steve , was a commercial pilot who was often away for days at a time-and Laura and David had no children of their own . So Laura gladly gave up her job as a legal secretary to look after her niece . In those early days , she often thought how nice it would be for Jenny when she and David did have their own children . But the years passed , and there were no babies for them . It was a sadness , but one they could live with because they had Jenny . Not that they 'd ever let Jenny think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Uncle David , and in Jenny 's bedroom , there was a silver-framed picture of her mother and father , Meg and Steve . Jenny was more like Steve , with her fair hair and broad forehead , but she had Meg 's blue eyes and her smile , something Steve always noted when he came to visit them-which he did often . Usually , they knew he was coming , and Jenny would swing on the garden gate , waiting for him . But sometimes , he 'd arrive unexpectedly , and then Jenny 's face would light up as she ran to meet him . Still , when he left , she 'd blow him a kiss , wave until he was out of sight , then happily return to her normal routine . Sometimes , in the early years , Laura had wondered if she was taking too much for granted in assuming that David did n't mind having Jenny . " Mind ? " he 'd said after she asked him one night when Jenny was a toddler and going through a difficult stage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so close-what else could we have done ? " Then , with a look of concern in his eyes , he said , " But we ca n't ever forget that Jenny is Steve 's daughter . " " I do n't , " Laura said , surprised . " You know how much I talk to her about Meg and Steve . " David shook his head . " I do n't mean that . I mean , she 's little now , she needs the love and security we can give her , but what about when she 's older ? " She looked at him , not understanding . " What if Steve wants her to live with him ? " he said evenly . " What if he should meet someone else and marry again ? " Laura knew by the determination in his voice that he 'd been thinking about these things and felt he had to discuss them with her . " He 'd still want what 's best for Jenny , " she 'd said with certainty . " He would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with us . Steve knows that . " Since then , once or twice , David had brought up the subject again , saying he wanted Laura to accept the possibility that Steve might meet someone else . She had no problem with that . If he did , Laura would be glad for him . But she was sure he would n't want to change Jenny 's happy , secure life . When Jenny started school , Laura went back to work , but only in the mornings , keeping her afternoons free for Jenny . Between ballet lessons , homework , and her swim team , there were visits from Steve , as well as vacations with the whole extended family at Laura and David 's beach cottage . Now , at 9 , Jenny was a contented child , quiet and responsible . More like mne than Meg , Laura sometimes thought . Every day , Jenny brushed and fed their big black cat , Thomas Purr , and she took on the job of walking Bonny , the golden retriever next door , while the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laura , raking leaves in the garden one autumn day , watched Jenny and the old dog walking sedately toward the park , and her heart filled with love for her niece . " I saw you talking to Bonny , " she said when Jenny returned . " What were you saying ? " " I was explaining about Mrs. Robertson 's operation , " Jenny told her . " I do n't want Bonny to think Mrs. Robertson does n't want to take her out , so I was telling her that when Mrs. Robertson 's better , she 'll take over the walks again . " She looked at the pile of red and gold leaves . " Can I jump in them , Aunt Laura ? " she asked . " I love the way they crackle . " Laura watched while Jenny jumped in the leaves , her blond hair flying , her face pink with pleasure . " I 'll take a photo of you doing that , Jenny , " she said . " Your daddy would like to have one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this photograph captured a golden moment of their happiness , a moment she wished she could have held on to always . A few days later , Steve came to see them . This time , he could stay for two nights . " Then you can come watch me swim tomorrow , Daddy , " Jenny said . " I wish you could be here for the meet next week too . " " So do I , " he said wistfully . " But you can call me and let me know how your team does . " Seeing them together , Laura 's heart ached for Steve . He hasso little of her , she thought , and he loves her so much . It should have been so different , for all of us . Over the years , the pain of losing Meg had dulled , but there were still moments when it was sharp and new , when she was close to tears at the loss of the years they should have had together . Later , when Steve came out of Jenny 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call . Laura , finishing the dishes in the kitchen , heard him chuckle on the phone , and her sadness lifted . It was good to hear him laugh . But when she joined the men in the family room , Steve looked serious . " I need to talk to you and David , " he said . What he had to say did n't take long : He had met a woman . They had become friends .. . and more . They loved each other , and they were going to be married . Laura went to him and hugged him . " Steve , I 'm happy for you , " she said , meaning it . " You 've been on your own all these years . I 'm glad to think of you with someone . Tell us about her . " Her name , he said , was Karen . " She 's very different from Meg , but I think you 'll like her . " He hesitated . " And I think she and Jenny will like each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura said , but there was something in the steadiness of his eyes and the stillness of his face that made her heart thud . She tried to smile . " Jenny will be excited about the wedding . " David , sitting next to her , must have seen something in Steve 's expression , too , because his hand covered hers . " Karen and I want Jenny to live with us , Laura , " Steve said . " Karen has a son , a year older than Jenny . We can be a family . " But we are a family , David and Jenny and I. She almost said it aloud , but stopped herself . Instead , very carefully , she said : " I 'm not sure , Steve , that would be the best thing for Jenny , to be uprooted from everything that 's familiar to her . " And to be taken away from us . Again , the words were unsaid . Could n't be said ; she knew that . There was nothing but kindness and concern on Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Without you and David , I could n't have gotten through these years since Meg died . You 've given Jenny a happy , stable childhood , and I 'll always be grateful for that . I 've had to accept that it was n't possible to have her with me , but things have changed now that I 've met Karen . " Laura stood up . " Could we talk about it tomorrow ? " She hoped her voice was steady . " It 's ... it 's been a shock . We all need to think . " Later , alone with David , there was no need to sound calm . " We did n't know Steve wanted to have Jenny living with him , " she said shakily . " He never said that when she was older he- " " Laura , " David said , putting his arms around her , " he probably did n't think it needed to be said . " He hesitated . " We must n't be selfish . " She shook her head . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that it 's good for her to be taken away from everything that 's familiar to her . She 's only nine . She 's just a child . " " Yes , she is , " David said . " Steve 's child . " Laura did n't sleep much that night , and , by morning , she knew that she had no right to close her mind to Steve 's longing to be with his daughter . But she did have the right to try to make him see that he should think very carefully about it . The next day , when Jenny was at school , the three adults talked . Calmly , Laura suggested it might be better for Jenny to spend only holidays with her father and his new wife at first . " I can see that , Laura , " Steve replied reasonably . " And I promise that if Jenny 's living with us looks as if it wo n't work , we wo n't go ahead with it . " Then they agreed , of course , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But not yet , " Laura said . " Not until she 's had a chance to get to know Karen and her son . " It was David who came up with the idea of them all spending a weekend at the beach cottage . There was a school break in two weeks , and he could arrange for a few days off . Steve liked the idea , and it would suit Karen , too , because she was a teacher . Jenny was delighted to hear about the weekend . " This friend of mine , Karen , is coming too , " Steve told her , casually . " She has a son just a year older than you areyou and Peter can keep each other company . " Jenny was n't too sure about that , and on the Friday evening they set off for the beach , she was still concerned . In the car with David and Laura , she said , " I hope Peter wo n't be bossy like the boys at school . " For a moment , Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he 's like , Jenny , " she said . " But I 'd be surprised if your dad would want someone like that to spend the weekend with us . So let 's give him a chance , okay ? " And that , she found , was n't difficult for her or for Jenny-because Peter was n't bossy or rough and seemed quite happy with Jenny 's policy of polite reserve . Karen did n't push Jenny either . She had an easy way about her , and Jenny seemed to like her . Karen was very different from leg , but , seeing her and Steve together , Laura could sincerely be glad they 'd found each other . Still , she was n't yet ready to concede that the four of them should be a family . On Saturday , Laura , making lunch , found herself watching the two children through the kitchen window . Cautiously , they began to talk , but it was the cat , Thomas Purr , who finally broke the ice . " Does he always come here with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out in the sun . Jenny nodded . " He loves it , " she said . " But he hates being in his crate in the car . He makes awful yowling sounds . " " Our dog does n't like the car either , " Peter said , looking off at a stretch of sand . " But he 'd love it here . " " Why did n't you bring him ? " Jenny asked . " Because we knew your cat was coming , and it did n't seem fair , " Peter said . Laura , watching them , realized the boy knew how things were between his mother and Jenny 's father . " Your dad said maybe next time , " Peter added . " I think they 'd get along , " Jenny said thoughtfully . " Thomas Purr usually just looks at dogs , and if they get too close , he hisses . " Peter laughed . " I 'd like to see him do that to Rex , " he said . " He 's a big dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was boss . " Later that afternoon , they all went for a walk to the caves at the far end of the beach . Halfway there , the children found a treasure trove of shells , washed ashore by the high tide . " Can we stay and collect shells ? " Jenny asked eagerly . " We 'll put them in Peter 's T-shirt . " The children had already had a hurried consultation on this , and Peter had his shirt off and was spreading it on the ground . " I 'm warm enough , " he said quickly , and there was shared mischief in the look he shot Jenny . We know what parents are . le have to keep them happy , the look said . " And we wo n't go in the water on our own . " " I 'll stay with them , " Laura volunteered , and , after the other adults had moved on , she found a comfortable rock to lean against . The sun was pleasantly warm , and she closed her eyes , conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Jenny 's voice , excited : " Oh , Peter , you found a great scallop shell . I 've always wanted to find one . Can I hold it ? " Laura opened her eyes and saw Jenny studying the wide , graceful shell in her small brown hand . " You can have it if you want , " Peter said awkwardly . " I 'll keep it always , " Jenny said . " Thanks , Peter . " They moved to another rock pool , then , and Laura sat , watching their heads bent together in concentration . At that moment , she knew that it could work , that Jenny , Peter , Karen , and Steve could become a family . And maybe , she let herself think , what David and I gave her is what made that possible . She saw the three adults coming back from the caves then , and went to meet them . " Have the children found a lot of shells ? " Karen asked , and Laura told them that Peter had found a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen said , her brown eyes alight . " He 's always wanted to find one . " " He gave it to Jenny , " Laura said . She took a deep breath . " He saw how much she wanted it , and he gave it to her . I ... I think they 've become good friends already . " " Daddy , Daddy , look what Peter gave me ! " Jenny ran straight to her father , her hands carefully cupping the shell . Steve knelt on the sand as she reached him . " It 's lovely , Jenny , " he said , gently touching the shell . And in that moment , Laura saw clearly the bond of love between Jenny and her father . She went to Steve , she thought . He was the one she wanted to show her shell to . If they were to ask her now if she wanted to live with him , her face would light up . A moment later , perhaps , she 'd be torn ; she would n't want to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . " Will you hold the shell for me , Daddy ? " Jenny asked . " Maybe we can find one for Peter too . " The adults stood together , watching the children go off again to the rock pools . Then Laura turned to Steve and Karen . " It will work , " she said , and she did n't care that her voice was less than steady . " It will work for Jenny-for all of you . " " Thank you , Laura , " Karen said softly . Her voice too was uneven . Hesitantly , she added : " What about you ? " The kindness and concern she heard in Karen 's tone almost unnerved Laura . " I do n't know , " she said honestly . And then , all at once needing to get away , she said : " I think I 'll take a walk to the caves . " She walked along the beach , cold in spite of the sunshine , her throat tight , unshed tears behind her eyes . I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this any harder for Jenny than it has to be . David caught up with her as she reached the caves . The tide was coming in , and she could go no farther , so she turned just as he reached her . He took her in his arms and held her , not saying anything for a long time . " You know , Laura , " he said at last , " there 'll be more vacations like this , for all of us . And Jenny will visit on her own sometimes . We 'll always be special to her . " He took her hand as they walked back along the beach . " I know , " she said quietly . " But it wo n't be the same , David . She wo n't be ours . " His eyes were dark as he looked down at her . " She never was , " he reminded her . " But it 's been marvelous having these years with her , has n't it ? " It was a moment before she could reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that makes it harder now , I would n't have missed them . " They had almost reached the children , still searching the rock pools , and Steve and Karen , sitting on the sand close to them , when David said : " I know it 's too early , but ... we could talk about adoption , Laura . " It was a strange thought , a disturbing one , and he was right : It was too early . But ... " You remember my Aunt Kit , " David said , after a moment . " She and Uncle George did n't have kids , and they were always there for me and my sister . We can be like that for Jennyand for Peter , " he added , as the boy and girl looked up and saw them . " Look what we 've found , Aunt Laura , " Jenny called to them . " Peter thinks it 's wood from a shipwreck . " Laura felt David 's hand tighten on hers .
