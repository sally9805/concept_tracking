Britain has Speakers ' Corner in Hyde Park . The U.S. has an alternative press . But in Israel it is the parliament that serves as the country 's platform for outrageous minority views . With only 1% of the vote  --  just 22,000 ballots in 1988  --  needed to win a seat , the 120-member Knesset must give house room to a stunning variety of opinions in an exceptionally opinionated nation . Its 15 parties offer something for everyone : ultra- Orthodox rabbis who disdain Israeli statehood , Zionist leftists and Arab communists who support Palestinian statehood , and right-wing extremists who want to expel the Palestinians . <P> That diversity can make for great theater , but it is a political disaster for a nation that lacks any clear consensus . For the past eight weeks , Israel has been effectively without a government as first Labor and then Likud attempted to patch together a ruling majority . Both parties ' shameless display of vote buying has reached a new low , discrediting Israeli-style democracy at home and abroad . In his Independence Day address last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political machinations make an absolute mockery of the principles of democracy . " Herzog was later handed petitions signed by 500,000 Israelis  --  nearly 10% of the population  --  demanding that he initiate electoral reform . Popular protest has been growing steadily . Last month 250,000 rallied in Tel Aviv to denounce the political system ; this week protesters plan to hold a mass demonstration at the Knesset . Says lawyer Eliad Shraga , who has been staging a vigil outside Herzog 's house in Jerusalem : " We need a skipper who will take us to the left or to the right . " Otherwise , he fears , " we will reach a state of anarchy . " <P> The electoral-reform movement emerged after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's national-unity government collapsed last March in bitter disagreement over the peace process . Since then , the two main blocs and the handful of small religious parties that hold the balance of power have engaged in an especially crude game of barter . The five-member Liberal party demanded a $10 million bond to guarantee that a Likud-led coalition would stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peres spent five weeks trying to purchase his own majority with generous offers of ministries and money to the religious parties . <P> Now Shamir is trying to form a narrow coalition with the demanding right wing . To woo it , his caretaker government has been raiding the nation 's coffers to build new Jewish settlements in the West Bank , the Gaza Strip and the Christian quarter of Jerusalem . " Our leadership is morally unworthy of leading this country , " says Uriel Reichman , dean of the law faculty at Tel Aviv University . <P> / No party has ever won a majority under Israel 's system of proportional representation , which also perpetuates the dominance of longtime leaders . The candidates are chosen by the party , voters cast their ballots for a party , and parliamentary seats are allotted to each faction according to its share of the total vote . Since the mid-1980s , the electorate has been evenly split between right and left , making a decisive outcome all but impossible . <P> Three major reforms would break the deadlock by strengthening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accountability of politicians :
