Americans have not been challenged to serve since 1961 , when Pres. John F. Kennedy asked them to consider what they could do for their country . He issued the call and provided a mechanism for response  --  the Peace Corps . For nearly three years , I have discussed the need for legislation to create a national service corps . The proposal met with hostility from some of the education establishment and fervently has been debated because it would force a change in the status quo . The opposition is not surprising given the vastness of the Federal student aid empire . These programs controlled $9,900,000,000 from taxpayers in Fiscal Year 1990 . The money is absorbed by administration , distributed to students based on income level , or loaned to those who promise to pay it back after graduation . Implementation of a program linking educational benefits to national service would force reorganization , if not elimination , of the current apparatus . The underlying theme of a national service corps is that " there is nothing for nothing any longer , " to paraphrase a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Americans to decide if they are willing to involve themselves personally in meeting their nation 's critical needs . It would test the concept of youth serving their community and country in exchange for financial benefits for education . In 1990 , Congress passed a scaled-down version of the national service program which Sen. Sam Nunn ( D.-Ga. ) and I introduced in 1989 . Unlike the original plan , the demonstration program contains no link to financial aid for higher education . lt is my hope that this will prove that financial aid in return for national service is an idea whose time has come . The costly failure of the current student-loan procedure is sufficient reason to consider the merits of linking national service to financial aid . The U.S. Department of Education has projected that student-loan defaults will total about $3,600,000,000 this year . Student-loan defaults in 1990 cost the government approximately $2,400,000,000 . According to the department , default rates increased from 17% in 1988 to 20% in 1989 , when , of the 2,700,000 whose loans became due , 542,158 did not make payments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather , the current system works against them . Faced with out-of-control educational costs , it lets students acquire more debt than they realistically can pay off , even in the best of job markets . National service would allow them to graduate college without a millstone of debt around their necks . The grim reality facing families is that , between 1985 and 1990 , undergraduate tuition at four-year public institutions rose 41% and increased 54% at private colleges , according to the Department of Education . Adding room and board costs , the result is an over-all increase of 33% at public institutions and 47% at private ones . In the same five-year period , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , median family income in constant dollars grew by only seven percent , while Federal outlays for student aid increased by slightly more than 24% . The numbers reveal a gap between college costs and family income and Federal student aid . National service would assist all families who find that the expense of post-secondary education is beyond their means . By working in a national service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for a college education at most American universities . If costs continue to escalate , more and more families probably would turn to the option of national service . Such a program would recognize the need to expand post-secondary educational opportunities without leaving students drowning in debt . In addition , the multitude of unmet social needs would be addressed through a national service program of mutual obligation . Participants would gain valuable work experience and greater maturity while performing critical functions in a country straining to meet its social services obligations . National service corps members could help address such national concerns as care of the elderly , illiteracy , health care , conservation , and child care , to name a few . Comprehensive national service legislation is a way for individuals to serve their nation 's needs and earn something for themselves in return . It presents a framework to address effectively the concerns of those who would serve , as well as those who would be served . It jointly addresses the issues of rising post-secondary tuition costs and our many unmet social needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in to fill the void and provide critical services to the needy . Realistically , however , what we see is that a disproportionate share of volunteering is falling to adults , while the volunteer rates of young adults are dropping . We should be proud of the fact that the 1980s brought a pronounced uptick in monetary contributions . Also , depending upon the study , anywhere from 20 to 54% of our adult population volunteered in 1989 . However , research shows that adults aged 18 to 24 who volunteer dropped by 11% between 1980 and 1987 . Studies also indicate that volunteering increases with education and income . National service would embrace an age group whose volunteer tendencies are falling and provide them educational and income opportunities that increase the likelihood of their volunteering later in life . Statistics reveal that volunteers are more likely to direct their energies toward religious organizations than those dedicated to health and social welfare . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , more than one-third of volunteers in 1989 contributed their time to religious groups , while one-fifth gravitated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cut , health and social welfare groups will be pinched further and increasingly dependent on volunteers to ease the accumulation of unmet human needs . National studies of the attitudes and values of high school seniors , conducted at the University of Southern California between 1976 and 1986 , reveal a remarkable  --  some would say sad  --  shift over that decade . Given the opportunity to choose from a list of life goals , the number of college-bound youths who selected " having lots of money " showed the largest increase during the decade . Showing the greatest decrease was " finding meaning and purpose in life . " MOVING BEYOND " ME FIRST " National service is based on the premise that we must encourage our youth to move beyond the decade of " me first " attitudes of the Reagan era and the lingering aftereffects of Vietnam , which have led many to ask what their country could do for them . From the Reagan era , a generation has evolved that , by and large , believe they can have it all  --  without cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national debt from less than one trillion dollars to more than three . The interest payments on the debt have been driven up correspondingly . In 1980 , the last year of the Carter Administration , interest payments on the debt ate up 8.9 cents of every dollar in Federal outlays . In 1990 , they accounted for 14.7 cents . Federal deficit spending is in part responsible for diminished social services . American society is paying dearly now for these past practices . There exists an increased sense of hopelessness and frustration , and recent research illustrates a decline in our sense of citizenship . I find it alarming that more Americans know the name of the judge on " People 's Court " than that of the Supreme Court 's chief justice . In addition , national polling in recent years indicates that most Americans now define citizenship in terms of rights and entitlements , rather than duties and responsibilities . We must reverse this trend . A national service corps could help . Philosopher Baruch Spinoza asserted that " men are not born fit for citizenship , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care and to feel the pull of civic obligation . The American public is awakening to discover important elements missing from today 's society . A national service corps could rekindle our sense of citizenship and civic obligation . Pres. Bush has stressed volunteer initiatives as one of the missing elements and as the means to meet our critical national needs . One such proposal is his " Points of Light " program . I commend him on his effort to bring volunteerism to every corner of the nation through exhortation and encouragement , but the fact is , the program is without priorities . Points of Light commendations do little to brighten the prospects of the 20,000,000 illiterate adults who would benefit from national service corps tutors . They do not help provide child care to working families with no affordable center in their community . Better to mobilize a literacy tutor or day care center assistant . National service would ensure that participants are placed where they are needed most . The President 's Points of Light commendations may be an appropriate vehicle for motivating volunteerism . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proposes a program of mutual obligation . Young people who are working two jobs to pay for their college education or meet their home mortgage payment probably will not have much time to volunteer . That does not mean they are not willing to make an investment in their country ; rather , it indicates they need a mechanism that will allow them to provide critical services while working toward fulfillment of personal goals . A comprehensive national service program would provide an outlet for these vital young people . The Citizenship and National Service Act I have introduced would allow a person to perform one or two years of community service in a Citizens Corps , or two years of active military duty . After completion of service , participants would be eligible for vouchers that they could apply to college tuition or vocational-education training . Critics of linking student aid to national service believe it would target poor and low-income youths . They contend the link would restrict Federal support of higher education and reduce the likelihood of poor youngsters ever attending college because of the delay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Enrollment of blacks and Hispanics at institutions of higher education is lower than their proportion within the nation 's total population . Blacks represented 12% of the total population in 1980 , but only 8.9% of college students in 1988 . At four-year institutions , Hispanics made up 3.8% of enrollees in 1988 , but accounted for eight percent of the total population in 1980 . Clearly , minority access to a college education is limited . National service would open the gates wide and provide equal opportunity to pursue higher education for all those who want to participate . Low-income and minority youths would stand to gain the most , for several reasons . First , by performing national service , participants would earn considerably more than they can get from Federal grants , which average $1,981 a year . This drastically would reduce the necessity for additional loans these youths find difficult to repay . In addition , participants would fill those jobs in which the poor most desperately are underserved . The shift toward heaping huge debts on students and their families began in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all student aid , as opposed to 21% in 1976 . Since 1980 , student indebtedness has increased by 60% , according to a College Board report by Janet Hansen . A new class of " indentured student " is being created . Many in the higher education establishment would argue that we have to work for changes within the existing framework of financial aid programs , that the system in place is effective . In the face of budget constraints that threaten the very existence of Federal educational assistance , what we really must have is a fundamental restructuring of the system . The current programs have basic flaws and inequities that can not be corrected by simply adding to the coffers . In addition to indenturing students we are trying to help , the existing needs-based program does not reach millions of middle-class American families who need help in financing their children 's college education . A Bush Administration proposal would narrow the window of opportunity to middle-income students even more . It would increase the maximum Pell Grant award from $2,400 to $3,700 and reduce the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Administration would exclude another 400,000 middle-income students from eligibility for such grants . Congress did not adopt the President 's budget request and has not finalized Pell Grant guidelines yet for the coming year . The national service demonstration project approved by Congress in 1990 has not garnered Pres. Bush 's full support . Yet , it is encouraging that he has named his appointments to the Commission on National and Community Service that will be headed by former U.S. Rep. Pete McCloskey ( R.-Calif . ) . Under the demonstration project , five states would operate full-time service programs and five others would run part-time projects . Full-time participants will serve either one or two years , while part-timers must fulfill a three-year obligation . Full-time participants will receive a subsistence wage for their length of service . The cost of benefits will be shared by the Federal government and participating states . It is critical at this point that the demonstration programs get under way . This initiative is the stepping stone to a truly comprehensive national service program that would offer an equal condition to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs determination process . It will be the type of program to which students and families from all segments of society can turn . I do n't apologize for proposing a program of mutual obligation . Democracy is the cornerstone of our great nation , but it is not free . For each right bestowed by democratic principles , there is an obligation owed in return . Federal aid for education should be an earned benefit , not an entitlement . Legislating such a program will require a change in our fundamental perception of Federal aid . It is time we make that change . Rep. McCurdy ( D.-Okla. ) is national vice-chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council . <p>
