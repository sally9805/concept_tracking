Medical testing centers have plenty of business these days  --  perhaps more than they can properly handle . Prompted by fears of everything from AIDS and Lyme disease to high cholesterol , record numbers of people are lining up to give a blood sample and get back the good news , or bad . Too frequently , though , the news is just plain wrong . Several recent studies have revealed disturbing sloppiness or simple error in the way some blood tests are conducted and interpreted . <P> Among the worst offenders are public cholesterol-screening programs . Such centers , already a familiar sight in supermarkets and shopping malls in some parts of the U.S. , may become even more common in the wake of a Government report issued last week . The report recommended a low-fat , low-cholesterol diet for everyone , not just those at risk for heart disease . <P> In a study of four public cholesterol-screening programs , published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association , researchers found that only one produced accurate results consistently . The worst program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recent survey by the Department of Health and Human Services of such mass operations found that the " technicians " conducting the tests often had little or no training . More than half the people screened at 71 sites had their fingers squeezed , or " milked , " to draw blood . This is known to dilute the blood with other fluids and produce an artificially low cholesterol reading . Says HHS inspector general Richard Kusserow : " Sometimes these operations looked more like a sideshow at a carnival . " When blood is drawn in a medical setting by trained personnel , such error is less likely . <P> Lyme-disease tests can be inaccurate , even if carried out by experienced professionals . In a study reported in J.A.M.A. , blood from the same 101 people was taken to three testing centers . One lab found 23 cases of Lyme , but the second discovered 31 cases , and the third came up with 43 . The main problem is a failure to standardize Lyme tests from lab to lab . <P> Tests for AIDS are more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a study of 13 labs in the Western U.S. , researchers discovered that written test results often contained misleading information . Several lab forms incorrectly stated that a positive result meant only that one had been " exposed " to the virus . In fact , it means that one is infected . The authors of the report said such imprecision could confuse doctors , particularly those having little experience with AIDS . <P> Stricter U.S. regulations on laboratory procedures are scheduled to go into effect this year , and the Government will increase the number of labs being inspected nationwide from 12,000 to 300,000 . But the task is enormous , and many labs may still escape the enhanced surveillance . So anyone troubled by the results of a cholesterol test or other blood exam might be smart to follow that age-old advice applying to medicine in general : get a second opinion .
