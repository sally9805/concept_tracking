When Metropolitan Life was slapped with $20 million in fines in March 1994 for possibly deceiving tens of thousands of customers into purchasing policies that were disguised as retirement plans or other investments , all of the nation 's 156 million policyholders had reason to get the shakes . After all , if you could be bitten by Snoopy  --  the lovable Peanuts character who stars in MetLife 's ad campaign  --  how could you trust any of the other nearly 2,000 life insurers ? Well , maybe you ca n't . A two-month MONEY examination of insurers ' sales practices reveals that the industry too often preys on consumers ' lack of knowledge of how life insurance policies work  --  an ignorance documented by our exclusive national poll ( see page 120 ) . The result : Trusting customers can become easy pickings for predatory agents . For a look at the plight of seven aggrieved policyholders , see the profiles throughout this story . Of course , there are plenty of honest insurance agents who would never knowingly betray their clients . And in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest life insurer with $163 billion in assets  --  many insurers have begun efforts to stem some of the most egregious abuses . Still , our interviews with more than 50 regulators , current and former agents and other insurance experts suggest that a wide variety of gimmicks , sleight of hand and many other deceptions are so endemic that there must be nothing less than a complete overhaul of the way insurance is sold in the U.S. to restore the industry 's tarnished reputation . The lowlights of our investigation : * Deceptive sales practices are far more prevalent than the industry admits . Publicly , the industry 's stance is that abusive sales techniques are aberrations  --  " the acts of a handful of bad agents in a few companies , " according to Guardian Life chief executive officer Arthur V. Ferrara . The abuses look more like a pattern to us . Consider the following : In October , New York State 's Department of Insurance levied a $500,000 fine against $430 million National Benefit Life , a subsidiary of $116 billion Travelers , in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , the Texas Department of Insurance is considering hitting $710 million Banner Life with an $8.75 million fine for allegedly misrepresenting universal life and other policies as tax-free investments , savings plans and annuities . Spokesmen for both insurers deny that their firms violated any laws or regulations . And more crackdowns are on the way . " I think this year you will see some major companies that have very large market conduct problems , " predicts Salvatore Curiale , New York State 's superintendent of insurance . Indeed , MONEY has learned that regulators in Maryland , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Texas  --  to 25% of the U.S. population  --  are investigating numerous insurers for a variety of deceptive sales practices . * Insurers are increasingly being sued by irate policyholders who charge that agents deceived them by siphoning off the cash values in their policies . MetLife , Prudential , New York Life and John Hancock : All on this list of who 's who of insurance have recently been hit with class-action suits alleging that they and their agents bilked customers for big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . The industry calls the practice churning. * Suits also are piling up for possibly misrepresenting life insurance policies as investments . Equitable Life , New York Life and Life of Georgia face class-action suits for allegedly selling life insurance policies that their agents pushed as retirement plans . Meanwhile , MetLife , which recently settled a class-action suit related to its $20 million in fines , faces yet another class-action suit for alleged marketing policies as college-savings plans . Attorneys representing the consumers in all the class-action suits estimate that the number of victims nationwide could exceed 100,000 . Prudential and MetLife would not comment on pending law suits . All of the other insurers involved in litigation vehemently denied to MONEY the allegations against them . How is it that one of the largest financial service industries in the U.S. , with more than $1.8 trillion in assets , has built a reputation for taking advantage of its clients ? There are three reasons : First and foremost , you can blame the flawed life insurance compensation system that puts the agents ' interests ahead of the consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sell you a policy . Life insurance policy commissions are typically 55% to 80% of the first year 's premium . Life insurance agents typically get nothing for merely reviewing your coverage and ruling it sufficient . Thus an agent 's livelihood and career advancement hinges almost exclusively on his ability to sell , sell and sell . " Agents are under stress to meet quotas every week , " says Richard Sabo , a former MetLife agent now suing the company . The second reason life insurance customers are ripe for the plucking is the lack of clear , detailed financial disclosure in most agents ' sales presentations . Just compare the way mutual funds and life insurance policies are sold : The Securities and Exchange Commission requires fund companies to give detailed information about sales charges , annual management fees and the risks of investing in the funds . But insurers generally face no comparable disclosure requirements . So insurance companies rarely provide policyholders with documentation like the kind fund investors get . " People do n't know how much commission they 're paying or how much they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia Maleski . Joseph Belth , editor of the Insurance Forum newsletter , points out that most owners of cash-value policies ca n't even get basics like the rate the policies ' savings components earned in a given year . The final reason insurers can so easily take advantage of consumers is that the current system of state regulation simply ca n't control them . One explanation : a potential conflict between consumers ' and regulators ' interests . Only 12 of the 50 state insurance commissioners are elected by popular vote ; the others are appointed , typically by the governor . " The appointees usually come from the industry and return to the industry after serving , " says John Garamendi , who did not seek re-election and thus steps down as California insurance commissioner this month after failing to win the Democratic nomination for governor . In October , Rep. John Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , then the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , issued a report titled " Wishful Thinking " that questioned whether state regulators were up to the task of overseeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the November elections dims the prospects for tougher regulation of insurers . According to Steven Goldstein , a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute , the G.O.P. rout means that several activist commissioners , such as those in California , Georgia , Pennsylvania and Texas , will likely be replaced with ones more sympathetic to the industry . Similarly , the switch in Capitol Hill leadership to Republicans makes it unlikely that Congress will supplement state regulation with federal controls . Even if lax state insurance departments wanted to more effectively protect consumers , they would have difficulty doing so with their present staffs and budgets . A 1992 review of staffing levels by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  --  the NAIC 's most recent figures  --  suggests many of the regulators can afford only the skimpiest oversight . Furthermore , 22 of 50 state insurance departments have only one or no examiners on staff to conduct the kind of on-site audits of insurers that sometimes expose misleading sales practices in their early stages . It 's little wonder then that some insurers and agents can bamboozle consumers repeatedly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance customers are especially vulnerable to three pervasive and troubling games : The policy illustration game Agents routinely sell cash-value insurance with policy illustrations , or documents that chart the annual projected growth of the policy 's cash value based on the company 's investment strategy . Yet the overwhelming majority of illustrations omit crucial information , such as how much of the premium is siphoned off in sales and marketing expenses each year and how much goes to pay for the basic death benefit . Insurers can also tailor their illustrations creatively to keep current premiums low . For example , American General sells a universal life policy whose annual premium can be roughly 25% lower than a comparable policy sold by John Alden Life . Although American General does n't disclose this in its policy illustration , the company is projecting a 56% decrease in insurance charges beginning in the policy 's 15th year . American General chief financial officer Zafar Rashid told MONEY that the company will have no trouble meeting the projection , because the policy was designed to recoup virtually all its marketing expenses and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline " is not a projection . It 's a certainty . " Perhaps . But those lower charges are not guaranteed in the policy contract , so the company is under no legal obligation to drop its expenses one penny , let alone by the 50% or so that 's needed to keep its alluringly low premium . Consider what happened to Edward and Carol Benn of Remsen , N.Y . In 1988 , Edward , a 62-year-old part-time real estate agent , purchased two $70,000 whole life policies from The New England through the insurance subsidiary of a local savings bank for himself and Carol , now 58 . The idea was to provide extra income for whichever spouse outlived the other . In the illustration provided by the agent , the couple would pay $33,110 in premiums over nine years , after which they would no longer have to shell out cash for coverage . Instead , the premium would be paid by the policies ' dividends . Last August , however , during the policy 's seventh year , the agent informed Edward that because the insurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple would have to pay additional premiums totaling a whopping $21,408 in order to keep the policies in force . The New England spokesperson Susan Bumstead told MONEY that Edward Benn " clearly understood the nonguaranteed nature of dividends and therefore of vanishing premiums as well . " Benn admits that he knew dividends could vary from the projections . But he insists the salesman never explained that lower dividends could mean that he might be forced to increase his projected out-of-pocket payments by 65% to keep the policy in force . " The fact that the projection could go so far off in such a short time boggles my mind , " he says . " For all I know , they could come back to me again and say I have to pay premiums for another 10 years . " The policy replacement game On rare occasion  --  for example , if the insurer 's financial condition is deteriorating  --  it may make sense for you to replace an existing cash-value policy with a new one . Usually , however , agents suggest replacements because they can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions . As we noted above , this common ploy is know as churning  --  or twisting . Typically , agents play this game by convincing customers that because of inflation , the existing policy 's death benefit is no longer adequate or by saying that the insurer has recently introduced a new and improved policy that will build cash value better . " Replacing and churning is an easy sale , " says Rick Nelson , an insurance broker in Lake Forest , Ill . " The customer does n't have to put up any money for it . " Sabo and other former MetLife agents say that some MetLife agents in many states , including California , Ohio , Pennsylvania and West Virginia , have targeted potential churning candidates with computerized statements of customer 's policies called EARS , for Electronic Annual Review Service . These documents , several of which were obtained by MONEY , list such information as the customer 's name , address and the amount of cash value ( or " juice " ) currently in the policy . MetLife says these reports were designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Sabo and others , EARS reports with juice were also used by some agents to churn policies with cash value . " That 's the way the industry operates , " says Sabo . " If a policy has juice , it 's gon na get worked . " Insurance company officials like to say that only a few zealous agents churn and burn clients . But industry critics contend that many companies foster the hustle . In pending class-action lawsuits filed against John Hancock , MetLife , New York Life and Prudential , the plaintiffs allege that these companies either encouraged agents to replace clients ' policies or looked the other way as they did so . And in a lawsuit filed in November , former MetLife executive Charles Kavits alleges that some top MetLife managers , including president Ted Athanassiades , knew MetLife records showed that approximately 40,000 policies nationwide had been improperly replaced to generate commissions . MetLife told MONEY that the suit is without merit . The Insurance-as-investment game While some MetLife agents ' peddling of whole life policies as retirement investments received tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies dressed up as investments . That 's perfectly legal , as long as customers are adequately informed that they are indeed buying insurance . But insurers and agents may not always be explaining the litany of risks and uncertainties customers face when using life insurance as an investment . The agents ' tendency to gloss over potential pitfalls is most evident in the so-called private pension plans now being widely touted . In a putative private pension , agents typically convince customers to stash premiums of $1,000 or more a month into a universal or variable universal life policy for 10 to 20 years . Armed with illustrations that show the policy 's cash value growing at 8% to 12% a year unfettered by taxes , agents then explain that upon retiring you 'll first withdraw what you 've paid in . Then , as you need additional income , you can borrow against the policy 's cash value via lower no-interest-rate loans . The pitch goes on to state that the policy loan proceeds are n't taxable and do n't have to be repaid ; they can instead be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the magic of life insurance , the insurer has seemingly created a retirement savings plan that generates returns that are absolutely tax-free . Sounds great . But customers are rarely warned adequately that those cash values might not pan out so neatly  --  if , say , interest rates tumble or the stock market swoons . The insurer could even cut into your returns by raising its administrative and marketing charges or by boosting the cost of basic protection . Whatever the cause , you might then have to funnel cash back into the policy to keep it in force . If you do n't have the money to do that  --  remember , you may be retired by then  --  the policy could lapse . If that happens , all outstanding loan amounts in excess of the premiums you 've paid become immediately taxable as ordinary income , at a rate now as high as 39.6% . Clearly , the life insurance industry needs massive reform . Here are MONEY 'S three recommendations : * Require life insurers to disclose agents ' commissions as well as other policy costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a prospectus that would disclose the agent 's commissions and tell consumers how they can find out more about the assumptions insurers make to arrive at policy values . He also believes insurers ought to be required to provide customers with annual reports that disclose a rate of return on the policy 's savings component , if any , after all expenses  --  and show how that return was calculated . * Make agents more accountable for their recommendations and insurers more responsible for their agents ' actions . Insurers should adopt the securities industry 's principle of suitability , which makes it illegal for brokers and financial planners to sell investments that are inappropriate for a client 's financial needs . Also , life insurance managers , like those in the securities business , ought to be held liable for the sales practices of their supervised agents . * Strengthen regulators ' oversight of life insure ' sales practices . Ideally , the federal government should take a larger role in overseeing insurers . But in the new Republican order , that 's about as likely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more staffing to perform more audits , though . The states could give them the funding by allowing state insurance departments to keep a larger percentage ( now only 6% on average ) of the taxes and fees they collect from insurers and pass on to the state treasury . In the meantime , you have to guard against getting sucked into your own insurance mess when you shop for coverage . Here are three tips : * Look into low-load life insurance . About 15 companies sell their policies directly to consumers using salaried telephone reps or fee-only financial planners . The advantage : Only 10% to 25% of the first year 's premiums as opposed to 90% to 125% on typical agent-peddled policies , gets chewed up by sales and marketing expenses . Two low-load companies that sell universal life policies by phone are Ameritas ( 800-552-3553 ) and USAA ( 800-531-8000 ) . The catch : You 'll have to figure out how much insurance you need and decide what type of policy is best for you . If you need advice , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fee for Service ( 800-874-5662 ) or the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers ( 800-366-2732 ) . You 'll typically pay $250 to $1,000 to see how much coverage you need . * Avoid anyone hawking insurance as an investment , rather than as basic death protection . Remember that unlike with mutual funds , an insurer can seriously erode your return  --  and increase its profits  --  by sharply increasing the policy 's expenses without first informing you . " Life insurance works well as a way to guarantee a death benefit that can be used to replace income when someone dies , " sums up Mark White , president of San Diego-based Direct Insurance Services . " But using it as an investment is very risky . " Demand more information about where your premium goes and how the policy works . Ask the salesman how much commission he stands to pocket on the policy in the first year and subsequent years . Then inquire whether there is a lower-commission version of the policy you 're considering . Also , ask the agent whether the policy contains any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent balks at answering such questions , look for one who will be candid . Life insurance is too important to buy with your eyes closed and your wallet open . <p>
