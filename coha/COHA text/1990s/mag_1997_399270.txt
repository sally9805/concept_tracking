// ONE OF NATURE 'S OWN ANTIOXIDANTS , the soybean or " miracle bean , " may be one of the most important foods you add to your diet . Soybeans and soy-based products have been shown to fight chronic illnesses including heart disease and cancer , lower blood cholesterol levels , combat digestive problems and provide a genuine alternative to meat for a healthier diet . The soybean is the only vegetable food source known to be a complete protein-that is , it contains all eight of the amino acids essential to humans in order to survive and maintain good health . Soybeans are also higher in protein than other legumes-about 35 to 38 percent of the calories in soybeans are derived from protein compared to 20 to 30 percent in most other beans . Soyfood is also rich in B vitamins and calcium and is an excellent source of vegetable oil and fiber . Soybean oil is rich in linoleic and linolenic fatty acids , two of the polyunsaturated fatty acids considered vital to human health . Soybeans contain all three " macronutrients " the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fat , as well as dietary fiber , vitamins and minerals such as calcium , folic acid and iron . Its amino acid pattern is equivalent in quality to those in meat , milk and eggs . Experts say soybeans contain 1.5 times as much protein as cheese , twice as much as meat or fish , three times as much as eggs and 11 times as much as cow 's milk . Researchers believe that soybeans inhibit free radical damage and enhance the cells ' defenses against aging and age-related diseases . In a study conducted by Dr. Denham Harman , professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska and the father of the free radical theory of aging , laboratory animals that consumed soybean protein drastically reduced free-radical damage to their cells , more so than animals fed casein , a dairy protein . In addition , the animals that ate soybean protein extended their life spans by 13 percent . SOYBEAN ISOFLAVONES AND CANCER Isoflavones are plant estrogens that are chemically structured like estrogen , and when they link to receptors awaiting estrogen bonds , they block the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a weaker estrogen that functions as an anti-estrogen . Two primary isoflavones in soybeans are genistein and diadzein . Isoflavones may prove beneficial for victims of osteoporosis , the disease where calcium is leached from the bones , making them brittle . Osteoporosis affects more women than men , especially after menopause . Women naturally have smaller bone mass than men and can lose as much as 15 to 50 percent of mass in the first 10 years after menopause . In 1990 there were more than one million hip fractures worldwide , twothirds of which were suffered by women . Calcium is critical for bone strength , yet the amount of calcium-rich foods you eat is not as vital as how much of the calcium your bones retain . If your protein intake is too high , you lose too much calcium . This situation is particularly noticeable in countries where high amounts of animal protein are consumed . Those countries also happen to have the highest number of hip fractures , a measure of bone weakness and a common result of osteoporosis . The body readily absorbs calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . For example , one-half cup cooked soybeans provides 88 mg of calcium with approximately 30 to 40 percent of the calcium being absorbed . Soymilk contains about 80 mg per cup and many calcium-fortified soy milks are now available , containing between 200 to 300 mg of calcium per cup . Soybean protein also causes less calcium to be lost in the urine . In addition , its isoflavones , both genistein and diadzein , may inhibit bone reabsorption , the tendency of the body to steal calcium from the bones for other uses if it 's not getting adequate amounts from food sources . More than 30 studies have confirmed the ability of soybean isoflavones , such as genistein , to prevent cancer cell growth , especially breast cancer . Isoflavones work against cancer in two ways , as antioxidants and as antimutagens , preventing cell mutations which become malignancies . They mimic estrogen , binding to estrogen receptors and tricking the body into making less actual estrogen . According to Dr. Stephen Barnes , professor of pharmacology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Japanese women ( who eat beans regularly ) have only one-fourth as many instances of breast cancer as American women whose soyfood consumption is extremely low . Genistein prevents estrogen from causing malignant changes in breast tissue . This phenomenon is seen in both peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women . Some of genistein 's potent anti-cancer effects are : interfering with cancer activity at every stage , including breast , colon , lung , prostate , skin and blood ( leukemia ) cancers acting as anti-estrogens by competing with human estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors reducing plaque buildup in artery walls and reducing risk of heart attack , stroke and atherosclerosis interfering with activity of enzymes which are involved in controlling cell growth and regulation increasing the effectiveness of cancer treatment drugs inhibiting angiogenesis ( new blood vessel growth ) which would , in turn , interfere with tumor growth . As with breast cancer , soybeans also help prevent prostate cancer . Prostate cancer , the fastest growing of all cancers among adult males , now strikes one in 11 men and causes 38,000 deaths a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater amounts , the disease is minimal . The estrogen in isoflavones work on men by slowing the production of testosterone , which makes it harder for prostate cancer cells to " feed " off testosterone , thereby retarding tumor growth . Researchers in Hawaii conducted a study , during a 20-year period , involving 8,000 men of Japanese ancestry and found that those who ate tofu once a week or less were three times as likely to contract prostate cancer as those who consumed tofu daily . It has also been found that prostate cancers in Asia are the slowest-growing variety and less deadly than the aggressive forms found in the U.S. Genistein is attracting interest because it has been shown to block the process by which new blood vessels grow and feed malignant tumors . The U.S. National Institute of Health is now funding the testing of genistein on patients with breast and prostate cancers , melanomas , leukemia and Kaposi 's sarcoma-an otherwise rare cancer that is common in AIDS sufferers . SOYBEAN AS AN ANTICARCINOGEN Soybean is abundant in anticarcinogenic properties ; soyfood proteins prevent tumor development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negate cancer risk factors by reducing excessive amounts of estrogen or other hormones , ridding the body of carcinogens . There are five different chemical classes of anticarcinogen in soybeans : phytosterols , phytates , saponins , protease inhibitors and isoflavones . Recently the most interest has been centered on isoflavones . Protease inhibitors in soybeans can block activation of certain genes that cause cancer . In 1980 Dr. Walter Troll of the New York University Medical Center found that raw soybeans inhibited breast cancer in animals by 50 percent and also reduced skin and bladder cancers . He attributed his results to protease inhibitors . Subsequent studies have shown similar effects in inhibiting colon , lung , pancreatic , mouth and esophageal cancers . These inhibitors also protect against damages from radiation and free radicals , the unstable molecules that attack cellular DNA . Researcher Dr. Ann Kennedy of Harvard 's School of Public Health showed certain soyfood-based protease inhibitors , such as the Bowman-Birk Inhibitor ( BBI ) , to bump initiated or promoted cancer cells back to their pre-initiated , normal and noncancerous states . The BBI has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been dubbed " the universal cancer preventive agent , " completely preventing colon cancer and suppressing liver cancer by 71 percent , cancer in the mouth lining by 86 percent and lung cancer by 48 percent . SOYBEANS AND HEART DISEASE One in four Americans suffers from some form of cardiovascular disease , including high blood pressure , coronary heart disease , stroke and rheumatic heart disease . According to Dr. Mark Messina and Virginia Messina , authors of The Simple Soybean and Your Health , soyfoods may play a role in a heart-healthy diet for the following reasons : soybeans are extremely low in saturated fat and are free of cholesterol soyfood protein directly lowers blood cholesterol soyfood may interfere with oxidation of LDL cholesterol . Japan and France have half our rate of mortality from cardiovascular diseases . Research points to diet as the cause of these differences in mortality . Americans tend to eat so many cholesterol-laden food that we 're like ticking time bombs . High blood cholesterol is a known risk , in fact , a major risk factor , in heart ailments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milligrams per deciliter ( mg/dl ) of blood and eat 400 to 500 mg of cholesterol each day . That 's in addition to the 1,000 or so mg our bodies manufacture . People need some cholesterol to produce new cells and manufacture certain hormones but they do n't need the amount obtained from fatty animal proteins . Cholesterol and fat can clog arteries , making it hard for blood to pump through them . When the heart has to strain to send blood through the arteries , pressure increases . If the artery becomes fully blocked , blood ca n't get through at all and can not carry oxygen and nutrients to the part of the body it is supposed to serve . The condition is known as atherosclerosis . When the heart is the organ affected , it 's known as coronary heart disease . Atherosclerosis also involves damage to the artery wall , leaving it susceptible to buildup from deposits of fat , calcium , cholesterol and other particles known as plaque . Atherosclerosis progresses with age , though in countries that do n't follow western diets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soyfood for animal protein has proven in tests to reduce cholesterol counts of 250 mg/dl by as much as 25 percent , according to the Physicians ' Desk Reference Family Guide to Nutrition and Health . Soybeans have been shown to boost HDL cholesterol levels and lower triglycerides , keeping blood sugar at healthy levels thus reducing the risk for adult-onset diabetes and heart disease . Researchers also suspect that LDL cholesterol must be oxidized to cause damage and that the reason French people suffer fewer heart ailments , despite their high fat intake , is because they drink wine that contains antioxidants . Soymilk may also play the same role and genistein is suspected of inhibiting plaque buildup by blocking reproduction of the cells that cause it , in much the same way it may inhibit cancer cell growth . It also inhibits thrombin , an enzyme that causes blood platelets to clot . Overclotting can lead to a heart attack or stroke . Soyfoods may work in several ways independent of cholesterol reduction to reduce heart disease risk , so people with normal cholesterol levels may also benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone will not make a person healthy . A total dietary change must take place with emphasis on soyfood as well as foods low in fats and cholesterol and high in antioxidants . SOYFOODS AND DIGESTION Most soyfoods are easy to digest , compared to other protein-rich foods such as red meat that can sit idle in your system and lose most of their benefit . Some of soybeans 's digestive benefits are : stimulation of saliva , dilution of the stomach contents and longer storage , dilution of the small intestine contents and delay of absorption , dilution of the large intestine 's contents and bacteria and trapping of water , along with a binding effect and softening of the stool and prevention of straining . Long-term intake of too much protein apparently places stress on the kidneys , which have to work harder to filter the ammonia created as a by-product of protein metabolism . High-protein diets also are a possible cause of kidney stones , which can obstruct the kidneys and be very painful . Kidney stones are made of calcium ; animal protein places more calcium in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian researchers found that a switch from animal-based to plant-based soyfood proteins helped drop blood cholesterol in a study group of people with kidney disease , as well as the amount of protein in their urine , which is a measure of kidney failure . Gallstones are another ailment more prevalent in people who eat animal protein than those who eat plant proteins ; soyfoods may even help dissolve gallstones after they form in the gall bladder . Cholesterol is a major ingredient in gallstones . The gallbladder releases cholesterol-laden bile into the digestive tract to help digest fats . SOYBEANS AND WEIGHT LOSS Soybeans can help weight loss by becoming the main source of protein intake . A pound of meat does not equal a pound of soyfood . Soyfood has less than half the calories of meat and is devoid of cholesterol and very low in saturated fat . But do n't undervalue soyfoods 's protein content . Under the new guidelines adopted by the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization for evaluating soy protein quality , it received a rating of one , the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein equal to that of meat and milk proteins . Soymilk , regular tofu and tempeh can contain seven , nine and 16 grams of protein per serving , depending on the brand . Soyfood products are also free of hormones and other toxic by-products compared to meat , which can become a metabolic burden to the body , causing water retention and added stress on digestion , ultimately leading to weight gain . RECOMMENDATIONS In order to reap the anti-aging and weightloss benefits of the soybean , you must make sure you are eating the beans ' protein . Soy sauce or soybean oil are not real sources of protein . Read the labels on the best sources of good soyfood protein like soybean flour , soymilk , tofu , soybean nuts , miso and tempeh . We recommend about 50 to 75 mg of soyfood protein , possibly as a daily cup of soymilk in the morning and a tofu stir-fry dish for dinner . That is what the Japanese normally consume . Remember , to see any anti-aging effects , one must eat soyfood every day ; studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body for 24 to 36 hours at most . Therefore daily servings are needed to keep the cells fully stocked with the power of soyfood .
