Periodic cicadas sometimes called 17-year locusts are not a sign of God 's judgement upon a wayward humanity . <p> A few weeks ago that high , throbbing mechanical sound in the air throughout the morning could be taken for construction on the next block , or for one of those internal combustion vacuum juggernauts for sweeping supermarket parking lots . The sound changed as it moved closer . it changes again now as it moves away , dopplering across the hills with planetary slowness . I 'm told it 's employed as the sound of warrior insects in monster movies . There 's no reason not to believe it . <p> The center of the din was once north and east of the city . It has moved along the trees toward the center of town , then out again into the forests along the parkway . It 's high and silvery close up , inorganic , like the jangling of an infinity of high silver bells . The effect is physical ; the sound presses on the chest like waves of an incoming tide . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual news , reports on it daily . The sensitive and irritable phone the police to ask if anything can be done . The paper does interviews with people who claim they shout as a matter of course now to be heard over the noise , who say that they lie sleepless through the singing nights , that the dog is losing its hair , that the grass is withering , <p> Most of these people are not comforted when they learn that the source of the noise is very beautiful . It is an insect , the periodic cicada , which appears every 17 years in the north , every 13 of so in the south . There are cicadas every summer , of course , providing the buzzing music of sultry nights , but they are not the same animal as this now thronging the treetops . They are an everyday creature , big but dull and without personal assertiveness . Above all , there are never so many of them . These are ruby-eyed , golden-winged , jet and golden-bodied , huge and musical . They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-up toys . <p> A locally renowned preacher said in a TV interview that , yes , these are the locusts incited by God in His vengeance in times past , and though he would n't say they were sent as a sign and judgment on our town just yet , he let his eyes and his voice lift as though to communicate it was a possibility worth worrying about . I know him . He is in this , as in all such matters , ignorant . They are called the 17-year locust , but have nothing to do wit ) the bible 's flying plague . They arose in the Permian and almost alone of that distant flowering of life survive . They sang from tree ferns when the grandmothers of the dinosaurs pawed in streams flowing from the brand new Appalachians . They will leave the ends of branches brown and withered where they lay their eggs , but they can hardly be called a plague . <p> Let 's say they are a wonder whose occasional inconvenience can be overlooked . <p> They have lived in secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Suddenly on a private signal they climb into the light . They shed their drab grub skins and emerge in the colors of jewels . Once they emerge they are possessed of a radiant singleness of purpose : they mate and sing . Nothing else . When they are finished with these activities , they flutter to the ground and die , buzzing like wounded frogs , devoured by cats , ants , mice , crunched under the tires of bicycles , in their millions dying a serene if graphic death after a season of fulfillment . <p> Since they began they reminded me of something . This morning I thought of what  --  certain men and women , artists , mystics , seers , countertenors , poets , pastry cooks : gorgeous in certain impractical ways , unmistakable for anything but itself , loud , barren so far as its own knowledge is concerned , personally ephemeral if persistent as a class , widely but not universally reviled , fixed on two things alone : love and song . <p> I began to watch them carefully in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge and rippling , like a great shout a little too great for the space , even considering that the space is the sky . individually , their music is tragic : a beating of wings against the night grass , a rattle of fury in the teeth of the predator . I brought one home to amuse the cats . It seemed a funnier idea than it turned out to be . The cats played their part , pawing and pouncing . But the cicada fought like an angry toy , making whirring crooked dashes to the window on its shredded wings , kicking back though the mere nature of things would have left him dead before sunset anyway . He 'd held out for more than an hour when I left the house . By that time it had stopped being " interesting " and started being a story too close to the center of stories . <p> I 'll be deep into middle age when the cicadae swarm again . Barring the diseases that come with bad habits , my family is long-lived . I could see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw them once before , back in Ohio at Boy Scout camp where they were merely a natural wonder . They did n't seem natural at all this time , but chrysoprase wonders prodigious with rumor of time and destiny . Next time - what ? Indifference ? Irritation ? Wisdom ? Perhaps I 'll be once again reminded of the splendid and troubling among humankind , only in dreams daring to take the analogy to its end , wondering why we should be so blessed , wondering what power kept them from vanishing when they were gorgeous and packed with venereal song . <p> Photo : Not really a 17-year locust but a periodic cicada  --  " ruby-eyed , golden-winged , jet and golden-bodied , huge and musical .
