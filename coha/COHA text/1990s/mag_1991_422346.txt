Section : INTERNATIONAL Baker sets a date for a Mideast conference , but it 's too late for a land-for-peace deal on the West Bank <p> Dateline : the West Bank <p> In the war-scarred lands of the Middle East , history is written on hilltops . Romans , Crusaders , Ottomans , all learned that control of high ground is the first requirement for political supremacy . When Yigal Rosental moved to the West Bank settlement of Ariel in the late 1970s , it was just a tent village on a barren crest looking down to Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean , just 20 miles away . " We built this town from scratch , " says Rosental , now deputy mayor . Today Ariel has five public schools , a college , 32 kindergartens , a movie theater , tennis courts , soccer fields , shopping malls , a 102-room hotel and an industrial park with 75 factories producing everything from electronics to textiles . And its population will grow tenfold to 100,000 by the year 2000 , Rosental predicts . " You see those empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be covered with new homes and shops . " Ariel , he declares , " is the new geographical center of the State of Israel . " <p> On the eve of the peace conference scheduled for next week in Madrid , Ariel and other Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank may have already doomed the Palestinian dream of full statehood . In the quarter century since Israel wrested the West Bank , Gaza and East Jerusalem from Arab control , Israelis have been moving in to create what Moshe Dayan called " facts on the ground . " They now number 250,000 in the occupied territories . About 100,000 live on the West Bank , and hill country that the Old Testament calls Judea and Samaria . It is impossible to drive there for more than five minutes without encountering a Jewish settlement . New ones are springing up faster than ever before ; using fat incentives , Housing Minister Ariel Sharon plans to double the number of West Bank settlers by 1993 . Ten years ago Sharon drew up the last of a series of Israeli government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab control . There wo n't be another . The settlements , pointedly sprinkled throughout the territory ( map ) , now make it impossible to draw a conventional border between Israelis and Palestinians . In effect , the settlers have won . <p> So far , Secretary of State James Baker has shied away from even speculating about how this core problem might be addressed ( page 38 ) . Simply getting Israel , Syria , Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan and a delegation of Palestinians to agree to sit down together has been daunting enough . But he wo n't be able to finesse the issue forever . Last week Baker reached his first objective : as the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations with Israel , the United States and the Soviet Union issued invitations to a Mideast peace conference to begin Oct. 30 in Madrid . Said Baker : " This invitation offers the peoples in this region a pathway to ending an era of confrontation . " <p> Article of faith : But without a compromise on the West Bank , a deal on any other front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian leaders say the only basis for a peace settlement with them will be the return of all the occupied territories . Israeli leftists say the Palestinians have failed repeatedly to make concessions that might have drawn Israel into land-for peace negotiations . And now Israel 's rejection of that possibility is literally set in stone . Settlements like Ariel are as permanent as any city . Abandoning them-as Israel did in the Sinai following the Camp David accords-is no longer practical , even if the government were willing . To compensate 7,000 Sinai settlers , Israel paid an average of $50,000 per man , woman and child , a sum ultimately reimbursed by American foreign aid . The bill for evacuating the West Bank could easily reach $35 billion , a sum to stagger any U.S. administration . This at a time when an influx of Soviet Jews has created the prospect of what Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir calls a " big Israel , " where Arab population growth no longer threatens a Jewish majority . <p> More important , the right of Jews to settle in Judea and Samaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloc . It helped bring Likud to power in 1977 over a Labor Party government that advocated trading some land for peace with the Arabs . How could it be wrong to settle the West Bank , conservative politicians argued , if it was right for Zionists to carve out a nation by settling in Palestine before the war for independence ? Support for the peace conference is tepid . Most Israelis oppose making major territorial concessions . " It would be an ideological crisis for Israel , " said Yehoshafat Harkabi of Hebrew University . " Zionism has always been open-ended . To withdraw would mean fixing a border . There would be a dreary finality to it . Some Israelis will react violently . " <p> A substantial minority of the settlers are hard-liners who routinely tote machine guns . They have established their own police forces , often coming into conflict with the Israeli Army ; since the intifada began , settlers have shot 41 Arabs dead . But the majority of settlements represent a decade-old influx of young , affluent Jews drawn by government subsidies . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with free land and a swimming pool for $200,000 to $300,000 , far less than it would cost in Israel proper . " They 're creating an entirely new mainstream constituency for holding onto the territories in some fashion , " says a James Baker aide . Vowed Tova Gilboa , a resident of Ariel : " You 'd have to gas us out , like Hitler ... Bush knows there would be a volcano in Israel if they tried . " <p> Losing the territories also would ravage the Israeli economy . Whole sectors , including the building industry , depend on cheap Arab labor . The 1.7 million Palestinians are a captive market for Israeli merchants . And they pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes . Even more critical is the regional struggle for water . Israel is already using up all known water reserves about 15 percent faster each year than the reserves can be replenished . More than 25 percent of Israel 's fresh water comes from aquifers under the West Bank and Gaza . A Palestinian state there could hold Israel to ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pushing Palestinians to the limit . For centuries the Palestinian village of Al-Ouja has been famous for its banana groves , grapes and fresh vegetables , fed by a mountain spring . Israeli officials sank a series of deep wells around the mountain spring that fed its farms . The bananas are brown now , and the earth is barren . A few goats tug at the weeds . " Everything we plant dies , " said farmer Ahmad Ibrahim al-Salah . " What can we do except sit here and watch and wait and die a little ? " But the village is ringed by bright green Israeli farms . Because Palestinians are often denied permits to dig wells , the amount of irrigated Arab land in the occupied territories has shrunk from 27 percent to 3.7 percent . Meanwhile , Israeli settlers irrigate 70 percent of their farmland . Says Abdel Rahman Tamimi , director of the Palestinian Hydrology Group : " No one can accept that he does not have water to drink and his neighbor has a swimming pool . " <p> Israel 's ideological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a sole option for the West Bank- " shared sovereignty . " Israeli supporters of the settlement drive have pushed this concept for decades . Rather than give up land , Israel would grant Palestinians on the West Bank limited rights to govern their own affairs . " For the Shamir government , it boils down to a form of limited autonomy that means letting Arabs decide what they will have for lunch that day , " said Harkabi . Palestinians would direct such local services as trash collection . Jewish settlers and Arab villagers just a few hundred yards apart would have no border between them but would be ruled by different laws , as they are now . The Israeli military would still be in charge of overall defense and security . Israel 's vision of shared sovereignty means sanctioning the status quo , and Palestinians will reject it unless it comes with a timetable for independence . <p> The peace process set up by Baker calls for a period of limited self-government , followed by negotiations on the final status of the territories . Arab observers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty as long as Israel grants them real powers . This entails redefining the traditional concept of statehood . Some analysts say the West Bank could become an autonomous province of both Jordan and Israel , with all three tied together in some kind of economic confederation . But diplomats are trying to downplay the topic . " If we talk about mixed sovereignty now , the Palestinians will be upset , " said former diplomat Mohammad Wahby , now a Washington-based columnist for the Egyptian newspaper Al-Mussawar . " First you have to come up with a formula that satisfies their urge for self-determination ... Then , as they exercise that right over a transition period , there will be no escaping the recognition that they ca n't survive alone , and that the Jews and Arabs have become so intermeshed now , so intermingled in the territories that it is not practical to call for a sovereign state separate from Israel or Jordan . The facts on the ground no longer support that . " <p> The Palestinians have no time to lose . " They see the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It focuses the mind wonderfully . " But the price for a settlement may still seem too high . <p> MAP:Set in Stone/FRANK O'CONNELL <p> PHOTOS : We wait and die a little ' : Arab farmer tills a field near a new Jewish settlement , armed settlers walk through Hebron/ESAIAS BAITEL  --  GAMMA-LIAISON/ALLAN TANNENBAUM  --  SYGMA <p> By THEODORE STANGER and RAY WILKINSON <p> With MARGARET GARRARD WARNER and secretary of state <p>
