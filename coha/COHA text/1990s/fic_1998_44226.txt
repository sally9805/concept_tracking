AFTER MY BROTHER KENT WAS KILLED by the Jarimallos and Alvarezes , I toured with Los Asesinos and lost everything there is to lose . <p> The first thing I lost was my girlfriend . Though I told her she should n't , she wanted to come with me on tour . <p> " They 'll hate you , " I said . " They 'll treat you like shit . You 'll be the only white girl in every club Los Asesinos plays . " <p> " I know how you like those Mexican girls , " she said . " All dark and sweaty and steamy . " <p> " The only reason I 'm welcome is because I 'm in the band , " I said . <p> " Either I 'm coming , or you 're not going . " <p> So I let her come . <p> I 'd never before been on tour , but I 'd been playing for Los Asesinos for six months , gigging around the Bay Area : San Francisco , Oakland , San Jose , Milpitas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks I could slam . We played cumbias , rancheras , and salsa-sometimes a Santana tune so the guitar player , Julio , could stretch his fingers . Mostly we did lousy gigs ; quinceaneras , weddings , dance jobs at Mexican bars and nightclubs where everyone wore silk shirts unbuttoned to their navels and drank fruity drinks and cheap beers . I was n't kidding myself-I was n't big time . I was still in high school , playing trumpet with a band of broken-down old Mexican dudes who just wanted to get away from their wives long enough to get laid once in a while . <p> Except Senor Ramirez . He was a famous trumpeter from Mexico , about sixty years old and fat as a sumo wrestler . He did n't have a wife to fool around on . As far as I knew , he did n't have any family at all , and for some reason he could n't go back to Mexico . Everywhere we went , people cheered when he walked into the bar . They crowded around for autographs , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , and we all knew that the only reason we were going on tour was because he was in the band . With Senor Ramirez on the stage , we could pack a house anywhere there were Mexicans within driving distance . And in California , that meant everywhere south of San Francisco . But we had to play a lot of gigs as fast as we could , because Senor Ramirez had a bad heart , and there was no telling when he would drop dead on us and kill Los Asesinos . <p> Getting out of school was easy since my brother had just been killed . I broached the subject at the Mohawk station , where Pop was fixing a flat , buzzing down the inside of the tire with a grinder . <p> " I need to take some time off from school , " I said . <p> Pop did n't say anything . Someone had taken down all the girlie calendars and posters , had cleaned **30;758;TOOLONG the floors , the lifts in the lube bays , the toolboxes , the tire racks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When Pop finished he popped off the chuck and snapped on the air attachment and then blew out the rubber dust . Then he carefully painted Camel rubber cement on , replaced the brush , and , without looking at me , walked into the office . He took a pen and a pad of Joe 's Tire Service stationery and wrote his name at the bottom of the sheet . Then he flipped the paper back and wrote his name at the bottom of the next . And the next and the next until he 'd signed his name to all the sheets . <p> " Do whatever you want , " he said . <p> I walked around the side of the shop and into the trailer , and I stuffed my clothes into a pillowcase . As I headed toward my navy-surplus station wagon , Pop called me to the lube bay . " How 's your oil ? " he said . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . <p> " Pull it onto the rack , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The first gig of our California tour was in Modesto , a dusty shithole in the Central Valley . It 's the kind of town where tractors drive the main drag , and Mexicans work for shit wages picking heads of lettuce in 110degree heat . The men drink Budweiser , and the women are fat with destitution and boredom . Everyone has three or four cars , but only one runs , and the children race naked through yards burred with foxtails and stickerweed . <p> Before the gig , Senor Ramirez pulled me aside . The air was iced with frozen fog , and dew dripped from the lamps that lit the parking lot of the neon strip-mall nightclub . Lowriders-dropped Impalas and Monte Carlos with their springs heated into mush , and even a pathetic lowrider VW-glittered , metal-flaked and custom-detailed , under the darkest sheet of sky you can imagine . The stars were ringed with light , nimbi circling each like the chrome split-rings of 10.00x20 eighteen  --  wheeler tires . <p> " I am sorry , " Senor Ramirez said , " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed by the women of the Jarimallo and Alvarez families . " He opened the trunk of his car and , one at a time , lifted his trumpet cases and set them on the asphalt . " But everyone knows that your father killed their brothers and their fathers . " <p> " It was never proved , " I said . <p> " Nor did anyone prove who killed your brother , " Senor Ramirez said . " But everyone knows . " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " The matter is settled , " Senor Ramirez said . " I have been told to tell you this , although this you probably know . " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " You are no longer held to accounts . " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " You are settled ? " <p> " I 'm playing with a Mexican band , " I said . " What do you think ? " Senor Ramirez smiled but showed no teeth . It was kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to a suit . " Will you help me with my trumpets ? " he asked , looking down at the cases . " They have become too heavy for me to carry . " <p> " What do you think ? " <p> " I think tonight you will play well . " <p> " Do n't I always ? " <p> Senor Ramirez smiled . " Help me with my trumpets , " he said . <p> I thought I was going to lose my virginity that night , but instead I lost my girlfriend . <p> She was the first real girlfriend I 'd ever had , and a doozie . She was kind of short , but her figure was good anyway . She came from the good part of town . She started going out with me because my high school , Oakland High , held a concert on the fancy side of town , and she liked the way I played . Her father owned a bank . She had blond hair . She went to church with her parents . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't going to have sex until she got married . She was perfect . <p> Claudio , the leader of the band , had come in beforehand to set up the equipment , so all I had to do was play when I arrived . But I got there early with my girlfriend and Senor Ramirez , and so I sat down at the bar . <p> The barkeep said something in Spanish to Senor Ramirez , and Senor Ramirez nodded , and then the barkeep pulled a Polaroid camera from behind the bar . He handed it to me and ducked underneath to stand next to Senor Ramirez , putting his arm around his shoulders , nodding at me to take the picture . I snapped the shot , and after that the bartender took the camera and waited for the exposure . When the photo came , he wagged it in the air to help it dry . He asked Senor Ramirez to sign it , then produced a hammer and nailed the photo to the wall . <p> Senor Ramirez began setting up his horns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flugelhorn , a C-trumpet , a pocket trumpet , and his Benge Claude Gordon model with three interchangeable bells-brass , silver , and copper . My girlfriend settled down next to me in her frilly white dress . She sat the appropriate middle-class distance from me , as she 'd been taught by her fancy mom . The Mexican men and their daughters all assumed I was alone and only happened to be sitting next to the only Caucasian at the bar because she 'd claimed me like a dog protects its favorite hydrant . <p> " Why do n't you pay any attention to me ? " she said . <p> " I 'm paying attention to you , " I said . <p> " No , " she said , " you 're not . " <p> " I told you not to come , " I said . " I 'm at work . I act different when I 'm at work . " <p> " This is n't work , " she said . " This is play . You play the trumpet , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . " <p> I could n't help it-I laughed . <p> I suppose I loved my girlfriend , but I did n't like to be seen with her at gigs . For some reason , I was ashamed . It just was n't right bringing someone to a Mexican bar who did n't understand anything about the music , the language , or the people . Not that I was much better , but at least I knew the music , and I learned more every time I played alongside Senor Ramirez . <p> My girlfriend always accused me of liking Mexican girls , and , truth be told , I did . I 'd never been bitched out by a Mexican gal-instead of thinking I was a Neanderthal , they liked that I was strong , that I was n't a wimpy gringo who tried to negotiate his way out of every conflict , that I wanted to make money instead of wasting time in college , that I wanted to have a big family instead of a vasectomy . <p> My girlfriend wanted me to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the great jazzers , none of whom had gone to college . <p> " But they 're all black , " she said . <p> " What 's that got to do with it ? " <p> " They can play around doing things they think are fun , " she said . <p> " They can take chances , because they have nothing to lose . " <p> " What do I have to lose ? " I said . " I do n't have a damn thing to lose . I live in a trailer next to a gas station . My mother 's a psychopath who marries a new guy every year . My brother 's dead . My father smokes cigars and watches television . What the hell do I have to lose ? " <p> " Me , " she said . <p> I did n't want to lose her , but even if I did , it would n't kill me . No white woman had ever cooked a considerate meal for me , including my mother , whom I had n't seen since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was dating a Mexican gal and ate a whole chicken at dinner at her parents ' house , her mother went to the kitchen and got another chicken , put the whole bird on my plate , and let me tear it apart myself . The father , too , was proud that I 'd eaten those chickens , and he did n't give me the suspicious eye most fathers give teenage men-he looked at me like I was a possible son-in-law . <p> A Mexican gal in a red silk dress sat down on the other side of me , and when I looked at her she smiled . She put her hand on my knee . I did n't want my girlfriend to see , so I just sat there with her hand on my knee , acting like I did n't notice . When my girlfriend went to the bathroom , I smiled at the girl , and I bought her a drink . <p> Senor Ramirez called me to the bandstand after he finished setting his horns on their stands . <p> " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's wrong ? " <p> " Just because we played them correctly last time , " he said , " does not mean we will play them correctly this time . " <p> " Where are the rest of the guys ? " <p> " They are out back . " <p> " I 'll go get them , " I said . <p> " No , " Senor Ramirez said , and the way he said no was strange . It was an instant no , not a no he had to think about . " We will practice our duets together without the band . " <p> Playing alongside Senor Ramirez was both an honor and a torture . He was so much better than me , I felt ashamed standing beside him on the stage . Every note on the register was his and his purely , as if no one had ever played the note before . Very few trumpeters can be identified by sound only-Miles Davis , Clifford Brown , Chet Baker , Freddie Hubbard , Louis Armstrong , Maynard Ferguson , maybe Dizzy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitators , part of the great mass of music makers who can never truly call themselves artists . Senor Ramirez was an artist , and I was not , and anyone who ever heard us play together knew it . <p> But he taught me things about music and the craft of the horn every time we played , and he , at least , thought there was hope for me . One time he told me to lie on my back . When I did , he put his foot on my stomach . " Play , " he said . <p> So I played , and as I played , he put more and more weight on my stomach-he 's a 350-pounder , Senor Ramirez-until I could n't play anymore . <p> " Now you stand on me while I play , " he said , and he lay on his back and struck a note so high I did n't even know what it was . <p> I put my foot on his stomach , then increased the pressure . Still he blew the screaming high note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until finally I was standing , I was balancing on his belly . Still his note sang true and clear . He must have held that note for more than a minute . <p> " How 'd you do that ? " I said . <p> " A trumpet player does not play with his belly and his lungs , " he said . " He plays with the muscles behind his belly . I am fat , and I am old and weak . But these muscles , " he said , and he turned around and put my hand to his lower back , " these muscles are the strength of the note . " <p> Usually I did whatever he said , but for some reason , his no made me want to find out what was going on out back , so I went through the rear exit . The air outside was cold , frozen , as if it were going to bust pipes and kill park-bench hoboes . At first I could n't see anything at all , the sky black and no lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a distant highway . But I could hear , and what I heard was all the guys in the band laughing and hooting and whooping , and I heard the giggle of a girl , the men chattering away in Spanish I could n't understand , and then I heard them calling my name , " T-Bird , T-Bird , T-Bird , T-Bird ! " <p> I started backing toward the door , and they kept calling , and when my eyes came into focus I saw them standing around a woman . She was lying on her back in the dirt , her dress hiked above her waist . Carlos , the drummer , had her panties around his neck , and Miguel swung her bra in the air like a bolo . Claudio , the leader of the band and keyboard player , was snorting coke bare-nosed off a broken piece of glass , and Domingo was pulling his pants up . Air froze into clouds as it pumped from their mouths and nostrils . They looked like cartoon bulls snorting at some matador . <p> " T-Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little T-Bird . I have a present for you . " <p> I retched . There she lay , naked and asking me to come to her , and I knew I should have done the right thing and dropped my pants and gone to it , but instead I was terrified , and I retched again and backed up against the door , reaching for the handle . I swear I saw steam rising from between her legs . My father would have been disgusted with me . <p> The guys laughed and laughed , some of them doubled over in laughter , and even the woman laughed , and I just stood there stiff and feeling like a wimpy faggot . <p> Claudio walked toward me , and I looked for a way to escape . Then he put his arm around me . " You have never before been with a woman ? " he said . <p> I shook my head . <p> " This is not the right woman for you , " he said . <p> I pulled the door open and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barstool next to my girlfriend . The Mexican girl whose beer I 'd bought gave me a sexy look , and I looked away . <p> " Are you ready now to practice duets ? " Senor Ramirez asked . <p> I unpacked my horn . <p> There 's not a lot of money playing for bar bands , even if you are on tour . You play because you love to play , and because you get free drinks . By the end of the second set , most of the guys are well on their way to being hammered . That 's when the bands start stretching out the songs , either letting the rhythm of the slow numbers ooze along , or , if the song is upbeat , soloing away aimlessly . You start getting lazy , saying someone has requested a song you 've already played . Hell , the last set is usually a bunch of stuff you 've played twice already , but everyone is so drunk they do n't even notice . By the end of the night , the band is smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though what you 're playing is sloppy and out of tune and out of rhythm , because you 're drunk you think you 're some kind of goddamn music giant . You think you 're Coltrane or Carlos Santana or Tito Puente or Oscar Peterson . And the people in the bar , the drunks dropping off their barstools and the horny couples doing the hip-grind on the dance floor , they think you 're the best damned band they 've ever heard . You could fart into the mike , and if they even bothered to notice , they 'd cheer . Once you start getting drunk at the gig , you look forward to the breaks between sets more than the sets themselves-at least I do . But if I had it to do over again , I would n't have taken a break that night . I would have stood on the stage and played a solo to the sound of ice cubes clinking in glasses . I would have done anything to stay up there on that stage . <p> During the break before our next-to-last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch on the rocks . Scotch had become my drink of preference in high school , because it was the only booze I could bring to parties that no one mooched . While I was waiting on the barkeep , my girlfriend came up behind me and put her arms around my waist and said , " Let 's dance , baby . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Ooo , " she said . " Let 's dance . " <p> " The band 's not playing , " I said . " There 's no one on the dance floor . " <p> I turned around and looked at her . I 'd never seen her drunk before - she always said she was morally against it-but there she was , all frothy and foamy and liquored up , and smiling like I 'd never seen her smile before . She was rippling and rolling around like a sexpot . If her father had seen her like that , he would have locked her away in the vault at his rotten little Oakland bank . <p> She grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> She dragged me onto the floor , and everyone was looking . The music was jukebox-low , and tinkling ice and Spanish conversation were louder than the speakers , but my girlfriend 's body was somehow tapped into the idea of music , and her body involuntarily rhythmed around , not to the beat of the song on the jukebox , but to some cadence only she could hear . <p> Me ? I knew the Mexican dances . During breaks I 'd learned how to dance cumbias , rancheras , salsa . With a couple Scotches in me , I could mambo like nobody 's goddamn business . During breaks , even during songs that did n't need trumpets , I 'd dance with the Mexican girls , and that was always part of what I considered gig-pay . The Mexicans do something gringos do n't do when they dance : they touch each other . Hell , I 'd have paid to go to a bar where the girls touched me . Playing in Mexican bands was the best job in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican song before , unless it was a blast from a passing lowrider with a power booster . Her idea of dancing was disco-slinking around , an erotic solo performed in front of an anonymous mannequin-worshiper who stood there like a totem pole with a weatherworn woodie . So when I tried to take her hands and lead her through the dance-it was a ranchera-she turned away and wagged her fanny at me . She wagged that fanny in a way , I guess , that was supposed to make me lusty . But that 's not what happened . <p> Everyone in the bar laughed , that 's what happened . And while they laughed , she kept wagging her fanny at me , and the laugh grew louder as she wagged that fanny more and more , not facing me , but staring at the bandstand and wagging away . Hell , her dress had white lace around the collar . The laugh turned into a roar , and the guys did the Mexican whoop , and the women were hysterical and red-faced . I stopped dancing and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my girlfriend kept grinding away at the air behind her fanny , wiggling and wagging and never turning around even once to look at her dance partner , me . <p> I looked around the bar , and all I could see were mouths , open mouths laughing , white teeth bucked out like a hundred heehawing mules , until I spotted the girl I 'd bought a drink for . She was looking at me , and she was smiling . Her smile was sad and sympathetic and sexier than anything that wagging fanny could ever have captured . When the song finally ended , everyone in the bar applauded and whistled and cat  --  called and whooped like someone had just cut the ear off the bull and thrown it to the queen of Spain . My girlfriend ? She finally turned around , wrapped her arms around me , opened her mouth , and stuck her tongue down my throat like a plunger . Everyone started cheering again , and I tried to push her away , but she would n't let me go . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solo during the next set . I was a goddamn star . I 'd start playing , and they 'd scream and whistle and hoot so loud that I could n't even hear myself on the monitors . Senor Ramirez would play , and everyone would fall silent until he was done , just waiting for the chance to cheer at me . <p> There were about fifty thousand Scotches lined up at my feet that people had bought for me , and I made use of as many of them as I could . Soon I was pretty damned hammered , playing like an idiot , missing cues , blurting the head of the tunes over other players ' solos , cracking notes like nobody 's business . Basically , I sucked . <p> But I did n't much care , because my girlfriend was out on the dance floor dry-humping some Mexican dude whose hands were burrowed into her buns , and she did n't mind at all . She was kissing away at him and grinding his groin like a titty-bar lap dancer , her eyes fuzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was n't . I just watched her kissing on the dude and rubbing his hard-on , and I did n't even know what song we were playing . <p> Senor Ramirez nudged me . <p> " Que pasa ? " <p> " Nada , " I said . <p> " She is drunk , " he said . " It is no worry . " <p> " I never worry , " I said . <p> And then his cue came and it was his time to solo , and he lifted his horn , and the band cut , and all was silent . But instead of wailing a screamer or rattling off an arpeggio or a blistering scale , Senor Ramirez pushed the mike aside and stepped to the fore of the bandstand and played a quiet tone , an almost imperceptible whisper of a note . And the band , instead of kicking in when it was supposed to , just kept still , the drummer holding his sticks aloft , Claudio standing with his hands poised over the Hammond keyboard , everyone frozen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing but standing , not thinking of each other but instead focused , listening . Even my girlfriend and her Mexican dude heard the note of Senor Ramirez . It was as if some ghost were whispering each person 's name from a land beyond , and the ghost had something to tell them that would alter all the windings of their lives . It was as if this ghostly voice were the key to all they did not know and would never again have the opportunity to discover . And Senor Ramirez held that note , a midrange G , the note gently and slowly swelling louder and fuller , more resonant , but without vibrato , merely a flat tone as if he were warming up . But it was not warmup , because the note kept swelling , and the volume increased , and soon the note was so loud that I could feel the trumpet in my own hands vibrating , and it was vibrating to that note , singing out its own G , but not its own , Senor Ramirez 's instead , and bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed G 's and ice danced in the glasses , when finally he glissed slowly and deliberately upward , the note ascending through the quarter-tones and the half-tones and all the tones between and upward , the sallow and nasal tone of the gliss unaccountably clear and brassy still , and the gliss rose until he opened his valves , roosted on a note-not even a note but a scream , a wail , an angel 's cry-never before played and never since tried . <p> I looked at Senor Ramirez then , saw him from behind : his immense torso , the veins in his neck bulging purple and black , his tuxedo coat stretched taut and near to breaking across his back , and that note he held and held , and yet it began to sound not like a note at all . It sounded like all notes , every note he 'd ever played in his life and everywhere he 'd ever played and everyone for whom he 'd ever played . From the midrange G to the unutterable cry he now held , that note was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament to sound and music and life and death . His back swelled in spasms and then slowly subsided beneath his jacket as he circle-breathed the note , holding it now for minutes , not only beyond expectation but past comprehension , holding it as if he were never again going to be allowed another . <p> I closed my eyes and bowed my head . <p> Though I had n't wanted my girlfriend to come on tour with me , in a way I was glad she had . It meant she 'd be staying the night with me , and that was a first . How she got her father the banker to agree , I 'll never know . She must have lied to him , the sin of lying less frightful than the thought of me out of town alone . Since it was understood that she 'd be sharing a motel room with me , I even shaved and brought some of Pop 's cologne . <p> But when Senor Ramirez finished his solo , and it was my turn , I opened my eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my girlfriend , at first . I started playing my riffs while they were still going gaga about Senor Ramirez 's cut , and since no one was paying attention to me anyway , I looked around the bar until I found her . She was heading out the door with the guy she 'd been dancing with , his arm around her waist , her hand in the back pocket of his tight black slacks . <p> That 's the way it had always been for me . I was the guy all the girls could trust , and so I never got any nookie . I 'd be their best goddamn friend , and they 'd tell me about the men they had crushes on , and I 'd say , " Resist ! " since I wanted them for myself . And then some greaseball who drove a lowrider or played guitar or dealt smoke would get the reward of their pent-up naughtiness . But seeing her walking out the door , my chest went empty and my eyes lost focus . She was the first girl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else . <p> Senor Ramirez stood alongside me and rocked back and forth , heel to toe , to the band and to my solo , and for some reason-instead of playing schlock , running through the major and dominant scales I usually spun out by rote , bored with the two-change chords of typical Mexican tunes-I went nuts . It was n't a crazy and haphazard kind of nuts but an I-don't-give-a-shit kind of nuts . I felt like I 'd been released from all responsibility and all expectation , though I 'd never had either in the first place . I felt like no one was listening and no one ever would , and it would n't matter if anyone ever heard another note I played . <p> So instead of playing my usual robot lines , instead of thinking about the chord progression and the rhythm of the drum set and the register and 1-3 accents of the bored-numb bassist , I forgot without knowing I was forgetting , I felt the music instead of heard it , I played without knowing I was playing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and my lungs and diaphragm , but from my whole body , as if my entire body was playing the trumpet instead of my body 's parts . I do n't remember what the hell I played . I could give you some highfalutin bullshit about boning the muse , but the truth is it 's all a blur , because I was n't thinking anything at all , not even about my girlfriend . I knew I must have been doing something good , though , because the people in the bar stopped looking at Senor Ramirez and started looking at me . And while they looked at me I looked at them , not as individuals -I ca n't remember a single face-but as a crowd , a group of melded humanity , people moving to a sound that was n't coming from the band and was n't coming from me but was instead just there , there as if it always had been , as if it was not being played but was instead issuing from not only the band and not only the dancers and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the race , but from the combination of all of us and everything together . This moment of music in flux and rippling across the surface of time . <p> When I finished , we kicked back in with the head , Senor Ramirez and I doing our sixteenth-note duet with an instinctive precision , our harmonies not the sound of two trumpets playing lines but of one musical unit , and not even that : one musician playing one song , and that song a song we 'd created instead of played . And afterward , he leaned over to me during the applause and said , " You played well . " <p> The night was n't over , though . We took our final break , and the guys in the band went out back for a second helping of their mamacita . Senor Ramirez and I walked toward a booth , and the people in it gathered up their drinks and cigarette packs and stood up , inviting us to sit . One , a short fat man , well dressed and with a waxed mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramirez what he would like to drink . " El Presidente , " Senor Ramirez said , and the group started off to buy him the drink . <p> " Can you bring me one ? " I said . I took a fiver from my wallet . " Scotch ? " <p> I held the bill toward the mustached man . " I apologize , " he said , and he waved my bill away and started toward the bar . <p> To Senor Ramirez I said , " Thank you . " <p> " For nothing , " he said . " You played well . " He took a deep breath , and he looked at me . " Why ? " he said . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> He cut me a look . " Why did you play well , " he said , and this time his question was n't a question . The way he said it this time let me know he did n't want an answer . <p> I looked toward the bar . The mustached man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He set them on the table and said something in Spanish to Senor Ramirez . " Gracias , " Senor Ramirez said , and he lifted his glass in toast . <p> The bar went silent . Everyone was watching us . When we clinked our glasses together , all you could hear was ice against glass . <p> Senor Ramirez plopped his drink down , and then he slouched back in the red leather diamond-tucked cushions of the booth and closed his eyes and sighed a feathered sigh , a sigh of utter contentment and relief and satisfaction . I let him sit there a while , let him enjoy that sigh and that satisfaction , let him bask in the heat of his shot of El Presidente . I did n't know he was dead until the band came back and took the stage and Claudio motioned for us to come up . I nudged Senor Ramirez , and he did n't move . His eyes were sagging and drunken , tired , and it was so dark I could n't tell whether his skin had changed colors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death-dance , but when I nudged him , I smelled the foulness of his clothes , and I knew that at last his great body was emptied of its spirit . He was trading eights with those among whom he belonged . <p> At the motel that night I put on Pop 's cologne and took a shower and waited for my girlfriend . But she did n't show up . I spent the night tugging on a bottle of Scotch I 'd bought from the bartender and listening for the rattle of my girlfriend 's keys . Some of the other guys in the band had the room next to mine , and they 'd brought a girl back with them . I did n't know if my girlfriend had been killed or had abandoned me . I did n't know if I should call the cops , call her parents , or just wait . <p> In the morning I wandered Modesto , walking through junkyards looking for chrome moldings and bulb-domes and armrests for my station wagon that were n't dented or broken or sun-rotted and cracked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , I bought them all . I went to a movie . I ate sausage and drank coffee at the diner . I yukked it up at the Main Street bar with the locals . I took a swim in the motel pool . I watched some television . A horse whinnied outside my window . The sunset was purple . <p> On my way to the bar I stopped at a pawn shop , and the display was almost entirely musical instruments . I asked the man behind the counter to show me his trumpets . <p> " You 're in luck , " he said . " I just got five in today . " <p> I closed my eyes and shook my head . " Shit , " I said . <p> He led me through a pile of drums and toolboxes and fishing tackle . He pointed to the wall . <p> Senor Ramirez 's cases . " How much for all of them ? " I said . <p> " A thousand . " <p> " For one ? " <p> " Two fifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for Senor Ramirez 's flugelhorn , a Bach with a solid gold bell that sounded like something angels played in heaven , soft and buttery and distant like the sound of a ship 's horn five miles out to sea . That night I was going to play a solo on that horn for Senor Ramirez . I was going to use all the money I made in Modesto to buy the trumpets for myself . <p> I got to the bar early , and from the parking lot I heard the band rehearsing , running through the horn parts again and again until the two trumpets got it right . Together they sounded very good . When I walked through the door , the guys acted like they did n't even know me . I asked the bartender for a Scotch , and he shook his head and said . " May I see your ID ? " <p> " I 'm with the band , " I said . <p> " I can not serve minors , " he said . <p> I unpacked my trumpet and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans , one better than me , the other worse . Claudio raised his hand and cut off the band . <p> " We do n't need you anymore , " Claudio said . <p> " But I 'm in the band , " I said . " I know the parts . " " I am sorry , T-Bird , " Claudio said . <p> " Just like that ? " <p> He stared down at his keyboard . I glanced at the other guys . None of them would look at me . Claudio said , " From the top , " and the drummer kicked up the tune , and the band played . <p> I packed up my trumpet and went outside to my car and sat there , watching the lot fill up , watching the nicely dressed couples and groups of friends walk in . The band began their first set , and I sat in my car listening , thinking about my girlfriend , about Senor Ramirez , about the girl who 'd put her hand on my knee . <p> And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a deep breath and got out of my car and walked right on into that bar . <p> " Scotch , " I told the bartender . <p> " ID ? " he said . <p> " No , " I said . " Scotch . " <p> And he smiled at me big , and he poured me a drink . <p> " This one , " he said , " is from me . " <p> I nodded thanks and turned around and leaned against the bar , watching the dancers . It was still early , and the floor was not yet crowded . Los Asesinos was playing a cumbia , and the couples were paired off and dancing , the men in suits leading their partners around the floor , the women 's dresses lifting to their thighs as they spun , gold jewelry flashing blue and red in the barlight , cigarette smoke swirling in the air above . <p> And I downed my Scotch and took a step forward , and the next thing I knew I was on the dance floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms curled in front of my chest as if I did have a partner . But I did n't have a partner , and I did n't care , and I was dancing . The crowd made space for me , and some of the people pointed , but no one stopped dancing , and the band played well . <p> I closed my eyes , and I listened to the music , and I danced . <p>
