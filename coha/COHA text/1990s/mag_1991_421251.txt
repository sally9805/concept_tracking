<p> HERE 'S SOME BASIC INFORMATION ON HOW CAMERAS AND FILM PERFORM , AND WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CREATE BETTER PAINTINGS FROM YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS . <p> Like many other artists , I often use a camera in place of a sketchbook . A camera makes it easy to bring back images from remote areas during any hour of the day . These images can then be worked on in the dry , insect-and-wind-free comfort of my studio . But , like any tool , the camera has its limitations . The more you become conscious of these limitations , the more you can work with them and sometimes even make them work for you . <p> Most of the camera 's limitations stem from the difference between the way a camera sees things and the way the human eye sees things . When you look at a subject , your eyes are continually moving , changing focus , and letting in more or lest light . When you shoot a photo of a subject , the focus of the photo is statistic , the exposure is static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the problems of camera use ( and their solutions ) to follow will be based on this basic difference . <p> I use a Nikon FG Single Lens Lens ( SLR ) camera with two zoom lenses ( 28mm. - 80mm. and 80mm. - 200mm . ) . It has automatic exposure control ( the f-stop and the shutter speed are set automatically ) that can be overridden . The SLR camera lets you look through the lens and see exactly what you 're shooting , as opposed to a viewfinder camera in which you 're looking at the subject through a viewfinder located away from the lens , thus possibly cutting off part of the subject . Preferably , your camera should have some sort of exposure control setting ( f-stop , shutter speed , or ISO ASA ) and focus control . <p> Let me explain some terms you 'll need to know : <p> F-stop refers to how wide the diaphragm in the camera lens is open . The smaller the number of the f-stop , the larger the opening and the greater the amount of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variable f-stop setting . <p> Shutter speeds refer to the length of time the shutter remains open while the picture is being taken . The faster the shutter speed , the smaller the amount of light that strikes the film . Simple cameras have only one shutter speed . <p> ISO ( formally ASA ) refers to the film speed , or how sensitive the film is to light The lower the ISO designation of a film , the slower it is and the more light it needs to be exposed . Slow films need a lot of light , while fast films can be used when the light is dim . Most 35mm . SLR cameras have ISO settings . SHADOWS <p> One of the greatest limitations when working with a camera has to do with shadows . When you look at a lighted area with some shadows in it , your eye focuses first on the lighted areas and then separately on the shadows . However , the camera sees both at the same time . You will therefore often end up with a photo that has very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost black . <p> I normally overexpose all my shots by , one-half f-stop . I can get the same effect by setting the ISO number on my camera lower than the ISO number on the film . This technique will lighten both the shadows/and the sunlit areas . I do this because I prefer the slightly lighter photos that result  --  I like to get as much light as possible into my paintings . <p> If your camera has a light meter that averages the light in the whole frame and sets ( or you set ) the exposure according to that average , you can get more realistic shadows by framing your shots to include less of the very bright areas . The most common example of this problem occurs when shooting a landscape with daytime sky . The sky is usually the brightest light source ; including a lot of sky in the shot often results in everything else being too dark . If you can greatly reduce the amount of sky by lowering your view , you can get a photo with more workable value relationships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also take a meter reading of the area you want detail in , lock in that reading , and then shoot the scene . <p> If your camera has an exposure control but you are unable to get the shot you want and also reduce the bright light source , you can shoot several different exposures of the subject or one with the bright area and one without it . An example of this is shooting a daytime snow scene with trees . I shoot such a scene at my usual exposure ( one-half f-stop greater than the normal exposure ) , but shooting this way makes the trees look very dark . I also shoot the scene at an f-stop setting of one or two stops greater or at a shutter speed of one or two settings slower than normal in order to overexpose it even further . ( You can also control the exposure by setting the camera on a smaller ISO number . ) This will give me a photo with very bright , washed out snow but with correctly exposed trees . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the snow and trees and then a second one of only the trees . This is when a zoom lens can be helpful . I can zoom in on the trees only and get more realistic color and light . <p> Becoming aware of this lighting problem could solve the majority of your camera difficulties . VARIED COLOR <p> Another problem that gives the camera a bad name is film color . Different types of film have different predominant color . Some films have a very blue tone , some are warmer or brighter . The easiest way around this difficulty , and the one preferred by many artists , is to use black-and-white film . Another way of working with the color problem is to use the photo for relative color information . For instance , if pine trees and a mountain appear in a scene , rather than considering their colors in the photo , you can use the information that the pine trees in the foreground are much warmer and darker than the mountain behind them . Another solution to this problem is to make color notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing is to be conscious of the fact that the color of your photo is influenced by the film itself as well as by the color of the subject . DETAILS <p> A problem that often props up when you 're using photos is that you feel you must render all the details that the photo has recorded . The leisurely pace of painting that is possible when working from photos in the studio can lead you into this trap . Of course , reminding yourself that you are in charge of what goes into the painting is always the most important solution , but sometimes you can forget . If you are using slides with a projector and screen , another solution is to project the slide slightly out of focus . This breaks the scene down to major shapes and color and value relations/tips . You can also shoot one shot out of focus when you originally/shoot the scene ; this will give you the same effect . DEPTH DISTORTION <p> Camera lenses are designated by their focal lengths , which is given in millimeters . Telephoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatten space and reduce depth ; they make objects in the background appear to be close behind objects in the middle ground or foreground . Atmospheric perspective remains the same with a telephoto lens , so the distant objects are grayed and perhaps even hazy ; but linear perspective and the relative sizes of objects are distorted . For instance , I once saw a photo in a magazine of a fisherman standing in a river with a waterfall in the background . The use of a telephoto lens had distorted linear perspective so much that it looked as if he 'd be in the waterfall if : e stepped back less than a foot , when in reality he was some distance from the waterfall , perhaps as much as a mile away . <p> Of course , the flattening of space can be used as an advantage  --  especially if your subject is mostly in the foreground . In such cases , you 'll be glad to have the background flattened and simplified . But if you are working with the depth of a landscape , you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . <p> All lenses distort to some degree . Those that closely approximate our normal vision ( with focal lengths of around 50mm.  --  in fact , such lenses are called " normal " lenses ) distort the least . Cameras usually come with 50mm. lenses . To make yourself more aware of the distortions so you wo n't be misled by them , you can view objects with parallel lines , such as windows and doors , and see what they look like through each lens . ( This is a good technique to use when buying a lens . ) You 'll find that wide-angle lenses ( less than 50mm. , usually 28mm. and 35mm. ) bow lines out near the edges of your picture ; they also make objects look farther away and smaller than they really are . They basically reverse the effect of telephoto lenses in that they extend depth . To have a permanent record of the type of distortion you get with a particular lens , you could shoot pictures of line grids and compare the photo to the original . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distortion your film gives you . Flattened Foreground <p> I 've already mentioned how telephoto lenses flatten space and how this can be an advantage when the main subject is in the foreground . You can use this characteristic to create an interesting study in relative depth and silhouettes if you 're shooting on a partly cloudy day and the clouds are moving . It 's very revealing to compare a shaded foreground and a sunlit background with a sunlit foreground and a shaded background . Photo Mosaic <p> Sometimes you 're interested by a field of view that 's much wider than your camera 's field of view  --  even with a wide-angle lens . A technique that 's very helpful for getting a very wide viewing area is to make a photo mosaic . <p> If you find an interesting view that is larger than your camera 's field of view , you can shoot several overlapping photos using print film and tape the prints together to make a mosaic . This technique will give you less distortion than will a wide-angle lens . The differences in color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you a little bit about the variability of film color . Also , keep in mind that the photos will not always line up perfectly when they are overlapped . Mounting your camera on a tripod can help . Inconsistency of the Light <p> In a very wide mosaic , you will probably notice an apparent change in the direction of the light . For example , you could start shooting with your camera facing west and end up with your camera facing east . The light in the west might be different in strength from the light in the east , especially in the morning or the evening . Also , if you use several-different photos or slides for a painting , you can have seasonal or geographical inconsistencies . In the end , you are the one who decides how consistent or accurate your work will be . It is important , though , that you be aware of the possibility of inconsistencies . Perimeter Flexibility <p> Using a zoom lens can be a great advantage . With a zoom lens you can move the perimeter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can compare a close-up view to one that covers a broader area . For instance , when shooting a scene with trees and a mountain , you can include all the trees and the mountain or only one or a few trees and the mountain . Also , as I 've mentioned earlier , the zoom lens can be used to compensate for lighting problems by zooming in on a particular part of the scene and excluding everything else so you get accurate color and light in that area . Summary <p> Any and all of these techniques can be helpful in doing a painting . But with most of my paintings , when I 'm finishing them up , I find it more enjoyable to work on them with no reference to anything but the painting itself . My primary aim is to produce a good painting rather than one that is an accurate representation of my original subject . The essence I try to capture is my emotion and feelings , not the details of a scene . <p> I 've been talking mostly about the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does offer some obvious advantages in addition to mobility . That a camera is not a brush or pencil should not stop you from being creative when using it . It 's nothing but another tool , and it can be used in your own unique way . And it should be remembered that the camera has been used artists as a tool since its invention . Degas , Manet , Eakins , and many other highly respected artists have used it . As it becomes more versatile and easier to use , more artists are using it . <p> The main thing to keep in mind about photos is that when you 're looking at them , remember that you are not seeing the same thing you saw when you shot them . Your are looking at representations of scenes that are incomplete in various ways . If you remember this , you can use these representations and work with them in creative ways . Most of all , keep experimenting . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Above : Three photographs of Yankee Boy Basin . <p> PHOTO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two f-stops and has more realistic colors and values for the shadowed areas in the middle ground and foreground . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Center : This slide is exposed normally  --  by the camera 's light meter .
