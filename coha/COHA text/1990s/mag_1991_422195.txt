Section : Articles Before the coup , Communist hard-liners blocked the way . Now , anything is possible . <p> THE historic significance of the August 19 coup is in ending the transitional , Gorbachev phase of the Soviet transformation , a phase of reformed and reforming Communism , and in ushering a new historic period , that of an anti-Communist democratic revolution . <p> By August 19 , this transitional stage had already grown inordinately , unnaturally long . In Poland , the first post-Communist nation , the transition took slightly more than a year . In Albania , the most recent self-liberated country , it took nine months . In between , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria , and the German Democratic Republic covered the same political ground in just a few months . In the Soviet Union  --  meaning , of course , Moscow  --  Gorbachev 's transitional regime of a benign one-party dictatorship with a human face , a sort of Moscow Spring , had lasted for six years and four months ! <p> It ended with a giant shift of the entire Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political discourse , or from left to right in the lexicon of the rest of the world . The result will be a massive and , at long last , truly revolutionary redistribution of power : from the center to the Republics and from the extra-legal Party  --  government structures to the newly empowered self-governing bodies . <p> This shift is now possible because the coup has obliterated a key fixture of the Soviet political cosmos . For the last six years , Soviet politics have been transacted on the margin of the giant black hole called the Communist Right . ' As with its counterpart in astronomy , this political black hole was invisible but assumed to have enormous mass . As Gorbachev navigated his space ship Perestroika in the dark sky of Soviet politics , he justified his zigzagging and backtracking course by the fear of trespassing the black hole and crushing the whole enterprise . First inside the country but , of late , largely in the West this explanation has been sufficient to justify the increasingly erratic course of Captain Gorbachev . <p> Now the black hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed but revealed to be  --  and , perhaps , to have been all along  --  a rather paltry , ordinary star of less than average gravitational force . Redrawing the Charts <p> Most immediately , the consequences of this reconfiguration of the Soviet political firmament will be felt in the fate of the Union . As in February 1917 , a democratic revolution necessarily causes the breakup of the domestic empire . While for tens of millions of former Soviet subjects this deliverance is by far the most joyful event of their lives , one should beware of the Western liberal intelligentsia , especially its mass-media and academic branches , who are likely to present their fellow citizens and decision-makers with a decidedly less optimistic portrait of a disintegrating USSR . ( This is hardly surprising , since the Soviet breakup is fueled by nationalism , capitalism , and anti-Communism  --  the three political and economic phenomena Western liberal intellectuals detest the most . ) <p> At the moment , the horror scenarios have four major variations , often mixed for a stronger effect . <p> Violence . The Serbo-Croatian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments . But the example is spurious for two reasons . First , the sort of intense , centuries-old hatred that obtains between the Serbs and Croats exists in the former Soviet Union only between two peoples , the Armenians and Azerbaijanis . While a protracted conflict there seems inevitable , it is likely to be sluggish , low tech , on again , off again , involving a total of no more than ten million people  --  a far cry from a bloodbath ' that , we are told , is about to engulf the country of 270 million . <p> Second , democracies very rarely fight . The key to the Serbian intransigence is hard-line Communists still in power . Of the 15 Republics of the Soviet Union , seven have decidedly anti-Communist , democratically elected governments ( Armenia , Estonia , Georgia , Latvia , Lithuania , Moldova , and Russia ) and two have reformed Communists in power ( Kazakhstan , Ukraine ) . Thus the danger of Communists attempting to extend their political life by cloaking themselves in nationalist banners and precipitating violence exists only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Uzbekistan . While bloody conflicts have erupted in Central Asia  --  particularly , in the last three years , between the Kirgiz and the Uzbeks  --  and will undoubtedly be repeated , they are too localized and sporadic to qualify as a bloodbath . ' <p> Finally , we might note that , in February 1917 , in a situation remarkably similar to the one obtaining today , the empire fell apart with remarkably little bloodshed . The blood was spilled later when the Bolsheviks began putting the empire back together . <p> The Nuclear Menace . First , even if the newly emergent states wanted to keep nuclear weapons deployed on their territory , they would not know what to do with them : their arming , targeting , and launching was never in the purview of local commanders . More importantly , the three nations which , in addition to Russia , have nuclear weapons on their territory ( Kazakhstan , Byelorussia , and Ukraine ) all have declared their desire to get rid of any and all nuclear material on their territory . Ukraine declared itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Economic Non-Viability . As the Estonians like to point out to Western visitors , in 1940 , before they were forced into the Soviet Union , their standard of living was twice as high as that of neighboring Finland . Now it is a fourth as high . Finland , itself a former Russian province , is a good example of this unexpected viability ' ' : devoid of oil , natural gas , and coal , and short on all other raw materials with the exception of timber , this former Russian province has become a solid , middle-range European economy . <p> What is true of the three Baltic Republics is a fortiori true of such immensely rich countries as Russia , Ukraine , and Kazakhstan , and of such entrepreneurially minded peoples as the Georgians , Moldovans , and Armenians , all blessed with wonderfully benign climates and , in the Armenian case , with a wealthy and fervently patriotic expatriate community in the West . <p> The only region in the former Soviet Union that is in for truly hard economic times is Central Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a miserable standard of living , a third to a fifth that of the Soviet Union as a whole ; a monocultural economy ( cotton ) ; a disastrous environmental situation ; unemployment ; and an astronomical birthrate . Even here , however , the withdrawal of Moscow 's subsidies , which will be very painful in the short run , will eventually be more than made up for by the rehabilitation of the cotton fields and their return to food production . <p> Yet even if the newly created states did not prove economically viable , ' what would this matter ? Hard as it might be for the West to understand , there are moments in peoples ' history when they are run not by the accountants ' logic but by passions . The decades-long dream of regaining national dignity and statehood by getting as far away as possible from a bloody , primitive , corrupt , and economically collapsing colonial empire is not likely to be tarnished , much less diminished , by expectations of economic difficulties . History has yet to produce a single example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its former colonial metropolis because of unanticipated hardships . <p> Russian Imperialism . The most significant , albeit little noticed , political process to have taken place in the Soviet Union in the last three years was the separation of Russian nationalism from Russian imperialism . The amazing nonchalance with which most Russians have been reacting to the growing independence of the Republics culminated , in January 1990 , in mass protests against the call-up of ethnic Russian reservists to pacify Azerbaijan . Contrary to decades of punditry , the Russians were not willing to die for the empire . Once the draft was called off , the end of the empire was in sight . The Test of Power <p> The only true test of a politician is the test of power . There is a slim but real possibility that , like Lenin before him , Yeltsin , who in opposition called for the right to secede , may , while in power , try to recreate the empire . Yet his entire record as the Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet and then President of Russia makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated the creation of a voluntary horizontal ' Union of equal states ( as opposed to what he called Gorbachev 's vertical ' structure , in which Moscow 's power would continue to predominate ) and has concluded economic and political treaties between Russia and all the other 14 Republics . It was Yeltsin who a year ago in Tatarstan enunciated the famous formula of granting all nationalities of the Soviet Union as much autonomy as they can handle . ' And it was Yeltsin who on the morning of January 13 , hours after Moscow-directed black berets ' shot their way into the television tower in Vilnius , flew to Tallinn to re-affirm his support for Baltic independence . <p> After its impact on the Union , the strongest impact of the coup is likely to be on the relationship between the two key dramatis personae of this magnificent spectacle . Since the Novo-Ogariovo agreement of April 23 , but especially since Yeltsin 's victory in the Russian presidential election on June 13 , there was already in high Soviet politics a de-facto power-sharing , a kind of Gorbachev  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the entire dynamic of that relationship has shifted  --  with power lines going not from Gorbachev to Yeltsin but in the other direction . <p> The coup did more than shellshock Gorbachev . It divested him of a key prop . For Gorbachev 's political brilliance was a high-wire act between the two poles . Now that one of the poles has collapsed so dramatically , can the act continue at all ? <p> Will Gorbachev agree to a much weakened presidency ? Or will he stubbornly attempt to regain the powers that he feels are rightfully his ? If he persists in the latter , his days are numbered . If he accepts history 's verdict , he may be rewarded with the largely ceremonial presidency of a much weakened Supreme Soviet , which is likely to become similar to the European Parliament . <p> For Yeltsin , the key gain of the coup was not increased popularity at home . That he had in spades already . It may not even be the dramatic increase in power . His key gain is the strides he has made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : international recognition . Now , it seems , the West finally  --  and , in the case of the elite media and political establishments , reluctantly  --  is coming to realize what the 150 million Russians have known for at least four years : namely , that , alone among Soviet leaders , Yeltsin has enough of the people 's trust to lead them through a very complicated transition to democracy and a market economy . <p> Cartoon : Peter Steiner , reprinted with permission . <p> By Leon Aron <p> <p> Mr. Aron is Salvatori Senior Policy Analyst in Soviet Studies at the Heritage Foundation .
