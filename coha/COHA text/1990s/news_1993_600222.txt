<p> DES MOINES Iowa 's six-on-six girls basketball tradition has been passed along from mother to daughter like heirloom jewelry . <p> Now , Iowa girls are putting the game aside for the five-on-five version the rest of the world plays , and much of the state feels it 's trading genuine pearls for plastic . <p> Though they might be divided on the wisdom of making the switch , Iowans are universally nostalgic and proud of the game 's pioneering role in women 's athletics . It long ago eclipsed boys hoops in popularity , drawing sellout crowds of 12,000 to the annual state tournament in Des Moines . <p> " I grew up , a girl , never thinking that I could n't accomplish what I wanted to , " said Lynne Lorenzen , who led Ventura to a state title in 1987 and amassed 6,736 points to become Iowa 's all-time schoolgirl scoring champion . <p> Her mother , Frances Billerbeck , helped win a championship for Reinbeck in 1952 , and Lorenzen grew up daydreaming over her mom 's scrapbook . <p> This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which features a don't-cross-me half-court line , a two-dribble rule and rapid-fire scoring . A similar game is still played in Oklahoma and parts of Texas . <p> Schools have been switching to five-on-five in growing numbers and , last February , the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union decided to phase out six-on-six in 1993-94 . Now even that tournament appears jeopardized : not enough teams will be playing six-on-six . <p> The uncertainty has turned this year 's pilgrimage to Des Moines into a noisy , colorful wake . " I 'm heartbroken , I really am , " said Julie Bergeson of Hubbard , whose daughter , Stacie , plays guard for Hubbard-Radcliffe High . <p> " I 'd be the perfect person to go on a talk show and say , " I 'm reliving my dreams through my daughter , ' " said Bergeson , who played ball at Radcliffe , 7 miles away , before the schools merged . " We never even got close . " <p> Stacie , a 6-1 junior , is one of thousands of girls who are unsure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to rebound , block and steal , not shoot . <p> " I 'll go out . I do n't know if I 'll play , " she said . <p> Hubbard-Radcliffe 's Lady Rebels adhered to their usual superstitions before their first tournament game Tuesday , painting their left index fingernails scarlet and making sure coach Les Hueser , a 39-year veteran who has coached three daughters and a granddaughter , wore his red socks with the holes . They do n't seem nearly as worried about the future as their moms and grandmoms . <p> " A lot of us could have played five-on-five , " said 5-10 senior forward Lisa Brinkmeyer , who averaged 40.2 points a game this season and will attend Drake University this fall . " We 'll miss six-on-six , but I think it 'll be a nice change . " <p> Susan Weddingfeld , a 6-0 junior forward for Panorama High , said she thinks five-on-five will be fun . <p> " I do n't mind switching I just wish it was n't my senior year , " she said after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pop . 1,211 ) . <p> But in Tuesday 's first round , Panorama just missed bumping off defending state champion Osage , losing 60-59 . Weddingfeld scored 31 points . <p> In the short run , Athletic Union officials expect a drop in attendance and revenues . Six-on-six outdraws the other game by nearly 40% . <p> Hubbard and Radcliffe , with a combined population of 1,600 , snapped up 1,204 tournament tickets . Schools and businesses were shuttered Tuesday . Cedar Rapids Jefferson , drawing on a community of 110,243 , sent a team to the five-on-five tournament and sold 117 tickets . <p> The change also will cost Iowa some coaches . Panorama 's Bud McCrea , who brought nine teams to Des Moines in his 25-year career , said he 'll quit rather than start over at age 55 . <p> " You can call this change , you can call it the ' 90s , but do n't call it progress , " said McCrea , who fears the switch will hurt small schools more . <p> E. Wayne Cooley , 71 , Athletic Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge that awaits . <p> " I think we can pull it together , " Cooley said . " We may not reach the zenith we have now , but we wo n't be destitute . We want to offer a quality game , and if we work properly with clinics and camps , we 'll have one . " <p> The original impetus for five-on-five came from girls and their parents who felt the old game denied them an equal shot at athletic scholarships . Some six-on-six players , mainly forwards , reached major college programs anyway , including Nebraska star Karen Jennings of Neola Tri-Center High . <p> " I have a lot of respect for the game , " Jennings said . " It allows girls to develop fundamental skills , especially offensively . But I really think it 's time for the six-person game to go . " <p> Jan Jensen , a six-on-six standout from Elk Horn-Kimballton who is an assistant coach at Drake , said the change will make it easier for recruiters to evaluate Iowa talent . <p> " What you hear is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jensen , 24 . " You wo n't have the mystique and the Cinderella stories of the small rural towns being stars on March 13 . That 's what people are holding onto . " <p> Jensen will put on the glass slipper Saturday when she enters the Iowa Girls Basketball Hall of Fame . Also on hand : her 90-year-old grandmother , Dorcas Anderson Randolph , a member of the ' 21 state champion Audubon squad and Hall of Famer . <p> Lorenzen , who also will be inducted , has a wish for Iowa girls who 'll now be able to dribble as much as they want in her wake : " The gyms are full now . I hope they stay full . " <p> How six-on-six basketball works : <p> This might be the last year for six-on-six basketball . The biggest difference is in how the six-player teams are restricted on the court : Each half court has three forwards ( offensive ) and three guards ( defensive ) . There are no centers . Players can not cross ( or touch ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the basket they 're shooting at ( the " forward court " ) ; guards stay on the side where the opposite team is shooting ( the " guard court " ) . A violation results in a turnover . Beyond that , players are allowed to move anywhere they wish within the half-court . <p> Two officials are assigned to work each game . After one team scores , the official retrieves the ball and passes it upcourt to the second official . <p> Players are allowed no more than two dribbles before they have to pass . They can hold the ball for three seconds . When a forward has the ball , guards can not slap at it or reach in and try to steal it unless both players are in the paint , or key ( the colored area underneath and in front of the basket ) . Ball is the same size used by college women 's teams . <p> OTHER RULES : Teams play four eight-minute quarters . In the event of a tie , they play a 3-minute overtime . Maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to switch a forward to the guard position called a " change of court . " Each player can be switched a maximum of four times . After a free-throw , a guard retrieves the ball and inbounds it . There is no shot clock . There are no jump balls . Teams alternate possession when the ball is tied up . Players foul out on the sixth foul .
