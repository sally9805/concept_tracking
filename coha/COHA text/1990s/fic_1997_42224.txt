After a decade of living in Atlanta , Ava Johnson tests positive for HIV . She has come home to tiny Idlewild , Michigan , to spend a quiet summer with her sister . There she renews an old friendship and relizes that what she thought was an ending may well be a new beginning . An excerpt from the new novel BY PEARL CLEAGE <p> THE DREAM I dreamed about walking in Eddie 's garden . I 'm wearing a long white dress , and I 've got this big-ass straw hat , and I 'm holding my skirt so it won'tget dirty . Eddie 's walking right in front of me , telling me what he planted and when it 's coming up . Neither one of us has any shoes on , and the dirt is soft and warm and moist without being squishy . He stops to show me a new kind of tomato he 's planted this year for the first time . I 'm surprised to see that it is perfectly golden and not red at all like the other tomatoes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold four or five in his hand like candy . I take one and pop it into my mouth , savoring the warm sweetness , and I drop my skirt to reach for another , and the wind catches it and lifts me up like wings , and I hold his hand and his hair lifts him up like wings , too , and all I hear is the sound of the wind and the sound of our laughter , and then he leans over and tells me the name of the golden tomatoes . " Yellow Plum , " he says into my ear . " They 're Yellow Plum . " And then I woke up . THE FACTS By the time I got to Eddie 's that evening , I had figured out how I was going to tell him . I was just going to say it all at once and then leave , so he could have some time to think . That way , if the whole idea of our moving to the next level made him nervous , he could just write me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it in his eyes . I could n't take that again . The house was full of candles even though it was just getting dark , and the smell of incense was drifting out of the open door . Eddie was playing Marvin Gave , " Wonderful One , " and when he looked up and saw me standing there , he grinned and spread his arms wide and bowed low like he was greeting the queen . He was teasing , but something in the way he did it made me know he 'd been thinking about me these last three days , too . Then he walked up to me and stuck out his hand like the guys used to do at the dances where we 'd be on one side of the room and they 'd be on the other until some brave soul took that long walk and extended himself to one of us with enough courage to say yes . I took his hand and listened to Marvin seducing every woman within the sound of his voice , no matter how long he 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm living for .. . Eddie put his arm around me and started that slow , easy rock that begins a bop . I had grown up dancing with my big sister , Joyce , and brother-in-law , Mitch , so even though my generation was not known for its bopping abilities , I was good at it . I could see that Eddie was surprised at how easily I followed him . When he tried a fancy turn that doubled back on itself before ending in a slide , a minidip and that easy rock again , and I executed flawlessly , he grinned at me like I 'd been keeping a secret worth telling . " You 're too young to be bopping like that , " he said . " Mitch and Joyce used to dance all over the kitchen every time a Motown record came on the radio , " I said . " I learned in self-defense . " The next song on the album was " Forever , " a slow-down classic guaranteed to get you in trouble if you ended up dancing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other for a minute , but it was too soon for that kind of risk . Eddie lifted the tone arm and indicated his collection . " What 's your preference ? " " How about some more of those birds and bells you were playing last time ? " " You 're not just trying to be nice , are you ? " " I 'm not that nice , " I said . He put on the music and poured some hot water into a beautiful Chinese teapot , which he then deposited snugly into a basket with a brightly colored upholstered interior that had a hole cut in the center for that purpose . When he closed the top and carried it over to the low table in front of where I sat , it looked like an ordinary basket . But when he opened it , the delicate , flowery smell of the chamomile tea he had brewed rose up in a cloud of fragrant steam that mixed perfectly with the incense . I had seen pictures of tea cozies , but I 'd never known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sat down beside me . " You know why they do n't put handles on the cups ? " he said . I shook my head . I had always wondered . " If it 's too hot to pick up , it 's too hot to drink . " That made a lot of sense to me . I guess when your culture 's been around for 5,000 years or so , you have time CONT , IN , DON P.AGE 1421 to figure out stuff like that . I took a small sip of my tea and looked at Eddie . He smiled . " I appreciate your telling me all that the other night , " I said . His smile faded quickly , and I could see him waiting for my reaction . " I did n't really know how to react to it , " I said . " I probably still do n't , but I think I understand . " He nodded and took a sip of tea . " Now it 's my turn , " I said . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did n't seem capable of rushing or trying to make me rush . " I want to tell you something . " I sounded serious as hell and a flicker of something crossed Eddie 's face . He put his cup down slowly and let the smile go its own way . " All right . " I tried to remember my speech . All the stuff I was going to say to prepare him , to explain , to make sure he 'd understand , but nothing came to me , so I sat there , looking at him looking at me . He had done his time , paid his debt to society . It was my tab that was still running . " I 'm HIV-positive , " I said . " I 've known it for a year and I feel fine . " His face had n't registered any emotion at all , and I was trying so hard to read his mind , I thought I was going to have a stroke . " I just wanted to tell you because ... " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , so I just stopped again . Eddie was looking right at me , and even though his expression did n't change , something in his eyes did . Then he reached over , picked up my hand , turned it over and kissed my palm . His mouth felt warm and soft against my skin . His hair was brushing my wrist , and I could hear my heart beating steadily in the room like The Wailers " original rhythm section when they 'd been smoking serious ganja and Bob was in a good mood . It seemed as if all the nerve endings in my body had gathered together right there where his mouth was pressing against my hand . His voice was very gentle . " Is that it ? " " Yes . " When he looked up at me , I felt as if I could see every mistake I 'd ever made in his eyes , but no judgment , no anger , no shame , no questions except one : " Do you want to be with me ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom , right ? " He made it sound like the simplest thing in the world . I was so relieved , I wanted to fall into his arms and ask him if he would please kiss my palm like that for about three days , but we had to finish talking business first . I took a deep breath and tried to remain calm . I told him yes , we always had to use a condom , and there was some other stuff , too . The speech they give you at those Living With HIV workshops came back strong , and I started reciting the rules like it was the first day of safe-sex summer camp . " We ca n't exchange any body fluids . All noninvasive touching is okay . " He was still holding my hand , but now he was moving his finger lightly around in the small circle where his mouth had been . " What does that mean ? " he said . " It means you ca n't put your fingers inside me . " " Except for your mouth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the outline of my lips . " What makes you think I want your fingers in my mouth ? " " Do you ? " Maybe , " I said , then : " Yes . " But I had n't finished the rules , so I started up again with the do 's and don't 's until he interrupted me . " How about instead of telling me what I ca n't do , you tell me what I can do , and I 'll concentrate on that . " I hesitated . That sounded wonderful , but I did n't want to fool myself . I wanted to have it all on the table . There 's nothing like pulling out some unexpected latex to ruin a romantic moment . " I wo n't go anywhere you do n't invite me , " he said and ran his fingertip over my eyebrows . I closed my eyes . " Can I touch your face ? " he said . " Yes . " " Can I touch your eyes ? " " Yes . " " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I touch your shoulders ? " " Yes . " It was dark now , and there were flickering shadows on the walls around us . He kissed my forehead , my cheeks , my chin . " Can we take our clothes off ? " " Yes . " We slid out of our clothes , and his body in the candlelight was as beautiful as it had been under the moon . " Can I touch your breasts ? " " Yes . " " Your belly ? Your beautiful soft behind ? Your lovely legs ? " " Yes . " And he stroked and soothed and tickled and teased and looked and lingered and sighed and savored like he 'd been waiting for this moment as long as I had . And when he saw that he was bringing me to the edge of someplace I truly wanted to be , he leaned over and asked me in the sweetest possible way if he could go with me , so I took him in my hands . By now , we were whispering the questions together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I touch your heart your soul your spirit ? " And we sang the answers like a duet that we had practiced for a lifetime . " Oh , yes/ Oh , yes/ Oh , baby , yes , yes , yes ! " The Promise Eddie wanted me to spend the night , but I was n't ready for that yet . If it was a dream , I wanted to wake up in my own bed when it was over . After we got dressed , and I was ready to start back , he held me and kissed me for a long time , and I had enough sense to let him . It felt so right to be there that , of course , I started second-guessing myself immediately . What the hell was I thinking about ? This man had spent a lot of time and a lot of mental and physical energy trying to find a place where he could tap into some peace and quiet , and here I come with a load of problems nobody wants to deal with if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What , baby ? " I leaned back to look into his face and the memory of how good his body felt close to mine made me want to just shut up , and if this was a fairy tale , just keep believing , at least for another minute or two . But I could n't . I took a deep breath . " You 're not pretending , are you ? " " Pretending what ? " " That this is the beginning of something . " " Is n't it ? " " You know what I mean . " " No , I do n't , " he said . " I really do n't . " I took another breath . " Pretending , " I said , hating the whiny tone in my voice . " That now we 'll get together and get married and have some kids and all the rest of it . " He always took his own time answering questions , but this time it seemed like we stood there looking at each other for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of that , " he said . " I had a wife who was willing to help some people kill me so she could get high . I had two kids who would n't recognize me if they walked in here right now , because they were born when I was too young to raise them and too crazy to love them right . I 'm not planning anything and I 'm not pretending anything and I 'm not expecting you to do anything except love me as hard and as strong as I 'm going to love you . " He kissed me then for what felt like another hour and when we finally came up for air , he was grinning . " Fair enough ? " I just nodded and leaned into his arms again . It was n't like I had to rush right home or anything ...
