<p> Bright-eyed , blond-haired Natalia clutched an empty gum wrapper tightly in her small hand . She had chewed and , undoubtedly , swallowed the gum hours before , but , unaccustomed to gifts of any kind , she still treasured the wrapper . <p> Natalia , 6 , was waiting for a medical examination , one step on a journey from a Russian orphanage to a new life in the United States . She is one of a group of 11 children slated for U.S. adoption , most of whom are to leave Russia today to meet new parents who so far have seen only their photographs . <p> The children , all considered by authorities here to be handicapped in some way , are among a growing number of Russians without families who are being matched with families in America eager to adopt . The movement is gathering strength as the collapsing Russian economy raises fears that many more children will soon find themselves abandoned . <p> The trend has elicited a complex mixture of hope , shame and anxiety among officials here . <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so will be consigned , despite average or above-average intelligence , to lives of drudgery and mistreatment in adult residential institutions here , according to foreign and Russian experts . The labels are enough to keep Russian families from adopting them , and many care givers here rejoice if they can find homes in any country . <p> " These children do n't understand the difference between America and the Soviet Union and Germany , " said Isolde Peterson , director of Children 's Home No. 5 in northern Moscow . " They just understand wanting to be wanted . " <p> But many Russians , as well as U.S. diplomats and adoption executives , say they fear that this nation 's impoverishment and its current legal confusion will encourage a mercenary trade in babies . <p> " One message we want to convey is that this is not the last frontier for healthy white infants , " said Karen V. Stager , director of International Families , which arranged Natalia 's adoption . " The embassy is very concerned that people will be flooding in making special deals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners into their problems and express shame at their inability to care for their own . " This is no occasion for celebration , " said Marina Gavriyanova , director of Orphanage No. 12 , as she prepared documents for one of her young charges to emigrate . " It 's a shame that we have to export our children because we can not support them . " <p> Beneath such feelings lie even deeper fears that many Russians harbor for an entire generation . Ever since the Bolshevik Revolution 75 years ago , Soviet parents have eased their hardships by accepting the propaganda that they were building communism , or at least a better life , for their offspring . <p> Now that better life is supposed to come with democracy and capitalism . Many Russians , convinced that their Soviet education renders them unfit for this new world , again are comforting themselves through hard times with the hope that the next generation will prosper . <p> But the very difficulties of the transition , the economic privations and malnutrition caused by the collapse of the old system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering most , " said Ella Pamphilova , minister of social protection in President Boris Yeltsin 's cabinet . " They do n't have enough food for normal , healthy development . Everything in society that is bad affects children first . " <p> Nowhere is that clearer than in Russia 's vast network of sometimes cheerful , often bleak baby homes , children 's homes and boarding schools for older orphans and handicapped children . There are about 310,000 children in such institutions , and only 2 percent of them are genuine orphans without living parents , according to Ludmila Fimina , chief psychologist in the Russian Education Ministry 's department of rehabilitation . <p> The rest are what Fimina called " social orphans , " whose parents are jailed or sick ; or have been deprived of their rights because of abusive behavior ; or simply can not afford to care for their babies . It is this last category that officials fear will soar along with food prices . <p> " Unemployment is coming , the psychological stress is very great , the destructive process is striking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers bringing their kids to us and saying they simply can not take care of them . " <p> According to Fimina , Stager and others who have visited many orphanages , the children can expect to be decently fed and clothed in most such institutions , but understaffing and overcrowding often leave little time for personal attention and affection . In baby centers , where children live until age 3 , infants mostly lie on their backs without stimulation and are attended to only for feeding and changing . <p> In orphanages for older children , dozens of small cots are lined up with identical quilts and no teddy bears , no pictures on the wall , no signs of individual expression . <p> For those physically handicapped or labeled retarded , the future is especially bleak . An investigation by Caroline Cox , a member of the British Parliament , and a team of experts found that one-third to two-thirds of such children scored average or above on intelligence tests , but fewer than 1 in 1,000 will be reevaluated by the Russian system . <p> Instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent to homes for the handicapped and then forced to provide cheap labor in factories . Those who rebel often end up on the streets , in jail or in psychiatric hospitals being given behavior-altering drugs for " social control , " the team said in a 1991 report titled " Trajectories of Despair : Misdiagnosis and Maltreatment of Soviet Orphans . " <p> Fimina described the case of 7-year-old Oleg who has a deformed hand and will soon be sent to a home for the handicapped . He would likely stay in institutions all his life unless he finds a home abroad , despite having high intelligence and an engaging personality . The director of the home , alarmed at the boy 's prospects , recently sent an emergency appeal to Stager 's organization , which said it believes it has found a family for him in the United States . <p> Peterson 's Home No. 5 , benefiting from a caring staff and considerable " humanitarian aid " from Germany , is a reasonably cheerful haven in a bleak industrial district of Moscow . Toys , stuffed animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here , stigmatized at school and shunned by the system , often " lose themselves " once they leave , Peterson said . <p> The upheavals , wars and political purges of Soviet life have created a tradition of orphanages , and Soviet propaganda long maintained that the state could nurture as well as , or better than , parents . Now the system is being reformed to encourage that children remain in one orphanage as long as possible , instead of moving at age 7 and perhaps again at 11 , and to help families keep their children at home . But with Russia 's economy in disarray , officials say improvement will come slowly . <p> In the meantime , interest from abroad is growing fast . An American diplomat said the first known U.S. adoption of a Soviet baby came in the fall of 1990 . Last year , 35 adoptions were approved ; in just the first month of this year , 16 ; and more than 100 applications are now on file from Americans hoping to adopt here . <p> Adoption-related scandals in Romania after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's involved , " the diplomat added . " Our goal is to make sure nothing like Romania happens here by close adherence to the law . " <p> American parents who want to adopt here must first get approval from their own state agencies and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , then from Russian authorities and finally from the U.S. Embassy , which must grant visas to the children . The embassy 's goal is to ensure that the child qualifies for adoption under both U.S. and Russian laws and that no parent here retains any legal claim , the diplomat said . <p> Russian policy is to let only those children go who could not find homes here , " so we do n't take children out of the arms of prospective Russian parents , " Fimina said . She and other Russian officials said Russians will not adopt children whom some Americans will welcome  --  not only those with real or alleged mental and physical disabilities , but also those whose parents have a history of mental disease or alcoholism or those whose parents are not both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her U.S.-mandated exam , the social worker from her orphanage spoke of Russian parents ' preferences . <p> " They will never take such kids , " said Galina Denisenko , speaking openly in front of the three children . " They want perfect health and babies only . . . . In four years , we have not placed a single child . " <p> Russian reluctance hinges in part on the difficulty of daily life here and the absence of medical and social support . Many parents could find an artificial limb , for example , only on the black market at prices few can afford . <p> Fimina said it also reflects a difference in motive . " Our families adopt for themselves , to feel fulfilled within themselves , and so they want their children to be the smartest , most beautiful of all , " she said . " American families often are thinking of the child . They do n't have this feeling of wanting theirs to be the best but instead want him to be the best he can , to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears some Americans may seek to circumvent the rules and pay to adopt healthy children here . <p> " We would n't want Americans to bring this problem to us , " she said . " Those who are willing to pay big money , let them go to some other country . " <p> Peterson said such a scandal would confirm the worst fears of many bureaucrats , who already say , " We 're criminals , moral criminals , giving our children away . " But to the children themselves , she said , standards of living are irrelevant ; all that matters is " being needed by someone . " <p> " They all say , ' Please take me . ' They write in their books , ' Please take me , ' " she said . " They look at me with such eyes and say , ' When will it be my turn ? ' Sometimes I ca n't walk into their rooms . "
