Q. When you were asked whether the money you contributed to the so-called Keating Five  --  Senators Alan Cranston , Dennis DeConcini , Donald Reigle , John Glenn and John McCain  --  influenced them to help you , you said , " I certainly hope so . " <P> A. That probably was a dumb way to phrase it . I was participating in a system . I have never asked to give anybody money . A politician will come to me and say , " Will you make a contribution ? " And they usually suggest a size for you to go out and try and collect . Now I did n't make all those contributions ; I went out and collected them . I only contributed to the legal limit . <P> Q. Surely there 's something in it for you . Senator Cranston was able to collect $850,000 over four years from you . Do n't you get a little tired of being hit up ? <P> A. You get tired of getting hit up again and again and again . But it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , an individual who asks for help with citizenship papers for his mother , and he gets help . But the campaign chairman for the politician does n't go ask him for money . The chairman goes where he sees there is a source of funds . So when I ask for something , I become a prospect for money . <P> Q. So then what did the Senators do for you ? <P> A. All the Senators said was either hit Keating or finish the investigation , this had to be the longest examination in the history of the S &L; business . If you ca n't go to the Congress to get relief from an agency that 's gone haywire , what do you do ? You live in a different country than I think we live in . <P> Q. You say you 're broke , but how could you be when you and your family made at least $14 million in three years ? <P> A. The Government knows , because they know all of our bank accounts , that my family and I probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in 1983 , before I bought Lincoln Savings and Loan , we had a fair market value as a family of many tens of millions of dollars . We produced , we were making money , we had excellent assets . We took a failing S &L,; we made $17 million in the partial year we first took it , pretax . We made $100 million the next year . Then the Feds started helping us run it , so we only made $80 some million in the third year . Their help intensified in ' 87 , and we made about $60-plus million . In ' 88 they really came in and took us over , and in ' 89 they completed the confiscation . <P> Q. You act as if the Federal Government is just out to ruin your life . Not just your life but your depositors ' , and bondholders in American Continental Corp . who mistakenly assumed their investments were federally insured . <P> A. There 's a lot of people who know that the Government goes haywire in a lot of respects . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one to know because you 're looking at the HUD situation , you look at the IRS problems . Almost everything you scratch , there 's a problem . <P> Q. You can look at the HUD scandal and see whose pocket the money is in . But you ca n't see any money in the pocket of Edwin Gray , the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman , who fingered you . What 's the motive ?
