##@x <p> The Underworld Bank scandal is oozing out all over . <p> Conceived in Karachi , financed in Abu Dhabi , the conspiracy reached into the world 's Western capitals and perhaps the U.N . under the protection of high-paid lobbyists and naive spooks . The B.C.C.I. scandal involves the laundering of drug money , the illicit financing of terrorism and of arms to Iraq , the easy purchase of respectability and the corruption of the world banking system . <p> For more than a decade , the biggest banking swindle in history worked beautifully . Between $5 billion and $15 billion was bilked from governments and individual depositors to be put to the most evil of purposes  --  while lawmen and regulators slept . <p> Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open . Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau , who gave impetus to long-contained probes , told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department . <p> Justice 's Criminal Division chief , Robert Mueller , tells me he will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury . <p> And what about the revelation last week by the New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth that the C.I.A . was using B.C.C.I. for payoffs abroad , which may have been used by the swindlers as a cover ? " At no time have we received a request from the intelligence community , " insists Mr. Mueller , " to alter or suspend or in any way change the course of our investigation . " <p> He may not know everything that is going on around him ; one of the threats to Robert Gates 's nomination to head the C.I.A . is the question of what use he made of B.C.C.I. in the 80 's ; the agency is now preparing a report for Senate Intelligence . <p> When asked in 1981 by the Federal Reserve Board for the background of a key investor in B.C.C.I. , the C.I.A . neglected to note that he was the chief of Saudi intelligence  --  later code-named " Tumbleweed "  --  a relevant fact of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dereliction , the top Fed enforcement officer , William Taylor , chirped : " Some people like that become President . " <p> Interlocking banking directorates cry out for examination , as between B.C.C.I. and B.A.I.I. , the Luxembourg-shrouded Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement . ( Maybe we should close our embassy in Luxembourg . ) <p> I suspect a connection , too , between the B.C.C.I. conspiracy and Atlanta 's Bank Lavoro scandal , in which $3 billion in hot cash was run past our befuddled Fed . Of that , $600 million in " grain guarantees " was in effect snatched from the U.S. taxpayer and most likely used to finance nuclear arms and rockets for Saddam Hussein . Justice 's Mueller and his overwhelmed Fraud Section chief , Larry Ergenson , think my suspicion is misplaced ; we 'll see . <p> A question investigators have been too timid to ask : Why did dirty-money sources give $8 million to Jimmy Carter 's clean-air philanthropy ? The former President , transported royally on B.C.C.I. aircraft , arranged for his friends to hire a former British Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third world to lend respectability to these con men ? Why did n't his C.I.A . briefers warn him ? <p> Congressional oversight , excluding Senator Kerry , has been myopic . Joe Biden , chairman of Senate Judiciary , pleads preoccupation with crime bills and confirmations , but says : " Justice is beginning to awaken to the scope of this . If Justice does n't move , we 'll move on Justice . " <p> Where are the media ? Regardie 's magazine took the lead with the news that a mysterious group controlled the Washington bank headed by Clark Clifford . Time magazine devotes a cover to the scandal this week , following its excellent April 1 reporting , and The Wall Street Journal 's coverage is must reading for scandalmongers . The networks have found the biggest heist in history all too complicated and un-visual ; months from now , " 60 Minutes " may come on the field to shoot the wounded . <p> But this is more than a good story . As we flip over this huge flat rock of corruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms , drugs and fraud . <p> /* //* //* //* //* //* //* @@649965 2110 A.D. Maximum security does n't even begin to describe it . <br> No one talks to the prisoner . No one enters his cell . No one sets foot in his cell-block . No one else is confined within . The guards charged with carrying out these directives stand outside the cell-block doors in powered armor . The presidential seal has been placed upon those doors . Only one man can break that seal . And he 's not taking calls . <br> The cell-block is located at the far end of one wing of a massive space station that 's the aggregation of several smaller ones , each one capable of operating autonomously should the need arise . But none of the crew have ever witnessed such a moment . Nor do they expect to . Nor , if truth be told , do they think of themselves as a crew . They consider themselves a garrison . And the space station they man is one of the largest fortresses ever built . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that 's been an American possession for almost a century now . Its defenses are organized into several orbiting perimeters . Clouds of mini-sats and space mines begin a hundred klicks out . They comprise the first perimeter , stretching as close to the center as sixty klicks in places , forming a continuously shifting pattern that only those kept current with the correct routes can navigate through . <br> Fifty klicks out , the directed-energy batteries begin to appear : a variety of sats equipped with lasers , particle beams , and microwaves capable of lacerating targets at the speed of light , arranged in several layers , intended to both maximize crossfire capability and ensure maximum redundancy of hardware . Most of those weapons are optimized to hit targets in vacuum , but some of the larger ones are intended for planetary bombardment . <br> Twenty klicks out the manned defenses begin . Some are troopships designed for rapid deployment to the lunar or terrestrial theaters . Some house still more guns . Some contain the razors who defend the U.S. zone against net in-cursions . Many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots and give the real weapons a chance to do some damage . <br> Ten klicks out are the giant slabs of rock  --  chunks of asteroids that have been towed into position to orbit L5 like fragments of some incomplete sphere . Five klicks out is the second , inner layer of slabs . Each rock has more weapons racked upon it , including more directed-energy cannons , along with rows of mass-drivers that can take advantage of a ready supply of ammunition . <br> At the center of all this sits the L5 fortress half a kilometer across . It 's manned by razors , logistics-masters , and AIs intended to direct L5 's defenses in the event of war with the Eurasian Coalition , ready to make adjustments as enemy fire degrades the libration point 's assets and enemy targets are reprioritized . Scenarios are constantly played out , assessed , and reassessed . The men and women of L5 train daily for the day of final reckoning . <br> But national security takes many forms . Not all of it involves planning for the next war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on right now . <br> The prisoner is in his sixties . He wears the regulation uniform that everyone in American military custody wears . His cell contains no furniture , just toilet facilities and a small hatch through which food and water comes . <br> The man drinks the water , but he barely touches the food . He does n't seem to sleep either . He just sits cross-legged on the floor , staring at the locked door opposite him . <br> But then he notices a screen on the wall where there 's no screen he knew of . <br> Even as he hears a voice he thought he 'd never hear again . <br> Hacking L5 is impossible . Not just for all the usual reasons  --  interlocking firewalls , elite razors , guardian AIs , uncrackable codes , systems switching on and off randomly so that even were hostile razors to get inside they 'd still be kicked back out into the cold  --  but because of L5 's location , almost four hundred thousand kilometers away from both Earth and Moon . Any razor based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage , working a fraction of a second behind the razors based at L5 due to the limits of light 's speed . A razor could operate out of a spaceship closer in  --  but for that very reason L5 accepts no signal traffic that has n't traveled a certain distance . <br> All of which makes a hack on L5 almost impossible . Unless the attacking razor is based at L5 itself . <br> Or unless that razor 's something more than razor . <br> The face now appearing on the screen opposite the prisoner is that of a woman . She looks like she 's about thirty . She 's got brown hair and freckles . She looks like she 's neither slept nor smiled in a long time . <br> " Matthew Sinclair , " she says . <br> The man smiles . " Nothing 's beyond you now , " he says . <br> " You knew all along . " <br> " I 'd put it no higher than hoped . " <br> " Which does n't mean you did n't plan it . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it . " His voice is lit with a strange sort of pride . " I assume that the ones who watch this room are seeing the same footage they 've been too bored to watch for days now ? " <br> " It 's like I 'm not even here , " she says . " I 'm a long way out too . " <br> " Oh ? Where are you , Claire ? " <br> She smiles : right . " Right here , Matthew . " <br> " No one 's called me that since my wife died . " <br> " I did n't know you were married . " <br> " She killed herself . " <br> " I 'm sorry . " <br> " Why have you come here ? " he asks . <br> " To see you . " <br> " To learn , you mean . But I fear you 've chosen a man sadly out of every loop . You have the advantage of at least knowing that I really am Matthew Sinclair . I do n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes slightly . The man watches . <br> " Ah . Codes I gave you . And footage from within the plane Morat jacked . Taken by your ocular cameras , I presume  --  is he dead , by the way ? " <br> " Yes , " she says . " He 's dead . " <br> " Did he die well ? " <br> " Not particularly . " <br> " Did you kill him ? " <br> " Yes . " <br> " With news like that , you 're welcome here anytime . With or without those codes establishing that you 're probably Claire . But even if you 're not her , you 're still welcome to anything I have to say . I 've told the Throne everything anyway . I 'm finished , as you can see . My life is over . " <br> " Then why are you still alive ? " <br> " Because Andrew has yet to use that laser  --  the one through which you 're projecting your face  --  as a blowtorch against my head . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's too bad . " <br> " You call the Throne by his first name . " <br> " And I daresay I earned the privilege . I 've known him for fifty years . Long before he became president . We used to be midshipmen , you know . Back in the final days of the old navy . Back before we laid the foundations of what was to become NavCom . I remember when  --  " <br> " Do I look like I came here to listen to an old man reminiscing ? " <br> " You 'd deny me my memories ? " <br> " You denied mine . " <br> " Only so you could become what you are . " <br> " And I 'll never forgive you for it . " <br> " I do n't ask for your forgiveness , Claire . All I require is what 's beyond your power to preclude : my own recollections . The foundations of NavCom  --  I remember so well the blueprints of those ships , the likes of which the world had never seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercavitation at hundreds of klicks an hour . I tell you , Claire , when I was the nation 's chief spymaster , I often yearned for those simpler times . " <br> " Why did the Throne make you head of CICom ? " <br> " Because he and I could practically complete each other 's sentences . And because he wanted at least one source of unwavering support in the Inner Cabinet . He knew I 'd never betray him . " <br> " But you did betray him . " <br> " I was the only one who was true to him . " <br> " Is that how you rationalize it ? " <br> " He used to have such dreams , Claire . He alone understood what was required . Ironic , is n't it ? The military is acknowledged at long last as the only force that can save the country  --  and promptly finds itself undone by its own straitjacketed imagination . Only one man was capable of rising above that . Andrew Harrison opened my eyes . He showed me that the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem was how to transcend that problem . How to channel human energy into goals worthy of humanity . How to solve Earth 's energy and environmental crisis once and for all . Thus the repurposing of our military machines . DTtente was a mere stepping stone along the way . Andrew 's ultimate agenda was to lay the groundwork for a new civilization . " <br> " That sounds a lot like what the Rain claimed to want . " <br> " That 's no coincidence . It 's the inevitable goal of any mind able to break free of the cage that passes for conventional thinking . The real question lies in the new world 's contours . And the Rain is precisely where Andrew went wrong . " <br> " But he created them . " <br> " No , Claire . I created them . He merely signed off on them . " <br> " And the order for their termination . " <br> " Indeed . He 'd become convinced that the elite commando unit we 'd built to hit the East 's leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <br> " And was he wrong in thinking that ? " <br> " You know , you really are Claire . " <br> " What makes you say that ? " <br> " Because this conversation is proceeding exactly as you would conduct it . The oblique probing about the past . The gradual revealing to me of what 's going on outside this room . The gradual closing in upon the question you 're really dying to ask . " <br> " After the Throne had the Praetorians eliminate Autumn Rain , did you maintain a link to the surviving members who later downed the Elevator ? " <br> Sinclair 's mouth creases upward in something that 's well short of smile . <br> " Yes , " he says . " I did . " <br> " You 'll just come right out and admit it . " <br> " As I 've told you , I have nothing to hide . Not anymore . " <br> " So tell me why you  --  " <br> " It 's strange , Claire . We thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was his right-hand man , and we were only in our forties . We would either defeat the East or reach accommodation with them , and then move on to greater things . But when he ordered Autumn Rain 's destruction I came up against the limitations of his vision . I saw that I had surpassed him , that he would never green-light humanity 's successors . I realized that the sooner I ruled in his place , the quicker I would be able to finish the task he started . " <br> " But you 'd already turned on him , Matthew .
