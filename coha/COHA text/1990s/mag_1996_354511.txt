THE MAN WHO WOULD BRING DOWN the Tobacco Kings spent last Friday teaching high school in Louisville , Kentucky . While lawyers for his former employer , tobacco giant Brown &; Williamson , lobbed allegations of his untrustworthiness at the press , while 60 Minutes staff members put the finishing touches on an interview with him that they planned to air on Sunday , Jeffrey S. Wigand kept mum on the one subject about which he apparently has much to say . <P> But the words Wigand has already spoken  --  to Mike Wallace and to a panel of Mississippi lawyers who in late November heard his deposition in a suit against the tobacco industry  --  can not be unsaid . As the highest-ranking tobacco insider ever to turn whistle-blower , Wigand 's incendiary allegations about what tobacco executives knew and how they hid it go to the heart of some half-dozen investigations and lawsuits around the country . And if a man 's true danger can be judged by how heavily his enemies are armed , then Wigand , once a vice president for research and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . B &W; is going to great lengths to discredit him , while lawmakers are paying close attention to his testimony . As Mike Moore , attorney general in Mississippi , which ( like Minnesota , Florida , Massachusetts and West Virginia ) is suing tobacco companies to recoup millions of dollars spent treating smoking-related illnesses , puts it , " He knows where all the bodies are buried . " <P> Wigand 's formerly low profile was blown sky-high in November , during a controversy over CBS ' 60 Minutes ' cutting back a segment on cigarettes because of fear of legal retaliation . Wigand was revealed to be CBS ' Deep Throat , and B &W; immediately slapped him with a lawsuit charging theft , fraud and breach of contract , stemming from a confidentiality agreement he had signed when he left B &W; in 1993 . Wigand nevertheless gave his Mississippi deposition . After somebody leaked a copy of his testimony to the Wall Street Journal , which published key excerpts and lofted the entire document onto the World Wide Web , 60 Minutes decided to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations , while not totally surprising , have a shattering specificity . For example , he recalls many instances in which former B &W; chief Thomas Sandefur acknowledged nicotine 's addictive power . Federal prosecutors are weighing possible perjury charges against a number of executives , including Sandefur , who declared under oath during 1994 congressional hearings that nicotine is not addictive . They would be interested in exchanges such as this one from Wigand 's Mississippi deposition : " Q : Did Mr. Sandefur have a position that if science affected sales , the science would take the back door ? " Wigand responded , " Yes . " <P> Wigand also remembers vivid scenes of his employers ' covering their tracks in anticipation of the very lawsuits they are now battling . He alleges , for instance , that , with Sandefur 's approval , a company lawyer deleted 12 pages from the minutes of a meeting attended by Wigand and other top scientists from B &W's; affiliates in which there was discussion of developing a " safer cigarette .
