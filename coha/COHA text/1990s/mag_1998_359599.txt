COMRADES IN TROUBLE <P> " When we had not yet recovered from the Tequila Effect and the Saki Effect , we became the victims of the Vodka Effect . " RAUL H. ALVAREZ Buenos Aires , Argentina <P> Russians should fasten their seat belts and get ready for the worst RUSSIA IN CRISIS , Sept. 7 . The country , like most developing countries , failed to get off on the right foot . Any sudden change brings difficulties . It is easy to embrace something new , especially when it looks as attractive as capitalism does . Western society , particularly the U.S. 's , fueled this metamorphosis , forgetting that changing a system is one thing and changing the mentality of a people who have lived in the system for ages is almost an impossibility . Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin reassured Russia  --  and probably the West  --  that there would be " no return to the past . " Sadly , there can be no return , and , worse still , the future is not just uncertain ; it is also certainly scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. make a generous offer to buy Russia 's nuclear arsenal ? If accepted , the U.S. would gain an additional measure of national security , and Russia would get an infusion of needed cash . If refused , the U.S. would benefit in world opinion from being seen as taking a stronger moral position if it declined to give further financial aid to Russia . ROBERT S. HANFORD Rochester , N.Y . <P> The only reporters asking questions about Monica Lewinsky at the summit news conference were American . With everything that is going on in Russia , those reporters  --  not the President  --  looked like idiots . And because American reporters asked the President the Monica question , they could go home and report how his personal problems are hurting him abroad . It is the American media that should be put on trial . LARRY T. MALINOWSKI Warren , Mich . <P> At the Moscow news conference , the questions reporters addressed to President Clinton about the Lewinsky matter were significant because they demonstrated the degree of freedom of speech and the press that Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inspired to include among their proposals for reforms freedom of speech and the press . They are the only way to build and guarantee freedom . The U.S. should provide food , clothing and medical supplies to the poor and needy in Russia while the country is getting back on its feet . Monetary aid to foreign countries too often winds up in the coffers of the oppressors , the heartless and the greedy in government . If liberty is to flourish and the people are to prosper , those of goodwill in a society must have a chance to survive and elevate themselves . RON ZEH Binghamton , N.Y . <P> How ironic that it took the collapse of Russia 's corrupt style of laissez-faire capitalism to bring about the ultimate results of Marxism . Russia has finally achieved a classless and cashless society . A marginal economic existence for the masses has created one homogenized class of poor people , and the worthlessness of the ruble has virtually eliminated it as Russia 's medium of exchange . Karl Marx 's utopian vision has now been realized , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmarish world of anarchy . JONATHAN SPIVAK North York , Ont . <P> In the cover picture , both of Clinton 's hands are visible , but Yeltsin 's left hand is not . Where is it ? I 'll bet it 's in Clinton 's pocket  --  again .
