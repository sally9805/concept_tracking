<p> THEY met accidentally at a restaurant in Hawaii , and really all they had on their minds was lunch . <p> But they struck up a conversation . They shared a few laughs . <p> And before they knew it , they were dating . <p> Brian was a hairdresser , exuberant and loud . <p> Josh was a military man , in love with his job . <p> As the relationship developed , he also was in love with Brian . <p> " " I got me a soldier boy , " Brian said wryly . <p> Josh served his country in Vietnam , Korea and Iran . Over the years he earned two bronze stars and an Army commendation medal . <p> His performance evaluations by his Army supervisors were consistently stellar . <p> " " Pound for pound the most smoothly efficient administrative noncommissioned officer I 've ever served with , " one admiring boss wrote , then gave Josh the highest possible numerical rating . <p> By the mid-1980s , Josh was working in Washington , D.C. , for the Department of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't think of joining the Army - the uniforms are n't my color , " Brian says . " " But Josh was so proud of his work . Every morning he would put on a freshly laundered uniform and go off to do a good job . " <p> The issue of gays and lesbians in the military has evoked the fury of Americans , pro and con , for the past six months . <p> President Clinton has said yes , they should be allowed to serve . <p> Under existing regulations , however , homosexuality is grounds for immediate discharge . The rationale for that policy has changed periodically , but a popular explanation today is that gay and lesbian soldiers would n't be safe from their peers . <p> For years , Brian says , supervisors who knew or guessed that Josh was gay simply kept the information to themselves . They did n't want to lose a good soldier and a good friend , Brian says . Then , on Feb. 12 , 1986 , a phone call to their Washington apartment was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Josh built . <p> Who was Josh 's family ? <p> Brian is Brian Bradley , a 32-year-old gay rights and AIDS activist living in Houston . <p> " " Thirty-two sounds so young , and I feel so old , " he says . <p> " " Josh " is a nickname for Brian 's Army sergeant lover . The Chronicle is withholding Josh 's real name at the request of his 64-year-old mother . <p> Brian says the United States Army and its homophobic policies against gays in the military demoralized Josh and hastened his death from AIDS . <p> Josh 's mother , a religious woman who belongs to the Church of Christ , suggests that Josh died of leukemia and does not allow her son 's sexual orientation to be mentioned in her home . <p> Once Josh tried to broach the subject of homosexuality with his mom , whom he loved . He said to her , " " How would you feel if someone you knew were gay ? " <p> She ended the conversation almost before it began . " " The Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about them . It 's ugly . " <p> Josh died in Houston and was cremated here . Then Brian took the ashes to Josh 's mother on the East Coast . Together they laid him to rest with a military funeral . <p> Brian loved Josh when he was well , nursed him when he was sick , embraced Josh as he took his last breath , then assumed all responsibility for the details of Josh 's death . <p> You might wonder , Brian says , not bitter but hurt , who is Josh 's real family . <p> Backgrounds differ <p> Brian has rarely , if ever , had a thought he would n't share . <p> " " I 've always been openly gay , " he says . " " My mother did n't raise me with religious dogma or sexual dogma , either . " Brian 's mom was and is an unusual person . She tries to do what is right , and she does n't care if anybody approves or not . <p> " " We were very poor , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian says . " " My mother had the only house in Hickory Flat , Miss. , where African-Americans came as guests , not servants . " <p> After graduating from high school , Brian studied acting in New York , then hopped around the country . He supported himself as a waiter , model , hairdresser , and , after going back to school with Josh 's support , as a surgical technologist . <p> " " I never wanted to be one thing , " he says . " " The most compelling drive of my life has been to see things , learn things and explore . " Josh 's early experiences were far more traditional . <p> His mom was a housewife . His dad was a car dealer . Josh , like the family he was brought up in , was quiet , reserved , conservative . <p> At his segregated high school , he dated girls . <p> " " Josh said he could look back and know he was gay , but he never understood it or accepted it , " Brian says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 - for 10 years he was unsure of his sexuality and fought it . " <p> Brian and Josh moved in together a few months after they started dating . Neither had ever tried a committed , " " till-death-do-you-part " relationship . They loved it . <p> " " We made a full , well-rounded home together , " Brian says . <p> " " I came from a broken home ; ours was n't broken . " <p> Early on Brian asked Josh to talk about his work . Brian loved tales of espionage and intrigue , and he knew that Josh had a cigarette light-er that doubled as a camera . <p> " " Just watch the news , " Josh would say , refusing to divulge government secrets . <p> In Hawaii , Josh worked in the department that granted or revoked security clearances , and men in that same department investigated military personnel accused of homosexuality . <p> Just once , when the Army planned to bust some lesbian soldiers who had formed a softball team , Josh intervened . <p> Most of the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had the right to burst into their apartments any time of the day or night . Some higher-ups planned a late-night raid to see who they could catch in bed with whom . <p> Josh called to warn the women and added , " " Do what you think you should . " <p> " " Was Josh going to stand by while the women 's careers were destroyed ? " Brian asks . " " People lose their children , they commit suicide , over things like that . " <p> The raid came off as planned . Instead of finding lesbians in bed with each other , however , the military police found lesbians in bed with gay men . <p> And do you know what ? Brian asks . " " The men in the intelligence branch of the U.S. Army thought it was plain old heterosexual sex . They could n't tell the difference . " <p> Virus detected <p> In the summer of 1985 Josh and Brian traded the white sand of Waikiki for cosmopolitan Washington . Brian started school in surgical technology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Hawaii , though , Josh had a routine physical . <p> He forgot about it , Brian forgot about it , until the phone rang that wintery evening in 1986 . <p> Brian could hear Josh saying " " yes sir , yes sir , yes sir , " but mostly Josh said nothing . All the color , all the light , left his face . <p> " " Who died ? " Brian wondered . <p> Josh was told to report to Walter Reed Army Medical Center the next morning at 8 a.m. and to bring enough clothes for a five-day stay . Josh had HIV , the precursor to AIDS . <p> " " Josh was 35 years old , and he was in the best physical and mental condition of his life , " Brian says . " " In the hospital , though , he was totally demoralized . " <p> He was segregated on a ward with other HIV and AIDS patients . They had to clean their own bathrooms and change their own beds . The nurses and doctors who treated them practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , on the fifth day , Josh received a temporary medical discharge , which meant he still was on the payroll but could n't work . <p> One week he was briefing and debriefing ambassadors , Brian says . " " The next week he was told not to worry about going back to the office to clean out his desk - his ( belongings were ) in a box waiting for him . The Army thought he was a threat , a contagion . <p> They thought he would endanger the lives of people around him . " <p> At that point Josh still loved his job . He wanted to keep working , and his supervisor , a colonel , tried to help him do that . <p> " " You ca n't get AIDS by being in the same room with someone , " the colonel argued at the Pentagon . " " He 's not going to war , he 's in a city , in an office , and he 's not a threat . This man is the finest soldier I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't stop nagging , he might lose his job , too . <p> " " It disgusted the hell out of me , " Brian says . " " At that point Josh had almost 20 years of military service . In Vietnam , he 'd killed two Viet Cong . When a country asks a young boy to put his life on the line and take another person 's life to protect democracy and he does it because he 's told it 's right and then he 's treated worse than the enemy he was told to kill . . . . " <p> As he tells Josh 's story , Brian moves around his small Montrose apartment nervously . He 's not eating well , he 's not sleeping well and he is panicked about his own health . Finally he opens a sliding glass door between the living room and tiny balcony and starts to smoke . <p> During the summer of ' 86 , Brian and Josh moved back to Hawaii ; in the fall of ' 87 , they moved to Houston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane for Houston , he told Brian he felt as if something bit him . <p> Actually he had shingles , his first opportunistic infection , and by the time he got off the plane , his face was so swollen he could n't see out of one eye . <p> For the next two years , Brian and Josh fought AIDS at home and at the doctor 's office . Josh was hospitalized only twice , briefly . <p> That second time Brian took stock of the situation and asked that Josh be discharged . He wanted his lover to have the peace and comfort of dying at home . <p> They celebrated their fifth anniversary on Oct. 9 , 1989 . <p> Josh was down to 107 pounds . <p> The next morning , the two talked for the last time . <p> " " He was alert , calm , very peaceful . I told him how I appreciated his friendship . He said how proud he was of me . I said , " I love you . ' Then he squeezed my hand and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was the most peaceful , graceful moment of my life , " Brian says . " " All the illness , sickness and death seemed to go right through the ceiling with him . It was as if very little had died . " Brian has HIV , also . <p> " " Josh got through it , I hope I have the grace to get through it , too , " Brian says . " " I just regret he wo n't be with me. "
