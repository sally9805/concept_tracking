<p> LOS ANGELES - Meet " " Daddy Dearest , " Don Rickles ' latest incarnation in a TV sitcom with something to offend everybody . <p> " " Don Rickles and Richard Lewis , where else but Fox ? Scheduled to follow " " Married . .. With Children , " came the network pitch to the Television Critics Association meeting here to preview the fall lineup . <p> Ah , yes . The perfect TV couplings to make Fox 's Sunday the sleaziest night of the week . When Fox tested " " Daddy Dearest " ( on testees too young to know Don Rickles ) , the audience thought he was funnier than Martin Lawrence of Martin , Fox 's biggest hit of last season . Shudder . <p> " " Daddy Dearest " premieres on Fox this fall , with Rickles as dear old Dad , and Lewis as his son . Theirs is the tackiest family to hit TV since the Bundys colored Fox blue . <p> Rickles ' Al is a retired used car salesman whose wife threw him out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lewis is Dr. Steven Mitchell , psychologist , whose wife has divorced him and left him with their young son , Danny . Both of these guys are beyond therapy , and the kid will be , too , if he stays in this household long . <p> As Fox explains it , Al and Steven are " " a father and son whose deep underlying love for one another is best expressed through insults and antagonism . " <p> As the show goes , though , it 's nothing more than Rickles ' old nightclub act and Lewis ' on-the-edge-of-breakdown stand-up routine in the role of straight man to a bigot . <p> Rickles ' nasty cracks obviously appeal to the crowds in Las Vegas and Atlantic City . Insults are his comedy trade , and they 've kept him a major player in those showrooms for more than 35 years . <p> But what goes in the clubs goes down the drain on TV , and Rickles has the track record to prove it . He 's had three failures at sitcoms - two " " Don Rickles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Daddy Dearest , " he goes for four . <p> On this show , for the first time in his checkered TV career , Rickles has a co-star to play off . <p> " " We work together and make it funny , " Rickles said . <p> He insults Arabs , Chinese , Japanese , " " fat " women , gays and a few more I forgot to write down - most of them to their faces . <p> They 're his son 's group therapy patients . Rickles ' Al makes Archie Bunker 's bigotry look quaint . <p> That comparison does n't faze him . <p> " " Carroll O'Connor is a dear friend , but I was doing Archie Bunker before Carroll O'Connor did him , " Rickles boasted . " " I was doing that humor in joints and tough clubs , and I was the original Archie Bunker . . . There was nobody in this business doing what I did . When I started that in Florida , it was unheard of . " <p> But Rickles ' insults are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy 's dear wife , soon to be his ex , played by Renee Taylor , is every bit his match in tacky talk . <p> She 's a grandma sex-goddess wannabe , who is looking for thrills in bed . <p> " " It 's all done from humor , " executive producer Jane Milmore responded to the suggestion that some viewers might be offended by the show 's jokes , especially the ethnic slurs . <p> " " The nice thing about Al 's character is that if there are 10 people in the room , he nails all 10 , " said Billy Van Zandt , Milmore 's co-executive producer . The partnership also produced " " Martin " for Fox . <p> " " We have the politically incorrect character and the politically correct character and the two , we hope , will balance out , " Van Zandt said . <p> And apparently , he thinks that bigotry comes naturally to the World War II generation . <p> " " We 've all got relatives who do n't have censor buttons in their heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything 's wrong . Our character of Al fought in World War II , and he 's just that generation . His son by no means feels like that , and will correct him every chance he gets . " <p> Lewis said that Rickles has always made him laugh and he does n't find his humor mean-spirited . <p> The comedians he 's offended by are those who " " separate ethnic groups , and are borderline racist and inflame the situation . " <p> Don does n't do that , Lewis insisted . <p> " " There is no way you can correct people of Don 's generation without having a character like this who speaks like this , " he said . " " I think it 's an important show , and I 'm happy to be part of it , because I will be able to respond to Don and teach Don and hopefully teach viewers that , ' Hey , man , that 's not the way to go . ' " <p> " " My whole act is based on making fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If you can laugh at yourself , that 's the whole thing . . . . I laugh at myself every day , ' cause I 'm a funny guy . " <p> Rockers and Mafia dons <p> What do Sonny and Cher and the Mafia have in common ? <p> They 're all fodder for Fox 's first foray into the big wide world of miniseries . <p> Fox 's in-house movie production company , Fox West Pictures , has bought TV rights to " " And the Beat Goes On , " Sonny Bono 's autobiography . The miniseries will air in at least two two-hour chapters , sometime after September 1994 . <p> " " Bono is very involved in the project , but it was conveyed to me that Cher is not and wo n't be , " Fox West president Rick Bieber said . <p> It wo n't be cast until after the first draft of the script is in , and that will be some time . <p> Another Fox miniseries , " " The Bonnano Family Saga , " is described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in this country , and its relation to the power structure of the U.S.government during the 20th century as seen through the eyes of the renowned Bonnano family . " The word " " crime " is nowhere mentioned in that high-flown description , nor is the word Mafia . <p> Bill Bonnano , the son of the Mafia family , is " " working closely " with Fox , and is the one whose agent made Fox the offer they did n't refuse . Bill 's father , retired don Joe Bonnano , will appear as himself in the movie . <p> " " Bonnano 's being involved could damage the credibility , " Bieber allowed . " " But that is our responsibility , to see that it is authentic . " <p> Other Fox miniseries include " " The Black Whip , " a sci-fi thriller about teens who find aliens living in their own hometown ; " " White Dwarf , " a sci-fi tale from Francis Ford Coppola ; and " " The Richard Pryor Story . " Director/producer John Landis will develop three TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to are : " " The Contessa , " a romantic comedy starring Tea Leoni ; " " Natural Selection , " a science-fiction thriller with actor Kiefer Sutherland as executive producer ; " " Missing Parents , " a comedy about parents who run away from home ; and " " August Fires , " a suspense thriller about a cop who teams with a call girl to find the killer of his partner . <p> Dino doings <p> There 's been talk of a " " Jurassic Park " kiddie cartoon on Fox , but it is n't going to happen . Any time soon , at least . <p> Steven Spielberg decided he does n't want to do it " " now or in the foreseeable future . " <p> " " I can only speculate he did n't want to rush into it , when he 's so busy on his other projects , " said Margaret Loesch , president of Fox Children 's Network . <p> " " If he wants to do it , even two or three years from now , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , I 'd be very disappointed if he did n't do it with us . But he basically has ended the conversation . " <p> Spielberg now has two shows with Fox Children 's Network . <p> " " Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures " is already running , and " " Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs " starts this fall .
