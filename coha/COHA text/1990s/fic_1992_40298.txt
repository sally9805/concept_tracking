Only the art of diplomacy can make First Contact a success . <p> Hazeltine gazed at the pattern taking up half the lobby wall . " Not bad for a coat of paint . " <p> " It 's not paint , " Walsach said . " We do n't know what it is . " <p> " A joke , Ron , " Hazeltine said , but Walsach was n't listening . " ... thought it was monomolecular but it just seems that way . It 's two-three layers integrated somehow , right down on the nuclear level , if not deeper .... " <p> Narrowing his eyes , Hazeltine turned to the pattern again . A pleasing design , once you got used to its essential strangeness . A tangle of lines , some thicker than others , sweeping across the wall in delicate curves that seemed on the verge of falling into a recognizable outline without ever quite doing so . The eye was drawn by it , following the lines from one end to the other . At this distance it seemed dull black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it definitely changed color at irregular intervals . It had been there a little over a week . <p> Walsach had fallen silent and was staring sadly down at the table between them . " So it 's quite advanced , you think ? " Hazeltine asked him . <p> Closing his eyes , Walsach let out a blast of breath , then got up and paced toward the wall . " I 'd like to know where the neutrinos are coming from , I 'd like to know what the power source is , I 'd like to know how it 's modulated , I 'd like to know ... " He sighed . " A few things . " <p> " But it 's unquestionably a signal ? " <p> Walsach swung back to him , a hangdog look on his face . " That 's what Maimonides says . " <p> Hazeltine merely nodded . Walsach was depressed that the team at Maimonides had beaten him to discovering the neutrino pulses . Well , he had nothing to be ashamed of . The work crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing that it was n't artwork put up by the decorators . <p> Tenting his fingers , Hazeltine gazed down at them . " So in effect , we 've been bugged . " <p> Walsach walked back over , shaking his head . " Well , the exo gang does n't want us to jump to conclusions ... " <p> Hazeltine grimaced . He 'd sent the exobiologists packing yesterday ... this morning , on this world , Spinoza . They 'd done nothing but argue , with most of what they had to say nonsense , as far as he was concerned . Aside from that , he 'd seen the carnivals that the various teams , units , and committees had made of the other sites on Maimonides , and Teller and wanted none of it . " But it 's absorbing photons at all wavelengths , and you believe it 's picking up sound as well . " <p> Walsach shrugged . <p> " Your opinion , Ron . " <p> " Mr. Moderator .... " He looked up and smiled . " ... Alex . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were footsteps from the hall and one of the construction crew appeared , a piece of equipment floating behind him . Hazeltine watched with amusement as his steps quickened and he made a wide detour around the pattern . He did n't look in their direction once . " What I do n't understand is why . " Walsach was facing the wall once more , scratching his head . " They want to find out about humans , okay . But why put it in plain sight ? You walk out of the portal and there it is . Hits you right in the eye . " He looked over at Hazeltine . " I mean , they could have hidden it anywhere . " <p> Hazeltine made a sound of agreement . There were plenty of theories among the exo people : a test , a challenge , a puzzle , but no consensus whatever . After all , it had only been a week . A hundred years ago they 'd been thinking in terms of decades and centuries in dealing with a problem like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that we do know , " he said slowly , " is that they are not human . The reason may be incomprehensible in our terms . But whatever it is , we can be sure that in their context it 's a good one . " <p> " I suppose , " Walsach said moodily . A buzz of conversation drifted from the hallway , the construction team going off shift . It died suddenly , the crew emerging in absolute silence , huddled together as they passed . A few gave Hazeltine surly or reproachful looks , and one woman actually glared . Hazeltine simply smiled back at them . They 'd obviously heard that he 'd vetoed any military presence . <p> A moment later they were gone , and he was about to speak when there was a sudden thump of running feet . He turned just as the worker who 'd come through earlier burst around the corner , wild-eyed and out of breath . He skidded to a halt , staring at the two of them in shocked surprise , then nodded nervously as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself from laughing until he 'd gone through . <p> " Well , that 's it , " Walsach said . " Nobody else within fifty lights . " <p> Rising , Hazeltine said , " I believe that Thatcher is forty light-years solward , but a good point nonetheless . " <p> He walked Walsach to the portal . " You 'll be back tomorrow , I assume ? " <p> " Yeah , " Walsach said , scratching his temple . " I 'll want to go over the data with my kids , particularly the stuff from Maimonides , so it might not be early , but .... " He stopped speaking , finger pointed at his skull . " Did you say ' back , ' Mr. Moderator ? " <p> Hazeltine nodded . <p> " You 're not staying out here ? " <p> " Yes , " Hazeltine said . " I have an overwhelming desire to sleep in the director 's suite . I 've never had the opportunity . " <p> Walsach gave a low laugh and shook his head . " Awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He studied Hazeltine 's expression and shrugged . " Well , I guess you know what you 're doing . " <p> Squeezing his arm , Hazeltine smiled . " Tomorrow , then . " Walsach went through without another word . <p> Hazeltine turned and walked to the pattern . He studied the swooping , neargaudy whorls , the seemingly random splash of dots in the center . A chill touched him and he glanced back at the portal as if to assure himself that it was still open . <p> A single step and he could be back on Earth .... He dismissed the thought . Someone had to stay , and he was a moderator , after all . It was n't a matter of choice for him . But even if it had been , he would have made the same decision . He might have doubts , but of this one thing he was sure : The universe was not a hammer aimed at mankind 's head . <p> He gazed at the pattern for another moment then walked to the elevators . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : salad , soup , pasta in cheese sauce . He decided against a glass of wine but ordered a cigar and was disappointed when the system told him none were in stock . Understandable ; the service units were set up only for basic operation until the building was completed . <p> Afterward he got up to take a walk . The station was enormous : five stories high , covering six acres . It had to be big to serve as a center for exploring and exploiting an entire new world . Station was n't quite the word for it , but nobody had come up with anything better . <p> A spiral staircase led to the top floor . He climbed it and looked about him . Still a lot of work to be done : Scattered equipment and material lay up and down the length of the hallway . The far end seemed to be open to the sky , so he walked in that direction . He recalled they were going to have a restaurant here with its own elevator from the lobby .... <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the bare space , not dropping his eyes once . <p> Just above the horizon was a nebula , multicolored and softly glowing , the limbs reaching out to embrace a third of the sky . He stopped at the roof edge , cocking his head as he studied it . No one had told him about this . <p> After a time he looked around . A lot of room here , plenty of space for tables . They 'd probably put in a glass roof , or maybe leave it half open . That 's what he 'd do . <p> Whoever had bought this franchise was one lucky individual . People would come from all over for a sight like this . He smiled to himself . Odd , that something this glorious should be no more than a good reason for a nice night out , the latest marvel on the eating circuit . He wondered if they 'd grasp the sheer magnificence of it , rather doubting they would . <p> He 'd have to find out what the nebula was called . A thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to admiring it when a sound reached him from below . He looked down , stepping back instinctively from the dark abyss at his feet . The outdoor lights had n't been put in yet ; the crew was probably afraid to go out and get it done . <p> The sound came once more , a distant thump , directly beneath him . He eased himself to the edge and looked over but saw nothing more than old night . <p> Local fauna , perhaps , but they were migratory , and there were few large animals in the area now . No other humans around either  --  all the exploration teams had been called in last week . That left Them , but would They come sneaking in under cover of darkness ? <p> Turning on his heel , he headed back for the corridor with one last glance at the shining wonder overhead . <p> He took the stairs down , pausing at every floor to open the door and listen . At basement level he stepped quietly out into the hall . He 'd search here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking slowly , he kept close to the wall before realizing what a silly picture that made . He moved to the center , consciously throwing his head back . <p> There were side corridors branching from the main one . He tried to recall what was down here : the building plant , mostly . Heating , services , comps , supplies , and the portal equipment , of course . He stopped at each corner , listening for a moment before going on . <p> A hundred yards down he heard a clatter behind him . He swung in that direction . It had been muffled , as if coming from behind a wall . Steadying himself , he was about to take a step when another sound came from the way he 'd been headed . He felt a burst of irritation and put his hands on his hips . Wherever the next noise came from , he 'd check there first . <p> Behind him he heard it again . Voices , he was sure of it . He went that way , looking back over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service stairs to the lobby . As he approached it someone up above shouted but the sound was too distorted for him to make out anything . <p> He went up the stairs quickly , pausing at the last step . Several people were out there , speaking in low voices . He waited until they fell silent , then stepped out . <p> Three men stood in the lobby , one in a suit and two in uniform . As Hazeltine appeared , the civilian looked him over , then gestured to the soldiers , who went back to the portal . <p> " Moderator Hazeltine , " the man said as he approached . Hazeltine nodded ; it was n't a question . <p> The man was in his late twenties , blond and thin . Teutonic , either Scandinavian or German . He raised his hand and shook Hazeltine 's without change of expression . " Gunnar Schone , " he said . " I am with  --  " <p> " Security , " Hazeltine said . He swept an arm toward the chairs and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad that you heard us , " he said . " The intercom is not yet working and I did not wish to search the building without permission . " <p> Hazeltine smiled wordlessly . Quite definitely German ; a Saxon , from the accent . <p> Head turned , Schone eyed the pattern . " That is the artifact ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> A quizzical grimace crossed Schone 's face . " It does n't lock like much . But ... to business . " He dropped into a chair . The blue eyes snapped to Hazeltine . " I take it you have heard of Humanite , Herr Moderator ? " <p> " I have . " Humanite : an extremist outfit started during the panic caused by the Great Invader Hoax fifty years before . <p> Schone nodded . " Then I need not go into detail . We have evidence that the organization has learned of the artifact and is planning to take action . " <p> " Ca n't you handle that earthside ? I 'd always assumed that Humanite had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Moderator . They have been , but not completely . They are arranged in a cell structure , and we do not have full access . Aside from which , they were considered of little importance . " His eyes moved to the pattern once more . " Until now , of course . " <p> " So ? " <p> " Our contacts tell us that the organization may have considerably more expertise than we had thought .... " <p> Hazeltine shifted in the seat . " What are you saying ? " <p> " According to informants , the group is capable of reprogramming the portals . " <p> " No , " Hazeltine said . " That 's ridiculous . I 'd heard they had wealthy backers , but the equipment alone must cost .... " <p> " I 'm afraid , Herr Hazeltine , " Schone said wearily , " that they have infiltrated the operational staff . " <p> Hazeltine flung up his hands . " Well , that 's just lovely . So much for the occupational testing , I guess . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Moderator . " Hazeltine gazed up at him . " So what 's the point ? " As if he needed to ask . <p> Schone folded his arms . " We would like to emplace an armed security unit at this station . " He stared at Hazeltine emotionlessly . <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> " Herr Moderator  --  " Schone began . <p> " The subject is closed , Mr. Schone . It would be the worst possible move just after we 've discovered the nature of the patterns . And besides , I saw the chaos at the other sites . Everybody and his dog shambling around , half with weapons .... " There was a slight flicker in Schone 's expression . " Or are they ? " <p> " I 'll be frank with you , " Schone said . " Sung and Morris followed your lead . They sent back all armed units today . " <p> " Well , that 's it then , Mr. Schone . " Hazeltine opened his hands . " Is there anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a monitoring system ? " <p> Pointing at the pattern , Hazeltine said , " If you can guarantee that it wo n't be detected by that . " <p> Schone nodded grimly . " Very well , then . " He rose and headed for the portal . <p> Hazeltine got up to follow . Before going through , Schone took a last look at the pattern . " You know , " he said . " I 've considered the fact that this may be another Jefferson affair .... " <p> " I doubt it , " Hazeltine said . " From what I 've heard of that thing 's capabilities , anyone creating it would earn himself immortality from that alone . He would n't need any hoaxes . " <p> Schone changed the subject . " You truly plan to stay overnight here . " <p> " Absolutely . " <p> A look of distant amusement crossed Schone 's face . " If you need assistance , just come across . I 'll be on duty . " <p> " I 'll do that , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then sighed and turned away . <p> It was still dark when he got up . After he shaved and washed , he ordered a cup of coffee and took it to the roof . <p> There was a thick cluster of stars where the nebula had been : bluewhite , close enough so that he could have sworn they showed disks . He looked in the direction that might as well be called east , and there it was , even more glorious than he remembered . <p> Just beneath the nebula a barely perceptible line of light crossed the horizon , outlining the webbed crowns of what passed for trees here . A short while and the sun would be rising beneath that massive , glowing jewel . His heart began to beat faster . Sunrise would last more than an hour here , with this world 's slow rotation . He sipped from the cup . He 'd checked the basement again last night to find everything quiet and all doors locked . There had been no more noises before he 'd gone to sleep ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was glad he had n't mentioned the matter to Schone . Not that the agent could have done much about it , but Hazeltine had no real idea what impact such information might have . Home portal had been forted up unbelievably when he 'd come through  --  beam platforms , special action units , at least two airborne armored brigades . The Peacekeepers were out in force , and if they demanded a formal emergency , they just might get it . <p> And then a moderator 's word would be no better than that of anyone else . He wondered which side Federov would come down on . Great Russians were extremely hard to read , and he 'd talked to the commissioner for only a few moments after he 'd been briefed . <p> He turned his gaze to the darkness around him , wondering what eyes might be looking back . Something unimaginable , perhaps , using a form of vision stranger than he could name . It struck him that they might be able see him clearly even in this light , and he raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm drop once more . And beyond them , the paranoid , tormented eyes of men of his own world . He felt a twist of dismay at what would happen if the Humanite fanatics found the aliens first ; a greater disaster he could not imagine . Maybe he should call in security for a quick sweep of the area .... But no , you do n't solve problems by increasing the number of variables . <p> He 'd looked over the station db for all the data available on the group and had been surprised at the amount that came up . They 'd arisen just after the invader hoax , that asinine piece of self-promotion by Wallace Njoma , a professional celebrity on Jefferson . Fake artifacts suddenly appearing out of nowhere , tailored to portray the makers as a mad , vicious , militaristic race devoted to war and destruction . Hazeltine had been a boy then , and he could recall the panicky broadcasts on Worldnet , particularly after the first " translations " had turned up , declaring that the entire area around Tau Ceti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call themselves , and God help any other race that ever occupied them . Among the stars they held title to was an insignificant ball called Sol . <p> Humanite had mushroomed forth then , dedicated to defending the human race against the Ree and all other comers . A politician had been behind it , needless to say  --  a Montenegrin named Bostijic . After Njoma had revealed that it was only an amusing hoax , most public support had evaporated , but the hard core remained : the congenital xenophobes , men who in an earlier age would have joined forgotten cults like the IRA , the Klan , the Know-Nothings . They had gone underground , convinced that even though this crisis had been a false alarm , there would always be a next time .... <p> Hazeltine downed the rest of the coffee . And here was the next time . <p> The glow on the horizon had spread and taken on the color of dull gold . Above it the nebula hung like God 's own handprint . He wondered if it would be visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those dark , strange woods , what did they feel at the sight ? Simple indifference , most likely , if not outright horror . There were plenty who looked at the stars in just that way : not part of the world at all , an abyss , the very dark source of fear . What they would make of another race rising out of that bleak pit was n't worth thinking about . <p> There came a sound from below : somebody hollering . A minute later he heard running footsteps . He went over and looked down the stairwell . <p> A mournful voice floated up : " Alex ? " <p> " Here , " Hazeltine called . More footsteps and then a brown face gazed up at him . " Jeez , " Walsach said . " I did n't know what happened . " <p> Hazeltine smiled down at him . " Come on up , " he called softly . " There 's something you should see . " <p> Hazeltine sat in the lobby reading the paper . Walsach had brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grateful . Not much going on ; the Council had decided to keep a lid on the artifacts for the time being . <p> As he discarded the front page for the arts section , two workmen walked past . " ... like to scrape that thing off , " one said . Nigerian , probably a Yoruba . <p> " Oooh , no mon , " the other replied , dreadlocks swinging . " You try that it jump from the wall and chase you right quick . " <p> He was opening the paper when another worker advanced on him . A muscular , hearty young woman , blond hair cut short . The same , in fact , who had glared at him last night . <p> " Mr. Moderator ... ? " American ? <p> " Alex . " <p> She eyed him a moment . " Alex . You have n't been down in the supply room , have you ? " <p> Canadian , Hazeltine decided . " No , I have n't . What 's wrong ? " <p> She blinked nervously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , like somebody dropped it . " <p> Hazeltine set the paper down . " I see . What kind ? " <p> " Crackers , dried fruit , some cans . " She bit her lip . <p> " No , I was n't down there . " <p> " Okay , " she said as she walked off . A few steps on she looked over her shoulder . " And thanks , sir . " <p> Hazeltine watched until she went around the corner . The supply room , just off the main corridor .... The aliens had taken a few things earlier , evidently ; at least some were missing . But he doubted they 'd developed a taste for crackers . <p> Clearing his throat , he stated his code and stared into the air before him . Nothing appeared , not even the shimmer effect that occurred when the lasers needed tuning . He grunted and got up . Obviously the central comp was n't online .... <p> He reddened as he looked across the lobby to see Walsach smiling at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just in a couple suites . " He waved Hazeltine over . " Come on . We 're hooked in . " <p> " Anything in particular ? " Walsach asked as they went down the hall . <p> " Yes , " Hazeltine muttered . They reached the suite and went inside . " Go ahead , " Walsach told him . " It 's on me . " <p> Hazeltine glanced about at Walsach 's team before speaking . They were paying no attention , busy at various machines . <p> " Supplies , " he said after stating his code . " Food , amounts ordered . " <p> The hologrammed words flashed into being . " Last night , all orders , " Hazeltine said , aware of Walsach 's gaze . <p> A list glowed at him , the first line his own dinner , with others below it . He looked it over . Nine meals : two ham , four steak , and three chicken , one of them curried . <p> " Other items missing . " Another list , displaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Orders for the past week , time of day appended . " A longer list appeared , most of them lunches for the workers , but there , three days back , another night order , nine hot meals with a far greater amount of dry and canned goods . <p> He was about to exit when another thought occurred to him . " How were these ordered ? " The holo displayed a takeout symbol . <p> " Thank you , " Hazeltine said . The image vanished and he turned to see Walsach gazing at him in full comprehension . <p> " There 's somebody else out here , " Walsach said quietly . <p> Hazeltine dropped his eyes . He should call in security . He had no choice , really . Those sick fanatics were a matter for other skills than his . But .... <p> He raised his head . " Could you set up a detection system for me ? Rudimentary . No need for flash . " <p> Walsach frowned at him . " I could , Alex , but .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " <p> Just then the foreman walked in , a worried look on her face . <p> After he showered , Hazeltine went directly downstairs . He knew that he should eat something , but he was far too nervous . In the elevator he took out the beeper that Walsach had given him and looked it over . It had been slapped together by the team 's hardware man and stuffed into a plastic calculator case . He shook it gingerly , hearing the circuitry and receiver rattle inside . Extremely crude , nothing like what Schone would have put in , but that was exactly the point . All the same , Walsach had assured him it would work . <p> At least the foreman 's problem was taken care of . It seemed that the supply room story had spread and the crew was about ready to drop its tools and head home en masse . A pretty situation , but one made for Hazeltine . <p> He 'd gone from site to site to speak to them . He 'd stumbled at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honed over the years , kept sending him mixed signals . Finally he simply relaxed and spoke straightforwardly : that he had reasons for wanting them here , that these beings should see humanity as it was and not behind masks designed by scientists or governments however well-intentioned they might be , that in a real way it was they who would be making the contact , and that he was only their spokesman . He asked , without pleading , that they not let fear rule them , that it was crucial , perhaps desperately so , that the aliens know that humanity was not afraid of them . He ended by telling them that whatever happened , they would never regret being where they were now . <p> It had been enough . They 'd gone back to work , all but the handful who had already snuck home . <p> Tired as he was , he still felt the emotional high of a successful commission . That was what moderators were for , after all : calming touchy situations , settling disputes , acting as freelance negotiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it  --  colony to colony , world to world : Palestinians versus Poles , Chinese versus Californians , Cubans versus Mexicans . A tough one , that last  --  fruit of a half-witted UN project devised by a bureaucrat who believed that all Latins were alike . He 'd had to settle there  --  Bolivar , the world was called  --  for over six months . But it had turned out well ; they 'd wanted to appoint him alcalde when it was over . <p> As he crossed the lobby he looked outside . Dusk : the sun vanished , the light of the nebula not yet visible . He went on through the portal , finding exactly what he 'd expected : droves of security men and soldiers armed with everything except shields and spears . Looking around , he saw Schone talking to a Peacekeeper officer . He walked over and tapped him on the shoulder when he finished . <p> Schone turned , showing no surprise whatsoever . <p> " Could you arrange for a small unit to be ready at any time ? Men you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Schone said slowly . <p> " Excellent . I 'll discuss it with you later . " <p> " Wait , " Schone said . Hazeltine looked back . " You found something . " <p> " Nothing in particular . " <p> " Yes , you did , " Schone said . The blue eyes were cold and unblinking . He grasped Hazeltine by the arm . " Is it humans , or .... " <p> Hazeltine gazed back calmly and Schone let him go . <p> " Later , then , " Hazeltine said , and walked to the portal . <p> The alarm started beeping as soon as he emerged . <p> He turned and plunged back . Schone was standing where he 'd left him , talking to one of his men . This time he did look surprised . It was nice to see an honest expression on that face , Hazeltine thought as he waved and went back through . <p> Schone was right behind him , pistol in hand , followed by a dozen uniformed men . " No shooting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless I give the signal . " <p> He could read the look that crossed Schone 's face . Moderators never gave that kind of signal . <p> " Do you know where the food supply is kept ? " Schone 's head moved once and he snapped his fingers behind him . " Outside , " he said , and six of the men ran toward the doors . The others ran in good order to the service stairs , Hazeltine right behind them . At the door Schone looked back . " You will wait  --  " he began , but Hazeltine went on past him . <p> There was , a clatter from below and a cry of , " Goddammit ! " Shouts and running feet sounded from the corridor . Schone pushed him aside and ran downstairs . Taking two steps at a time , Hazeltine followed . <p> At the bottom , a soldier was rubbing his leg and swearing at an overturned machine just outside the door . He picked up his gun and hobbled toward the uproar . Hazeltine quickly overtook him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying boxes were pushing through the exit door . The troops spread out against the walls , weapons raised . In the middle of the corridor , Schone stood aiming his pistol . <p> " No ! " Hazeltine shouted . He raced past him and swung around . Schone muttered a curse and lowered the gun . Turning away Hazeltine saw that two of the men had already vanished . The third was fumbling between his load and the closed door . <p> " Young man , " Hazeltine shouted . The boy looked wildly back , then let the boxes drop and raised a machine pistol , the barrel short and ugly . <p> Hazeltine inspected him in the dim light . Middle Eastern , one of the most tormented and racially paranoid regions of Earth . The boy cocked the gun and shook it at him . " Get away , " he shouted in heavily accented English . <p> Syrian , possibly the Iraqi border area . Arabic cultural matrix : patriarchal in basis , hierarchical in structure , authoritarian in nature . Harsh and peremptory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hazeltine paced toward him . " I am a moderator , " he said . " Whatever it is , it 's ended . Drop the weapon and we 'll discuss it . " <p> The boy 's face twisted and he started cursing in Arabic . Hazeltine caught little of it ; not his specialty . He halted twenty feet away . Let him rage for a moment , get it out of his system . <p> The boy fell silent and glared past him to where the soldiers stood . Hazeltine took another step . " Put the gun down , boy . " He pointed at the floor . " Do it now . " <p> Licking his lips , the boy dropped his eyes . Hazeltine waited , hand still raised . Let him make up his own mind . <p> The eyes rose and locked with his . " You ... , " the boy said , his voice barely audible . <p> " I am a moderator . " <p> He could see the boy relaxing . If it was a moderator it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He bent forward and set the gun on the concrete floor . <p> Hazeltine crooked his finger . " Come here . " <p> The boy came to him , nearly trotting . Hazeltine took his arm and led him down the corridor . " What is your name ? " <p> " Hafaz Aziz , " the boy mumbled . <p> The soldiers had risen from firing stance , some smiling , one or two shaking their heads . As always , Schone 's expression was unreadable . <p> In the lobby , Hazeltine claimed privilege in order to talk to the boy first . " There are nine of you , " he said , " within easy walking distance of the station . And not very well trained , I 'm afraid . " <p> The boy 's eyes widened and he looked away quickly . Hazeltine could guess what was going through that black-haired head of his  --  that he should have handled it differently , that with a little more guts and finesse he might have taken Hazeltine hostage , brazened his way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation did n't quite match up with his self-image , and it was hurting him . <p> " We also know who you are and what you 're up to , " Hazeltine went on . Aziz simply pouted . <p> Hazeltine looked over his shoulder . A few feet off stood a cold-faced Schone along with a Ukrainian Peacekeeper general in special-forces uniform . The lobby had been overrun with brass when they 'd returned . Hazeltine had chased all the others back home . <p> He turned back to the boy . " We know that you 've been hunting the aliens and have n't had any luck .... " <p> Black eyes snapped toward him . " The beasts , " the boy spat . " Beasts ? How so ? " <p> There was no reply . " Then perhaps you 'd tell me what the point is ? What possible good you could accomplish ? " <p> " Someone must defend our home against these beings , " the boy said fiercely . He must have realized how silly that sounded . " ... to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make clear the evil of these creatures .... " <p> " And if they 're not evil ? " <p> " Then they must know of our power . " <p> Hazeltine could barely keep his eyes from rolling . " Power , " he said . " So it comes down to that . " <p> The boy blinked at him uncomprehendingly . " I suppose that you refuse to tell us where your group is camped ? " asked Hazeltine . There was a disgusted " Oh , Christ " from behind him as the boy shook his head . Hazeltine rose and waved Schone and the officer aside . <p> The general smiled dourly at him . " Moderator , " he said in pure Midwestern American , " with your permission I 'll dope that punk , hook him up to a Veritex , and squeeze it right out of him . " <p> " And how long will that take ? " <p> " No more than  --  " the general began just as Schone said , " An hour . " Glaring at the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And yet we have at least two of his people on their way back . You certainly do n't expect them to wait for you . " <p> The general looked uncomfortably at Schone . Turning to where the boy waited , Hazeltine gestured for them to follow . <p> He loomed over Aziz , staring down at him coldly , letting his gaze sink in . " You 're not aware that we have some idea where the aliens are , " he said finally . " These men want to drop you there . We believe that the beasts , as you call them , would like to examine a specimen . " He stepped away , bobbing his head briskly . " General .... " <p> No ! " Aziz shrieked , leaping to his feet . He stared wildly around him , his arms up . He fixed his eyes on Hazeltine and began babbling , a mixture of Arabic and English : a notch in the ridge west of here , a mile past that to a stream , then a grove of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors and the lift platforms that waited outside . " No gunplay , " Hazeltine called out . The officer raised an arm as he vanished . <p> Aziz was being led to the portal , sobbing wretchedly . Hazeltine turned away . He eyed the pattern for a moment and with a shame-faced smile went to a chair . <p> " ... betray your own race , " the man said , his voice and gestures operatic . " You disgust me . " At the last word he spat on the carpet . <p> " Not worth an answer , Padilla , " Hazeltine said softly . <p> He was big , mustached , and as worn-out and dirty as the rest of his men . Hector Padilla , a well-to-do krill rancher from Baja . One of his wife 's relatives was a portal tech . He 'd sent the group through from Hidalgo five days before ; the rest they 'd learn soon enough . There had been no casualties , not a shot fired other than a single stun grenade . The timing could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply raiders had returned , with confusion at its height . <p> " ... eh , we tried , " Padilla muttered to himself . <p> " You could have tried harder . The operation seemed a bit ill-planned , to tell you the truth . " <p> Padilla glared at him . " It would have gone better if you had n't stolen our supplies . I knew then that you .... " <p> Keeping the surprise from his face , Hazeltine glanced around the lobby . No one in earshot : Most of the troops were hustling Padilla 's men through the portal . He looked back at Padilla , who was still orating . <p> " ... why you did n't pick us up then , I do n't know . Playing games , I guess . " <p> Hazeltine nodded distractedly . At the portal , Schone pointed toward Padilla and two soldiers came over . " Well , yes .... " Hazeltine said , his voice drifting off . Padilla saw the soldiers approaching and got up . Striking a dramatic pose , he fixed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't regret this , Moderator . I pray for us all . " <p> Hazeltine stifled a grin . " My thanks , Senor . " As Padilla stepped away , he said , " One thing more . " <p> The Mexican looked back . <p> " Tell me , did you ever watch the nebula at night ? " <p> A puzzled look crossed Padilla 's face . " Si . What about it ? " <p> Hazeltine waved him on . " Buenas noches . " <p> As Padilla was led away , Schone walked over , wearing the look of mild amusement that was as close as he ever got to a smile . " Alex , " he said , extending his hand . " I hope the rest works out as well . " <p> " Perhaps better . " <p> He watched Schone go across , then slowly made his way to the pattern . There was a reddish sheen to it now , and for some reason it looked almost cheerful , as if it were a mild joke shared between friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied it , thinking that he had gotten the joke . <p> They would want to learn how we handle our madmen , he thought . Of course they would . That would tell them all they needed to know . " I 'm ready , " he told the pattern , and walked toward the doors . Before he even reached them he saw movement out in the darkness and his heart leapt at the magic of it . He smiled , the way a man smiles when a great act awaits , but erased it when he recalled what the exo team had told him about bared teeth . Then he let it grow once more . They must know what a smile was by now . <p> The movement became clearer and Hazeltine slowed in astonishment that was washed away a second later . But yes , he told himself . They would look exactly like that , would n't they ? <p> Quickening his step , Hazeltine opened the door and walked out into the warm embrace of evening . <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
