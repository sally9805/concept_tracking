There were no tears for John Sununu last week . Not in Washington , not in his home state of New Hampshire  --  least of all at the White House , whose staff he has terrorized with personal insults and paranoid suspicions over the past two years . " This is the time when you expect 40 people to stand up and say , ' I know John Sununu , and he would never violate the public trust . ' But you do n't hear that , do you ? " asked a senior administration official . " That 's because John has violated one of the first rules of politics : Do n't make enemies you do n't need to make . " <P> So many enemies has Sununu collected that Washington 's favorite guessing game last week was which one stabbed the chief of staff in the back by leaking details of his travels . The answer seems to be that initial inquiries into Sununu 's flights were not suggested by leaks , but once reporters started asking questions , plenty of eager tipsters emerged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted in part by signs that his family ( which includes eight children , two still residing at home ) was living at the edge of its means yet managed to take regular skiing trips to Colorado and New Hampshire . Reporters at the Post , whose lead was followed by U.S. News &; World Report , insist they got their scoop by observing that Sununu was an unusually frequent traveler and by demanding his records from the Pentagon . But once Sununu 's detractors got wind of the investigation , says a Post staffer , " they called to cheer us on "  --  and to provide more details . <P> After the first stories broke , officials unfriendly to Sununu quietly pushed a second , more damaging wave of allegations : Sununu not only made excessive use of Air Force planes , but when he traveled to ski resorts to give speeches , he sometimes also accepted free lodging , lift tickets and airfare for his wife . Such charges embarrassed the ethics-sensitive Bush Administration , while + providing a tempting target for Sununu 's many enemies . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sununu suspected he had been knifed by Chuck Douglas , a Concord Republican whom Sununu and his wife Nancy , now a G.O.P. operative in Washington , personally dislike and worked hard to defeat in his bid for re-election to Congress last year . Republican Governor Judd Gregg also loathes Sununu and blames him for leaving behind a major budget deficit . " It may come as a surprise to people in Washington , " says one of Sununu 's friends in New Hampshire , " but John has as many enemies here as there . " <P> The Budget Boys . During last fall 's deficit-reduction talks , Sununu 's high- handed style greatly offended the old bulls of Congress . The last straw for Senator Robert Byrd , the powerful West Virginia Democrat , came when Sununu plopped his feet onto the conference table and read newspapers while the others negotiated . " Your conduct is arrogant , " Byrd thundered . " It is rude . " And he vowed that Sununu would live to regret it .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
