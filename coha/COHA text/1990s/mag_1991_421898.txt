The National Park Service plans to revive a defunct West town . <p> THE NEW PAVER , one of the oldest rivers in North America despite its name , winds through the Fayette County plateau in West Virginia , carving its steep gorge with grand , sweeping curves . Perched on a narrow spit of land in one of the curves lies the town of Thurmond . Scattered buildings , mostly empty now , cling to the hillside above and line the railroad track that separates the town from the river . A passing train rattles these decaying buildings , a reminder of the days when Thurmond produced more revenue for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad than Richmond and Cincinnati combined . <p> The Park Service sees in this legendary town , which is within the New River Gorge National River , an opportunity to bring the glory days of railroading alive again . And , if all goes as planned , Thurmond will become a major cultural and educational attraction in the park  --  famous for its white-water rafting . " The New River gorge stands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's a world of history and culture here , too , " says Joe Kennedy , park superintendent . <p> " This is one place where we can tell the story of the history of railroading and its connection to coal mining in the gorge , " says Linda Romola of the Park Service , who is working on the Thurmond developmental concept plan . " The fact that the town has n't changed much makes it an excellent opportunity . " In a broader sense , the story of the gorge is a microcosm of the history of the United States , says Andy Kardos , former chief of interpretation at New River . Initially , the area was isolated wilderness , used by the few settlers primarily for agriculture . Then coal was discovered , and the railroad came through in 1873 , bringing people and prosperity . But as coal disappeared and technology changed , the industry declined and the area slowly returned to wilderness . Now , with the modem emphasis on recreation , a new industry  --  the service industry  --  is growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States has gone , " Kardos says , " from agricultural nation to industrial nation to service industry . And Thurmond can tell that story in a straightforward way . " <p> Thurmond 's role in the gorge today is the same as it was historically-an access point to the river , first for goods , now for recreation . And soon it will be a gateway to history . " When you go to Thurmond , " says South District Interpreter Don Kodak , " you can very easily imagine yourself back in time . " That time would be somewhere in the early 20th century , boom time in New River country . The future site of Thurmond was a forbidding piece of wilderness when Captain William Dabney Thurmond acquired it in 1873 . But he knew the two creeks opposite the site offered natural access into the gorge . Following the path of least resistance , the railroad snaked through the gorge , eventually finding the passage created by the creeks . A railroad bridge was completed 100 yards upstream from Thurmond across the New River to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future as a strategic rail junction . During its heyday , Thurmond was among the most important railroad centers on the C &O.; <p> For most of its years , Thurmond could be reached only by train . In his book , Thurmond : A New River Community , Ken Sullivan writes that the passenger depot , the first building to greet people crossing the bridge , is one of the more important buildings in Thurmond . Built in 1904 , the depot is a two-story woodframe example of classic railroad architecture . Inside was the ticket agent 's office , flanked by separate waiting rooms , one for white men and one for white women . Black passengers shared a single waiting room farther down near the baggage room . The floor above included the signal tower , which projected out for a clear view of the eastbound and westbound tracks . Visitors to Thurmond will stop here first to learn about the history and evolution of the railroad industry in the region  --  from 1873 when the railroad first went in to present day . <p> Despite nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kardos says , but is in need of repair . Unfortunately , it is not the Park Service 's to rehabilitate . The depot and the other historic buildings in the railyard are owned by CSX Corporation , which still runs freight trains on the track and has one employee working out of the depot . It is also a passenger stop for Amtrak . The Park Service has been negotiating with CSX for three years to acquire the depot , engine house , and two water towers that are an integral part of the Thurmond story . Without these buildings , the Park Service 's interpretive program will have to rely more on photos and exhibits . <p> " Basically it comes down to : Why are we there if we do n't have all the pieces to show the character of the area ? " Romola says . One of the wrinkles in ' acquiring the buildings is liability ; CSX is concerned about the safety of tourists near working railroad tracks . The Park Service is developing ways to deal with the problem , such as putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confi , dent they will reach an agreement soon . " It 's hard ; they have more lawyers than we do , " Kennedy says . " We 'll just have to take it one step at a time . " <p> In the meantime , the buildings are slipping away . " It 's frustrating because the money has been allocated to rehabilitate the buildings , but we do n't own them , " Romola says . " The external part of the engine house is basically shot . One of our biggest concerns is that we 'll lose it before we get it . " The engine house , one of the most dilapidated buildings , is also one of the most significant , Kardos says . " In the age of steam , an enormous amount of labor was needed to keep the railroad going . So the engine house is a key part of the historic fabric of Thurmond . It is why Thurmond existed . " <p> This massive building , also known as the roundhouse despite its rectangular shape , anchors the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end by two tracks . It was a repair shop and inspection station , in addition to being the unofficial headquarters for off-duty crews , says Sullivan . Much of Thurmond 's economy was built upon the crewing needs and short service intervals of steam locomotives . <p> The Park Service plans to house large exhibits , like railroad cars and engines , in the engine house , focusing on the operation of the railroad in both the steam and the diesel days . Historic exhibits , together with modern trains running through town , offer a rare opportunity to illustrate the changes in railroad technology and how these changes affect people and economies . " It is very interesting to have an active railroad line , the same one that existed at the time of Thurmond 's heyday , " Kardos says . " Especially since it is a diesel engine , which is what helped bring about the close of the coal mines and Thurmond . " <p> It 's a short walk from the depot to the commercial district . Because of limited land and the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built along , and practically within arm 's reach of , the railroad tracks . Farther up the hillside , but still within walking distance , are more houses and a white clapboard church . About 50 people live in Thurmond and the surrounding area , some of whom were instrumental in piecing together the town 's story . " An advantage to doing the cultural history of Thurmond is that the change from a major railroad town has occurred within the living memory of many residents , " Sullivan says . " One gentleman in his 80s , who used to work in the depot , walked through the depot and described to us what it looked like and what was going on in each room when he worked there in the ' 20s and ' 30s . " Another resident of Thurmond is a park ranger , who keeps an eye on things from his home on the C &O.; " I have a railroad track about 20 feet from the back wall of my apartment , " says Dave Bartlett . " The train actually rattles the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings  --  all that is left of the commercial row  --  owned by the Park Service . The three-story Mankin-Cox Building , built in 1904 , housed doctor and pharmacist offices and later the New River Banking and Trust Company . The Mankin Building marked the city limits , with everything to the right officially in the town of Glen Jean . The Goodman-Kincaid Building erected in 1906 is , literally , a shell of its former self , but it once housed a restaurant , clothing stores , a doctor 's office , and apartments . And the 1917 four-story National Bank of Thurmond building contained the bank founded by the Thurmond family , the Western Union Telegraph Company offices , and apartments . In the business district , the Park Service will teach visitors about the growth , success , and subsequent decline of the town as well as its relationship to the outside world . For instance , the Park Service would like to show how industry brought to the area an enormous change in society , both economically and ethnically . This small town , which never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an impressive cross-section of races and classes . <p> " Thurmond is particularly interesting because people think of the Appalachians as a place of isolation where people are quilting and making moonshine , " says Kardos . " Industrial Appalachia is much different because of the railroad . It brought modern industrial society and all the communication links , such as daily papers from large cities , to the outside world . " <p> Thurmond 's thriving commercial district was , of course , much more than these three buildings in its salad days , even though the town lacked a main street . After an official post office was established in 1889 , the riverside town grew steadily . Sullivan writes in his book that by 1895 , the population was about 75 and there were at least a half-dozen businesses , including Western Union , two general stores , and the offices of two coal companies . By 1898 , the population grew to 175 , and Thurmonders enjoyed another store , a restaurant , a saloon , two milliners , a lawyer , shoemaker , jeweler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a second hotel filled in the holes , creating a tight row of brick facades on the " main street " of the C &O; Railway . <p> The Hotel Thurmond was an impressive 35-room brick hotel with seven bathrooms , steam heat , and 400 electric lights powered by its own generator . But it was the Dun Glen Hotel , built in 1901 , that helped earn Thurmond the reputation of being the Dodge City of New River country . The rambling , three-and-a-half story , 100-room building across the river from Thurmond was where big deals were struck and good liquor drunk . Society dances and orchestra concerts , as well as less genteel parties and high-stakes gambling , were common at the hotel . One poker game at Dun Glen is rumored to have lasted 14 years . And the hotel bar reportedly never closed from 1901 until state prohibition took effect in 1914 . <p> To protect Thurmond from the evils of alcohol , the Town of Thurmond , in which no saloons would be allowed , was incorporated in 1903 . To protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town of Glen Jean were extended to include the hotel . It was this area , known locally as " Ballyhack , " in which flourished the saloons , houses of prostitution , and general lawlessness for which Thurmond was blamed . Throughout the years , the stories grew until Thurmond was known as a place where murders were an almost everyday occurrence , and a nearby preacher was moved to remark that " the only difference between Thurmond and hell is that a river runs through Thurmond . " <p> In researching his book , Sullivan looked at crime records and other official records to get an idea of the violence of the place . " Thurmond was an exciting place with hundreds of people passing through daily and a lot of action . It was a colorful place that probably did have a lot of brawling . I think a combination of all that led to the stories that got exaggerated as they were passed along . I think there was just enough fire there to make some smoke . " <p> Thurmond continued to boom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but change had begun to erode its position of power . Good roads in the New River country meant that it was no longer necessary for regional distribution centers to be on a mainline railroad . In addition , with the completion of other rail lines , Thurmond gradually lost its monopoly as a main coal stop and repair center . The town 's economic decline accelerated as the gorge was mined out and coal production dropped . <p> Furthermore , Thurmond had always been nearly helpless against fire and , in November 1922 , was struck in its Achilles heel . It lost a major business center and the frame building housing a dry goods and grocery operation , as well as a mortuary , drugstore , shoe shop , movie theater , and several apartments over the businesses . Smaller fires continued to eat away at Thurmond , and in 1930 the Dun Glen Hotel burned to the ground . " One area that was hard to get a fix on was the burning of the Dun Glen Hotel ; everyone kind of danced away from the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a case of arson , and it 's not settled in the community 's mind how to view it . " <p> Throughout the 1930s , banks and businesses failed or moved to larger communities . The railroad was all that was left to Thurmond , which kept the town alive for the next two decades . But as sleek new diesels replaced the familiar steam engines on the C &O,; Thurmond continued its steady decline . A final fire in 1963 took the Armour building and the once-proud Hotel Thurmond , reducing the town 's business row to three brick buildings . <p> For the first time in decades , Thurmond is experiencing a slight revival because of the popularity of rafting on the New River . The Park Service hopes to give the area an economic boost by promoting Thurmond as an attraction and reviving the historic commercial buildings into concession-run , working businesses . " Economic revitalization was going to happen anyway , " Sullivan says . " What was n't going to happen was any organized plan to preserve and interpret the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is regulate the revival of the town as a recreational and especially as a historical asset . " <p> Turning Thurmond into a tourist attraction naturally will affect the character and quiet of the community , though some may welcome the distractions . " It 's boring , " says one 10-year resident of the town . " The train coming through is about the most interesting thing that happens all day . " <p> Bartlett reports a mixed opinion about the Park Service 's plan . " A lot of the folks are real Thurmondites  --  they like Thurmond the way it is . Others realize that if it stays as is , it might be gone in 50 years . Overall , I think there 's a real positive attitude . " <p> But for now , Thurmond remains a virtual ghost town , with the empty railyard buildings and former businesses retreating farther into the past . " It 's like living in history , " says Bartlett . " I hear the ghost stories about Thurmond , but I have n't heard or seen anything that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the train . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The railroad , which crosses the New River on its way to Thurmond , brought diversity and prosperity to the community . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The passenger depot , built in 1904 and still used by Amtrak , is the first stop in Thurmond for visitors by rail . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The coaling tower is a relic from a bygone era .
