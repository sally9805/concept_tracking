<p> The sandhill crane opened its grey wings five feet wide and lifted up out of the wooded wetland , circling over the Metra commuter train heading west . <p> Further down the line , a small hawk , hunting , hovered over a stubble cornfield , as earthmoving equipment rumbled across a nearby lot on a recent , sunny afternoon . <p> The train pulled in at Aurora 's restored central train station in the Kane County country . The southern end of the county is a lot of land with a river running through it . <p> " That bird represents the natural resources that we are seeking to preserve , " said Phillip Bus , executive director of the Kane County Development Department . <p> The southern end of the Fox River Valley is a wealth of land and nature that spreads up from the river attracting new settlers to such suburbs as Batavia , Geneva and St. Charles , with their quaint shops , antique stores and restaurants . <p> Balancing act Once a getaway destination for city dwellers , the Fox Valley has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature areas such as Fabyan Forest Preserve in Geneva . <p> " Our population will be approximately 500,000 by the year 2020 , " Bus said . " And we are about 350,000 right now . " <p> Kane County is holding public hearings on a plan to try to balance the needs of its growing population with the natural resources , businesses and industry that draw them . The plan can accommodate an additional 150,000 above the predicted half-million . <p> " Municipalities have to have room to make their decisions and the real estate industry has to have some flexibility in terms of choice and freedom of location , " Bus said . <p> At the same time , the plan indicates that more than 50 percent of the county will still be in agricultural uses , he said . " There is a lot of land in Kane County . About 425 square miles are unincorporated out of 522 . About 65 percent of the county right now is in farm land . " <p> A majority of that growth will occur in the municipalities as they annex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along the Fox River . <p> " We do n't end up with conventional urban sprawl west of the Fox River , " he said . " Suburban sprawl is kind of like pornography . It 's different to everybody but you know it when you see it . " <p> Bob , Betty , Bob and Betty Betty and Bob Boss are back in Geneva . <p> " We lived in Geneva for 25 years , " she said . " Then we went south for four years but we got homesick and came back . " <p> Betty and Bob 's friends Betty and Bob Griffith bought a ranch-style unit in the Georgetown II town house development just east of Randall Road in Batavia . <p> " We liked it so much , we went right over and bought the one like it , " Betty Boss said . " It 's all on one floor . We liked the looks of the development right away . " <p> " It 's a wonderful location , " she added . " It 's on McKee and Western near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target , and the post office . " <p> The town house-style condominiums in Georgetown II sold so well that Jerry O'Connor , president of J. B. O'Connor and Co. , did n't have time or need to put up models for Georgetown III . <p> In addition to first-time buyers , such as young couples and singles , the town houses are appealing to " empty-nester " or " move-down " buyers , couples who are moving out of their single-family houses , making those available for move-up buyers , he said . <p> " We get quite a few singles  --  never married or divorced  --  single professionals of various ages from early 30s to 50s , " he said . " They are typically coming out of an apartment . " <p> Local customs Mac Airhart , head of Airhart Construction , said that he is building quite a few custom , contemporary houses in the $ 300,000-plus area . <p> " West of Randall Road , you have land developers who have purchased a farm and they 'll just sit there for a few years and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That 's a vigorous market . " <p> Down the road from Batavia is North Aurora , which is not  --  repeat , not  --  the north part of Aurora . It 's an individual river town that could fill up with people before it ever gets discovered . <p> Alan Houston , United Homes sales manager at Willow Lake , said that people are finding his single-family houses on their way down Randall Road . <p> " North Aurora is a quiet little village that sits on the corner of the basic growth pattern which is moving south down Randall Road and west on Interstate 88 , " said Houston . " Prices come down as you move south . " <p> Houston said that his single-family homes are selling in the $ 121,900 to $ 142,900 range to young couples and move-up buyers " who are coming primarily from the north and the east , from Aurora and Naperville and other Fox Valley villages and they are also people who do n't want to leave North Aurora . <p> " There is n't a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What land there is here is expensive . This price range ( of single-family houses ) will never be seen in this village again . " <p> Meet your neighbors Bigelow Homes has opened in North Aurora its Summer Wind development of " neo-traditional " town-house-style condominiums , units arranged facing common courtyards which encourage neighborliness , according to John Kamin , Bigelow vice president . <p> " North Aurora is beautiful . There 's a nice park by the river . You can sit there and have a picnic , " Kamin said . " All along the river , you can bicycle or walk for many , many miles . " <p> Popular with former renters , the Summer Wind units also are drawing empty-nesters , many from the immediate area , he said . <p> " Our buildings were designed for first-time buyers , " he explained . " One guy said he could n't afford anything in the same town where his parents live in a big semi-custom home , " Kamin said . <p> " But we have ranches and two plans with master bedroom suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . <p> Seniors do want amenities they have grown used to , he said , such as whirlpools , hardwood floors , oak railings , solid-core doors , porcelain sinks , bay windows , fireplaces , 9- or 10-foot ceilings , front porches , eat-in kitchens and walk-in closets . <p> Boom town While most builders like to call a development a " community , " Mill Creek actually will be a new community on 1,475 acres of former farmland in Kane County built by Kent Shodeen of Geneva . <p> " We started acquiring the land in 1982 , " he said . " We had 22 government agencies that we had to get approval from . It took us about three years . " <p> " Mill Creek is . . . all zoned for 2,000 units , of which approximately 1,800 are single family and 200 are town houses and condominiums , " he said . <p> The single-family house prices will range from about $ 170,000 to $ 450,000 and up , Shodeen said . The town houses and condominiums will come later . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call ' carriage houses , ' " Shodeen said . " If you want an ' in-law ' type unit , you can have it above the garage or free standing . We 're the only place in Illinois . . . that will have that zone . " <p> " It has a little 9-hole pitch-and-putt golf course , " Shodeen added . " There ( is ) a new grade school . We donated $ 3 million towards its construction . Forty-three percent of the site is the golf course , wetlands , forest preserve and parks . <p> " It has its own sewer and water system and sanitary district , " he added . " It has a village center which will consist of 100,000 square feet of commercial space and the same amount of office space .
