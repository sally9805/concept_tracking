Tom Witzky ( Kevin Bacon ) hardly seems the prescient sort . Yet when he is hypnotized at a party , he tumbles into nightmares  --  or is it another dimension ?  --  harboring fatal secrets . Scenarist Koepp ( Jurassic Park ) smoothly adapts a novel by Richard Matheson ( What Dreams May Come ) with vagrant similarities to The Sixth Sense . The payoff is relatively small change , but the setup is persuasive : a portrait of a blue-collar marriage in mute distress . And strap yourselves in for the spookiest , most imaginative hypnosis scene in movie memory . You are getting ... very ... scared . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
