WHENEVER HIS GIRLFRIEND , ACTRESS ROBIN RUZAN , IS FEELING blue , Saturday Night Live 's Mike Myers has just the cure . Wearing socks and Jockey shorts , he tucks his mop of reddish-brown hair beneath a motorcycle helmet , dons goofy glasses and a set of false teeth and stalks Ruzan around the minimally furnished flat ( a bed , two dressers , end tables , a green velvet couch ) that the two 28-year-olds share on Manhattan 's Upper West Side . " It does n't matter if it 's 4 in the morning , " Ruzan says . " If I look just a little bit sad , he 'll walk around with a Polaroid camera and say , " Hi , my name is Phillip . I really like you . Can I take your picture ? ' ' " By now , SNL fans may detect an eerie resemblance between Mike 's world and " Wayne 's World , " the ongoing series of sketches in which Myers plays a teenage heavy metal freak named Wayne Campbell , the " excellent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aurora , ILL. , basement . Exhorting their viewers to " Party on ! " Wayne and his nerdy best friend , Garth Algar ( Dana Carvey ) , pass judgment on everything in Wayne-speak : Beautiful " babes " ( e.g. , Madonna , " the Queen of Babe-alonia " ) elicit a " Schwing ! " - - the sound of a sword leaving its scabbard  --  while last summer 's Harrison Ford tearjerker Regarding Henry " sucked big-time . " Now Wayne 's World  --  and Myers  --  have gone big time and big screen themselves , in the movie , which critics have hailed as a sensitive exploration of the angst and joy of prolonged adolescence ... NOT ! In fact , some reviewers have , in Wayne and Garth 's oft cited euphemism for vomiting , verbally " hurled " ( or " blown chunks " ) , dismissing the flick as a lightweight farce . Shyeahh right . In its opening over President 's Day weekend , World raked in an awesome $18 million , making it the nation 's No. 1 film . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a retired data processor . Of all Mike 's characters ( including arty , German talk show host Dieter and Middle-Aged Man ) , she says , " I like Wayne least . I think he 's sort of dumb . " And , she insists , there 's no resemblance between Wayne and her son , who grew up not in the Chicago suburb of Aurora but across the Canadian border in Scarborough , a suburb of Toronto , with his brothers , Peter , now 33 , a merchandiser , and Paul , 31 , a rock guitarist . But Mom may be mistaken : Mike started doing Wayne imitations at around 12 . " That 's how I talked , " Myers says , " and then I realized that it was really a character . Then I 'd do it at parties to make girls laugh . " Mike found it even easier to make his father , Eric , a Better Business Bureau staffer , literally fall down roaring at his routines . " It was great to get Dad going , " Mike says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNL . He developed Alzheimer 's disease several years ago and died last November at age 69 . One of the things Mike cherishes most about him " was that once he grew up , he did n't lose his ability to laugh . " Mike 's showbiz career began not in comedy but in commercials : Datsun , Kit Kats , Apple Jacks , Pepsi and Kmart , among them . Bit roles in TV movies ( including 1985 's John and Yoko ) followed , and enrollment in Toronto 's York University film school beckoned . But on his final day at Stephen Leacock high school , Myers chose to matriculate to stand-up : " My last exam was at 9 A.M. My audition for Second City the Toronto comedy troupe was at 12 , and I was hired at 3 P.M. " In 1988 , while Myers was perfecting his Wayne impression , Second City veterans Dave Thomas and Martin Short brought him to the attention of SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels ( who also produced the Wayne 's World movie ) . With no other films planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leafs ( his favorite hockey team ) and , of course , Robin . " He and Ruzan are very much unto themselves , " notes Michaels . Indeed , after four years together  --  and despite no plans to marry  --  " We 're very happy , " Myers says . They 're also in no hurry to redecorate . " I 'm not old enough to have nice furniture yet , " Mike explains . In fact , he adds , " I 'm not a big fan of adulthood . I think you have to be independent . But it does n't mean you have to be boring . " No waaaay , my friend ! <p>
