It was as if we had put two magic words together to coin a new one as universal as " sports bra " or " fat burning . " CardioButt : Tone your tush while you burn lots of calories . So , we here at Shape , along with some of the best trainers and researchers in the country , created a plan to help answer the " What-can-I-do-about-my butt - fast ? " question . " Cardio work that utilizes resistance allows you to make two simultaneous investments and get one great payoff , " says Peter Francis , Ph.D. , professor of exercise and nutritional sciences and director of the Biomechanics Lab at San Diego State University . " Toning muscles will give them more form and shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your efforts . " Photograph // And Francis knows whereof he speaks . He conducted research to measure the effectiveness of resistance exercises such as squats and kickboxing known to work the gluteus maximus , the largest of the buttocks muscles . " A properly trained butt takes up less space and looks rounder and firmer , " says Francis . " And the keys to your training are heavy resistance , impact and uphill movement . " So the workouts here revolve around those three things : The stair climber feeds the need for resistance and uphill climbing , the treadmill gives you lots of uphills and speed intervals , while the elliptical trainer burns off calories with a spike of backward motion ( think resistance in reverse ) . To maximize their effectiveness , mix up the programs , alternating machines three times during the week . However , if you 're a fan of one particular machine , doing just that routine three times each week will do . After just a month or so of this timesaving program , you might have to coin another brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workout with a lowerbody stretch . Hold each of the following poses for 10-20 seconds , then repeat the series on your other side : // program 1 : stomp stair-climbing workout Total Workout Time about 30 minutes Photograph Racer-back top by Danskin ; running briefs by Liza Bruce ; shoes by Puma . // Quadriceps:Stand with feet hip-width apart , upper body erect .
