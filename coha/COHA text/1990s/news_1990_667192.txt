<p> Hunting season is n't what it used to be - not for the hunters , not for the people who manage public wildlife areas and certainly not for the folks who used to squirm at the idea from a distance . <p> These days , there 's a war in the woods . And when the smoke clears , there 's likely to be new relationships among hunters , hunted and the rest of society . Already , roles are being reversed . <p> As the season on deer opens across the USA , animal rights advocates are attracting media attention and hunter ire with protests . " We make no bones about it , " says Wayne Pacelle , national director of the Fund for Animals . " We 're out to stop the recreational killing of wildlife . " <p> Already this year in Maryland , Washington , Texas and New York , protesters have been on the offensive . They tear down tree stands , spray deer repellent and make noise to warn animals of approaching hunters . <p> Sportsmen 's groups , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism and seeking laws to protect hunters ' rights . Thirty- five states have such laws , and federal legislation is in the works . Hunters ' groups and sporting goods companies are building war chests , lobbying legislators and struggling to fashion a moral claim . <p> " Hunting harassment is basically a violation of human rights , " says Bob Delfay , executive director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation . <p> Both sides are battling for media and public attention . " About 20 percent of the American public hunts and fishes . About 20 percent are violently opposed to the idea of hunting and fishing . The future belongs to those who can control that middle 60 percent , " says Fred Milton , who manages the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's Mason Neck Wildlife Refuge in northern Virginia . <p> Mason Neck , a 1,920-acre bald eagle refuge in suburbs 45 minutes from the nation 's capital , is a typical battleground . The Fish and Wildlife Service wants a limited deer hunt to control what federal biologists see as an exploding deer population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sued to block hunting , arguing it would be cruel , dangerous to neighbors and disruptive for the bald eagle population . A federal judge , who allowed a scheduled archery hunt to get under way last week , will rule on the gun hunt in the next three weeks . <p> Protesters from Fund for Animals showed up for opening day of the archery hunt . The extra law enforcement to ensure safety probably tripled Milton 's budget for the bow hunt , he says . <p> For Milton and other veteran wildlife managers and biologists , hunting is a traditional tool . Their argument : If deer are allowed to multiply unchecked , they 'll outstrip food supplies , diminish the habitat for competing species and become prime candidates for disease and malnutrition . Many will wander off protected land to raid gardens and farms and , ultimately , be hit by automobiles and run down by dogs . <p> Soon , says Jim Gillett , Fish and Wildlife 's deputy regional director in the Northeast , " society is going to have to decide where they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hunting . Or you can have them eating your rose bushes and getting killed on the roads . " <p> The alternatives to sport hunting or letting nature take its course are expensive - moving the deer or shooting them by using government-paid marksmen . The trouble is , says Milton , " we 're getting to the point that just about anywhere that can support deer already has enough . ... Why should we pay professional hunters when we have people who have paid us with their licenses ? " <p> In fact , hunters , through license fees and excise taxes , have poured billions into wildlife management over the last half-century - a point of pride for hunting advocates . Yet critics argue that most of that money has gone to provide artificially high populations of game to hunt - deer , turkey , quail , etc. - and far too little to threatened non-game species . <p> " The old funding mechanisms just are n't working , " says Pacelle . But government managers argue that what 's good for hunters ' favorite game is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat , " says Milton , " it 's good for lots of other animals . " <p> Both sides argue science with a passion . Rep. Ron Marlenee , R-Mont. , who is sponsoring legislation to protect hunters from harassment , introduced his bill last year by saying hunting 's critics just do n't understand nature : <p> " In the Disney fantasy world of wildlife , animals are able to talk to each other about problems . If , in reality , they could talk to us , they would probably ask how they were going to avoid starvation this winter . " <p> Pacelle says , " Hunters are trying to create immunity against critical thought . " Priscilla Feral , president of Friends of Animals , says the management-tool argument is " pure propaganda . " <p> " Science is really on our side . It 's bad biology to subvert nature 's intent by killing the strong . And that 's what hunters do . They go after the big , trophy animals , the ones who would escape other predators and survive winters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow to survive . " <p> Hunting advocates might be correct , however , when they cite strong cultural differences . People who were raised around hunting in rural areas accept it as a way of life ; city and suburban dwellers , on the other hand , are disinterested or downright antagonistic . The bad news for hunters is that as we become more and more of a suburban and urban society , rural traditions are shared by fewer people . <p> Despite population increases over the last decade , total hunting license sales in the USA have dipped slightly . And even the National Shooting Sports Foundation predicts a relatively flat hunter population - 16 million to 20 million - for the foreseeable future . Which puts even more pressure on hunters , as a shrinking minority , to win tolerance from the majority with public relations . <p> It does n't help the hunters ' case when they seem better equipped to make enemies than friends . The media is quick to report incidents such as the one last weekend , where a hunter allegedly fired a weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting advocates worry about the " slob " problem , the small percentage of drunks and trigger-happy weekenders who annually nail farm animals , household pets and one another . And protesters gain points with every report in the media that hunters threatened them with firearm " accidents " when they interfered with a day in the woods . <p> What especially worries Kellert and others who advocate a middle path is that the " us-or-them " mentality could paint wildlife managers into a corner with the most rabid hunting defenders . " I think that may backfire , " says the Yale professor . " Public agencies need to be seen as objective , impartial and open . <p> " There 's a place for hunting , but as just another component . Not as some holy rite . If agencies
