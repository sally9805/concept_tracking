THE FLOOZIE IN THE JACUZZI <p> TITLE <p> The title is not one , but many . Not definitive but open . Sign of difficulty and fragmentation but also of possibility . <p> THE FLOOZIE IN THE JACUZZI/ The Problematics of Culture and Identity for an Irish Woman <p> or <p> THE WHORE IN THE SEWER/ Intersextextual Inserts and Excerpts <p> or <p> BIDET MULLIGAN/ Averse Versions of the Immersion of Women in Irish Culture <p> or <p> THE SKIVVY IN THE SINK/ " Dreams Go by Contraries " <p> or <p> ANOREXIA/ Denying Denial of Identity <p> or <p> ANNA LIVIA PLURABILITY/ The Singular Diversities and Diverse Singularities of Irish Women <p> EXPLANATORY NOTE <p> Part 1 <p> In James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake , Anna Livia Plurabelle is at once the representation of womanhood and of the city of Dublin , through which flows the river Liffey . In 1987 , Dublin City Corporation erected a large sculpture , entitled Anna Livia Plurabelle , in the center of the city . The sculpture was financed by members of the Smurfit family who control the largest indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text is a reflection on this sculpture and what it signifies , quoting freely from Finnegans Wake . <p> Part 2 <p> Although intended originally as a reflection on the problem of national identity for a woman in Ireland , this section of the text is more personal and allusive . Trying to find a way of writing about identity , trying to find a voice  --  my voice , a place from which to speak  --  my place , I realized that I am traversed and truly fructified by a constant and dynamically creative interplay of images , ideas , and experiences which spring from a " plurability " of sources , some public and published , others more private , in the domains of literature , the visual arts , history and legend , conversation  --  and more conversation . It is impossible for me to unravel all these threads which have meshed in my mind . All the writers cited are Irish and samples of their work will be found in the anthologies listed below . Here and there in the text , I use Irish ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our everyday currency in Ireland , although for the vast majority of Irish people , English is our " first " language . <p> Further Reading <p> Kelly , A.A. , ed .

Entirely deeroticized for all her nudity . All revealing nothing . Blank sightless eyes closed speechless mouth destined eternally to rigid frigidity ( frigor mortis ) . Impenetrable , not an orifice in sight . Inviolably inviolate body unassailably confined within a wall of stone ( " leda , lada , aflutter afraida , so does your girdle grow ! " ) . Relentlessly lapped and licked , caressed and purified by the unceasing flow of clearly polluted city water ( " oiled of kolooney " toilet water ) unsoftening a body hammer-hardened against seduction . Her fleshy womanness excised unfleshed in stone , anorexically attenuated denial . Impossible body , sign of the impossibility of Woman . River-woman , projection of male fantasy and desire , " daughterwife , " doubled , split , shifting , merging " woman formed mobile ? " Immobilized . <p> " Head , back and heart aches of <p> waxed up womanage " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreducible , symbolically incontrovertible . Insurmountable impermeable block of stone , moulded and cast , beaten into shape , hammered into place . <p> A L P Monumental assertion of the power of the patriarchy ; massive appropriation of Woman , sign and symbol ; pompous denial of women 's right to self-definition ; emphatic affirmation of the negation of women excluded from the generation of meaning . <p> A L P The name in ironic counterpoint to its own forever-fixed materiality ; " Woman " symbol of plurability , cruel insane mocking contradiction of the circumscribed realities of Irish women 's lives Mater-reality ; peremptory preemption of interrogation and exploration ( who am I ? what can I do ? ) . <p> A L P Parthenogenetic reversal , virgin birth , begat by Joyce , born of the incestuous transaction between the Fathers of the Capital and the genitors of Capital . Nonnegotiable gender-bender . <p> A L P Progeny of the miscegenation of Culture and City , without legitimate autonomous existence within their walls . Produced by the brokers of male power , imaginative , economic and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their values , their desires . Her function is " purely " iconic . Pure , unpolluted , uncontaminated by the actuality of actual women . Having no historical veracity/validity , she can not represent her own plurability any more than she can represent the historically and materially rooted diversity of all/Irish/Dublin women . Her very unreality ( conventional stylized allegorical figure ) functioning to erase the untidy realities of fleshy women . <p> A L P Symbolizes the plural omnipotence of somenone/something else . She functions " successfully " as symbol of civic power , not because she stands for " Woman " but precisely because " Woman " always stands for something else . " Woman " is an empty signifier , or to put it another way , can be construed to mean whatever " we " want it to mean . Transparent , transmutable , not generatrix of meaning but receiver carrier site of passage : <p> " Meanings of all kinds flow <p> through the figures of women , <p> and they often do not <p> include who she herself <p> is " <p> Marina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Woman , flowing through the city of Dublin <p> " ducking under bridges , <p> bellhopping the weirs , <p> dodging by a bit of bog , <p> rapid shooting by the bends . " <p> A L P exists not in and for herself but in and for something other than herself . Essentially vacuous , receptacle without individual identity , mute spectacle , silent cipher , the symbolic female figure is incapable of conferring meaning . Massive , monumental , grandiose , but powerless to ascribe any meanings other than those prescribed by culture , where the ( only ) point of view ( act of seeing ) is assumed to be and designated as male . Always seen , never seer . <p> The space between producer and consumer of the symbol is negotiated unproblematically by the male , because the point of view ( viewing ) is the same , homogenous . It is fraught with ambiguity and danger for a woman because not only not-same but also not acknowledged as different . Virtually impossible to traverse that space without erasing woman-self . We can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our individuality as women . Overwhelmed by its sheer bigness , we are lured into a belief in the significance of the representation . But the message carried is paradoxically ( ? ) one of our in/nonsignificance . Woman-as-image and woman-as-spectator participate in the reproduction of our own meaninglessness in culture . <p> A L P is not an image of women for women . Monument to not representation of . It uses " Woman " as a sign in a discourse from which women , imaginatively , economically , politically disempowered , are in effect and effectively excluded . <p> ( What is my name ? ) <p> In a postcolonial patriarchal culture , naming strategies have an overdetermined role , invested with an irresistible double force and double meaning . The long-denied power to name , to confer meaning , and thus ( illusion ? ) to control material reality , is all the more powerfully experienced and pleasurably exercised when finally acquired . It is a treacherous ambivalent power if the paradigm for its exercise remains unchanged . The liberation of the state implies male role-shift from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Self . Women , powerless under patriarchy , are maintained as Other of the ex-Other , colonized of the postcolonized . <p> A L P is hewn into silence , <p> " the stench of her fizzle and <p> the glib of her glab " <p> appropriated by <p> " the drunken drabbletail Dublin <p> drab " <p> Dubliners have appropriated the monument in their midst through a multiple renaming game , manifestly pleasurable , which reverberates with a plurality of significations , often contradictory ( but " dreams go by contraries " ) infinitely translating travesty . <p> Iconoclastic and irreverent , the renamings are an ironic recognition of the power of icons in a culture still significantly shaped by religion . Disparaging and reductive , each rename is a paradoxically clear statement of the desire to appropriate and of the inability to do so . The joke around which each rename revolves is an overt assertion of dominance masking actual ( but unacknowledged ) powerlessness . Substitute for the " real " power to move , remove , form , transform . Most of the renames are in-jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared meanings , incomprehensible ( ostensibly ) beyond the confines of the City . At once appeal to a shared , closed system of meaning and mechanism for the reproduction and reinforcement of sharing and closure . <p> Playing on a deliberate and overdetermined contrast between the inflatedly " High Art/High Culture " connotations of the monument , and the " ordinary " mythology of Dubliners , each joke is a consciously deflationary tactic . The " Man in the Street " incisively sanctions pomposity , cuts it down to size , renames it , so that it fits in to his world . Recuperation by the everyday . <p> And , ironically , the " foreign " words incorporated in the jokes , debasement of the " Master " language of the Colonizers , betray our island-isolated vulnerability . Persistent fear , residue of our colonial past , of permeability by outside influence , invasion by the alien force  --  cultural , technological , economic .
