There are few of them left nowadays , and they are mostly ignored . On May 9 , however , elderly veterans of the Red Army will turn out all across the former Soviet Union to celebrate their victory 50 years ago over Nazi Germany . In Moscow and Kiev , in St. Petersburg and Nizhni Novgorod , authorities are organizing rallies and parades to honor the old soldiers . And the old soldiers , rows of military medals pinned to their civilian clothes , are reminiscing about the war , the friends they lost and the savage , tragic history of the country they saved . Their stories are of heroism and struggle , of joy and sadness . <P> But the Soviet Union was saved only to eventually decay and collapse . On this anniversary of V-E day , the old soldiers ' children are assessing the past as well , but they have neither tragedy nor triumph to commemorate . Their stories are of disillusionment and despair . <P> ANNA ZOSIMOVA , 72 , works as a school administrator in St. Petersburg . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , " she says of the war , showing pictures of herself in her air-defense uniform-a dark-haired young woman with strong shoulders developed digging trenches during the 880-day siege of Leningrad . " I was young , and when you are young , you are happy . I loved to dance , and we used to have parties as often as we could . We worked 12 hours a day , seven days a week , doing hard work , shovel work . But we had time to enjoy ourselves . " <P> Zosimova recalls in particular the New Year 's Eve of 1942 in the midst of the bitterly cold first winter of the siege  --  the winter that starvation set in and an estimated 1.5 million Leningraders began to die . " We were allowed to go into the city , " she says . " I took two friends from the place where we were digging and went to my uncle 's apartment . " There was no food , but they begged a handful of flour from a friend who worked in a bakery . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the flour into small dumplings . " I got a tree and some decorations , " she says , her face creasing with laughter . " We sang songs . We ate our soup . We had a celebration . " <P> They returned to the trenchworks the next morning , New Year 's Day . " We were crossing a bridge , and the Germans started shelling , " she says . The smile fades . " One of my friends , her name was Galya , was hit . She died a little while later . " The smile is gone . Tears flow , moistening Zosimova 's deeply wrinkled old cheeks . <P> Her daughter Lena Gavrilova , 42 , is a teacher , and she believes it is important to understand the past . She only recently discovered what happened to her paternal grandfather , she says . He was denounced as a kulak in 1930 and was sent to Solovetski Island in the far north . " He died there . We do n't even know where his grave is . " She continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect it . We need to learn from it . But our politicians have forgotten that . I do n't know for sure what 's going on in Chechnya , the politics of it . When I see boys whom I taught coming back with limbs missing , crippled by war , I can not understand the decisions that our politicians are making . "
