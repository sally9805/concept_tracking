Jason is excited as he parks the demonstrator LeBaron in front of his house . He parks on the street so his neighbors can see it , and maybe decide to buy one . That 's not likely , but it 's possible , and a car salesman plays the odds . If you greet enough customers , put the cars in front of enough people , someone will buy one . As they have done today . A brand new Imperial , cash , and Jason already has the commission check in his breast pocket . <p> He fingers the crisp paper as he walks up the driveway to the door . Yes , still there . And just before Christmas . Ginny will be pleased . He tries the doorknob before he goes for his house keys , but it is locked . Not a good sign . If Ginny were home , she would have left it open for him , maybe even met him at the door . Unless she got caught up in something and forgot the time . That 's happened before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fishes in his pocket for the keys , unlocks the door , and as he steps into the darkened house he says loudly , hopefully , " Honey , I 'm home ! " <p> The silent house returns not even an echo . Jason switches on the kitchen light and takes a cautious sniff . NO aroma of freshly baked bread , no meaty heaviness of a roast or even a hamburger casserole . The wave function has collapsed , the universe has chosen . Ginny is not home today . <p> She might have been . That 's the most frustrating aspect of the whole thing . Until Jason checked to see , she might have been right here in this kitchen , wanting him as eagerly as he wanted her , but the very act of arriving was enough to set the universal dice in motion and tonight they came up snake-eyes . <p> He turns around and steps outside again , closing the door behind him . A virtual couple pops into being on the sidewalk beside his car , a teenage boy and girl walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs . They take three steps before vanishing , their very existence swallowed in the quantum foam . <p> Jason shivers and opens the door again , but Ginny is still gone . He knew she would be ; the universe ca n't be fooled that easily . <p> He sets the commission check on the kitchen table and plods through the house , shedding briefcase , shoes , tie , and the rest of his clothing along the way into the bedroom , where he collapses backward on the bed and stares at the ceiling . The lunar landscape of its textured surface is dimly lit from the evening light filtering through the window overlooking the back yard . Jason tells himself that the ceiling is a good metaphor for his life , that the even pattern of bumps up there results from the same randomness that haunts his marriage . The carpenter who made the ceiling had no idea where each speck of grout would go ; he just sprayed them upward in a great shower of mud , and the overall , aggregate pattern of those thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Even though it was theoretically possible , the carpenter probably did n't worry about them all landing in the same place , or inexplicably avoiding an area shaped like , say , the face of the Madonna . <p> It 's a lousy metaphor and Jason knows it . Yes , overall he and Ginny have a happy marriage , but he wants her now . Now , this instant , warm and cuddly with her auburn hair dancing in loopy curls around her ears , her smile wide and inviting . . . <p> Jason gets up abruptly , pads into the bathroom , and takes a shower . He scrubs off the day 's sweat first , then closes his eyes and satisfies his other need as best he can . It is n't enough . He opens his eyes , looking at the bright white tiles with the beads of water forming and falling from them . Thousands of drops , spraying randomly off his chest , yet forming an even distribution along the wall . A Gaussian distribution , named after Karl F. Gauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other doyen of particle behavior , was even a boy . Jason knows these things . He has read up on the subject . Yet as so many physicists have learned , knowing how a phenomenon works does n't mean he can control it . <p> Jason still needs some kind of release . He reaches forward and turns the faucet slowly to cold , gritting his teeth until the primal whoop bursts from his lungs . This time the whole house echoes . <p> The next evening she is home . Jason knows that last night has nothing to do with tonight , that random events by definition can not influence one another . A tossed coin can come up tails a dozen times in a row and still have a fifty-fifty chance on the next throw . <p> But tonight it 's heads . For Jason . Trouble is , evidently Ginny is having a tails sort of day , because the moment he opens the door he feels himself fading away . He gets a glimpse of her talking on the phone , but when she turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles go when they annihilate . <p> When awareness returns , he is sitting on a stool at the end of a polished mahogany bar . A tall glass in front of him holds ice and a straw , and smells of gin . Jason groans . Of all the places he could go , why does he keep coming here ? Only a cheap motel would be worse . But either way , whether he reeked of gin or perfume , if he were to go home now his marriage would be mined . Jason knows this with instinctive certainty . Ginny may suspect where he goes , but she must never know . <p> He orders coffee from the gray-haired bartender , slurps down two cups while watching the other patrons in the mirror . How many of them came here voluntarily ? he wonders . How many are victims of chance ? <p> In one of those random moments when all the voices are silent but one , he hears : " Okay , a Frenchman , a Mexican , and a Texan are in a balloon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punch line . <p> When he gets home , Ginny is gone . This time it works in Jason 's favor ; there will be no argument tonight , no attempt to explain the inexplicable . No warm wife to snuggle with either , though . On the whole , Jason does n't like the trade . <p> He looks in the bedroom closet , but her suitcase is still there . Sometimes it and some of her clothing is gone and he knows she is at her mother 's , but tonight she could be anywhere . She could even be right here at home , simply phase-shifted so they can not interact . <p> He goes to bed and holds her pillow , imagining that it is her . <p> The next day he considers calling her from work to find out what he 'll be facing when he goes home , but he has tried that before and it does n't work . Early knowledge gives him no more satisfaction than none , and finding her home during the day does n't guarantee anything anyway ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He imagines one of his co-workers overhearing him on the phone , maybe even saying something like , " Checking up on the little woman , eh ? " but he knows that will never happen . Such a statement might be misconstrued , and even if the meaning could somehow be made unambiguous , whether or not their wives are home to greet them at night is not something men talk about . Not these men , at least . Yet Jason wonders if they all straggle with the same uncertainty . Some of them even have kids ; Jason shudders to think of what it must be like to go to bed without knowing that your child is safe in his room . Always wondering , as Jason wonders on the lonely nights , whether this time your loved ones are lost for good . Or whether you are lost to your family . <p> He and Ginny have decided to wait until they solve their problem before they have kids of their own . It 's one of the few things about which they both agree perfectly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You can never know both the position and the disposition of your spouse to infinite accuracy . <p> That night he takes a pickup from the lot and brings home a Christmas tree . He backs into the driveway so he unload it easily , and as he gets out of the pickup he sees Ginny smiling at him through the kitchen window . A great weight slides away from him , and as he takes the few steps to the door he squares his shoulders , shakes his head so his hair will fall into that slightly mussed state she likes so much , and opens the door . " I 'm ho-ome , " he calls playfully , and she smiles , comes to him , kisses him with lips warm and soft and tasting of cookie dough : She is baking snickerdoodles , Jason 's favorite . <p> " Tell me how they are , " she says , handing him one still hot out of the oven . <p> He blows on it to cool it , takes a bite , feels it melt into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mmmm , " he says , then kissing her again with crumbs still on his lips , " Mmmmmm . " <p> In the bedroom she helps him change out of his suit , running her hands over his body and kneading the sore muscles in his back just as he 'd wished she would for the last two nights . He rubs her back as well , and is about to unbutton her shirt when the oven timer goes off . Laughing , she twists away , and he feels a momentary pang of regret , but then he laughs and dresses in his casual clothes . There will be time enough for that later . <p> They decorate the tree , he hanging the gold balls and she the silver . They 're careful not to let the antiparticles touch . Ginny suggests using just one kind , for safety , but Jason shakes his head and says , " If we did that , the energy balance would be off . " <p> When the tree is decorated , heavy with cosmic strings and shimmering gamma rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has bought many small things , not wanting to repeat the fiasco of two years ago when he bought Ginny a single diamond necklace . Of course when she opened the box , it was empty . Fifty-fifty chance . This year she 'll get a few empty boxes , but half of them will be full . <p> He has even bought multiple presents for the cat , though he has n't seen it for days . <p> After dinner they cuddle on the sofa . They whisper , they tickle , they laugh . Jason kisses her , softly at first , then more deeply . In the rush of excitement that follows , her shirt makes a quantum shift to the floors then in a quick chain reaction the rest of their clothing follows . Inexorable pressure brings them together , the heat between them building and building until they undergo fusion . <p> Jason wishes they could remain in this state forever , but the isotope is unstable , as it always is . Fission inevitably follows . They move to the bed when bare skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie side by side under the covers , moonlight softening the shadows , he realizes this is the time he loves the most . The quiet time at the end of a perfect day . Hesitantly , he asks , " Do you  --  do you ever wish it could always be like this ? <p> She nods , an almost imperceptible tilt of her head . " Of course I do . But it ca n't be . " <p> " Why not ? he asks . <p> " Because it is n't . The universe does n't work that way . " She turns on her side , away from him . <p> He knows he is treading on thin ice now , but he ca n't leave it alone . " I just wish  --  " he begins , but she says , " Jason , I ca n't always be your fantasy lover . " <p> The moment has become as fragile as a uranium atom . Jason pauses , his mind seething with the possibilities . Virtual particles come into being , annihilate , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nucleus , directly into the heart of the matter ? Increase its weight with questions until it splits apart , and in splitting yields its secrets ? Or should he shield it , preserve its glittering presence for as long as possible ? Jason feels the entire universe quiver with anticipation as he considers the ramifications . Weighs the options . Decides . <p> " Oh , but you are , " he says , kissing her earlobe and nestling up against her like one spoon behind another . He holds her , and as she drifts off to sleep he thinks , You are my fantasy lover . And all the craziness , all the uncertainty , is worth it for these moments when it 's fantastic . <p> <p> By Jerry Oltion <p> On the surface , Jerry Oltion 's life is deceptively simple .
