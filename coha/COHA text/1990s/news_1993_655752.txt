<p> NO one 's sure how many people live in Manlius , Ill . <p> The sign outside town says 450 . Alan Dale thinks its 440 . Bill Doty , who owns the Manlius Oil Company , says it 's closer to 400 . The point is that this small farm town has had roughly 400 people for about as long as anybody can remember . Somehow , it has survived . <p> Mr. Dale is another survivor . I met him seven years ago at the peak of the farm crisis . Despite his farm 's financial situation , he was unusually upbeat then . Now , with times slightly easier , I notice the same ready smile under his bushy moustache . <p> Call it spirit , attitude , or just plain grit , you find a lot of it out here . Rural America endures despite the challenges of nature and the farm economy . <p> To drive through Manlius is to move back in time . On the right is the local grain elevator . On the left , the local bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive across town . " You know you 're in small-town America when there are no stoplights , " Dale says . " We 've got lots of stop signs . Just no stoplights . " Annual event with pork sandwiches and no speeches <p> This is a special Saturday in Manlius . The local grain elevator , Michlig AgriCenter , is holding its annual customer appreciation day . Locals have gathered at the sportsman 's club to a sit-down dinner of pork sandwiches , coleslaw , potato salad , and baked beans . At the entrance , salesmen of seed , fertilizer , and other goods stand in line to greet old customers and prospect for new ones . There are no speeches . The place is packed . <p> At Dale 's invitation , local hog farmer Don Steele sits down opposite me . The pork comes from nearby Wyanet , he says . " We have n't used our own hogs now for eight to nine years . " Using certified meat avoids any liability problems . <p> His son , Randy , did the cooking for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " Around this area here you can name one right after the other who has to work off the farm , " Mr. Steele says . <p> Ken Brummel , a new farmer , is one of them . He estimates that a fifth of his income comes from his second job . He tows a portable fanning mill to a farm and cleans everything from oats to prairie grass seed . Prairie grass is becoming a popular cover crop with county conservation offices . His father built the mill from old parts . <p> Dale has had to take a nonfarm job too . <p> After holding several positions with the Illinois Farm Bureau , he has been reelected executive vice president for one year . The job keeps him on the road , making presentations , for half of the year . A third of the Dales ' income comes from the part-time work of his wife , Chris , his own Farm Bureau work , and other off-farm income . In the midst of all that , Dale still manages to farm 1,200 acres , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly profitable year . Yields were excellent , but an unusually cool summer meant that the crops did n't fully mature . Farmers had to make a difficult choice : harvest early and spend money to dry the crop manually or wait and hope for a dry fall to do the trick naturally . Fall was wet . Driving through the countryside , Dale points out fields where last year 's corn has still not been harvested . The intertwining of man and the land <p> Visitors to the rural Midwest often joke about its monotony : flat or slightly rolling land overlaid with field after field of corn , punctuated by an old barn . <p> Big Sur it is n't . But a farmer sees his roots here . As Dale drives , he points out his family history . Here , a field owned by an uncle . There , a farmhouse once occupied by parents . The intertwining of man and land out here would amaze a city person . <p> Dale 's great grandparents settled here 110 years ago . Their land was divided and subdivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the family name came up for sale . Dale was determined to get it but could afford only $ 1,400 an acre . The early morning bidding went fast , up to $ 1,350 . In the afternoon , a new bidder pushed the price to $ 1,375 and Dale countered with $ 1,400 . Miraculously , no one topped the offer . Dale figured the land was worth at least $ 1,725 an acre . <p> " It was the high point of the day , " he recalls . Within an hour , his grandmother passed on . " That was the low point of the day . " Dale still is moved by the coincidence . He tries to go on , but his voice cracks and he wipes his eyes . <p> Earlier that year , in February , Dale reached his financial low point . The farm crisis was in full swing . He had finished his term in several Farm Bureau positions . " I could n't give the family the things I wanted , " he remembers . " And it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked very seriously if there was something else we should be doing . " <p> Chris recalls that time too . " I was looking for things for him to do . " January and February are always tough times for grain farmers , she says . " They are never quite with you . They are always off somewhere else ... If you talk to any honest farm wife , you will get the same answer . We do n't want January and February to come . " <p> The gloom passed for Dale . " I just decided that I was n't ready to give up yet , " he says . The next year turned out to be a good crop year . Land prices , which had fallen dramatically , began to stabilize . That gave farmers and their bankers some breathing room , since farmers often borrow against their land to put in their spring crop . Farm economics : why Dale works land that was once seven farms <p> Many people would be surprised at the sums of money that pass through a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Midwest . Here in Bureau County , for example , Dale figures that in an average year an acre of corn should yield at least 135 bushels . If he can get a price of $ 2.50 a bushel , that 's $ 337.50 an acre . Spread over , say , 600 acres , that amounts to $ 202,500 . The problem is that most of the income in the fall has already been spent in the spring , what with fertilizer , fuel , pesticides , taxes , interest , depreciation on the machinery , and insurance . Factor in the lost opportunity of putting his money somewhere else and Dale figures he makes about $ 75 on an acre of land he owns . The calculations are different on land he rents . <p> That 's pretty good for an average year . But farming has been anything but average during the past decade . The drought of 1988 did in many farmers here . <p> " I never recovered from that one , " says Steve Cunningham , who shared machinery with Dale . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be him or me " who would be forced to leave farming . " I hoped it would be him . " <p> But it was Cunningham who finally gave up farming . Last year he moved to Sterling , Ill. , with his wife , who already worked there full-time as a registered nurse . In February , he found a full-time position with a petroleum supplier . He has no regrets about leaving , he says . " By the time I had made the decision to leave , that was not an issue . " Dale took over Cunningham 's leases and now farms that land too . <p> This consolidation is an ongoing trend in rural America . Dale has nine landlords . The acres he now farms represented seven separate farm operations in the mid-1970s . Critics are wrong when they say that corporations are taking over Midwestern grain farming ( though livestock farming seems headed in that direction ) . The reality is that margins are so thin that farmers must till more and more land to make the same amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations . <p> " I 'm kind of depressed with the economy , " says Joe Michlig , who owns the Manlius elevator . From 1963 to 1993 , the average price of corn has doubled to $ 2.24 a bushel . But he remembers buying cars in 1963 that were a fraction of today 's cost . Community bolstered by loyalty but schools are shrinking <p> With all these economic forces in place , it 's a wonder that tiny Manlius has held up so well . One reason is that the town has retained its industrial base . For years , Kraft had a food-processing plant here . When the corporation consolidated , Manlius lost the plant . But Kory Farm Equipment moved in and began making farm wagons . <p> Manlius Oil has also prospered . Mr. Doty sells tires and pumps gas . When the number of fuel oil customers started declining eight years ago , Doty diversified into propane . <p> " I gambled , " he says . " Everything 's a gamble . " This one worked . Business increased steadily , especially last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wet crops . <p> Doty gives a different reason for the town 's survival . <p> " It 's a loyal community , " he says . Chris Dale , for example , only buys her gas here or at one other place . She says she does n't know how to operate a self-serve pump . At night when the shop is closed , Doty leaves out buckets of cleaner so townsfolk can wash bugs and grime off their windshields . <p> Manlius 's future is not assured . The town lost one of its grain elevators in the 1980s . The school population is down . When Dale graduated from the local high school , there were 24 in his graduating class . When his daughter Sherri graduated last year there were only 14 . <p> The shrinkage has affected local sports . Before he graduated , Alan 's son Matt played on a football team that had merged with nearby Tampico , Ill . Since then the boys basketball team has also merged with Tampico . Sherri played on an independent girls basketball team last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate is staring other nearby schools in the face . Dale 's niece in Wyanet had only five players on her basketball team . In one game , three teammates fouled out , leaving her and one teammate to defend against the opposing five-girl team . <p> These signs suggest that the Manlius school will eventually have to merge with another district , Chris says . Two weeks earlier , officials from the larger Walnut , Ill. , schools came to Manlius to propose a merger of high-school academic programs . But many townspeople , including Chris , disapprove of that idea for the moment . <p> " I guess I 'm prejudiced , " she says , " but I always thought those kids growing up on the farm grew up with such a better understanding of what life is . They know what work is and they 're not afraid of it . " <p> Matt , who has ridden with us all afternoon , has n't said much . But at one point , while his parents tromp about a piece of family-owned land , he stays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think I ever realized how tough it was for dad , " he says . Matt works for an asphalt company . He is married with two kids . <p> " My first love is farming , " he says . " Her his wife 's first love is two vacations a year and ... uh ... reassurance . And I ca n't give that to her with full-time farming . And I 'm a little scared " at the prospect .
