February 1987 : Geoff Bruce looks down from the chairlift at Boyne , Michigan , and beholds the most incredible set of tracks he has ever seen . Tight , short-radius turns , with no trace of skidding . Geoff , who spent eight years on the U.S. Ski Team during the 1970s , was amazed by the tracks . He 'd spent most of his like trying to ski " fast , clean , and tight . " The tracks , however , were not made by a skier . " On my second run , " Geoff says today , " I realized it was a guy on a snowboard . I became envious of what a snowboard could do-it was something that I had spent a whole lifetime trying to do . " February 1995 : A test demo of next year 's skis at Buttermilk , Colorado . Geoff has been seeking the perfect carve over the years , trying all types of skis , including some super-sidecuts , but nothing has done the trick . Today the Elan SCX prototypes arrive , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them and I got stoked . " He 's in the lift line at 8:50 A.M. , ten minutes before the lift opens , itching for a first run . A bunch of snowboarders are there , too , and they become curious about these odd-looking skis . Geoff and the riders agree to do a track comparison . " I measure tracks with my fist , " says Geoff . " My slide path was four to five fists wide , theirs were one first . " Disappointment . On the lift , one of the snowboarders explains , " We riders have a big advantage  --  we can get a far greater edge angle . " Geoff pulls a boot wrench out of his pocket at the top and sets his boots for maximum cant . On the second run , the tracks look identical . Elation . By 11 A.M. , Geoff has discarded his ski poles . He has n't used them since . Of course , carving pure turns is n't the only use for super-sidecut skis , or even the only use for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These skis make it easier for most skiers to put more carving and less skidding into their turns , even if they do n't abandon their poles , adopt a radical technique , or share Geoff 's obsession for the pure carve . They simply make it very easy to have fun . But for skiers like Geoff , carving is not just the best thing about skiing , it 's the only thing . " My whole focus has been to make that turn , " he says . His success on the SCX has instilled in him the same sort of devotion boarders show for riding . " On the SCX , I often forget to have lunch . Food is n't part of the equation , " he says , sounding like a true fanatic . This from a man who has skied in the Olympics and on the World Cup . What 's it like to make a pure carved turn ? " It 's like in-line skating , or ice-skating . It 's like you 're a hockey defenseman going behind the net at full speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean . " It 's like you 're water-skiing : You almost feel like you 're being pulled through the turn by a ski boat . You set up for turns with your feet close together , then commit to the center of the turn  --  to the point where you feel like you 're going to bite it . But centrifugal force and gravity pull you through  --  that 's when you begin looking for the MasterCraft . " Geoff has been developing his technique as he goes along , and he 's still learning . " When you dump your poles , a certain hand discipline is no longer necessary  --  and a certain degree of angulation is forsaken . The more hip angulation , the greater the chance of booting out  --  your boot hits the snow and knocks you off the edge . I use moderate angulation with increased " bicycling " to compensate . " Earlier this year Geoff started racing on the SCX , and that is likely to refine his ideas further . Despite his desire for carving , Geoff was n't ever tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pure carve on skis . Besides , he says , " The idea of having my feet fixed in a certain position just is n't attractive to me . " Not that he was n't open to new ideas . Ironically , Geoff , a bona fide expert skier , achieved his lifelong goal on a ski originally conceived as a tool to help intermediates break out of the skidturn rut . His unorthodox use of the unorthodox SCX is not really surprising ; experimentation is in the mountain air . Tele skiers are mounting three-pin bindings and free-heel cable bindings on super-sidecuts , for playing on the groomed , and putting them on wide powder skis , for exploring new terrain in powder-filled woods . Other skiers are using superlight Alpine touring bindings and their Alpine touring boots , so they can lock their heels down . Manufacturers are also beginning to toy with ski shapes and lengths . Man more variations on the super-sidecut theme will emerge next year ( see Gear Talk , page 28 ) . Ski design has no been freed from the narrow thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years . The SCX and the other super-sidecuts have changed the rules of the manufacturing game . After years of focusing on racing as the ultimate expression of success , the goal now is to make skiing fun for all skiers . It 's hard to predict just how this shift will shape skis in the future , but ski shapes will indeed change . Whatever new designs are introduced , skiers are sure to find new and unexpected ways to use them . Super-sidecuts are only a few years old , and already they are changing the way we ski . There 's no telling where all the current and future innovations will lead , but it looks like we 'll have fun getting there . Just look at what Geoff is up to . <p>
