These are the longest days . Time moves in slow motion . An entire world waits with shallow breath , and the news never ends . Snippets of hope are dashed almost as quickly as they appear , only to be succeeded by fresh rumors of a peaceful exit . In a sense , it is all familiar . End games fascinate . In school , where we studied them attentively , the chapters were invariably titled " The Drift Toward War . " The conclusions , too , were nearly uniform : If only there had been more time ; if only the antagonists had understood one another better ; if only the crisis had been nipped in the bud before it escalated . <P> However historians eventually judge the rush of events in the Persian Gulf , few will fairly conclude that what occurred was a failure to communicate . For months , George Bush has agonized that Saddam Hussein has not got the message . Tariq Aziz buried that illusion last week in Geneva . That was no dialogue of the deaf , as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horror that awaits Iraq if peace dies . Aziz undoubtedly knew the truth of the Secretary of State 's assertions . But Aziz knows his boss too , and probably knows as well that no matter how unambiguously a person sees the light , in the end he can not be saved from himself . <P> If clarity has been assured , only tragedy remains . Both sides , it seems , are ready for war because neither is willing to suffer a supposedly worse fate  --  the humiliation that capitulation , or its perception , implies . <P> " Do n't go to war in response to emotions of anger and resentment , " said Dwight Eisenhower , who regularly counseled the courage of patience . But if war begins , anger and resentment is what it will have come down to . " It is about power and commitment , " says Fouad Ajami , director of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University . " On both sides , the greatest fear is being seen to be a wimp . " The best analogy is perhaps literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's colonial functionary kills a rogue elephant because those watching him expect it . " It is the condition of ( ( the white man 's ) ) rule , " Orwell has his character say , " that he shall spend his life trying to impress the ' natives , ' and so in every crisis he has got to do what the ' natives ' expect of him . . . To come all that way , rifle in hand , and then to trail feebly away , having done nothing  --  no , that was impossible . The crowd would laugh at me . " George Bush " has drawn his rifle , " says Ajami . " He can not back down . " <P> And neither , it appears , can Saddam Hussein . The fig leaves Saddam could seize to justify withdrawing from Kuwait have been available from the beginning . The Kuwaitis themselves have consistently said they are willing to negotiate over Iraq 's grievances . Even the international peace conference that Saddam posits as a price for leaving Kuwait is possible  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. desire to avoid linkage is basically a semantic exercise , and the offers of explicit linkage carried by middlemen like the French and the Algerians could at any time be used by Saddam to save face . Were he to decide to leave Kuwait , the list of creative ways for the Iraqi leader to portray himself heroically is virtually limitless  --  and some in Washington indicate that an attack may not occur for several weeks , in the hope that Saddam will finally come to his senses .
