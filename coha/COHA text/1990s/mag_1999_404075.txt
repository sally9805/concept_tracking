International dealers - have flocked back to post-Soviet Azerbaijan to cash in on its greats , store of Caspian Sea oil . The big question is when the Azeri people , including one million war refugees , will benefit . Photograph Photograph // THE TEMPLE OF CAPITAL The central Asian republic of Azerbaijan-with its venerable Mediterranean-style capital , Baku-has always been a crossroads , a place to pass through . At the margin of Europe and Asia , wedged between Russia and the Caucasus Mountains to the north and Iran to the south , Azerbaijan served historically as a key point on the trade route between the Caspian and Black Seas . A tramping ground for a murderer 's row of conquerors ( Cyrus the Great , Alexander the Great , Pompey , Genghis Khan , Tamerlane , and Peter and Catherine the Great are just a few who have sacked this place ) , and for seventy-one years a Soviet socialist republic , Azerbaijan is now hosting a reprise of what Rudyard Kipling once referred to as The Great Game : the nineteenth-century scramble by England , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a new breed of foreign presence-bearing the standards of Exxon , Chevron , Pennzoil , et al.has arrived in Baku , seeking to conquer geology . The 5.5-million-year-old sand and clay sediments of the Middle Pliocene Productive Series of the Caspian Basin seabed have been determined to contain the earth 's largest relatively accessible petroleum cache . In our hydrocarbon-addicted , forever consuming world , which many geologists believe has already used up more than half its oil reserves , the game-at least for now-is here . Upward of $40 billion has been slated by various corporations for mining the underwater oil reserves of the Caspian Sea , but this figure is likely to go up , since littoral Caspian nations , such as Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , and Turkmenistan are still very much in the " early oil " stage . Much remains to be settled . Arguments over whether the Caspian , the world 's largest inland body of water , should be called a sea or a lake ( an issue of huge legal and economic import for the littoral states , which will divvy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another bone of contention is pipeline politics-that is , how and by which route the prospective oil will be brought to gas guzzlers everywhere , once it is slurped up from beneath the Caspian 's floor . Maps of the Caucasus region show numerous criss-crossing lines denoting various pipeline paths : working , nonworking , proposed , and discarded ( see " Pipeline Politics , " page 59 ) . Photograph A dugout in a refugee camp , left , is home to an elderly man . He has planted a tree there , a place he calls " this hell . " // The touchiest question of all is exactly how much oil lies under the choppy Caspian waters . Churlish petrol geologists put the hydrocarbon potential at a mere 75 billion barrels of crude ( 1 barrel = 42 U.S. gallons ; 7.4 barrels = 1 ton ) , similar to the North Sea reserves . The government of Azerbaijan and international business sources , in a decidedly more glasshalf-full mode , are fond of quoting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott , who gushes about there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a junior-league Kuwait . Until the well " drill strings " pierce the Caspian 's sedimentary layers , no one will know for sure how " big " the sea will be ; several sites on the Absheron ridge have proved disappointing or have yielded only gas , which is much more difficult to extract and more expensive to bring to market than oil . But suffice it to say that no impoverished , war-torn ex-Soviet republic ever attracted foreign investment by underestimnatin. its oil reserves . Oil-and its fire-have been a defining force in Azerbaijan for thousands of years . It was near here , in the Caucasus Mountains ( said the ancient Greeks ) that the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind . The connection between fire and oil was made by the followers of the prophet Zoroaster , who was born in northern Iran ( called South Azerbaijan by Azeri nationalists ) nearly three thousand years ago . Postulating a dualistic universe overseen by opposing godheads of Light ( Ahura Mazda ) and Darkness ( Ahriman ) , Zoroastrians saw fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fire temples , Zoroastrian priests , called magi , kept a flame permanently burning . Then word came , from a place to the north ( the Absheron Peninsula , site of Baku ) , of a magical black liquid that bubbled from the ground and burst into flame when hit by lightning . Once ignited , its fires ( which were fed by surface-level oil and gas hydrocarbon deposits ) would burn for years . Indeed , it seemed they would burn forever , thereby becoming what the magi imagined to be an eternal flame . For Zoroastrians , this made Azerbaijan-the home of the atesh adran , the oilfed " fire of fires " -a holy place . Photograph Above : Mud volcanoes are scattered across the Azerbaijani landscape , giving clues to the whereabouts of oil Volcanoes also stud the Caspian seabed and are a potential hazard to oil pipelines. // Other early travelers to take note of Baku 's oil were of a more utilitarian mind . In the thirteenth century , Marco Polo , passing this way en route to the Far East , noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neft , as it was called locally , was being extracted from the ground in the Absheron area . " One could load up to a hundred poods a Russian measure equaling thirty-six pounds of this neft at a time , " the explorer reported . " It 's inedible , but it can be burned or smeared on camels suffering from scabies and sores . People come here from afar for this oil , and it is burned all over the country " By 1479 , when Venetian ambassador Iosafat Barbaro passed through , oil use had grown more sophisticated . Barbaro was amazed to find " a mountain which pours out this very stinking black oil which is used in lamps at night . " Further progress was noted by the German physician Engelbert Kaempfer in 1683 . By that time , there were hand-dug wells from which oil was extracted in sheepskin buckets raised and lowered by horse-drawn winches . The genesis of the modern Baku oil industry reads like a who 's who of late-nineteenth-century international plutocracy . In 1872 imperial Russia opened the Baku fields to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alfred , the dynamite tycoon for whom the Peace Prize would be named , arrived in Baku . Nominally charged with finding lumber to be used for rifle butts in his brother 's Siberian munitions factory , Robert purchased some oil wells instead . By 1880 , the Nobel brothers owned the largest oil company in Russia . They built the world 's first pipelines , first modern refinery , and first oil tanker , the Zoroaster . In 1883 , when the Rothschilds financed the Baku-to-Batumi rail line , allowing Azerbaijani petrol to reach the Black Sea and the rest of Europe , John D. Rockefeller 's kerosene monopoly in the world market was shattered . At the turn of the century in Baku , more than two hundred refineries were belching enough smoke to obscure the noonday sun over " Black Town , " an industrial section of the capital . By then , Azerbaijan was exporting nearly 60 percent of the earth 's available petroleum . Much of the profit was grabbed by foreign hands , but , as befitted a capital of world industry , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly Hillbillies , " peasant farmers , after generations of unhappily picking tar from sheep 's wool , found that the bubbling crude on their land was worth a fortune . Cargo loaders and scrap leather dealers became millionaires . Avowed Muslims , the oil barons nevertheless looked to Europe , forging an eccentric syncretism between East and West . Renowned architects were summoned from Germany and Poland . Almost overnight , fanciful " oil palaces " arose along the low-slung Baku skyline . An impossibly ornate opera house , the first in the Islamic world , appeared on the Caspian shore . In 1920 the oil baron Murtuza Mukhtarov shot dead two soldiers who had ridden their horses up the grand stairway of his block-long French Gothic home ( called the Palace of Good Fortune ) ; he then pressed the pearl-handled pistol to his own temple . Baku 's oil boom had come to an end . With nationalization , the Bolsheviks dispersed Azeri oil throughout the fledgling U.S.S.R.-gratis .

With the subsequent development of oil fields in Texas and the Middle East , Azerbaijan appeared to be largely relegated to the dustbin of hydrocarhan hictory Not everyone had forgotten the former oil capital , however , as documented in a grainy wartime home movie shot at a birthday party for Adolf Hitler . The Fuhrer 's cake is adorned by a map of the Caspian Sea , with the letters B-A-K-U spelled out in chocolate cream . Hitler eats a piece and then avidly licks his fingers . " Unless we get Baku oil , the war is lost , " he would declare . These words proved prophetic , as the Nazi leader , obsessed with Germany 's failure to gain control of Azerbaijani oil during World War I , disregarded his generals ' advice to attack Moscow immediately and chose instead to drive toward Baku , a futile campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign executives doing business together at the state oil company offices in Baku , right , is a common sight , as is the face of President Heydar Aliyev on roadside billboards , left . // " Shortage of petrol ! " wailed Field Marshal Rommel after running out of gas while also trying to reach the Caucasus oil fields . " It 's enough to make one weep ! " Today Baku , where the kabobs are tasty and the weather excellent , is a model of post-Soviet cosmopolitanism . While nominally Shi'ite Muslim , Azerbaijanwhich has always culturally aligned itself with Sunni Muslim Turkey-appears notably immune to the clerical zeal practiced by Iran , its neighbor to the south . There are few places in which Soviet-style atheism has been so successful . For the traveler , it is disorienting to walk around a predominantly Muslim country for days yet never hear a call to prayer . With the dismantling of the Communist-era iconography , almost every statue in Baku depicts a writer , artist , or musician . Verses of the grand twelfth-century national poet Nizami are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , have been made more seedily romantic by seven decades of comprehensive Soviet proletarian neglect . Foreign oilmen are suckers for the ambience . Tap the surface of an " oily " ( as they call themselves ) - the smart ones anyway-and a closet romantic is bound to emerge . The best of them-nothing more or less than good old boys in corporate veneer-fancy themselves wildcatters at heart , men of the world , acutely aware of their Master of the Universe positioning in relation to one of the planet 's dominant natural resources . After all , where would the Beach Boys , Chuck Berry 's long freeway , or a million truck-stop short-order cooks be without them ? In Baku , older oilies can be seen hanging out at the seaside Cinema Club with the youngish workers from nongovernmental organizations , listening to local jazz at the stylish Mugam club in the Old City or trawling seamy downtown bars like the Sherwood and the Coral , although Americans have been known to favor the Ragin ' Cajun or the Wild West , where country line-dancing is available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop sits across the road from the Wild West , except that the drivers are Iranian and the windshields sport decals of Ayatollah Khomeini . While nothing near the Casablanca-style nest of spies and gangsters it is sometimes made out to be-a James Bond movie with a plot involving pipeline sabotage is reputedly in the works-Baku is nevertheless thick with industrial intrigue . Much of the gossip centers on the " royal family " of Heydar Aliyev , the steely seventy-five-year-old former senior KGB official who ruled Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982 and now does so again as a duly elected semidemocrat . Azeri and expatriate alike were surprised recently when Aliyev converted Baku 's gambling casinos to conference rooms . Some say , puckishly , that the conversion may have had something to do with the fabled losses of Aliyev 's son Ilham , who , despite his gift position as vice president of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic ( SOCAR ) , is regarded as something less than the next stepping-stone in the dynasty .

Here the petrolspeak of " outsourcing , " " rightsizing , " and " debottlenecking " is carried on in whispers . In a country of clatter and bustle , the Hyatt 's restaurant is an oasis of hushed tranquillity . Spacious , with huge sun-streaming windows and thirty-foot ceilings , the restaurant feels important beyond its tastefully displayed art or outrageous prices ; it 's like a library or a church . Across town , by the sea , one can sit in a similarly sun-washed and high-ceilinged , if decidedly more threadbare , room inside a massive government building . In that room , inside a building constructed by forced German labor after World War II , Stalin ate under a huge chandelier . During his days as a revolutionary in Baku organizing oil workers , the murderous Soviet leader is said to have spoken of his nostalgic feelings for Azerbaijan while drinking tea in the dining room , which may or may not account for the painstakingly painted hammer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in Baku ) adorning the otherwise shabby walls . More than fifty years later , a sense of power remainsand a somber respect for that power . A similar , updated sense of reverence is felt at the Hyatt . It is a realm apart , a solemn place of linen tablecloths and privilege , a Temple of Capital . Eating a $17 continental breakfast in the quietude of the Hyatt , a visitor might find himself seated a few tables from Zbigniew Brzezinski , Jimmy Carter 's former national security advisor and now a special consultant for BP Amoco in central Asia . Get up to speak to him and there is a mirror reaction from across the room : a bodyguard doing his job . Casual in his yellow cardigan , sitting alone eating a bowl of muesli , Zbig is friendly , happy to sign an autograph . As for the chance that the United States will relent concerning its opposition to the controversial proposal for an oil pipeline through Iran , he smiles and says , " No way . " It is business as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has not been seen in Azerbaijan since the days of the first oil barons . Indeed , as recently as five years ago , there was very little of anything here . The Hyatt itself was once the Nachijivan Hotel , a Soviet-run establishment sorely lacking in the current amenities . With the reconfigured industry still in the largely exploratory early-oil stage , the promised real money has yet to roll in . But confidence is very high . Why else would Brzezinski and hundreds of other oilmen be here if the country was not about to get rich ? THE SIX DOLLARS " Where 's my six dollars ? " That 's what the " normal people " in Azerbaijan want to know in these boom times , says Rauf Talishinsky , the urbane editor of Ayna Zerkola , a popular weekly newspaper . The six dollars has become something of a national obsession in Azerbaijan . " It is a matter of global market arithmetic-what the World Bank , the IMF , and the oil companies call nation building . For every dollar of profit in the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-oil economy . " The global scramble for natural resources has changed since the late nineteenth century , when Cecil Rhodes left England for southern Africa , cornered 90 percent of the world 's diamond market , and wound up having three separate countries named after him , plus a dog ( the Rhodesian ridgeback ) . The ideal modern production-sharing agreement between " source country " and " multinational supplier " is supposed to be more of a win-win thing . That 's what President Aliyev was looking for in the 1994 agreement between his government and a consortium of international oil companies . In fact , as many of the expat oilmen crowding downtown Baku agree , for a country that until quite recently had no such thing as contract law ( not to mention tax , banking , or export law ) , when it came to the so-called contract of the century , Aliyev cut a heck of a deal for his country .

They seem undeterred by the fact that it is one of the dirtiest bodies of water in the world , a repository of decades of oil-industry spillage and seepage . // One hundred fifty miles southwest of Baku , the distribution of this metaphorical six dollars ( the price of a glass of orange juice at the Hyatt ) is a particularly pressing matter . There are several refugee camps here in the heavily fortified southwestern corner of Azerbaijan . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region ( 1992-94 ) , which left twenty thousand people dead and the victorious Armenians in control of 20 percent of Azeri territory , there are now more than one million refugees , or what the United Nations calls IDPs ( internally displaced persons ) , in Azerbaijan . This amounts to approximately 13 percent of the total population , the highest such ratio in the world . Considered by many to be the inevitable legacy of Leninist divide-and-rule ethnic gerrymanderingwhich in 1923 established a primarily Armenian enclave within the territory of Azerbaijan-the war for the former Autonomous Oblast of Mountainous Karabakh ( " Black Garden " ) , while not waged on the cataclysmic scale of Bosnia or engendering as much Western ink as Chechnya , has nonetheless taken its place in the knockabout moshpit of post-Soviet sectarian conflicts . A ceasefire has held since 1994 , but there are no ongoing negotiations . With little settled , defeat continues to fester in the Azeri national mind . Worst of all are the refugee camps : one ca n't drive very far in Azerbaijan without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeshift tents , railway cars , and holes in the ground . Ninety-six-year-old Vafa lives in one refugee settlement . The children have no future here , he says , as he sits by his earthen dugout shelter , staring at a group of young boys playing in a dusty field . Rail-thin and silver-eyed , Vafa tells his visitors that back home in " beautiful " Lachin , a now Armenian-occupied mountain town , it was nothing to be ninety-six . Many people survived well past one hundred . To live so long in such a beautiful place was considered a great gift from God . As for being in " this hell , " which is what Vafa calls the camp where he and 6,500 other refugees have lived since the Armenian takeover of Lachin in May 1992 , the old man says he wishes he were dead . If he were , he would n't have to endure being where the nearest drinking water is more than a mile away and the earth is so dry " you ca n't even plant a tree so you can sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he says , is looking at the children . According to studies conducted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , almost every child living in the Azeri camps suffers from some degree of malnutrition . It is unlikely that any of them will live to ninety-six . " They 'll be lucky to last half that long , " Vafa predicts . Things are even bleaker in Saatli , where refugees live in a mile-long line of railway cars . In summer , temperatures in the metal carriages can reach 125 degrees . Smoke from burning dung used as fuel in winter has caused serious outbreaks of asthma . Taped to one railway car wall , alongside torn Bruce Lee posters , is a handwritten list of towns in Nagorno-Karabakh and the dates on which they were taken by Armenian forces .

Whenever anyone dies , he says , their body is driven as close to their former home as can be done without the drivers being shot , and there it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where four thousand people have been quartered for three years , patience has all but run out . Here , when aid workers arrive , there are no welcoming glasses of tea , no handshakes . Why has n't the doctor been to the camp ? people yell . Why have n't materials been provided to fix torn tents ? In the crowd is a man who gives his name as Ilyas . To say that Ilyas-who is in his early thirties and has dark pinpoint eyes-exudes anger would be to miss the point . Kafkaesque disbelief is more like it . Before the war , Ilyas taught chemistry in high school . He was married , with two young children . When the Armenians started bombing his town , Agdam , Ilyas sent his family to Baku . He never heard from them again . Escaping the war zone , he searched in vain for a year ; now he believes his wife left him for another man . Without home or money , he wound up in the tent camp . He says , " For me to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Photograph Photograph Above : Baku 's post-Soviet cosmopolitanism is manifest in such establishments as Mugam , a club in the Old City . Opposite : There is no shortage of stylish clubs to choose from . // As a teacher , Ilyas often discussed Azerbaijan 's oil industry in his classes . The " science of petroleum " was an important part of the nation 's history , he says . His own grandfather was an oil worker back in Soviet times . Listening to the radio in his tent , he 's heard about the fifth Caspian Sea Oil and Gas Exhibition currently underway in Baku , which he describes as a gathering of " rich foreigners eating in restaurants . " Considering his situation and that of the other refugees , Ilyas feels only despair . " In the old oil boom , when Azeris became rich , they helped other Azeris , " he points out . Many of those first oil barons , cognizant that oil was " the property of God , " spent much of their fortunes for the greater good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , " Ilyas says . " Many of these oil companies here now are American . Americans have never helped Azerbaijan . We have lost all trust in the Americans . What might they do for us now ? " This seems a reasonable question , one worth pondering a few nights later at the American Embassy in Baku . Located in one of the nineteenth-century oil boom 's most elegant buildings , the embassy is hosting a garden party in honor of delegates to the oil show . The keynote speaker at the party is the U.S. Commerce Department Under Secretary of International Trade , David Aaron . That Azerbaijan is a country of " singular strategic and economic importance . . . a good place to do business " is the message he will bring President Clinton , Aaron tells the assembled oilies . And things will be even better once 907 becomes history , the Under Secretary announces . With this , a cheer rises over the embassy 's garden . Product of a well-heeled lobbying program by Armenian-Americans , section 907 of the Freedom Support Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertaining to the emerging nations of the former Soviet Union ; it officially named Azerbaijan as the aggressor in the Nagorno-Karabakh war , resulting in fullscale U.S. sanctions against the Azeris . Since then Azerbaijan has n't received a penny of American economic aid-the only former Soviet republic ( including President Alexander Lukashenko 's neo-fascist , mafia-prone Belarus ) to be so denied . For the Azeris , who point out that the entire conflict took place on their still-occupied soil and who consider themselves staunchly proAmerican , section 907 is galling and incomprehensible . Standing amid the corporate cheerers at this gathering , one can feel how the tide has begun to turn on 907 , and on political/environmental sanctions in general . In the age of the global market , the global marketeers make the rules . And it has not escaped their notice that compared to Azerbaijan , Armenia is a resource-poor , hard-scrabble land . Certainly there is no oil there . As evidenced by the greatly appreciated milliondollar gift to Azeri refugees from the Unocal Corporation , 907 does not preclude contributions from the private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After opening the oil show the previous day , President Aliyev , accompanied by his Dolph Lundgren look-alike Russian bodyguards , chats with representatives of Exxon . Asked what was discussed , Exxon execs say Aliyev was keen to hear about the company 's potential to help Azerbaijan in the " environmental sector , " most specifically through Exxon 's Save the Tiger Fund , a campaign pledging to protect the endangered big cats throughout the world . Upon hearing " But there are n't any tigers in Azerbaijan , " the men from Exxon rebut vigorously , " Well , there used to be . " They cite the Caspian tiger , a leading Eurasian predator ten to twenty thousand years ago . In Azerbaijan , the Save the Tiger program would take on " a symbolic meaning , " one executive explains , noting that President Aliyev has been keen on Exxon 's promotional use of big cat Beanie Babies . " He took two ! " enthuses the exec , noting that the company is also offering for sale a Save the Tiger kit containing a National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds may go to aid environmental projects in Azerbaijan . If anywhere ever needed investment in environmental protection , it 's Azerbaijan . The country with the world 's oldest petroleum industry also has the longest history of hydrocarbon pollution . Heydar Aliyev may have received an Order of Lenin in 1981 for spectacular increases in Azeri cotton and grape crop yields , but these goals were achieved through the equally spectacular use of DDT and dangerous chemical fertilizers , with predictably unfortunate consequences for soil and water quality . The potability of the Kur ( or Kura ) River , the main source of Baku 's water supply , has been seriously undermined . But when it comes to Azeri eco-nightmares , there is little to compare to Sumgayit , the famously apocalyptic " chemical city " thirty miles north of the capital . In the years following World War II , thirty-plus major factories were constructed here , including those manufacturing DDT , various chlorinated compounds , and the toxic gas lindane . There were very few environmental controls ; almost all waste products were dispersed into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their headlights on at noon to see through the murk ; women 's nylons were said to disintegrate upon contact with the air . Nonetheless , considered a worker 's paradise because of its relatively high wages , Sumgayit at one time had more than four hundred thousand residents , making it the second largest city in Azerbaijan . Tens of thousands of these people have since left . Today , with all but two or three of the factories shut down and 90 percent of the population unemployed , Sumgayit is a quieter , albeit still chilling , place . Under stark blue skies , with birds chirping , one can tour the section of a local cemetery that is reserved for babies and children . By the wide beach , which resembles a more dystopian Daytona , half-drowned buses and abandoned ships dot the horizon as dead seals roll in the languid tide . Nevertheless , more than seventyfive thousand refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh have moved to Sumgayit in the past five years . Some of these displaced people can be seen skulking around shuttered factories , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondhand toxins provide a small-business opportunity here . Refugees take the poisons to Baku , where the shout of " Chlor ! " means the chlorine bleach peddler is in the streets again .

" An ad-hoc Drano of widely varying composition , it is guaranteed to unclog Baku 's notoriously balky plumbing . Prolonged contact with pipes is not recommended . Not everyone is unhappy to call Sumgayit home . Certainly there are problems here , says sixtyish , thicktrunked Mustafayev , tending his small garden in the shadow of the now-closed glass factory where he worked for twenty-seven years . Glass from this very factory was shipped " across all of the Soviet Union , to Kazakhstan and the Ukraine . " This is something to be proud of , Mustafayev says ruefully . Honest people worked hard there . That is what is wrong with the " new " Azerbaijan : people are ashamed of the past . He was never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how life is , and it is stupid to throw away everything . Then Mustafayev reaches down to pick up one of the long purple eggplants he 's grown in his garden . If Sumgayit is so awful , so full of death , he demands to know , thrusting the vegetable out in front of him , how can such healthy plants come from the ground ? Eventually , as with the discussion of so much else in Azerbaijan , talk of the environment turns to oil . Walking through Bibi-Eybat , one of the oldest oil fields on the shore of Baku Bay , one can see what a century of largely unregulated oil drilling can do to a stretch of real estate . As if from habit , hundreds of " nodding donkey " oil drills , their corroded gears whining in the wind , still scavenge the long-exhausted shoreline reserves , seeking to pump up one last stray molecule of hydrocarbon . Derricks , some as many as seventy-five years old , rust in the scratchy midafternoon light . Everywhere there are huge pools of spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of discarded furniture , children 's toys , and ancient newspapers . Much of the seepage , containing mercury and other heavy metals as well as radioactive material such as radium 226 , has penetrated the water table or been washed into the adjacent shoreline . As a result , Baku Bay-which is all but totally depleted of oxygen-has become a dead zone ; it is one of the dirtiest major bodies of water in the world . Given this tableau , the advent of the new oil boom , with its hundreds of projected offshore drilling rigs , sub-sea pipelines , and supertanker traffic , creates a potentially explosive ecological scenario , especially given the uniquely vulnerable nature of the Caspian Sea itself . As a river-fed brackish lake ( 88 percent of the water comes from the Volga , Europe 's longest river ; the Kur ; and the Terek ) with no outlet to the ocean , the Caspian has a limited ability to flush contaminants . A major accident here-given the hundreds of endemic species of fish and plants-could result in disastrous biodiversity loss . Added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einar Tresselt , Norwegian geologist and senior executive at the Azerbaijan International Operating Company ( AIOC ) , the leading consortium of foreign oil producers , says , " The Caspian is one odd duck , full of unsolved mystery . " For instance , no one is quite sure why , having dropped almost thirty feet between the 1930s and the mid-1970s , the Caspian 's water level has risen eight feet since then , resulting in widespread flooding and property loss . Also enigmatic are the " mud volcanoes " studding the southern seabed . These clay-belching calderas , some of which are several hundred feet high , are capable of quick , unpredictable growth-something to consider when laying extensive undersea pipelines and drilling what will be some of the deepest wells in the world . Beyond this are the environmental hazards involved with land pipelines . The existing Soviet-built conduits , especially those passing through Georgia , have been subject to incessant leakage , often in ecologically sensitive areas such as wetlands . These pipelines will be improved and upgraded , but accidents are difficult to prevent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of the UN-sponsored Caspian Environment Project ( CEP ) , which promises what coordinator David Aubrey , a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts , calls realistic sustainability goals . The project includes the bold and wholly indispensable involvement of neighboring Iran as a full partner . Also " realistic " is CEP 's stated desire to work closely with the AIOC and other private oil producers . " If we want to have success in protecting the Caspian region , we have to create a situation everyone can live with , " Aubrey says . " We wo n't get anywhere attempting to ignore the economic imperatives . " The AIOC/CEP meld of Big Oil and Big Relief can not but be a vast improvement on the Soviet " zero tolerance " policy of first setting up **25;764;TOOLONG eco-rules and then collecting bribes when the dictates were broken . Still , as for the raising of ecological consciousness in Azerbaijan , Shahin Panahov , director of ECORES , one of the country 's few active environmental organizations , despairs . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any environmental education , " he remarks glumly , holding up a softcover textbook in which an airplane is shown dusting fields with DDT . The caption reads " For the natural goodness of our crops . " Other pages detailing " our waters " show pictures of blue whales , not known to frequent Caspian sea lanes . The text is obviously from the Soviet era , but it is no relic . As Panahov points out , the book 's reprint date is 1997 , which is when it was distributed to Azeri fourth-graders . Photograph Photograph Below : One of the Caspian Sea 's fastdisappearing sturgeons goes on the market . Opposite : Visitors can take tea beside the " eternally " afire Burning Hill . // One Azeri eco-issue that captures the attention of Moscow blini-eaters and Manhattan socialites alike is the caviar emergency . The vast majority of the world 's sturgeon population , source of the most fetishized fish eggs , reside in the Caspian Sea . Often called a living fossil , the spike-snouted sturgeon is among the most venerable species on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the highly prized beluga sturgeon , as well as the smaller Russian and sevruga , has been disappearing at an astonishing rate . As recently as the mid-1980s , more than 30,000 tons of sturgeon were taken by Soviet and Iranian fishermen ; by 1995 the official catch was down to 3,100 tons . Likewise , whereas in the 1970s it was not uncommon to find a nine-hundred-pound , sixty-year-old beluga ( they have been known to live a century and weigh two thousand pounds ) , the current average weight of a fish caught is around eighty pounds . One reason for the decline is the damming of the Kur River in Azerbaijan , which has hindered sturgeon-spawning patterns . And many fish have been poisoned by the giant gas-extraction plant built at the mouth of the Volga River . Yet the main problem is overfishing . Back in the days of the Soviet Union , strict quotas on the sturgeon catch were enforced by the caviar commissars , but since then , the market has become a bit more ad hoc . A visit to the nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kur in Neftechala , seventy-five miles south of Baku , underscores the dire prognosis . Just the day before , 1.3 million sturgeon hatchlings were released from the factory 's spawning pools into the river , from which they will enter the Caspian . If things were " normal ; " the factory manager shouts over the piercing caws of several hundred nesting crows , a goodly portion of these hatchlings would return in about fifteen years , matured and full of caviar . But things are " not normal . " " Very few , very few will come back , " the manager says with disgust . " Some will go elsewhere , some will not bear eggs , the rest will be murdered . " " Murder ? I would n't call it murder , " says Azad as he flicks a five-inch machete-like blade through the fetid air of a makeshift hut on the Caspian shore . A squat , burly-chested man in his late twenties , Azad reveals that he has been a caviar poacher for almost two years . Mostly he goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets , which catch sturgeons along with everything else . With large spoons , he scoops out the eggs and discharges them into big plastic buckets , ready to be either processed and packaged for the Baku black market or immediately shipped to Moscow . It 's a dangerous business . Two years ago in Dagestan , sixty-seven people were killed in a war between caviar mafiosi and local police , a clash that included the bombing of a ninestory building where border guards were housed . The situation in Azerbaijan is n't that tense , but still , Azad says , winking , it 's never a bad idea to keep a couple of Kalashnikovs under the bed . At the local market-where people will swear on a stack of Korans that a flotilla of Armenian submarines has been torpedoing innocent sturgeons with underwater machine guns-Azad sells a kilo and a half of black caviar for about eight " shirvans , " or $20 . " In America it is $100 an ounce , " he snorts , indicating he 'll never see money like that . To be Azeri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his life story . As a teenager from a poor family , he dreamed of going to Moscow State University , but then the Soviet Union fell apart . After that , he was sent to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh . Near the Iranian border , Azad 's unit was routed by Armenians . " The Russians supplied them with everything , led them into battle with strategy . Our troops were disorganized . We had no chance . " He was very happy to get out alive . " Azerbaijan . . . I did n't care about Azerbaijan , " he says . Since then , Azad has changed his mind . He heard that mujahideen fighters from Afghanistan , men who 'd thrown the Russians out of their country , had come to Azerbaijan to aid their Muslim brothers against the Christian Armenians but soon left saying , " The Azeris did not want to fight . " This embarrassed him . " I am not a good Muslim , I do not pray , " he says , " but this was a dishonor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soon there will be war again , and this time it will be different . This time we will have the better weapons . " Azad is certain that oil money would rout the Armenians . With oil money , Azerbaijan would be whole again . This is something to think about back in Baku , driving past Shahidlar Khiyabani , or " Martyr 's Lane , " where many of the dead from the fighting in NagornoKarabakh are now buried , red carnations surrounding their black marble gravestones . What might the Hyatt oilmen think of the caviar poacher Azad 's vision of jihad ? The answer is clear enough from reading one of the oil industry 's several high-priced newsletters : anyplace with a massive refugee problem , 70 percent unemployment , and no clear successor to a one-man ruler is no shoo-in for long-term stability . Yes , Azerbaijan could blow up . But there are other places to headquarter the new Caspian oil boom . Kazakhstan does n't have the creature comforts of Baku , but it does have plenty of oil . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , the big players in the global economy must assess the risks and be flexible , ever ready to move on . Photograph In common with most Azeris of modest means , oil workers , below , hope for a future made comfortable by trickle-down prosperity from the country 's latest oil boom . // THE BURNING HILL For hundreds of years , mariners had noted the place called Neft Dashlari , or Oily Rocks-forty miles from the Absheron shore-where the Caspian became shallow and where large black rocks , surrounded by a rainbow sheen , broke the surface . It was here , during the 1940s , that the Soviets dug the first offshore well , consisting of a hammocklike platform over a rock outcrop . Soon a thirty-foot trestle was built across the twelve-foot-deep sea to a second group of rocks . More platforms were constructed , each attached to the last by a causeway . Without precedent , Oily Rocks continued to be developed according to no particular master plan : structures were added as deemed necessary , roadway pilings fanned out in irregular patterns . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caspian , linked by 120 miles of thoroughfare . Nearly three thousand oil workers can still be found working one-week shifts here , whiling away their evenings gambling at backgammon in cramped dormitory rooms built in 1961 . But time and the sea have taken quite a toll on Oily Rocks . Large sections of causeway have been washed away by storms , or they have simply collapsed through neglect . Drill towers have sunk into the water , with only their crowns now visible above the waves . Recent fluctuations in sea level have accentuated the rust-never-sleeps motif convoluted loopings of steam-pipe shed orange flakes , and ruined potbellied separator tanks lie like sleeping hippos in the noonday sun . A hulking limestone statue depicting the glorious unity of oil workers-and a companion fifteen-foot-high mosaic of Lenin-bear permanent water stains . Encountering the tumbledown setting today , it is difficult to believe that Oily Rocks ' causeway design was once considered a serious challenge to the now-standard Western-style detached platform towers . Oily Rocks appears to be just another loser , an inherently flawed , defeated system , cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocks . Of the so-called natural resources worth plundering , oil has the most ghosts . After all , it used to be alive . Oil is us , or at least the echo of life that has gone before us . It 's stupefying : all that natural history-all that past-blown right out the exhaust pipe . In the end , though , if you want to understand something about oil in Azerbaijan , you have to come to the Burning Hill , a short distance from Baku . It 's not exactly certain when the Burning Hill , a forty-foothigh limestone berm rich in surface hydrocarbons , caught fire ; no one can remember when it was n't burning . During World War II the Red Army , fearful that German fliers might use the blaze as a landmark , tried to bury the hill under tons of cement . The effort was largely futile-the hill continued to burn , giving rise to the common belief that its enduring flame might be imbued with some of the magical qualities that the ancient Zoroastrians attributed to the atesh adran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light . Soon , people say , the eternal flame at the Burning Hill will go out . The hydrocarbon reservoir beneath it is almost used up . Even sacred fire seems to be a finite substance . But tonight the fire 's hot enough to sit in its roaring glow and watch the slickly dressed , young Azeri lovers who have just pulled up in a late-model Datsun . You might think they were yuppies , which is another sign of progress ; six years ago , when even buying a roll of tape was a major problem , Azerbaijan had no yuppies . Giggling like characters in an early Fellini movie , the couple play tag with the eternal fire as if its flames were waves at the beach . Then they pause to talk on their cell phones before going over to the other side of the Burning Hill to make love . Sidebar Oil-and its fire-have long been a defining force in Azerbaijan . The ancient Greeks said it was near here , in the Caucasus Mountains , that the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Azerbaijan , its neighboring states , and foreign oilmen can begin to count the profits from the CC spian Sea 's new oil boom , they must agree on a pipeline route . Delivering oil from the landlocked sea to world markets is not just a challenge for engineers ; it 's a test of political power and ingenuity . And it will involve the most important throw of the dice in The Great Game . Sidebar The primary So , , iet-built pipeLine , from Baku to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea , is too small , plus it goes through Chechnya , recentLy at war with Moscow . After co itly reconstruction , the secondary line-from Baku to the Black Sea at Supsa , Georgia-is almost complete , but it skirts Abkhazia , which wants to separate from Georgia and whose fighters are rumored to have said they will blow up the line . Both Black . ea routes entail the use of supertankers that must cross the Black Sea and then traverse the already dangerously overtrafficked and navigationally difficult Bosporus Str , iit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish government , which fears further ecological damage in the famous waterway . Sidebar The United States , never a small player , favors the establishment of an east-west corridor that would funnel Caspian oil to Ceyhan on Turkey 's Mediterranean coast . The fact that the Ceyf an area recently suffered a massive earthquake in which 150 people were killed and several thousand injured is considered no large obstacle . But with the volatile global market and recent drops in the price of oil , Baku-Ceyhan , by far the most expensive potential main export pipeline , is in trouble . An Iranian path , south from Baku to the Persian Gulf-the obvious crow's-fly option but , until quite recently , politically unthinkable-has emerged as a dark-horse candidate . Sidebar War with Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has Left 13 percent of Azeri people homeless in their own land . Most are encamped in southwestern Azerbaijan , which goes by the bitter sobriquet Refugeestan .

Sidebar The world 's most prized caviar comes from Caspian Sea sturgeons . The fish are disappearing at an alarming rate , chiefly because of overfishing but also because of pollution and disturbed spawning .
