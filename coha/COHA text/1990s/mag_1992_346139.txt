WHAT REMAINS OF YUGOSLAVIA PRETENDS TO BE A country , but even its own army does n't seem to know where its borders are . Last Monday Serbia and Montenegro , the only two of the six republics not to declare independence , announced the establishment of a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The constitution of the remapped Yugoslavia recognizes , at least for now , that its territory ends at the shared border with Bosnia-Herzegovina . Diplomats optimistically interpreted that fact as a renunciation of Belgrade 's prior claims that Serbs in any of the republics had a right to belong to an expanded Serbian state . <P> But try telling Belgrade that its own constitution proves that the Serb-led Yugoslav army is now an occupying force on the foreign soil of Bosnia . One week into a new cease-fire , fighting continued unabated in at least five towns , as well as the capital city of Sarajevo . In a letter to Bosnian officials , army chief of staff General Blagoje Adzic refused to remove his troops , which number as many as 100,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
