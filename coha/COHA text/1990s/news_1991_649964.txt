##@x <p> America has many contradictions , but none greater than the fact that it was founded by puritans and yet invented tolerance . The tension between the busybodies of 1620 and the free spirits of 1776 has often marked American history : the puritan had the upper hand in Prohibition , the permissive had it in Woodstock . <p> Like all things American , the contrast knob is turned up highest in California . San Franciscans treat homosexuals almost without prejudice , but 60 percent of Californians tell pollsters they want contraceptives forcibly implanted into drug-taking single mothers ( thus simultaneously sanctioning fornication and eugenics ) . Los Angeles allows people of every color and creed complete freedom to sink or swim , yet employs a police force notorious for its racism and violence . <p> America 's great tradition is to be puritanical only about private behavior . And although its public policy has often been strict ( color bars , Prohibition , the death penalty ) , it has been far more permissive than most countries in its respect for civil liberties . Increasingly , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Worse , they are ever more ready to believe that the answer to every problem is to pass a law . <p> To a lot of Americans , it now seems that prosperity can be bought like insurance . If you lose your job you can sue for the mental distress of being fired . If your bank goes broke , the Government has insured your deposits . If your marriage goes wrong you can divorce  --  and then sue for a share of the money your spouse would have earned had he or she not given up a lucrative job . If you drive drunk and crash you can sue somebody for failing to warn you to stop drinking . There is always somebody else to blame . <p> Contrast this with the puritanism directed at others . Too many Americans expect greater abstinence and sexual restraint of their politicians ( Gary Hart , John Tower ) than they do of their teen-age children . They reprimand a neighbor for kissing her boyfriend goodnight on the steps of her house and so lowering the tone of the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the parking of pickups in driveways for the same reason ( in Illinois ) . They insist on conformity . They treat other adults as though they were children . <p> Much intolerance is inconsistent . America does not punish pot smokers more heavily than murderers . But it does ( in some states ) mandate prison sentences for someone caught with a few grams of cocaine , yet happily allows him to buy a pistol . A pistol is a lot more anti-social than a joint . <p> To somebody who believes in tolerance , though , puritan America is not as scary as punitive America . <p> Crime ? The majority 's answer is loud : more police , more death sentences , more mandatory long sentences  --  yet little community policing , little attention to prevention of any kind . In 10 years , spending on criminal justice has risen twice as fast as spending on health . <p> The homeless ? Unable to afford to build cheap housing , city governments have begun to do the popular thing instead : ban begging . Health ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical bills is to force them on to employers or taxpayers , which only makes them more uncontrollable and unaccountable . Race ? Pass laws that require positive discrimination and job quotas for minorities , and let merit go hang . <p> Twenty years ago America thought it could bribe problems away with money ; now it seems to think it can banish them with laws . The better answer is to alter incentives so that a problem disappears without the need to create outlaws . <p> On pollution , for instance , the conventional response has rapidly become a moral reprimand preferably aimed at industry rather than consumers : ban sulphur emissions and disposable nappies diapers , leave petrol untaxed and road use free . Never mind that sulphur does far less damage to forests than car exhaust , or that cotton nappies cause four times as much water pollution and twice as much air pollution to make and get rid of as disposable ones . <p> The most pernicious form of intolerance is " political correctness , " because it comes disguised as tolerance . Imposing a new orthodoxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in marked contrast to the freedom and tolerance with which those same students were treated by their parents and schoolteachers just a few years earlier . They were given unimaginable license to drive cars , stay out late , watch violent films , earn a living at supermarket checkouts . <p> In 1988 , 38 percent of 17-year-old American girls had had sex , compared with 23 percent in 1973 . As for younger children , parents prefer to nurture their self-esteem than use discipline . Teen-agers are treated as adults . Yet when they get to university they are suddenly plunged back into a world of condescending " because I say so " conformity . <p> Social engineering is out of fashion in Eastern Europe . In its place there could , with any luck , emerge a culture that recognizes the need to achieve social order by offering incentives , not by handing down instructions . The pioneer of that philosophy was America . If its people go the other way , they wo n't be the only losers . @@649964 Maine , 1855 <p> " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My father 's words echoed in my head as I stood in the Augusta station and said good bye to Horace Tabor on a bitterly cold spring morning . <p> I clasped my hands together for warmth and to keep them from trembling . " You 'll be careful ? Father was right , you know . The Abolitionists and the pro-slavers wo n't ever compromise . You ... you might be hurt . " Or even killed some place in Kansas . Bleeding Kansas was what they were calling it then , a name that only increased my anxiety . <p> But I did n't say those words aloud . To speak them would be tempting fate . Besides , over the last two years I 'd supported Horace 's decision to join the New England Immigrant Aid Company , a group of Abolitionists whose intent was to populate Kansas and by sheer numbers defeat those who would vote to bring another slave state into the Union . Instead , I bit my lip to keep from crying . <p> Horace was impatient-a young man in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquering the unknown Territory of Kansas . He had no qualms about leaving his future bride behind to wait and worry , and wanted no part of tears or mournful farewell . <p> " There 's not a pro-slavery squatter born who could lick me , Gusta . This is my chance for a place of my own . Our chance , and I 'm taking it . " He put his big hands on my shoulders and pulled me close . <p> Actually my entire family approved of his idea . Like the rest of New England , we 'd heard and read about the impassioned speeches of Eli Thayer as he toured the North in search of support for his army of immigrants , and we 'd applauded when Amos Lawrence , a Pierce distant relative , began pouring huge amounts of money into the Immigrant Aid Company 's coffers . <p> We Pierces were Unitarians , and we believed in the rights of men-and women , believed that slavery was unjust and a crime before God , and that it was our human duty to do all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a few years before , the publication of Harriet Stowe 's Uncle Tom 's Cabin had roused not only our town but much of the North . Mrs. Stowe was , at that time , living in Brunswick , Maine , in belief and heart one of us , an Abolitionist with a spine of granite and a way with words . And , though it was mentioned only by inference , it was understood that there was a house by the Kennebec River in Augusta with a secret room built solely to harbor runaway slaves . <p> Everyone we knew , with the exception of our cousin , President Franklin Pierce , was opposed to slavery in any form , but so far , at least in Maine , the opposition had been verbal . In Kansas men were killing each other over the right to own slaves , and , according to Father , Cousin Frank was to blame . The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which repealed the earlier Missouri Compromise , was , as Father put it : " Frank 's way of avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , damn his hide ! " <p> In the end , he predicted , only war would solve the slavery problem . War and bloodshed . And the man I 'd loved from my first glimpse of him was off to do battle . <p> Two years before , my father , William Pierce , had been awarded the contract to cut the granite and rebuild the Augusta State Asylum . On the train to Boston to hire more workers , he 'd met Horace Tabor and his brother John , both of them master stonecutters in search of jobs , and both of them also fellow Abolitionists and excited by the promise of free land in Kansas and the chance to strike a blow for their belief . <p> Was it fate ? I 've often wondered . Is the tapestry of our lives already stitched and in place , so that all we can do is follow the threads that bind us ? Whatever the answer , I fell in love at my first sight of Horace as he jumped down from the wagon and stood staring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with broad shoulders and a stonecutter 's massive but careful hands , and at dinner that night his dark eyes twinkled whenever he caught me looking at him . Twinkled , as if he knew what I was feeling and felt the same . <p> That night , and every successive night , the talk at the table was of slavery and abolition , and I can still see Horace 's face when he realized we were related , both to our weak President and to Lawrence , the fierce philanthropist . <p> " You 've chosen the right side , " he boomed , barely restraining himself from pounding a huge fist on my mother 's well-laid table . " By gad , sir , the South , with Pierce 's blessing , will split the country in half ! " <p> Father paused in the act of carving the roast . " The country is already split . If and when you go to Kansas , I believe you 'll find the war has already begun . On a small scale , " he added , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my lap and prayed Horace would n't go . Surely there was enough to keep him here , safe and well employed , and in no danger . It would n't be the last time I uttered such a prayer , only to find it useless in the face of Horace 's determination . But I was helpless in the throes of my first adult emotion . <p> Something of my intensity must have reached him , for he leaned across the table and said : " What do you think of all this , Miss Augusta ? Give us a woman 's opinion . " <p> He 'd picked me out ! Me ! I unfolded my hands and dropped my napkin on the floor , but when I answered , my voice did n't waver . " It 's written that we 're all created equal , Mister Tabor . And I believe that 's so . Not only men , but women as well . What equality means is not that we 're all born with the same strengths , but that we should all have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to fight for that chance . " <p> This was nothing more than what we all believed and lived by , but Horace was impressed . As he told me later , he 'd not met many women who 'd been educated or who were even able to express themselves . He reached for his water glass and raised it in a toast . <p> " Well said . I salute you . " Then he swallowed the contents in one gulp . <p> Father raised his glass , too . " My daughter has spoken for all of us . We believe in the rights of man . And woman , " he added with a nod toward Mother and my sisters . <p> Stunned by the unaccustomed praise , I said nothing , but from that night on Horace sought me out at every opportunity . My sisters teased me about my beau , my mother in her roundabout fashion urged caution , and I ignored them all . At times I believed I 'd die , if not from love then from the sheer excitement of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapping my whole family up in his enthusiasm . That was one of his greatest charms-that boundless , fevered way of dreaming and making the achievement of those dreams sound both practical and assured . Even when he walked , he seemed to be filled with energy , always headed somewhere and sure of what awaited him . <p> From that first day , my health , which had kept me bedridden for so much of childhood , began to improve . I willed it to improve , with all the strength I had . From that day my life took on meaning . And it was with my family 's blessing that Horace was now leaving Maine in search of a homestead , a place in which he and I could make our home . <p> " Write me , " I whispered . " And ... and remember your promise not to drink very much . " <p> As soon as the words came out , I regretted them . He frowned at me , his eyes dark . " You worry too much about nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as his strengths . He loved the company of men , the adulation of women . He loved politics and the idea that he was striking a blow against slavery . And he never hesitated to speak his mind to anyone who 'd listen . <p> " Take care , " I said , my voice drowned out by the whistle of the train . <p> He bent and kissed me , his lips warm in the cold air , and I clung to him , attempting to memorize the feel of his strong arms and how he towered over me , blocking out the gray sky . <p> " Stay well . " He let me go , and picked up his bag . " I 'll write . I 'll be back as soon as I can . And ... , " - he grinned- " I 'll try to be moderate in all my bad habits . " <p> Then he was gone . I stood watching till the train was out of sight , then walked slowly back to where my brother Frank was waiting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we headed back to the house that would , I knew , feel empty without Horace to bring it to life . <p> Keep safe , keep safe , keep safe , I prayed all the way home , but there was , of course , no way to know if my prayer had been heard , or if it would be answered . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
