Fletch Reflected By Gregory Mcdonald Random House Gregory Mcdonald 1 " Faoni . " In fact , he was answering the telephone at Andy Cyst 's desk in the huge Global Cable News building in Virginia . He had no desk , or telephone , of his own . The switchboard knew he was working with Andy Cyst . " Fletch ? " " Who is this ? " The young woman 's voice said , " Is this Fletch ? " " Yeah . Jack . Faoni . Fletch . " " I know your name is Jack Faoni . The weekend we spent together you had me call you Fletch . " " When was that ? " " Skiing . In Stowe , Vermont . A few years ago . We met there . At The Shed . You were with some other guys from a lumber camp . Playing your guitar . People were buying you beer to keep you playing . Well , I sort of kidnapped you . First , I kidnapped your guitar . " Her voice was low , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to get your guitar back , I grabbed you . It was snowing . You were very hot . I ripped your shirt . I pulled it down off your shoulders . Do you remember the snowflakes falling on your sweating shoulders while we kissed ? You sizzled . " " Good grief ! Whoever you are , woman , you just elevated my temperature by more than a little . I 'm hot now . " Sticking a finger inside his shirt collar , Jack scanned the huge , brightly lit , colorful , air-conditioned room filled with journalists ' workstations . " I was n't a minute ago . " " You werevery playful . Silly . You do n't remember me ? " " I do . " She had coal black hair , very wide-set coal-black eyes . . . And her name was ? " I remember you were n't there when I woke up . " " I had to meet my father early for Belgian waffles . It really was n't a weekend we spent together . Just a few lovely hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to run through the snow in a flannel shirt torn to shreds . Thanks for leaving me my guitar , anyway . " " You use your hands beautifully . " " Why did n't you come back ? Leave a note ? Something ? " " I had to ski with my father . Then he drove me back to Poughkeepsie . " " I waited . " He had not waited long . The snow was pure powder , the skiing too good to miss . " I was n't sure you were n't a dream . " " Anyway , I 've been seeing your name on GCN the last few days . Those great stories about The Tribe . " " Thanks . I guess . " " You 're working for GCN now ? " " I guess so . I 'm here . They 've used everything I 've brought them . " " That 's great . But they never showed your face on television . If it was your story , why did n't they use you on camera ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't ? A lot do . " " People come to recognize you . Then you ca n't do the kind of stories I want to do . " " Oh . You must have been working on that story a long time . " " It took a long time to set up . Once it got going , it went quickly . Very quickly . " " So guess where I am . " " You like games , do n't you ? " " Yeah . I do . " " Let me think . . . You 're in jail ? " " No . " " You 're in hospital with some horrible disease the doctor says you must tell me about ? " " No . " " I give up . " Jack rearranged some papers on Andy Cyst 's desk . " Why do n't you remind me of your name , if you ever shared it with me in the first place , tell me where you are , if that 's relevant to the conversation , then tell me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to need a shower . " " We did n't do all that much talking , as I remember . We went at each other like bear cubs . " " I do n't care who you are . I do n't care where you are . I do n't care why you 're calling . Good bye . " " Staufel . " " Is that a name , or an order ? " " Shana Staufel . " " Oh , yes . Shana . So where are you , Shana ? " " Vindemia . " " Vindemia . I 've read that word somewhere . What is it , defunct coal mines in Appalachia , what ? " " One of the biggest estates in America . " " Oh , yeah . In Georgia ? Owned by . . . " " Actually , I 'm calling you from a phone booth outside the Vindemia Gas Station and General Store . The estate has its own little village , complete with chapel , library , and many , many rent-a-cops . " " Cute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Chester Radliegh . He invented the perfect mirror . " " Oh , yeah . The guy who straightened out our left from our right , right from left when we look at ourselves in a mirror . " " Right . Chester Radliegh . Massive implications for industry , science , space . . . " " You sound like you 're quoting from Business Digest . " " I am . I looked him up . Before I met him . " " Boxers appreciate his mirror , too . " " They do ? " " They do n't get blindsided so much these days . Have n't you noticed ? " " Guess I have n't . " " More fights go the whole ten , fifteen rounds now . " " Is that good ? " " Think of the philosophical , psychological , to say nothing of poetic ramifications of the perfect mirror . I mean , for centuries we were seeing ourselves wrong , were n't we ? Not as others saw us , as they say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to meet him . Radliegh must have an interesting mind . To take a thing as ancient and simple as the mirror and realize it was wrong ; it was backward . . . ' In the clear mirror of thy ruling star/ I saw , alas ! , some dread event depend . ' " " Who said that ? " " Before I did ? A guy named Pope . " " I 'm going to marry Chet . " " What 's a Chet ? " " Chester Radliegh , Jr . " " Oh . You called to invite me to your wedding ? I 'll send a present . Shreds of my flannel shirt , as a keepsake , or a dustcloth , whichever you need the more . " " Not exactly . " " What then ? " " To invite you here . " " Where ? Vindemia ? " " Yes . " " You need someone to speak up for you ? A playmate reference , maybe ? " " This is the first time I 've ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't get it . Why would you need me ? Even want me in the same state ? " " You 're an investigative reporter . " " Thanks . " " There 's something real weird about this place . These people . " " Sure . They got very , very rich , very , very fast . Who said , ' Wealth does n't corrupt as much as it reveals ' ? " " Pope ? " " I do n't think so . " " I want you to come here . I can say you 're my cousin . " " As I remember , we look nothing alike . " " Sometimes cousins do n't . You could just be passing by and drop in for a few days . " " Sure . You 're marrying into a maxi-wealthy family , get brought home by Chet ditto to meet Mama , Papa and the Borzoi hound , and your distant relatives start landing on them asking directions to their larder . What kind of an impression would that make ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many people wandering around , you would n't even be noticed . " " Yeah , I do a pretty good imitation of a potted palm . You telling me you think there 's a story for me here somewhere ? What is it ? The guy 's been profiled a million times . A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of physics invents the perfect mirror , makes zillions of dollars between a Tuesday and Friday , buys half the state of Georgia ) builds a fifty room mansion- " " Seventy two . Seventy two rooms . " " Really ? I thought I was exaggerating . " " The roof is five acres . " " Lor ' love a duck ! I 've been on farms smaller than that . " " Five acres , they tell me . It looks it . " " - has a gorgeous , well-behaved family- " " That 's where the profile goes awry . " " They are not a gorgeous , well-behaved family ? " " They 're gorgeous . " She hesitated . " So ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Who ? " " Chester Radliegh . I think his family wants to murder him . His friends . The people who work for him . Everybody around him . I 'm afraid one of them will succeed . " " What on earth makes you say a thing like that ? Is he that much of a bastard ? " " He 's a wonderful man . " " Then why do you say such a thing ? " " I do n't know , exactly . Things are weird here . Little things . Everything is so tight , you know ? Security . Yet , these weird little things keep happening . I think Chester , Mister Radliegh , thinks he has invented the perfect mirror in his family , all the people he has collected around him , except they 're not perfect , they seem to want to leap at him . . . . " Andy Cyst was walking from the administration offices toward his desk . The room was so big Jack thought there was a need for conveyer belts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a world room ; a cosmic room . Jack took his feet off the edge of Andy 's console desk . " . . . That 's why I want you to come here , " Shana continued . " Investigate this . There 's so much tension . I 'm afraid of what 's going to happen . " Jack stretched the muscles of his upper back . He had had an exciting but exhausting few weeks . " Well , I 'd like to meet Mister Radliegh , as I said , " Jack said into the phone , " but I do have a job , I think , and you understand I ca n't drop everything and come to some Valhalla in the sky , pass myself off as some itinerant relation to the daughter-in-law to be , just in case the butler spits in Daddy 's mock turtle soup . You do understand that , do n't you ? " " What can I do to persuade you ? " " Make me believe there 's a story here . " " Is ' story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play the guitar . I 've had you in bed . The whole world has just seen this wonderful expose of The Tribe you 've done . You mean to tell me you do n't care about people ? " " Get some evidence . Find me a plan to collapse those five acres of roof on Chester Radliegh . " " I was hoping you 'd do that . Find evidence , I mean . " " I have a life , lady . " " Lucky you . " " Give me your phone number , just in case old Chester gets carted off to the hospital with a case of botulism , or something . " She recited the main number of the estate . " There 's a switchboard , " she said . " I 'm in the American Girl Rose Suite . " Andy stepped into his workstation . " What does that mean ? " Jack asked . " The suites do n't have numbers . Each is named after a particular flower , or plant . My suite is called the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sounds homey enough . Does it come complete with pricks ? " " Homey enough if your last name is Windsor . Will you at least think about it ? " " I do n't see how I can . " Shana Staufel sighed . " Okay . Well , it was nice meeting you . Nice talking to you . " " Best wishes , " Jack said , " on your marriage . " " A story ? " Andy asked . " A girl . " Jack stood up . " Alex Blair asked me to tell you to come to his office right away . " " Who 's he ? " " His office is down the Central Corridor , right next to the C.E.O . ' s . " Andy sat in his chair . " He 's waiting for you now . " " Okay . " " Jack ? " " Yeah ? " " You know , one of my assignments here is to answer the phone to Mister Fletcher . He 's a stockholder . A director . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know , was a respected journalist , I guess : I 've heard he was ; I 've heard he was n't . Sometimes he calls me three and four times a day . Then weeks will go by when I do n't hear from him at all . When he has story ideas , needs some research done . " " Sounds like a tough assignment . " " No , " Andy said . " It 's interesting . I try to figure out what he 's doing , thinking , what he 's working on by the questions he asks . He 's very oblique . Almost never do his questions mean nothing . Usually something interesting results ; sometimes something sensational . I 'm learning a lot from him . I think I am . It was that way regarding The Tribe story . There were little questions about The Tribe I could have ignored , about a jailbreak in Kentucky , about a woman named Faoni . One huge story developed , and one very good story . " " This guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you meet Mister Fletcher , Jack ? How did your paths cross ? " Jack said , " Ask him . " 2 " Jack ! " Rising from behind his massive mahogany desk , the slim , graying man in the form fitting blue suit seemed genuinely glad to see him . Smiling , he came around the desk and shook Jack 's hand with both of his . " I 've been seeing you around the office all week , of course , but I have n't had the chance to stop and say hello . " His gray eyes were not smiling . " Are you Mister Blair ? " The smiling secretary had nodded Jack through the office door without speaking . " Alex . " The man continued to hold Jack 's hand . " Call me Alex . " Returning to his desk , Blair nearly sang , " What a wonderful story ! So glad to nail those racist bastards ! Wish we could rid the world of that scum for all time ! We 're so damned pleased you brought the story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather swivel chair behind his desk . " Sit down , Jack , sit down ! " Sitting , Jack looked around the office . All the wood was mahogany , or appeared to be . Everything else Jack had seen in the GCN building was glass , steel , plastic-very good plastic , of course . In the mahogany bookcases were television screens , rows of them . " So , " Jack said , " you 're the guy who fixes the t.v. ' s ? " " What ? " Blair followed Jack 's eyes to the rows of t.v. sets . " Oh ! " He chuckled . " A little joke . " Jack smiled his agreement with Blair 's assessment . Blair stirred some papers around on the glass surface of his desk . " We need your Social Security number . " Jack reached for his wallet . " I thought you 'd never ask . Continues ...
