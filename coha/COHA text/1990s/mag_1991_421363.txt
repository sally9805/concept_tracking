Section : HOT SPOTS Jamaica 's Joshua squirms in the teeth of twin lions of the nineties : drug lords and the IMF . <p> A HELICOPTER DESCENDS JUST OUTSIDE OF MAY Pen , a town west of Kingston . Fifty people wave , jump , and dance as Michael Manley , Jamaica 's prime minister , arrives to stump for municipal candidates of his People 's National Party ( PNP ) . Manley braces for the crowd , and one of his police bodyguards grabs the back of his belt so that loyal enthusiasts will not inadvertently knock down their six-foot-three , two-hundred-pound leader . <p> " Hail , Big Daddy ! " a lean , muscular man shouts . " Respect ! " a Rastafarian cheers . The members of the prime minister 's entourage , including the local police commander , ignore the odor of smoking ganja , which someone in the crowd is enjoying . " Love you , Joshua , " a middle-aged woman cries , using the name bestowed on Manley by the Jamaican poor-a reference to the biblical Joshua , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For Manley , the scene has become routine in nearly twenty years of whistle-stopping , ever since he first won the office of prime minister in 1972 . For us , the familiar spectacle of people reaching out brought back memories of being with him in 1976 , when we worked on his successful re-election effort , and of returning to Jamaica in 1980 , to witness his crushing defeat . <p> We believed then that Manley 's political leadership symbolized the search for democracy and civilized socialism . " Comrades , we , the Jamaican people , are trapped in a world system that we call imperialism , and we are trapped in a local system that we call capitalism , " Manley told a crowd of poor farmers during the 1976 campaign . " We realized that there could be no change unless we were prepared to replace the capitalist system with the socialist system . " <p> But by the spring of 1990 , though the crowds cheer him enthusiastically , Joshua does not raise his trumpet . In six campaign stops , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several interviews , his private message matches his public one , sober and subdued . " The world has changed . Jamaica has changed . And I think I have changed , " Manley tells us quietly . " My goals are the same , but there is no easy path for the Third World today . " <p> Much of the Third World , of course , is in desperate straits . The most populous part of the world received a smaller proportion of global resources in 1990 than it did thirty years ago . But while international attention is fixed narrowly on conflict in the Middle East , the spin-off effects of dramatic geopolitical changes on the countries of the South are largely ignored . What happened to the international struggle against imperialism of the 1960s and 1970s can clearly be traced in Michael Manley 's Jamaica . <p> As prime minister , Manley embodied the ideas of the Third World movement for independence from the centuries-old tyranny of empire . But in 1980 , Manley and the PNP were subjected to a humiliating electoral defeat , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn Jamaica into an experimental laboratory for free-market speculators . When the balloon of supply-side euphoria collapsed , and its proponents had no more hot air  --  or capital  --  with which to inflate it , Manley won reelection in 1989 . <p> Now Manley struggles to provide leadership under new conditions . The Jamaican economy , like that of most of its Caribbean neighbors , is in tatters . Manley 's own health is failing ( he has recently recovered from pneumonia and surgery for prostate cancer ) . His dilemma as a visionary and pragmatic leader sets a tableau of Third World reality for the foreseeable future . As a Jamaican street philosopher phrased it , " Dread now , maybe worse soon come . " <p> " As LONG AS I 'M PARTY LEADER , I CAN promise you that we will walk through this world on our feet and not on our knees . Everyone is so worried about us vexing the Americans . We are not vexing the Americans . They are vexing themselves . " That was Michael Manley campaigning for re , election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought blacks into the previously restricted circles of power , constructed housing and medical clinics for the poor , launched a literacy project , and started a modest agrarian reform program , which distributed tiny plots , eased credit for farmers , and built feeder roads . <p> To pay for needed reforms , Manley placed a tax on the products of the U.S.-owned bauxite companies . His strategy for achieving an independent Jamaica also brought him to the forefront of the nonaligned movement and into an alliance with Cuba 's Fidel Castro . Those policies indeed caused the national security elite of the United States to " vex themselves . " <p> Manley was to learn a painful lesson . Aid , credit , and loans to Jamaica slowed to a trickle , and assorted destabilization tactics surfaced from 1976 to 1980 , including the outbreak of daily and deadly street violence . Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , vacationing at the Rockefeller estate in Jamaica , personally assured Manley after Christmas in 1976 that the CIA was not involved in destabilizing his government . " At that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being targeted . " <p> In addition to bearing the brunt of U.S. pressure , Jamaica had to face a broader global burden : rocketing oil prices and a collapse in sugar and other commodity prices . These factors forced Jamaica and much of the Third World to seek bank loans and arrangements with the International Monetary Fund , which , in turn , required from the borrowing governments austerity measures that proved to be anathema to progressive reforms . By the time Manley called elections , in the fall of 1980 , he had broken with the IMF , but the treasury and store shelves of Jamaica were empty . <p> " Seaga a bad man , " a prescient Rastafarian told us just before the election . " Joshua a lion . But not even Joshua can fight the mother . No man , you do n't fuck with the mother . " Just days after Edward Seaga , a U.S.-backed financier representing the rival Jamaican Labor Party , won the prime ministership , a well-known free marketer also won the presidency of the United States . <p> EDWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Ronald Reagan 's White House . He charmed a luncheon audience of five hundred government and business leaders with a story about an arthritic centipede seeking medical advice from a stork . " Get rid of all but two of your legs and you 'll improve by 98 percent , " the stork recommends . " How do I do this ? " the centipede inquires . " Oh , that 's policy , " the stork replies . <p> Jamaica was an " economically and politically arthritic centipede " seeking the remedy to its malady , Seaga informed the elite diners . President Reagan , amused by the story , turned grinning to Secretary of State Al Haig and said , " Al , he 's one of us . " <p> Reagan was fight . Seaga , following the stork 's counsel , set out to cut the legs from the previous Jamaican government 's reform programs . He reduced spending on education , health , and housing , dismantled sugar workers ' cooperatives , and lifted import controls . In foreign policy , he showed Reagan complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional support for the U.S. invasion of Grenada . He also sent home the Cuban ambassador and cut ties with Castro . <p> Seaga 's courtship of foreign capital brought what looked like a plum : David Rockefeller agreed to chair a committee of U.S. business leaders to explore investment opportunities in Jamaica . " Free-enterprise Jamaica , not Marxist Cuba , should serve as a model for Central America in the struggle to overcome poverty and move towards democracy , " a pleased Ronald Reagan announced . <p> From 1980 to 1985 , Jamaica received $617.4 million , more U.S. aid per capita than any country but Israel . President Reagan 's development inspiration  --  the Caribbean Basin Initiative  --  was a Seaga idea that gained Jamaica preferential access to the U.S. market . The IMF and other multilateral lending institutions that had been placing onerous conditions on borrowing during Manley 's rule turned Jamaica into the world 's highest per capita recipient of loans , as well . <p> Despite this massive injection of money , Seaga ran aground . Debt doubled while productivity declined . And the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Seaga 's tenure drew to a close , the Jamaican economy was producing less per capita than it had been ten years earlier under Manley . Unemployment had risen to an official rate of 25 percent . The free-market experiment had clearly failed . Seaga 's rightwing former U.S. admirers explained the failure away by accusing Seaga of betraying their trust by not going far enough in cutting state spending on the poor . <p> " Seaga assumed that because the president of the United States supported him , and he was saying the right things , that we would get a sudden , massive inflow of foreign private investment capital , " Manley says . " But the U.S. private sector does not go even where its beloved president tells it to go . It invests for reasons that have to do with strategic necessity , calculations on security and continuity .... " <p> Seaga campaigned in 1989 on the slogan WE ARE THE CHANGE , which he lifted from the Republican party convention the previous year . But after eight years of hard times , despite the enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw popular support . And Manley tromped Seaga 's forces in a roughly sixty-forty victory , approximately the margin by which Seaga had gained the prime ministership nine years earlier . <p> As PRIME MINISTER , MANLEY CONFRONTS A staggering drug problem . Jamaica is an island of small merchants , and drugs have become an integral part of the informal economy . For visitors , the peddlers are inescapable , as we discover one morning , lounging on a pier at Ocho Rios . <p> A Rasta man , two upper and lower teeth showing amid his gums , waves from a rickety outboard-motor boat . " You wan ' some nice fresh fish ? " he inquires , holding up a specimen . <p> " No . " The boat approaches . <p> " You lek a ride on de boat ? " Again we decline . Dilly Ban , now two feet from the pier , gives us an intimate look . Then his smile turns into a serious expression . " You want some Indica ? Make you high . " " No thanks . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hundred U.S. , but I can make a special deal . For you , eighty dollars . " <p> The boat begins to pull away . " You like some crack ? " We shake our heads no , and Dilly Ban heads for the next pier to offer personal drug , fish , and sight-seeing services to tourists . <p> There are Dilly Bans all over the Third World , making a precarious living from peddling whatever the tourists will buy . But every year , there is less room in the global economy for these hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men and women . Dilly Ban can not return to the land , for there is precious little available-and if he did so , he would almost certainly find himself dropping ganja seeds into the earth . <p> In late 1989 , the Jamaica Defense Force ( JDF ) , with the support and encouragement of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency , carried out a raid at Ginger Ridge in St. Catherine 's Parish , destroying the local ganja crop . The local growers complained to their member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their wives , children , and relatives all participated in the planting , weeding , harvesting , cleaning , and packing of the " herb . " <p> Because the government has not maintained the roads , farmers can not get other , more perishable and less profitable , crops to market before they spoil . Indeed , the farmers have pointed out that the raid itself had to be carried out by paratroopers because the roads were impassable . The government had neither money to repair roads nor capital to put up a factory to produce tinned akee or cocoa . So when the soldiers left , the farmers replanted . <p> Manley understands the Ginger Ridge ganja farmers and the thousands of Dilly Bans who populate the tourist areas ; he also knows about " the gold-chain boys , " who get rich selling crack in the steaming streets of Trenchtown and other poor neighborhoods . Though he must cooperate with the U.S. drug bureaucracy in order to receive U.S. aid , he knows that demand in the United States will not drop off as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts have done little to touch the insidious spread of crack in the Kingston ghettos , where , as in the U.S. inner cities , a crack high is as close as the user can get to consumer paradise . <p> " POVERTY IS THE FINAL AFFRONT THAT must be abolished , " Manley says , citing President John E Kennedy 's similar line on the subject . " I have n't changed my politics . Good medical care , education , housing  --  getting these things turned out to be a lot harder than we believed in the 1970s . To learn from and admit mistakes is a signpost of wisdom . " <p> One mistake he will not repeat is confronting the United States and the International Monetary Fund . Manley has also distanced himself from Cuban president Fidel Castro , a former friend and confidant . In retrospect , Manley says , the path that he pursued provoked unnecessary conflict with powerful enemies , but without the resources to do battle . A strategist to the core , he " would be less confrontational , " he reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s . <p> This more pliant posture became dramatically clear in 1990 , when Manley welcomed Vice-President Dan Quayle to Jamaica after the U.S. invasion of Panama . Even though Manley disagreed with the U.S. military moves and refused to recognize Washington 's designated new president of Panama , having Quayle as a guest signified a new approach to Washington . And it paid off : Quayle helped Manley restore some of the antidrug funds that the State Department had rerouted from Jamaica to Eastern Europe . <p> Manley remains proud of the PNP 's achievements during the 1970s . His current administration intends to hang on to what is left of those gains . " We sowed the seeds of social revolution , " he says . " We altered class relations . Household helpers now enter by the front door , and poor Jamaicans have an unconscious reflex assumption about their rights . The poor used to say , Do I have rights ? ' Now they know they do , and he who has rights forgets the time when he did n't have them . " <p> WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations in the South as control of resources and capital becomes ever more concentrated in corporate and bank boardrooms in Tokyo , New York , and European cities ? Manley , who in the 1980s educated audiences about the dangers of IMF formulas , now clenches his fists under the table as he negotiates with the IMF , while 50 cents of every export dollar goes to service the country 's debt . " If you are in desperate need of money and there is only one banker in town , " Manley instructs a trade union audience in Kingston , " you can argue with the banker , but you can not quarrel with him . " <p> Manley once inspired millions with a vision of a new economic order . Now he must operate at the margins of world power , scrambling to react to external shocks that jolt Jamaica 's fragile economy . The Persian Gulf crisis sends Jamaica reeling from the escalating price of imported oil . Recession in the United States means shrinking markets and declining investment . Eastern Europe 's turn to the West leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jamaica is representative of small and medium-sized poor countries around the world . Privatization and austerity have become watchwords , not choice-because there is no choice . <p> When we press Manley about his strategy for economic development , he speaks about his hope that Jamaica could become a hightech data-processing center or a chic tourist attraction , the Taiwan or Hawaii of the Caribbean . Noting our skepticism , he asks : " Or do you think we can get Bush and the other leaders of the North to listen to reason ? That seems to be the only option we have . " <p> Manley became a Third World hero by drawing the line on U.S. influence in Jamaica , without getting Soviet backing . He now acknowledges that his country 's future and by implication most of the Third World's-relies on faith in the understanding , if not charity , of western leaders . <p> We have known Manley for fifteen years . In the 1970s , he put forth alluring , innovative ideas . Today , he stands as a different kind of symbol . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a pity that the times do not permit the hero to exercise his power .
