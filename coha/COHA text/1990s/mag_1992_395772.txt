HOW DEEP DO YOUR FAVORITE fishing lures run when trolled or retrieved at normal speeds ? How do you know which lure will level off at the depth you want to reach ? Will the lure run deeper if you move it faster or lower your rod tip ? Questions like these have troubled anglers since the introduction of artificial plugs . No one has ever had the definitive answer ... no one , that is , until Mike McClelland figured it all out last year . McClelland is well-known as the nation 's leading walleye tournament winner , but the information his research team compiled while testing 200 crankbaits is of inestimable value to all fishermen who use artificial lures . Using two boats  --  one to troll lures and one to follow them with a pair of Eagle Mach 1 Chart Depth Recorders  --  McClelland and his research crew tested each of the 200 lures at standard trolling and casting distances . From the raw data they produced charts that tell the maximum depth each lure will reach , depending on the diameter of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise depth at which each lure runs when fished at various distances on different weight monofilament lines . McClelland 's findings are full of surprises . His provable depth figures caused some major lure manufacturers to modify their advertising claims ; some " deep running " lures proved not to go as deep as expected . But most important , while making the tests McClelland and his crew also turned up a lot of new information on how crankbaits can be used more effectively . TROLLING CRANKBAITS SURPRISINGLY , MCCLELLAND DETERmined that line diameter , not trolling speed , governs the maximum depth a lure will reach . When trolled at speeds of 1 to 4 miles per hour , the lures did not vary their depth . At less than 1 mile per hour , all lures tended to rise , and at speeds above 4 miles per hour , they also rose because of increased friction and resistance as the line passed through the water . Line diameter , however , had considerable influence on how deep the lures would run . As line diameter increased , resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , a change from 8-pound-test monofilament to 14-pound-test mono would reduce any lure 's maximum depth by 3 feet when trolled 120 feet behind the boat . ( During these tests color-coded Crankbait'n line from Wille Products was used to establish line diameter standards . ) According to the tests , the maximum depth lures will reach is controlled by the design of the lure , the length of line from the rod tip , and the line diameter . Lures that have the line attachment on the lip , rather than the nose , dive deeper . Those with the largest lip surface areas dive deepest of all . " There 's a big difference between fishing and going fishing , " McClelland notes . " Dragging a lure around randomly , hoping a fish will hit , that 's going fishing . You 're not really fishing until you put an attractive lure right where the fish are . " For a moderate price , today 's fishermen have a wide array of electronic equipment available to record the depth of the water , the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over . But unless you know which line-lure combinations will reach the level at which the fish are holding , all that information is worthless . During McClelland 's study , the researchers gathered solid indications that suspended fish often will rise to take baits that pass overhead , but will not go down for lures that pass beneath them . In the course of the survey , the recording graphs showed forty-five fish rising to hit lures as they passed above them , yet no recorded fish reacted to lures that passed underneath . Since the lures were running directly below the recording boat , fish that struck the lures showed clearly on the recording graph , and the strikes could be analyzed later . Though lures with all types of actions were tested at depths ranging to 41 feet , thirty-five of the forty-five fish that struck during the tests hit lures which rattled . " It convinced me that lures with BBs sealed inside really do attract more fish , " McClelland said . " Rattling lures are not just gimmicks . " Perhaps the most startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With 120 feet of 8-to 12-pound-test line out , the person holding the rod was unable to hook any of the fish that struck . On several occasions the recording boat graphed fish that carried the lure completely out of the cone of view of the chart recorder , yet these strikes went unnoticed by the person holding the rod . When 120 feet of 17-pound-test line was used , however , all strikes recorded were detected by the person holding the rod . All of the fish landed during the testing were caught on 17-pound-test line . " The tests make it very clear that fishermen miss a lot of strikes when trolling long lengths of light line , " McClelland noted . Because of the tremendous stretch of monofilament line , you should use heavier line and extremely sharp hooks for trolling . CASTING CRANKBAITS TO GATHER ACCURATE INFORMATION about how crankbaits behave when being cast and retrieved , McClelland and his crew used a submerged pole marked in 1-foot increments and an underwater camera to record the maximum depth each lure attains when retrieved at 100 cranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear ratios available on today 's standard spinning reels . Although lure design and weight dictated how far each lure could be cast , the tests showed that all lures reach their maximum depth mid-way through their maximum casting distance . As a general rule , the researchers also found that when cast its maximum distance , a lure will attain only half the depth it reaches when trolled . How far each lure can be cast is determined by the design and weight of the lure and the weight of the line being used , but it was proven that all lures run deepest when their maximum casting distances are reached . You lose 1 foot of depth for each 10 feet short of its maximum limit your casts reaches . During the course of testing , the researchers cast each of the 200 lures five times on three different style reels . The overall average casting distance was 71 feet , and the longest cast was 136 feet ( with a Rat-L-Trap ) . Line diameter also proved to be an important factor in both the distance a lure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lure depth decreases by approximately 1 foot for each line-size increase , and casting distance also decreases as heavier lines are used . The researchers found that when cast , lures take 20 to 35 percent of the distance to reach their maximum depth once the retrieve begins . An equal distance is used when the lures are angled back up to the rod tip at the end of the retrieve . Fishermen can lengthen the distance at which the lure remains at maximum depth by holding the rod tip low at the end of the retrieve . The " kneel and reel " technique in which the fisherman kneels and plunges the length of his fishing rod underwater during the retrieve really does further extend the distance the lure will run at maximum depth . " Raising or lowering the rod tip does not affect how deep the lure will go , but the rod tip level does determine how long the lure will stay at its maximum depth , " McClelland explained . For bait-casting , 100 cranks per minute is an average comfortable cranking speed . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolutions per minute is dictated by the gear ratio of the reel being used . For the tests McClelland and his crew used reels with three popular gear ratios . At 100 cranks per minute , reels with 3.8:1 ratio moved the lures at 1.6 to 1.7 miles per hour ; reels with 5.2:1 gear ratio moved them at 2.1 to 2.2 miles per hour ; and reels with gear ratios of 6.2:1 moved them at 2.6 to 2.7 miles per hour . They found that deep-running lures reached their maximum depth quickest when retrieved at the slow rate provided by the 3.8:1 reel , and that all deep-running lures ran shallower when retrieved faster . Increasing cranking speed made all of the tested lures run shallower , never deeper . The 5.2:1 gear ratio of the medium-speed reel provided the most versatility , since it allowed the researchers to make the widest variety of lures operate with full action at the greatest range of depths by simply adjusting cranking speed . Reels with the fast 6.2:1 ratio are designed to burn a bait through the water at maximum speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are retrieved at more than 100 cranks per minute , the higher speed is ideal for lures that imitate fleeing minnows and have a tight wobbling action . Sweeping the rod 4 to 6 feet forward when retrieving or trolling causes lures to rise 18 to 24 inches . However , if the trolling or retrieving speed remains constant , within 10 seconds all lures returned to their maximum depth regardless of whether or not the rod was dropped back into its original position . The angle at which a fishing rod is held proved to have no effect on how deep lures run . On maximum distance casts , the researchers tested the effects of retrieving with the rod held in three positions : high overhead , with the rod tip at the water 's surface , and with the rod submerged full length underwater . The lure depths were totally unaffected by the changing rod angles ; lures passed the measuring pole at the same depth regardless of how the rod was held so long as constant speed was maintained . The researchers found that rod tip height does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lying on the water . However , whenever line lies on the water , all lures seek their own levels and rod angle has no effect . " Matching lure depth to the level where fish are holding is more important than the color , shape , or action of the lure , " says McClelland . " You can adjust that depth by changing the line length or the line weight or by changing lures , but in order to catch fish consistently you have to keep your lure in the strike zone . " ROLLERS AND WOBBLERS * Crankbaits fall into two basic categories : rollers and wobblers . Rollers are generally shallow-running and have the line attachment at the nose rather than the tip . The researchers found that rollers require slightly more speed to achieve maximum side-to-side rolling action , though the change in speed does not affect the lure 's maximum depth . Wobblers are deep-running lures with the line attachment on the lip . They zigzag through the water on a wider side-to-side course regardless of the depth at which they are moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRANKBAIT CALCULATOR McClelland 's research led to the development of a simple dial calculator that allows you to determine the depth at which any of the 200 study lures will run , depending on line weight and length . Just match an arrow to the maximum depth the chart shows a lure will reach on the line weight you choose and numbers appearing in a window tell exactly how deep the lure will run when trolled at normal speeds  --  30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , and 120 feet behind the boat . ( Chart omitted ) With this knowledge at your fingertips , you can see which lure-line combinations will enable you to fish at any depth down to 40 feet without requiring any complicated additional equipment .
