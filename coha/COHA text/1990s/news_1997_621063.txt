<p> CENTRAL FREEWAY PLAN LEADS TO GRIDLOCK <p> Editor  --  It is very disappointing to see The Chronicle endorse Supervisor Yaki 's " cut-the-baby- in-half " compromise plan to end the Central Freeway at Haight Street ( Editorial , July 9 ) . Haight is ill-suited for such a terminus  --  it is narrow and has several regular bus lines congesting its traffic . U.S. 101 would become one long parking lot emanating from a nightmare Haight stoplight . <p> Fell and Oak streets , where the freeway should continue to connect , are four lanes of timed lights in each direction . <p> A more insightful editorial might have questioned why a major metropolis , in the midst of increasing its traffic by building new ballparks and expanding its downtown , would consider interrupting a vital transportation artery used by tens of thousands solely to placate the wishes of a few dissatisfied neighbors . Residents of Hayes Valley , doubtless of their own free will , moved next to the 40-year-old Central ; now , damning the road as the source of all their misfortunes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bay Bridge . <p> SCOTT ZELLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> IMMIGRANTS A BENEFIT <p> Editor  --  The July 9 letter , " Costly Immigrants , " by Raymond Batz , grossly misrepresents the findings of the recent National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) report on immigration . His misrepresentation flies in the face of the study 's conclusion : " Immigration benefits the U.S. economy overall and has little negative effect on the income and job opportunities of most native-born Americans . " <p> Mr. Batz selectively cites statistics on the annual cost of immigrant-headed households to the California economy while failing to mention that those figures include the costs of schooling immigrant children , but do not count the taxes paid by working children of immigrants . That 's why the NAS report states , " Annual estimates of immigrants ' impact on state and local taxpayers . . . should not be used to predict the long-term costs of admitting new immigrants . " <p> In answer to the real question , " What is the fiscal impact of admitting new immigrants to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net fiscal benefit to natives of admitting a new immigrant is +$ 80,000 . The NAS study confirms what history has already shown us , namely that immigrants build America and make us richer . <p> T. J. RODGERS <p> President &; CEO <p> Cypress Semiconductor Corp . <p> San Jose <p> . <p> SPEAKER RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  Your July 11 editorial on secondhand smoke , in which you wrongly tar me as manipulating an Assembly committee vote to help tobacco companies , is in error . <p> Your editorial suggests I appointed Assemblyman Martin Gallegos to the Labor Committee so he would vote against a bill to ban smoking in bars and casinos . I appointed Assemblyman Gallegos , who is also chair of the Assembly Health Committee , to replace a Labor Committee member who had resigned after objecting that the chair of the committee had mad a racially insensitive remark . Assemblyman Gallegos has supported two different bills  --  mine and Senator Kopp 's  --  that increase the potential for lawsuits against tobacco companies . <p> Your editorial quotes one  --  unnamed  --  lawmaker as saying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you allege is an ongoing effort to help tobacco companies . Clear away the smoke , and dozens of other lawmakers  --  who would allow the use of their names  --  will tell you that the only reason the California attorney general has moved forward in pursuing lawsuits against tobacco companies is because of the urgency legislation I carried . <p> Finally , while it might provide a fix for the political junkies on your staff , viewing my actions through the prism of my predecessor is a disservice to your readers . If The Chronicle wants to cover Willie Brown , you know where to find him . If you want to cover the Assembly that exists today , I will be happy to work with you . <p> CRUZ M. BUSTAMANTE <p> Speaker of the Assembly <p> . <p> AN ECO-FANTASY <p> Editor  --  Re : the July 10 front- page article , " An Eco-Friendly S.F. " This proposal is outrageous . In a city that can not keep its streets clean , has no idea how to operate its public transportation system , and simply can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of personal preference , with no hope of any substantial change , beyond proposed tax increases . <p> Three years in the making , with 400 people contributing , and this fantasy is the result ? From any angle , this proposal is wasteful , arrogant and counterproductive . The city will now decide who can drive , as well as where and when ? The city will decide who will be allowed to live here , as well as what we will be allowed to wear , eat and presumably think ? <p> This story sounds like it may have originated in Berkeley . San Francisco , before Mayor Brown , was at least thought of as a major metropolitan area . This ludicrous concoction will only add to San Francisco 's new reputation , in the Jack Davis party mold . <p> JIM KIRWAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A GREEN INQUISITION <p> Editor  --  The front-page news of a master plan for San Francisco  --  the Eco-City  --  was delightful . Although the article was indeed an authentic report on a plan which would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . <p> I can just picture San Francisco sending teams to Iran to learn the intricacies of busybody activities . After all , we 're going to need Armpit Police to ensure that people not use offensive deodorants . Special search warrants will enable newly-trained House Police to nose into apartments where incense is burned . <p> Read your history , folks . It happened in Spain . There will be pockets of citizens pretending to be eco-perfect , but who will gather at night underground to smoke , eat meat , drink spirits and do other things too disgusting to put in print . Never fear , a new inquisition will hunt them down , and , eventually , we shall have a totally Green San Francisco . The air will be clean , the trees will be beautiful , the birds will sing and Heaven will be here on Earth ! It 's up to the supervisors to legislate appropriately . <p> FLETCHER PHELAN <p> Larkspur <p> . <p> STRAIGHT PRIDE DAYS <p> Editor  --  I found Jennifer Willhite 's July 8 letter about the Gay Pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I asked my mom why , since there 's Mother 's Day and Father 's Day , there is n't a Kids ' Day . She responded that every day is Kids ' Day . It 's the same with straight people . <p> Willhite and the others like her who have problems with gay pride celebrations need to remember that every other day of the year is Straight Pride Day . <p> Let 's remember that gays and lesbians celebrate sexuality and their bodies precisely because they were forbidden to for hundreds of years by the oppressive world around them . Fifty years from now , when gay Americans really are treated just like straight Americans , they wo n't need gay pride parades anymore . Meanwhile , give them a break . <p> SCOTT MILLER <p> St. Louis <p> . <p> KILLING TO BE THIN <p> Editor  --  I am so tired of the public outpour of emotions shocked from learning that a professional female performer has succumbed to an eating disorder . <p> Why is it " OK " for a woman to be malnourished because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's never " OK . " <p> The general public uniformly admires and applauds the aesthetics of being thin . We kill ourselves to reach a magic number on a scale that measures more than just body weight , but , unfortunately , success , self-esteem and self-worth . In the struggle for the " perfect body , " too many times we lose ourselves and sometimes , tragically , our lives . When and where will it end ? <p> ROBYN CHELSEA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BOMB GROUP REUNION <p> Editor  --  All former members of the 379th Bomb Group who served with the 8th Army Air Force in Kimbolton , England , in World War II from 1943 to mid- 1945 are asked to join us at a reunion to be held in Savannah , Ga. , September 19-23 .
