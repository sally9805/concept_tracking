On Jan. 22 , 1991 , Pope John Paul II confirmed the judgment of the committees of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints that John Henry Newman ( 1801-90 ) had indeed practiced the theological and moral virtues " to a heroic degree . " That judgment was based on the second volume of what is called Positio super Virtutibus , a documentary presentation of the evidence for Newman 's holiness that I drew from the materials collected by the Historical Commission appointed by the Archbishop of Birmingham to investigate Newman 's life , virtues and reputation for holiness . ( See my article " Prelude to the Making of a Saint , " America 3/11/89 . ) In less technical terms , the declaration of the " heroicity of the virtues " means that it has been established by the canons of historical and theological research that Newman was more than ordinarily holy . He is therefore entitled to be called " Venerable " and is a fit candidate for beatification and canonization . The well-known personal interest the Pope has taken in Newman 's cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the centenary of Newman 's death raised expectations that John Paul II would move quickly to beatify the great 19th-century English cardinal . The Pope has not yet done so , however , and so people are asking : " Where stands the cause of Newman ? " The answer is that the requirements that call for one miracle for beatification and one more for canonization are still in effect . Though some cures have been attributed to Newman 's intercession , none so far has been able to meet the stringent requirements of the Congregation . Consequently , I have issued an appeal for an organized and concentrated effort to secure the necessary miracle . The English bishops have agreed to set aside Newman 's birthday , Feb. 21 , as an annual day of prayer for this intention . Volunteers in parishes , with the approval of the local pastor , will keep the pamphlet racks supplied with prayer cards and materials relevant to the cause . They will also urge sick persons , especially those judged incurable , to pray through the intercession of Newman . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended to other countries . From long experience , the Congregation has instructed postulators to make sure that the officially approved prayer for canonization is used in these circumstances . Copies of that prayer , as well as other items about the cause , can easily be obtained from the Newman Secretariat at the Oratory , Hagley Rd. , Birmingham 816 BUE , England . Some have questioned the necessity of the requirement of physical miracles . They argue that miracles do not seem absolutely essential to the process of canonization . Even in his own lifetime , Newman recognized that establishing the holiness of a Servant of God is primary . Miracles come only later . This judgment seems historically correct . The emphasis on miracles dates from the Middle Ages , when a saint was looked upon as a wonder-worker . Pope John Paul II has , in fact , lessened the number of miracles required and in some cases has dispensed from them . He has , however , restricted these concessions to the causes of martyrs . Nowadays it is becoming more and more difficult to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge a cure to be miraculous , but only to provide the original and subsequent diagnoses and to state what medical explanation , if any , can be given for the change . Still , doctors are reluctant to become involved in the process of investigation . This is understandable on the part of agnostic doctors , but some Catholic doctors , fearful of the reaction of their non-Catholic colleagues , also decline to take part . Even within the Congregation itself there are some who would like to see the requirement of a miracle dropped . Perhaps the strongest argument for retaining it is that the judgment on the heroicity of the virtues is after all a human judgment ; it could conceivably be mistaken . The miracle is regarded , therefore , as a sign of God 's endorsement of the human judgment . It can be asked , however , if a moral miracle would not serve this purpose just as well as a physical one . In Newman 's case the evidence of a moral miracle is exceptionally strong . The Historical Commissioners who conducted the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted almost 200 firsthand testimonies to Newman 's spiritual influence and affirmed before the diocesan tribunal that in their judgment this influence constituted a moral miracle . In fact , the Commission could have submitted many more such testimonies , but it judged the actual selection large enough to assure a cumulative proof of the universal acknowledgment of Newman 's effect . Some of these testimonies began with the statement , " I , like thousands of others , "  --  a reference to the well-known and widespread spiritual influence of Newman 's published volumes of Parochial and Plain Sermons . These witnesses were persons of all shades of religious opinion . Newman 's spiritual influence did not cease at his death . An article in the Times of London on Feb. 3 , 1990 , began this way : " There is probably only one Victorian Englishman for whom it may be safely said that his influence has even now not reached its peak . " It is remarkable that each year persons are received into the Catholic Church as a result of reading Newman 's works , particularly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to digest without some historical knowledge of the circumstances and religious controversies to which it refers . A Catholic priest told me that he had been serene in his Anglican beliefs until he read Newman 's novel , Loss and Gain : The Story of a Convert , which convinced him he had to enter the Catholic Church . I suppose , however , that the most influential of Newman 's works remain the Parochial and Plain Sermons ( eight volumes , available in one published by the Ignatius Press , San Francisco ) . When one considers that there is no systematic and comprehensive treatment of Newman 's spirituality , though individual elements have been noted , it is unusual that so many persons in an age not given to sermon reading have come to know Newman through these sermons . The present writer will publish shortly , under St. Bede 's Publications imprint , The White Stone : The Spiritual Theology of John Henry Newman . It is hoped that this work will introduce Newman to many more readers . The latter are increasing year by year . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Newman 's Meditations and Devotions was published by the Newman Secretariat . It contains a Newman prayer for each day of the month . Though the book was not advertised , information about it soon spread by word of mouth and to date more than 30,000 copies have been requested . Senator Cossiga , a former president of the Italian Republic , carries it around in his pocket and has had it translated into Italian . Spanish and Catalan translations are in print , and French and German ones will be forthcoming . It is not only from his books that Newman 's spiritual influence radiates . That influence is greatest among those who have a limited knowledge of his writings but have been touched by his holiness of life . They see in him a man of great talent and ability combined with a deep humility and modesty , a man who worked tirelessly for the welfare of both the Church of England and the Catholic Church , though he himself was unappreciated at times by the authorities in both communions . Here was a man who committed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of God , or what was then called " the invisible world . " He comes across as a person of rare empathy and understanding , capable of entering into the views and feelings of all sorts of people whether he agreed with them or not , especially those in anxiety or doubt . His admirers see in him a man of great sincerity whose honesty in the search for truth brought him mental and emotional suffering , a man who sacrificed position , prestige and influence and was ostracized by his relatives and friends when he followed his conscience in entering the Catholic Church . They also see in him one like themselves , subject to trials and hardships , but always submitting his own will to God 's and never losing the trust and confidence that God 's providence was mysteriously guiding his life . Newman was convinced that personal influence was the chief instrument of spreading truth . In one of his university sermons he said that truth has been upheld " not as a system , not by books , not by argument , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once the teachers and the patterns of it . " Of the qualities that make for such influence , the first is holiness : " The attraction , exerted by unconscious holiness , is of an urgent and irresistible nature . " He cited the example of St. Athanasius " who impressed an image on the church , which ... shall not be effaced while time lasts . " Many years ago , when I first read the statement of the theologian and philosopher Eric Przywara that Newman was the St. Augustine of the modern world , I thought it an exaggeration . Since then I have discovered a number of sober scholars who have said the same or something similar  --  what St. Augustine was to the early church and St. Thomas Aquinas to the Middle Ages , Newman is to the modem church . Given Newman 's influence on the Second Vatican Council , sometimes referred to as Newman 's Council , this may well eventually prove true . Pope Paul VI , one year before his death , whispered into the ear of Jean Guitton : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor of the church . " This would , however , require that first he be canonized . Because the heroicity of Newman 's virtues has been established , I feel confident that Newman will be canonized , but until then the assertion of the editorial in the London Times the day after Newman 's death still seems valid : " Of one thing we may be sure , that the memory of his pure and noble life , untouched by worldliness , unsoured by any trace of fanaticism , will endure , and that whether Rome canonizes him or not he will be canonized in the thoughts of pious people of many creeds in England . " It seems certain too that like the ripples produced by a stone dropped into a pond , Newman 's influence will continue to spread in ever-widening circles . Still , one hopes and prays that the beatification and canonization will not be too long in coming , as they would bring joy to , literally and without exaggeration ( as I can attest ) , thousands of persons throughout the entire world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of English at Fordham University , Bronx , N.Y. , is postulator of the cause for the canonization of Cardinal John Henry Newman . <p>                     @x Proving you 're worthy of a low loan rate or a new credit card is n't easy in today 's lending world .
