In the pre-show line for the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man , visitors to Universal 's Islands of Adventure learn that the Sinister Syndicate has hijacked the Statue of Liberty . Who can save her , and give the customers a six-minute jolt that will be worth every bit of the $42 they 've paid for a day at Orlando 's newest theme park ? Only Peter Parker , a.k.a . Spider-Man . <P> On this stunning , pummeling ride , visitors are strapped into a " scoop " ( cab ) that twists and lurches in the dark while 3-D images of destruction explode from 25 large movie screens to the accompaniment of cunning fire and water effects . Spider-Man jumps onto the hood of the scoop , Doctor Octopus shakes it like a gorilla with a new toy , Hobgoblin tosses flaming pumpkins , Electro makes malefic use of a giant socket plug , Hydro Man spritzes everyone , and the scoop plummets what feels like hundreds of feet from the sky into concrete canyons that suddenly seem grand  --  Grand Guignol , that is . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out-of-mind experience reduces cynical theme parkers to burbling kids . " Gee , " they say as they stagger out , " that was the best ride  --  ever ! " And the Universal bosses raise their fists in an unspoken " Gotcha , Disney ! " <P> Ask children at a northern airport where they 're heading , and they do n't say Orlando ; they say , with an almost desperate glow , " Disney . " Walt and his successors turned Central Florida swampland into the country 's top resort destination and , for decades , have virtually monopolized it . Now Edgar Bronfman 's besieged company has spent five years and $2.5 billion ( on top of a previous billion or so for its Universal Studios Florida , or U.S.F. , park , which opened in 1990 ) to get Orlando-bound kids to think " Universal . " Though visitors have been filtering in since March , this week marks the official opening of Islands of Adventure , or I.O.A. , and an adjacent area , City Walk , with shops , restaurants and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escape , has enlisted Steven Spielberg as a creative consultant . <P> Even these days , $2.5 billion is a lot of dough to invest in rides and restaurants . For that money , you could finance 12 whole Titanics or 14 Waterworlds . What it gets Universal , in addition to I.O.A. and City Walk , is three lavish hotels , the first of which , Portofino Bay , opens in September . The plan is to challenge Walt Disney World as a full-service resort  --  a place where people can spend all their time and money . <P> Disney wants to hook the whole family with its homey , homogenized grandeur ; U.S.F. and I.O.A. are aimed at the 9- to 15-year-olds , too hip for the Magic Kingdom but still young enough to tolerate a week 's vacation with their parents . As consumers , these kids are warier . So the coasters are scarier , the flume rides hairier . Even I.O.A. 's Cat in the Hat ride , tailored for kids , may upset some young stomachs with its gyrations . Disney soothes , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal rattles and rocks ; it is Bart Simpson baby-sitting Maggie .
