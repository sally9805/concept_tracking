At first , the story seemed too horrifying to believe . Upset that her mother was dying ( reportedly of AIDS ) , 6-year-old Jackie Johnson of Dania , Fla. , stepped in front of a speeding train on June 15 and was killed . Jackie , who with her four siblings had been staying with a cousin , told her brother and sister that she wanted to " be with the angels " before walking onto the tracks ; relatives speculated that the kindergartner ended her life in order to be in heaven with her mother when she died . AIDS , it sadly seemed , had claimed another victim . In its second decade , the disease has found no shortage of lives to ruin in the U.S. ( Since the late 1970s , AIDS has claimed 182,275 lives ; 107,045 people currently have the disease . ) Once confined primarily to men in high-risk groups , AIDS is now spreading fastest among women of childbearing age . ( In New York City AIDS is the No. 1 killer of women between 15 and 44 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left parentless . " In seven short years we will have 85,000 orphans because of AIDS , " says Sandy Scott , the director of Tanya 's Children , a Los Angeles-based organization that tries to find adoptive families for children soon to be orphaned by the disease . To avoid having their children shuffled between foster homes or housed in institutions , a growing number of women are using their last months to plan something better . Here are the stories of five who were forced to look beyond their own families for homes , and who , by necessity , found very different solutions . A CHICAGO MOM AND HER SON BRACE FOR THE END In 1988 , after one of her best friends died of AIDS , Ida Greathouse watched in dismay as her friend 's orphaned son was shuffled between four foster homes in seven months . Greathouse , who had been found HIV positive four years earlier , says she " made a promise to myself that my son would not suffer that pain and injustice . " Says Greathouse : " Women should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now 40 , Greathouse had discovered her illness a decade ago when her boy , Silvano , 10 , was an infant . " I felt like a death sentence had been handed down to me , " says the Peru , Ill. , native who , because of her IV drug use and multiple sex partners , had been a high-risk candidate for AIDS . " At that time women were only living six months to a year after the diagnosis . " As her son grew older and her health remained stable , Greathouse gradually became active in AIDS causes in Chicago and , when he was old enough to understand , told Silvano about her illness . " I cried a lot . I thought my mother was going to die , " he says . " But she told me she was going to live as long as she could , so I knew we could still do stuff together . " One of the things they did was look for a permanent guardian for Silvano . His natural father is thought to have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suffers from AIDS and has been living in a residential care facility since March 1992 . Her family , from whom she has been estranged since her teens , was willing to adopt Silvano , but Greathouse did n't feel he 'd adapt well to their conventional lifestyle . " They wanted to change Silvano 's name to Americanize him , " she says . Silvano 's guardian angels came in the form of Robert " Rock " Simcina and Paul Gutierrez , a gay couple whom Greathouse and her son met three years ago through a volunteer program that delivers meals to AIDS patients . The four became fast friends , and , as Greathouse 's health worsened  --  for the past six months she has suffered from anemia and neuropathy , a disabling nerve disorder  --  Paul and Rock began spending more time with the boy . " It stuck in my mind that there were things like biking and tennis that his mother could n't do with him , " says Rock . Recognizing the growing bond between her son and Paul , 32 , and Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for Silvano after she died . " I was thrilled , " says Paul . Notes Rock : " He was the child I 'd always hoped for . " Greathouse says she does n't worry that Paul and Rock will influence Silvano 's sexuality  --  " I know he 's a heterosexual . " She has bigger concerns . If she dies before the governor of Illinois signs legislation allowing parents to establish standby guardianship , she fears her family will contest her will . She is also trying to prepare Silvano for her death by discussing with him which of her possessions he 'd like to keep and what will become of her body . She would like her ashes to be spread over Lake Michigan ; Silvano wants to keep them in an urn . " We 're still talking that one out , " she says . TOO ILL TO CARE FOR HER SON , AN L.A. MOTHER SETTLES FOR SUNDAY VISITS Two-year-old James Spindola is n't quite sure what to make of his mother . When he visits her each Sunday at Rue 's House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L.A. , he approaches cautiously . " Hey , Twinkle Toes , " she squeals , reaching out to hug him . But James is reticent , and his foster mother , Vera Lee , has to nudge him toward his mom . " At first I was jealous of the bond between Vera and James and how attached he is to her , " admits Jennifer Spindola , 26 . " But Vera understood . She said I would always be his mother . " It is Vera , though , who will raise James . Plagued by frequent attacks of AIDS-related asthma and pneumonia , Jennifer  --  who believes she contracted the disease from James 's father , an IV drug user  --  has been too ill to care for James , and her doctors are n't optimistic about how much longer she will live . " It does hurt , and it is scary that I might not be here for his next birthday or Christmas , " she says . " But when I ca n't fight this disease anymore , I will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was n't always the case . When Jennifer 's health began to decline shortly after James was born , the infant was bounced from foster home to foster home . James 's father , who left Jennifer when she became pregnant , did n't want anything to do with him . And Jennifer did n't want James raised by her parents because of her own unhappy childhood . Afraid for his future , she contacted Tanya 's Children . The foundation workers introduced her to Vera , 45 , a nurse 's aide at an L.A. AIDS center , who had been looking for a child to adopt . " I am getting older , and it 's hard to find the right man these days , " she says . When Vera , a single mother , first met Jennifer last October , she brought a photograph of her daughter , Kia , 24 , a college junior . She promised Jennifer that James too would attend private schools and college . " She had done such a good job raising her own child , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . " The next day , Vera began the guardianship paperwork , a process that should be completed later this month . In the meantime , James is making himself at home in Vera 's L.A. house , where he has lived since December . " He seems to have adjusted well , " says Vera . " He kisses and hugs me a lot . He always wakes up smiling . " For Jennifer , however , the adjustment has been much tougher . Clutching a large stuffed toy to her chest , she recalls waking up at Rue 's House thinking about her son sleeping happily in another woman 's home . " Some nights when I wish I was holding James , I hold this bunny rabbit for comfort , " she says sadly . " But I know this is the best decision for both of us . " JARRED BY HER RECENT DIAGNOSIS , A MOTHER OF THREE STARTS HER SEARCH In April , Mary Cross was called to her eldest son 's West Hollywood , Calif. , school where the second grader was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported the principal , but he had said some mean things about his mother . " Robby told me a really bad lie about you , " the principal reported . " He said you have HIV and that when you were young you used to do drugs in your arm . " " I said , " All of that is true , ' ' " says Cross , 43 . " Then the principal whirled around and said to Robby , " Your mother has HIV . You ca n't go around biting people ; you could give it to them . ' ' " Outraged , Cross says , she retorted , " He does n't have it , I do ! " Now 7 , Robby has had a turbulent past and , along with his brothers , twins Keith and Dennis , 6 , faces an uncertain future . Cross was found to be HIV positive a year ago and in January suffered an incapacitating bout of shingles , a viral disease sometimes associated with HIV . That episode scared her enough to begin looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going through is hell , " she says . Cross admits to years of heroin addiction and claims not to know which men in her past fathered her children . She is estranged from her family  --  including brother Randy Cross , a former San Francisco 49ers offensive lineman turned CBS sports commentator  --  over their disapproval of her life-style . She is uncertain how she got AIDS . " No one can tell me , " she says . " I either got it sexually or through intravenous drug use . " A good day , says Cross , who now takes AZT and an antibiotic , " is not being in bed all day . " But her best day will be when she finds someone she trusts to adopt her children . While she hopes the adoptive parents would send the boys to " nice schools , " her first priority is keeping the three , all of whom have tested negative for HIV , together . Robby is healthy , but Keith is learning-disabled , and Dennis , who has cerebral palsy , still wears diapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross says protectively . " Dennis has a sweet disposition , and Robby is very bright . " To find a home for her boys , Cross too has been working with Tanya 's Children . Last May a caseworker at the foundation told Cross that a family in New York State was interested in adopting the boys . But her health has temporarily stabilized , and Cross has been procrastinating . " I do n't know how to mentally prepare for what I have to do , " she says . Although she has explained her illness to her children , only Robby seems to grasp its severity . He is now struggling to brace himself emotionally . " I found out that I am a really brave kid , " says the 7-year-old proudly . " Because when I took a blood test for HIV , I did n't cry . " A MARYLAND MOTHER AND DAUGHTER MOVE IN WITH A FOSTER FAMILY " There will come a point when I 'll want to discontinue medications , " says Catherine Williams , 37 , who was found to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put tubes in me , and I do n't want to suffer . " When that time comes , Williams will know that her daughter , Elizabeth , 4 , who is HIV positive , will be cared for . After a prolonged search for the right foster home , Williams believes she has found it , in a white clapboard farmhouse amid the rolling green fields of suburban Maryland . There , Bill and Paulette F. ( who asked that their last name not be used ) , live with their three children , one of them a 3-year-old girl with AIDS whom they adopted last year . Williams and her daughter moved in two months ago . Williams , a former caseworker with the Maryland Department of Social Services , believes she contracted AIDS from a former lover who died of the disease . She began looking for a foster home for Elizabeth shortly after they were both found to be HIV positive in early 1991 . When she asked social workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital , where she and Elizabeth were being treated , about a foster home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got my first panicky twinges , " she says . " Since then it seems like I 've made 50,000 telephone calls . I 'm a professional social worker and it 's taken me two years . What happens to the average person ? " Williams admits that finding a home for her daughter might have been easier if she had relented on her insistence to meet the adoptive parents , something most adoption agencies do not permit . She also ruled out placing Elizabeth with the child 's father , who is dying of cancer and from whom Williams has been separated since shortly after Elizabeth 's birth . Williams 's elderly parents are also too ill to care for the girl . Last fall Williams met Bill , 50 , and Paulette , 39 , through a Baltimore church . The couple had served as foster parents to numerous HIV-positive children in their native New Jersey . When Bill , a computer technician , was transferred to Maryland in 1991 , they began looking for an AIDS family to live with them . " I thought if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking us , I would n't dawdle around , " says Williams . " I 've never had any misgivings about Bill and Paulette . " Elizabeth , who has suffered from chronic rashes and ear infections but who has not developed full-blown AIDS , understands that her mother is sick . She has slowly built a bond with Paulette and Bill . For Williams , who has been in and out of the hospital several times this spring , learning to let go has been both a trial and a relief . " I feel bad about leaving her . As much as I love her , I wo n't be there for her , " she says . " Everyone calls for their mom when they 're sick . She wo n't have that . But I know that Paulette and Bill will keep my memory alive for her . " THE SOLUTION FOR A FLORIDA MOTHER : SEPARATING HER TWO CHILDREN When Sophie Newman of Pompano Beach , Fla. , was seven months pregnant with her second child , she complained to her obstetrician about a white fungus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrush , a bacterial infection commonly associated with AIDS , and urged Newman to be tested . A week later she learned that she was HIV positive . For Newman , 41 , discovering her HIV status was the beginning of a devastating series of events . Unsure how long she had been infected ( she had been sexually involved with an IV drug user years earlier and received a blood transfusion after a car accident in 1980 ) , she decided to have her daughter , Lauren , then 6 , tested . Lauren , too , proved to be HIV positive . " You ca n't explain the feeling , " says Newman of her reaction . The only good news came when her son Zachary was born 10 weeks later . Although he tested HIV positive at birth , he converted to HIV negative after 18 months when his own antibodies replaced his mother 's . Happy with the knowledge that her son , now 3 , was healthy , Newman began the unsettling task of finding adoptive families for him and his sister , now 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Lauren 's years ago . As for Zachary 's father , she says , " I have no idea where he is or what he 's doing . These are my kids . These are my babies . " Newman 's parents , Herbert , 65 , a retired trucker , and Bernice , 61 , a toll supervisor for the Florida Turnpike , agreed to take Lauren but told Sophie that the prospect of caring for both an HIV-positive child and a toddler was too overwhelming . " They live in a one-bedroom condo , " says Sophie . " Grandpa is home , but he ca n't handle dealing with a 3-year-old . " So Newman turned to her best friend , Andrea White , who lives nearby . For four years White , 37 , a scheduler for a home nursing agency , and her husband , John , 42 , an information operator for Southern Bell , had been trying to have a second child . Like Newman , Andrea is white ; like Zachary 's father , John is African-American . " I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point I have no choice , " says Newman . " Nobody is going to take care of Lauren the way her grandmother is . And Andrea and Johnny have been together for 15 years . They have a house , they have a daughter . They 're an interracial couple who want a son . I 'm giving them one . " Sophie and her children see the Whites often , and John has already performed such surrogate dad duties as taking Zachary for his first haircut . " That was cool , " says White . For now , Newman and her children continue to live , somewhat precariously , in a neat two-bedroom rental home . Newman has been hospitalized once with an undiagnosed fever , suffers from severe headaches and is tired all the time . Despite her poor health , she cherishes every day . " My children keep me alive , " she says . " Zachary looks at me sometimes and says , " Mommy , do n't cry , ' ' " But she does . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
