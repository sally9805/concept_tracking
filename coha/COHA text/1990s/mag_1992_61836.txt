Death is not supposed to play favorites . Anguish is supposed to spread itself around . So you can understand why last week , after burying teammate Eric Andolsek in a Louisiana cemetery , several Detroit Lion players loosened their neckties , looked to the sky and said , " Enough already . " // Enough indeed . For the third time in seven months , fate had taken a horrible bite out of the Lions . They have become tragedy 's favorite team . How much more can they take ? // Last November , in a game against the Los Angeles Rams , starting guard Mike Utley , 26 , fell on his head while pass blocking and was paralyzed from the chest down . In May , Len Fontes , 54 , a popular assistant coach and brother of head coach Wayne Fontes , died in his sleep of a massive heart attack . On June 23 , Andolsek , 25 , another starting guard , was killed when a truck veered off the road in front of his house in Thibodaux , La. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like we 're cursed or something , " says a stunned Lomas Brown , Detroit 's All-Pro tackle . " We 've spent so much time at hospitals and cemeteries this past year . You keep thinking , What 's next ? Who 's next ? It 's frightening . " // It 's also especially disturbing in Detroit , where folks see enough senseless death and look to their sports teams for relief . True , for years the Lions broke more hearts than they comforted . Blown draft choices . No-name coaches . Seven seasons without a winning record . // But last season all that changed . Behind an improved defense and the stellar running of Barry Sanders , Detroit began to win . And it kept winning . It won its division . It won its first playoff game in 34 years . Suddenly , in January  --  a month that Detroiters usually spend counting the days until the Tigers begin spring training  --  the Lions were in the NFC Championship Game , playing for the right to go to the Super Bowl . ROAR RESTORED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Lions would right their ship , fate would try to tip it over again ? A more somber question : Has fate succeeded ? Utley 's paralysis was a horrible jolt , but Detroit overcame it , using his courage as inspiration . Besides , as Kevin Glover , the Lions ' veteran center , points out , " We could still talk to Mike . He was still alive . " // Then came two funerals in two months . Len Fontes 's teaching skills and dry wit were cherished by both players and fellow coaches . His death was devastating to Wayne , who arrived before the paramedics that morning and tried in vain to revive his brother . And Andolsek 's death has left everyone numb . He was a beloved player in the locker room , partial to big denim overalls to cover his squat , thick-necked body . // Now the resilience of the Lions will be tested in a way that all their old fumbles and missed tackles never tested them . " You know what I tell myself ? " says Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that being an athlete does n't mean anything . Bad things can happen to athletes for no reason , same way they do for everyone else . With Mike , Len and Eric , all of them , that 's the lesson . " // Consider it learned in Detroit . The hard way .
