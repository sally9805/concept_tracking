<p> ' HYPOCRITE ' AWARD <p> Post Washington Bureau Chief Bill McAllister reported in the Sept. 19 Beltway Notebook that Rep. Joel Hefley gave his ' porker of the week ' award to the National Science Foundation because of its $ 32,000 grant for research on an obscure point of Latin style . <p> Hefley himself deserves an award for ' hypocrite of the year ' because , after his criticism of the NSF , he announced that the House was proposing $ 115.4 billion for two projects at Peterson Air Force Base in his district . And Hefley consistently supports excessive military budgets , including next year 's for $ 280 billion-plus . <p> There must be some pork among all these hundreds of billions . I hope Hefley will begin to ferret it out with the same zeal he goes after the NSF for $ 32,000 . If not , he should be quiet about a few thousand.THOMAS M. RAUCH <p> Denver <p> PROPER MAINTENANCE OF JAILS , PUBLIC BUILDING SHOULD BE priority <p> Re : ' Jail needs $ 80 million face-lift , ' Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural jails , county building and other public capital assets being addressed ? Maintenance ! A jail forced to close due to condemnation may be in part because of overcrowding , but more often it is due to a dilapidated building that has been neglected by the very representatives who gladly propose funding for a replacement . <p> In our public accounting system , the expenditure for capital assets is separate from the ongoing cost to maintain the asset . A commercial building has a depreciation expense , part of which can fund repairs and upgrades . <p> We tend , in the public accounting system , to fund jobs and operating costs , but forgo maintenance and upgrades that are critical to the building . We have many 35-year-old buildings in Colorado that continue to serve their intended customers ; yet we quickly abandon public buildings that did not or could not meet changing needs . How do maintenance budgets compare with their commercial counterparts ? Is it a responsibility of our representatives that has become buried in the desire to create jobs with public spending ? <p> DAVID J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUIET DEATH <p> As a former Denver teacher , I have fearless predictions for both Denver teachers and for Post columnist Al Knight . Teachers first . <p> The pilot ' merit ' pay provision of the new teacher-board contract will die a comparatively quiet death when it proves to be less than meritorious . Under the plan , a few teachers will pick up some extra bucks but there will be no equity in the process . There ca n't be , because no one on this planet has ever been smart enough to devise a teacher compensation plan that can fairly factor in all the variables that clearly differentiate between essentially equal teachers . Moreover , there are limited dollars in the merit pay kitty , so which ' meritorious ' teachers get left out ? Somebody solve that problem for me . I submit that ' merit ' pay is nothing more than a return to the ' good ol ' boy ' system of playing favorites . Al Knight next . <p> Ever the public education critic , Knight writes predictably about the failure of the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His commentary ( ' Defenders of the status quo , ' Sept. 2 ) clearly demonstrates that he fashions himself an expert on both the schools and on teacher-board negotiations . He sees the merit-pay plan as wonderfully new and exciting and can see no reason why teachers are n't jumping with joy at the prospect of seeing their efforts rewarded with extra pay . <p> Well , Mr. Knight may lie awake nights , if he must , in pursuit of the degradation of teacher unions and their goals , but he should realize that there are those among us who openly challenge both his viewpoint and the way he chooses to write about public education . Largely , his contributions will , as they have in the past , impact the future discourse only minimally . <p> HAROLD R. DUNN <p> Aurora <p> NO EASY ANSWER TO IMPROVING SCHOOLS <p> If the parents of children in struggling schools who are currently being wooed in support of vouchers for private education think the wealthy conservative backers of vouchers might actually want your children alongside theirs , enjoying the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no quick and easy answers to improving the quality of schools and the performance of underachieving students . High standards and expectations and community values are important . Quality teachers and smaller class sizes offer the most direct line to excellence in education , but these require more funding , something our Legislature has rarely found in its heart to do . Police and prisons do quite well enough , thank you . <p> Nor perhaps , as our legislators and politicians whine and cry alligator tears , can they do much as long as education in Colorado is included under TABOR restrictions . Our public schools face greater responsibilities and challenges than ever dreamed by private and religious schools , and their educators and the public they serve deserve greater respect than ever they receive . Placing value on education requires much more reality than empty political rhetoric provides . <p> ROBERT PORATH <p> Boulder <p> THE TOY GESTAPO <p> In response to people 's statements about the Sears trench coat figure I would like to say that I am disappointed . People have nothing better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame - for our culture . <p> Yes , I think that the Sears trench coat doll is in less than sterile tastes but must everything be sterile ? Should we ban G.I. Joes and play guns ? What about trench coats as a whole ? When people look so hard for something to blame it is only a matter of time until we all look alike and dress alike and do nothing but put puzzles together and eat tofu . Then what will we do when the violence continues ? Then what will we blame ? <p> I am sure that there are more effective ways for all of these parents to save the world , rather that playing the toy Gestapo . <p> JESSE KEENE <p> Buffalo Creek <p> COMPANY TO LOSE MONEY <p> Let me play a little violin for Scott Allen , vice president of 21 Century Toys . He says his small company will lose millions because Sears pulled the item from its catalog . Did he and the other toymakers take any notice of the two guns the villain happens to be toting ? Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( especially after April 20 ) would buy that doll for their child . <p> However , the doll does have its merits . If a child puts it on his Christmas wish list , then you know it 's time to get him to a mental health professional . <p> JILL BECKERS <p> Thornton <p> SOMETHING NOT RIGHT <p> It may be me , but something here seems a little strange . Sears sells a toy doll ( a product aimed at ' ages 5 and up ' ) complete with black mask , automatic rifle , shotgun strapped to his leg and black trench coat . The similarity to Columbine 's gunmen is striking , and a jumpy mother calls the company . They pull the doll , and the manufacturer is suddenly stuck with the marketplace equivalent of an Adolf Hitler doll . To make the menacing doll more ' consumer friendly ' the manufacturer looks at his product , inspects its toy weaponry and decides to remove its trench coat . Is the trench coat really the reason that people are shocked that this is a toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like him ? <p> PATRICK FITZ-GERALD <p> Evergreen <p> WATER QUALITY ' TOPS ' <p> I have worked at six water treatment plants and served as chief plant operator at three of them . As a professional in the water treatment field , I am compelled to address the unwarranted decrease of the public 's trust in water quality . <p> In undeveloped countries people die every day from waterborne diseases such as cholera , diphtheria , polio and typhus . In the United States , water treatment practices and vaccination programs have helped eradicate these diseases . The reality is that the quality of our water has never been higher . <p> At the water plant where I work we have a computer monitoring the treatment and distribution system that receives more than 1,200 signals every five seconds ! That plant is staffed 24 hours a day , every day of the year , by a professional water treatment plant operator licensed by the Colorado Department of Health . <p> Should any critical part of the process begin to deviate from desired parameters an alarm signals the operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water supplied to the American comes from plants with computer controls , monitoring and alarm systems operated by licensed professionals 24 hours a day , every day of the year . <p> JOHN J.
