Tom Brokaw writes a heartfelt tribute to his parents ' generation , tireless shapers of the American century Photograph " He 's a very emotional person , " says Brokaw 's daughter Jennifer . " He 's definitely sentimental , and that came through in the book . " // As the unflappable anchorman of NBC 's Nightly News , Tom Brokaw has spent the last 16 years talking the nation coolly through controversy , triumph and tragedy . But when he appeared on CNBC 's Tim Russert show last month to discuss The Greatest Generation , his book on the men and women who came of age during the Depression and World War II , Brokaw 's eyes filled with tears . " This whole thing has been very emotional for me , " he said , his voice breaking . " I learned from my father the importance of honest hard work . There was this constant in my parents ' life about family and values and doing the right thing . " Though Anthony " Red " Brokaw died in 1982 , his widow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in California . " She told me , " Brokaw recalls with a chuckle , " to stop crying . " And he did . Yet Brokaw , 58 , is n't the only American who feels touched by the sacrifices of the generation that preceded his own . Published last month , Generation , a collection of some 50 profiles of men and women , rose quickly to the top of the New York Times bestseller list . A documentary based on the book will air on NBC on Jan. 15 . And though Brokaw includes a few familiar faces ( such as Bob Dole , Julia Child and Art Buchwald ) among his subjects , he believes the challenges the World War II generation faced-a depression , a world war and the birth of modern America-transformed even ordinary people into extraordinary achievers and heroes . " This generation had impact well beyond their own shores and their own interests , " Brokaw says . " It was a privilege to tell their stories . " Photograph Brokaw ( in ' ' 44 ) says of World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Brokaw 's labor of love-his first book-is also adding luster to his own reputation . Smart , handsome and still able to radiate the plainspoken values of his South Dakota boyhood , Brokaw has spent nearly four decades ascending the TV news ladder-overcoming his occasionally sloppy diction ( " If I 'm tired or if I 'm rushing , I 'll drop the l , " he admits ) , years of shaky ratings and a threatened libel lawsuit from wrongly accused Atlanta Olympics bombing suspect Richard Jewell-to become one of the most trusted faces in TV journalism . " He 's morally centered and decent , " says Brokaw 's friend , writer-director Nora Ephron . " If Jimmy Stewart were an anchorman , he 'd be Tom Brokaw . " When Brokaw went to Normandy in 1984 to cover the 40th anniversary of D-Day , his conversations with veterans revealed tales of heroism that transcended anything he 'd imagined . Brokaw 's eyes shine as , sitting in the kitchen of his expansive Manhattan apartment , he recalls people like Leonard " Bud " Lomell , a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff at Pointe-du-Hoc on D-Day and was wounded three times during the war . " I was emotionally brought to my knees , " Brokaw says . " I felt a kind of missionary zeal for the men and women of World War II , for spreading the word of their remarkable lives . " Brokaw 's respect for his parents ' generation goes far beyond their wartime sacrifices . James Dowling , for example , who is profiled in the book , came home to Smithtown , N.Y , and not only started his own seafood-trucking business but also set up a hugely successful Little League . Then , after being elected the town 's superintendent of highways , he oversaw the modernization of roads in his rapidly growing part of Long Island . " From Norman Lear all the way across the political spectrum to Bob Dole , " Brokaw observes , " they would say it was important to honor your country and feel a sense of duty and responsibility not just for yourself , but for your family and your community . You took pride in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonated for Brokaw . After all , it was exactly how his parents had lived their lives . The eldest of three boys born to Red , a construction-equipment operator , and Jean , a homemaker who also held retail and postal jobs over the years , Brokaw ( eventually joined by brothers Bill , now 56 , and Mike , 55 ) spent his early years in a cabin on an Army base in the tiny town of Igloo , S.Dak. , where his father kept the machinery running . Two years after the war ended , the family moved to Pickstown , on the Yankton Sioux reservation , where Red worked as a foreman on government projects while his eldest son spent hours on the Missouri River and in the nearby hills hunting , fishing and camping . When the family moved to the relatively cosmopolitan town of Yankton in 1955 , Brokaw enrolled at Yankton High , where he took up football , basketball and track , jumped into student government and earned a place on the honor roll .

It was n't long before Tom found his way to the other side of the camera . After impressing South Dakota war hero-governor Joe Foss with his knowledge of political history during an American Legion Boys ' State conference in 1957 , the high schooler was invited by Foss to be his partner on a TV quiz show called Two for the Money , where the South Dakotans won $612 each . But after starting classes at the University of South Dakota the following year , Brokaw fell into slacker mode . " Lots of girlfriends , lots of good times , lots of missed classes , " he says ruefully . " I assumed that I would get what I wanted just by showing up . " Taking a semester off to get himself together , Brokaw went home to Yankton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged him to apply for work at a TV station in nearby Sioux City , Iowa . Sure enough , Brokaw landed a job as the station 's all-purpose announcer , doing everything from weather reports to a cooking show . Soon he abandoned his plan to become a lawyer and even after returning to college full-time kept his job on TV . " I was a poor kid from a remote place , and I thought , This is going to get me out of here , " ' he says . After graduating in 1962 , Brokaw married his high school **28;596;TOOLONG , Meredith Auld , and took a better job in Omaha , then moved up to WSB-TV in Atlanta in 1965 . A year later he joined the news staff at KNBC in Los Angeles , where he eventually worked with sportscaster Bryant Gumbel . " A lot of us were n't sure where we wanted to end up , " Gumbel recalls . " But Tom always knew what he wanted to do . He wanted to anchor the evening news . " Photograph Martha Settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor after the war , Brokaw writes .

In 1973 , NBC tapped him to cover the White House , and three years later he took a seat on the Today show , where his poise and warmth earned him a loyal following that still includes cohost Jane Pauley . " On his feet , he 's simply the finest there is , " she says . Network bosses agreed , and in 1982 Brokaw became coanchor ( with Roger Mudd ) of the Nightly News . Mudd departed a year later , and Brokaw has held the position ever since . It has n't always been easy , but as ratings have risen to the top in the past couple of years , so has his reputation . " When people watch him , they feel he is n't just reading from a script , " says Gumbel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's talking about . " Photograph " I 'd like to spend more time reflecting , " says Brokaw ( at a book event in New York City ) . // Despite the accoutrements of his life in New York City-a swank Park Avenue duplex , a wine collection , a roster of friends that includes Robert Redford and Harrison Ford-Brokaw remains a dedicated outdoorsman who often escapes to the 4,000-acre spread he keeps near the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area in Montana . He and Meredith , 58 , a writer and former owner of a chain of upscale toy stores , have three daughters : Jennifer , 32 , an emergency-room doctor ; Andie , 30 , a record company producer ; and Sarah , 28 , a psychiatric social worker . Brokaw also has a group of pals dubbed the Phun Hogs , with whom he has kayaked in Siberia , flyfished in Iceland and scaled an array of mountains , including Mount Rainier and Grand Teton . " He loves being in the outdoors so much , he could do it for the rest of his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yvon Chouinard . " But he likes being around important people and stuff too . He truly likes to do it all . " That impulse tends to wreak havoc on Brokaw 's ability to sleep , often pulling him out of bed at 3:30 a.m. , at which time he pads to his home gym for a weight-lifting session . He turned down President Clinton 's 1993 offer to run the National Park Service and now has a reported five-year , $35 million contract that will keep him in the NBC anchor chair until 2002 . But Brokaw , sitting in his office at Rockefeller Center beneath shelves crammed with awards and photos of himself with leaders ranging from the Dalai Lama to Margaret Thatcher , says he yearns to work on projects with more " permanence " than the evening news . " I think he envies us , " says former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee , whose wartime exploits became a part of The Greatest Generation .

" I think he realizes that after everything he has seen all over the world , " says Jean Brokaw , " we did have values .
