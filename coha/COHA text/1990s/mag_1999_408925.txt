The heart of pilgrimage is conversion , Headnote not travel ; the journey is only the means to the end . // HERE IN ROME , the numbers of visitors expected for Jubilee 2000 have increased continuously as we approach Christmas 1999 , when the pope will open the Holy Door at St. Peter 's Basilica . The Eternal City ordinarily welcomes about seven million people each year . Present estimates for the jubilee have now gone above 20 million visitors . Yet behind all the preparation and all the advertisement for the jubilee , there lies a quite troubling question : will the ordinary visitor who comes to Rome have the opportunity to experience the holy ? The words pilgrimage and pilgrim are prominently placed in the travel literature and advertising that promote visiting Rome during the jubilee , but will anyone actually make a pilgrimage or be a pilgrim ? - As someone who for more than a year has been involved in the preparations to welcome Americans to Rome in the Holy Year , I find myself asking , can we rescue the very soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor does it have to do with the good will and efforts of the various bishops ' conferences around the world . The Roman Catholic leadership wants the Holy Year to succeed and to be a graced moment in time for all who experience it . The problem is in the very nature of Rome itself as a travel destination and of the tourist industry that has grown up around it . The travel industry has packaged Rome in such a way that comfort , scheduling and simplification are the hallmarks of a visit to the Eternal City . The opportunity truly to engage the holy , to be given the time to open oneself to the transcendent and to be touched or challenged by something outside of ordinary experience is rarely present . Yet these elements are fundamental to an authentic pilgrimage . Outside the Familiar It was once possible to distinguish between a tourist and a pilgrim . A tourist was a traveler who sought to replicate in a foreign land much of his or her own world . Guides in the form of persons or books translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other creature comforts ; and , most importantly , cameras and souvenirs provided the means fondly to remember the trip . These were meant to soften the hardship of travel and make the journey as comfortable as possible . An industry was created around a traveler 's needs , and today such names as Hilton , Sheraton , Kodak , McDonald 's , Michelin , Visa and American Express are recognizable services that have become identified with tourism . A pilgrim , by distinction , was a traveler in search of something outside of the familiar . Pilgrimage was and is , at its core , a journey into the unknown . The beginning act of a pilgrimage is to place oneself into the hands of God . Through this act of faith , a pilgrim goes in search of the holy away from the structures of everyday life . This could be dangerous and was often uncomfortable , but the danger and discomfort were a part of the spiritual journey , a discipline taken up for the forgiveness of sin . For early and medieval Christians , to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious accomplishment , as it still is today for Muslims who journey to Mecca . For Western Christians , the comforts of tourism serve as an obstruction and can obscure or prevent the dynamics of pilgrimage from taking place . Today there is between tourist and pilgrim a new category of traveler , the religious tourist . This is someone who comes to Rome for a religious purpose , but does not know how to reach that spiritual goal . In the three years I have been in Rome as rector of the American Catholic community , I am always struck by the religious aspirations of visitors . Americans who visit Rome are wondrously open to have God touch their hearts . To be a Catholic and come to the city of the Apostles and to walk in the places of martyrs , mystics and saints , it is quite reasonable to expect to experience something of the holy . While the expectation is authentic , sadly the tools and opportunities for such an experience are few . Surrounded by professional travel consultants , bus schedules , group dinners and frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly burned past the spiritual richness of Rome . While their trip may be called a pilgrimage , they will be little more than religious tourists with great expectations and little spiritual direction . This is not meant as a polemic against professionals in the travel business . I work with several Catholic travel services that are excellent . The true challenge in Catholic travel is to move people past the creature comforts of their trip and toward the spiritual richness of what they are encountering . Open the Gate There are other contributing problems as well . The great churches of Rome are often treated as museums rather than as holy places . As rector of one of the oldest churches in the city , I see this daily . While cameras flash and guides explain the coloring in the 16th-century frescos that adorn the nave of my church , the fact that five saints rest here is often passed over or little noticed . Below the church is the crypt , which stands on the site of the dining room of this old Roman house . Here the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eucharist , and it was here that they made the difficult decision to oppose the Emperor Diocletian and face death . Yet because of concerns about security , we can not always keep this site open . I remember taking a group of visitors to the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere . When we reached the crypt where the saint is buried , the gate was locked . When I asked the nun who was sacristan if she could open the gate , she cried out , " Of course not , and I never will , because people steal ! " Beyond security issues , many of the historic churches of Rome are strapped for funding . At the first meeting at the Lateran Palace between rectors of historic churches and the Vatican Jubilee Committee , we listened as a panel of Vatican experts instructed us on their expectations . We were to welcome everyone , bend over backward to accommodate groups for Mass and keep the lights on . At this point the rector of one the great basilicas stood up and asked , " Who is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely silent . The same dynamic occurred when Vatican officials met with the rectors of Rome 's 20 national churches . Only Santa Susanna , the American church , had actively created programs for visitors . There is also what I call a " Roman attitude " among some of the people who work in these churches . In part , because tourists are many and pilgrims are few , it becomes an issue of managing visitors rather than assisting them . You can understand this attitude after you have been in Rome and seen too many groups come through your church . If tourists enter these holy places with no intention of saying a prayer or with little reverence for where they are standing , then why retell the story of how this site became holy , or turn on the lights , or take them to that special place where a moment of Christian heroism occurred ? Sadly these wonderful churches , which to me are the very heart of Christian Rome , are often entered by accident , and their spiritual importance is rarely explained . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of religious tourism . In the simplified . or streamlined " pilgrimage , " every visitor goes to St. Peter 's or one of the other three patriarchal basilicas : St. John Lateran , St. Mary Major and St. Paul Outside the Walls . This is both encouraged and enhanced during holy years by the tradition of the Holy Doors . Yet even here most people do n't know what surrounds them . How often have I watched visitors standing on the great porphyry disk at the back of St. Peter 's Basilica . This is all that is left of the steps of the old high altar torn down in 1506 . Here they stand looking up the aisle , never aware that their feet rest on the sacred stone where generations of Holy Roman Emperors knelt to be crowned by the pope , a tradition that goes back to Charlemagne and was once considered as a possible sacrament . There are many examples of this . How many people walk by the tombs of St. Gregory the Great or St. John Chrysostom in St. Peter 's , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb of St. Timothy in St. Paul 's ? While these figures are important in the history of Christianity , most visitors do n't even know they are there . The dynamic of religious tourism has not only obscured but also simplified what was once a unique journey toward the holy . Instead of being a rich and varied experience , the modern pilgrimage to Rome has been reduced to two things : seeing the pope and celebrating Mass in various churches . While these are beneficial and grace-filled activities , they are only a part , not the totality of pilgrimage . The spiritual hunger to be in the presence of the pope and to receive his blessing speaks as much to the lack of opportunity to experience the holy in Rome , as it does to the actual moment of being with John Paul 11 . While the papal household tries to make the pope as available as possible , seeing him has become the only way to validate a trip to Rome as a religious tourist . I ca n't begin to tell you how saddened people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover they have arrived the day after the pope 's audience . Their world collapses , as if there was nothing else of the holy to experience in Rome . Context of Celebration How many times have groups celebrated Mass in a historic church without being able to put that celebration in context in terms of what surrounds them ? How are the rich spiritual traditions of the Benedictines , Dominicans , Franciscans , Oratorians , Jesuits or Cistercians , experienced by visiting their churches in Rome ? The simplified and reduced answer for religious tourism is to celebrate Mass without context . The Eucharist is at the center of our faith as Catholics , but the single act of its celebration does not always connect the holiness and spiritual tradition of a particular place to our consciousness . The stories of faith or religious heroism of the martyrs and saints need to be retold at these moments if a visitor is to understand where they are . The insights of spiritual teachers like Ignatius Loyola , Philip Neri or Catherine of Siena need to be explained , when visitors walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stood . Photograph VISITORS PACK ST . PETER 'S SQUARE . A statue of St. Peter looms over a crowd packed into St. Peter 's Square for a papal ceremony . It is expected that during the jubilee year more than 20 million people will visit Rome as pilgrims , tourists or what the author calls " religious tourists . " // But it is not too late to rescue the jubilee . Rome is rich with opportunities to experience the holy , and people will continue to come to Rome with the hope that this will happen . But we must move beyond a preoccupation with physical comfort and rigid itineraries . The dynamic of religious tourism , especially reductionism and simplification , needs to be replaced . We need to see that the great churches of Rome are open , but also that the stories of why they are holy are retold when visitors enter these places . The pope will make himself as accessible as possible , but we need to help people realize that seeing him is not the only way to validate a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liturgy for pilgrims but in a way that connects the spiritual traditions of these holy places to their prayer . Advice for the Pilgrim Pilgrimage is a journey toward the holy , and visitors need to be given the tools and the orientation to take on the role of pilgrim . There are a number of ways to prepare for the trip . Jubilee guides are just beginning to be published , and most are uneven . While there are a number of very good books on Rome , my suggestion for a potential visitor is to read up on the subject of pilgrimage . Here you will learn some of the basic dynamics that can influence your trip . Have your bookstore do a subject search for you . Take some time to reflect before you come to Rome . How might a journey toward the holy help to clarify , heal or resolve some of these questions and issues of your present life ? Keep a journal while you are here and make a point of ending your day by doing some quiet reflection and some writing . Explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches not only to look around but to pray . The heart of pilgrimage is conversion , not travel , for the journey is only the means to the end . It is not what or who you see in Rome , it is how you encounter God in these moments that is most important . The jubilee is a wonderful opportunity , rich with possibilities for individual conversion , but the key for the individual pilgrim is to have these possibilities explained and presented in such a manner that they are accessible . In the great jubilee of 1500 the idea of a holy door for pilgrims was introduced . To walk through the door was to demonstrate that you wished to change your life and enter into a new time of grace . Today there are four such doors in Rome . And Rome is filled with other spiritual portals that extend a similar invitation . It is just a matter of finding them .
