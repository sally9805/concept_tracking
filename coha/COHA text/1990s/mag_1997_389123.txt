WITH SO MANY BLACK ARTISTS , DEALERS AND GALLERIES ON THE SCENE , AFRICANAMERICAN ART NEEDS MORE COLLECTORSLIKE YOU ! // For three days , a line stretched down the block as Black folks-from babies to baby boomers , hip-hoppers to oldtimers-crowded into the mazelike exhibition space , hungry for some reflection of themselves . They feasted their eyes on fine art from a melange of artists ' palettes . For some , it was the first taste of the works of twentieth-century masters-Romare Bearden 's collages , Jacob Lawrence 's historical narratives , Charles White 's exquisitely drafted portraits , Augusta Savage 's and Elizabeth Catlett 's deeply expressive sculptures , William H. Johnson 's dancing landscapes , Norman Lewis 's lyrical abstracts , and Lois Mailou Jones 's bright realism and African geometric forms . Others saw glimpses of greatness in emerging contemporary artists such as Arlene Case , Nanette Carter and Alison Saar . All had come for the first annual National Black Fine Arts Show in New York ( contact Wainwright/Smith Associates , Ltd. , 212 7775218 ) . But the occasion could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta , the annual Lake Meadows Art Fair in Chicago or any gallery or museum opening around the country showing the works of Black artists worldwide . The works of art exhibited in these venues represent a window on America and , indeed , on the world . Visual , visceral distillations of the Black experience , they are witness to the beauty and depth of the souls of Black people . As such , they touch something deep in us and ignite a desire to collect them , communicate with them . Our artists are the mediums through whom the ancestors speak , and these works are word . For many of us , the objects of our desire can seem forever out of reach . But collecting the art of our culture need not be a dream deferred . " You do n't have to be a Reginald Lewis or an Oprah Winfrey to collect , " says Paul Jones , a major collector and now board member of the High Museum in Atlanta . " Just buy within your means , and buy what you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TLC Beatrice International Holdings , Inc. , started out buying paintings by young Black contemporary artists such as Vincent Smith , Edward Clark , Betty Blayton Taylor and Benny Andrews for $2,000 to $4,000 .

Arlene Case , Summer Samba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Isobel Neal , an art consultant to Chicago 's G.R. N'Namdi Gallery , advises beginning collectors , " If your pockets are n't that deep , then you ought to buy contemporary artists , because that 's what the masters from the 1930 's and 1940 's were in their time-contemporary artists supported by a small group of people who were buying their art at the right price . " Twenty years ago much of the work of these masters-including Bearden , Lawrence , Norman Lewis , Beauford Delaney , Palmer Hayden and others-could be had for a few thousand dollars ; 30 years ago , it went for a few hundred . As late as 1986 , Sherry Washington purchased a 9-by-12-inch Bearden watercolor for $500 . She sold it for $8,000 in 1990 to finance her new business , the Sherry Washington Gallery in Detroit . The same watercolor today is valued at $17,000 . Loris Crawford , owner of Savacou Gallery in New York , notes that only a few years ago , paintings by nineteenth-century Black masters were auctioned off at Christie 's and Sotheby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry O. Tanner went for $2,000 , an Edward M. Bannister for $3,000 . " The average AfricanAmerican collector does n't even know that these works get auctioned off , " Crawford says . " And a lot of the White collectors are not even aware of who these artists are . " The smaller paintings by the artists named above can sell today for between $30,000 and $40,000 . As an investment , African-American art has outperformed the stock market . Joscelyn Wainwright , the organizer of the National Black Fine Arts Show , is trying to pull some coats in the community : " Much of the art today is available at prices that next year may be referred to as historic bargains . " " It just takes a little courage , " says Harriet Kelley of San Antonio , who , with her husband , Hammond , began collecting in 1987 . " Even our CPA wondered why we were buying all this art Now he admits it was one of the smartest things we ever did . " Photograph 1 . S. Scott Davis III , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann Collection . 2 .

" Our people spend more than that on Louis Vuitton bags , fur coats and new cars , " she says . But while those things will depreciate to nothing in ten to 20 years , a comparably priced work of art by an African-American artist will more than likely double or triple in value . Peg Alston , a 25-year veteran dealer in Black art , says , " People often do n't realize they can pay for the art in installments . " There are definite advantages to this : " If you wait until you 've saved enough money to pay for it all at once , " she says , " you may find that the price has gone up or , worse , that someone else has bought it . " The best and most consistent advice collectors and dealers give is to buy work you love , but collect it , if you can , in a quality that will appreciate . A poster is just a reproduction , and it 's unlikely that even a signed reproduction will ever be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taha , art adviser and author of the forthcoming book Collecting African American Art : A Guide to Works on Paper and Canvas ( Crown Publishing , November 1998 ) , notes that " many collectors began collecting exhibition posters for the images and aesthetic education before they were able to afford original works or even limited-edition prints . " Alston , who founded the Peg Alston Fine Arts gallery in New York City in 1972 , adds that " posters are still a reflection of our African-American artists and their creativity . " Among those buying are the thousands who in time will graduate from collecting posters to limited-edition prints and even original works . Mercer Redcross of the October Gallery in Philadelphia has observed younger brothers and sisters coming into the gallery . " They 've bought the posters , the reproductions of works by such artists as Leroy Campbell and Charles Bibbs , and they 're saying , " I want to be a little more of a collector , but I ca n't afford the originals . ' So they 'll go to the serigraphs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , buying the original is ideal , but in some cases the original is priced out of reach or is not available . So the only way you can get what you want is to go with a print . And that 's good , because it keeps people from saying " I ca n't participate in this unless I have $10,000 or $20,000 . ' " Taha urges beginning collectors to consider limitededition prints : " They 're affordable , they can provide a great deal of pleasure , and most artists who work on canvas also work on paper . " Of course , when you start with a Jacob Lawrence or Romare Bearden lithograph , it 's a considerable financial investment-perhaps $2,000 to $4,000 or more . Shop around and get some good advice . Find dealers and galleries you can trust , and build relationships with them . Black gallery owners are generally eager to share their knowledge and experience and can help you identify and begin collecting the next generation of masters at affordable prices . Prices are negotiable . Learn about the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , want to see their work collected by people who understand and appreciate it , not just by those who buy as an investment , solely to make a quick profit " Go to the galleries , " stresses Taha . " Admission is free-no cover , no minimum-and it 's an education . " By looking at a lot of work , you will begin to develop an eye for what you like . Collector and dealer Irene Ericsson-Houston of Houston , Texas , sees many of our folk exclusively buying pieces that have " very definite Black images . Unfortunately , they 're overlooking some very fine work by Black artists who are doing still lifes , landscapes or abstracts . " But Margaret Porter Troupe , who owns the Porter Troupe Gallery in San Diego , has met a lot of African-Americans who are buying abstract art . " I had a show of Scott Davis 's work in 1992 .

Exquisite work by Frank Stewart , Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe , Eli Reed , Jules Allen , Chester Higgins , Lorna Simpson and Carrie Mae Weems can be acquired for less than $1,000 . Photographs by such past masters as P.H. Polk and James Van der Zee are rarer . Younger buyers are collecting a large number of emerging and established contemporary artists working in a wide range of styles and media . Some of the many names being mentioned all across the country-besides the artists whose work illustrates this story-include Radcliffe Bailey , Carole Bayard , Charles Burwell , Leroy Campbell , Robert Colescott , Sam Gilliam , David Hammons , Cynthia Hawkins , Al Hollingsworth , Oliver Jackson , Margaret Slade Kelley , Artis Lane , Kerry James Marshall , Valerie Maynard , Sana Musasama , Betye Saar , Eve Sandler , Gilda Snowden , Allen Stringfellow , Ann Tanksley and Pheoris West .
