When it comes to birth control , medical science has presented women with a kaleidoscope of choices : the pill , insertable Norplant capsules , injectable Depo-Provera , the female condom and , of course , those old staples-the condom , diaphragm , cervical cap , intrauterine device ( IUD ) and sterilization ( or " getting your tubes tied " ) . For the most part , these methods work . They 're easy . They 're convenient . But for many women , convenience has a price : Mood swings , migraines , yeast infections , vitamin deficiencies , ectopic pregnancies and increased risks for cardiovascular disease and cancer have all been linked to the use of artificial contraceptives . Consequently , many women are going au naturel , opting , instead , for something that has no chemicals , no side effects and a surprisingly low risk of pregnancy . Something , ironically , that the Catholic Church has been pushing for years-natural family planning , a.k.a. natural birth control . The concept of regulating fertility is ancient . Even the Bible makes reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where contraceptives are often scarce and expensive , modern methods of natural birth control do not have a strong following in the United States . Just 3 percent of all contraception users here choose natural birth control , according to the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth , the last year for which figures are available , compared with the dominant three methods-sterilization ( 27.7 percent ) , the pill ( 26.9 percent ) and condoms ( 20.4 percent ) - which account for a whopping 75 percent of the market . Photograph // Going natural could be contraception 's best-kept secret . Doctors do n't promote it . Nor do many women 's health clinics . Even midwives may not be up on it . In fact , until the early 1970s , when women 's health organizations began paying attention , scientifically valid information about natural birth control was largely available only through the Catholic Church and conservative Christian-based organizations , such as the Couple to Couple League and the Billings Ovulation Method Association ( BOMA ) . But given the recent surge of interest in alternative health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holistic health perspectives are actively seeking out information on natural birth control . " Ovaries are n't Catholic , " quips Kay Ek , president of the Billings Ovulation Method Association-U.S.A. in St. Cloud , M.N. " We teach women of all philosophies and religions . " It 's All in the Timing The natural birth control concept is stunningly simple : A woman determines the point in her menstrual cycle when she 's considered primed to conceive and avoids sexual activity that would result in pregnancy . If this sounds suspiciously like the oldfashioned , and highly risky , rhythm method , take heart-it 's not . " People still identify them together , " sighs Sister Marian Brady , a reproductive-issues specialist and director of the philosophy program at the Catholic University of America in Washington , D.C. " Nobody teaches the rhythm method anymore . They think this is a new name for an old method , but it 's a new name for a new method . " In fact , depending on who 's talking , natural birth control may be called by a few different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning . That 's because in the politically charged birth control arena , the two groups promoting this method-conservative Christians and feminists-are usually on opposite sides . With natural birth control , their goal-preventing unwanted pregnancy-is the same , but their philosophies still differ radically . Religious organizations use the term natural family planning . They do n't view this as birth control per se but as an acceptable method for married couples to space births until they reach their desired family size . They preach total abstinence during the time when a woman is able to conceive , unless the couple is open to the possibility of having a baby . Women 's health advocates , on the other hand , teach the fertility awareness method and emphasize a woman 's right to choose whether she 'll alter her sexual activity , postpone sex altogether or use a barrier method , like a condom or diaphragm , when she 's most likely to conceive . " We come from different perspectives , but we meet on common ground to make sure women have this information , " says Toni Weschler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charge of Your Fertility ( HarperCollins , 1995 ) . Regardless of what you call it , advocates on both sides say that today , natural birth control is sophisticated , grounded in science and far more reliable than it used to be . " When understood thoroughly and used correctly , natural methods of birth control are as effective as the pill when intercourse occurs only on infertile days , " says Barbara Feldman , director of New York City 's Fertility Awareness Center , which provides information , seminars and counseling . How does it work ? It 's all in the timing . The critical questions to ask are : When is my fertile period ? How long does it last ? Have I ovulated yet ? ( See Figuring Out Fertility , below ) . Natural birth control is based on three key principles : That an egg , released during ovulation , is viable-i.e. , able to be fertilized-for 24 hours ; that after ejaculation , sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for two to five days ; and that there is a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get pregnant . Find-and avoid-that window , and you 're golden . Although this timing can shift monthly ( because of stress , changes in diet or illness ) , the body drops some fairly obvious clues to help you find it . Cervical fluid ( also called mucous ) is the primary indicator for the start of the fertile period . Cervical fluid appears as a harmless discharge on your underwear or on toilet paper when you go to the bathroom ; its job is to nourish sperm and help them reach the egg . As estrogen levels rise and you approach ovulation , cervical fluid 's consistency changes from tacky to creamy to extremely stretchy , like raw egg white . Changes also occur in the cervix : The opening widens , the cervix gets softer and actually rises to make it more receptive to sperm . A subtle increase ( about four-tenths of a degree ) in basal body temperature ( taken first thing in the morning before you get out of bed ) , which is caused by rising progesterone levels , signals that ovulation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these changes are noted daily on a chart designed for this purpose , patterns emerge , and the window of fertility becomes crystal clear . You can track these shifts in several ways : The Billings method ( a.k.a. the ovulation or mucous method ) , named for the Australian doctors John and Evelyn Billings who pioneered it in the 1950s , evaluates the presence and condition of cervical fluid . Another , the temperature method , while rarely used alone , notes shifts in basal body temperature . The sympto-thermal method , probably the most reliable given its system of cross checks , monitors cervical fluid , temperature and the condition of the cervix itself . Barrier-free Living In exchange for chemical- and barrier-free contraception , you sacrifice convenience . Natural birth control is more complicated than popping a pill or squirting spermicide into a diaphragm . It requires ( literally ) hands-on knowledge of your body and diligence in charting your temperature , checking for mucous and recognizing changes in your cervix . And because of its complexity , it 's best to take a how-to seminar rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have textbook cycles , " says Katie Singer , 38 , a certified fertility awareness instructor in Santa Fe , N.M . " Some are longer , some are shorter , and mucous patterns can be different from what the textbooks say they should be . A teacher can help you sort through all that . " ( See Resources , p. 91 . ) While the process may seem intimidating at first-many liken it to learning to drive-users say once you learn , it 's as easy as tying your shoes and only takes about five minutes a day . " When you look at the Couple to Couple League instruction manual , it looks like a book on algebra , " says Paul Busam , M.D. , a retired family doctor in Cincinatti , Ohio , and a member of the Couple to Couple League 's board of advisers . " But once people use it , they rapidly lose this fear . For the vast majority of people , it 's not complicated at all . " Still , even the most passionate advocates acknowledge natrual is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use these methods , " cautions Weschler . But the payoffs can be enormous . A New Zealand study published in the Journal of Advances in Contraception ( June 1997 ) found that 90 percent of users were highly satisfied with natural birth control , citing effectiveness , a heightened awareness of their overall health and freedom from drugs as major benefits . Indeed , when women talk about their experiences with natural birth control , the word they often use is empowering . Not only does charting banish what Feldman describes as " monthly crossed-finger anxiety , " it gives a woman a sense that her body belongs to her-not the pharmaceutical industry . " We 're not taught to take account for our own health and well-being , " says Lynn Shelton , 32 , an experimental filmmaker from New York City who 's been using natural birth control for four years . " We 're taught to believe that whatever doctors say must be okay . Learning fertility awareness has completely changed my relationship to my body . There 's something about being able to read what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mystery . " For Singer , going natural provided relief from the endless yeast infections she experienced when she used spermicides and a cervical cap . " I did n't want junk in my body anymore . " She 's been practicing natural birth control for three years and has never been pregnant . Loretta Jordan Jezina , 34 , a Brooklyn , N.Y.-based doula ( a professional who assists with labor and postpartum care ) , found natural birth control a logical extension of her interest in holistic health . " I wanted to be more natural about sex without having any chemical substances in my body or on my husband . " After practicing it for five years , Jezina is convinced it works . " There 's an eight-year difference between my second and third child , " she says . " When I did n't want to get pregnant , I did n't ; when I wanted to , I did . " However , Jezina recalls one nailbiting moment when her normally 24-day cycle suddenly stretched to 31 . " I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started talking about baby names . But I kept telling myself , No , you chart yourself carefully . ' Then I realized I was n't pregnant . I should have trusted myself and my chart . " Trust in her charts kept Lisa Dubnow , 23 , of Boston , from worrying that she was pregnant when her period suddenly went on hiatus . She had just landed a new jot and had two weeks to move herself and her fiance cross-country , find an apartment and start work . The strain threw her cycle of completely . " I knew from prior experience that my ovulation could be delayed by stress-once it was 60 days late , " she says . " I kept taking my temperature , so I knew I had n't ovulated yet . There was the move , the job and where we were going to live . But I did n't have to worry that I was pregnant . " Anecdotes aside , how reliable is it ? Proponents of natural birth control say very-if you follow the rules . And that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each month when it 's possible to conceive . " This method is unforgiving of mistakes , " says Weschler , who 's used it for 17 years , has no children and has never experienced an unintended pregnancy . Numerous scientifically accepted studies have tried to determine natural birth control 's pregnancy prevention rate . The Couple to Couple League lists several studies on its Web site that boast of a 98 percent to 99 percent effectiveness rate ( only total abstinence is completely reliable ) . A 1980 study by the World Health Organization yielded similar results : a 97.5 percent effectiveness rate for women who used natural birth control for one year and abstained during their fertile periods . It stands to reason : If sperm does n't meet egg , you ca n't get pregnant . Nonetheless , it 's tricky stuff to measure accurately . Other studies have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness : A 1979 study by the U.S. Department of Health , Education and Welfare , for example , found that , combined , the temperature and mucous methods were 90 percent effective ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The journal Family Planning Perspectives reports that natural birth control users who adhere strictly to the rules and abstain during the fertile period have an 89 percent chance of avoiding pregnancy . One explanation for the discrepancies is that unlike the pill , there 's no such thing as a true control group with natural birth control . Because researchers ca n't camp out in the bedroom , they must rely on participants to follow the rules and " fess up if they break them . Some do n't . And that , of course , throws off the numbers . " Pregnancy rates during typical use of natural birth control are high even though pregnancy rates during perfect use are low , " says James Trussell , Ph.D. , director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University in N.J. This is a subject Trussell knows well . The co-author of Contraceptive Technology ( Bridging the Gap Communications , 1998 ) , Trussell is the man the U.S. Food and Drug Administration relies on to provide the failure rates that must accompany every contraceptive manufacturer 's package inserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control methods work well , " he says . " But people do n't always use them correctly and consistently . Taking just a few chances can entail a high risk of pregnancy . " " The major cause of unplanned pregnancy in natural family planning is not related to a woman 's inability to determine her fertile period , but to someone 's inability to abstain during the fertile period , " explains Jeffrey Spieler , chief of research in the Office of Population at the Center for Population Health and Nutrition in Washington , D.C. " If you abstain during the fertile period , you have somewhere around a half a percent to 3 percent chance over one year of getting pregnant , depending on which study you choose to believe . But in actual practice , some 20 percent who use natural birth control experience an unplanned pregnancy . Somewhere around 3 percent can be explained by the method not working . As for the rest , they just did n't abstain on a day they knew they were fertile . " Or they relied on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break and diaphragms slip . According to Contraceptive Technology , when used perfectly , diaphragms with spermicide have a 6 percent failure rate ; used improperly , the failure rate shoots up to 20 percent . Used correctly , condoms ( without spermicide ) have a 3 percent failure rate ; used incorrectly , you 're gambling with 14 percent . " If a couple chooses to use a diaphragm during the fertile period , then the protection is only as effective as the effective rates for a diaphragm , " Weschler emphasizes . " If you abstain , it can be as high as 98 percent . It really comes down to what people choose to do during the fertile period . " So when couples follow the **27;54;TOOLONG rule , how does natural birth control stack up against the more popular contraceptives ? Comparing perfect-use rates , Spieler says , the hormone-based contraceptives , the IUD and sterilization are hands-down more effective . But , he adds , natural birth control " stands up well against the condom , diaphragm and spermicides . We would consider it highly effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more caveat : " Active intercourse at the extremes of the fertile period may result in a pregnancy even if you think you 're covered . " The Flip Side Some women use natural birth control for the exact opposite reason . Knowledge used to avoid conception also can be used to conceive . Lori Johnson , 36 , a New York City actor , has used natural birth control for 12 years and has a 7-year-old son . " He was planned , " she says . " We knew we could be making a baby . It was great to know that . " Lynn Shelton is hoping the same thing will happen to her . " When I stopped taking the pill , I wanted to get pregnant , but I did n't have a period for 14 months , " she says . Charting her cycles helped her understand her body 's process . " I was driving myself crazy . I have long cycles , and I 'd go through scads of pregnancy tests because my period was n't coming . I thought I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have known I was n't ovulating until day 35 . When you 're trying to get pregnant , and you ca n't , it can be really difficult emotionally . But there 's something comforting about being able to note the cervical fluid and temperatures and jot it all down . Maybe because I 'm detail-oriented , it 's been extremely comforting to me . " Added bonus : Those who practice natural birth control say it fosters greater intimacy and communication between couples because both partners are keenly aware of where the woman is in her cycle . Lisa Brand , 38 , of Harrison Township , Ind. , who has three children and teaches natural family planning with her husband , Jeff , for the Couple to Couple League , says it 's improved her marriage . " The birth control issue is not just on me , " she says . " Jeff takes my temperature and reads my charts daily . We talk about this month to month . Initially , we looked at natural family planning as another method of birth control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a team thing , " affirms Busam . " He knows when she 's fertile , she knows when she 's fertile . That 's one of the beauties of natural family planning . Most methods of birth control are aimed at the woman , but the man should be just as involved in it . " Spreading the Word So why , in light of such ringing endorsements , has there not been a rush of women trading in their pill packs and diaphragms for charts and basal thermometers ? The problem may be a substantial lack of upto-date , informed PR . " Natural birth control is not presented as an option often enough , " observes Laurie Aesoph , N.D. , a naturopathic physician in Sioux Falls , S.D. , and author of Your Natural Health Makeover ( Prentice Hall , 1998 ) . " Doctors are n't educated and women are n't aware of it . " " It 's not taught in medical schools , " adds Weschler . " It 's unbelievable that something as basic and fundamental as this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be some doctor elitism at play . " Often physicians do n't think women can recognize the signs easily and identify them correctly , " says BOMA 's Kay Ek . Thus , natural options are often not even part of the birth control discussion . And then there 's the profit motive . " Who makes money off of women 's knowledge ? " Weschler asks rhetorically . " Who 's motivated to disseminate information if there 's no money to be made ? " And yet a handful of companies have discovered a way to capitalize on women 's interest in natural birth control by producing devices that make determining the fertile period easier for the average user . Ovu-tec , manufactured by Gennex Healthcare Technologies in Ocala , Fla. , is a lipstick-size instrument that tracks hormonal changes through the saliva . Persona , made by the British company Unipath , Ltd. , is a combination dipstick urine test and palm-size computer that monitors hormone changes . Green lights signal infertile days ; red lights , fertile days ; a yellow light indicates the computer needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to decide whether it 's a green day or a red day . Persona is currently undergoing clinical trials in the United States and wo n't be available until at least the year 2000 . The marketing of these products , and others like them , is a strong indication that natural birth control is a concept whose time may have come . Society 's fascination for all things natural is growing exponentially . Just witness the herbs , supplements , natural beauty products and organic foods that now crowd the shelves of even mainstream stores , as well as the growing acceptance of alternative health therapies by practitioners of conventional medicine . Given this atmosphere , it seems appropriate that natural birth control would start to become a real option for women seeking a safe , effective , chemical-free method that puts them in control of their bodies . " Women have known how to do this since the beginning of time , " says Johnson . " We just forgot to tell each other for a while . I never knew this . None of my sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we 're rediscovering these things for ourselves . It 's so wonderful . " Norine Dworkin- is senior articles editor of Vegetarian Times . Sidebar NOTE : Natural forms of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) or HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . If you are sexually active , you must use a condom to prevent STDs and HIV. // <p>
