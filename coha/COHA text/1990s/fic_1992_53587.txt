THE FIELD WAS TOUGH and springy ; my feet went down , went forward and came back under me ; I was not afraid of holes . I felt very light , and a little better than usual , even . When I was a boy , in the summer , and the snow melted off the lower part of the Range , under our cabin , I used to go down to where there was a field , a field that was like a road , though nobody had made it or used it , and run , the first day I got the snowshoes off my feet . I was so used to them that it was hard to believe I was n't still lifting them step by step , and slowed way down from even normal walking . But after the thaw I 'd go down and run with just my feet , and the whole land  --  the flat and the mountains to one side , and everything I could see  --  speeded up , and I really took off . I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest-moving , the fastest-thinking , the most free human there was : and freer than that , freer than any lynx , any mallard , any salmon or tern or bufflehead . I would n't be able to tell you that I could n't fly ; that would be next . Going over ground so fast , and so free that it was wrong , except that I liked it so much , was so different from moving over snow I wished every year for a few minutes that it would never snow again , or that we could move off the Brooks Range and live somewhere else . But when the snow came back I was ready , and happy to get back on the shoes , where I belonged . There 's too much easiness in just running on your feet . It 's dangerous . The snowshoes are solid , solid-down : they give you a balance you ought to have . <p> But now I was running just in my GI boots , and over the field I had the summer feeling ; I had the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch myself , and slow down before I went much farther . The smoke was beginning to sting my eyes bad ; I was going right into it . As nearly as I could tell , two streets came together at the edge of the field , and every time the smoke shifted I could tell that there were plenty of people there , not going back and forth but all moving one way ; they kept crowding past , to my right ; I could hear them , a long moaning sound they all made together , and a sharp scream like a bird , or more like a trapped rabbit , rising out of it when I was listening to the other . I slowed down until I was almost walking , and then saw that would n't do , because all of them were running , or trying to run , even if the whole movement of the crowd was slow , even slower than they would have been going on snowshoes . I picked up to a jog , because I wanted to get in amongst them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blend in . <p> I was n't there yet , though . I was maybe seventy-five yards from the people in the crowd nearest me , though I could n't say that was exactly how far . The wind would shift back and forth and clear the view for a few seconds , and then the smoke would thicken up and I had to guess . The smoke did n't act like any smoke I had ever seen , and I listened more , the nearer I got to the streets . In amongst the long moaning of the people there were low heavy crumps , like a rifle shot with a blanket around the barrel . This was the three-hundred-plane raid , all right ; this was it . The more I listened the more I could hear the incendiaries hitting , all behind the crowds in the street . Then all at once I felt my back warm up , a heavy slash of heat , and I turned around towards the docks . All up and down where I had been was on fire , partly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white phosphorus , which is not so much like any fire you 'd know , but was more like the end of a blowtorch , all spread out and shooting up curlicues and wriggles of itself like tracers that had gone crazy , and were meant to . <p> Even in the situation I was in , I could n't get over the smoke : the way the smoke acted . In a low red light that was all over everything before I even realized it was there , the smoke would all of a sudden stir itself , whirl around and cut one way or the other ; it would jog and slant , and settle , then jump and swirl again and go the other way , or come right at me . The incendiaries were hitting everywhere , in front of me and on both sides , but nothing else behind me ; there was no more heat on my back . Now , though , as I got closer to the streets , whenever the smoke would blast one way or the other with the bombs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not something the smoke was doing to itself  --  I could see fire , low fire , buildings and not just white phosphorus twisting in the air , down the street I would be on if I kept running , and came off the field and did n't turn . <p> Through the blasts of smoke I got into the crowd , making the turn to be in their direction and slowing down to their pace , which was a kind of fast shuffle . I could n't tell much about the people , even the ones that were right next to me , except that they were women , a couple of them with babies . There was one old man bent over like a squirrel ; I just caught a glimpse of him and his thin long mustache and then he went down under all of us , and we went on over him , on past him . <p> The smoke in front of us stopped , stopped dead and then came back and hit us square , face-on . Then I was on top of somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , or maybe two . I rolled a woman  --  I 'm sure  --  to one side and got my feet under me . The others were getting up , and it bothered me that I might have stood up too quick , and would show my difference , even in all the confusion . The new fire was right in front of us , on both sides of the street , and all of a sudden I looked down , because there was something wrong . The zipper of my flight suit caught the light , and caught it strong just for a second , and without any pain I had the notion that I had been gutted , ripped right down the middle by fire , by lightning maybe , and that I was dead from it ; that I had come out on the other side alive with another kind of life , still holding the print . I bent down again , and got up slow with the others . Nobody had noticed a thing . We started , and turned off into another street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the crowd around me was made up of high yells , all you could put up with , but around them all was the low sound , which must have been coming from the whole city . How all those high screams could have added up to that one low tone , like a glacier when it first begins to calve off , was not something I could explain ; it must have had something to do with the buildings , echoes ; all those voices beat back and forth off the walls . Maybe , but I do n't know . <p> On the second street the smoke was bad ; even worse than on the other one , and for the first time I noticed how terrific the heat was ; and steady , not just near the fires we could see . I kept as close as I could to the woman in front of me  --  for a while it was the same one  --  so that my zipper would n't show in the flames , but I knew I had better do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as I was able , and I started to figure , in there shuffling with the rest of them , sweating like a thaw , and adding up what I had with me . <p> I am a great believer in tape , and now I was sure glad I was . My bread knife was riding down my leg , almost a part of me , just as much in place as it had been in the Quonset hut back at Tinian , and the emergency kit was square in the middle of my chest , breathing with me , and ready to do all the things it could do , from cutting wire to stripping down vines and cleaning fish . I had my .45 and one extra clip , and that was something I could use in what I needed to do ; wanted to do , you might even say . It was one of those kinds of times . And there was a war on , too , as the Colonel and everybody else used to tell us . That was all right with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plenty of doors , some that shut on the street and some that went back a ways . I was interested in the deep ones , and I looked along the left for what I wanted . There was hardly any sidewalk , and I could be in one of the doorways in two pushes and one big step , or two at the most . There were a couple of men in the crowd , now , on the side I was edging toward . They were ahead of me , but one of them was about my size , and I figured that there would be more than one to come along later , when I was ready . And I had noticed something else . A lot of the people , even the babies , had things , some kind of bandages , over their noses and mouths , like doctors in hospitals ; like some of the ones at the base hospital at Buckingham Field , when I was in there for the trench mouth I got from eating GI food ; I used to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only now but later on . The officers in Indoctrination , in the course we had to take called " The Nature of the Enemy , " told us that a lot of Japanese wore those things all the time , even when they were not in an air raid . And , again , I knew that would help , and that there was more advantage I could give myself , once I had picked out the door . <p> And there it was , so deep it might have been an alley . I slid and slanted and jumbled over through the women , and then made my two steps , one big and the other more or less ordinary , and I was in . I backed up some more to get the shadow , and got it all , all I could use . There was plenty of time now . Plenty of time , and good conditions . <p> I felt my face . I had shaved before the mission as I always did , because the oxygen mask fits a lot better that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But that was not what I was thinking . I ran my fingers along the wood next to me and looked at them , and the tips were black ; the smoke had sooted up everything . I took a good smear of soot off the boards and went across my forehead with it ; then more down my cheeks and nose and around my mouth . As the color of my face disappeared and went to another color there was something inside me that changed , too ; it moved , and then sat still ; in my mind there was a shape I could n't exactly make out , but it seemed to be in a crouch , pulled up into itself and ready , and that was the feeling I got from the soot , the stronger the more I put on . I did the back of my hands the same way , and then concentrated on the crowd going by , screaming and moaning , and not one of them even giving a flicker of a look toward me ; millions of them could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen me . I was dark now , the same as the shadow I was in . Some of the people were pretty smudged-up , too , but I had not made myself like them in any way ; it was just that now I would n't stand out . I was not like them , I say again ; like something else . <p> I had another thought . Working with little moves , I pulled out the blood-chit , the silk handkerchief with the American flag on it , and all the languages  --  Japanese was one of them , which I could n't get over  --  that said that my aircraft was destroyed , I was an enemy of the Japanese , that my government would pay anybody who 'd help me . I turned the flag and the writing to the inside , and tied it around the lower part of my face . Almost everybody I saw had on a mask or cloth , and now I had mine . <p> It was time . I zipped down the flight suit and took the .45 out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel of my other hand to make sure it was seated , and then let the safety off and charged it , and at the same time I brought the crouching shape up front in my mind , and had what it wanted me to have . There was not a flicker of light on the gun barrel . I put my free hand on the wood next to me to get steady , and all at once the wood jumped and shook . I figured the second story had caught fire , or somewhere up above me had , but I could n't see for the smoke . On the other side of the street the fire had already come down to the ground floor ; I could tell by the crowd edging toward me . In there amongst the people , and close to me , I looked for my size . <p> About five yards from me someone  --  a man , I think  --  went down . The crowd went over him . He tried to get up , but before he could make it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither one got up . Out of the smoke another man stumbled , and in a second I knew he was about right , about what I needed . For some reason the two that should have been on the ground were not there , maybe had been shoved off to one side by all that panic , all that pressure , but the one I had my eye on was still stumbling where they had been , correcting , you might say , trying to get his feet all the way under him , and I let him have a couple more steps . He came right to me , like every animal or bird I 'd ever shot , or like the Nip fighters , sliding down the string of the pursuit curve . If you want to kill something , have it coming toward you . If it comes without knowing you 're there , it 's the best way of all . I stood up in the doorway and came up with the .45 , and shot him right straight into the face , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the clothes , or any holes . The sound of the gun was hardly any louder than the general noise , and the muzzle flame was just one more little bit of fire , exactly like all the rest of it , and gone quicker than you could think . <p> The blast knocked him back , the shock  --  a .45 at close range is like a hand-held .30-06  --  and he went down , with the two or three other people behind him . I doubled into a crouch , watching hard . The others scrambled back into the crowd and left him ; all but one guy , who pulled him to one side , and then moved with the others again . The clothes I wanted were lying about half under the feet of the people on my side of the street . He had been dragged a yard or two by his feet , and I could n't see his head ; the others were swarming all over him , to get on . Nobody Burned back . <p> I holstered the .45 , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those feet ; they were going by me like they were going by the dead man . I took him by an arm and a leg and hiked him up on my shoulders , like I was maybe going to carry him on with the rest of the crowd , wherever they were going . But all I did was take two or three steps and lurch back into my door , then rolled him off and rolled down beside him . <p> I stayed there still as I could , then reached a hand . The building was roaring over us , and pieces of wood , some of them big and heavy , were falling faster and faster , and I thought that maybe the whole thing was going to come down on us in the next few seconds . I hoisted up to my knees and took hold of the middle of myself , under the throat , pulled down the zipper in one sweep , came out of the flight suit in a couple of moves , and started pulling off the dead guy 's coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wearing them over my dungarees was not too tight . The pants were good enough , too , but the shoes were too short ; I could n't come near getting one of them on , sitting in the doorframe now like I was doing , not too much different from the way I would have back in the Quonset hut . <p> I stood up , and took one last look at the guy . The top half of his head was gone , but with the fire flickering on him and the ground-smoke swirling in and out of the door , he did n't look too bad , right then . His hat had been blown off with his head , so I would have to do without it , but I had a crew cut anyway , and my hair is black , so it did n't make all that much difference . It would not be a bad idea to have a hat later on , and some other shoes , but I knew I could n't stay where I was any longer . The building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I balled my flight suit up and slung it into the fire . Nobody was going to look at my feet . Breathing through the blood-chit , the American flag , I stepped out . <p> It did n't take me long to pick up the kind of shuffle-stumble the crowd was moving with , screaming and moaning . For some reason all of us turned a corner , away from the docks , and just as we did there was a crash inside all the other noises  --  a terrific crash inside the big moaning sound the whole city must have been making  --  and a building fell in . Whether it was the one I had been in I ca n't say , and it does n't make any difference , but I think it probably was . People kept shoving in from the side streets , and we were pushed closer and closer together . It was hard enough to breathe through the smoke , but all that being pressed on made it a lot harder . For a spell , there , I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and the rest of them would just carry me along . It would be better for me to work myself out to the near edge , on the side I had come in from , but still stay amongst them , and not separate myself out , even if I 'd been able to . <p> I managed it , and could breathe better . There was only a little fat woman between me and the buildings , and a short , screaming man in front ; whoever was behind me I did n't need to know . <p> Over the knife and the emergency kit and the .45 I had on somebody 's old shirt and coat . They were loose and comfortable . The pants fit all right , too , but they had a pocket only on the right side , and no pockets in the back . I was holding the extra clip for the gun in my hand , and I put it in the pocket , which was deep , real deep . I had everything but shoes , and I planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bag like the ones a lot of people in the crowd were carrying . I was going to have to take everything I needed with me , and when I got out of the fire and into the cold I 'd have to be able to keep warm enough to stay alive . But even when I got to the real cold  --  cold like the Brooks Range  --  I would n't need clothes as heavy as most people would have to wear . Still , it would be better if I could find some heavier than the ones I had on . Actually , I looked forward to getting hold of a parka somewhere ; that would be like home , sure enough . As I shuffled along with the little screaming people , breathing through the blood-chit , the American flag , my eyes almost shut with smoke , I thought about the parka . I 'd like it to be one with wolverine fur around the head , because ice does n't hold to the hairs ; all you have to do is brush it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any parkas in Japan , but if people lived in the northern part , on the big island the map said was up above the one where I was , they 'd have to have the clothes for it . And if there were animals up there they 'd have to have fur , and the humans would 've found a way to get it . But wolverines ? Again , I did n't know . Wolverine fur was maybe a little too much to hope for , but it was n't costing me anything to think about it , or about how I would get it if I found it . I had n't counted on any of the other stuff that had happened , either : that my B-29 would get the ass knocked off it , or that I would bail out , get hung up on a crane , or that I would hide in a sewer pipe full of half the shit in Tokyo , or shoot somebody for his pants and coat , or join up with a bunch of little people trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . who knows ? I said to myself . Who knows I wo n't find a wolverine parka , up north of here ? Who could want anything better ? <p> I thought of my father , then , too . He was good for me ; he had taught me everything I knew , until I was old enough to teach him . The day that happened was the best day of my life , I can tell you . It was not when I took off my snowshoes and ran the flat of the valley , but the day I put them back on , and knew there was going to be nothing but snow for a long time . <p> I had n't been keeping track of the direction of the mob I was in , but just moved along with the others . After a while , though , I started to notice something I could n't see any reason for . The crowd seemed to know where it was going , like way off in front there might be somebody leading the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there seemed to be a general direction we were headed in . Twice buildings fell in front of us , one no more than fifty or sixty yards off , and both times we turned into another street , and then back toward the way we had been headed . I thought we might be trying to get out of the city , but we just went on and on , and the buildings on both sides were just as close together as they had been down by the docks . <p> And then things changed , all at once . The wind was steady now , coming from behind us like it was pushing us along ; the smoke was as bad as ever , but it blew forward past me . People stepped away from both sides , and I could tell that the shape of the crowd that had been made by the streets and buildings was not the shape any longer . There was not a whole lot more room , but there was some ; nobody was shoved against me . I was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , as near as I could tell , and they were moving a little faster , like something they had been looking for was in sight . I could n't figure how any of this could be , or how any of them could see any better than I could , so I fell back on what I could hear , and tried to tune in on any new sound , through that low long moaning that just went on and on . <p> Sure enough , there was something . I thought it could n't be what it sounded like , but when I saw the one  --  the man  --  in front of me get shorter and shorter , and not fall , I knew that he was moving downward , and that he was walking into water . I followed him down , and in . <p> The water was not much cooler than the air , but the crowd had quit moving , most of them . The people around me were just standing and screaming . If they had walked into that lake , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scream as loud as they could , for money or some prize , they could n't have done it any better , or any louder , or got more breath out of all that smoke to keep it up like they did . I waded through them , with the idea that the water farther out might not be as hot . Some of them were trying to hold the others up  --  not all these were kids , either  --  and some were trying to push the others down and get on top of them . There were piles of people everywhere ; they 'd build up a little and then everything would fall apart and go under water . I did n't believe that many of them could swim , but some of them were moving out from the shore like I was , hoping for water the fire was n't so close to . <p> The water was about up to the middle of my chest when I stepped in a hole and went under . I came right back up , though , and leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in front of me , and not turned the same way I was . She was looking right at me , right into my face . I felt of myself : the blood-chit had come down , and was around my neck . The soot had maybe washed off me , too , or most of it . It was the first face I had looked at since I 'd bailed out , and the first person who had looked at me close up . Even through the smoke there was plenty of light , and she could n't believe what she was looking at ; my face must have been real pale in all that red glow . Her mouth opened and she screamed , and started to raise her hand to point . She did scream , but the sound was not any different from all the others , and she did n't scream but once . Underwater I ran the knife into her with one move . The blade hit bone and traveled around it , and the only thing that stopped my hand was her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case , and was holding her down pretty hard as quick as anybody could have done it . But after a second or two I could tell there was not any reason to hold her down , and I turned loose and moved on , pulling the chit up where it belonged . <p> The water was not cooler , no matter where I went . When it got up to my chin I stopped ; there was no use to swim , just to be swimming . Besides , I was worried about the .45 . I might be able to use it again before it had a chance to rust , but I had better do it in the next hour or so . The bullets were probably all right , but I was n't sure about them , either . If I had to depend on a gun I wanted to know that it would fire when I used it . If it would n't , or even if there was any doubt , I would get rid of it and use the rest of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather do that anyway . Not having a gun would n't bother me at all ; I would n't miss it nearly as much as I would have the knife , or the compass , or even the fishhooks . I started working back through the stacks of people , and the ones just standing and screaming toward the shore , and the crowd that thought that water would do them any good . <p> I had got used to panic . It was what I had wanted when I was in the pipe , and was what I had to go on from the Colonel 's briefing , and all his talk about what three hundred 29 's were going to do to Tokyo , as he said , within a week . I remembered my time in the pipe , and the Tokyo shit going past where I was hunkered down thinking about the caribou clearing the tree line into the winter range , and the ice calving off the berg in a slide , freeing up that big blue window that did n't have anything behind it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color that 's not anywhere but there , I would bet anything on earth  --  all that time , all that time hunkered down in the pipe , with the shit going past me and falling into the bay , I had been pulling for the fire raid , the fire-storm and the panic . Wading out of the water now  --  the bay or lake or river or whatever it was  --  I felt that panic , that whole city-panic , and in the water it was different from what it was in the streets and the smoke . It was heavy-electric-and to tell the truth I do n't know exactly what I mean by this , but it was a feeling , and maybe one of those that do n't have words  --  and in the legs : in my legs but it felt good , coming from all those other people ; it was in the guts and the balls , and that was the best of all . <p> While I was in the water I did n't do anything but enjoy it , but when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed when you do n't want to ; sleep holds to you , and your position and your feeling is so good that it seems wrong to change it . But I needed shoes . I needed some shoes like theirs , and a bag , and I started to think again . <p> It did n't bother anybody that I was moving the opposite way from the others , going toward the fire . I probably did n't need to , but I stumbled a little , even waved my arms , like I was drunk , or maybe like the fire had got me in the lungs , or that the whole thing , the fire-storm , was more than I could cope with , and had driven me off my nut . I went face-forward through the crowd coming toward the water , going back to the main smoke and the fire like I 'd lost something there : something or somebody  --  some damned thing . <p> I made it back into the streets , went up a block through the bunches of people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was hardly anybody there , maybe because it was so goddamned hot , hotter than anywhere else I 'd been . While I could , I figured to blacken up again , and I did , from the closest house to me , just wherever I happened to be . I took my time and made myself up pretty good , better than before , if I do say so . I did n't need to see a mirror ; I could feel how thick the stuff was on my face and hands , how heavy it was , how much of it I put on me ; I kept putting on the black , the soot ; I kept putting on the smoke . It was like getting back into something I knew ' something that was right for me , only a lot better version of it than before . All I needed now was shadows , because I was as much like them as I could ever have wanted to be : shadows I needed . I would get the shoes from them . <p> I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and that way up the street . But the pipe kept coming back to me ; I could n't shake it , or the feeling that what I had said there , said to myself , and on out the black-blue opening of the sewer out onto the ocean , had been picked up : picked up by the crews and everybody who was connected with putting those B-29 's up there over the town . I had called for that fire , from a place where I was as good as buried ; I had called that fire down . Damn right . If I did n't , who did ? <p> I kept looking for people , for somebody with fair-size feet and a bag . It was so hot that it was just possible to stand it . I thought that maybe if it got any hotter my clothes would burn , wet as they were . But nothing like that happened , and I started forward into the smoke and the bad  --  the worst  --  heat because I figured I could catch somebody there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away . That was the right street , if I could stand it . <p> The buildings on the left were burning worse than the right  --  my black left hand was a lot hotter than my right  --  and all at once , like some acrobat  --  a clown maybe : clumsy , but an acrobat  --  a man shot out of a second-story window on the right , went across the street over me , and crashed through a window on the other side . Nobody will believe this , but it happened . In all the noise and smoke this guy just appeared in a blast of sparks like about fifty shotguns at midnight , like the kind of thing you see made into slow-motion by a movie , and went right over the street into another building ; the window he went through buried him in sparks  --  other sparks , but the same . I ca n't get over the way that happened : he turned over in the air , like he was just learning how to do it , and then hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really went ; for a second it was slow , when he made the turnover , but really how he moved was fast , real fast and interesting , unexpected ; it was not something you 'd see every day . " Hurtled " would be the word ; I ca n't do any better . <p> I went on under where he had been , and I could n't help smiling , under the chit , the American colors , when I caught myself looking up , to see whether there 'd be any more coming over : the rest of the act , the other guy shot out of the building , the gun . Gun , you bet , that was it : coming over me in the sparks of a shotgun . <p> It was bad , though . I thought about heading back , maybe picking up another street , but the good happened , right then . Two guys , one bigger than me and one smaller , came toward me ; the clothes of the little one looked like they might have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his left arm was burning . I let him go by , and then stepped out , right in front of the other one . It was important to do it that way , with just him and me . I pulled the .45 and leveled it right in his chest . Shoes , you son of a bitch . Shoes . I squeezed off . <p> Nothing happened . I did n't even bother to try again ; I was on him with the knife in a second , hit him once and hit him right , and was already dragging him before he was dead . <p> I wiped the knife off on his pants and unlaced his shoes and mine , sitting there in the shadows cooking , both of us , like meat not quite close enough to the fire to get done . But it was not bad , either , in a way . There was something coming through me that the fire could n't touch , and a lot of times later on , I 've thought about it : remembering that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot rocks  --  or maybe cement  --  of a street , pulling on the shoes that were going to walk all over hell , and walk right out of it , and on : and on and on , up into the snow . I wanted that tree line ; I wanted that move into the winter range , with the caribou . There never had been such real snow as was in my mind right then , pulling on those shoes . Snow , man , I said : snow and the north star , Polaris . Snow and the icebergs , and the ocean when it 's what it really is , like I had told the guy , the recruit in the barracks . I he ocean is not the ocean unless it 's got ice in it . That 's the real one . And that 's the truth . <p> I stood up to see whether the guy had anything else I could use . I had forgotten about the bag I needed , but damned if he did n't have one , a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of musical instrument , I guess it was , and a short knife with a long handle , which I did n't figure to use but kept anyway . I put my GI boots in the bag , picked up the waterlogged .45 , and pitched it and the two extra clips into the fire . I was glad to see them go , to tell the truth . <p> I went on up the same street . It had had what I needed , and I pushed on , though the heat was so terrific that I did n't really see how anybody could live . I did n't hear any more bombs , though , and figured the raid was over . Tokyo did n't need any more fire , and probably would n't see any more until the end of everything . It was so hot that I kept looking at the arms of the coat I had on to see when they 'd take fire . And then it got hotter , goddamn it , and hotter than that . I did n't think my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . I thought I would take fire , myself , inside the clothes , and that the clothes , shoes and all , would burn up after I did . <p> The street ended into a wall , and that 's what saved me , I guess , because I would have gone on ; I know I would have . A strange thing to say , but I was more or less happy with what I had , and the thing that made me the happiest was that I had got rid of the .45 and the clips , and that I had an excuse for getting rid of them . At the wall I turned to the right , which I figured was more or less north . The pull that way was not real strong , then , but it was definite . I could have checked the compass , I guess , but I went by the feel . Like I say , it was definite ; the smoke and fire could n't touch it . I moved along for a couple of blocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my singed clothes and my new shoes , and opened the bag again : I opened the bag I had . <p> The knife was a pretty little knife , there in the flicker . The handle was long , and with a kind of string-weave around it , and there was carving at the end of it . It was strange , though . For such a short blade the handle was a lot too long . It was more like the handle that should have been on a sword  --  one of their swords , that they swing with both hands  --  instead of a blade that size . The steel was stiff , which I did n't like , but the blade was so short that flex probably would n't have done any good ; you need a long blade for flex to do its stuff . I had put down two people with my bread knife , like I knew I could , and neither one of them had made a sound , or at least any that I could hear . That ought to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the pull and the feeling . I guessed some , too ; I wo n't tell you that I did n't . As nearly as I could tell , though , I was working crossways through the main push of people , all of them going for the water . It made sense to them , I guess , though I 'd reckon as many drowned as were burned up . The water seemed to turn them against each other , and a lot of them held the other ones down and tried to get on top for a second . That was a bad mistake , I could have told them : those poor bastards trying to stand on top of their own kids , just for one more breath . What if they 'd got it ? <p> I was surprised at how tired I was , there on another street , and then another one . I knew I had better get out of the city and hole up somewhere , because I felt the worst of the panic  --  the part that was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  felt it from where I was now  --  and I thought that maybe I should try to sleep some , and build up . You watch any animal hunt  --  look at a lynx , for one  --  and they come right out of sleeping into hunting ; that 's the time to do it . You do n't want any tiredness to get into it , because it all has to happen so fast . I wanted that quick , that quickness . I wanted the quick whenever I could get it . <p> But I sat down again , anyway , and opened the bag . The instrument , whatever it was , was round , round as a wheel , and the strings , which were real tight , caught the fire , caught off the flames in the low part of the building I was sitting against , and I thought , What the hell , why not see what the thing sounds like . So I hit one of the strings , and bent over to listen to it . You 'd have thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low way , off those black bricks and boards , and there might have been something in that ; I admit it . I hit that string , and then the next one to it , and then both of them together . You could tell that that was not the way they were supposed to sound  --  or I more or less supposed that anybody who knew 'd be able to tell , because I had not ever heard anything like it , quite . It was a tinny kind of noise , and it had something in it  --  if I could put it like this  --  that was like the singing somebody would make way back in his mouth , between his throat and his nose ; it was like that , except that the person would have to be young , like a kid , like a real young girl . Well , I hit all the strings then , one after the other , and this time it bothered me , because it was a sound  --  whether it was music or somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go anywhere ; it just hung there and made you dissatisfied . I put the thing in the bag , but when I did I knew that I would probably fool with it again , somewhere between me and the snow , and that maybe would not be such a good thing to be doing , so I took it out and leaned it against the place I 'd been sitting , to add one more thing to the night ; one more thing that there would n't be any way to explain . There were going to be a lot of things like that in Tokyo , after the fire quit burning . But it would have been the strangest of all , I reckon , if somebody had seen me sitting there in the smoke , twanging on that little white wheel . They would have told the others , maybe  --  whoever lived  --  but nobody would 've believed it . Or maybe somebody would have . Like I say , it was one of those nights . <p> I got up and went on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or try to make  --  somewhere in my throat , something like that last sound , the one that could have been a lot of voices , all young , and maybe all girls . They were in me somewhere , and would n't have been there except for that little wheel with the strings on it , round as a full moon , with a rack of tin along through it . I could n't get that sound , but I could hear it ; I knew it was there , and that maybe I 'd get it later on , when I went through the tree line , or saw the ocean with ice in it that made the whole thing the truth , as real as it could get . <p> <p> By JAMES DICKEY <p>
