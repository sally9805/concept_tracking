<p> If the suburban highway begat station wagons and supermarkets in the 1950 's , might the information highway of the 90 's portend the supermarket 's demise ? <p> On a Sunday afternoon , it is grocery shopping time for Kay Orsatti , a business consultant in this Boston suburb who has no time for such tasks on a weekday . But instead of heading out to the supermarket , she heads upstairs to her study . <p> There , she loads a CD-ROM into her personal computer and begins browsing the virtual shelves of Shop link Inc. , one of a handful of companies intent on realizing the full technological  --  and for the first time , profitable  --  potential of the on-line grocery business . Within 15 minutes , Ms. Orsatti will have ordered $130 worth of grocery items , which Shop link will deliver under a system that requires neither she nor her husband Lou , a marketing and advertising executive , to be at home . <p> The convenience of ordering groceries by computer is nothing new , of course . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the on-line grocery business since 1989 and now has 44,000 customers around the country , using a system in which a computerized order is hand-filled by someone who pushes a cart up and down the aisles of a Safeway or other Peapod-affiliated supermarket . <p> But even though it is making its initial public offering of stock , Peapod has never had a profitable quarter and lost $9 million last year on sales of $22 million . <p> That 's why a new generation of companies like Shoplink contend that turning this consumer convenience into a money maker will require totally bypassing supermarkets  --  and their high manual labor costs  --  by automating the ordering , warehousing , distribution and delivery of food to American households . <p> Instead of the 14 times that a can of tuna changes hands between the food-packing factory and the customer 's can opener in the typical supermarket distribution process , companies like Shoplink want to use software , networks and warehouse automation to reduce the tuna can 's turnover to 11 pairs of hands or fewer  --  saving time and money at each omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what this on-line shopping-and-delivery concept is called . Last year an Andersen Consulting study sponsored by 18 companies including Coca Cola , Gillette , RJR Nabisco and Procter &; Gamble concluded that consumer-direct distribution could grow into an $85 billion market within 10 years , siphoning off perhaps 10 percent of the market now served by supermarkets and similar retailers . <p> " Nineteen ninety-seven is a key year for this channel , " said Fred Schneider , director of the Andersen study . " It 's a channel that 's been in formation for a long time and people are beginning to crack the code  --  not only on what consumers are demanding , but what it will take to be profitable . " <p> When Ms. Orsatti mouse-clicks her way through Shoplink 's offerings , the produce , packaged goods , and health and beauty aids are all there ( some with pictures ) , with sizes and prices clearly marked . As she reaches soups , a Campbell 's video ad begins playing . Impatient , she clicks it off  --  though she does select a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete , she dials into Shoplink 's on-line network and transmits it to Shoplink headquarters in the nearby suburb of Westwood . Shoplink could make the delivery within a few hours . But Ms. Orsatti , one of 100 customers testing Shoplink 's service before it opens to the broader public late this year , wants to devote no more of her weekend to unpacking or even thinking about groceries . <p> So at her request , the order will be deposited in the Orsatti 's locked garage sometime the following Tuesday  --  the one day she knows that either she or her husband will be home early enough to bring in and unpack the groceries . <p> The Shoplink driver will let himself into the garage by entering a code into a keypad lock . The order will be left in plastic " chill containers " to keep perishables fresh for up to 36 hours . Though the Orsattis have not requested any additional services this time , in the past they have used their computer to instruct Shop link to pick up and return dry cleaning , drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple can seldom find time for themselves . <p> Robert J. Crowell is the 45-year-old chairman and founder of Elcom International , a publicly traded company that sells $850 million worth of personal computers and PC paraphernalia on line each year and is the parent company of Shoplink . And he has big plans . <p> Mr. Crowell hopes eventually to expand beyond metropolitan Boston to pour $200 million into building a nationwide home shopping service , with eight regional distribution centers , a fleet of 6,000 vehicles , and an army of drivers clad in pressed Shoplink uniforms that he hopes will become as recognizable and trusted as Fedex or U.P.S . attire . <p> " People are always skeptical , " Mr. Crowell said . " When Fedex started , people said , ' What about the U.S. Postal Service ? ' Well , the Postal Service was not exactly a paradigm of efficiency and neither is the grocery store . The time is ripe for change . " <p> But so far , Mr. Crowell 's dream outruns reality . <p> While Shoplink finishes testing its concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly manual , as Shoplink 's delivery people pick Ms. Orsatti 's items from the shelves of a local retail supermarket  --  a la Peapod . Later this year , however , Shoplink plans to unveil a highly automated system and its own product warehouse in Westwood , hoping to sever all ties with supermarkets . <p> When that system is operating , an order like Ms. Orsatti 's would be transmitted directly to a powerful work station called a transaction server , which would use warehouse management software to generate an electronic packing order . <p> That order would then be sent automatically to a human packer , equipped with a wireless hand-held device directing him to specific items on designated shelves and enabling him to scan each product 's bar code so a replacement could be ordered automatically . Eventually , Shoplink might use robotic devices to pack these orders , but in the early going , human hands will do the job . <p> Significantly , though , no stock clerk will be stacking items on a supermarket shelf , only to have a consumer come by to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel them to the checkout line , where the clerk can scan each item , and the bag boy can pack them  --  and so on and so forth , in the bucket-brigade manner of the conventional supermarket . <p> This hand-to-hand process adds nearly 20 percent to the price of the average grocery bill , according to Mr. Schneider of Andersen Consulting , but it nets the grocer a gross profit margin of less than 2 percent . <p> One of Shoplink 's fiercest rivals is Tim DeMello , a 38-year-old former stockbroker who has spent the last four years studying the consumer-direct distribution model  --  particularly the Peapod approach . <p> Although Peapod takes orders via phone , fax or the Peapod World Wide Web site , the automation basically stops there . So while the service saves time for consumers , who pay a monthly fee of $4.95 , plus a 5 percent markup on the retail price of each order filled , the process does little to reduce the cost of getting goods from the manufacturer to the home . <p> Mr. DeMello , who has started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be based near Shoplink in Westwood , Mass. , concluded that the Peapod model had severe limitations . <p> Like Mr. Crowell of Shoplink , he is basing his service on a centralized distribution center . And like Shop link , Streamline will arrange to leave the groceries in a secured refrigerator for an additional monthly fee , so the customer need not be home at delivery time  --  or even for several days after . More than a convenience for consumers , the approach makes delivery routing and scheduling much more efficient for the company . <p> Mr. DeMello took part in last year 's Andersen Consulting study , which gave him some useful cost comparisons with the supermarket business . And real estate turns out to be key . <p> Streamline 's leased 56,000-square-foot Westwood warehouse costs $6.50 a square foot a month , compared with an average $18.50 a square foot for a Boston-area supermarket . This savings alone could go a long way toward helping Mr. DeMello realize the profit of 6 cents on the dollar he is forecasting for Streamline , compared with less than 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shoplink , Mr. Demello is given to ambitious extrapolations and national aspirations . <p> Right now , Streamline has 250 customers , each generating an average of $450 a month in revenue . Based on his back-of-the-grocery-list calculations , he estimates that the typical customer will spend an average of $5,600 a year with Streamline , yielding $1,800 in gross profit . <p> " Our objective is to have a million households in the U.S. installed in seven to 10 years , " said Mr. DeMello , who so far is backed with some $5 million in venture capital  --  about the same amount that Mr. Crowell has raised for Shoplink . <p> Andrew Parkinson , the 39-year-old founder and president of Peapod , said that the key to a successful home delivery business was volume , and that start-ups like Shoplink and Streamline were underestimating the complexity of the home delivery of groceries . <p> As customer volume warrants , Mr. Parkinson said , Peapod will almost certainly move toward a warehouse-distribution system in tandem with its retailers . " But you need volume in order to justify warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-line shopping wins , many analysts say that the ultimate losers could be supermarket companies , unless they , too , adapt to the electronic future . For grocers , it is a question of timing  --  when to begin turning checkout line customers into on-line subscribers . <p> " At some point , we 'll have to get into it , " said Robert S. Annand Sr. , the 56-year-old chief executive of Roche Brothers , a $355 million grocery chain based in Wellesley , Mass. , a 20-minute station-wagon drive from Shoplink and Streamline headquarters . <p> " But so far , nobody has impacted my business , so I 'm not about to invest millions of dollars on something that is n't affecting me . My customers will tell me when to get into it . " <p> Chart : " From Warehouse to Your House " Criticizing supermarket inefficiences , several start-ups hope to streamline the distribution and sale of groceries to Americans.Cost savings are to come from reducing the times an item changes hands between the manufacturer and the consumer 's kitchen cabinet .
