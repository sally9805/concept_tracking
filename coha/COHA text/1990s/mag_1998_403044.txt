/Jan 1999 It 's a nut . It 's a bean . It 's both . The soybean is the most versatile protein on this planet . Ask anyone in America , but not on the street unless it has four legs . Animals have been eating the bean for years to get that extra smooth coat , better muscle and leaner bodies . In other Far Eastern countries , soy has been the major protein source since the Roman Empire . So , where has this magical " Jack and the Bean " been for us in America ? We too are part of the animal kingdom , just another link in the food chain . The Food and Drug Administration now considers soy a complete protein . Nutritionists once said legumes combined with rice were the only complete vegetable proteins because of a study done on rats . A few years ago a researcher discovered that we humans are not rats . Surprise . Our proteins needs are different . In fact it may be what is n't in soy that makes it beneficial . Compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the building blocks of protein ( amino acid ) . In the body methionine is converted into homocysteine , a substance that can increase the risk of atherosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) . Homocysteine is metabolized in the body by vitamin B-6 and folate . Deficiencies of these vitamins or congenital absence of certain enzymes can raise homocysteine levels and accelerate hardening of the arteries . Individuals with homocystinuria ( the enzyme deficiency ) rarely live beyond the age of 40 . Yes , your mother was right when she told you to " eat your veggies " because that 's where vitamin B-6 and folate are found . Fruits , vegetables and fiber are good for the body . Who would have ever thought that mom was right again although she never knew until now that this vegetable is meat ? Soy protein has another property that is beneficial . It is easily taken up in the body . The digestibility is as high as any protein . This fact should not be confused with the gaseous property of the bean , which comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raffinose . We lack the necessary enzymes to break down these substances . However , there is good news on the soy front . A new variety of soybeans is being harvested that has less of these carbohydrates . This improves digestibility with decreased abdominal discomfort and bloating . In addition soy proteins are kinder on the kidneys , especially important for diabetics with renal disease . When excess proteins occur in the body , the kidneys secrete the excess in the urine , spilling protein . With large amounts of animal protein calcium is also excreted . This fact may explain why people in this country still have a high risk of osteoporosis in spite of warnings to get our calcium . The soy protein appears to be beneficial in lessening these risks in addition to substances found in abundance in soy known as isoflavones . These substrates , called phytoestrogens , fool the body in duplicating as well as blocking estrogen effects . Soy research is ongoing at present , but is showing a risk reduction for osteoporosis , certain cancers of the breast , colon and prostate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Research is underway in California by Dr. Dean Ornish to determine if an ultra low-fat vegetarian diet with extra soy can slow down the progression of prostate cancer . These isoflavones also appear to help reduce cholesterol . Just two servings of soy a day can reduce elevated cholesterol values by as much as 10 to 15 percent . For my heart patients I usually recommend a soy smoothie every morning with an afternoon snack of roasted soy nuts . They 're as tasty as peanuts with double the amount of protein and half the amount of fat . In addition it is good fat , lower in saturation and richer in the omega-3 fatty acids ( the good guy fat ) found in fish such as tuna and salmon . In the last issue I printed a recipe for a smoothie that can help lower cholesterol one sip at a time . It has flaxseed powder in the shake to boost the good fat ratio . It helps to lower triglycerides and increase the good cholesterol ( HDL ) . The recipe is reprinted again for reference .

It seems as though soy may be the future zucchini ; everything is being made from it-soy diesel fuel , solvents , soy ink , soy non-toxic crayons and even soy wax for snow skis . I 'm waiting for better wallpaper paste and a soy tire that will go 100,000 miles . It truly is an energy plant for beasts , humans and machine . Soy now it 's time to put this bean into your diet . I remember reading about getting this bean into everyday cooking some years ago . My first attempt was n't good . The beans kept falling between the grates on my grill . Then I tried tofu-the mysterious other other white meat . Forget tofu stir-fry unless you like stand alone tofu . This substance is not ready for American prime-time dinner , but I believe it may be the yogurt for the next century . It is an ideal protein when used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check out the recipe for the salmon patties-the healthiest burger in America . The tofu boosts up the protein , expands the salmon to reduce costs , adds a smoother texture and beefs up the good fat ratio . Plus it 's tasty , especially with the licorice sauce . Yes , that 's right , hints of licorice with dill-move over tartar sauce , here 's the doc 's sauce , fat-free and fast to make . There are a variety of soy meat alternatives . Some are made from soy protein concentrates or isolated soy protein . Depending upon the protein extraction process , the end food product may lack beneficial effects-absent isoflavones if it is soy protein concentrate . If you are well informed , probably you have been reading a lot about soy . Remember , not all soy foods have the same ratio of fat , protein , isoflavones and carbohydrates . In general , the more processed the less beneficial . The soy burger still carries some bad baggage , left over from the ' ' 70s when these burgers were forced on the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these little beanie burgers were dried out , over cooked , tough and lacked eye appeal , not to say anything about taste . Soy food technology has really helped put the soy burger back on the shelf . The texture is good and taste has really improved with touches of garlic and smoked flavors . A real surprise is the recipe for tailgate BBQ . It 's made from textured soy protein ( TSP ) . This dehydrated soy protein can be found in whole food stores , nutrition shops and specialty grocery stores . It is the most inexpensive protein on earth . It 's a quick recipe ; easy to fix with the ingredients stored dry on the shelf . The last recipe , which should be the first , is chocolate cake . It 's a woman 's dream come true-chocolate that has protein , reduced fat with less calories . It reminds me of what zucchini did for cake years ago . The tofu replaces the eggs and the applesauce replaces the oil . It is very rich and dense . You can have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you waiting for ? This soybean can be easily added to your diet . And do n't worry , you wo n't be walking on all fours . Try just one or two servings a week , increasing the number of recipes as you acquire new tastes and textures . Go ahead , pass the bean , or is it vegetameat ? Cook well .. live long . THE TOP TEN SOY FACTS Soy is a complete protein . Substances in soy can reduce risks of osteoporosis , cancer and heart disease . Soy sauce , soybean oils and soy protein concentrate lack the full benefit of soy . The fat in soy is good fat and low in saturation . Soymilk is lactose-and cholesterol-free . A variety of soy products can be used in many recipes . Most national grocers carry full lines of soy products . Soy cooking can be fun . Use soy as a protein booster in recipes . Go for the bean directly-roasted soynuts and green picked sweet beans are high on flavor and are all natural . ROASTED SOY NUTS Soy nuts are a delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into salads . Salt the bean lightly before roasting if desired . Numerous flavors can be sprinkled on to the soy nuts a few minutes before they are done roasting , such as dry barbecue , Cajun , Italian or dry fat-free ranch dressing mix . The following recipes are for using soybeans that have been soaked eight hours or more . Microwave method : Use 1 cup beans . Drain them well . Spread the beans into a single layer in a 9-inch or 10-inch glass pie plate . Microwave on high for three minutes . Stir , then cook three minutes more . After that cook for one minute at a time , stirring after each minute to ensure even browning . The total time will vary depending on the moisture of the beans and the wattage of the oven , but will probably take about nine to 12 minutes . When the beans are beginning to get hard and golden , you may want to cook for 30-second intervals to avoid burning them . They are done when they are golden brown and crunchy . Oven method : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drain the beans , then spread into a single layer .
