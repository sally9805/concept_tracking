In a spacious and sunny Washington office , an anonymous senior Administration official sits and discusses U.S. options in Indochina . " The simplest approach in Cambodia , " he theorizes , " is to let the military situation play itself out . " <P> On the other side of the globe , in a military ward of a hospital in the Cambodian town of Kampong Spoe , 25 miles southwest of Phnom Penh , a soldier named Neh Kon , 30 , lies on a wooden pallet . He has lost both legs  --  one just above the knee , the other just below . The stumps are wrapped in flyspecked , blood-soaked bandages . Neh Kon 's wife sits beside him , holding their young child . Two weeks earlier , on patrol in Khmer Rouge territory , Neh Kon stepped on a mine . " By the time we get peace , " he says , " a lot of people wo n't have legs . " <P> In another ward of the same hospital lies a civilian woodcutter named Top Sakhan , 44 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a girl , 7 . A week before , Khmer Rouge guerrillas jumped him in a nearby forest . For no particular reason , they shot him in both legs with an AK-47 and left him lying there . " I called after them , ' Why do n't you just kill me ? ' " Top Sakhan says . " But they did n't answer . " Doctors saved his right leg and amputated the left . " His life is finished , " whispers the hospital administrator . <P> This is what is meant by letting the military situation " play itself out . " Such cool foreign-policy analysis rarely takes into account the suffering of people like Neh Kon and Top Sakhan . Nowhere is this truer than in Cambodia , whose modern misfortune has been to act as buffer and bargaining chip to nations more powerful than itself . Like Blanche DuBois , modern Cambodia has always depended for its survival on the kindness of strangers  --  and the strangers have not always been kind . While diplomats negotiated their shameful and shameless deals , Cambodians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1970 and 1975 , when Cambodia became a theater of the Vietnam War , a million or more ( out of a population of 7 million ) in the Khmer Rouge 's ensuing four-year reign of terror . <P> The Vietnamese occupation of Phnom Penh in 1979 forced the Khmer Rouge from power and replaced them with a pro-Hanoi and pro-Soviet government currently headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen , 39 , a poorly educated but extraordinarily bright former Khmer Rouge officer who lost an eye during the 1970-75 Cambodian war . Since that government took office , the toll in the country has been markedly lower : a few dozen or so limbs and lives lost each week as the deposed Khmer Rouge and other Cambodian factions  --  each representing combinations of outside support  --  fight to regain power . Vietnam ostensibly withdrew the last of its 150,000 troops in September , but attempts to negotiate an end to this new war are stymied , and the violence has escalated . <P> Moreover , it is not true that Vietnam has completely left Cambodia . A well- informed intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still attached to Hun Sen 's army , as are two understrength Vietnamese regiments of about 1,000 troops each . Two Vietnamese- speaking soldiers in Cambodian uniforms were aboard a recent flight from Phnom Penh to the provincial capital of Siem Reap , and interviews with residents there confirmed that many Vietnamese-speaking troops are assigned to government units in the area .
