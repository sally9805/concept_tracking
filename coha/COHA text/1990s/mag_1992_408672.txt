For the first time since Japan devastated the U.S. consumer electronics industry in the 1970s , American companies have a chance to stage a comeback in a mighty market that has annual sales of $32 billion in the U.S. and $100 billion worldwide . In fact the resurgence in U.S.-designed and U.S.-made consumer electronics products is already under way . Consider these harbingers : * AT &T'S; 1337 TELEPHONE-ANSWERING DEVICE . It 's no longer called a machine , because it has no moving parts ; instead of a tape , the $99 gadget records messages on a memory chip . The hugely successful , attractively designed 1337 has captured well over half the market in the small but growing tapeless product segment , beating out Sony and other Japanese stalwarts . * AT &T'S; NEW VIDEOPHONE . The $1,500 device , available in May , allows transmission of color video images  --  albeit somewhat jerky ones  --  over regular telephone wires . AT &T; has jumped in ahead of foreign manufacturers with this product , too , and is finally delivering on the promises it made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICROTAC LITE DIGITAL PERSONAL COMMUNICATOR . It 's the company 's latest cellular phone , the lightest and smallest commercially available anywhere . Motorola makes these dandy little phones in Arlington Heights , Illinois , and ships them to Japan and 50 other countries . * THE FIRST MASS-MARKET MULTIMEDIA HOME COMPUTER PRICED UNDER $1,000 . A major PC and workstation maker will announce it shortly for introduction within the next few months . A number of companies including IBM , Next Computer , Silicon Graphics , and CompuAdd already offer multimedia versions of their PCs or workstations  --  but at $5,000 and up . The new , more affordable multimedia PCs will speak , play music and video , send faxes , receive E-mail , and generally behave in a much more versatile and user-friendly fashion than their present-day PC forebears . The Japanese lag even further behind in multimedia than in cellular phones . * HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION . Three or four years from now , U.S. companies will have an opportunity to reenter in force the biggest segment of the consumer electronics market  --  TV . American companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to do just that with HDTV . The Federal Communications Commission is expected to set operating standards for U.S. HDTV receivers next year . Because the Japanese use older technology in their HDTV system , the U.S. could leapfrog right past them . All these wonders are just the beginning of a plethora of electronic marvels to come from U.S. companies . What 's making those products  --  and the American comeback  --  possible is an exciting U.S.-created and U.S.-dominated technology : digital signal processing , DSP for short . To many experts , DSP represents a turning point in electronics as dramatic and as wide-ranging in importance as the invention of the memory chip and the microprocessor  --  the computer on a chip  --  two decades ago . Those advances set off the electronics avalanche in the office and on the factory floor . DSP will now extend the penetration of electronics into almost every imaginable consumer niche in the home , in automobiles , in airplanes  --  just about anywhere . What 's the magic of DSP ? It enables software engineers to translate familiar continuously varying analog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the discrete digital language of computing by using DSP chips . Once transformed into the 1 's and 0 's of computer code , the signals can be manipulated in a variety of ways impossible when they are in analog form . Example : Digitized audio signals can be greatly compressed so they take less space in the airwaves , opening up new channels for cellular telephones in big cities where capacity is already strained . With analog technology , only a single phone conversation can be transmitted over a radio bandwidth ; digital systems can squeeze three or more conversations into the same space . Similar compression of video signals will bring hundreds of cable TV channels into the home . In one experiment in the New York City borough of Queens , American Television &; Communications , a subsidiary of Time Warner ( which owns FORTUNE 'S parent ) , already offers 150 cable channels through video compression . DSP can also eliminate ghost images from TV screens and banish those irritating Donald Duck squeaks and quacks from speeded-up playback of tape-recorded voice messages . A traveling executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twice their recorded speed without losing sound quality . In answering machines , DSP allows manufacturers to offer features that rival high-end voice mail systems , including individualized mailboxes for different members of the family . Since there 's no tape to rewind , the digital answering devices offer immediate playback of messages . The absence of moving parts makes these new products easier to manufacture and more reliable . AT &T; offers a two-year warranty on its 1337 , twice that on its tape machines . The 1337 provides seven minutes of recording time . Although AT &T's; tape-equipped machines are good for at least half an hour 's worth of messages , the company found that more than 90% of people who use recording machines at home think seven minutes is adequate . For business customers , AT &T; is planning to build a 30-minute version of the 1337 that may sell for $150 to $200 . Inexpensive DSP-powered telephones that recognize phone numbers spoken aloud and then dial them are entering the market . Automobile travelers are in for some pleasant surprises thanks to DSP . Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn mowers  --  will operate almost silently , thanks to a DSP trick that creates a stream of antinoise signals canceling out the racket . More cars will soon ride on DSP-controlled adaptive suspensions that instantaneously tailor the motion of each wheel to every pothole or highway expansion joint , as Britain 's Lotus already does . Inside , extraneous engine and outside noise will be eliminated , making every Chevrolet potentially as majestically silent as a Rolls-Royce . And anticollision automobile radar systems are finally in sight , thanks to DSP . " Hardly a month goes by without a new DSP application making headlines , " says Will Strauss , president of Forward Concepts , a DSP market research company in Tempe , Arizona . At the heart of DSP is the most complex computer software yet devised , consisting of complicated mathematical formulas known as algorithms . In essence , an algorithm is a set of instructions to execute a specific function  --  to generate a tone in telephone , for example . A recipe for baking a cake is a kind of algorithm . Everyone agrees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including some ex-Soviet scientists  --  holds a significant advantage in DSP , particularly over Japanese and other Far Eastern competitors . So adept are the Israelis in algorithm creation that a whole " DSP Valley " has arisen in Israel . U.S. semiconductor companies tap into the talent pool there via subsidiaries set up for that purpose . In Silicon Valley a number of companies started by Israelis or ex-Israelis , such as DSP Group Inc. and Zoran Corp. , specialrze in creating algorithms . It 's a happy break for the U.S. that DSP is n't a fairly simple technology like the one that underlies DRAMs ( dynamic random access memories ) , which the Japanese picked up , copied , and ran away with . DSP technology is considerably more complex and fast-moving , which makes it far tougher for the Japanese to appropriate . " The DSP business is dramatically different from what the Japanese are used to , " says Prabhat K. Dubey , director of processors at AT &T's; microelectronics division . " They are used to a stable , predictable environment with a step-by-step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intellectual content and finesse are required rather than a brute force approach . " Writing algorithms demands intuition and lots of creativity , which have not been the forte of the Japanese . Authors of complex algorithms are software 's counterparts of composers . " All algorithm developers are artists , " says Levy Gerzberg , an ex-Israeli mathematician and former Stanford professor who is now CEO of Zoran Corp . DSP chips are the most complex mathematical processing engines yet created in silicon : They can perform ten times as many numerical operations  --  up to 270 million a second  --  as the advanced Intel or Motorola microprocessors that power late-model PCs . The chips can also be programmed to run up to six different functions at the same time  --  say , playing classical music , sending a fax , and receiving voice mail all at once . The Japanese have not yet learned how to sing this kind of high-tech tune well . Not that they have n't tried . In the early 1980s NEC , Ricoh , Fuji , Oki , and other Japanese companies attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as the chips and the algorithms they contained increased in complexity , the Japanese could n't hack it . " Their chips did n't fly , " says one DSP specialist . NEC is the only Japanese company still active in the U.S. DSP market  --  and it 's a special case : 90% of its American volume goes to a Motorola subsidiary as modem chips . The Japanese retreat from an initial 93% of the market to a mere 6.5% today may be their first major defeat in any segment of the semiconductor business . The worldwide DSP chip market is galloping ahead by nearly 30% a year , three times as fast as semiconductors as a whole , according to Will Strauss of Forward Concepts . He sees this year 's $1.1 billion in DSP chip sales growing to $4 billion in 1996 . Some semiconductor company executives think Strauss is too conservative ; in the past few years sales of the chips by major suppliers  --  Texas Instruments , AT &T,; and Motorola have been doubling and even tripling annually . When the chips were first developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weapons applications , they were too expensive for most commercial uses . But now prices for the simplest chip have fallen from $50 as recently as 1985 to less than $5 . Ready availability and low price are what 's putting DSP chips into consumer products on a massive scale . The fact that the U.S. looms so large in DSP does not automatically guarantee a big U.S. comeback in consumer electronics , of course . It offers the opportunity , but ultimately success depends on whether U.S. companies grasp their advantage in algorithms and translate it into new products faster than overseas competitors . Right now the Japanese are smarting from an unaccustomed delay in time to market . Their huge consumer electronics combines such as Sony , Sanyo , and Matsushita ( maker of Panasonic products ) manufacture their own memory chips and other semiconductors . But lack of in-house DSP capability has put a hurdle in their path . " Japanese consumer electronics companies in the past synchronized their semiconductor production with end-product design , " says Bulent Celebi , a group director at National Semiconductor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do that . " Unable to create everything they need internally , the Japanese have to rely on outsiders  --  including small Silicon Valley DSP chip design firms . That has helped American companies bring DSP-powered products to market ahead of the Japanese . AT &T; beat both Sony and Panasonic to market with its 1337 answering device , Sony by eight months and Panasonic by more than a year . " Four years ago we were an also-ran in telephone answering machines , " says John F. Hanley , AT &T; group vice president for consumer products . " Today we 're the clear market leader . The 1337 is enhancing our lead position . " Casey Dworkin , president of Personal Technology Research , a consumer electronics data company in Waltham , Massachusetts , puts AT &T's; share of the U.S. digital answering device market  --  which will total some $140 million this year  --  at a fat 70% . He expects the market to grow to around $430 million in five years . The digital units already account for 7% of new answering machines and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises that AT &T's; VideoPhone will be followed by " an array of products yet to come  --  more video , speech , computing products " for the consumer market . He adds : " DSP offers a tremendous opportunity for the future . It allows much more flexibility in designing more compact products . And it allows us to mass-customize products as well . " For example , this summer AT &T; will put a DSP chip inside a $200 voice-activated cellular phone dialer that will respond to commands in either English or Spanish . Hanley says sales at AT &T's; eight-year-old consumer electronics division are growing 20% a year . American DSP successes are creating new manufacturing jobs . Motorola is expanding its facilities in suburban Chicago to meet a growing demand for cellular phones . Companies that supply DSP know-how and hardware are booming . Michael Lubin is executive vice president of Pacific Communication Sciences Inc. , of San Diego , a leader in applying DSP technology to telephones . He says his company " ca n't hire fast enough to keep up with all our opportunities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new air-to-ground service just inaugurated on USAir by In-Flight Phone Corp . of Oak Brook , Illinois . A terminal and telephone at a passenger 's seat make available phone calls , stock quotes , PC data links , E-mail messages , and fax transmissions . All this growth in the uses of DSP is expected to create whole new subsets of industries . The silent-muffler business alone could amount to several hundred million dollars a year , according to some estimates . So could DSP systems designed to silence vacuum cleaners , air conditioners , and refrigerators , an application Electrolux and other manufacturers are looking into . Of the few American consumer electronics companies that survived the Japanese blitz of the 1970s , Zenith is still U.S.-owned , but it assembles its TV sets in Mexico from U.S.-made components . France 's Thomson and Holland 's Philips , the new owners of the old GE and RCA factories and research facilities , produce  --  in the U.S.  --  more than one-third of all TV sets Americans buy . All three are working on HDTV with such high-tech powerhouses as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Center , and Compression Labs Inc. of San Jose , California . A pioneer in video signal processing , Compression Labs helped create AT &T's; VideoPhone . The company is now a member of the Thomson-Philips-NBC HDTV consortium , one of three competing groupings . The others are Zenith AT &T; and General Instrument-MIT . The FCC may choose a hybrid prototype of an HDTV receiver , using pieces of designs from different groups . In any case , the participants will be required to license the technology to other manufacturers . Their presence in the U.S. , where the most advanced digital HDTV technology is being developed , will give Zenith , Thomson , and Philips a leg up on the Japanese in manufacturing HDTV sets for the U.S. and possibly the European market too . Japanese companies will eventually make HDTV sets for American consumers as well , but at least in the beginning they will be at a disadvantage because Japanese authorities chose the older analog route to HDTV . The coming of DSP means that the ranks of U.S. consumer electronics companies could be bolstered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out a niche for its DSP chips in educational products such as Speak " n ' Spell and computers for children . Now TI is looking for new opportunities in consumer electronics , including ways to sell its educational products in Japan . Northwestern Bell and Bell South already offer digital answering devices built for them by outside manufacturers . Eastman Kodak has gone into consumer electronics too . In photo-processing shops , the company will soon install Sun Microsystems workstations that scan negatives and transfer pictures onto a CD-ROM disk so photographs can be preserved in digital form . The company plans a similar product for the home . Yet another sign that American companies are awakening to the new possibilities in consumer electronics : Hewlett-Packard just announced a device that allows interactive use of home TV sets for shopping and banking , as well as exchanging data with pocket computers . " We believe in a coming convergence of consumer and professional markets , " says vice president Roy E. Verley . " There probably will be other opportunities for us to cross the line into the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers of multimedia PCs . As a step in that direction , IBM recently joined forces with Apple Computer to develop multimedia software . Already available from semiconductor companies are add-on boards that can upgrade existing PCs to multimedia machines . Today those boards start at about $2,000 , but by summer the price should drop to $500 . Rana Mainee , an analyst with Inteco Corp. , a Norwalk , Connecticut , PC market research company , estimates that three years from now about 1.5 million multimedia PCs will be sold in the U.S. annually , and another 750,000 PCs will be upgraded to multimedia machines with enhancement boards . At least 85% of multimedia PCs will be either American-made or American-designed , Mainee adds . " The Japanese do n't have much of a chance in multimedia PCs , " says Tom Lookabaugh , director of research and new business technology at Compression Labs . " I really do n't see them playing a role for some time . " Now there 's a switch . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
