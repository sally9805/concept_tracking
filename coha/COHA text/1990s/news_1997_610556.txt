<p> In this high-tech world , some of us have never mastered the simple things . Like how to hard-cook an egg . <p> " No , you did not pick a useless subject , " says Linda Braun , consumer services manager for the American Egg Board . She obviously has an interest in the topic , but she also knows what Americans do n't know when it comes to eggs . And " by and large , " she says , when it comes to hard-cooking them , " a lot of people have no clue . " <p> Braun is not suggesting that vast numbers of the population are panic-stricken before Easter , fumbling hopelessly for some connection between water and a pan . <p> What she is saying is that when it comes to hard-cooking eggs ( and that 's hard-cooking , not hard-boiling , but more about that later ) , there is a definite technique . Something so seemingly easy to do is also incredibly easy to mess up . How many times have your eggs cracked , the shells clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringed in extraterrestrial-colored green ? <p> Some people have spent large chunks of their careers studying these problems . " We 've cooked thousands of eggs , " says Daniel Fletcher , a professor of poultry science at the University of Georgia , the site of numerous studies for the egg industry . " We 've had hens working overtime for us . We 've gotten so sick of egg salad . . . " <p> After Easter , many eggs meet their destinies as egg salad , too  --  if they 're not peeled and gobbled up whole . Others go the way of the trash can , after being dyed , hidden , rolled , smashed and then licked by the family cat . There are 300 million more eggs sold during the month Easter falls in , and , however they end up , they have to get hard-cooked first . Somehow . <p> So here 's what Braun and other egg experts told us to do , and what happened when we listened . <p> DO N'T USE REALLY FRESH EGGS <p> Ironically , the innovations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect hard-cooked egg . " That 's the crazy thing about this , " says Fletcher . <p> With improvements in automation and refrigeration , eggs are relatively fresher than they were 10 or 15 years ago . And the fresher the egg , the harder it will be to peel . <p> The reason is this : In a very fresh egg , the proteins in the egg white and the shell membrane have not yet separated , explains William Stadelman , professor emeritus at Purdue University and senior editor of " Egg Science and Technology " ( Food Products Press , 1995 , fourth edition ) . As the egg ages , its pH increases , it loses carbon dioxide and water and takes in air . As air is pulled in , it separates the membrane from the white , making the egg easier to peel , adds Braun of the Egg Board . <p> Unfortunately , this interaction can be delayed by another innovation , Fletcher explains . Many commercial eggs ( including Safeway 's , but not Giant 's ) are lightly coated with mineral oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them fresh . But this seals the pores , which retards the gas exchange , " which kind of works against you if you want to hard-cook them , " he says . <p> All is not completely lost  --  and thank goodness , since otherwise every attempt to peel a hard-cooked egg would result in a portable meteor . That 's because despite the oiling , some air exchange continues , says Paul Ruszler , a commercial egg specialist and associate professor of poultry science at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg . Plus , when you cook the egg , the heat breaks the protein bonds , he adds . <p> So what is the appropriate age for an egg headed for hot water , and how in the world do you tell how old ( or young ) it is ? <p> Ideally , you want to hard-cook eggs at least a week after they were packed , according to Braun . To figure that out , look on the side of the carton for a three-digit number ( this should be close to the " sell by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , corresponds to the Julian calendar . In other words , the number on the side of a carton of eggs packed on March 26 would be " 085 , " since March 26 is the 85th day of the year . <p> The " sell-by " date is also related to the pack date , but stores use different criteria for this . At Safeway , for example , the sell-by date is 24 to 25 days after the eggs are packed ; at Giant , the sell-by date is 30 days after packing . So if you buy eggs at Giant today with a sell-by date of April 18 , they were probably packed on March 18 , a week ago . <p> If this esoterica is strictly for eggheads , the easy answer is to buy eggs at least a week to 10 days before you want to hard-cook them , recommends Braun . <p> Stadelman of Purdue uses another trick : He cracks one of the raw eggs from a carton , and if the white clings to the membrane , he knows he 's dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be hard to peel . We tried Stadelman 's trick , with a fresh egg and an older one ( we did the pack-date calculations ) . The younger egg 's white did want to hang on longer to the shell , while the older egg 's white seemed more watery . But whether the latter would have been easier to peel . . . well , we 'll never know . <p> A final word about eggs that are too old : As eggs age and their whites thin , the yolk migrates from the middle to the top . " The gravity of the yolk is less than that of the white , " explains Stadelman . " It 's like cream rising to the top of milk . " And then when you try to peel it , there wo n't be a thick-enough layer of cooked white . Chances are you 'll rip off a chunk of the yolk . <p> THE GREEN-RING SYNDROME <p> " I 've seen more hard-cooked eggs with green rings in my life , " laments Braun , who believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they are is a result of overcooking . Too much heat causes the iron in the egg yolk and the sulfur in the albumen to form ferrous sulfide , a harmless greenish compound that gives eggs that Saturn look . <p> That 's why you should never boil eggs , says Braun . Read on . <p> THE METHODS TO THIS MADNESS <p> There 's more than one way to hard-cook an egg , but after careful study and experimentation , here 's what the Egg Board recommends : Put the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and add enough water to come at least 1 inch above the eggs . Cover the pan and bring the water just to a boil . Then turn off the heat ( remove it from the burner if you have an electric range ) . Leave the cover on the pan and let the eggs sit in the hot water . It takes about 15 minutes to hard-cook large eggs by this method , three minutes less for medium eggs and three minutes more for extra-large eggs , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually possible to screw this up . The eggs were only soft-boiled ( or soft-cooked , as the Egg Board might say ) . A second try , letting the egg sit for 18 minutes , worked . A call to Braun determined the error . " It definitely needs to be a rolling boil " before you shut off the heat , she said . It was that " just to a boil " that threw us . <p> But what about other methods that the Egg Board does n't recommend ? One of the most popular is to lower eggs into already boiling water and then simmer for 12 minutes or so . We tried it with one cold egg , and not surprisingly , it cracked immediately when placed in boiling water , then rocked and tottered like a baby chick . The reason : thermal shock . <p> Some cookbooks suggest piercing the large end of the egg shell with an egg piercer , needle or straight pin , and then placing it in boiling water . This presumably releases the pressure that can lead to cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience for this " acupuncture , " especially when it comes to cooking massive quantities of Easter eggs ? <p> Braun is uncomfortable with this method for another reason . By piercing the egg , you 've literally " opened " the shell , she says . " Yes , it 's a small hole , but bacteria are much smaller than the hole you 've created . " If you 're going to eat the egg right away , not to worry ; the hot water sterilizes it . But cooked eggs can become cross-contaminated , particularly at Easter , when they are dyed and handled , Braun says . <p> Yet another method is to place the eggs in cold water , bring to a boil , then lower the heat to a simmer for 12 to 15 minutes . This pretty much guarantees against a soft-boiled result , and Braun endorses it . But the Egg Board does n't recommend it for the masses for this reason : " A lot of people have a different idea of what a ' simmer ' is , " says Braun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil ; to others , the water is barely moving . " And it 's an especially difficult recommendation for today 's consumers , she adds , " who tend not to have a good idea of cooking terms . " <p> DEALING WITH THE PEELING <p> Ever wonder why some eggs from the same carton are a cinch to peel while the shells on others cling like Cling Wrap ? <p> There are at least two reasons for this . For one , as Virginia Tech 's Ruszler explains , just because they came from the same carton does n't mean they were laid the same day , nor by the same hen . Secondly , some hens lay more porous eggs than others . A porous egg will release carbon dioxide more quickly and should be easier to peel . <p> Obviously , you have no knowledge of or control over either of these factors . So even though there are recommended methods for peeling , do n't expect them to always work perfectly . <p> The Egg Board , however , recommends the following procedure : First cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer the cooked eggs to a pan or bowl of ice or cold water . Or carefully pour off the hot water in the pan and run cold water over the eggs until they 're cool to the touch . The cooling process stops the cooking process and also causes the eggs to contract within their shells , making them easier to peel . <p> Now , for the board 's cracking and peeling drill : Crackle the shell all over by tapping it gently on a table or counter top . To loosen the crackled shell , roll the egg back and forth between your hands . Since the egg 's air cell is usually in the large end of the egg , start to peel there . It may also help to hold the egg under running cold water or dip it in a bowl of water . Remember this last tip if your shells are adhering like rubber cement . In fact , running water over hard-to-peel cooked eggs worked great for us . <p> To make a long story longer , the Egg Board also mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dipping them in warm water before peeling . This method gets the booby prize , at least when we tried it . <p> Researchers are divided on the issue of whether salting the water makes hard-cooked eggs easier to peel , the board says . Some research has shown that adding 1 1/2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon of salt per quart of water makes unoiled eggs easier to peel but makes no difference with the oiled kind . We tried it with unoiled eggs from Giant , and we can say with certainty that it made no difference . In other words , they were still no breeze to peel . <p> Wild and crazy professors at the University of Georgia have also discovered that blowing a fan on eggs all night speeds up the release of carbon dioxide , making them easier to peel . ( Adults , do n't try this at home . ) <p> A more realistic albeit cumbersome method tested by the professors involves plunging the eggs in ice water for 60 seconds immediately after cooking , then plunging them in boiling water for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat causes the shell and membranes to expand without the heat reaching the egg itself . In our uncontrolled test , this method did n't work wonders . <p> But Ruszler from Virginia Tech recommends a variation on this theme , keeping the eggs in the ice bath longer  --  for two minutes  --  then plunging them into boiling water for 25 seconds . Now this has possibilities ; out of four eggs , three peeled with ease . ( To make it somewhat less involved , remove the cooked eggs with a slotted spoon , then reheat the cooking water to boiling . ) <p> Of course , when it comes to Easter eggs , none of these cook-and-peel methods apply . Ruszler says to keep your dyed cooked eggs no longer than a week in the refrigerator . And of course , the longer they hang around , the easier they 'll peel  --  and the sicker of egg salad you 'll become .
