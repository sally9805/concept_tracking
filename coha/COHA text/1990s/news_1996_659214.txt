<p> The six unions on strike against Detroit 's daily newspapers broke an agreement not to engage in violence or other illegal activity on the picket lines and have been interfering with people reporting to work , the National Labor Relations Board said . <p> William C. Schaub Jr. , NLRB regional director , said Feb. 8 that he was setting aside last month 's agreement and planned to issue an unfair labor practice complaint against the unions . <p> He said he would schedule a trial on the complaint . <p> Schaub said Detroit Newspapers , the agency that runs business operations of the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News , complained that the six striking unions were ignoring the agreement announced Jan. 12 . <p> He said his subsequent investigation found " that the unions had engaged in blocking full ingress and egress , and ( used ) star nails and were intimidating people attempting to cross the picket line and attempting to go to work . " <p> Roger Kerson , spokesman for the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions , said Schaub 's finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look foward to our day in court , " he said . He declined other comment . <p> Tim Kelleher , Detroit Newspapers senior vice president for labor relations , said the company would seek an injunction from the full NLRB . He said the problems with the unions have been sporadic , but he believed they " wantonly and willfully " ignored the agreement . <p> Free Press publisher Heath Meriwether said he hoped the finding would pressure the unions to change some tactics . <p> " I think it 's deplorable that the unions , only days after they said they would stop , have been found to be doing the very thing that they said they would n't , " he said . <p> Robert Giles , editor and publisher of the News , said problems have been scattered , " but there certainly is a sense of intimidation that is there whenever the pickets are around the building . " <p> " Things are said that , from our point of view , are designed to frighten or intimidate people who work here , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrain , threaten or coerce replacement workers or any employees of the employers because they choose to cross the unions ' picket lines , " an NLRB statement said . <p> The informal agreement negotiated by the newspapers , the NLRB and the unions included provisions saying the unions also would not block entries and exits to Detroit Newspapers property . <p> Since the strike began July 13 , there have been instances of rocks and other items being thrown , windows broken and shoving and threats on picket lines . Tire-piercing star nails also have been thrown around newspaper printing plants and distribution centers . <p> Union officials have insisted they oppose any violence and have said some problems were caused by people other than strikers . <p> Schaub has scheduled a Feb. 26 trial on an earlier unfair labor practice finding against Detroit Newspapers . That finding said the newspapers had not bargained in good faith . <p> OnLine Newspapers Tripled to 175 Last Year <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - The number of North American newspapers available through online computer services nearly tripled last year to about 175 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry group said . <p> The newspapers are available on the Internet , the global network that links millions of computers at universities , corporations , government agencies and homes . Readers can gain access on the network 's World Wide Web , through commercial online services such as America Online and CompuServe , or through computer bulletin board services . <p> The 175 North American newspapers , up from about 60 in 1994 , put such publications well ahead of other mass media online , the Newspaper Association of America said Feb. 5 . <p> About 600 newspapers published outside North America also are available online , the group said . <p> " Newspapers ' move into cyberspace ... is dramatic evidence that the industry recognizes the need to provide news , information and advertising to readers in a new form , " said John F. Sturm , president and chief executive officer of the association . <p> Many newspapers offer electronic help-wanted and other classified ads as well as access to more in-depth information on specific subjects . <p> ACLU , Others Challenge Cyber Anti-Porn Law <p> PHILADELPHIA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecent " and sexually explicit material to minors over computer networks was challenged in court the moment President Clinton signed it into law Feb. 8 . <p> The Justice Department pledged not to initiate prosecutions for a week , and a federal judge declined to temporarily block the Decency Act , giving prosecutors until Feb. 14 to submit written legal arguments . <p> The American Civil Liberties Union and 19 other groups said the law violates privacy rights and strangles free speech by authorizing the government to prosecute people even for the private messages they send about AIDS , abortion , politics and science - any subject involving sex . <p> " What Congress has done is to criminalize indecent speech sent by the Internet , " Stefan Presser , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania , said outside court . " Astonishingly they have n't bothered to define what indecent speech is . " <p> Actually , the law defines indecency as " any comment , request , suggestion , proposal , image or other communication that , in context , depicts or describes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual or excretory activities or organs . " <p> Thanks to a last-minute addition by Rep. Henry Hyde , R-Ill. , it also extends a rarely enforced , 123-year-old law into cyberspace , making it a violation of obscenity laws to use computers to provide information about how to obtain an abortion . <p> The Hyde amendment prompted a separate effort in New York to block the law by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League and other groups . They dropped their request for a restraining order after failing to prove anyone faced impending harm , but vowed to press on with their lawsuit . <p> Supporters say the law , which carries fines up to $ 250,000 and jail terms of up to five years , will protect children from pornography and , contrary to assertions made by the ACLU , will not ban general information about abortion and AIDS prevention . <p> U.S. Attorney Anthony J. Coppolino , who argued against the restraining order , said restrictions are necessary because computers have become increasingly pervasive and bring pornography right into people 's homes . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecent images are available on a computer by ... a click of a mouse , " Coppolino said . <p> Coppolino also told U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter that the Justice Department will stand by its longstanding policy " that abortion-related speech prohibitions are unconstitutional and will not be enforced . " <p> The Clinton administration has also repeatedly raised concerns about the constitutionality of the computer porn provisions ; it was n't immediately clear how vigorously it would fight to uphold them . <p> Vice President Al Gore dodged the question Feb. 8 when asked by The Associated Press in Washington which side the Justice Department would support . <p> " We 're obligated to administer the law , but we said from the start this particular provision will stand or fall in court , " Gore responded . <p> Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , said Feb. 9 he will seek to repeal that provision of the bill . He said it violates computer users ' free speech rights and would cripple the growth of online communications . <p> Coppolino said the contested provisions will not be enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people who use the Internet until then would not be prosecuted in the future for indecency . <p> That prompted a warning from the ACLU 's Presser : " The world of computer users needs to understand that the judge has not ruled , and for the next seven days you will use the Net at your own risk . " <p> The law prohibits all " socially useful , nonpornographic speech that happens to be about sex , " added Christopher Hansen , the national ACLU senior staff counsel . <p> He noted parents already can limit their children 's access to adult material by using safeguards on computer services or by buying inexpensive software that limits the Internet sites children may reach . <p> Sen. Jim Exon , D-Neb. , who sponsored the wide-ranging Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 , expressed confidence in the anti-porn provisions . <p> " The legislation will not ban works of art or medical warnings because they would not be ' in context , patently offensive ' under the Supreme Court 's indecency standard used in our legislation , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to print media and private communication , which enjoy broad protection under the First Amendment , rather than television and radio , which are governed by indecency provisions enforced by the Federal Communications Commission . <p> But Cathy Cleaver , a lawyer with the Family Research Council in Washington , compared the new act to the existing dial-a-porn law , which requires phone sex services to install safeguards - including use of credit cards - to help keep minors off the lines . Computer porn sites also could require users to provide credit card numbers or some other proof of legal age , she said .
