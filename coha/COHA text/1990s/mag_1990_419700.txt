Signs of prehistoric superquakes may portend a future shock <p> Like most parents , geologist Brian Atwater worries about his daughter 's safety But these days , he has an unusual concern : The public school she attends in Seattle has unreinforced masonry walls , a construction notorious for collapsing during earthquakes . The same type of walls crushed hundreds of thousands of people during the 1976 Tangshan quake in China . <p> A decade ago , Atwater would have paid little notice to schoolroom walls . But over the last several years , he and other scientists have found disturbing signs that the Pacific Northwest has experienced giant quakes in the distant past and that the area may be headed for a catastrophic shock in the near or distant future . <p> At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December , researchers discussed the recently uncovered evidence of quake potential in the Pacific Northwest . While some remain unconvinced that huge earthquakes  --  with magnitudes of 8 or higher  --  do indeed strike this region , a growing number consider such shocks a serious possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that northwestern cities such as Portland , Seattle and Vancouver have not prepared for earthquakes of this magnitude , which could rattle the region 's population centers with enough force to make the recent San Francisco-area damage seem mild in comparison . <p> " I think it 's quite true to say that nothing in these areas has really been designed with one of these earthquakes in mind , " says seismologist Paul Somerville of Woodward-Clyde Consultants in Pasadena , Calif . At the meeting , Somerville and his colleagues presented estimates of the degree of shaking Portland and Seattle would suffer during such a massive earthquake . <p> If a Big One does visit the Pacific Northwest , it will originate tens of kilometers below ground , from a tectonic structure called the Cascadia subduction zone that runs offshore from Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino , Calif . This zone marks the place where a piece of ocean floor , known as the Juan de Fuca plate , is slowly crashing into the edge of the North American plate . As they collide , the more buoyant North American plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the Earth 's interior . <p> Subduction zones have spawned many powerful earthquakes , including ones in Chile ( 1960 ) and Alaska ( 1964 ) . Such giant jolts occur when the subducting plate fails to slide smoothly beneath the overriding block . The two plates lock together , building up strain for hundreds of years until they suddenly slip past each other , generating a massive shudder . <p> But not all subduction zones shuffle along in this lock-slip fashion . At the Mariana trench north of New Guinea , for example , the Pacific plate appears to slide beneath the Philippine plate without causing large earthquakes . <p> Geologists do n't know which type of subduction goes on in the Cascadia region . Sensitive seismometers in the area have not detected any tremors originating from the interface between the Juan de Fuca plate and the North American plate . Researchers seeking to interpret this unusual seismic quiet are thus left with a dilemma : Either the plates have locked together and are preparing to unleash a potential killer quake , or they are safely gliding past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't solve that dilemma . They go back only as far as the early 1800s , covering a time span in which no great earthquake has struck the region . To look at earlier times , several scientists have turned to the geologic record . <p> Atwater , who works with the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) in Seattle , started his search by studying creek sediments near bays along the Washington coast , on the assumption that these areas would have preserved the calling cards of any large subduction earthquakes in the region . In other parts of the world , such quakes have caused land along coastal regions to abruptly rise or drop ( " subside " ) by several meters . <p> In 1987 , Atwater reported evidence that sections of the Washington coast had subsided perhaps as many as six times over the last several thousand years ( SN : 7/18/87 , p.42 ) . Since then , he and his colleagues have traced the quake evidence farther down the coast and have used carbon-14 dating to establish the timing of those events . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Seattle reported that signs of repeated subsidence extend several hundred kilometers southward through central Oregon . South of there , the record becomes more complex , but geologists have found indications of either subsidence or uplift as far down the coast as northern California . <p> Land can rise or subside slowly over hundreds or thousands of years for reasons other than earthquakes . But Atwater points to several factors that link the recently discovered evidence to seismic superjolts . In the sediments , he has found estuarine muds deposited directly on top of soil layers  --  a pattern suggesting that the lowland areas suddenly dropped below the high-tide level and were quickly covered by mud . If the area had subsided slowly , he says , he would have seen a gradual transition between the soil layer and the overlying mud . <p> In the same sediments , Atwater has also found signs of the huge waves , called tsunamis , that earthquakes can generate . Some of the subsided sediments show a thin sheet of sand packed between the soil and mud layers . To explain the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , quake-generated waves washed over a subsided section of coastline and deposited the sand , which quickly became submerged in mud . <p> Other researchers have wondered whether nonseismic processes such as storms could have created the sand deposits , but geologists Mary A. Reinhart and Joanne Bourgeois of the University of Washington in Seattle think not . After studying the buried sediments and then simulating tsunamis with a computer model , they conclude that gigantic waves appear the best explanation for the deposits they examined . <p> Atwater , Reinhart and Bourgeois traveled to Chile last year to test their theories . Along the coast where the aftermath of the 1960 quake remains visible , they found similar examples of subsided coastline and tsunami deposits , he says . <p> Some of the most dramatic evidence for prehistoric earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest comes from the ghostly red cedar trees , or " snags , " that remain standing in the region though they perished centuries ago . <p> Tidal mud has buried the lower trunks of the cedar snags , suggesting the trees died when the ground level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . Using tree rings to try to date the deaths of the cedars , David Yamaguchi of the University of Colorado in Boulder is attempting to determine when and how rapidly the subsidence occurred . So far , his work indicates that a section of the Washington coast , at least 90 km long , dropped suddenly about three centuries ago . <p> By comparing the growth rings in the snags with those in 500-year-old living cedars , Yamaguchi has assigned dates to the outer  --  and therefore oldest  --  rings remaining on the snags . At six sites along the coast , he has found drowned trees whose outer rings date to the years 1678 through 1687 . These rings can not reveal the exact year of tree death ; that evidence vanished as centuries of wind and rain stripped the snags of their bark and outermost rings . However , because the snags are clustered so closely together , Yamaguchi thinks all the drowned trees died during the same year , sometime between 1684 and 1687 . He hopes that future studies on growth rings in spruce roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their demise . <p> The tree-ring evidence for a quake three centuries ago dovetails with less precise carbon-14 dating of the subsided sediments . Most of the coastal areas along the subduction zone appear to have suddenly subsided or uplifted during the late 1600s . However , Atwater and his colleagues can not tell whether they are looking at the results of one huge , magnitude 9 quake or a series of jolts similar to the pair of magnitude 8 shocks that hit Japan in 1944 and 1946 . <p> More distressing to area residents , the carbon-14 work suggests the Cascadia quakes do not hit with a predictable frequency . On average , the subsidence events recurred about 600 years apart , but that figure is misleading , Atwater says . The shortest span between subsidence events lasted only a few centuries ; the longest lasted more than 1,000 years . " The only thing fairly certain is that they do n't recur like clockwork , " he says . <p> This makes it difficult to speculate on when a future superquake might hit . It may lurk several centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could happen in five minutes , " says geophysicist Paul Vincent of the University of Oregon in Eugene . " That 's the scary thing about this . We do n't know how much time we have to prepare . " <p> As Atwater and his co-workers collect signs of prehistoric quakes , Vincent and several other researchers are finding evidence that the Cascadia subduction zone is storing up energy for a future quake . By analyzing data collected by surveying crews over the last 60 years , they have determined that the coastline bordering the subduction zone has warped significantly over that period . This suggests the subduction zone is locked and building up strain as it bends the edge of the North American plate . At some point the plate will snap back , Vincent says . <p> While the recent reports have convinced many researchers that the Cascadia subduction zone will someday unleash a huge quake , some find the evidence lacking . <p> " I tend to be a little bit skeptical of the evidence as it stands right now , " says University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably did cause the submergence features found along the coast , Crosson says he wonders if they were moderate offshore quakes instead of huge subduction shocks . Even so , he thinks there is a high probability that the Northwest does indeed suffer subduction quakes . <p> Seismologist Lynn Sykes of Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades , N.Y. , takes a dimmer view , saying he 's dubious about the potential for a Cascadia subduction earthquake . <p> Sykes bases his position on theories of how rocks fracture . The recipe for a subduction quake calls for strong rocks lining the interface between the overriding and subducting plates . As these rocks lock together , they must resist the motion of the plates and store up elastic strain for several centuries . In the case of the Cascadia subduction zone , however , most portions of the interface are far too weak to build up enough strain for a huge earthquake , Sykes maintains . <p> Seismologist Tom Heaton disagrees . " I think the materials underneath the continental margin are perfectly strong enough to make a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " until someone sees one of these earthquakes , the debate will never be settled . " Heaton , of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , was one of the first to raise concerns about quake potential in the Cascadia subduction zone ( SN : 4/27/85 , p.270 ) . <p> But public officials can not wait for seismic devastation to settle the debate , and will have to make practical decisions based on the kinds of information scientists are currently gathering . <p> For Seattle school administrators , the threat of unreinforced masonry walls might seem small compared with other concerns , such as the growing drug problem and the epidemic of teen pregnancies gripping most urban areas . Yet when Atwater thinks about his daughter 's school , the seismic signs appear clear enough to prompt action . " The evidence in hand right now favors the hypothesis that great earthquakes can happen here , " he says . " The cautious approach as far as seismic hazard is concerned is to view these earthquakes as a real possibility . " <p> MAP : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean floor dive beneath the North American plate along the Cascadia subduction zone , an offshore region running northward from Cape Medocino , Calif. , to Vancouver Island , British Columbia . <p> MAP : A slice through the Earth shows the Juan de Fuca plate subducting under North America . Some scientists think the two plates have stuck together and will not move until accumulating pressure suddenly forces them to slip , generating a catastrophic earthquake . Shaded bar under North American plate highlights the interface between plates . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Ghost forest : Although they died centuries ago , these red cedars still stand along the Washington coastline . Their roots sit in soil buried under a layer of tidal mud , which indicates the trees died when the field dropped below the high-tide level . Since that time , the ground has risen above water level again . <p> By Richard Monastersky <p> If the Big North One hits <p> As more scientists become convinced that a giant earthquake could strike the Pacific Northwest , public officials face some tough choices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ore. , says much of his city could come down during a magnitude 8 shock , which would pack about 30 times more energy than last October 's Loma Prieta quake in northern California . <p> After surveying seismic destruction in Mexico City and in the Bay area , McGarrigle says , " I expect to see significant damage . I expect to see about 10 percent of the structures in our area have major collapses , and another 10 percent have significant structural damage , and a lot of our bridges go down or partially go down . " <p> People in Portland and many other parts of Oregon have never worried about strong earthquakes , he says , mostly because no major shock has struck the area since Europeans first settled there in the early 1800s . On the Uniform Building Code scale of 0 to 4 ( which sets constuction standards for new buildings but not for other structures such as bridges and dams ) , Portland has been assigned a 2 . San Francisco and Los Angeles , in contrast , have a code of 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some lessons learned from moderate quakes in 1949 and 1965 , says structural engineer James Carpenter , who heads a committee on seismic preparedness for the Seattle-based Structural Engineers Association of Washington . The Uniform Building Code for Seattle is 3 , and includes an important ductility provision requiring elements in new buildings to withstand a significant amount of bending . <p> Yet even these provisions might not suffice during a magnitude 8 quake , which would shake the city for perhaps a minute  --  an exceedingly long time compared with the 10- to 15-second shudder of smaller quakes . " The long duration is really going to be a killer , " says Paul Somerville , a seismologist with Woodward-Clyde Consultants in Pasadena , Calif . <p> While all this sounds dire , the possibility remains that a subduction zone quake might not strike for several hundred years . The current scientific uncertainty regarding the superquake 's timing forces officials to ponder some difficult questions . Should cities and towns spend precious funds on a risk that may lie decades away ? Should regulations force landlords to strengthen older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that have witnessed a dramatic increase in homeless populations over the last decade ? <p> Neil Hawkins , a structural engineer at the University of Washington , thinks the risks are great enough to warrant action , especially since seismologists say the magnitude 6 and 7 quakes that shook Seattle in midcentury could recur about every 100 years and may strike elsewhere in the Northwest . Hawkins contends that most northwestern population centers  --  including Seattle  --  have failed to prepare for even moderate shocks such as these . <p> " These ones are much more frequent than the subduction quakes , and we know they are going to occur , " he says . " No one is going to argue about that . Yet I do n't believe the level of awareness has reached the stage where people accept the fact we should be almost as well prepared as California .
