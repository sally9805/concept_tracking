My new wife took very few possessions with her when she left Peru , mostly blouses and books and clumps of the hot pepper aji wrapped in cellophane , but she did remember to pack her photograph of her father . It was a cloudy black-and-white shot taken in 1960 on his fifty-fourth birthday , two years before his daughter was born , nine years before his death . Somehow during her first confusing days in the States , my wife managed to lose the picture , frame and all . ( It was the one irreplaceable thing she brought , and typically , it was the one thing she lost . ) <p> She instantly wrote to her mother in Lima , asking for another one . Her mother responded with a very stern and disapproving not , warning her daughter that she 'd better learn to hold on to things , especially things as precious and rare as photos of her father . And no , she did not have any more pictures to send . <p> The truth was that there really were just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in existence . He had disliked being photographed . He had probably been acutely self-conscious , like most ungainly , unattractive people . My wife would only say that he had had bad eyes , had had surgery for cataracts , and that the afterimage of a camera flash stayed with him for days . But she was sure . that her brother Andres  --  her older , more responsible brother , who had left Peru years before and was now living in Spain  --  would have a photograph of their father , or else he would know where to get one . Andres had special qualities , including a highly resourceful nature and the twin gifts of survival and serendipity  --  characteristics my wife claimed he shared with all the men on their father 's side of the family , excepting of course their father . <p> So she wrote to her brother , who was living in Madrid , and gave a long ; explanation on the events that led to the loss of her one photograph of their father . " Permanently misplaced " was the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he  --  Andres  --  might have a spare photograph somewhere , it could even be a photo where their father was part of a group , so long , of course , as his back was n't turned to the camera , so long as he was recognizable . And if he did n't have a photo to send her , did he know , did he remember , someone else she could ask ? At the very end , she told him not to send his only photograph , not that she expected him to , but she knew how generous he could be . If only one of them could have him , it should be her brother and not her , the son and not the daughter . <p> The letter to her brother had to be forwarded a couple of times . He had moved from the Calle de Alcala , and when the letter got to the forwarding address on the Calle Zurbano , it was sent on to a third address on the Calle de las Infantas . So he explained in his reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph enclosed . He apologized . He said that he had n't brought any family pictures with him , just a photo of his old girlfriend , Maria , who had stopped writing to him a long time before and whom he suspected to be engaged or married or maybe even a mother already . To hell with her ! As to where his sister might be able to come by a photograph of their father , he was n't altogether sure , he had been out of touch for so long , but he suggested trying Tia Francesca , their father 's first cousin and probably the most likely person other than their mother to be in possession of family mementos and the like . <p> My wife sat down and wrote him a short note , thanking him for his reply and letting him know that Tia Francesca had died of vital pneumonia two summers before . <p> She wrote to a long list of people , explaining her search for her father 's photograph . Her cousin in Chile . Another cousin in Montreak Her great-aunt in Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lima ( they must please promise not to tell her mother because this was being done as a surprise for her ) . She wrote to the Lima newspaper El Tiempo , asking for a copy of her father 's obituary notice and the accompanying photograph she remembered seeing once ( she enclosed twenty U.S. dollars for mailing costs ) . She even wrote to a nunnery in Arequipa  --  her father 's only sister had lived and died there , back in the 1930s , and he had sent annual donations for Hail Marys to be said  --  requesting a copy of his photograph she thought they might be keeping in a special donor file . <p> It was the first time in her life she 'd been without a photograph of her father , or without any real prospects for getting one . <p> His image had been one of the great props of her childhood . She played with his picture , talked to it , slept with it pressed between her knees . He was a living presence , a cross between a guardian angel sitting astride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant city and communicated through secret subliminal messages . She received " invisible letters " from him that she collected and hid in the mouths of her stuffed animals . She had fantasies in which the picture would come to life  --  lifting these , probably , from Mexican horror movies that appeared regularly on late-night television  --  in which the lips would move , the eyes would dance , the whole head would move from side to side . Certain attributes of the baby Jesus she passed on to him , and she mixed the two faces in her mind , her father 's face and Christ 's , not knowing you were n't supposed to do this until a nun at her parochial school asked her to explain a drawing she had done . Thirty paddle whacks on her right hand every day for a month was her penance . <p> She even prayed directly to his photograph , asking for toys and very specific wishes to be granted ( things like going to the beach , or getting a hula hoop ) , until her mother discovered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , Son , Holy Ghost , Virgin Mary , or a regulation saint . <p> Twice during her adolescent years the picture fell . The first time occurred during a minor early morning tremor when my wife was eight . At the first sign of the terremoto , she ran out into the street , joined there by mothers hoisting up crying babies , men with shampoo still in their hair , wailing maids clutching crucifixes , dogs paralyzed with fear . When she returned to her room , she saw that the quake had caused the picture to fall off her bureau ; the frame stayed intact , but the glass plate had cracked . The maid lectured her nonstop for two days  --  next time , REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR FATHER . <p> The glass was replaced the very next day . Much in the house they were then living in was badly in need of repair , including the oven , the front door , and the part of the roof that overhung the kitchen , but intact housing for her father 's photograph was obviously considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her eleventh birthday . She had just received a shiny new transistor radio , and she pushed the picture back to make room for it on her bureau . The picture hit the wall first , then the edge of a night table , then the floor . The glass shattered and the top of the frame was dented . Worst of all , a sliver of glass somehow sliced part of the photograph , creating a tear just below her father 's neck . The maid despaired when she saw it . HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOUR FATHER ?  --  as though not just the sacred preservation of his memory but his actual physical welfare rested with her . But a few days later , the frame was repaired , the photograph restored , and the whole thing returned to its customary place . <p> All there was was his photograph . <p> Her mother never talked about him . Relatives never referred to him . As she grew older , she sensed more and more the terrible bad luck and the precipitous plunge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever told her anything , she had to glean bits and pieces from overheard conversations and papers her mother left lying around . She was fourteen by the time she learned the true circumstances of his death , that he had collapsed and died instantly while walking on the Jiron de la Union in downtown Lima , that he had fallen so strangely and brutally that his head split open and had to be sewn up with fishing line so they could prepare him for the wake . It took her four more years to discover that after his death , his business partner appropriated certain assets  --  including a blind share in a cattle farm  --  produced certain buyout-in-case-of-death documents and discounted others , asserted that my wife 's father owed nearly one million soles he had borrowed from the business ( again , there was no record of this ) , and declared himself the single legitimate executor of his partner 's business legacy . <p> There are contradictory facts , whole years unaccounted for . The only sure thing was that her father had died and everything seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the central theme . She did find out that in the year right after his death , her mother sold their fifteen-room house to a man who knocked on the front door and asked for it , sold their Packard convertible , sold their antiques , sold jewelry and other assorted valuables , all for a fraction of their true worth . <p> Through the years , the picture of her father went from bigger houses to smaller houses to cramped apartments on the ground floor of faded avenues , where in the afternoons the dust thickened anti coated the windows and mirrors , the way dust dares to be omnipresent in the lesser neighborhoods of a city . It was as though the picture were following her from place to place , sometimes even arriving ahead of her . She 'd walk into the new bedroom of their new address , or the bedroom she would have to share with the one maid they managed to retain , and there it was , set in silver , staring ahead resolutely and forlornly , waiting for her . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 1981-82 , a few days after Christmas , she was barely twenty years old . <p> I was working for a struggling travel company headquartered in Miami that saw tourism to Peru as its last chance for salvation ; she was working for a Lima translation services agency , where her fluency in English put her in contact with a lot of Europeans and , to a much lesser extent , North Americans . I came in every day , at first with real translating work to be done and then with made-up work that gave me an excuse to come by . She was very serious for a long time about not wanting to have anything to do with me . North Americans did n't interest her . Being Swiss or French or German was far more compelling in her eyes . <p> We slowly began a kind of relationship . I 'd sit on the steps of her office building and wait for her to come out , and if I was lucky , she 'd let me walk with her a little ways , maybe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was shy and reserved , and volunteered no real information about herself . After a month and a half , I knew that she lived in a neighborhood somewhere near the national futbol stadium . I knew her brother had gone to Spain and sent her a postcard of the Alhambra Palace from Granada . I knew she liked the Beatles . That was about it . In time , we began going out on official " dates , " and I met her mother and her two live-in spinster aunts , Beni and Corazon , and saw the inside of their apartment with its rose-patterned curtains and chair coverings , lace tablecloths , and birds of paradise flowers in a vase in the center of the small sitting area . The air was stale and sweet , and I remember thinking how it seemed such a stifling atmosphere for a man . <p> One day , I finally asked about meeting her father , and she told me not to worry , there would be plenty of time for that . <p> It became a kind of running routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask her , " Is that him ? " I told her she was making me very nervous  --  could n't I just meet him and get it over with ? Or did he not want to meet me ? Did he disapprove of me ? <p> I was going to ask her to marry me  --  I decided this after knowing her for less than three months  --  and I knew I needed her father 's permission . I had talked to several Peruvians , and they all fold me there was no way around it . You must ask the father for the daughter 's hand . So one day , I pushed and pushed , and insisted that I had to see her father that night . I would wait no longer . <p> " All right , " she said in English . " Come to my apartment at seven o'clock . " <p> I arrived early , and sprawled on a stone wall across the street from their building , smoking cigarettes , practicing my lines in Spanish . Yo amo su hija  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard worker . Tengo una pregunta muy importante para usted  --  I have a very important question for you . <p> At seven en punto , I rang the bell , got buzzed in , and climbed the steps to the third floor . She was out on the landing waiting for me . Without saying a word , she took my hand and brought me through the dead silence of the apartment into her bedroom . It was a very small room with one window . There were two beds , with just inches between them : one for her , one for Beni . ( The last of their maids had been let go by this point . ) There was one antique chiffonier , and standing on its narrow ledge was a framed photograph . <p> She picked it up and , as though making an offering , held it out for me to take . <p> " Here , " she said in English . " Here he is . He has been waiting the whole day to talk to you . " <p> One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andres and no one else , and after my wife began to approach a sense of resignation about the whole thing , an oversized envelope arrived , a warning scrawled on the envelope both in English and Spanish : DO NOT BEND and NO DOBLAR . Inside was a brief letter attached by paper clip to a medium-sized photograph . The letter was unsigned . My wife noticed right away that it was not written in her mother 's frenzied script , or by her brother 's childish hand , or in any other style she recognized . <p> The letter simply said that enclosed was a picture of my wife 's father from the year 1927 . That would make him twenty-one in this picture , the letter writer said , more or less the same age my wife was now . ( Whoever it was , they knew her current age . ) It was an original photo , so my wife must treat it with the utmost care , she must watch over it and regard it as her most prized possession . <p> In the photo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind that was a blurred dark line that must have been a wrought-iron railing . My wife guessed that this might be somewhere in old Miraflores , on one of the side streets that runs behind Avenue Benavides . She began naming a few of the streets , considering each of them . I told her it did n't matter that much , this whole business of figuring out just where he had been standing that particular day , but she was very determined to settle the matter . <p> After she had convinced herself of the probable location  --  the third block of Grimaldo del Solar  --  she turned her attention to the man in the photo . At first , she declared that it was n't her father . She was sure . Too thin , too toothy . Wrong expression . Wrong posture . <p> She put the picture down and walked into another room . Then she came back and leaned over the picture for a long time . Very softly , she admitted that it might be him , after all . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . He was wearing a white short-sleeved dress shirt and pants that were so pale they appeared to have no color . He resembled one of those jungle insects that melts into its surroundings . I even thought I saw a certain look  --  the shimmer in the eyes , maybe , the romantic attraction to the unknown  --  that sometimes appeared on my wife 's face . <p> He was still single in the new photograph . He was healthy . He was clear-eyed . He was not afraid of the camera . He smiled agreeably . He invited the photographer to take his or her time , to line up the shot . He had the look very young men tend to have in photographs  --  confident , undoubting , happily blind to the future . <p> It was hard for my wife to accept an image of her father as a young man , one that was not in accordance with her finely tuned impression of him . In her mind , he was a much older man ; he was born at a certain age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to see his face without lines , his mouth so expressive , his hair full and black . <p> Still , she had the photograph framed and put it on the night-stand next to our bed . At first , she kept her distance . She seemed to be sizing him up , and in fact , the reverse also seemed to be true , that he was wary and slightly afraid of her as well . Many nights , I 'd find the frame obscured by piles of books or magazines , or thoughtlessly turned so it faced the wall . It was only gradually that she began to approach him freely , to admire him at close range , to hold him in her two hands and smile at his smooth , untroubled face . <p> The day her father died , she was sitting in her second-grade classroom , between Balbina Velasco and Alfonso Garcia , in the dead , unmoving air of the afternoon session , when her father 's driver , Edmund , appeared at the half-open classroom door . The teacher conferred with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told my wife to gather her things , put them in her satchel , and go with Senor Edmund . He walked her out to her father 's car , a big green Packard , and as soon as she saw that no one was sitting in the back seat of that shiny hulk , she knew instantly and intuitively that her father was dead . She started to scream , Quiero mi papi ! and Edmund had to throw his hand over her mouth and plead with her to stop . He had been given explicit instructions from her grandmother not to say anything to the poor little girl  --  she was n't supposed to know yet . When he told her this , she somehow dried her eyes and actually and truly made herself forget her terrible newfound knowledge , suppressing it for what turned out to be a reasonable number of hours , all for the sake of keeping the chauffeur out of trouble . <p> A couple of days later , they had to fire him . He had no one to drive anymore . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She dreamed about him . She heard his voice . If a car stopped at the house , she was sure it would be him , it would be Edmund . If the phone rang , she expected to hear his soothing , familiar voice on the other end . <p> It took time , almost a full year , before she forgot all about him . <p> <p> By PETER GORDON <p> PETER GORDON 's work has appeared in The Yale Review , the New Yorker , The North American Review , The Antioch review , Glimmer Train , and elsewhere .
