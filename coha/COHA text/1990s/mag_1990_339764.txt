George Bush concluded after the shipboard summit in Malta that the time had come for him to join in an enterprise that Mikhail Gorbachev has called " new political thinking . " It was a sentiment worthy of a New Year 's resolution , and a new decade 's . So far , Gorbachev has had a near monopoly on the promulgation of bold ideas . Bush 's main contribution has been an appeal for Western policy to move " beyond containment . " That phrase , which he hoped would be the slogan of the year , sounded all right when he first enunciated it last spring , but that was a long time ago . Since then Gorbachev 's initiatives and the events they have triggered have made containment sound like such an anachronism that the need to move beyond it is self-evident . Last week 's U.S. invasion of Panama was a case in point . It was Uncle Sam 's first major post- containment military operation ; neither the ghost of President James Monroe nor a single live communist was anywhere in sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-term future because the short term is so uncertain . No sooner did they decide on affirmative answers to their initial questions about Gorbachev  --  Is he for real ? Is he good for us ?  --  than they started worrying , Will he last ? Will he succeed ? What happens , and who takes his place , if he does n't ? <P> Such questions are by definition unanswerable except with qualified guesses . What are the chances of rain tomorrow ? Forty percent . Better take an umbrella . What are the chances of the Big One sometime in the next 30 years if you live along the San Andreas fault ? High enough that you 'd better check your insurance policy ; make sure it covers acts of God . Gorbachev is to political earthquakes what matadors are to bulls . Wondering about what will happen to him  --  or because of him  --  is unlikely to inspire boldness in someone so naturally cautious and prone to overinsurance as George Bush . That , in essence , is what happened in 1989 . <P> Whether Gorbachev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But the world should not need to await the outcome of what he is trying to do to see the significance of what he has already done : he has accelerated history , making possible the end of one of its most disreputable episodes , the imposition of a cruel and unnatural order on hundreds of millions of people . Sooner or later , their despair and defiance would have reached critical mass . But the explosion occurred this year , much sooner and more spectacularly than anyone had predicted , because the people had in Gorbachev the most powerful ally imaginable . <P> Perhaps just as important , the Gorbachev phenomenon may have a transforming effect outside the communist world , on the perceptions and therefore the policies of the West . Watching him ought to inspire , in addition to awe , suspense and admiration , an epiphany about what his fellow citizens call , with increasing irony , anger and impatience , " Soviet reality . " Gorbachev 's determination to restructure that reality should induce Westerners to practice a kind of reverse engineering on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour should be not just , What next ? but , Knowing what we know now , having seen what we have seen this year , how should we revise our understanding of the Soviet challenge ?
