ONE , BY ONE , BY ONE : FACING THE HOLOCAUST <P> by Judith Miller ; Simon &; Schuster <P> 319 pages ; $21.95 <P> Judith Miller 's challenging thesis is that many countries remember the Holocaust in different ways , and from these different perceptions come different distortions of what the Holocaust actually was . A veteran reporter and editor for the New York Times , Miller pursues her thesis over a lot of familiar terrain  --  the Barbie trial , the Waldheim election  --  but when she ventures off the beaten track , which she does fairly often , she discovers some very interesting things . Like the fact that the Dutch government still pays a pension of about $11,000 a year to the widow of the country 's deputy Nazi leader during the German Occupation , and that she unrepentantly spends part of the money to distribute neo-Nazi propaganda . Or that the monument the Soviets reluctantly built at Babi Yar is actually half a mile away from the ravine where thousands of Jews were slaughtered , and that in the process of building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Miller explores the collective memories of six countries and finds them all in various ways deceptive . The West Germans have made some amends , but they have forgotten too much ; the Austrians deny they were Hitler 's willing accomplices ; the Dutch idolize Anne Frank but overlook the fact that she was betrayed by one of the many Dutch collaborators ; the French cherish the myth of the heroic Resistance but began mistreating Jews well before the Nazis asked them to do so ; the Soviets steadfastly denigrate the Jewishness of most Holocaust victims ; and all too many Americans are turning memories of the Holocaust into a vulgar fund-raising carnival . <P> All of that is more or less true , but there are some strange gaps in Miller 's indictment . One is Poland , where most of the victims lived and most of the killing actually occurred , and where the poison of anti-Semitism was still visible last year in Jozef Cardinal Glemp 's resistance to the removal of a Carmelite installation at Auschwitz . The other is Israel , which probably would not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6 million dead as justification for whatever actions it undertakes . <P> Strangest of all , while Miller devotes most of her chapters mainly to Gentile distortions and evasions , she writes about American reactions as though the Holocaust were purely a Jewish question . " While it is now evident that the United States did not do enough to prevent the genocide in Europe . . . the Holocaust is not an American experience , " she claims . " Americans did not do it , nor were they its targets or victims . " But it was President Roosevelt who did nothing to increase the immigration quotas , and the State Department that refused to fill even those narrow quotas , and the U.S. Congress that rejected a measure to allow in 20,000 children . And when Jewish leaders pleaded for Allied bombers to knock out the railroad lines to Auschwitz , Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy responded , " I am very chary of getting the army involved in this . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
