<p> Savannah - With coupons in hand and 4-year-old son Seth in tow Super Markets and Kroger . <p> In a skirmish foreshadowing all-out war between the two chains in Atlanta , Publix and Kroger last month opened big , sparkling stores side by side southwest of Savannah . <p> Publix has no stores in Atlanta yet , but it 's planning a major assault into the market , where Kroger is the top chain with nearly 40 percent of the grocery business . <p> In Savannah , all that separates the Publix and Kroger stores is a small street , aptly named Apache Avenue . <p> Early on , Publix slashed prices on Coca-Cola , and Kroger offered triple coupons . Free samples of food flowed in both stores . Kroger parked a red Wells Fargo armored truck out front and pasted banners on it reading , " Win ! $ 10,000 Cash Price Giveaway . " <p> " It 's like a food war , " said Mrs. Walker , 28 , shopping in Kroger recently , after a few visits to Publix. ; New battleground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Savannah , they will cake it on when Publix hits the warpath in metro Atlanta . <p> For shoppers , Publix 's large , upscale stores will be yet another choice among a dizzying array of options - including traditional markets , no-frills warehouses and farmers markets . <p> Atlanta 's vast and competitive market could well be the toughest challenge yet for Publix , which plans to start opening stores in northern Atlanta as early as late 1992 . <p> " I do n't think you are going to see Kroger tuck tail and run , " said Bob Beverly , vice president of Crim &; Associates , an Atlanta-based developer . <p> In recent years , Kroger has built up its Atlanta market share by opening and renovating stores , and offering a wide variety of services , from banking to video rentals. ; Dazzling rival <p> But in Savannah , Publix 's 65,000-square-foot store dazzles , compared with Kroger 's conventional supermarket next door . Unlike the relatively low ceilings in Kroger , the Publix store is open to the rafters , and light pouring through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publix , a cafe offers sit-down service and fresh flowers on the tables . In the bakery , deli and meat department , employees prepare food in clear view of shoppers , as part of Publix 's emphasis on building rapport with the public . Oranges , tomatoes and apples are shiny and piled high . <p> Although Publix accepts coupons , runs specials and has competitive prices , it has more of a reputation for service . Customer-friendly signs are posted throughout the store - such as one in the meat department that reads , " We gladly break packages . " <p> The Savannah store is Publix 's first outside of Florida . Its push into Atlanta is the start of what the chain plans to be a major expansion across the Southeast . <p> For now , Publix is releasing few details about its Atlanta plans , except to say it wants to be a dominant player in the roughly $ 4 billion- a-year grocery market . <p> Meanwhile , Kroger refuses to discuss how it will compete with Publix . <p> Initially , Publix 's search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ublix said it has selected four sites in Cobb and Gwinnett counties , although deals have n't been signed . <p> One of the sites - currently a trashy lot at Johnson Ferry Road and Woodlawn Drive in Cobb County - is surrounded by Kroger , Big Star and Bruno 's Finer Foods stores . <p> " We always try to get close to the competition so we can go head to head , " said Publix spokesman Bob McDermott . <p> If that indeed happens , Publix will be squaring off against Kroger throughout metro Atlanta . But because both chains are strong , they are likely to survive the fight , industry experts said . <p> Smaller operators , however , could suffer , if Publix quickly opens the 30 or more stores it needs to become a dominant chain , developers and retailers said . <p> " A &P; and Big Star are going to really suffer , " said Mr. Beverly , of Crim &; Associates . " They do n't have the wherewithal to create more of a presence . " <p> An A &P; spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star spokesman Donald Vaillancourt said the chain 's 42 stores in metro Atlanta are firmly established . Like Kroger and other chains , Big Star is active in the community , with programs that help schools buy computers and make donations to the Atlanta Food Bank. ; Initial obstacles <p> Meanwhile , Publix has hit some snags in Atlanta . Community opposition has scuttled plans for a store in western Cobb County . And with the severe credit crunch , many developers are having trouble financing strip centers , possibly slowing the rollout of Publix stores . <p> But if Publix 's bold plan for Atlanta succeeds , developers said , it could lead to the most tumultuous changes in Atlanta supermarkets in a decade . <p> At that time , Kroger began rolling out " combination " grocery stores featuring pharmacies . Big Star and others began clustering delis , wine shops and other specialty food " boutiques " around the walls of their stores . <p> While common now , such innovations led to the demise of Food Giant , which had been a dominant Atlanta grocer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now rivals are waiting for Publix to make its move . <p> " You have to hope Publix has something up its sleeve , " James Hood , executive editor of Shelby Report of the Southeast , an industry publication . " You have to do something really special in Atlanta to attract shoppers . "
