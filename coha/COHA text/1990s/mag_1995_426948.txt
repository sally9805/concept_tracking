Section : World report Japan &; The World Japan 's economy shows signs of a breakdown <p> As dusk descends on Roppongi , colorful neon lights disguise the drab facade of Tokyo 's bar-hopping district . Even after a long recession , Roppongi still buzzes at night . Recently , dozens of yellow-and-black signs bearing the name " Times " have joined the jumble , touting Tokyo 's latest growth industry : parking lots . <p> In four years , Times Parking has made a small fortune paving over some of the world 's most expensive real estate  --  much of it bank collateral for bad loans  --  and charging 100 yen , about a dollar , to park for 20 minutes . So far , Times has converted 600 vacant , weedy sites in Tokyo alone . " Even if you build on these sites , there are no tenants , " says Kiyoshi Nishikawa , president of Times . " And as land prices go down , it is good business for us . " <p> The rest of Japan is less fortunate . Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unstoppable powerhouse , ready to conquer markets everywhere . The value of the Tokyo Stock Exchange cruised past Wall Street . Japan 's land , slightly smaller than California , was worth four times America 's vast continental expanse . Articles and books hailed Japan 's economy , its education system and the government 's micromanagement of finance and business . Japanese bemoaned America 's ills . <p> Breakdown . No longer . After four years of recession and a shattering plunge in land prices , Japan 's old economic and government system shows signs of a breakdown . Government agencies have passed the buck for three years as the disaster in Japan 's banking system spilled slowly into international markets . Unemployment is creeping up , especially among young people . Japan 's corporations are a generation behind in key areas of technology . Even if the economy begins to recover slowly , as some expect may happen next year , the days are over when Japan could serve as a model for America or Asia . <p> Akiyoshi Inoue , president of an independent land appraisal company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astonishing statistic : Tokyo land prices have already plummeted more than 80 percent below bank collateral values assigned just a few years ago . Inoue predicts the huge overhang of supply will push land prices down to 10 percent of peak value before hitting a bottom with a thud that will devastate bank balance sheets . <p> The steady rise of land prices in post-World War II Japan reflected boundless optimism about the country 's future . Now , argues economist Yukio Noguchi , land prices have more than erased the gains of the fantastic bull market of the 1980s for a simple reason : Expectations for Japan 's future have collapsed . <p> As land prices plummet , Japan 's wealth is vanishing . The Bank of Japan estimates that by last year unrealized capital gains on land and stock held by Japanese corporations had fallen more than two thirds from the peak of 1989 , punching holes in a key financial-security cushion . Bankruptcies are rising , and surviving companies that are nursing broken balance sheets have chilled the environment for investing . <p> Deflation . Katsuhei Kojima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Los Angeles . " These are very cheap , " he says . Six years ago the flamboyant head of Japan 's fastest-growing chain of discount retailers ordered a custom-made stretch Toyota Century , the stodgy luxury car long favored by Japanese executives . Now Kojima is considering importing an American-made limo to use at a wedding hall he owns . <p> Kojima knows a lot about cheap imports . In just a few months , Kojima , whose stores bear his name , has revolutionized the Japanese market for refrigerators by bucking the conventional wisdom that finicky Japanese consumers wo n't buy goods made for foreign tastes . In June , Kojima agreed to buy 100,000 refrigerators a year from General Electric , many imported directly from San Diego . In 4 1/2 months , he sold 57,000 GE fridges , grabbing 3 percent of the market . Kojima plugs GE machines as a slice of American life : open and simple , compared with the fussy drawers and doors of Japanese brands . But he has another selling point : Prices are as much as two-thirds cheaper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices in response . With profits squeezed , in time they are likely to join the growing ranks of manufacturers forced to move production overseas to lower costs . <p> Kojima 's story is just the latest case of what Japanese call " price destruction "  --  discounting that has rolled through one seemingly protected market after another , from toys , personal computers and beer to apples , televisions and audio equipment . Cars may be next . Economists use a different word : deflation . Japan is the first industrialized country to suffer general deflation since the Great Depression of the 1930s . As the artificial protections from foreign competition enjoyed by Japanese manufacturers have gradually collapsed , prices have fallen  --  along with the competitive power of manufacturers and the job-creating power of the economy . <p> Japan has managed to hold official unemployment to just 3.2 percent , although even this is a record high . Companies have helped spread the pain of recession by keeping underemployed workers  --  often the middle-aged family breadwinner  --  on the payroll ( column , Page 72 ) . One result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while American companies have steamed ahead . Japanese statistics also understate the real level of unemployment , which if recalculated to include workers who have given up looking for jobs may be as high as 10 percent . Many of these are women . Perhaps most painful , the jobless rate for those under 25 is twice the average as companies keep excess older workers and stop hiring young ones . <p> " The big companies now take only a few people , " laments Tadashi Yamakawa , director of the Tokyo Student Employment Center . " It is impossible for all students to find jobs . " Use of the center , which helps students who fail to find jobs through university recruitment offices , has more than quadrupled since 1992 . On a recent afternoon , the center , just north of Tokyo 's main business district , was packed with anxious graduating students browsing through files of job offers . " I never imagined it would be this difficult , " says a finance major from a Tokyo university who sent out over 100 unsuccessful applications . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prefecture in northern Japan are alive with autumn reds and yellows . Hajime Sasaki pulls daikon radishes from the rain-soaked earth , slices off their leafy heads and prepares them for the smokehouse behind his home , where they will be transformed into delicate pickles to eat with soft Japanese rice . <p> Sasaki is an organic farmer who sells over 25 varieties of vegetables to a regional supermarket chain . He believes passionately in his work , but he is pessimistic about the future . <p> " My son works at a survey company nearby , and I would like him to succeed me on the farm , " says Sasaki . " But I do n't want him to have such a difficult life . " <p> Sasaki and his fellow farmers are a hothouse species whose shield from the cold wind of international trade is slowly eroding . They pay the highest prices inthe world for fertilizer and agriculture machinery purchased through the local agricultural cooperative  --  the bottom link of a powerful national bureaucracy that has been a key base of support for Japan 's conservative Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers are in effect kept alive by a huge tax on Japan 's urban consumers , who are now flocking to buy cheap imported food . The outlook is so bleak that farmland prices in Akita have fallen by over two thirds in the past decade . " Farmers used to fight like crazy when the local government took their land to build roads , " says Sasaki . " Now , they are happy to take the money and retire . " <p> These days , farmers have a fresh worry . The same agricultural cooperatives that sell farm supplies , buy produce , lend money to farmers and rally the vote for the LDP also invested some $50 billion of farmers ' savings in seven insolvent Housing Loan ( Jusen ) corporations . The firms squandered $84 billion on resort projects that went bust . Burned banks and agricultural cooperatives have argued for three years over who will foot the cleanup bill . " We are not prepared to accept any loss to the principal of our loans , " says Masahiro Sato , counselor to the Fukushima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could face lawsuits from shareholders if they agree to accept a disproportionate share of losses . Meanwhile , urban voters , disgusted by the financial mess , are dead set against letting the government spend their money to solve the problem . The result has been years of policy gridlock , while a festering sore spreads slowly throughout the banking system , undermining confidence . " The center of government is paralyzed , " admits a senior financial official . Japanese banks now pay a " Japan premium "  --  an interest rate more than half a percentage point higher on international loans  --  because of a perceived higher risk . <p> Financial collapse , while unlikely , is no longer unthinkable . Indeed , after five bank failures in the past year and the Daiwa Bank debacle in New York , the financial system is stripped of its defenses , highly vulnerable in the event of a surprise bank failure or scandal . <p> Japan 's economy has its bright spots . Electronics companies have caught the wave of America 's technology revolution and are making good profits in semiconductors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generates orders for Japanese machine tools and industrial robots . And even as international confidence in Japan 's banks fades , many analysts see some light at the horizon . One Bank of Japan economist  --  until recently a perennial pessimist  --  argues that between record-low interest rates , the recent weakening of the yen and a $140 billion government spending package , a self-sustained recovery will take hold next year . Yet even this " optimist " predicts Japanese unemployment will double within five years . And he argues that recovery will be weak if not accompanied by sweeping deregulation . <p> That is Japan 's paradox : While the country boasts some of the world 's greatest companies , average productivity is low because bureaucrats protect so many industries from competition . " The current system has served the people in power very well , " says Akio Mikuni , president of an independent credit-rating agency . " And people in charge believe the system is still working . " He doubts there can be change without a crisis . Yet even if recovery takes hold , predicts economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and the rest of Asia . At the very least , Japan 's economic challenge to America is beginning to resemble land prices in Roppongi : grossly inflated . Boom and bust <p> Japan 's economy , once considered invincible , has fallen on hard times . TABLE Nikkei stock index TABLE <p> Note : Annual figures , except 1995 , which is latest .
