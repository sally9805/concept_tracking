Our field  --  dare I say profession ?  --  has a certain image in the eyes of the public . However , I believe strongly that we must now take bold , positive steps to present a much sharper , more precise image to those who use our services ( e.g. , students , clients ) . Such a change must necessarily be accompanied by a concomitant delineation of the specific competencies possessed by graduates of our professional preparation programs . Why do I say this ? How did I come to this conclusion more than a generation ago ? <p> I am now extremely close to the end of a very long career in a field that I have consistently called some combination of the terms physical education , health , sport/ athletics , and recreation . What i called myself professionally down through the years had a direct relationship to the name of the department , division , school , college , or organization to which I was attached . This was only common sense . <p> Early on , however , I recognized the illogicality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe it . But I reasoned that this dilemma would in time somehow straighten itself out . At times , in academic circles or in confronting the public , I winced just a tiny bit when I was asked what field I was in . I never turned traitor and avoided using the term " physical education , " but I often embellished it with the word " athletics , " or explained that I was especially concerned with the history , philosophy , and managerial aspects of physical education and sport . The North American public fully understood the term " sport , " but typically had many mis-conceptions about what physical education was supposed to be . Presumably they were remembering the type of program they had as children and young people . Also , people immediately understood it when I got down on the floor and did a push-up . <p> Despite my loyalty to our seemingly eternally " developing " profession , the term " physical education , " and my occasional muscular demonstration to lighten the discussion , one other aspect of this overall problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own **37;657;TOOLONG orientation was such that I could never accept the tripartite human postulated by those espousing the then predominant Judeo-Christian tradition of North America . Early on I reasoned that the human being was indeed a uniified organism , and I found substantive support for this belief in the rapidly developing field of psychology . <p> Well , today I recognize sadly that the image that our field presents and the accompanying dilemma as to what to call ourselves has not cleared itself up over the last 50 years . For many reasons it simply has not been able to do so . In fact , the situation has now ballooned into a whirling vortex of more than 150 names in the United States that describe what personnel at the college and university level think our field is all about . <p> And , as indicated above , and difficult as it may be for some to accept , there is every reason to believe that our past and present professional practitioners have still not initially mastered a consensual ( i.e. , agreed-upon ) body of knowledge and skills about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What general and specific competencies do our graduates possess ? Who knows ? <p> Moreover , because we have not provided a means to do it , there is every reason to believe also that these graduates  --  now practitioners !  --  are not keeping up with expanding knowledge about their field when on the job . Frankly , this is a further issue that we should come to grips with right now . After all these years , we are still typically " jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none ! " This is what we have been , and this is what we presently are . Can we possibly argue that this is how it should be in the future ? <p> I firmly believe this situation should be changed as rapidly as possible . After many years I have now come to believe that the profession ( is it a reasonably UNITED entity ? ) has a duty and responsibility ( 1 ) to work its way through to an appropriate name and ( 2 ) to develop a consensual taxonomy of knowledge , skills , and competencies for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) we need to put our money where our mouth is and help to fund scholarship and research regularly to move this body of knowledge forward , and ( 4 ) we urgently need a mechanism whereby proven professional competency in developmental physical activity based on a consensual body of knowledge is demonstrated as part of a licensing procedure prior to professional practice . <p> Agreeing ( 1 ) on a name , ( 2 ) devising a taxonomy for our subject matter , ( 3 ) providing for the steady development of an undergirding body of knowledge based on such a taxonomy , and ( 4 ) instituting a mechanism whereby practitioners are licensed after demonstrating theoretical knowledge and competency in practice would relatively soon place our field in a position where a professional practitioner would be recognized by society as a " such-and-such "  --  no matter what type of position that person held within the many our field offers , nor in which state or province such professional service is carried out . <p> First , reaching agreement about a name will still undoubtedly be " horrendously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Physical Education after decades of committee reports and accompanying discussions finally and somewhat reluctantly accepted the addition of the term " kinesiology " to its name . It is now officially The American Academy of Kinesiology and Physical Education . Of course , it 's anybody 's guess how many of the approximately 700 professional programs in the 50 states use the term " kinesiology " in their title . And , despite this move toward the name " kinesiology , " a recent survey by the author revealed that the most commonly appearing name around the world is still " physical education and sport " ( Zeigler , 1994 ) . <p> Discussions about a possible undergirding body of knowledge for the profession began early in the 1960s after Russia 's first Sputnik of the late 1950s . C.H. McCloy , State University of Iowa , possibly the leading physical educator/scientist of the first half of the 20th century , immediately called for an upgrading and broadening of our research effort . Shortly after , President Con-ant of Harvard , criticized the quality of graduate education in our field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and King McCristal ( Illinois ) to form the Big Ten Body-of-Knowledge Project ( Zeigler &; McCristal , 1967 ) . <p> Many scholars contributed to the quest for a disciplinary definition in the 1960s and periodically thereafter , a search that has continued down to the present . A substantive discussion on the topic occupied the entire issue of Quest in December of 1990 . In it Karl Newell , head of the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Illinois , Urbana-Champaign , presented a comprehensive treatment of many aspects of the topic . His series of articles was followed by reactions from five leading scholars and a final commentary by Newell . Space does not permit a detailed discussion of Newell 's arguments here . Interestingly , however , he concludes that the term " kinesiology " should be " the label for the study of physical activity in higher education " ( Newell , 1990 , 269278 ) . Spirduso ( 1990 ) agreed with Newell that " physical activity really is the common denominator of sport , exercise , ergonomics , biomechanics and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . However , she argued that the study of physical activity is not ( i.e. , could not be ) the exclusive domain of a specific discipline , because a cross-disciplinary approach is needed . ( The interested reader is urged to pursue this entire interesting issue of Quest . ) <p> Several questions come to mind immediately : ( 1 ) if physical activity  --  however defined !  --  is indeed what our field is or should be all about , why should we select a ( foreign ) name such as kinesiology when very few people in the field possess the competency to analyze human movement even kinematically , much less kinetically ? Secondly , if the large majority of our practitioners ca n't analyze movement in sport well , for example , how are we going to convince a presently unenthusiastic public that we know what we are talking about ? Lastly , to list just a few " immediate problems , " what conceivably will be the reaction of our colleagues in academe when they learn about our inadequacy  --  that " the king is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said above , it is now absolutely essential that we strive for agreement on a name that represents largely what physical education has stood for during the past 150 years . I have been as loyal as anyone to what AAHPERD decided to call " sport and physical education " in the United States and the still prevailing " physical and health education " in Canadian school curricula . We could call ourselves human motor performance , but this might not seem right to some nor sufficiently academic to others . Movement arts and science has possibilities . I agree that the term " kinesiology " has been in the dictionary for decades ( Slowikowski &; Newell , 1990 ) , and there certainly has been a recent strong effort afoot in both the United States and Canada for its acceptence . <p> Unfortunately , the term " human kinetics " appeared on the scene recently as well . However , kinetics is part of another discipline ( physics ) . Personally , I am in full agreement with Newell and Spirduso that our basic medium is indeed physical activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , I am now absolutely convinced that what we are basically involved with is " DEVELOPMENTAL physical activity "  --  that is , some sort of planned physical activity in sport , exercise , and related expressive movement "  --  and that 's it ! ( The term kinesiology , I believe , should revert to what it has always meant in our field of study , one subject-matter in the professional curriculum . ) The late Elizabeth Halsey recommended developmental physical activity as a name in the late 1950s , but the time was not yet ripe for its acceptance . Now  --  Eureka !  --  at least the University of Regina in Saskatchewan , Canada calls its unit the Faculty of Physical Activity Studies ! <p> It should be obvious , also , that the profession , along with various governmental agencies and the medical profession , is indeed promoting developmental physical activity for people of all ages . Further , we should be " professing " our theoretical and applied knowledge on behalf of normal , accelerated , and special populations in society . Thus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " womb to tomb " responsibility for the developmental physical activity of all citizens throughout their lives . <p> Additionally , I want to emphasize a now longstanding position that we are not typically qualified to be recreation directors , nor are we health specialists or dance specialists with undergraduate and graduate degrees in either of these three allied professions . These allied professions have become too highly specialized for us to think that there can be one professional association ( Alliance ! ) for all four fields . What we do understand is physical recreation only , some of the health aspects of developmental physical activity , and occasionally some of the social and traditional dances . <p> In the early 1980s , Laura J. Huelster ( the late Professor-Emerita from the University of Illinois , C-U ) and I deplored the rift that had seemingly inevitably developed in the field since the mid-1960s between the so-called scholars and the so-called practicing professionals . You know what I mean , between the people who are not ashamed to be called " physical educators " and those who are ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " human kineticists " seeking academic respectability in our universities by typically calling themselves " what they ai n't " ( i.e. , " phys. ed. " degrees holders with insufficient background experience to provide competency to analyze movement ) . <p> What could possibly be done about these myriad problems ? One approach would be to work for agreement on a taxonomy that would include both the professional and the scholarly dimensions of our work . With this thought uppermost in our minds , Huelster and I postulated a balanced approach between the subdisciplinary areas of our field and what might be identified as the subprofessional or concurrent professional components . By this we mean that what many have called scholarly professional writing ( e.g. , curriculum investigation , management theory ) will be regarded as scholarly endeavor if done well , just as what many have considered to be scholarly , scientific endeavor ( e.g. , exercise science ) if done well should be regarded as professional writing too ( i.e. , writing that should ultimately serve the profession ) . <p> As part of an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the field , we developed a taxonomical table to explain the proposed areas of scholarly study and research using our nomenclature ( sport and physical education terms only ) along with the accompanying disciplinary and professional aspects . We agreed upon eight areas of scholarly study and research that are correlated with their respective sub-disciplinary and subprofessional aspects in Table 1 below . Most importantly , you will note that the names selected for the eight areas do not include terms that are currently part of the names of , or the actual names , of other recognized disciplines and that are therefore usually identified with these other ( related ) disciplines primarily by our colleagues and the public ( Zeigler , 1994 , p. v ) . <p> Our position is that we must promote and develop our own discipline of developmental physical activity and our own profession of sport and physical education as described above , while at the same time working co-operatively with the related disciplines and the allied professions ( to the extent that interest is shown in our problems ) . We maintain that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise , etc. , it will just be a matter of time before these other disciplines and professions awaken to the importance of what we believe to be our professional task ( i.e. , the gathering and dissemination of knowledge about developmental physical activity through the media of sport , exercise , and related expressive movement , and the promotion of it to the extent that such promulgation is socially desirable ) . <p> Such " awakening " by our related disciplines is necessarily not a bad thing , of course . For example , it quite recently happened in the historical aspects of our field . " Sport history has been discovered , " was reported several years ago in the U.S. Chronicle of Higher Education . As a matter of fact , there were 54 physical education doctoral studies and hundreds of master 's theses on purely sport history as of 1969 , not to mention literally thousands of physical education these and dissertations with a historical orientation over the past 50 years ! Further , the North American Society for Sport History has held conferences and published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been excellent national and international sport history journals available for decades . <p> I 'm certain that you , the reader , can understand my concern ; it is simply this : the end result of a continuation of this splintering of our field of sport and physical education is bound to be a " mishmash " of isolated findings by well-intentioned , scholarly people not in a position to fully understand the larger goal toward which our profession is striving . Also  --  and this is vital for us  --  we will be destined ( doomed ? ) to perpetual trade status not professional status  --  as perennial jacks-of-all-trades , masters of none . <p> Members of AAHPERD , Phi Epsilon Kappa , and CAHPERD ( the latter in Canada ) could help greatly in this regard by exerting all possible influence in the direction being recommended . You have an influence on the hiring practices in the various states , provinces , and territories . I urge you to see to it that men and women who are hired have the knowledge , shills , and competencies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these knowledge and competencies needed to do the finest type of work as a physical educator/coach  --  and then demand that the universities and colleges prepare young people solidly along these lines . Then as a profession develop a licensing procedure that guarantees to the public that our licentiates know what they are doing as professional practitioners in developmental physical activity . <p> Finally  --  and most frankly  --  would n't we all be sad to see the field to which we have devoted our lives continue to lose ground ? We are being outflanked by so many different specialists that one hardly knows in what area we as a profession still speak authoritatively . It does n't have to be this way . If we do n't take positive steps to sharpen our image as we seek to rectify the present development and continuing trend , we will continue to lose " professional ground . " I believe we deserve a better fate , but we are going to have to plan and to " work like Hell " to earn it ! PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
