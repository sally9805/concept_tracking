Abstract <p> Epstein-Bart Virus ( EBV ) infection generally has a benign clinical course . Upper airway obstruction is a known complication requiring the otolaryngologist 's attention . EBV is usually associated with adolescence but has been increasingly documented in younger children . We review 36 pediatric admissions for infectious mono-nucleosis over a 12-year period at our institution , 11 of which required consultation for airway obstruction . Airway management was based on clinical severity and ranged from monitored observation , with or without nasopharyngeal stenting , to prolonged intubation or emergent tonsilloadenoidectomy . A rare case of a four-year-old with near total upper airway obstruction secondary to panpharyngeal and transglottic inflammatory edema prompted this review and is reported . The otolaryngologist must recognize the potential severity of EBV-related airway compromise and be prepared to manage it . Introduction <p> Infectious mononucleosis ( IM ) is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) and usually has a benign , self-limited clinical course . It presents as a constellation of findings , including fever , tonsillopharyngitis , cervical adenopathy , and hepatosplenomegaly . Other otolaryngologic signs and symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 2 , 3 EBV infections are generally associated with adolescents and young adults but have been increasingly reported in younger children. 2 , 3 Airway obstruction has been estimated to occur in 3.5% of patients with IM. 4 Despite being a well-recognized complication , however , the management of airway obstruction in children with acute IM has received scant attention in the recent otolaryngologic - head and neck surgery literature . <p> A 12-year retrospective analysis of 36 children discharged from the Medical College of Virginia ( MCV ) with a diagnosis of IM from 1982 - 1994 was performed . This review was prompted by our participation in the management of a four-year-old child with serologically confirmed acute IM resulting in severe pharyngeal , transglottic and tracheal edema requiring 21 days of intubation for airway support . We review the diagnostic criteria for these patients , evaluate the incidence and severity of airway obstruction , and describe the management algorithms employed . Materials and Methods <p> Forty-five patients ages 18 years or younger were discharged from MCV with a diagnosis of acute IM from January 1982 to December 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were evaluated for patient age , race , and gender , as well as initial symptoms , duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization , serologic diagnostic confirmation , and need for otolaryngology consultation with evaluation for and management of airway obstruction . Results <p> Case Report <p> A four-year-old black girl saw her local medical doctor with a four-day history of upper respiratory tract infectious symptoms and signs including malaise and fever . An EBV heterophile antibody test ( Monospot ) was negative and she was treated for bacterial pharyngitis . Increasing respiratory distress developed over the following 24 hours and she was hospitalized for observation . Progressive airway compromise ensued and she was intubated and transferred to the MCV pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) for further evaluation and care . <p> The patient arrived with a 4.0 mm uncuffed nasotracheal tube in place which was changed to a 4.5 mm uncuffed tube because of an excessive air leak . She was febrile to 38.9 degree centigrade . Her white blood cell count was 10,000 with 14% monocytes . She did not have any known food or drug allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving intravenous nafcillin sodium and penicillin-G potassium for 24 hours . <p> Her physical examination on MCV hospitalization day two revealed a markedly edematous and protuberant tongue , edematous oral mucosa and 3+ palatal tonsils without bacterial exudate or palpable abscess formation . Her uvula was swollen to twice its normal size and the posterior oropharynx was diffusely edematous , bilaterally . She did not exhibit facial edema . Flexible fiberoptic examination revealed circumferential pharyngeal edema extending from the superior nasopharynx into the supraglottis . Visualization of the glottis was obscured by soft tissue edema completely surrounding the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes . She exhibited significant bilateral anterior and posterior cervical adenopathy with moderate bilateral induration . No air leak was obtained around the endotracheal tube at up to 40 cm of water . <p> Computed tomography ( CT ) was obtained and revealed diffuse , bilateral soft tissue thickening extending from the superior nasopharynx to the cervical trachea . Transglottic soft tissue thickening completely surrounded the endotracheal tube with normal tracheal lumen identified around the distal end . There was markedly enlarged palatal and nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue and diffuse cervical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Figs. 1-4 ) <p> A monospot was repeated as part of an infectious mono-nucleosis serologic laboratory panel . Her serum was positive for the heterophile antibody as well as the EBV capsid antibody but negative for the EBV nuclear antibody . A diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis with panpharyngeal and transglottic edema was made . <p> Paralysis with sedation was maintained . Intravenous antibiotic coverage was discontinued . Her physical examination remained unchanged for two weeks at which time the question of prolonged intubation and possible need for tracheotomy was raised . In view of the soft tissue inflammation surrounding the proposed operative site , along with the serologically confirmed diagnosis and expected self-limiting course of her obstruction secondary to inflammatory edema , a recommendation for continued intubation with close surveillance was made . <p> On day 19 , her lingual edema began to show pitting and early signs of resolution . She entered a phase of rapid resolution over the next 24 hours . Intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate was administered ( 0.25 mg per kg q6 hours ) and she was extubated on day 21 . She steadily improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow-up evaluation has been performed up to twenty-four months post-discharge . Of note , she has received amoxicillin-clavulanate since discharge without adverse sequelae . She continues to demonstrate a clear voice , laminar air flow to cervical auscultation and a normal endolarynx to flexible fiberoptic examination . <p> Chart Review <p> Thirty-six charts were available for review and included 16 males and 20 females . Twenty patients were black , 15 were white and one patient was biracial . The median age was eleven years ( range 2 - 18 years ) . The median length of time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was six days ( range 1 - 21 days ) . The median duration of hospitalization was four days ( range 1 - 24 days ) . <p> The most common symptoms were malaise ( 86% ) , fever ( 83% ) , dehydration ( 69% ) , and sore throat ( 64% ) . The most common physical findings were palatal tonsil hypertrophy ( 61% ) graded 3+ or greater , and cervical lymphadenopathy ( 81% ) , of which 17% had anterior , 24% had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cervical adenopathy was reported but unspecified in 11% of patients . Other manifestations included hepatosplenomegaly ( 36% ) , elevated liver enzymes ( 33% ) and meningitis ( 3% ) . Additional head and neck findings included otitis media ( 6% ) , epistaxis ( 6% ) , and sinusitis ( 6% ) . Serologic confirmation of EBV infection was obtained in 32 patients ; the other four were diagnosed on the basis of their physical examination and findings on peripheral blood smear . <p> Fourteen otolaryngology consultations were obtained , eleven for airway evaluation , one for severe tonsillitis without airway compromise and two consultations were obtained for infectious sinusitis . Of the 11 patients requiring airway evaluation , eight had lateral neck x-rays obtained prior to otolaryngology consultation . All eight had " tonsil and adenoid enlargement " reported . <p> All 11 patients with airway evaluation had significant 3+ to 4+ palatal tonsil hypertrophy . In comparison , of the remaining 25 patients , 11 had " enlarged tonsils " reported and three had undergone previous tonsilloadenoidectomy ( T &A).; Four patients had flexible fiberoptic examinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Two patients had " unobstructed laryngeal airways " and one patient had 4+ adenoid hypertrophy . One patient underwent direct laryngoscopy in the operating room while intubated and under general anesthesia following emergency transfer from the radiology suite . <p> Of those patients evaluated for airway obstruction , two were managed with observation and intravenous hydration . All but two patients ( observation , emergent T &A); received intravenous steroids ( dexamethasone sodium phosphate , 0.25 mg per kg q 6 hours , or methylpredniso-lone sodium succinate , 1 mg per kg q 6 hours ) for one to three days . Four patients were observed with nasal trumpets at bedside with one patient subsequently requiring 24 hours of nasopharyngeal stenting two days later . Two patients underwent nasopharyngeal stenting for 8 and 24 hours following initial otolaryngology consultation . Two patients required PICU management , the case report and one patient who underwent an emergent T &A; with post-operative endotracheal intubation for twelve hours and a total of 24 hours PICU observation . Three patients ( observation , nasal trumpet X 2 ) were discharged on a three-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kg q day ) . The six most recent patients had bedside pulse oximetry monitoring until discharge . ( Table 1 ) Discussion <p> Infectious mononucleosis is estimated to occur in approximately 350 of every 100,000 adolescents. 1 It has recently been reported with increasing frequency in younger children. 2 , 3 It results from acute infection by the Epstein-Barr virus , a member of the Herpetoviridae family . This DNA virus is large but fragile and requires prolonged and direct contact with infected secretions for communicability. 1 , 10 <p> Clinical manifestations vary widely . The majority of children present with fever ( 95% ) , tonsillopharyngitis ( 70% ) , and cervical adenopathy ( 94% ) , primarily posterior triangle . Concomitant Streptococcal tonsillitis is reported to occur in 10 - 19% of patients. 2 Elevated liver enzyme levels are reported in approximately 90% of patients 3 and hepatosplenomegaly , particularly in young children ( 60% ) , is also common . Neurologic complications , including cranial and peripheral neuropathies , have been estimated to occur in 5-7% of all cases. 3 , 10 Fatality is , fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in 3.5% of all patients with acute IM , 3 and is usually secondary to a combination of Waldeyer 's ring hypertrophy and surrounding inflammatory edema. 2 In this series , 31% of inpatient admissions required airway consultation . This is similar to the 36% incidence previously reported. 2 Our analysis also supports the observation that airway obstruction is more common in , but not limited to , younger children. 2 In contrast to only 6 of the 27 older patients ( 22% ) , 5 of 9 children six years of age or younger ( 56% ) were symptomatic enough to require an airway consultation . ( Table 2 ) Serology <p> The " monospot " is a quick , inexpensive screening test based on the presence of serum heterophile antibodies . They are present in 70% of IM patients by the first week of illness but can be found in 95% of IM patients by the third week . These IgM antibodies may persist for months . Children less than four years of age have a relatively low rate of heterophile antibody production which may account for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confirmed with more specific and sensitive serological testing . Acutely , patients produce IgM and IgG antibodies directed against the EBV capsid anti-gen . IgM levels are transient , while IgG may be present for life . Antibodies to EBV nuclear antigens are not detectible until several weeks to months later. 5 Airway Management <p> In our review , 11 of 36 hospitalized patients ( 31% ) experienced " noisy breathing " , sternal retractions or nasal flaring significant enough to require an otolaryngology consultation ( Table 2 ) . Seven patients were initially evaluated in the pediatric emergency room , two patients were examined in their general pediatric room , one patient was evaluated in the PICU ( case report ) and one patient was first seen in the operating room ( emergent T &A).; Airway evaluation consisted of observation and a head and neck examination with direct inspection of the oral cavity and oropharyngeal airway . Flexible fiberoptic examination was performed on four patients and attempted but not tolerated in one child . A 2.0 mm flexible fiberoptic endoscope has facilitated identification of the site and degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms and signs referable to airway obstruction , we did not identify any additional distinguishing clinical characteristics of these 11 patients from the remaining 25 . <p> When airway obstruction was encountered it was usually secondary to palatal and nasopharyngeal tonsil hyper-trophy . Consistent with a previous report , conservative management was usually all that was required in these cases. 2 In our series , with the exception of the case report and emergent T &A,; all patients treated aggressively with nonsurgical management significantly responded within 12 to 36 hours of initiation of their treatment . In addition to monitored observation , humidification , head of bed elevation and systemic steroids , four patients had nasal trumpets placed at bedside with one patient requiring nasopharyngeal stenting two days later to relieve progressive airway obstruction . Two patients exhibited enough symptomatic local soft tissue obstruction to warrant nasopharyngeal stenting at the time of initial consultation . Signs and symptoms were relieved and all three were successfully decannulated within 24 hours . Patient compliance with this treatment may be a factor , however , as one patient did not tolerate the trumpet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continuous pulse oximetry on the pediatric floor has allowed all but the most severely obstructed patients to be safely managed outside of the intensive care unit . <p> Despite being a primary viral infection , it can be argued that systemic antibiotics have a role in the management of airway obstruction in acute IM . Almost one in five patients have concomitant bacterial infection and it has been recommended that those children with positive throat cultures be placed on appropriate coverage. 2 However , systemic antibiotics may be of benefit to more patients by reducing the contributory potential for regional inflammation secondary to oral cavity bacterial colonization . Most patients were already on an antibiotic prior to their admission and this retrospective analysis did not reveal any consistent pattern of continued in-hospital utilization . <p> Patients who do not improve with conservative therapy may have contributory obstruction secondary to progressive regional inflammation . This paper documents that edematous extension from the oropharynx into the laryngopharynx and cervical trachea can occur in acute IM despite aggressive medical management . Intensive care monitoring and endotracheal intubation should be considered in these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , this is the first reported case in the English language literature of such dramatic EBV-related soft tissue conductive airway obstruction . If endotracheally intubated , either for primary airway support or postoperative care , bedside laryngoscopy and serial monitoring of leak pressures 6 , in addition to standard extubation criteria , should be utilized . <p> One emergent T &A; was found in our review . This was performed on a seven-year-old child in 1983 initially evaluated by another department . He was endotracheally intubated for acute airway obstruction occurring in the radiology suite . He was transferred to the operating room where an otolaryngologist was consulted and 4+ palatal and nasopharyngeal tonsils were identified . Cold dissection and snare tonsillectomy with adenoid curettage were performed . Estimated blood loss was 250 ccs . The patient was extubated the following morning in the PICU . <p> Some authors have recommended emergent T &A; for primary management of acute obstructive IM 7 , 8 while others do not support this viewpoint. 2Objections to emergent T &A; include the risk of general anesthesia , the potential for systemic bacteremia and increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clotting from hepatic disease. 2 It is reasonable to argue that an emergent T &A; is most effective in relieving obstruction from primary lymphoid hyperplasia with the possible secondary benefit of helping to facilitate the resolution of pharyngeal edema . Nonetheless , acute IM is usually a benign , self-limiting disease and we feel the clinical data support consideration of conservative measures before surgery as first-line treatment . We do not rule out the possible utility of delayed T &A; which may prove beneficial in relieving discrete oropharyngeal obstruction that is refractory to at least 48 hours of aggressive medical management . <p> Tracheotomy for airway obstruction secondary to infectious mononucleosis has also been advocated in the past , 2 , 4 , 7 however , we recommended against it for our patient . The natural history of IM is for resolution within two to four weeks . While tracheotomy would have increased patient comfort and prevented potential intubation complications , its disadvantages included performing an operation in an inflamed trachea and exposing already compromised edematous tissue planes to the threat of bacterial superinfection , in addition to exposing the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this paralyzed and sedated patient was easily performed and utilized to assure that there was no breakdown in the oral cavity or pharyngeal and laryngeal soft tissues . She was extubated without adverse sequelae and at long-term interval evaluation there was no evidence of endolaryngeal injury . Conclusions <p> Pediatric airway compromise associated with acute infectious mononucleosis is a well-documented complication . Younger children , in general , appear to be more at risk . Otolaryngology consultation with a thorough head and neck examination to locate and assess the degree of obstruction should be obtained early . Airway management should be individualized and based on clinical severity . Observation with pulse oximetry , humidified air , systemic steroids , and temporary nasopharyngeal stenting to bypass lymphoid hyperplasia or obstructive soft tissue edema should suffice in most cases . Tonsilloadenoidectomy is generally not necessary and should be reserved for those children with severe nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal obstruction who fail to respond to medical management . The otolaryngologist must be aware that progressive obstruction secondary to inflammatory edema can extend beyond the oropharynx into the laryngotracheal soft tissues .
