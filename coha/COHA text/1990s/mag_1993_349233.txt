" You like to watch do n't you , " the ads for Sliver ask , breathlessly leaving out all the proper punctuation marks , thereby implying that other , more significant proprieties may have been violated in the movie itself . If we 're honest with ourselves , we have to answer , " Well . . . er . . . um . . . yes . " <P> For a movie screen is , among other things , a big lighted window . And we , watching in the dark , are , among other things , voyeurs , always hoping to see forbidden sights . Sliver 's vulgar lure is that we will be allowed to peep at Sharon Stone in various stages of undress , in a variety of compromising positions . Its somewhat more interesting premise is that she is a projection of our watching selves , a respectable Manhattan publishing-house editor named Carly Norris , who is herself drawn into voyeurism . In other words , we are invited to watch a watcher as she learns to like watching , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  on the consequences that accrue to her as a result . <P> Sliver might have made more of this aspect of Carly 's psychology , but it is fixated on the fact that when she moves out of a bad marriage and into the high-rise that gives the film its title , she is in a near-terminal state of horniness . This explains her implausible attraction to Zeke Hawkins ( William Baldwin ) , who is creepy at first glance and does not improve on longer acquaintance . <P> Zeke is the secret owner of the building and the secret sharer of his tenants ' lives , for he has wired every room in the place and keeps tabs on everyone via closed-circuit TV . This makes him a prime suspect in the wave of violent deaths that has lately plagued the premises . Once Carly discovers his state-of-the-art electronics , he somehow becomes more attractive to her . This is possibly because the only other prospect Joe Eszterhas ' script makes available to her is a mystery novelist ( Tom Berenger ) made understandably surly by impotence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is extremely difficult to care which of the two guys may be the resident psychopath , and neither the script nor Phillip Noyce 's direction creates a growing , compelling sense of menace around Stone 's character . In fact , she is presented more as an object for study than as an object of sympathy  --  that is to say , rather voyeuristically . It is , of course , possible to see this as artful irony , given the film 's theme , but it feels more like carelessness . Or exploitation . Or simple imitation . For like Eszterhas ' somewhat hotter , somewhat smarter Basic Instinct , or the more recent Indecent Proposal , what this movie really wants to gaze upon is high- toned decor , and like its predecessors it treats its female star mainly as part of the furnishings , something that might get scratched or worn down  --  rendered , shall we say , unusable . This is bad sexual politics . It is also bad , unsuspenseful moviemaking.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
