<p> As the rich Persian Gulf environment absorbs what may be the biggest oil spill in history , experts say the prognosis for cleanup is all but hopeless . <p> " There is no way to significantly clean up this mess , the technology just is n't there , " says Roger McManus , of the Center for Marine Conservation , a veteran of 1989 's Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . <p> Indeed , while a six-member U.S. team heads to Saudi Arabia to advise on cleanup , many experts say the damage has already been done . " It would be practically impossible to clean up a slick this size under ideal conditions and these are not ideal conditions to put it mildly , " Sara Chasis of the Natural Resources Defense Council said this weekend . <p> Iraqi forces apparently unleashed the massive spill by opening crude oil spigots at Kuwait 's off-shore loading sites . So far , about 250 million gallons of crude - with a market value of about $ 125 million - may have flowed into the gulf , creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast that threatens to clog water treatment plants , foul beaches and devastate fish and wildlife resources . <p> " This promises to be a disaster of unprecedented proportions , " says Peter Bahouth , director of Greenpeace USA . <p> Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams ' assessment of the Iraqi strategy was even more blunt : " This is clearly an act of environmental terrorism . " <p> Though an air strike by U.S. forces Saturday on two oil pipe manifolds was said to stem the flow , the slick - nearly twice the size of the previous record spill of 140 million gallons after the Ixtoc 1 oil well blowout in 1979 off the Mexican Coast , and 23 times larger than the Valdez spill - remains a formidable threat . <p> Contributing to the slick : a damaged tanker - possibly hit during military strikes - off Khafji along the Saudi Arabian coast . <p> Allied commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf said the oil began gushing Jan. 19 when Iraqi forces opened valves to Kuwait 's Sea Island tanker loading terminal . At about the same time , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five tankers - up to 125 million gallons . <p> Schwarzkopf also said a fire at Sea Island - started during an allied naval attack Friday - would continue to burn for 24 hours as the 13-mile pipeline from shore emptied of oil . Though he called the spill regrettable , he also said it would not alter the allied forces ' strategy against Iraq . <p> " Unfortunately , war 's not a clean business , everybody 's known that , " he said . <p> The slick , moving about 13 miles a day , already has covered Kuwait 's beaches and is nearing Saudi Arabia 's huge Jubail area , site of a major port and the world 's largest desalinization plant . Also threatened is the island nation of Bahrain , which is directly in the slick 's path . <p> Along the Saudi coast , crews scrambled Sunday to protect vital intake pipes at the desalination plant that provides most of the country 's drinking water . Oil-absorbing booms now surround the water intakes and oil skimming boats relentlessly attacked the gooey mess . Airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up the massive slick . <p> ARAMCO - Saudi Arabia 's state oil company - has chartered a Norwegian- owned anti-pollution ship to help mop up . Also helping : warm weather , which can evaporate the volatile crude oil . " There is no danger , absolutely , to the desalination plants , " said Saudi environmental official Abdulbar al- Gain . <p> But al-Gain and others are less optimistic about preventing damage to other gulf resources . " Marine life and fisheries have been endangered , " he says . " We anticipate an impact on fisheries ' production for many years to come . " <p> Wildlife at risk : sperm and humpback whales ; four endangered sea turtle species ; the mugger crocodile . Also threatened : valuable fisheries , including shrimp , anchovies and mackerel . <p> Other gulf nations braced for the environmental onslaught : <p> - In Bahrain , pollution experts predict the spill will reach the center of the gulf in about five days and kill birds , fish , dolphins , turtles and mangrove trees along the way . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states bordering Saudi Arabia , cleanup crews were on alert in case the slick reaches their shores . But some experts said there was little risk because the slick would likely follow currents off Iranian shores to the east where the water was deeper . <p> In Dubai , the Public Health Department declared a state of emergency , formed cleanup teams and readied equipment in the event oil washes up on its beaches . " Basically , it 's a problem that nobody 's got a solution for right now , " says Peter Whitebred , who runs a 38-ship salvage company in Dubai . <p> The nature of the gulf itself exacerbates the spill : It 's comparatively shallow and has limited circulation , so natural flushing - a big boost for the Valdez cleanup - wo n't help . <p> " The bad news is that the gulf flushes itself very slowly , meaning the oil will take a long time to disperse , " says William Moomaw of Tufts University 's Center for Environmental Management . <p> " Environmental damage , even though not catastrophic , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Hokail , ARAMCO vice president . <p> The U.S. environmental team , dispatched by President Bush , includes experts from the Coast Guard , Army Corps of Engineers , Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . <p> A spokesman for the team also was not optimistic that existing cleanup technology would help in the Persian Gulf . " It has complicated matters tremendously being in a war zone , " says Coast Guard Capt . Biff Holt . <p> While experts pondered the cleanup task , others were baffled by the Iraqi strategy because the spill was not expected to have a significant impact on military activities in the gulf . Bush 's weekend assessment : " It 's kind of sick . There 's no rationality to it . It looks desperate . It looks last-gasp . It does n't measure up to any military doctrine of any kind . " <p> Saudi environmental official al-Gain also condemned Iraq for the strategy , saying it " runs against the principles of our religion and should be judged in this context . ... Saddam Hussein is waging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many wondered whether Saddam and his Iraqi forces would simply find another way to pour oil into the fragile gulf - even though allied forces had apparently blocked the source of the current spill . <p> Cmdr. Mark Lawrence , intelligence officer aboard the USS Roosevelt in the gulf , worries the Iraqis can continue to pump oil into the gulf " pretty much indefinitely from what we have been told . There are a lot of oil terminals . " <p> Says Saudi petroleum adviser Abdulaziz bin Salman : " It is a problem we will live with for a long time . " Contributing : Judy Keen , Paul Hoversten
