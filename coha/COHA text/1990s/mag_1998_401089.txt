From hiking high mountains to cruising a big lake , Washington Scouts make the most of their backyard wilderness . // First Class Scout Joel Rogers quickly dug his hiking stick into snow on 6,063-foot-high Park Creek Pass , struggling for control on the saddle dividing Thunder Creek and Stehekin River valleys in Washington 's Cascade mountain range . If he slid too far on the high , slippery slope , 16-year-old Joel might not see his 17th birthday . Joel did n't worry . Adults kept careful watch as he practiced " glissading . " By sliding in a sitting position , the technique controls travel down fast , snowy slopes . It can be a lifesaver in an accidental slip . Joel was sliding on purpose , and casually cruised about 100 feet , down to where fellow Scouts waited in the shadows of towering rock walls called Mount Logan and Mount Buckner . Look at My Backyard ! The 15 Scouts and 7 adult leaders from Troop 59 , Oak Harbor , Wash. , were on the second day of a 50-miler last August through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jagged peaks of the North Cascades attract hikers and climbers from across the nation , but Scouts from Troop 59 get to enjoy them all year . Only 98 miles separate their Scout meeting hall and the trailhead at Diablo Lake . The National Park Service limits group size to 12 on wilderness trails ( see sidebar , opposite page ) , so the Scouts separated into two patrols . The patrols slept at different campsites and started their first day of hiking six hours apart . They did n't combine until reaching the last campsite , outside the wilderness area .

Their schedule that day called for hiking 12 miles , gaining 4,000 feet of elevation . Avalanche debris blocked the way , and snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the path were hidden beneath the snow , Scouts practiced their route-finding skills . They used map and compass and also made " educated guesses " about where they would put the trail if they were to build it . How Far Now ? Eagle Scout Michael Brabner , who celebrated his 15th birthday on the trail , enjoyed the challengethat is , until trouble hit . Just before reaching camp that night , Michael vomited . " I overexerted myself , " Michael explained , " and did n't drink enough fluids . " It was a serious reminder for all : High altitude and hard work dehydrate faster than you realize . Lesson learned , Michael made sure he drank several quarts of water each of the following days . Other Scouts did n't become sick , just tired . This triggered a question that rang out every hour or so : " How much farther ? " It did n't matter whether they had just started the day , or were close to the end , someone always answered : " Five more miles ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear ( see sidebar at right ) . Because they decided to carry dehydrated food , the Scouts needed only enough stoves to boil water . Each patrol carried two stoves . There was one item , however , they wished they had brought more of : water filters . Some Scouts drank as much as eight quarts of water in a day , which put a strain on the filtering crews . " We could have achieved the job a lot faster if we 'd had three filters ( per group ) rather than two , " Life Scout Matt Magorrian , 14 , said . I 'm Never Going Back ' Life Scout Brent Rivard , 14 , saw two deer in his camp one night . " I was brushing my teeth and the doe came really close to me , " he said . Scouts sighted deer almost every day . They also encountered a marmot , two black bears , several bald eagles ... and swarms of mosquitoes . The bugs were worst at McAlester Lake . " They 'll eat you alive , " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm never going back to McAlester Lake as long as I live . " Erik and the rest of his patrol left that campsite early in the morning . Nobody was interested in hanging around long enough to cook breakfast . They packed quickly and stuffed cold food into their mouths . The Bear Necessities The two black bears , which remained at a distance , did n't cause the Scouts any problems . Still , each patrol took precautions to avoid close encounters . They hung " smellables " - items such as food , toothpaste , even fuel cans-outside the reach of the animals . Good thing . Galen Stark , Wilderness District Ranger , later said that within two weeks a bear raided a backpack at a campsite the Scouts had passed . Fueling Up Some Scouts might not have complained if their food had been snatched . They quickly grew tired of the dehydrated food . Scout Brian Maslowsky , 14 , held a practical viewpoint . " Think of it as fuel , " he said . " If you do n't eat it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouts approved of their lunch surprise on the fourth day , though . Troop 59 had arranged with Explorer Post 274 to pack in supplies to a campsite along the trail . These supplies would carry the Scouts their final three days .

( Dry ice kept it from melting in Stehekin River Valley 's 100-degree temps . ) Afoot and Afloat After five days and 55 trail miles , the patrols nursed wounds and traded stories at Harlequin campground . Then it was four more miles into Stehekin , a resort town at the northern end of Lake Chelan . Troop 59 hiked into town with flags flying . For the trek 's last leg , they boarded a passenger ferry , The Lady of the Lake .

From Mountains to Lake to Home A crowd of troop family members cheered the Scouts ' arrival at Manson . A celebration at a nearby campground included steak , lasagna and corn on the cob . The Scouts spent their final night under the stars . They had survived mosquitoes , dehydrated meals and a few blisters . In all , they had hiked a total of 59 miles , crossed two mountain passes and gained-and dropped-9,500 feet of elevation . A question rang out in the dark : " How far back home to Oak Harbor ? " And in the dark someone answered-what else ? - " Five more miles ! " +  --  John B.
