Ken Oberman , 61 , a 32-year veteran of Wall Street , is on a roll . His Oppenheimer Global BioTech was the hottest fund in 1991 , soaring 121% , vs. an average of 74% for the 10 sector funds specializing in high-flying health-care and biotech stocks . His Oppenheimer Global , No. 9 in its own 56-fund category in 1991 , was No. 1 during the past three years with a 71% return , vs. 30% for the group . And get this : his Oppenheimer Gold &; Special Minerals , No. 9 of 36 similar funds for ' 91 , was first during the past five years , returning 84% , vs. the long-depressed group 's puny 7% average . While Global Bio-Tech is closed to new shareholders ( as explained on the left ) , small investors can bet on Oberman through his $1.2 billion Oppenheimer Global ( 5.75% load ; 800-525-7048 ) . Some 15% of the portfolio mirrors his biotech fund 's mainly U.S. holdings . The rest , says Oberman , is dominated by thriving European firms whose stock prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pet investment themes for 1992 . " Many of these stocks , " he explains , " are bargain-priced at around five times cash flow , compared with multiples averaging about 10 for their American competitors . " ( Three of the Eurostocks that he cites below trade over the counter in the U.S. as American Depositary Receipts . The others can be bought through any full-service U.S. broker . ) Here are Oberman 's six investment themes for making money in ' 92 : * BIOTECHNOLOGY . " This field has the same sort of profit potential for investors as solid-state electronics did 20 years ago , " says Oberman , an avid student of gene splicing since its birth in the mid- ' 70s . Yet even he could n't keep up with 1991 's feverish 156% rise in Paine Webber 's index of 103 biotech stocks . Leading the rout were obscure over-the-counter firms such as Immune Response ( which was up 1,265% ) , Ecogen ( up 608% ) and Synergen ( up 496% ) , all prominent among his holdings along with established OTC stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Oberman is particularly impressed with the sales potential of a new antibody called Centoxin from 13-year-old Centocor ( recently traded at $50 ) , which had 1991 revenues of $60 million . The drug combats an elusive  --  and often lethal  --  toxin that 's produced by bacterial infection and strikes as many as 400,000 Americans annually . The drug also promises to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy , which suppresses patients ' immune systems , thus raising the risk of infection . Following Centoxin 's approval by U.S. regulators , which Oberman says is imminent , he expects its sales to multiply rapidly and to reward patient shareholders handsomely . What about the flock of 39 fledgling biotech firms that went public last year ? Oberman recommends two : $6 million Isis ( OTC , $16 ) and $2 million Genta ( OTC , $15 ) . Both are pioneers in the brand-new  --  and possibly breakthrough  --  field of antisense medicines . Rather than treating symptoms of disease , these compounds act like molecular Velcro , sticking to targeted DNA or RNA to shutdown genes that underlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to predict when such products will be approved . But he notes that both firms have attracted backers with deep pockets : Ciba-Geigy and Rhone-Poulenc for Isis ; Procter &; Gamble for Genta. * HEALTH CARE . Oberman has long made big investments in this broad sector , which accounts for 20% of his global fund . Reason : the wealthier that nations grow , the more they spend on drugs and medical devices to thwart ailments such as heart disease that often drag on for decades . A current pick is $8 billion Swiss drugmaker Roche Holdings ( recently $1,877 a share ) , formerly Hoffmann-La Roche , the 60% owner of biotech giant Genentech . " Here 's a top-quality drug stock , now big in biotech , " he notes , " priced at less than nine times cash flow , vs. multiples of 12 to 15 for its U.S. rivals . " He 's also keen on two Swedish firms : $1.6 billion Astra ( $97 ) , whose hot antiulcer drug Losec is sold in the U.S. by Merck ; and $740 million Gambro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialysis equipment . * INFRASTRUCTURE . Rebuilding America 's worn-out highways , bridges and railroads , predicts Oberman , will cost $140 billion over the next five years . And the bill could be even higher in densely populated Europe and Japan . His top infrastructure stocks : Asea Brown Boveri ( ADR , $55 ) , a multinational engineering conglomerate based in Zurich that makes 22% of its $27 billion sales in the U.S. : and Canada 's $2.5 billion Bombardier ( $14 ) , a maker of railcars for mass transit . * ENVIRONMENT . Many pollution-control stocks , once touted as recession-proof , have been trashed by prolonged slumps at home and abroad . But Oberman figures the industry 's sales will rebound an impressive 25% a year during the rest of the ' 90s as customers confront mounting regulations and discover incentives to recycle . He favors Denmark 's $95 million Brodrene Hartman ( $375 ) , a specialist in containers made of recycled paper , and Germany 's Berzelius Umwelt Service ( $169 ) , a $45 million processor of blast furnace wastes . * COMMUNICATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fax machines and cable TV commonplace in the U.S. " What many investors overlook , " says Oberman , " is that other nations are now following our lead , " unleashing pent-up demand for the technology . He recommends that investors plug into France 's CanalPlus ( ADR , $38 ) , a $1.1 billion pay-TV service fast expanding in Germany and Spain ; and $991 million Rogers Communications ( $12 ) , Canada 's No. 1 cable-TV and cellular-phone operator . * 1UROPE . Never mind that the collapse of Communism has upstaged the post-1992 debut of a single Euromarket . Oberman continues to look for highly efficient companies that figure to make big profits from both freer trade in the West and newfound markets in the East . Besides Asea Brown Boveri ( see above ) , he likes two Dutch firms : $1.1 billion publisher Wolters Kluwer ( $37 ) and $470 million shipping magnate Pakhoed Holding ( $26 ) . BIOTECH OR BIOWRECK ? Last year 's eye-popping 121% return for Oppenheimer 's $202 million Global Bio-Tech Fund invites the question : Is the biotech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised by a sharp sell-off in the biotechs or the broad market , " says manager Ken Oberman , who closed his four-year-old fund to new investors last October and has 20% of its assets idling in cash . Still , he belives the fund could recover and handily beat the Dow for the year , thanks to his stocks ' strong lineup of new wonder drugs . His 1992 forecast : U.S. regulators will approve roughly 15 biotech products , triple 1991 's total . And he expects the sector 's annual sales growth , recently about 10% , to average at least 40% over the next 10 years . <p>
