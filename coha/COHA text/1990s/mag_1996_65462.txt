Do n't Look Back // Cigar is closing fast on the record held by Citation ( above ) for consecutive victories by a U.S. thoroughbred in the modern era , but other great racehorses have also run off brilliant streaks . Number 1 of all time is Cameraro , who won 56 in a row in Puerto Rico in the 1950s . A nose behind is Kincsem , the Hungarian race mare who retired undefeated after 54 races in the late 1800s . Here are the leading winning streaks of American thoroughbreds in the 20th century . // WINS // HORSE ( date of streak ) // 16 // Citation ( 1948 , 1950 ) // 15 // Buckpasser ( 1966-67 ) Colin ( 1907-08 ) // 14 // Man O ' War ( 1919-20 ) Cigar ( 1994-96 ) // 13 // Personal Ensign ( 1986-88 ) // 12 // Morvich ( 1921-22 ) Spectacular Bid ( 1978-79 ) // It must have happened sometime in the middle of the night because the blood had already caked and dried over the coil 's shoulder and down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a broken section of fence on the north end of Brookside Farm . Barber , the foreman of the place , reached in a panic for his walkie-talkie. // It was a few minutes past 7 a.m. on Oct. 11 , 1990 , some 20 miles west of Lexington in the Kentucky bluegrass country outside Versailles , and Mac Carr , the assistant farm manager , had nearly finished loading his gear in the Jeep Wagoneer and was rushing to leave on a hunting trip to Colorado . In fact , Carr had just slipped his Winchester rifle into the back of the truck when he heard Barber 's wail over the radio : " Oh , God ! The Hammer 's gon na die ! The Hammer 's ripped himself wide open ! Get up here . Now ! " // Carr jumped inside the Wagoneer and roared out the gate onto Route 60 , heading east . " At about 300 knots , " he said . // The Hammer was the nickname that the farmworkers had given the unnamed son of Palace Music out of the broodmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner , Seattle Slew . Carr thought of the weanling as " a little puppy dog . " but one worker who handled the babies would exclaim , " He 's crazy . He 'll step on your head ! " And thus he became known as the Hammer . // Little else distinguished him . Carr had always liked Palace Music , who had earned five of his seven victories on the turf , because he thumped into the breeding shed " like a tyrannosaurus , bawlin ' and squallin ' like he was gon na eat ya alive . " All that sound and fury signified almost nothing . Palace Music was crooked in front and sickle-hocked behind , and he tended to pass on these deformities to his offspring , who were born largely with the slows . Brookside 's owner , Allen E. Paulson , had paid $510,000 for Solar Slew as a 2-year-old , but she had struggled as a racehorse , and in the fall of ' 90 , when she was eight . Paulson sold her to an Argentine stud farm for a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached him in the field . There were coyotes around , but they had not caused this . Coyotes would have run him down and cut him off and chased him until he dropped , then killed him where he lay . No , a deer had done this . Carr had seen them up there , and nothing will stampede a herd of weanlings faster than a bounding deer . Carr could picture the colt crashing through the dark into the fence , snapping the top wooden plank , tearing the wire mesh from the pole and cutting his right shoulder so deeply that Carr could nearly put both his hands in the wound . The foot-long gash began at the point of the shoulder and ran right down his chest . // " A horrible hole , " says Ted Carr , Mac 's father and the Brookside manager . " He was probably in front by 10 when he hit that fence . " // " But he was walking sound , " says Mac . " And when I came up to him , he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ? ' A tough little bird , I tell ya . " // The son of a failing sire and a castoff mare , the Hammer was not worth much to begin with , and at the age of 176 days , standing bloodied in that field , he had no prospects as a racehorse . In the class of 110 other surviving foals born that spring to Paulson mares , the Hammer was at the bottom . He took about 30 stitches that morning , but within days the rapscallion had burst through the sutures , and grooms were treating the wound by spraying it with water from a garden hose . No telling what price you could have bought him for back then . " You could n't have got 50 cents for him , " Mac says . // Racing lore abounds with stories of horses rising from obscurity to make a run at history . From Armed to Canonero II to John Henry , they twine the braids of hope and romance through the harsher narratives of the sport . But no modern tale of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weanling who grew up to be Cigar . Has any blooded horse , from any period of racing history , risen so spectacularly from the moors of nowhere to enduring legend in the manner of this 1,100-pound bay with a splash of white down his forehead and the ticktock balance of a Swiss watch ? // In the last 16 months , since trainer Bill Mott turned him from an indifferent soldier on the grass to an undefeated warrior on the dirt . Cigar has won 14 straight races at eight tracks  --  from Massachusetts to Florida , from California to the shores of the Persian Gulf  --  a streak that leaves him two short of Citation 's record 16 straight wins that included the 1948 Triple Crown . Cigar 's unbeaten run has taken him through 16 ? miles of racing during which he has at no time been more than five lengths off the lead . Eleven of his victories have been in Grade I stakes , against the finest older horses in the world , and they have ranged in distance from a hell-bent flat mile to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but two with the insouciance that begins to demarcate the sparely grazed territory of the Great Ones . Not since Spectacular Bid left shedrow in 1980 has racing seen a performer who could match the quality or charisma of Cigar , the 1995 Horse of the Year . // The Hammer mined out to be a runner , to be sure  --  one with more heart and resources than even his most ardent admirers were entitled to imagine . And on March 27 , in the first running of the $4 million Dubai World Cup on the sprawling desert racecourse of Nad Al Sheba , in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai , Cigar earned the latest accolade in an already extraordinary career . Under the lights that bathed the winner 's ring at Nad Al Sheba , as a weary Cigar circled nearby and thousands of Arabs delivered a standing ovation , the crown prince of Dubai and the creator of the cup , His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum , swept across the circle in his flowing white robe and red-and-white headdress and reached out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mott , " said Sheikh Mohammed , whose 550 horses in training give him the world 's largest racing stable . " He is the greatest horse in the world . " // It was a moment for history . The cup was created to bring together by invitation the fastest horses on earth over a mile and a quarter , and 11 horses from five countries  --  the United States , Great Britain , Japan , Australia and United Arab Emirates  --  paraded to the post on the sand-and-dirt course . When it was over , for the first time in its lengthy annals , racing had an undisputed world champion . // It seemed especially fitting that Cigar , on the occasion of staking that claim , should deliver his greatest effort as a racehorse and the most desperate , dramatic performance of his life , one in which every ounce of him was tested through the final 200 yards . Off badly , with his back legs slipping out from under him . Cigar had struggled to get in the hunt but was never more than four lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long backside and around that sweeping turn for home . By midway of the bend , he had ranged up outside the two front-runners  --  the Australian horse Danewin and L'Carriere , another American entry  --  and in the final straight , with about 100 yards to go , Cigar began to edge away . // What then ensued was the hairiest , most stirring horse race in memory . Cigar was two in front and driving to the eighth pole when , suddenly , another U.S. horse , songwriter Burt Bacharach 's Soul of the Matter , came surging to his flanks on the outside , with Gary Stevens on his back doing the twist . In a trice , the Soul was at Cigar 's neck . Then his throat . Then their noses were bobbing together . " We were eyeball to eyeball , " Bailey says . Cigar had missed two crucial weeks of training in Florida a month before , when he had developed an abscess in his right front foot , and Mott knew that if the missed time were ever to haunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it would show , " Mott says . " On the money . " // Bailey went to a lefthanded whip . Then , as the wire loomed 50 yards ahead , Cigar seemed to lean hard into the hit a final time , reaching forward with all he had left to pull away . He won it by half a length . No American-bred horse  --  at least none with the stature of Cigar  --  had ever left home on so daring an adventure , one filled with all the perils of time change and travel , and of the exotic world of desert days and Arabian nights . It would be impossible to conceive of a more romantic ending to such a quest . And , by the way , the winner 's $2.4 million share of the purse also made Cigar the richest horse in history , raising his earnings to $7,669,015 and pushing him past Alysheba. // The purse was a mere footnote to the duel . " The son of a gun had to dig down , did n't he ? " asked Mott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've always wondered if he 'd have something left if another horse ran at him . This is a very special horse . " // No one is more responsible for the Cigar phenomenon than William Irving Mott , 42 , a veterinarian 's son who came of age on the banks of the Missouri River in Mo-bridge , South Dakota , where winter winds howl off the prairies at 80 below and whence he fled in 1972 , a displaced , frostbitten cowboy out of high school , to learn the craft of training . Wonderfully patient in his handling of horses , careful about where he spots them at the races and conservative in developing and campaigning his young stock , Mott clearly favors erring on the side of caution . " Bill 's the best waiter I know , " says Jim Bayes , Cigar 's farrier . " He can outwait ' em all . That 's why he is where he 's at . The whole game is patience . " Because he rarely overmatches a horse and almost never saddles one not fit enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkable source of light  --  a laser of consistency in an otherwise murky , inscrutable game . // " He wins with everything , " says Andy Serling , a professional horseplayer who has been tracking Mott for years in New York and Florida . " With fillies and colts . Turf horses and dirt horses . It does n't matter . You get the feeling that every horse he sends to the track , not just Cigar , is the first horse in his barn . They all look great . There are no forgotten horses with Mott , and he knows better than any trainer where they belong . He 's the best . " In addition to Cigar , Mott has trained two other major champions , Theatrical and Paradise Creek , and he is as much of a cinch as Cigar to make it to the Racing Hall of Fame . // When they are finally enshrined , Paulson will have done his part to put them there . The 73-year-old aviation tycoon  --  for whom the taking of risks has always been part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive an owner/breeder as Mott has been a deliberate and careful trainer . Different as they are in style and approach , they grew up fleeing the same cold terrain of the same American hinterland . Paulson , the son of a farmer who went bust in the trough of the Depression , was raised on the banks of the Mississippi River , outside Clinton , Iowa . His life in turmoil , his father broke and his mother ailing with tuberculosis , Paulson was working as a janitor in a Clinton hotel in 1939 when he won $33.33 at bingo , which he invested in a bus ticket to California . " Everything was easy after I survived my childhood , " he says . // He is the archetypal self-made man . In 1941 Paulson was working as an airplane mechanic for Howard Hughes , and following the end of World War II , with something of Hughes 's touch for making money , he was buying hundreds of surplus B-29 engines then disassembling them and selling the parts around the world . He also began to convert old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his biggest gamble ever in 1978 , when he pulled together $52 million  --  some of it his money , some of it others '  --  and bought the money-losing Grumman subsidiary that built corporate jets . Paulson thus began the Gulf-stream Aerospace Corp. , and in just five years , while turning it into the world 's largest maker of small private jets , he boosted sales tenfold to $1 billion a year and pretax profits to $100 million . " I turned it around , " he says quietly . // By the late 1980s , after selling the company to Chrysler for $637 million in ' 85 , Paulson had invested more than $100 million in horses and land on which to raise them . Brookside had become a foaling factory , and Solar Slew was just one of hundreds of highborn mares who paraded through the breeding shed . While carrying her son of Palace Music , the mare was vanned in February 1990 to Country Life Farm , 30 miles north of Baltimore , where she was to be bred again that spring to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April 18 , and there they stayed , in this storybook nursery timbered with giant maples and oaks , until she could be bred again 30 days later . // The mare and her foal returned to Kentucky in July , but not before the flaxen-tailed rascal had left his mark . Farm owner Josh Pons 's wife , Ellen , five months pregnant , was walking Solar Slew and her son from one field to another one day when the colt suddenly cow-kicked her in the stomach and knocked her down . When Joseph Pons III was born four months later with a single dimple on his cheek , no one thought much of it , but the origins of the mark have since become a part of family lore . Five months after that , back in Kentucky , the colt nearly killed himself smashing through that fence , and a year after that , scarred but sound , he was galloping around the fields with Mac Carr on his back . // " He was a pretty thing , " Carr recalls . " A big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was just another horse , another son of Palace Music . I remember thinking before he went to the track , I 'd like to have this horse when he comes back home . He 'd make a real good lead pony. " // Over the next three years  --  until that fateful fall day in ' 94 when Mott finally switched him from the grass to the dirt  --  the only long-term future he had was as a pony . Alex Hassinger took over his training at Santa Anita when he was a baby , but he never raced as a 2-year-old . " A big gawky horse with structure but no mass , " Hassinger says . The catchiest thing about him was the fineness of his head and the curious white marking on his forehead . It looked like a little aerial photo of two white sandy islands . That and his name , which he did n't have until he was a year old . Paulson names many of his horses after aviation checkpoints around the world , and Cigar is somewhere in the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colt won his first race on the dirt as a 3-year-old  --  in his second start , at Hollywood Park , on May 9 , 1993  --  but Hassinger wheeled him back on the turf , where his Palace Music pedigree insisted he belonged , and he staggered home fourth after leading deep into the stretch . So there was never any thought of entering him in the Triple Crown races , a series run exclusively on the dirt . The colt raced with laudable consistency on grass that year , placing in two minor stakes and failing only twice in nine starts to earn a check , but he chipped a knee in his final start as a 3-year-old , in the Hollywood Derby on Nov. 20 , and soon after underwent surgery . Mott took him over in January , and for the next six months he did what he does best : He fussed with Cigar , waited for him to come around , fiddled with him and waited some more . The colt was found to have stress-induced ulcers , and Mott had him treated for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedigree be damned , nothing could cure the colt of his coldness toward the grass . Mott started him four times on the sod as a 4-year-old , and each time the colt grew closer to being Mac Carr 's lead pony . " Every race was worse and worse , " Mott says . Finally , out of exasperation he dropped Cigar into a main track mile at Aqueduct on Oct. 28 , 1994 . Voil ! He won by eight , under a stunned Mike Smith , who rode on cruise control . " A remarkable turnaround , " says Mott . // Thus began , on that autumn afternoon in Queens , N.Y. , the most extraordinary transformation of a racehorse ( from the highly suspect to the truly sublime ) in the recent annals of the turf . Jerry Bailey had ridden Cigar six weeks before that victory , when he got beaten by nearly nine lengths at Belmont Park , but Bailey had left early that October day at Aqueduct and had not seen him run . That night , at the Meadowlands , Smith asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe the race he ran today . He was off the screen . " // Mott swung Cigar back in the Grade I New York Racing Association Mile on Nov. 26 , but Smith was committed to ride another horse , Devil His Due , so he lost the mount to Bailey . Mott was in Fuchu , Japan , that day , waiting to run Paradise Creek in the Japan Cup , and that night he called the racing secretary 's office in New York to see how Cigar had done . " Won by seven , " a voice told him . // Mott was shocked . " You 're kidding ! " he blurted. // It was about this time , down at Country Life Farm , that Mary Jo Pons figured out the origin of her grandson 's dimple . " That 's where Cigar kicked him , " she told her daughter-in-law . // Back when Cigar was a baby , Paulson gave him to his wife , Madeleine , but he does not remember why . " Lots of times she leans on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . Now he inquired , alas , whether he could have Cigar back . " I 'll trade you , " she said . " Cigar for Eliza . " // Paulson winced . Eliza was his champion 2-year-old filly of 1992 , now a valuable broodmare prospect . " I sort of had second thoughts , " Paulson says . No matter ; he made the swap anyway . The man had spent a king 's ransom seeking to buy or breed that one surpassing horse , and he suspected now that he might have found him in Cigar . In fact , Paulson repurchased Cigar 's mother from Argentina shortly after the 1995 New Year for $150,000. // Mott , meanwhile , wasted no time cranking up Cigar in Florida . In his first race as a 5-year-old , he whipped a field of allowance horses at Gulfstream Park on Jan. 22 , 1995 , winning by two , and 20 days later he came back to face Holy Bull , the 1994 Horse of the Year , in the Donn Handicap . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bull and Bailey on Cigar , when Bailey heard Smith cry out , " Oh , no , Jerry ! " // Bailey glanced right , in time to see Smith standing in the saddle . The gray was pulling up lame ( he would be retired after the race with strained ligaments in his left front ankle ) . Cigar swept on to win by nearly six lengths . The rest of the year belonged to him as well . In the Gulfstream Park Handicap , his first try at 10 furlongs , he was parked six wide but laughed home , winning by 7 . Six weeks later , in the Oaklawn Handicap at Hot Springs , he pulverized perhaps the strongest bunch of horses to compete all year . And this despite Dale Cordova , the rider of second-place Silver Goblin , accidentally striking Cigar in the face as he ranged to Cordova 's right at the top of the stretch . " He just shook his head and got mad , " Bailey says . He scored by 2 . Cigar closed his spring campaign with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2 and the Massachusetts Handicap by four  --  and here Mott decided to call for a breather . // Paulson did not want to stop now , and he urged Mott repeatedly to fly the horse to California for the Hollywood Gold Cup on July 2 . Mott resisted . Seductively , the track raised the purse from $750,000 to $1 million . Mott shook his head . " Mr. Paulson called me every day , " he says . // " How 's the horse doing ? " Paulson would ask . // " He 's doing fine , " Mott kepi saying . // " Then bring him out here ! " the owner said . // All of Mott 's most conservative instincts told him not to go , and he conjured up every argument to make his case  --  that the horse needed time , that they needed to point him for the Breeders ' Cup Classic in the fall , that horses often do not do well shipping east to west in the pits of summer . At one point Mott told Paulson that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight in a row , and that he got her beaten by shipping her to California for a race . " She got beat by 29 lengths , " Mott told him . // " We 're not talking about Heatherten here , " Paulson told him . " We 're talking about Cigar ! " // Paulson kept the pressure on , of course , finally breaking Mott down by reminding him of a favorite business adage : " The risk is measured by the size of the reward . No risk , no reward . " // So it was here that Mott gave in . Cigar was simply indomitable at 10 furlongs that day . On the first turn a flying clot of dirt struck him on the head . He shook it off , grabbed the bit and sailed for the lead . Going down the backside , Cigar was pulling so hard that Bailey was standing nearly straight . " Like I was waterskiing on him , " Bailey says . " Then I just could n't hold him anymore . He was pulling so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him loose . I twirled my stick , and I did n't think I had it in my hand . It was numb . " // Cigar won as he pleased , by 3 lengths . As he hit the wire , Mott threw his arms around Paulson and yelled , " Thank you ! Thank you ! " // The Hollywood Gold Cup was , along with the Oaklawn Handicap , Cigar 's greatest performance of the year . It was also the most grueling of his races , leaving him with an inflamed ankle and no interest in doing much of anything , but Mott gave him the time he needed and brought him back . Of course , Paulson called each day to check on Cigar 's condition  --  ever on the muscle , the man wanted Cigar to run in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 13  --  but the horse had problems now , and there was no way Mott would force him back until he could withstand the pressure . By the time he returned , in the Woodward Stakes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 weeks and was into the bit again . The break was just the seltzer that he needed . He went on to win three straight at Belmont Park , the Woodward , the Jockey Club Gold Cup and the Breeders ' Cup Classic , and they crowned a rarity for the highest levels of any sport : a perfect year . // Of course , 1995 represents Mott 's signature year as a horse trainer  --  the season in which he brought the finest racehorse in America through an unflawed campaign waged over 10 months at six tracks . He and Paulson decided not to go through that again in 1996 . " We 've already proven what he can do here , " Mott said last winter . " We are looking for new challenges . " // They found more than they had bargained for . Cigar launched his ' 96 campaign in the Donn , winning easily by two , and he was heading for the Santa Anita Handicap in California on March 2 when Mott found the horse one morning standing in his stall and pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of his right foot . Ultimately , Mott pulled off the shoe himself and lanced the abscess with a farrier 's paring knife . The horse never left the shed for nearly two weeks , and the injury forced them to pass on Santa Anita . Mott had all he could do to get him ready for the cup , and that he chose to make the Dubai trip at all was a measure of his and Paulson 's confidence in the horse . " If any horse can do it , Cigar can , " Paulson said . " Dubai , here we come ! " // The horse left Miami on March 16 , shortly after blazing through a seven-furlong workout in 1:233/5 at Gulfstream , but he had problems acclimating to the desert , 7,000 jet-lagging miles from home . He was off his feed and not moving comfortably on the deep , tiring track at Nad Al Sheba . But Cigar gradually came around after Mott arrived on March 22 , and by the morning of the race , he was trying to run off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ! " Mott crowed . // And just in time . Exactly 12 hours later , in front of a roaring crowd of more than 20,000 souls , in a part of the world that is the ancestral home of all thoroughbreds , there was this sleek and gritty bay making one last charge for the wire and defining for us all the very highest standard of the breed . Cigar was bearing history as well as Bailey on his back that night . He was , indubitably , the Horse of the World . // This article contains a table .
