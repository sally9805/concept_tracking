<p> A PLEA FOR CALWORKS WELFARE REFORM PLAN <p> Editor  --  Last week , we witnessed the governor 's swift veto of the welfare reform plan , called CalWORKS . This plan was in line with the requirements of the federal welfare legislation , and had designed a framework that could truly move people from welfare dependency to real work  --  work that would pay a living wage and lift people out of poverty . <p> As a large social service agency in San Francisco , we have begun to see increased need for the most basic of services from those who lost their safety net when the first series of SSI cuts were made in January . Many of these people have been coming to St. Anthony Dining Room for a meal each day , but were able to maintain a roof over their heads . Now , with their SSI support removed , they are being pushed into deeper poverty and are in danger of becoming homeless . <p> CalWORKS provides for the child care , job training and education that would effectively move people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provides reasonable time frames for people to find work . The plan is practical and compassionate . <p> With the governor 's veto the decision rests in the hands of the " Big 5 , " but we call on the whole community to encourage our legislators to stand firm on the CalWORKS plan as it is and accept no more concessions . It would be better to take no action this year than to adopt the changes that the governor is calling for . <p> The decisions being made in the next few days are too important to be caught in the partisan battle that now surrounds the debate . Too many real people  --  mothers , fathers , children and grandparents  --  will be hurt if we accept further concessions . <p> May our ears and hearts be open to respond out of compassion and justice . <p> Fr .

This translates into an astounding 173 hours ( 4.3 work weeks ) per year excess commute time on BART compared to Caltrain ; 2 ) If the Millbrae Station is built , the BART EIR reports indicate that traffic flow on Highway 101 south of the airport from Millbrae Avenue to at least Third Avenue in San Mateo will significantly worsen the service to level " F , " the worst category ( gridlock ) directly attributable to BART . According to the EIR , the impact will be " significant and unavoidable " with " no feasible mitigation measure . " <p> Thus , rather than alleviating highway congestion , to the contrary , BART , and in particular the proposed Millbrae Station , will significantly increase traffic congestion on Highway 101 throughout most of San Mateo County . This massive traffic congestion will impact on the tens of thousands of commuters from San Mateo and Santa Clara counties who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same BART EIR noted that the TSM Alternative ( II ) involving Caltrain would have actually reduced traffic on Highway 101 and was the only alternative to do so , despite costing only a fraction of the BART project . It is unfortunate that so few people are aware of these facts and many elected officials have ignored them despite being clearly summarized in the BART analyses . <p> RICHARD S. SCHWARTZ <p> Burlingame <p> . <p> WHY THE SURPRISE ? <p> Editor  --  If we put our elections up for sale to campaign funders , why are we so surprised that the Chinese , who are at least as good businesspeople as anyone else , want to buy in ? <p> ERNEST CALLENBACH <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> EVERYONE DOES IT <p> Editor  --  Clinton and Gore say they did n't do anything wrong and they wo n't do it any more . <p> Democrats say they did n't do anything wrong and everyone does it . <p> So if they wo n't do it any more and everyone does it anyway , why do we need campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> THANKS FROM MAYOR DALEY <p> Editor  --  As president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors during the 65th annual meeting in San Francisco , let me extend my warmest thanks and appreciation to Mayor Willie Brown , protocol director Charlotte Mailliard Swig , the city 's workforce  --  police , fire and all others , the hundreds of wonderful volunteers , and the sponsoring corporations  --  for the outstanding job done in hosting our meeting in one of America 's greatest cities . <p> As mayor of Chicago , another great American city , I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to celebrate San Francisco 's vitality , civic pride , cultural life , ethnic diversity , charm and friendliness . From our morning walks hosted by Mayor Brown around your beautiful city , to the delightful events at your cultural and civic centers , our serious sessions with the president , vice president and other federal officials , our visit to San Francisco has reinforced my confidence in the bright future of America 's cities . <p> Thanks again to all the people of San Francisco for your wonderful hospitality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SECOND THOUGHTS <p> Editor  --  Last Tuesday , as I was walking across Market Street at New Montgomery Street , a red- light running bicyclist slammed into me with quite an impact . His only response was laughter ; no apology ; no concern about any injury that he may have caused me . His only thought was to leave the scene as quickly as possible . <p> I am a strong supporter of alternative , environmentally sound forms of transportation like cycling . I have been advocate of creating more bike-friendly streets , bike lanes across the bridges and bicycle parking . I also have been a strong proponent of Critical Mass . <p> Individuals like the one who ran into me this morning make supporters like me into opponents . <p> KAREN HACK <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> DO N'T BLAME THE DOGS <p> Editor  --  Re the controversy over the banning of off-leash dogs at Ocean Beach , there is not one shred of evidence to show that off-leash dogs have anything to do with the decline of the Snowy Plover . The GGNRA 's own study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ocean Beach , the Snowy Plover population doubled . <p> The National Park Service 's Ocean Beach ban is only one part of a many-pronged attack on off- leash dog walking in the traditionally off-leash dog walking areas of the GGNRA . <p> The random banning of harmless recreational activities will not protect the Snowy Plover . <p> CHRISTIE HOCHSCHILD <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A LETTER MISREAD <p> Editor  --  I 'm sure The Chronicle does n't want to encourage extended letter skirmishes , but Robert E. Schofield Jr . ( Letters , July 17 ) has managed , almost completely , to misread my recent letter on a George Will column . To be brief  --  without making a list of all the things he says I said that I did not say  --  I did not " bash " China , with or without " fervor . " The only reason I mentioned China at all was because China and capitalism were the topics of Will 's column . <p> What I did criticize was George Will 's ode to unfettered capitalism as the vehicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on seeking the satisfaction of their multiplying appetites . " I still think that 's a poor philosophy of life , one likely to lead , as it does increasingly in this country , to the few getting richer at the expense of the many . <p> JACK PAGE <p> Oakland <p> . <p> THOUGHT FOR THE YEAR <p> Editor  --  My annual philosophical thought came to me the other day : Going though life is a lot like parallel parking . Rarely is either one or the other perfect . <p> The 1998 thought should arrive mid-year . Watch for it . <p> D. MACKENZIE <p> Los Altos Hills
