<p> Three Stars <p> BJORK <p> Homogenic Elektra , $ 16.98 <p> . <p> It would appear that stardom has taken its toll on the Icelandic pop singer Bjork . Until recently regarded as the burbling clown princess of Scandinavian musical exports , on her third album the gifted vocalist delves deeper into the mechanized laments and torch songs that have increasingly defined her solo career . The cumulative effect of these 10 songs is depressing  --  sometimes exquisitely , intentionally so , sometimes not . <p> Formerly the delirious vocal acrobat of the short-lived Sugarcubes , Bjork the solo artist has established herself as an ambassador for experimental hip-hop , tapping her darker impulses along the way . On " Homogenic , " she allows only occasional glimpses into the sunny , daisy-chasing personality that gave the Sugarcubes ' fractured pop its intermittent glitter . <p> On " Alarm Call , " one of the few songs on the new record that might be called upbeat , Bjork goes searching for her suppressed utopianism . " I want to go on a mountaintop , " she sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a radio and good batteries/ Play a joyous tune/ And free the human race from suffering . " And in the impressionistic , Japanese tea garden setting of " All Is Full of Love , " she soothes a downhearted listener , most likely herself : " You 'll be given love , " though " maybe not from the sources/ You 've poured yours into . " <p> With Bjork producing herself for the first time for an entire album , " Homogenic " is much more clear in purpose , and murky in execution , than its slicker , stylistically schizophrenic predecessor , " Post . " <p> The singer seems determined to capitalize on her developing role as pop 's most idiosyncratic interpreter of jazzy melody  --  represented on " Post " by " It 's Oh So Quiet , " currently the title-card track for the film " She 's So Lovely . " In that vein , the new album 's best song is " Bachelorette , " a doom-laden heartbreaker with an ominous film-noir quality intensified by the Icelandic String Octet , the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released " Telegram , " a collection of radical remixes of " Post " tracks . On " Homogenic , " she 's taken that experimentalism even further . Strange musical bedfellows bump up against one another at every turn  --  the fleeting classical string arrangements and trancelike , percussive distortion of " 5 Years , " for example . <p> In headlong pursuit of the oblique and the challenging , Bjork takes a potential tearjerker like " Unravel " and refuses to cry . One of many wrenching " ballads " on " Homogenic , " " Unravel " features Bjork in a duet with herself . There 's something disturbingly chilly about Bjork 's production here , from her gloomy-dockside atmospherics to the somber organ tones at the song 's fade . <p> Though she always keeps one ear tuned to movie soundtrack conventions , in some ways Bjork embodies the willfully eccentric vocal musician that Yoko Ono could never sell to the public . Her status as a recognizable personality makes her too close to pop for electronic music 's devoted underground , yet her adventurousness keeps her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the dark introspection of " Homogenic , " she 's likely to find no clear-cut path between the two camps . And that 's probably just the way Bjork wants it . <p> * James Sullivan <p> NEW TAKES ON STANDARDS FROM WILSON , TERRASSON <p> . <p> Four Stars <p> CASSANDRA WILSON AND JACKY TERRASSON <p> Rendezvous <p> Blue Note , $ 15.98 <p> . <p> No female jazz singer since Sarah Vaughan has Cassandra Wilson 's deep , darkly sensuous sound . She 's at her moody best on this appealing date with Jacky Terrasson , a gifted young pianist who finds fresh ways into familiar songs . Joined by bassist Lonnie Plaxico and percussionist Mino Cinelu , Wilson and Terrasson have cooked up a collection of standards that sound anything but standard . <p> An inventive accompanist and soloist who 's backed Betty Carter and other singers , Terrasson wrote all the arrangements , toying with the harmonies , tempos and rhythms of classics like " Tea for Two " and " It Might as Well Be Spring . " <p> The disc opens with a luxuriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's husky sound floats over rich piano chords in an open arrangement colored with shimmering percussion . Wilson swings through " I Remember You " with clipped notes and stretched phrases , and sings a soulful " Tennessee Waltz " to Terrasson 's churchy Ray Charles chords and licks on the Wurlitzer electric piano . <p> Terrasson also plays electric keyboard on Herbie Hancock 's " Chan 's Song , " which dances in a New Orleans-Latin groove , and a mysterious solo version of " Autumn Leaves " that begins with spooky synthesizer textures . <p> Wilson sings two exquisitely drawn-out ballads that suggest the influence of Shirley Horn and Miles Davis : a delicate reading of " Little Boy Lost , " sung with a whispered intimacy , and " If Ever I Should Leave You , " which floats and hovers and makes you lean forward to listen . <p> * Jesse Hamlin <p> STEREOLAB LOSES ITS EDGE IN SHAPELESS MELODIES <p> . <p> Two Stars <p> STEREOLAB <p> Dots and Loops <p> Elektra , $ 16.98 <p> . <p> Another example of a band so obsessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stereolab collaborated with contemporary visual artist Charles Long for its third major-label release , due out Tuesday . Although the popular designer had to bail out in the middle of the project , the influence of his gaudy , shapeless environmental sculptures lingers throughout " Dots and Loops "  --  which means Stereolab has toned down its edgy rhythms and prickly cocktail vibes to accommodate more amorphous song structures . <p> Where the band bridged smart retro kitsch with jerky dance rhythms and indie rock insurrection on last year 's " Emperor Tomato Ketchup , " the new album dwells primarily on breezy melodies that are pleasing but pointless . <p> It 's not that " Dots and Loops " is a disappointment , but rather that it rarely lives up to Stereolab 's adventurous precedents . The songs , much like Long 's art , are vivid but soft around the edges . They not only blend into each other but more often become lost in the overall picture . <p> * Aidin Vaziri <p> RUNDGREN RETREADS ARE GIVEN A LIVELY ' TWIST ' <p> . <p> Three Stars <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> Asked to rerecord a number of his " greatest hits , " Todd Rundgren made it a condition that he be allowed to revive his " personal standards " in bossa nova arrangements . <p> A camp joke ? " I 'm always serious , " Rundgren says , and the results on " With a Twist " bear him out . Cocktail-lite they may be , but the versions of " I Saw the Light , " " Hello It 's Me , " " A Dream Goes On Forever " and others only emphasize what wondrous songs they are . Using a four-piece band that includes ex-Utopia bassist Kasim Sulton and ex- Tubes drummer Prairie Prince , Rundgren applies the Astrud Gilberto treatment to his back pages in a way that 's never less than intriguing . <p> The standout tracks on " With a Tiwst " are the lesser-known songs , in particular " Influenza " ( from " The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect " ) , " Love Is the Answer " ( from " Oops ! Wrong Planet " ) and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . On these revivals , the softly shuffling grooves , one-step- ahead-of-the-beat phrasing and layered backing vocals inject new life into compositions that have been woefully overlooked . Equally lovely is the version of Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You , " never previously recorded by Rundgren . <p> Will " With a Twist " make any difference to Rundgren 's diminished commercial presence in the pop world ? Probably not . But seekers of musical nirvana should line up the pina coladas , get past their preconceptions of the man as a marginalized cult figure and avail themselves of the riches in this album . <p> * Barney Hoskyns <p> . <p> POP CDs IN BRIEF <p> . <p> Four Stars : THE SUNDAYS , Static and Silence , Geffen $ 16.98 <p> . <p> After a five-year hiatus during which they had their first child , Harriet Wheeler and David Gavurin have returned with the third Sundays album . " Static and Silence " is a celebratory effort with tight , folky pop tunes given wing by Wheeler 's satiny voice and Gavurin 's versatile guitar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rambling " Homeward " and the Brit-rock nostalgia of " Another Flavour " attest to the Sundays ' many facets . Occasional symphonic sweep heightens the record , but the band 's at its best in bare ballads like " Monochrome , " where Wheeler 's lyrics and delivery are pure poetry . <p> * Beth Winegarner <p> Three Stars : BRIAN McKNIGHT , Anytime , Mercury Records $ 15.98 <p> . <p> With the release of his fourth disc this Tuesday , Brian McKnight manages to embrace nearly every genre of popular black music from the Sean " Puffy " Combs-produced " You Should Be Mine " to the lavish orchestration of the spiritually inspired " When the Chariot Comes . " In doing so , he demonstrates that one can be up-to-the-minute without compromising . <p> * Gwendlynn Meno <p> Three Stars : MORPHINE , B-Sides and Otherwise , Rykodisc , $ 15.98 <p> . <p> After three albums and a handful of EPs and singles , it 's compilation time for Morphine  --  a two-string bass , snare drum , vocals and sax that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-bodied , exhilaratingly sinister sound , a baneful blues for bottom-feeders . Since Morphine does n't have any hits , it has collected live tracks , B sides , a tune from the recent Rykodisc tribute to Jack Kerouac , some concert favorites and seven new or rare tracks . The band sounds even more outside on several ambient free-verse pieces such as " Love 's Tributaries , " " My Brain " and " Mail . " But most of this is pure Morphine , the kind of thick , dark music played in the Loser 's Lounge at the Heartbreak Hotel . <p> * j. poet <p> Three Stars : SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS , Plastic Seat Sweat , DGC , $ 16.98 <p> . <p> Plenty of bowling-shirt bands have celebrated the " white trash " lifestyle in recent years , but few can match the gleeful gusto of North Carolina 's Southern Culture on the Skids . Nearly alone among such groups on major labels , these two men and a woman pack their second post-indie record with references to road kill , muscle cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing particularly new in the band 's sound , but it 's all good fun  --  barroom boogie , swamp rock , guitar-heavy go-gos . Music to barbecue by , or the soundtrack to your next trip to the dump . <p> * James Sullivan <p> CD RATING GUIDE <p> Five Stars  --  Classic <p> Four Stars  --  Excellent <p> Three Stars  --  Good <p> Two Stars  --  Average <p> One Star  --  Below Average
