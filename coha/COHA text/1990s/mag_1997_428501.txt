Section : News Of The Week Sports At 26 , Picabo Street , America 's best woman skier , thinks she 's already lived many lives . But in this one , can she come back from a wretched injury for one more triumph ? <p> ALTHOUGH PICABO ( yes , it 's pronounced Peeka-boo ) Street has a name out of Disney that sounds like a red-light district , she is not herself confident that the spoken word is sufficiently expressive . Whenever she speaks , just as a regular human being would , she also feels an obligation to act out whatever it is she is speaking about . This has to do with energy . <p> So , imagine Picabo now , discoursing in the living room of her home in Portland , Ore. , while simultaneously doing exercises and charades , thrashing about on the living-room rug in the company of her 3-year-old Australian cattle dog named Dugan . Her body  --  " tree-trunky " in her own dismissive argot-is outfitted in a yellow shirt and tight black shorts , lending the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Picabo is , however , nothing if not self-analytic . " Me , I keep the world moving fast . It 's really hard to relax , " she explains verbally , while indicating , physically , this truth . In a momentary lull in the action , she turns to Dugan . " Is this boring for you ? " she inquires of the canine . <p> Well , it is n't . No one in the company of Picabo Street is bored , otherwise he is dead . Picabo herself is sure she has lived a number of other lives , most recently as Amelia Earhart 's best friend . Right now , however , her current life is threatened , because of an accident a year ago at Vail , Colo . This is what she remembers : " I was so in control , going so fast . " But , then , around 95 miles per hour , a sudden bump loomed . Too late . " I took as much air as the men . And there I was , going about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " <p> Picabo windmills and everything on the living-room floor . Dugan is into this big time . He is not the least bit bored . <p> " You know , on a run , after you pass a certain speed , it all slows down , " she explains . " Your mind is like two sections down the course . You 're doing one thing and thinking what you have to do ahead . " But last year at Vail , it was different . She was out of control , taking air . " Like slow motion ! You see , I knew that as soon as I landed , I was going to blow out one leg-maybe both . That was the only question . One or both ? " <p> She mimes the crash , thudding onto the rug . Dugan is sympathetic . And , lying there , Picabo resumes the oral accounting : " My right leg is about a half-inch longer than my left , so I hit with it first , and then I came down on the left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is in the snow , simulating pain , curled up , fetally , then grabbing for her knee , and then , pounding the floor , as loud as she screamed it then , Picabo yells out a familiarly vulgar four-letter active verb , before she lies back with Dugan , remembering that awful moment , and remembering that even then , even before help reached her , she had started preparing for the rest of her life . <p> But , there is always a silver lining : Picabo only tore the anterior cruciate ligament in one leg , the right . <p> And so , this week at Val d'IsEre , France , almost a year to the day after that terrible crash , she will , at last , attempt again to race . Already , too , Picabo Street has decided that if-when !  --  she skis in the Olympics at Nagano , Japan , in two months , she will color her hair red , white and blue , with tips of gold , silver and bronze . <p> <p> There can not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly , CBS , the network of the ' 98 Games-who is not praying that Street will be ready to compete two months from now in Nagano . Not so long ago , the Winter Olympics were an equal festival of snow and ice , but over time , to the despair of skiing , it has changed . The sequined dolls of figure skating have completely stolen the show , and now that the National Hockey League is allowing their mean skates in , too , providing the ice yin to go with the ice yang , skiing may be reduced to a lounge act . <p> Moreover , if it were n't for the mountains themselves , one could even say that the whole sport of skiing has economically plateaued . Why , the resorts of Colorado-Colorado !  --  are actually turning more to golf . And now ! Just when skiing finally gets its quadrennial Warholian moment , here comes El NiNo threatening to do God-knows-what with Nagano and the other ski resorts of the world . <p> As it is , Alberto Tomba , the Italian dreamboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only skiers to have made any dent in the American consciousness . Indeed , Nike has issued a special Picabo number , though , alas , it is n't a snowshoe . <p> That Picabo has been Nike-ed is as much a tribute to her charm as to her talent . And if she does get her knee back , there is no reason she ca n't at last give skiing a grown-up personality to steal attention from the pocket-size teen queens of the ice . After all , she was the downhill silver medalist at Lillehammer in ' 94 , the World Cup champion in 1995-96 in the downhill , the only American woman ever to win that competition , and the only American , male or female , to win a World Cup title in more than a decade ( although Diann Roffe-Steinrott- rer in the super G and Tommy Moe in the downhill did take upset golds in the ' 94 Olympics ) . <p> So , Picabo was the real deal , one of those rare media-made creations to not only match the opening hype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the charm of the Picabo Story begins at the very , very beginning , with her conception , which , the legend tells us , occurred in a tent 9,000 feet up in the Sawtooth Mountains . There her parents , ' 60s people , were living off the land and into the ' 70s till their next unemployment checks arrived . Spontaneity then failed the Streets , Ron and Dee , and it took them a couple of years to name Picabo . But , well , the little thing liked to play peekaboo , and they had liked the flyspeck Idaho town of Picabo , which they had passed through some years previously while eloping . <p> So , Picabo , sometimes would you just as soon have been named something normal-chic , like Jessica or Sarah ? <p> " Elizabeth . There were times when Elizabeth would have been much better for me . Sometimes I feel like I have to be different because I am Picabo , but nine times out of 10 it works . But , one or two days a month , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too much money for someone my age , because you know Uncle Sam and me are in bed together , and sometimes I 'd just like not to be in the spotlight . Like , if suddenly , I had a nose ring , people would say : that does n't fit you , Picabo . " <p> Dugan seems to indicate that he prefers Picabo to Elizabeth . A wise dog would . Certainly , it is now Picabo who kneels , in a tuck on the rug , throwing her rear end up in the air , skiing-wise . " See , " she explains , " if I had a narrow waist and a big ass , if I had more curves-there 'd be more coils to fight . " Coils are wind ; impediments to the skier . Picabo imitates the wind . " More curves , more coils . You know , I feel as if I must have been put here to do this . I know it 's got to end some time , and then this thing I spent so much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of skiers , when they retire , the world is going too slow for them , and the people all around them seem too dumb . That 's why I ca n't always get into energy . I have to make myself relax . That 's why I spend a lot more time working on my person than on my skiing . " She hugs Dugan . <p> That makes sense . Certainly , the original contradiction to Picabo is that despite her laissez-faire upbringing by those flower parents , her competitive fires have always burned white hot . Aha , but when she is with a woman named Sapphire , whom she describes as her " energy reader , " it has been revealed that , in her previous lives , Picabo was much more subdued , reactive rather than proactive ; Elizabeth . <p> For example , once Picabo was an Indian woman married to her current beau , a fellow who must remain nameless for now . Picabo met him , despite herself , in Maui last January , right after her ACL operation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Oscar Hammerstein did . She says , " We saw each other across the floor , and we both thought : ' Yummy . ' And we both ducked our heads at the same time because we knew : ' Uh-oh . You ca n't go there ' . " <p> But they did . Once the two tourists spotted each other , it was destiny . The other day , for example , the boyfriend had a very important business meeting , and Picabo called him up . " Do you need some energy ? " she inquired . He said he would like that . " So I gave him mine , and it grounded me , and he said : ' Just what I needed , Babe ' . " Dugan nods ; he seems to understand about the energy . <p> The U.S. coach , Herwig Demscher , rushed to see her after her operation . Picabo says : " He came into the cast room , and all he could see was my feet way down the other end of the room . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the energy . " <p> She moves around the floor , simulating energy . " All my life , I 'll go along for a while , just cruising , and then I 'll grow . I 'll have a spurt . Well , I know : now I 'm going to have a spurt . " <p> Provisionally , this begins this week , upon the mountain at Val d'IsEre . Nagano lies but two more months away . Can you feel the energy ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Destiny 's Child : ' You know , I feel as if I must have been put here to do this ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Downhill racer : She takes so much air , she might have wings <p> By FRANK DEFORD <p>
