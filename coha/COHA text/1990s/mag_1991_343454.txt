Who 's heavyweight champ ? <P> Du n no . Muhammad Ali . Are n't the Celts on TV ? <P> O.K. , a hint : not Spinks . <P> Not which Spinks ? There was Leon and there was Michael . How about Women 's Full Contact Pro Beach Volleyball ? <P> No , look . There 's a war ; the sentry asks you a question to prove you 're American . Who 's heavyweight champ ? <P> Right . I got it , Mark Tyson . <P> It 's Mike , and no . Bang , you 're dead . <P> Nah , it 's boxing that 's dead , has been since Primo Carnera retired . It 's a sham and a shuck , lacking the je ne sais quoi of monster-truck racing and the visual appeal of a carton of eggs falling off the kitchen counter . Nobody cares except a couple dozen middle-aged sports editors . If those guys would unplug the publicity tubes . . . <P> Hey , check this out . Here 's a guy , Evander Holyfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion . <P> What 's he look like ? <P> Like he delivers for Federal Express . No one believes he 's a killer , El Supremo , Dr. Death . So this week Holyfield , who 's 28 , is going to bop this 42- year-old fat guy , George Foreman , on the beezer in Atlantic City . When Holyfield was in fourth grade , Foreman was heavyweight champ . <P> What 's the problem ? <P> Well , Foreman won his title by flattening Joe Frazier , who was no joke . ' Course that was back in ' 73 , and the next year Foreman lost to Ali in Zaire . Then he lost to Jimmy Young , who was n't a joke but was n't Godzilla either . Foreman quit fighting for 10 years and took up preaching . And eating . But then four years ago , he started fighting again . He beat 24 stiffs in a row , 23 by knockouts . <P> So you 're saying . . . ? <P> The fat old guy could win . <P> Sure . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about a two-George parlay ? Giggles or not , jiggles or not , a lot of comebacking is being attempted at the world-class level in sports . A reasonable citizen may wonder what Foreman , Bjorn Borg , Larry Holmes , Sugar Ray Leonard , Nancy Lieberman Cline , John McEnroe , Jim Palmer , Mark Spitz and Jill Sterkel have in common . A reasonable answer might be they 're nuts . They 're all trying , or trying to try , or have recently tried , comebacks , holding high the torch for middle-aged wheezers everywhere . <P> Doubters generally mention money in a disparaging way when the comeback phenomenon is discussed . Certainly there was a Dead Whale on a Flatcar quality when lardy ex-champ Larry Holmes , 41 , TKOed unranked opponent Tim ( " Doc " ) Anderson a couple of weeks ago in Florida . Later that night , perhaps to demonstrate unchainable ferocity , Holmes scuffled with fighter Trevor Berbick in a hotel driveway . Cameras running , of course . He got a scrawny $150,000 for the evening and bellyached about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get $12.5 million in pay-TV loot . It will take Roger Clemens , the mannerly Red Sox pitcher who is baseball 's highest-paid player , more than two years in the whirlpool to earn that much . But Foreman gives funnier interviews . He claims to have three sons , or five sons , named George Foreman , which is not just funny . It 's eerie .
