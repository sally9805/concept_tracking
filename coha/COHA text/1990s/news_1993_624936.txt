<p> WASHINGTON  --  President Clinton , hoping to deliver on his campaign promise to make America 's streets safe again , unveiled a major anti-crime proposal Wednesday that would place thousands more police officers on community beats and tighten federal gun control laws . <p> The crime legislation , to be introduced in Congress next month , would also restore the death penalty for the murder of federal officials and police officers and would limit the habeas corpus appeals process in capital murder cases . <p> The Clinton proposal , with an estimated price tag of more than $ 5 billion over five years , also emphasizes the need for better community-based policing programs in urban and rural areas and seeks to deter crime by establishing " " boot camps " for youthful offenders . It also creates a " " police corps " that would provide young people with college grants in return for a four-year commitment to law enforcement work in their communities . <p> " " The plan is tough ; it is fair , " Clinton declared at a White House Rose Garden announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement officials from around the country . <p> " " It will put police on the street and criminals in jail . It expands the federal death penalty to let criminals know that if they are guilty they will be punished . It lets law-abiding citizens know that we are working to give them the safety that they deserve , " he said . <p> Calling the crime package " " the major down payment " on his promise to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets during his presidency , Clinton said he would move immediately to tighten gun control laws by issuing an executive order to ban the imports of automatic assault-style handguns . The order would affect only a minute portion of the handgun import business , but it would curtail the spread of small automatic weapons such as the Israeli-made Uzi pistol now favored by street gangs and drug dealers . <p> The president said he plans to sign a second executive order tightening the federal regulations on gun dealers that currently allow just about anyone who pays the annual $ 30 licensing fee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity of being able to buy or sell a handgun more easily than obtaining a driver 's license , " Clinton said , adding that his battle plan against crime depends heavily on passage of the Brady gun-control bill that failed in Congress last year . <p> The bill , named for James Brady , the former White House press secretary wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan , mandates at least a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun to allow enough time for a police background check on the potential gun buyer . <p> Clinton was joined at the White House by Rep. Jack Brooks , D-Beaumont , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , and Sen. Joseph Biden , D-Del. , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee . <p> Both voiced support for the Clinton package , which adopts many of the proposals the two have offered in Congress before and a few that were also pushed by former President Bush . For example , Clinton and Bush share similar views on the reinstatement of the federal death penalty , which was overturned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " It 's time to fight crime with action , not slogans , " said Brooks . Brooks suggested that crime legislation had been turned into a political football over the years because politicians and special interest groups are more interested in striking a tough pose than making hard choices about how to deal with rising crime rates and street violence . <p> " " Our streets are flowing with blood , " Brooks said . " " The American public does n't want any more words that fly ever so lightly into the air signifying nothing . They 're tired of politicians vying with each other to prove just who 's tougher on crime . " <p> Flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and police officers from around the country , Clinton described his proposal as " " a major beginning of a long-term strategy to make America a more law-abiding , peaceful place . " He said his proposals would make Americans " " more secure and give our young people , wherever they live , a better chance to grow up , to learn , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " <p> " " The first duty of any government is to try to keep its citizens safe . But clearly too many Americans are not safe today , " Clinton said . <p> Reno has opposed the death penalty  --  even as a prosecutor in Miami . Nonetheless , she said she would support Clinton 's position on it in her position as attorney general . In comments after the president 's announcement , she stressed the importance of beefing up police forces around the country and providing more support for law enforcement efforts in rural areas of the country that she said had long been neglected . <p> She also described passage of the Brady bill as the all-important first step in turning the corner on crime . <p> " " If we 're serious about fighting crime , we must be serious about keeping guns out of the hands of criminals . You simply ca n't solve the crime problem if you do n't begin to address the gun problem , " she said . " " Passing the Brady bill is essential . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposal to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets . Most would be " " beat cops , " assigned to walk or patrol certain areas . The proposed legislation would earmark some $ 3.4 billion for beefing up law enforcement operations . <p> Another key element of the Clinton plan involves tightening of the habeas corpus appeals process in capital murder cases to end delays in imposing death sentences at the state level . The Clinton plan basically adopts the same legislation introduced last week by Sen. Biden that would limit state death row inmates to a single habeas corpus appeal to either the Supreme Court or a federal district court . The appeal would have to be made within six months after conviction . <p> The habeas corpus reform , however , would also ensure better representation for poor defendants by establishing new and tougher standards for state-appointed defense attorneys assigned to death penalty cases . <p> Other proposals include : <p> A $ 100 million police corps initiative that would provide college scholarships and grants to 5,000 students who make a four-year commitment to police work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create drug- and crime-free " " safe havens " in areas around secondary and elementary schools . <p> Creation of more youthful offender camps , where young , first-time criminals would serve out their sentences as an alternative to jail or prison incarcerations . <p> The president 's plan to fight crime <p> Details of President Clinton 's anti-crime plan , unveiled Wednesday : Since serious crime has increased 14.6% between ' 82 and ' 91 . <p> . . <p> ' 82 13 million . <p> ' 91 14.9 million . <p> . . suspended importation of foreign-made assault pistols . <p> . . <p> Number of imported firearms , 1992 : <p> Shotguns 442,000 . <p> Rifles 1.4 millions . <p> Handguns 982,000 . <p> Clinton wants to put 50,000 more police officers on the streets <p> Number of sworn officers , 1982 , 1991 and under plan : <p> ' 82 448,927 . <p> ' 91 535,629 . <p> Under plan 585,629 . <p> and enact other measures to make streets safer . <p> Review rules governing gun dealers . <p> Have Congress pass gun-controll legislation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community " " boot camps " for young criminals . <p> # As listed in the Crime Index : Include murder , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , larceny , theft and mother vehicle theft .
