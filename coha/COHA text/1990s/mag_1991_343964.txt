Should works of art carry a government health warning ? A piece being displayed at New York City 's New Museum of Contemporary Art could have used such a caveat . When Eclipse of the Earth by Kazuo Katase was installed last month , the work 's dusty red coloring agent contained zinc sulfide and barium sulfate . The chemicals caused severe respiratory and skin problems for some employees , they claim . A staff memo admitted that " ingestion of the pigment will cause illness , and the inhalation of the dust is known to cause lung irritation . " Although the powder was replaced 12 days later , three workers resigned and a fourth entered the hospital for treatment .
