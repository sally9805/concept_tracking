The 19th-century neighborhood of Bon Air is the perfect setting for new house that looks to the past with respect and still winks at the present with a few playful touches . Photograph Photograph To create the illusion of a house that has evolved over the years , architect Ernie Rose varied the rooflines and window configurations. // You would n't tell a dentist how to pull a tooth , " says Connie Rose . " So why would you tell an architect how to design a house ? " That sound philosophy explains her lovely new home and her happy 28-year marriage to architect Ernie Rose . Of course , Ernie wanted his wife 's opinion throughout the design . " But everything about the house is 100% Ernie , " says Connie . " Well , almost everything , " she adds . " He did install a phone jack where I asked for one . " The Roses had owned the property , a nice wooded lot in Richmond 's historic Bon Air suburb , for nearly seven years before starting construction . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1880s , the village of Bon Air was a thriving summer resort for families to escape the heat and congestion of the city , " explains Ernie . In its heyday , the town had a hotel , train station , and scores of summer homes . Today , only nine of the original cottages survive , yet someone touring the neighborhood might mistake the Roses ' new house for one of the old-timers . Like any sensitive designer , Ernie believes " context is key to good architecture . " So he looked around his neighborhood and assimilated its best characteristicsall the while giving the house its own distinctive spin . Their new home is like a favorite old maid aunt , possessing a fetching mix of modesty and indulgence . It radiates personality and even has a few slightly quirky traits . And rest assured , it should get even better with age . Acknowledging the street , the house has a two-story , gabled front that recalls rural , wood-frame structures typical of the region in the late 19th century . Lest anyone mistake Ernie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exaggerated the lines of the gable . He even admits that his box corners and wood trim are a bit overscaled . " The columns on the front porch are also slightly grander than they would have been on a modest village cottage from the 1880s , " says the architect . " But I wanted to prominently mark our front entrance . " He repeated the columns to lend an air of solidity and refinement to the back porch .

The table s irregular shape improves circulation around it . // One of the most refreshing things about Ernie 's design approach is his ability to mix the traditional with the personal , the modern with the handmade . The rooms in this house have an inviting flow and privacy without enclosure . A pair of columns is all that separates the living room from the sunroom , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of surprise around the corner . And the whole house seems to celebrate the process and pattern of natural light . In the morning , sunlight drenches the breakfast banquette ; the rays of the setting sun cast long shadows in the living room . Outside , a woodworking shop is one of Ernie 's favorite places to spend time . " I started working in wood as a teenager with my father , " he says , " and I picked it up again seriously about 10 years ago . " What started as a hobby has grown into a full-blown passion . He 's filled their home with a precious cargo of his own handiwork-he designed and crafted all of the built-in bookcases , kitchen cabinets , and benches . He also built much of the freestanding furniture . Photograph A cheerful sunroom extends and brightens one end of the living room . The built-in bench provides the main seating . // The Roses moved from a modern residence that Ernie designed more than 20 years ago . " Our boys could n't believe we wanted to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it did n't take them long to come around . " Although their new house could n't be more different from their old , Ernie believes that the style does n't really matter . When you build a new home , the distinctions are n't between old and new , contemporary and classical , or even good and bad . What really matters is beauty and function . Be open-minded and anything is possible-just take some time and look at the Roses .
