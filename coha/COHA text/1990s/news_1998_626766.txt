<p> Donna Harris and her mother carefully placed a pair of early 19th-century family portraits in the car in the early morning darkness Saturday in San Antonio and headed for Houston . It was 3 a.m . <p> When they arrived at Astroarena , next door to the Astrodome , four hours later , a long line of slightly sleepy but hopeful people was already winding around the building . They clutched vases , paintings , wind-up toys and jewelry they hoped would prove to be rare and valuable . The people at the head of the line had arrived at 4 a.m. from Louisiana . <p> Some brought antique chairs that turned out to be the perfect perch as lines , and the wait , got longer and longer . " Chubb 's Antiques Roadshow , " the popular PBS television show that goes from city to city giving free appraisals , finally had come to Houston . <p> As the 9 a.m. starting time approached , it looked like the Astros were playing for a Central Division championship , with traffic backed up on incoming streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event was 7,000 people or 3 p.m. , whichever came first . <p> " Roadshow " staffers opened the doors about 8 a.m. , giving each person a numbered admission ticket that would be exchanged for an appraisal category ticket . Within an hour , 4,000 people crowded the cavernous spaces of Astroarena . They were destined to inch slowly along in the roped-off lines before reaching the final destination , the appraisal area , and still more lines . <p> Regular viewers of " Chubb 's Antiques Roadshow " on Channel 8 are familiar with the lines of people holding their treasures in the background as experts give selected owners the good - or not so good - news about their objects . <p> Sometimes the cameras pan around to show the 50-60 appraisals going on at once . Banners ranging from " Pottery &; Porcelain " to " Textiles " and " Collectibles " hang above appraisers sitting behind long tables . <p> In the center of the space , four small filming areas stay busy , either shooting a special appraisal or preparing to shoot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troupe . <p> Approximately 50 appraisals are filmed during a " Roadshow " event . Out of those , 12-15 will actually appear on the hourlong show . The events being filmed this summer will make up the third season of " Roadshow , " starting in early 1999 . In some cities , they end up with enough good appraisals for two shows . Roadshow host Chris Jussel said Saturday that the possibility of two Houston shows was looking good . <p> For those who could not easily carry their treasures , the favorite means of hauling them included flight bags on wheels , wagons and even baby buggies . Elizabeth Major pulled the wooden wagon her husband , Bob , used in the early 1950s to deliver the Evening Star , a now-defunct Washington , D.C. , newspaper . The sturdy wagon with the paper 's name in faded letters on the side serves as a coffee table with a glass on top in the Majors ' home , but on Saturday it carried objects for two women and doubled as a seat while they waited in line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he patiently waited in line with a giant ship 's wheel propped on a mover 's dolly . The wooden wheel , about 6 feet in diameter and looking like something from an old pirate movie , has been in his family about 50 years , but its origin is a mystery to him . <p> It was a long wait but well worth the effort for Donna Harris . She began to tremble as the cameras turned away about 2 p.m. and the words of Ron Bourgeault of Northeast Auctions , Portsmouth , N.H. , started to sink in . <p> The two unframed portraits showed Harris ' great-great-great grandparents on their wedding day , Sept. 7 , 1813 , in New Hampshire . She had that original information preserved in old envelopes . <p> " When I saw these , I thought I was back in New Hampshire , not at the Astrodome in Houston , " Bourgeault said , admiring the portraits painted by Zedekiah Belknap in oil with asphalt mixed in . He called them especially nice because of their good condition and because they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Hang these as they are . They should never be cleaned , framed or retouched , " he advised Harris . Then he gave her the good news , the estimated value : $ 8,000 to $ 12,000 for the pair . <p> Condition plays a major role in the value of an antique and is often the reason for a lower appraisal . One couple who brought in a dining suite of early 20th-century Gustav Stickley furniture - hot on today 's antiques market - learned its potentially high value was cut in half because it had been refinished . <p> Toy expert Noel Barrett of Birchrunville , Pa. , gently told 9-year-old Madison Grieco and her mother , Beverle Grieco , that her collection of old stuffed animals was obviously well loved but not of much value because of poor condition . <p> A menu from the Titantic , dated April 14 , 1912 , was attached to the back of a small watercolor of the ill-fated ocean liner . The painting with the menu on back was purchased by the owner in 1970 in Southampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the menu 's worth was estimated at $ 75,000-$ 100,000 . The knowledgeable appraiser knew of one existing menu , not in excellent condition like this one , and suggested it might have been saved by one of the ship 's survivors , such as a steward . <p> Months before the " Roadshow " event , Houston viewers were urged to mail in photographs of furniture they wanted appraised , along with any available information . The pieces would be selected in advance and transported to the Astroarena and returned home by the " Antiques Roadshow . " <p> Approximately 525 people sent in furniture pictures , and 12 pieces were chosen to be filmed . One of special interest to Texans is a surprisingly fancy desk made by Austin cabinetmaker Adolph Kempen in the 1870s . It belongs to Hermann Von Rosenberg of Baytown , whose grandfather won it at an Austin charity raffle in 1875 . <p> The Kempen desk is pictured and described in " Texas Furniture : The Cabinetmakers and Their Work , " 1840-1880 , by Lonn Taylor and David B. Warren ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited in the prestigious Tri-Delta Antiques Show in Dallas in 1986 . Von Rosenberg cherishes a photograph of honorary show chairman Lady Bird Johnson standing by his desk . <p> Leslie Keno of Sotheby 's placed a value of $ 8,000-$ 12,000 on the Texas desk . <p> The big buzz among " Roadshow " staff and volunteers from Chubb insurance agencies and Channel 8 was Nathan Watrous , 17 , of Baytown and his guitar signed by rock guitar legend Jimi Hendrix . <p> According to family lore , Watrous ' grandfather , who bought the Carlos guitar for $ 20 , had it in a Greenwich Village bar in the late 1960s where Hendrix autographed it , played it and " smashed " it - his signature move . Kathleen Guzman of Phillips Auction House in New York called it a " really great piece of memorabilia worth $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 . " <p> Luddie Williams of Baytown , Watrous ' grandmother , jumped up and down and clapped with excitement out of camera range . Packing up the guitar afterward , she declared : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many in the long , lethargic lines talked to those around them and compared their objects , but some were discouraged by the wait and gave up . By 3 p.m. police at the parking lot entrance were telling arrivers the " Roadshow " doors were closed . <p> Later in the afternoon , additional appraisal tables were set up in the large waiting area to speed up the process . Approximately 75 appraisers worked the event in Houston , the largest group used since the show started . Next Saturday the " Roadshow " will continue the hunt for undiscovered treasures in Milwaukee , winding up the eight-city search Aug. 29 in Richmond , Va .
