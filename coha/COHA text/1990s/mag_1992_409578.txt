George Bush and Bill Clinton have the power of established political organizations behind them , but when it comes to the fervor of their supporters , neither can touch Ross Perot . Starting in February , when Perot declared on CNN 's Larry King Live that he would run for President if he could get on the ballot in all 50 states , his built-on-the-fly bandwagon has picked up astonishing speed . ( So far , Perot has been officially placed on the ballot in 13 states . ) In the month of April , the Dallas-based billionaire reported spending $850,000 of his own money to fund the effort , partly to cover the rent for headquarters in 42 cities and towns . But in many cases , his supporters  --  the true believers  --  have been paying his way on their own , kicking in contributions and juggling their regular jobs to help make his unannounced candidacy a reality . The Perotistas have been chastised by some critics for displaying an enthusiasm too close to blind faith . Perhaps even more than traditional politicians , Perot has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the economy and the environment . But his supporters profess not to care much . As our recent sampling suggests , they have flocked to him for pretty much the same reasons that many other people choose their candidates : a little substance , a lot of style , and a hunch . FOR ONE NOVICE , A QUICK EDUCATION IN CAMPAIGN TACTICS , AND RAPID PROMOTION If Perot fails to carry Michigan , it wo n't be because Judy Werner did n't give her all . Each morning , often as early as 5:30 A.M. , she leaves her $400,000 house in the exclusive Detroit suburb of Grosse Ile and drives 20 miles to the Royce Hotel in working-class Romulus , southwest of the city . There she presides over 5,000 other statewide volunteers as the chairwoman of Perot 's Michigan petition effort . On an average day Werner , 54 , who has never met or spoken to Perot , puts in about eight she has gained 10 lbs . from lack of exercise and has hardly seen her husband , Richard . So far about the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one of his bumper stickers on her black $55,000 Jaguar Vanden Plas . " How would you get it off ? " she asks . As is the case with many Perot supporters , this is Wetner 's first foray into organized politics . In past elections she ping-ponged between the Republicans and Democrats , voting for JFK , Nixon ( whom she still describes as " a very honest man " ) , Carter , Reagan and Dukakis . But this year she decided she 'd had enough of the major parties , mainly because of what she sees as their lassitude in confronting the country 's economic problems . She and her husband run Solar Machine Products , an auto-supply company in Romulus that makes transmission and engine parts . Battered by the recession , the company now has only 125 employees , half the number it had in 1981 . " I may be politically naive , but I do n't like what I 'm seeing in this country , " she says . " We 're not moving ahead . " After watching Perot on Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had requested , along with a letter volunteering to head the Michigan campaign . Two weeks later a producer from NBC 's Today show called and mentioned that Perot 's people in Dallas had provided her name as the state chairwoman . It was the first response she 'd gotten from her earlier offer , but she quickly jump-started the statewide operation , which in the space of 14 weeks rounded up some 120,000 petition signatures , far more than the 25,646 needed to put Perot on the ballot in Michigan . Despite her sense of accomplishment , Werner acknowledges that her efforts have created a few problems in her life . For one thing , her husband , though a Perot supporter himself , is not nearly so ardent and is not entirely happy about the disruption of the Werners ' home and their business . " It means I do n't make dinner five times a week , and I get behind in the office and social life , " she says . And there are other concerns . Now that she is in the public eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra panty hose , a toothbrush and a can of hair spray . " I never needed all this stuff before , " she says . " But when I do n't have it , for sure I get a run , or my hair flops before a TV interview . " OUT OF WORK , BUT NOT OUT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR HIS CANDIDATE When he first took over as the Perot committee 's press liaison in Los Angeles County , Mike Ruppert was working full-time as a sales representative for a private investigation firm . But holding down two jobs quickly became too much . In one 3-1/2-hour period he received 31 Perot-related calls at his office . His boss told him he had to choose between his job or his political work . Ruppert , 41 , chose Perot . " I felt bad and guilty , but this was more important , " he says . " I 've been waiting 15 years for this movement to come along , whether it was Ross Perot or somebody else . It may sound corny , but I lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unannounced Perot campaign must often depend more on the enthusiasm of volunteers than the soundness of their judgment . Ruppert , who is unmarried , has no savings . To make matters worse , his wisdom teeth are infected . An unpaid volunteer for Perot , he is receiving unemployment compensation of $176 a week . For Ruppert , this is not the first time his life has intersected with Perot 's . A former narcotics officer with the Los Angeles Police Department , he claims that in the course of investigations in the mid- ' ' 70s he came across evidence that the CIA was trading drugs in order to fund covert operations in the Middle East . Disillusioned , he says , he left the force in 978 and tried to expose the scandal , supporting himself by working for private security outfits and as a free-lance writer . Ruppert says that twice in recent years he wrote to Perot , who has raised a few conspiracy scenarios himself . He says Perot called him back to offer encouragement . But at the moment , Ruppert says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader worthy of its people . Even for Ross Perot , those will be big shoes to fill . REACHING BACK TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS FOR INSPIRATION As a direct descendant of Benjamin Franklin , Laurence Williams might be expected to know something about launching a grass-roots rebellion . In fact Williams , 49 , a hotel consultant who lives in Chatham , Mass. , on Cape Cod , tends to see Perot as the living embodiment of his **43;132;TOOLONG legacy . " In both men the patriotism is tremendous , " he says . " The leadership is there , and do n't forget the versatility . " A former Republican , Williams became ripe for a conversion to Perotism alter last year 's controversy over congressional pay raises . " I knew then both parties were in cahoots , " he says . " They 'd point to each other like crazy but then make deals with each other . That sealed it for me . " Inside Williams 's four-bedroom home the phone rings day and night . As one of the nine members of the Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about 30 hours a week chatting up potential supporters and brainstorming with other organizers . His wife , Marie , 47 , who usually votes Republican , has n't objected so far to the time and distractions and in fact has decided that she will go for Perot in November as well . Meanwhile , Williams insists that whether it is successful or not , the campaign should be seen as a noble effort , both on the part of supporters and of Perot himself . " It 's not an ego trip , " he says . " It 's a stewardship thing , like Franklin talks about . The exciting thing is watching people take responsibility . " AT A SIDEWALK PETITION STATION , A HEALTHY DOSE OF HOPE For the past six years Nancy Carter has been in and out of hospitals , undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for cancer . The ravages of the disease , and the treatment , forced Carter , 69 , to stop eating solid food a year ago . As a result she must spend 10 hours a night hooked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains essential vitamins and minerals . And yet Carter has spent precious hours at a table outside a San Diego supermarket encouraging passersby to sign a petition to put Perot on the California ballot ; more recently she has been working the phone on Perot 's behalf . It is a sacrifice she is delighted to make . " I get a little tired , " she says . " I 'm expanding a lot of energy , but I 'm also doing something I believe in , so that gives me a little pick-me-up . " A longtime Republican , Carter thinks Perot is the ideal candidate to deal with such issues as industrial decline , the budget deficit and the continuing fallout from the savings-and-loan scandal . But what really caught her attention is his interest in education . A teacher who spent 20 years instructing fifth graders in the Chula Vista , Calif. , school system , Carter notes that in 1984 Perot headed a Texas commission on education reform that tackled the state 's cherished pastime  --  high school football  --  and won , mandating that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . " He took on the bureaucracy and de-emphasized sports , " she says . Carter is so enthusiastic about Perot that she spent $50 of her own money to make copies of articles about him for distribution . Divorced , with no children and two dogs , Carter devotes almost all her waking hours to her medical needs and her newfound political cause . As she sat outside the supermarket recently , a middle-aged man wandered up , paused , and blurted , " Who 's Ross Perot ? Is he going to be our next President ? " Beaming , Carter retorted , " You bet ! " A VIETNAM VET WHO SEES A WAY OUT OF THE POLITICAL QUAGMIRE Ask Neal Pollack where he grew up and he answers , " Saigon . " In fact he was raised in Chicago , but he regards his 21-month Army tour in Vietnam , including action during the 1968 Tet Offensive , as the time he truly came of age . Now 46 and a jewelrymaker outside Carbondale , Colo. , Pollack is a hard-core vet . His 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOYCOTT JANE FONDA ... AMERICAN TRAITOR B  --  . He is an even more emphatic ' Perot supporter . He admits that he is not entirely clear on the particulars of Perot 's agenda . But what Pollack thinks he does know is that Perot wo n't back down from what he believes . He is impressed by Perot 's concern for veterans ' issues , and he is enthralled by the billionaire 's taste for derring-do , as evidenced by Perot 's rescue in 979 of two employees held captive in Iran . " I remember thinking , " What a stud , what an hombre , " " says Pollack . " Here 's how a guy 's supposed to act , none of this hiding behind rules and regulations . " Each day , Pollack , a self-employed goldsmith who creates expensive custom jewelry , leaves his wife , Jean , and their 11-acre ranch and heads into Carbondale ( pop . 3,000 ) to cheek the mailbox and round up potential Perot supporters . At this point , backers in Colorado have more than enough signatures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to line up people to vote for their candidate in November . Mulling the prospect of an administration headed by a man with scant political experience , Pollack has no qualms . " I know it 's going to be different , " he says . " I do n't know it will be better . But there 's no way he could make the country worse . " A PARAMEDIC WHO BELIEVES THAT RESCUE FOR THE COUNTRY IS AT HAND Ross Perot may be short on height ( 5 ' ' 6 " ) , but as far as Fred Dosch is concerned , he lacks nothing in stature . Dosch , 38 , a paramedic for the emergency services unit of the Riviera Beach , Fla. , fire department , regards Perot as nothing less than one of the century 's giants . " Perot is like Walt Disney or Winston Churchill , " says Dosch . " He is a leader who believes in idealism and people 's ability to make things happen . He sees America is at a crossroads , and he seems to offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a hardy band of disciples to spread the faith , which is where Dosch and those like him come in . After gathering signatures for the petitions that got Perot on the ballot in Florida last month , Dosch has continued to drum up support , even using his beloved short-wave radio at home to spread the word . " My grandfather fought in World War I , my father in World War II , both to make life better for their children , " says Dosch , who has a pregnant wife , Peggy , 33 , and a son , Brandon 5 . " I am spending 12 hours a week doing the same for my kid . I owe it to him . " Indeed , his obsession with Perot has become a family affair . Peggy , who runs a discount specialty store in Jupiter , is a supporter and even young Brandon has caught the bug . " He picks out Ross on the television news , " says his proud father . " He points out his face in the newspaper . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
