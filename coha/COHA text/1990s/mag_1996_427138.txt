At long last , a bright comet appears to delight astronomers and the general public . // It 's Friday , March 22 , and I 'm sitting on the deck looking skyward , after scarfing a quick dinner . The comet is brilliant now , mocking the purpose of hastily-constructed maps from the office . Comet Hyakutake ( 1996 Bsub 2 ) gleams softly overhead , its big , blobby coma three times the size of the Moon . Its greenish-white tail stretches from fascinated as much by the new word comet as by the fact that he is looking at a chunk of dirty ice whizzing past Earth a mere 9 million miles away . For thousands of backyard astronomers and the public at large , it seemed like a dream , or a flashback to the glory days of Comet West in 1976 . But the new bright comet , discovered by Japanese amateur Yuji Hyakutake ( yah-koo-tahkee ) on January 30 , 1996 , who used 25x150 binoculars , was no dream . On calculating the comet 's orbit , astronomers found it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcturus on its speedy northward route and landed as a circumpolar object . Its brightness and tail length exceeded even the most optimistic predictions : by March 19 it shone at 2nd magnitude and displayed a 5deg-long tail , the coma appearing fan-shaped with a jet or two visible near the nucleus .

Under a very dark sky , observers reported tail lengths of 1000 . It was a shocking sight to those who had never before seen a bright comet . And the national news media , roused from their slumbers of dull comets from recent years , awoke with an explosive round of coverage , much of it garbling the facts of what the comet is and how to best see it . Despite this , amateurs around the globe took notice . Mike Beauchamp of Marquette , Michigan , describes his view on March 7 with a 10-inch reflector : " It appeared as a dimly glowing patch of light with a bright center , reminding me of a small globular cluster . " But two weeks later , on March 20 , atop Mauna Kea , Hawaii , John Dvorak used 10x50 binoculars and described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine structure and streaks readily seen along the tail . Wow ! " A night later , I observed the comet from a relatively good suburban site . I watched the comet for several hours with the naked eye , 7x35 binoculars , a 4 1/4inch reflector , and an 8-inch SCT . The small reflector at 16x provided by far the most satisfying view , with the fan-shaped coma easily visible and a tail that stretched beyond an entire field . At low power in the 8-inch , however , the brilliant , condensed shining ball of the inner coma , surrounded by the huge , gauzy outer coma , struck me as amazing . On the same night , Brian Skiff observed the comet from a dark sky location at Anderson Mesa , Arizona . " The comet is simply stunning , " he wrote . " The tail goes right to the zodiacal band where it merges with the gegenschein , passing between Gamma and Delta Virginis - check those charts , boys and girls , that 's 30deg ! " " Skiff went on to record a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars and estimated the comet 's brightness as magnitude 1.7 . The core of the coma appeared " not quite stellar , " said Skiff , who made the point that at closest approach the image scale of the comet would be 75 km/arcsecond , enough to see country-sized features on the comet 's image . On the 21st the comet moved along at 17.5 ' per hour , so that motion was visible in a few minutes when using binoculars .

At its brightest on March 25 , the comet surprised everyone . Atop Mauna Kea , Dvorak recorded that the tail stretched " from the head of the comet near the Little Dipper to Coma Berenices - that 's 50deg . What a sight ! " Normand Matte of Montreal wrote that he " just had to tell someone the pleasure I had of seeing my first comet . " He did n't believe it would be so easy to observe with his own eyes until seeing it for himself . The first blush for Comet Hyakutake was over : The comet had redeemed the tarnished reputation of recent poor showings by other , hyped comets . Next month 's issue will continue our coverage .
