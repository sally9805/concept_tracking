Section : THE VISION THING <p> Dateline : WASHINGTON , D.C. <p> President Bush is getting it from all sides now . A few days after he lobbed the tax grenade into the hands of his supporters here , he set off to London to patch up the differences among America 's allies in NATO . During the following press conference , however , a reporter threw in a little bomb of his own by bringing up the case of Fang Lizhi , the Chinese astrophysicist who had arrived in Britain a week earlier after almost a year in America 's Peking embassy . What did the President think , the reporter asked , of Fang 's comments to NBC criticizing Washington for its " double standard " on human rights in China ? Fang also suggested that Bush owed him a dinner , a reference to the one he had missed in April 1989 when the Chinese authorities prevented him from going . <p> " I thought he wanted to stay out of the public eye , " said the President , obviously taken aback . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a little different information than that . . . " <p> Small in itself , the incident nonetheless revealed a great deal about Bush 's continuing trouble with " the vision thing . " Instead of instantly pointing out that Fang was a free man because of American intercession and that free men have the right to say what they please , the President gave the impression that Fang ought to have kept quiet . True , he did say he was " heartened " by the release , but not until after he had implied that Fang had somehow violated an understanding . Instead of getting the credit he deserved for Fang 's liberty , the President once again looked as if his main concern was not to say anything that might offend Deng Xiaoping . <p> In contrast to Ronald Reagan , George Bush prides himself on being both a " pragmatist " and , in the case of China , a specialist in his own right , having served as the first chief of the U.S. mission to Peking in 1974-75 . Bush thus sees " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces his ability to maneuver . In fact , it 's precisely his lack of a philosophical compass that calls into question his every move . One year after Party elders sent in tanks against unarmed student demonstrators , the American people still do not know which side their President is on . <p> Now , obviously the President was as outraged over the bloodshed at Tiananmen Square as any other American , probably more so than the Democrats in Congress who for the previous ten years had been telling everyone what a liberal Deng was . In addition , the recent decision to allow Dan Quayle to meet with escaped student leader Chai Ling and the relatively cool attitude toward loans for China at the just-ended economic summit in Houston suggest that the White House is taking a tougher line these days . But in public the President still comes across as Deng 's loyal tennis partner , with the consequence that even when he 's right  --  renewing China 's Most Favored Nation status to keep Western influence alive  --  all he does is split his own party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoralize those elements within China that look to America for inspiration . <p> " In China , the man on the street is saying to himself , Deng Xiaoping must be very powerful because the President is sending people to China and not the other way around , ' " says the soft-spoken Chai Ling , whose own escape attests to the grave risks Chinese were willing to take by sheltering her . Here in town to take her case to Congress , Miss Chai says that she does not want America to " give up all your power and influence in China " by revoking MFN ; she just wants some conditions attached . <p> That 's a modest enough position , and it has long been argued by Reagan 's ambassador to the PRC , Winston Lord . Unfortunately , President Bush appears to have been seduced into thinking that his own personal relationship with Deng and other Chinese leaders could actually effect what he wanted . Thus the secret trips to Peking by National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qian Qichen and saying that they needed to take " bold measures " against the " negative forces " in China and the U.S. " who seek to redirect or frustrate our cooperation "  --  a blunder of incalculable proportions . <p> " This is a problem of the President 's own making , " says Arthur Waldron , professor of Chinese history at Princeton , " and it comes from the failure to realize there are limits to our possibilities in China . Once you send a Scowcroft or an Eagleburger over , you have to get a big prize in return . " <p> Instead , Bush handed his opponents a stick to beat him with . Indeed , the bill introduced by Senator George Mitchell ( D. , Me. ) to revoke MFN status for China has just been referred to the Finance Committee ; barring some new thuggishness from China it wo n't pass , but it is worth noting that the bill is co-sponsored by Jesse Helms ( R. , N.C. ) . Even those Republicans who upheld the President 's veto of the Pelosi bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy , given Bush 's reluctance to live up to his promise to provide the same protection for the students with an executive order . The general distrust is compounded by indignation that the PRC consulates apparently feel free to intimidate pro-reform students on U.S. soil . Sending the Right Signals <p> It 's hard to imagine Ronald Reagan in this fix , and not only because no Reagan national security advisor would have been photographed toasting a Communist Party chief just months after a massacre of peaceful demonstrators . Reagan would have instinctively had some Chinese students over to the Rose Garden as a signal to the world that this was where America stood . And that in turn would have given him a freer hand in policy , because no one would be misinterpreting his moves . Indeed , it 's significant that although the Bush Administration 's one symbolic moment of principle  --  the Vice President 's meeting with Miss Chai  --  provoked a harsh reaction from Peking , it was n't long afterward that the Chinese finally agreed to allow Fang and his wife to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an anecdote revolving around his Chinese-born wife . They had been watching a Reagan speech on Lithuania , wherein the former President started out with a somewhat confusing chronicle of that country 's sufferings , alluding to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 1939 and winding the whole thing up by saying that anything Hitler and Stalin agreed on had to be bad . Watching all this , the woman turned to her husband and said , " You know , he may not get all his details right , but he really knows how to explain things to people .
