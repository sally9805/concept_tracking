Section : CRISIS IN THE GULF SPECIAL REPORT Bush turns up the heat on Saddam  --  and considers a ' messy compromise ' <p> The music blaring from the White House Wurlitzer last week was all martial . President Bush turned up the heat on Saddam Hussein with yet another deployment to the Persian Gulf . Administration sources later said the new forces would number about 150,000 , bringing the total close to 400,000 . The president made no , no pretense of depending Saudi Arabia . The mission was to provide an " offensive military option . " <p> The sounds from Baghdad betrayed high anxiety . " If the fire of aggression is unleashed against Iraq , " blustered the government newspaper al-Jumhuriya , " flames will cover everything ... and will burn in every direction . " Logic pointed toward war : unreason seemed about to engulf the feeble murmur of diplomacy . <p> Despair is premature . Despite its rhetoric , the Bush administration would be willing to accept what senior officials call " a messy compromise " allowing Saddam to win something after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for pushing the Mideast to the brink of war , one senior official told NEWSWEEK but " Saddam does have a facesaving way out should he choose it . " To be sure , he would have to abandon Kuwait without preconditions . But Washington would n't object if he went with winks and nods from his Arab neighbors . As long as a decent interval elapsed , the United States would not interfere with negotiations among what the official called the " happy Arab family . " If these fellow Arabs wanted to meet some of Saddam 's demands for a secure port on the Persian Gulf or a slice of a rich Kuwait oilfield , that would be their business . <p> The real question is whether Saddam would take such a deal . " No one has come back with any sense that Saddam is wearing down , changing his mind , " worried a top Bush aide . The White House believes that Saddam will leave Kuwait only if he understands that war is imminent . The buildup is the " bad cop " of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh hour has arrived . <p> If he remains unconvinced , the clock will strike 12 not long after the New Year . The buildup announced last week will take two months to achieve . The Pentagon is adding three and one-third armored divisions  --  and some 1,100 tanks  --  to the two and one-third heavy divisions and 800 tanks the Army has already poised in the desert . The hope is that a massive aerial bombardment would rout Iraqi forces dug in around Kuwait . But no one expects air power to do the job alone . American ground forces would have to follow . The Pentagon is no longer talking about rotating troops home after six months . The soldiers in the desert are there for the duration . But they can not hang on indefinitely , and already time and weather are wearing down morale and equipment . Pentagon planners say that Bush will have to strike this winter , while he has a maximum fresh force in the field  --  and before desert sandstorms begin in spring . <p> Baker returned last week hopeful that most members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military strike . Washington would like to win a United Nations resolution authorizing such action to use as a psychological club against Saddam . But some allies , notably the Soviets , seemed to want more time before taking a step that could make the way to war a little too clear . <p> Suppressed smile : Among the five permanent members of the U.N . Security Council  --  the United States , Britain , France , the Soviet Union and China  --  the key is the Kremlin . In Moscow last week Secretary Baker had to suppress a smile when Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters that the " use of force could not be ruled out . " Baker believes the Soviets will eventually sign on to a U.N . resolution . President Bush will try to knot the deal when he meets Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a minisummit in Paris next Sunday . <p> The Soviets are playing a careful game in the gulf , trying to please both Washington and their old Arab clients ( page 25 ) . The Kremlin would like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov has been shuttling between Moscow , Washington and Baghdad . It was Primakov who in early October floated the first hint of compromise from Saddam : withdrawal in return for the Rumaila oilfield and the islands of Warba and Bubiyan at the head of the gulf . After some tough words from Bush , Primakov told Saddam at a meeting in late October that he must abandon all of Kuwait first . Saddam balked . But Primakov saw a ray of hope . " When I put it quite definitely to him , ' If you do n't withdraw , there will be a military strike against you , ' he showed he was in a position to do something , " said Primakov . The Soviet envoy did not elaborate on the " something , " and Gorbachev later told Baker he saw no encouraging signs from Saddam . <p> At the moment , the Saudi and Kuwait royal families are unrelenting in their hostility to Saddam Hussein . But many Saudis  --  and certainly many Egyptians  --  are leery of a war pitting Arab against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would settle for a policy of containing him within Iraq . Ideally , all American troops would go home , but a tripwire Arab ground force backed by U.S. air and naval forces and U.S. stockpiled equipment would remain to deter Iraqi aggression . <p> The United States will want some restraints on Saddam 's chemical- and nuclear-war potential . But any arms-control regime would raise an awkward question : would Israel have to abide by the same rules ? The Israelis have always refused to give up their nuclear monopoly in the region . Now that Saddam has the capacity to build a bomb  --  and other wealthy Arab nations have the resources to buy one  --  the United States hopes that Israel will accept some limits on nuclear weapons . But bringing Israel into the peace equation raises another sticky problem : no regional security arrangement is possible unless Israel resolves the Palestinian issue . <p> Saddam might not trust his Arab brothers , much less Washington or Tel Aviv , to honor a compromise . He could well choose to fight . Although he has been warned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to doubt America 's staying power . Figuring that the American public would not stand fore protracted war , he might let the killing begin to see who would last the longest . In its bloody war against Iran , Iraq lasted eight years . Such calculation would be wrong : once the body bags began coming home President Bush would have to achieve victory to justify the cost . But then most wars are born of miscalculation . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Heating up : Bush annouces deployment , U.S. First Cavalry in Saudi Arabia <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : George Bush <p> EVAN THOMAS with ANN MCDANIEL , THOMAS M.
