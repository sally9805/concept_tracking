In mid-December Earth passes through a swarm of tiny dust particles left behind by a comet orbiting the Sun . As Earth fords this meteor stream , many of those particles slam into our atmosphere , vaporizing as they fall . Their fiery demise creates a light show in our night sky called the Geminid meteor shower . Watchful observers should see approximately 60 meteors per hour , or one a minute , under dark country skies before dawn on December 14 . Witnessing the shower under a dark sky will be more difficult than in most years , however . The waxing gibbous Moon sets only about three hours before the Sun rises on the morning of the 14th , washing the sky with its silvery light for most of the night . You have only a narrow window for seeing a good display , after the Moon sets and before dawn begins to light the sky . Be sure to gather some warm clothes before trekking to a dark rural site . Geminid meteors appear to radiate from near the star Castor in the constellation Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant rises in the early evening and passes nearly overhead around 2 a.m . But do n't stare at the radiant . Even though the meteors appear to emanate from this point , the length of a meteor 's trail grows the farther it is from the radiant . Your best bet is to simply lie back and scan a wide area of sky with your naked eye . As Geminid meteors streak overhead , you will no doubt notice a bright orange-reddish light high in the southeast . This is the Red Planet , Mars , which rises around 10 p.m. in mid-December and lies near the bright star Regulus in the constellation Leo . At magnitude 0.0 , Mars now shines more than a magnitude brighter than Regulus , and the planet 's ruddy color contrasts nicely with the white star . On December 8 , the planet passes 2deg north of Regulus in the first of three conjunctions between the two in 1994-95 . Mars grows to 10 " in apparent diameter this month , surpassing what many telescope observers consider the minimum size for seeing detail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way if we did n't have 10 fingers and 10 toes ? No matter . The important thing is that it now looms large enough that observers armed with medium-sized telescopes can see many subtle surface features . The brightest planet , Venus , reaches greatest brilliancy on December 9 , when it can be found in the southeast before dawn shining with astounding brilliance at magnitude 4.7 . Another very bright object , the second-brightest planet , lies below Venus that morning . It is Jupiter , which rises earlier and thus climbs higher in the southeastern predawn sky with each passing morning . By late December , Jupiter rises only an hour after Venus . The waning crescent Moon appears between the dazzling duo on the morning of December 29 . Comet Borrelly rides high in the northern sky on these December nights . Glowing at 8th magnitude among the stars of Ursa Major , the comet is an easy binocular target . It passes closest to Earth , at a distance of about 60 million miles , on December 4 . The brightest asteroid , 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Earth passes more or less between this minor planet and the Sun . On that date Vesta lies in far northern Orion and shines at magnitude 6.3 , near the limit of naked-eye visibility . You should be able to spot it with the naked eye from a pitch-black observing site , but the task will be easier if you first find it with binoculars . Vesta can be a magnitude brighter if opposition coincides with perihelion ( its closest point to the Sun ) , but Vesta was farthest from the Sun in early October . December rates as an exceptional month for bright asteroids . On December 4/5 , 8 Flora comes to opposition among the background stars of northwestern Orion , but by midmonth it moves into Taurus . At magnitude 8.0 , it glows brighter than any other asteroid this year , with the exceptions of Vesta and Ceres . Telescopic observers will want to watch as Saturn continues eclipsing its own satellites . Viewers should also note the planet 's rings , which appear increasingly edge-on as seen from our vantage point . Earth will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings of Saturn will seem to disappear . DECEMBER 'S PLANETS Uranus and Neptune lie low in the southwest after sunset as December begins , barely shining through the gathering dusk . By the end of December they have disappeared in the Sun 's glare , preparing to pass behind the Sun in January . Saturn shines gently in the south as darkness falls , setting before midnight . Although the planet appears somewhat fainter , at magnitude 1.0 , than it did this past summer or fall , it remains much brighter than the stars of its host constellation , Aquarius . Telescopic observers should view Saturn early in the evening while it is still fairly high in the sky and its light does n't have to traverse as much of Earth 's image-blurring atmosphere . Just about the time Saturn sets , Mars rises above the eastern horizon . The Red Planet brightens rapidly this month as Earth comes closer to passing between it and the Sun next February . It shines at magnitude 0.3 on December 1 and magnitude - 0.3 on the 31st , a gain in brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet passes 2deg north of 1st-magnitude Regulus , the brightest star in the constellation Leo . A telescope reveals Mars as a much more intriguing place than it was earlier this year . The planet 's disk now appears 10 " in diameter , and some normally subtle details should be coming into view . In particular the Martian north polar cap appears prominent because the planet 's northern hemisphere is now only two months into spring and that hemisphere tilts toward Earth . Mars is the only planet visible from late evening when Saturn sets until about 4 a.m . The next planet to appear is the brightest of all , Venus , a brilliant beacon shining in the southeastern sky . This planet reaches greatest brilliancy on December 9 , when it shines at magnitude - 4.7 . A peek through a telescope reveals a large disk  --  40 " in diameter  --  that 's less than 30 percent illuminated . Venus lies in Virgo when the month begins , a little below and to the left of Spica , Virgo 's brightest star . During the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beta Librae , also known as Zubenelgenubi and Zubeneschamali , after midmonth . It remains in Libra through the end of the year . Meanwhile , as the days pass , look for another bright planet to emerge below Venus in the predawn twilight sky . This is Jupiter , the largest planet in our solar system and the second-brightest as seen from Earth . At magnitude - 1.7 , Jupiter shines much fainter than Venus but brighter than any star . The two brightest planets appearing near each other make an unbeatable combination , at least until the crescent Moon joins the pair on the morning of December 29 . Jupiter lies in Libra when the month begins , but it shifts into Scorpius shortly after midmonth . By the end of December , it appears near a trio of stars north of 1st-magnitude Antares , the brightest star in Scorpius . This trio goes by the name " the crown of the Scorpion . " Jupiter is n't much to see through a telescope now . It lies too low in the sky , behind too much of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet and nearby Venus are a joy to watch with the naked eye as twilight brightens into daylight each morning . See how long you can follow them after day breaks . Mercury and Pluto ca n't be seen this month . Mercury is in superior conjunction , behind the Sun as seen from Earth , on December 13/14 . Pluto had its conjunction in November , but it 's still too near our line of sight to the Sun to be visible . It will return to the predawn sky in January . ALL EYES ON THE GEMINIDS Even though balmy weather draws many more people to watch the Perseids in August , the Geminid meteor shower in mid-December has been providing as good a show for at least the last two decades . That 's the good news for meteor observers this month . The bad news is that this year the shower occurs just four days before Full Moon , so bright moonlight will do its best to drown out the meteors . To see the most Geminids , probably about 60 per hour , observe from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon sets but before twilight begins . That gives you nearly two hours of complete darkness , in which to drink in the shower . Geminid meteors tend to be bright , with two-thirds appearing white , one-quarter yellow , and the rest blue , green , orange , or red . And they smash into Earth 's atmosphere at moderate speeds ( for meteors ) of about 22 miles per second . For most observers , viewing the Geminids means dealing with cold weather . Here are a few tips : Orient the vehicle that brought you to the dark-sky site ( or any structure that may be available there ) so you can observe in the lee of the wind . If you own a pickup truck , face the cab into the wind to provide a windbreak and recline on a low lawn chair in the bed of the truck as you watch the sky . Wear several layers of clothes against the cold , but do n't get so snuggled-up that you doze off for a long winter 's nap . If you tend to fall asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a pair of binoculars handy for observing the occasional luminous trail left by a meteor . Finally , a thermos of coffee , tea , or hot soup will help ward off the chill and a few candy bars or cookies will keep your energy level up . A HOLIDAY ASTEROID As a year-end holiday gift , the brightest asteroid appears opposite the Sun in our sky on the night of December 24/25 . Vesta then lies in the club of Orion , just south of Gemini 's feet , placing it high in the sky around midnight . If you just received a telescope or binoculars as a gift , finding and following Vesta for a few weeks offers a good way to acquire skills you 'll use again and again . The most fun , though , could be spotting Vesta with your naked eye . From a clear , dark observing site , many observers can see stars approaching 7th magnitude . This means spotting a 6.3-magnitude asteroid should n't be the challenge of your observing career . To do so , use the finder chart or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown for 11 p.m . EST , 10 p.m .

While seated in a recliner or chaise longue , gaze at Vesta 's location in Orion 's club . if you do n't see Vesta on your first night out , do n't despair . With perseverance and a dark , steady night , you can find this asteroid with just your eyes . A STUNNING GATHERING IN THE MORNING Jupiter joins Venus in the predawn sky late this month . Venus rises more than three hours before the Sun and Jupiter follows about an hour later . By an hour before sunrise , both stand prominently above the southeastern horizon . If you receive a new telescope as a holiday gift , Venus and Jupiter will make tempting targets to get your observing started . Venus appears as a thick crescent in the eyepiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright moons . The big unknown with Jupiter is whether any evidence will remain of he dark clouds created when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashed into Jupiter last July . Probably the most visually exciting event of the month comes on the morning of December 29 , when a very old Moon joins Venus and Jupiter low in the predawn sky . It seems appropriate to experience this scene in solitude during the peaceful last hour before a winter 's sunrise . After all , that 's part of what amateur astronomy is all about . But sharing your love of the sky is part of it too . So try persuading your family to get up a bit early to see this rare grouping with you . The gathering of the three brightest objects in the night sky also presents a magnificent photo opportunity . All you need to capture the scene is a tripod-mounted SLR camera . Set its lens near the smallest f/number possible and focus on infinity . To really set the photo apart , try to frame the shot with a church steeple or some other impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , so much the better . Use fast film ( 400 ASA or faster ) and a broad range of exposures , say 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 seconds . One of those should capture the scene perfectly  --  and give you a unique photo to use on next year 's holiday card . VENUS SHINES BRILLIANTLY Venus will knock your dark-adapted socks off all month , but never more so than on the morning of December 9 . That 's when the planet attains greatest brilliancy for this morning apparition , shining at an impressive magnitude of - 4.7 . But extreme brightness is only part of what Venus offers this month . For telescopic observers , the planet provides a constantly changing appearance as its phase waxes and diameter shrinks . On the 1st , Venus appears a whopping 46 " across but just 19 percent illuminated . At greatest brilliancy on the 9th , the planet is 40 " in apparent diameter and shows a 27-percent-lit crescent . And by the end of the month , Venus measures 29 " across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORTH One of the best comets of 1994 , Comet Borrelly , comes closest to Earth in early December . At a distance of 57 million miles , this dirty snowball then glows at 8th magnitude , a level it maintains for most of December as it climbs forth from Lynx into Ursa Major . ( Positions in the finder chart and table are given for 11 p.m . EST , 10 p.m . CST , 9 p.m . MST , and 8 p.m . PST. chart &; table omitted ) Because Sky Almanac in October and November talked about how and where to observe Borrelly , this month we 'll concentrate on photographing the comet . And since it passes south and west of the Big Dipper , a wide-angle lens will let you capture Borrelly as it nears the sky 's most easily recognized asterism . To take the photos , choose an SLR camera loaded with moderately fast film ( around 400 ASA should work well ) . Then stop down the aperture by two full f/number , so if the wide open speed is f/1.4 , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer exposure times , but the improvement in image quality will be worth it . Firmly attach your camera to some sort of equatorial mount or platform that allows you to automatically track the sky . For the sharpest possible photos , piggyback the camera on a well-aligned scope and guide with a medium-powered eyepiece . If you attempt a series of photographs capturing Borrelly as it passes through Ursa Major , try to orient the Big Dipper the same way relative to the edge of the frame . By viewing all the slides in rapid succession , you then can see a kind of motion picture of the event . SATURN 'S MOONS IN ECLIPSE Approximately every 15 years ( roughly half of Saturn 's 29.5-year orbital period ) , both Earth and the Sun pass through the plane of Saturn 's rings . The rings then appear edge-on or unlit , respectively , and disappear from view for a little while . The next ring-plane crossings occur in 1995 . Because the orbits of Saturn 's satellites lie nearly in the plane of the rings , this is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind the planet and through the planet 's shadow . For more than a year before and after ring-plane crossing , Saturn eclipses some of its satellites . As you might surmise , eclipses happen most often around ring-plane crossings and trail off from there . December features 11 events involving Dione and Rhea , with six visible from all or part of North America . With Saturn now sinking rapidly in the southwestern sky after sunset , this will be the last good opportunity until May to see one of these eclipses . During an eclipse , Saturn blocks all the light that would normally reach the satellite . Thus the only part of an eclipse worth viewing is when the satellite either enters Saturn 's shadow or reemerges into sunlight . December features only re-emergences because the eclipses begin while the satellites lie behind the planet from our view . The re-emergences last anywhere from 150 to 400 seconds . The table shows when these events occur. table omitted Each of this month 's events occurs between 5 " and 7 " northeast of Saturn 's limb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optics in your telescope are scrupulously clean to minimize scattered light . Dione glows at around 11th magnitude when it comes out of eclipse , so it will be hard to see . Observing those re-emergences will require excellent seeing , at least an 8-inch telescope , and a practiced eye . The seven Rhea events will be a little easier to see because Rhea is 0.7 magnitude brighter and a bit farther from Saturn than Dione . Under good observing conditions , you should be able to glimpse Rhea re-emerging with a 6-inch scope . ASTEROID FLORA GLIDES THROUGH THE HYADES Although Vesta is easily the brightest asteroid in December ( see page 57 ) , 8 Flora certainly merits your attention . During the second half of the month , Flora passes through the Hyades cluster , the arrowhead-shaped asterism that forms the face of Taurus , the Bull . Flora reaches opposition on December 4/5 , when the asteroid glows at magnitude 8.0 . But the favorable geometry of Earth 's and Flora 's orbits keeps the 95-mile-diameter minor planet brighter than 9th magnitude all month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or table of coordinates at left ( positions are shown for 11 p.m . EST , 10 p.m . CST , 9 p.m . MST , and 8 p.m . PST ) . chart &; table omitted THE STARRY SKY One of the most ancient constellations , Taurus , the Bull , appears prominent in the winter sky . This is one of the earliest named star groups because it once marked an important location in the sky . From about 4000 to 1700 B.C. , the Sun resided in Taurus at the vernal equinox , the first day of spring . As Steven L. Beyer points out in his book The Star Guide , the bull was " a symbol of the vitality of spring . " In Greek mythology , the bull 's legendary vitality expressed itself in other ways . The bull is identified with the king of the gods , Zeus , whose amorous adventures included swimming through the sea in the form of a bull with the beautiful maiden Europa on his back . Taurus is easy to identify by an asterism , a recognizable pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouping of stars represents the bull 's face . The brightest star in the asterism , and in all of Taurus , is orangish Aldebaran , which marks the bull 's fiery eye . The Hyades forms an open star cluster , a collection of stars held together loosely by gravity , one of six fairly bright open clusters in Taurus . An open cluster 's stars are born from a single cloud of gas and dust in space , and for a time these stars are like children who stay within their own family circle . An open star cluster ultimately falls apart , however , with its member stars going their separate ways because of gravitational interactions between cluster members and the pull of the Galaxy at large . The fainter open clusters in Taurus include NGC 1647 , NGC 1746 , NGC 1807 , and NGC 1817 . Some open star clusters can be seen with the naked eye . One is the famous Pleiades , or Seven Sisters , which represents the shoulder of the bull . The Pleiades looks like a tiny misty dipper of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binoculars or a rich-field telescope also reveal the V-shaped Hyades as a multitude of glittering stars . The bright star Aldebaran is a foreground object lying some 80 light-years closer than the 150-light-year-distant Hyades cluster . Like all open clusters , the Hyades is relatively young . Astronomers estimate it to be about 650 million years old , in contrast to the **32;236;TOOLONG Sun . Another object in Taurus represents an even earlier phase of a star 's life . T Tauri  --  a variable star that ranges from 8th to 13th magnitude and lies about 5deg northwest of Aldebaran  --  is the prototype for a class of stars thought to be so young that they are still collapsing gravitationally . These stars , which vary erratically in brightness , are probably less than a million years old . But as birth and death both are part of life , so they co-exist within the boundaries of the constellation Taurus . A 6-to 8-inch telescope reveals a fairly bright oval patch in this constellation , known as the Crab Nebula ( M1 ) . This is the remnant of a supernova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its life , witnessed by Chinese astronomers in 1054 . ( See " Inside the Crab Nebula , " page 42 , for the latest images of this supernova remnant . ) MARS GROWS LARGE IN THE EYEPIECE Now just two months away from its opposition , Mars grows rapidly in apparent size during December . Through a telescope , the Red Plant swells by more than a quarter , from 8.6 " to 11.0 " across , crossing the 10 " threshold at which most backyard observers can begin to see subtle details on the surface of Mars . Those last four words  --  " the surface of Mars "  --  might seem relatively innocuous , but they speak volumes . Why ? Because of all the planets , only Mars has surface we can easily observe from Earth . Sure , it 's technically true that we can observe the cratered surface of Mercury and the iceball that is Pluto , but Mars is the only planet that has a surface on which appreciable detail can be seen in a backyard telescope . Features visible on Mars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although these have been glimpsed by experienced observers using large telescopes under perfect conditions . No , what we see are albedo features , either regions where the material on the planet 's surface reflects light well and thus appears bright pink , or mostly absorbs light and appears dark gray or dark green because of the contrast with the pink areas . The light albedo features are mostly sandy areas , and the dark areas are those that the strong winds of Mars have scoured clean of sand , revealing the darker , rougher surface beneath . What makes observing Mars so fascinating is that the winds keep moving the sand around a bit , so the features are ever changing . The winds do n't control all the features , however . The polar caps  --  thin layers of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide  --  rank as the most striking features on the disk of Mars because they reflect the Sun 's light almost perfectly . It 's now spring in the northern hemisphere of Mars , and the north polar regions tilt toward us . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the north polar cap shrink steadily as the Martian seasons march on .
