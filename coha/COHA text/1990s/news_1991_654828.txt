<p> WHEN an earthquake shook northwestern Iran last June , Iranian leaders argued at length about whether they should accept the assistance offered by Western countries . <p> President Hashemi Rafsanjani 's eventual decision to welcome relief organizations was met in the Iranian press with a spate of anti-European and anti-American editorials . <p> Less than a year later in early April , when the flow of Iraqi Kurdish refugees began pouring into Iran , Mr. Rafsanjani immediately ordered his minister of foreign affairs to seek international help . Not a single editorialist criticized his decision . Only a handful of parliamentary deputies have so far dared to say that Iran should deal with the refugee problem without international help . <p> Such moves exemplify Iran 's recent rapid evolution . Western observers , diplomats , and Iranian citizens share the same view : Iranian society under Rafsanjani is on the move . It is an evolution with consequences for both Iran 's foreign and domestic policies . <p> Abroad , Iran is step by step breaking its international political isolation . At home , the Islamic regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens who in the past would have supported a monarchy . <p> " During the first 10 years of the Islamic era , Rafsanjani proved to be a shrewd politician , " says an Iranian businessmen . " Over the past two years he has emerged as a statesman . He is the only man capable of putting this country back on the track . " <p> Rafsanjani 's apparent strategy is to position himself as a man trying to unify the Iranian people after years of turmoil and divisions . In his speeches he insists on traditional Islamic values , but also praises Iran 's national past , which attracts middle class support . <p> On April 20 , Rafsanjani became the first post-revolutionary leader to make an official visit to the Persepolis ruins near the southern city of Shiraz . His recognition of Iran 's past runs counter to some clerics who , after the revolution had called for destruction of the historic site . On this vestige of the Achaemenian Empire , Rafsanjani asked his countrymen " to reinforce their national dignity , " a call with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his approach , Rafsanjani has taken a series of measures to make Iran more attractive to foreigners , particularly to potential investors . <p> This was immediately evident during a reporter 's first trip to Tehran in three years . On arriving at the airport , the rapidity of custom formalities is striking : Officers who used to search for alcohol or magazines in Western travellers suitcases now refrain . <p> Laws on monetary exchange have been done away with as well . Travelers entering and leaving the country are no longer asked to fill out forms stating the amount of currency they carry and are free to change money wherever they want . The same regulations apply to Iranians . <p> Inside the city , roadblocks once manned by revolutionary committees have disappeared replaced by regular policemen . Municipal workers have also in past months scrubbed the frontages of official buildings with the result that most anti-Western slogans and caricatures have disappeared . Thousands of small trees have been planted along Tehran 's main avenues . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs building , for example , has been revamped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festive air . <p> " At rather low cost , Rafsanjani wants to show his people and the rest of the world that things here are changing , " says a Western diplomat . <p> Rafsanjani seems eager to make people forget the dark years of war . The strict Islamic dress code remains applicable , but its enforcement is less stringent . Men appear regularly in suits and ties . <p> In days following the April 16 end of the Ramadan holy season , a softening in the dress rules for women was also apparent : some could be seen wearing makeup , and complying with rules that their head and face be covered only by placing a symbolic piece of fabric on their hair . <p> Three days later a senior ayatollah complained in a speech of " the problem of women who do n't abide by the code of dressing is getting worse by the day . " The remarks were followed by the April 23 announcement by the Islamic Republic News Agency that police had clamped down on women violating the code . Most of those arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in uptown Tehran do n't realize that they live in an Islamic and prudish country , " says a diplomat who has spent years in Iran . " Whenever they feel a relaxation in the rules , they do go too far . " <p> Then there is Iranian television . Three years ago soap operas portrayed traditional chador-clad women married to bearded men . The characters of that period sat on the floor in the traditional Iranian way and conversations centered on religious matters . <p> In a recent broadcast , however , a woman character 's head was uncovered except for a veil over her hair , and her young daughter sometimes appeared bare headed . The entire family made regular use of tables and chairs . <p> Iranian TV has also begun airing Japanese movies showing unveiled women . But this new step forward has triggered a wave of protests by several deputies in the parliament . <p> Despite such changes , and a feeling of new optimism , the mood is tempered by the city 's high cost of living . <p> Inflation is rampant . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago now sells for 10 times that amount . Civil servants are hardest hit . The government recently raised the average monthly salary by 20,000 rials to 110,000 rials . <p> Western commercial attaches say the inflation has come about because of the government 's decision to move slowly from a state- subsidized economy to a free-market system . The Iranian government also wants to make the rial fully convertible to other currencies and has moved to gradually devalue it . <p> " The Iranian are going through hard days , but their government policy is healthy and in a few months the inflation should slow down , " says a Western banker . " The economy will then be ready for recovery . "
