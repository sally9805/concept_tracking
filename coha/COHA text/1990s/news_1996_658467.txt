<p> The Internet 's presence in American culture and business continues to spread like kudzu . And American publishers by necessity are beginning to understand this new medium 's repercussions more quickly than other industries . <p> Worried that sales on the Internet from a home or office computer will threaten the livelihood of booksellers and thus their own businesses , publishers are cautiously testing Internet sales . No one wants to miss an opportunity , but no one wants to be replaced by the new technologies - or , in Internet jargon , " disintermediated . " <p> Booksellers ' concern revolves around the potential for publishers to deal directly with consumers and the media on the Internet , says Larry Daniels , director of information technologies for the National Association of College Stores in Oberlin , Ohio . The phenomenon could mean the elimination of middlemen such as bookstores , he says . <p> " There is also the potential for publishers to be ' disintermediated , ' " Mr. Daniels adds , noting that computer-literate writers can already publish and distribute their own works on-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Internet has encouraged the development of a new set of electronic middlemen . <p> Steve Potash , president of OverDrive Systems , an electronic book publisher in Cleveland , is one of many techies developing avenues for sales of books on the Internet . He describes his electronic book products , sold on the OverDrive Electronic Book Aisle ( www.bookaisle.com ) , as computer software with all the features of physical books . <p> OverDrive has " distribution " contracts with many large publishing houses , including Time Warner Electronic Publications , McGraw Hill , and Simon and Schuster . <p> " If a user downloads an entire book , " Mr Potash says , " he 's getting electronic book software with software features . " Any index the book might have , for instance , will appear as a menu . " <p> " You can search a book cover to cover on-line to find out if it has anything of interest before you purchase the book , " Potash says . " You can search a cookbook for recipes and download the one you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic and buy only the chapters you need . " <p> Electronic publishing has been a particularly successful way to distribute encyclopedias , computer books , how-to books , and technical books that depend on current data , Potash says . <p> But publishing houses are skeptical of electronic book-publishing capabilities . They remain uncertain about the Internet 's future in the sale of physical books . At present , on-line book sales total less that 1 percent of overall book sales . <p> Jordan Gold , vice president and publisher of MacMillan On-Line , considers the Internet a largely experimental tool . <p> " The Internet is a great place to get information about our books , " Mr. Gold says . MacMillan sells a few books electronically , and offers Web-site visitors an opportunity to buy books through the mail . But Gold does not consider the Internet a primary avenue for sales . <p> " Our survey results show that most people would rather buy from bookstores , " he says . <p> Booksellers are equally tentative about going on-line . " We 're looking into what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of corporate communications for Barnes and Noble . " We 'll probably have something in the next year . " <p> As the mainstream publishing industry hesitates on the Internet 's sales possibilities , smaller retail companies are sprouting up all over the information superhighway . These companies do not share the publishing industry 's squeamishness about using the Internet as a sales medium . <p> Dial-A-Book , the idea of former Ziff-Davis executive Stanley Greenfield , attempts to remedy one of the primary flaws in on-line sales : the inability of potential customers to browse the books . <p> " People like to browse the books before they buy , " Mr. Greenfield says . " You can read a book review , but it does n't give you a sense of the level at which the book was written . " <p> Dial-A-Book gives Internet users the opportunity to browse the first chapters of more than 450 books . The company does not build traffic for its own page on the World Wide Web . Instead , it has a list of clients including CNN , ESPN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dial-A-Book pages to sell specific books . <p> Uniting publishing houses , booksellers , special interest groups , and consumers on the Internet , Dial-A-Book may represent a model for future internet industries . But Greenfield is waiting for the reading public to catch up . <p> " Up to now , we have n't sold many books , " he says , suggesting that consumers find the service too new , or alien , or are still afraid to enter their credit card numbers on-line . <p> Perhaps the only Internet bookseller with cause for immediate optimism is Jeff Bezos , president and founder of Amazon.com Books ( www.amazon.com ) , the leading bookstore on the Internet . <p> " We are using the medium to do what you could n't do in the physical world , " Mr. Bezos says . " The largest physical bookstore in the world carries 170,000 titles . Our on-line catalogue has 1.1 million titles . " The catalogue , he claims , would be the size of seven New York City phone books . <p> Once a five-person company based in Bezos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for the past 12 months . It became a hot venture-capital prospect when it won an investment from the investment firm Kleiner , Perkins , Caufield &; Byers , which specializes in high-tech companies . <p> " The main thing that holds other sites back is that they 're not offering a value proposition return for a definite level of inconvenience , " Bezos says . Compensating for the inconvenience of server failures and computer glitches , Amazon.com offers more titles and specialized books than any other single bookstore in the world . <p> But not even Bezos suggests that on-line sales will replace more traditional bookselling methods . <p> " We are not really competing with physical bookstores , " Bezos says . " The key is that people like to get out of their houses . I still go to physical bookstores , and I 'm not going to stop . I even buy books there . I like the tactile experience . " <p> Common Interests Prevail On Line <p> If you are a book lover , the internet can supplement your regular shopping routine . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized topics , if on-line shopping is going to work for you . <p> The industry leader , Amazon.com , succeeds because of its enormous catalogue . Gathering titles from 12 national wholesalers and 20,000 independent publishers , Jeff Bezos 's company offers books in specialized categories that no major physical bookstores will carry . <p> There are ways in which the " net takes us back centuries to communities based on common interests , " says Amy Cook , manager of new media at Random House . " Web users are interested in information gathering . The books are slightly more practical and academic . " For the most part , they are not mass-market books . <p> In addition to prohibitive on-line fees and shipping and handling charges , general-interest customers are still hesitant to leave their credit card numbers on-line . As a percent of total US book sales , Internet sales are well under 1 percent , Bezos says . <p> And until readers grow accustomed to reading from a computer screen and demand more information in this format , electronic books will only be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure physical bookstores to hone in on what Lisa Herling of Barnes and Noble says they do best anyway : provide " a wide variety of books with good customer service and a comfortable setting .
