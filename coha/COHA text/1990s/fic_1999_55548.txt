In the summer of 1967 , Nathan Bogmore never woke up before eleven o clock . He was fourteen years old , and he slept with more intensity than he did anything else . Having just left the warm , rumpled mattress in the empty back room of their cottage , he stood at the front door in his pajamas , squinting into the day , wishing he could simply get back under the sheets and forget everything . <p> He heard his father moving around in the temporary studio he had made in the garage , and in the direction of the main house , down the road a quarter mile , there was the sound of drumming as the dancers did their warm-ups on the lawn . His mother was painting in her studio at the smaller cottage . His sister , a girl two years his junior who was named Genevieve Bogmore on her birth certificate , but called Jimmy by family and friends , was either dancing with the troupe on the enormous lawn at the main house or helping Mack water the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . <p> So much creativity going on around him only made it harder for Nathan to resist the urge to give up and go back to bed . It took a powerful effort to bust into the day at that late hour , and he was n't sure he wanted to go to all the trouble . He looked down at his feet . Then he looked out into the woods directly across from the porch and saw a bunch of trees . What saved him , what saved him every time , was hunger . So he turned around , let the screen door slam shut behind him , and went into the kitchen to find some breakfast . <p> The school year had gone badly for Nathan , and even though it was summer vacation , he should have been up hours earlier studying his French . He 'd managed to pass math and English , but he had failed French . To go on to the second level , he had to take summer school . The session ran for eight weeks in July and August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reduced to weekend trips . All of that was discussed and resolved after the letter had arrived from the principal . No wanderings through New England , no week-long stays at the Jersey shore . Because of Nathan , they were going to have to endure the whole stretch of summer vacation right there in humid Philadelphia . <p> It was finalized . The box on the letter was checked , and Nathan was enrolled in French camp at Temple University . He would get there on his own , take the bus to the Broad Street subway and the subway to the Temple stop . He would not pay attention to the smell of urine in the underground tunnel or the trash whipping along the dusty street in the hot wind . He would simply go to class and then come home . It would be a long and boring summer , but in Nathan 's mind it was a just punishment for his reckless disregard of requirements . The penance pleased him . It matched in its dullness the level of excitement he had felt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lifted him above the stupid entanglements of his classes . <p> But . And in the Bogmore family , the but was everything . Nothing was secure against the but . It could wedge into any resolution and blow it apart . <p> The but in this case was Phyllis . She invited the entire family to stay in the cottage on Mack 's summer place in Connecticut . There was a studio in a smaller cottage for Judy , Nathan 's mother , to paint in , and a very suitable garage space where Paul , Nathan 's father , could have a kiln and a potter 's wheel . All in exchange for a few hours every morning helping Mack plant some trees . <p> Judy had been delighted . She told Phyllis they would love to do it , and she 'd call back the next day with a definite answer . That evening at dinner she related the proposal to the rest of the family . Already saved from a summer of hell , his mother was as giddy as a little girl . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one to destroy her plans . <p> " I failed French , remember ? Summer school ? " <p> " Nathan , do n't be sarcastic " his father said . <p> " Oh shit " his mother said . " I had forgotten . You 're sure you failed French ? The grades are n't in yet , are they ? Maybe you managed to squeak through . " <p> Nathan went to the desk and pulled out the letter the principal had mailed to them the week before . " It says it right here . I failed . " <p> His mother was ladling soup into bowls . That was the period of the one-pot meals . So she could have a longer day in the studio , she cooked chicken , beans , and vegetables on the weekend and made soup from it all week long , varying the ingredients so it would n't get boring . By the end of the week , everything was so mushy she just threw it all into the blender and Friday 's soup was a brown puree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Nathan took the trouble to do because he liked food to be distinct . <p> " Would n't it be wonderful if Mack and Phyllis had a place in France ? " his mother asked . " Then it would solve everything . You 're having trouble because you do n't know what the language sounds like . What you need is to be surrounded by French . Then you 'd just fall into it , automatically . " <p> " Automatically , " Jimmy mimicked . His beautiful sister thrust out her nonexistent hips and gave him a sultry glance . <p> " If Mack and Phyllis had a place in France , we would have to row across the Atlantic in a bathtub . That 's about all we could afford " his father said , slapping his mother on the rear end . She told him to leave her alone and go do something useful . To Jimmy , she said , " Go play the piano , why do n't you . " Then , with music filling the kitchen , she made Nathan sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to make it work . Because a summer in the country , and you can bet any amount of money that Mack and Phyllis 's place is really exquisite because I know them , they never do anything halfway , is healthier for you children than a summer cooped up in a hot , dirty city . Believe me . " Nathan had looked at her silently . " Cooped up " would n't have been the words he would have used to describe it . He saw it as release , a summer of being released into the arteries of the city , a summer of independence . <p> They went . Judy wrote a letter to the principal unenrolling Nathan in French camp . She put an ad in the paper in Danbury , Connecticut , for a French tutor , and the second day after they arrived at the compound that sat at the end of a dirt road , hidden in a lush and tangled forest , Mlle. Tanguy puttered down the long driveway that linked their cottage to the main house , bumping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called a Citroen . <p> " Bonjour , Nathan , comment vas-tu ? Tu vas bien ? " She spoke to him immediately , getting right to business , not even waiting to shut the rusted door on her car . She leaned into the back seat , brought out paper , books , and a pencil case , and straightened up and looked towards the cottage . He followed her inside , and that whole first lesson he stared at her weathered face as her light , cheerful voice subdued whatever resistance he might have had . " Comment t'appelles-tu ? Tu es Nathan ? " <p> " Oui , " he said lamely and followed her around the cottage as she stuck labels on all of their furniture . On the door to his parents room it said , " le pere , la mere . " On the door to Jimmy 's room it said , " la soeur . " On his door it said , " le frere . " <p> For the next week , as he swam and ate and walked the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occupied with French . Once he managed to get out of bed , he would find himself making the effort . Le bateau was the word he thought of as he and Jimmy pushed the rowboat into the shiny black pond that sat at the bottom of the enormous lawn , and when Jimmy was at the oars and it drifted too close to the willows , forcing them to duck under the trailing leaves , he thought , l'arbre . When they entered the darkness underneath the trees , where insects hung in clouds , and frogs they could n't see plopped into the murky water , all that circled around in his mind was l'eau . And when Jimmy would hold the boat still , jamming her oar into the soft mud so they would have to stay there and endure the mosquitoes , he glared at her and thought , la soeur . Even though the clammy feeling of the place made his hands sweat , he thought , il est midi . Because he did n't know how to add qualities , his mind lost its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral state , in its perfect beingness . Of course there was the time he got so angry at her , he kicked the oar out of her hand . It flew up and splattered them both with mud . That gave them the idea . The next time , they rowed under the willows purposely and used the oar like a shovel to scoop up the soft mud which la soeur patted on her face and legs and arms until she was covered . Nathan did n't like touching the mud so he painted his face , and that was all . Then they rowed back to the dock and lay down in the sun to let it dry . But it did n't dry brown . It dried blue and smelly . <p> " Have n't you been smelling something ? " Jimmy asked , suddenly sitting upright . <p> " You " he answered . " La sewer . " He started to laugh . " La sewer ! " <p> She dove into the water , staying under until the far side of the pond , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long , brown hair shiny with wetness . He dove in after her because the smell was pretty terrible and he had been thinking about all of the frog poop that must have settled into the very mud he 'd patted on his cheeks . <p> " La sewer ! " he shouted . " La sewer ! La sewer ! " He tried to make her angry , but she only said in her superior tone , " Oh , shut up . You 're just a baby . " <p> " I 'm a garcon , " he shouted , kicking water into her face . <p> But she was a better swimmer than he was , and no amount of splashing would make her falter . She was also a better diver . And she could play the piano and improvise with the dancers in the troupe who were also in residence and , like his parents , planted trees in the morning and lived like guests on the estate the rest of the day . They loved Jimmy and predicted a career for her in modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger , she had traveled far ahead of him . She had figured out all the connections so that she could move from one accomplishment to another , never even looking like she was working very hard at anything . She had whole strings of connections while he went from one simple noun to another , doomed to the dullness of single words . <p> Dinners at the main house were formal . First there were cocktails in the living room . The evening sun ( le soleil ) hit the bottles of booze like a dagger , making them glisten at the center of the room . Nathan and Jimmy were each served a small glass of sweet sherry . <p> Jimmy took hers into the living room and drank it in little sips as she played the piano . All she played , all that summer , was Beethoven 's " Fur Elise . " She 'd been able to get it to sound pretty good on their out-of-tune upright at home , but on the grand piano in the dining room of the big house on Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nathan was amazed every time he heard it . How could it be that simply following a bunch of notes she could make him have such feelings ? It was as though Beethoven were talking to him , telling him something he alone needed to hear . So he listened . He listened without appearing to listen . The exasperating thing was that Jimmy liked to play when there was an audience . Her eyes would get a glazed-over look , and she 'd sway in and out , her delicate white hands flying over the keys like moths . You almost did n't see them . <p> Nathan stayed in the living room , studying the design in the Oriental carpet , trying to match it to the design on the sofa . Or he smelled the odor of old fires which wafted out of the enormous fireplace , and tried to balance it with the bits of conversation , or the fan moving above their heads , its black blades whipping the air into a steamy froth . La conversation . He could n't figure out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if it did n't , he wanted to know why they bothered . For instance , what was the point of playing music and making someone feel out of control ? Nathan walked from the bowl of black olives to the bowl of green olives , to the tray of cheese and crackers , to the bowls of baby corn and tiny gherkins , thinking his thoughts and taking a sample at each stop . <p> " And how are your French lessons going ? " Mack slapped him so soundly between the shoulders , he almost spit out the olive pits he had been storing in his mouth and absently exploring with the tip of his tongue . <p> " Fine , " he said . <p> " Can you say that in French ? " <p> " Bien . " <p> " Good boy ! Well , keep it up ! You never know when a foreign language will come in handy . Did I ever tell you I was stationed near Paris at the end of the war ? " <p> " Did you kill anyone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned close a couple of times . You enjoying those olives ? Now , if it were up to you , which ones do you think are best , the black or the green ? Tell me your honest opinion " <p> Mack leaned in close to him as though he really wanted to know , and gazing up into his light blue eyes , Nathan saw a flicker of something , a shadow passing where a shadow should n't have passed because the man 's eyes were so blue and filled with light . Yet something dark had opened up inside them and then closed just as suddenly . There on the rosy , liver-spotted face , something in the eyes , something he should n't have seen . And Mack knew that he 'd seen it . Le secret . Nathan did n't even try to guess what it was . <p> Estella rang the dinner bell , and they filed into the dining room . Jimmy got up from the piano and joined him at the table . They were placed together between Erik , the drummer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts with petticoats underneath them . She also wore mostly unbuttoned blouses and was haphazard about the way she leaned over . For Nathan , meals were a series of hurried glances down the ravine between her breasts . <p> " Lovely , lovely , lovely , " Phyllis sang out , clapping her hands . " The table looks lovely , Estella ! " <p> " Thank you , ma'am , ' Estella said as she came in with a platter of roasted chicken . <p> " And it smells heavenly . And Jimmy , your playing sounds more wonderful every day . Are n't we lucky mortals ? I 'm so glad we 're all here together , working and making art , and I feel so lucky to have Mack , and Mack is so lucky to have money . " She pouted a little and asked , " You do n't mind my saying that , do you , sweetheart ? " <p> Mack answered in a voice made gravely by years of smoking . " I feel that it is my special role as a businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices you artists make create a life worth living for the rest of us . You show us beauty , you show us true feeling . And I 'm happy to support the arts in whatever small way I can . " <p> " Is n't he a wonderful man ? " Phyllis asked the table . " I 'm so glad I married you . " <p> " She only married me for my money , ' Mack said . <p> " I did , sweetheart , I did . And then I fell head-over-heels . " <p> " Let 's have a toast to Mack and Phyllis , who made it possible for all of us to be together . " Le pere said that . He took it upon himself to be master of ceremonies , the liaison between the nobility and peasants . <p> " As long as you plant those trees ! " Mack cried out . <p> " And make art and make dances , ' Phyllis added . Then she said , " We are so lucky , all of us , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious food , Estella . " <p> " Thank you , ma'am . " <p> She was stopping between each of them , holding the heavy platter of chicken with one hand and serving with the other . Her skin against her crisply starched uniform looked very brown , and her stooped posture , as she bent down between each person , seemed to carry in it the hardships of other times and places . By the time she came between Nathan and Molly , her hand was so unsteady the platter was shaking . Nathan stated his choices quickly so she could move on . That was how he , the one who existed in a world of simple nouns , tried to help her out . But then he noticed that the shaking stopped when she was between Jimmy and Erik , and he saw that Jimmy had put her own hand under the platter to give Estella 's hand a rest . She did n't say anything , and Estella did n't say anything , either , and when she moved on to serve the next person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only male in the dance troupe , had straight black hair and an overly serious expression . He wore black tights and a black T-shirt whether they were rehearsing or not , and he seemed particularly solicitous of Jimmy , which made Nathan jealous because Molly ignored him except to lean over and let him gaze down her cleavage . <p> " How are the trees coming along , Mack ? " Erik asked across the table . " Are we on schedule ? " <p> " A bit behind , " Mack said . " Tomorrow , we 're going to have to start at six o'clock . " Nathan looked up and saw the butterfly wing close suddenly in Mack 's eye . " We could use a strong kid like you , Nathan . Can you pull him out of bed , Paul ? He could handle the water truck . Maybe Jimmy could help Estella in the kitchen . " <p> " Ca n't I plant trees , too ? I 'm stronger than Nathan . " <p> " Can you make use of her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platter of rice . <p> " Sure thing , boss . You get here at six o'clock when your brother goes out with the other folks , and I 'll put you to work . " She smiled at Jimmy , her white teeth shining in the darkness of her face . <p> Mack was planting Russian olives around the borders of his two hundred acres . It was a small ornamental tree with tiny oval leaves . Barbed wire fencing would have been faster and cheaper , but Mack grew up on a huge ranch in the West , and he wanted the illusion of infinite space , but for practical reasons needed to know where his boundaries were . The tree planting was slow work so Phyllis , Mack 's third wife , and formerly an unemployed dancer , conceived the plan of inviting her friends from New York City . She thought of Paul and Judy in Philadelphia when she realized that the smallest cottage would make an ideal studio for a painter and that the garage of the larger cottage would be adequate for Paul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main house , and she gave the cottages to the Bogmores . <p> The next morning , Nathan was up at five o'clock with everyone else . He put on a grumpy act because he assumed it would be expected , but really , he was pleased to be awake when the sky was just getting light and the woods behind the cottage were full of singing birds . He did what he was supposed to do  --  he got dressed and ate a bowl of cereal  --  secretly watching himself go through the routine . <p> Le pere was full of energy , la mere was quiet , la soeur kept bumping into him as they walked down the road to the main house . Nathan did n't bump her back . There was n't any need to engage with any of them . Everything around him was shouting , the grass , the sky , the black-eyed Susans growing at the side of the road , and he looked at each thing and , in his mind , told it to shut up . Even the birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was awake , and it was clear that the world could be molded and controlled . The birds chirped in a sedate manner now , the wildflowers were n't so brazen . Les oiseaux , la fleur , le ciel . <p> Jimmy went into the big house , the screen door snapping shut behind her . Nathan followed his parents into the barn , where the dancers were already loading the truck with trees . The Russian olives were small and easy to lift , and they 'd swing them up to the bed of the truck , standing them on their burlap-wrapped dirt balls . They loaded twenty-five trees , and then they hooked up the wagon for the water drum . <p> The screen door snapped again , and Mack came out of the house in work clothes and a cowboy hat . He slapped Nathan on the shoulder blades and then showed him how to fill the empty drum from the large tank on the truck . Water was going to be Nathan 's responsibility . When the drum was empty , he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode up front with Mack , and everyone else walked . The truck went the same pace that they did , smashing down weeds and saplings as it crossed the field and climbed the hill to the spot where they had finished the day before . <p> La mere was lagging behind , talking to Molly , but then she caught up with Nathan . " Is n't it glorious ? " <p> Phyllis always said glorious . The sky was glorious , the food was glorious , the conversation was glorious . " It 's okay " Nathan replied , wanting to lock his feelings away from her prying eyes . <p> " It has n't rained yet , ' she added . " Mack wants it to because the trees really need it . I do , too . I need the day off . " <p> " You only have to work till ten-thirty " <p> " It 's hard , though . You wait and see . " She took off her work gloves and held out her hands . " See these ? " She pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You try shoveling for a couple of hours . " <p> " I 'm not going to shovel . I 'm going to pull the water wagon . " <p> His mother did n't even acknowledge the challenging tone of his voice . She took off her canvas hat and wiped her forehead . " Even now it 's getting hot . Nathan , you did n't wear a hat . " <p> " I 'll be okay . " <p> " With the sun beating down on you , you 'll get really tired " <p> " I thought we were going to be in the woods . " <p> " Right , but there 'll be flies " <p> " I 'll be okay , ' he mumbled . <p> Part of the excitement he felt came from understanding the power of his body . He did n't get cold , and he did n't get hot . Flies did n't bother him . Shoveling , if he had to do it , would n't bother him , either , because he could stand almost anything . Had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweatshirt ? Even during their one snowstorm . <p> Molly caught up to la mere and , sending Nathan a glance , put her hand on his mother 's arm . " I 'd love to come to your studio sometime and see what you 're doing " <p> " Oh gosh , really ? I 'm not ready yet . I 'm just getting started . " <p> " What are you working on ? " <p> " Well , I thought I 'd do a series of paintings of the pond . In fact , I think I 'm just going to paint the pond all summer . " <p> Nathan could tell that Molly thought that was a stupid idea because she said " Really ? " in a way that sounded false . <p> But la mere did n't notice . " It changes all the time . In the morning if it 's sunny , it looks one way , in the evening , it 's all dark and mysterious . I saw a deer drinking at it the other evening . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay better attention . " <p> " I 've never lived in the country " la mere went on , " and everything just seems like a miracle . A raccoon , a deer , even the way the squirrels chatter at you from the trees . " <p> " Tell me something , are you enjoying it ? " <p> " Oh heavens , yes . Anything to get out of the city . " <p> " Do you think it 's fair that we should be doing this backbreaking work ? An hour or two , I 'd be happy to put in . But four and a half hours is exhausting , and frankly , our rehearsals are n't going well because everyone 's so tired . You have to be really focused for modern dance . Intention has to inform every movement , and what we 've been doing lately has just felt blurred . " <p> " I know it 's hard , but Mack 's depending on us . " <p> " I 'd be happy to do it for a short while " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful food and a whole cottage to use as a studio . " <p> " Our studio is the lawn , and it slopes " Molly said discontentedly . " You have a cottage to live in and we all have these rather small rooms and mine is right above Mack and Phyllis 's and he 's got the TV on late every night ... I do n't know if the man has insomnia or what . " <p> " Excuse me , " la mere said , " I want to catch Nathan for a minute . Can we talk again later ? " <p> " Sure , but remember , I really would love to see your pond paintings when you 're ready to show them . " <p> " Thanks . " La mere steered Nathan off to the side , right behind the tailpipe . Nathan got a lungful of smoke and coughed it out noisily . <p> " Are you all right , sweetheart ? Listen , I 've been wanting to ask you , how 's French ? " <p> " Fine . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Le frere . " <p> " Let 's see , that 's ' brother . ' Gosh , it 's been so long . Well , good , can you say something else ? " <p> " La soeur . " <p> " Oh , I know what that is . ' The sister . ' " <p> " Tres belle . " <p> " Sure , I 'm starting to remember . ' Very beautiful . ' Your sister is very beautiful , is n't she ? But you 're very handsome . Let 's see . Le garcon est ... I do n't know the word for handsome . " <p> He did n't , either . It was n't a word , even in English , he thought about much . Probably because he did n't care if he was handsome or not . Power was what he thought about . But it was n't power like strong muscles . Another kind of power . A power that lifted him above all of the petty problems of his existence , like flies and hot sun and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the atmosphere where all surfaces were smooth , and logic was the supreme order , not feelings . <p> Even though he had n't done well in math that year , he had appreciated the systems . All you had to do was set down a system , and then you could use it to answer any number of problems , and each time , if you stuck to the system , you 'd get the right answer . <p> Nathan heard Mack shift the truck into a lower gear as the hill got steeper . The back wheels slipped in the soft dirt , and a couple of the trees fell over . <p> " When 's your next lesson ? " la mere asked . <p> " She 's coming this afternoon . " <p> " Well , you pay really good attention . Just let go of English and try to melt into the French , okay ? If you resist it , it will be that much harder . " <p> " Oui , maman . " <p> " That 's my sweetheart . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday " <p> Mack parked the truck on a level spot , and le pere jumped out and opened the tailgate . Everyone took a shovel . Le pere went off with a tape measure and marked the place for each tree and then cut away the undergrowth to clear a spot for the hole . Nathan watched him , waiting for Mack to give him instructions . Soon , he heard the dry sounds of shovels scratching against the hard earth . There was n't even any dew to wet the surface . The dirt they shoveled up was a light brown in color , mixed with rock , and only when they were down a foot or more did the soil turn damp . <p> " Nathan , my boy ! First , we 're going to fill the water drum . " Mack did n't look at him , just stooped down and undid the clamps holding the wagon on the trailer . " You wheel it over to the hose . That 's a boy . See , it 's easy to push when it 's empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too heavy for you . You 're a strong boy . I 've been looking at you , I 've seen those muscles . Right ? " <p> Mack took his cowboy hat off , and under his white hair , Nathan saw the shadow in his eyes . <p> He uncoiled the hose from the bed of the truck . It was hooked to a fifty-gallon tank that he had filled at the house that morning . " See , you position it like this " Mack put the nozzle into the top of the water wagon and turned on the spigot . Water ran noisily into the empty container . " Now , the important thing is that you watch it while it 's filling because if you do n't turn the spigot off when it 's full , the water will just spill out , and we ca n't let that happen . Because when we 're out here , this is the only water we 've got , and all these little trees are depending on you . They do n't get water , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . Now , they , ll be digging holes for a while . The ground 's hard . Has n't rained in three weeks . So come over here , and I 'll show you something . All right ? Want to see something ? " <p> The kind of power Nathan dreamed of was uninvolved power . He might have admired the way Mack ordered everyone around if he had n't felt a hint of cruelty somewhere . Nathan 's power came out of a disinterested involvement , and since logic was its operative , he did n't ever have to manipulate . He followed Mack into a grove of trees . Mack said they were ash . <p> " Now , look at this , son . " Mack pointed to scratches on the bark of one of the trees , places where something had rubbed the bark down to the yellow wood underneath it . " That 's made by a buck sharpening his antlers . " <p> " How 'd you find it ? " <p> " Oh , I just happened to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rubbing his antlers . Go ahead , touch it . " <p> Nathan reached out and touched the damp scar . <p> " Is n't that something ? You stick with Mack , and you 'll see some things . A horny young buck , well . " The cowboy hat was back on his head . " Us boys are going to stick together . " In the leaf-dappled sunlight , caught with the older man between the trees , Nathan felt his hands get moist . The butterfly wings were completely open in Mack 's eyes , and Nathan knew he should n't look at them closely , even though he could tell , in a side glance , that the designs were beautiful . <p> That afternoon , he sat at the kitchen table with Mlle. Tanguy . " Le bateau , le fleuve . " He repeated after her , hearing the easy glide of the words in his mind and knowing they came out halted and sloppy . " La maison , l'homme , l'arbre . " Those last two he thought he said nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping her hands , her bracelets jingling . " Nathan , s'il te platt , un verre d'eau . " <p> He sat a moment , trying to figure it out . <p> " Une verre d'eau , s'il te platt . " <p> Suddenly , he understood , but he stood up so quickly the chair fell backwards . His face went red because Mademoiselle was laughing . " Maladroit , " she said . <p> He was n't sure what that meant , but he had a pretty good idea . He placed the glass on the table , and she lifted it eagerly to take a sip . " Delicious water . Everyone should drink eight glasses of water a day . Do you know why ? " <p> " No , Mademoiselle . " <p> " Water lubricates all the systems . It does the same thing in your body as oil does in an engine . Do you know what oil does in an engine ? " <p> " It lets all the different parts move . " <p> " That 's right . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait till you can drive , can you ? " <p> " I can wait . " <p> " Mon dieu ! A boy who is n't anxious to drive ! How very unusual ! " <p> The truth was that he had n't even thought about driving . <p> " All right , back to franfais . Now , in our first week you 've learned many nouns . It 's time for review . When I say each word I want you to repeat it after me , write it down , spelling it correctly , and then tell me what it means . " <p> They spent the whole lesson making a list , and when they were done , there were sixty-two nouns . He knew about half of them by heart . The rest he would have to study . <p> " Next week , I will give you a test . " <p> " A test ? " <p> " A test . And I expect it to be one hundred percent correct . And if it is , we will move on to verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give tests in summer school . " <p> " They most certainly do , and therefore we will have a test here . " She unzipped her pencil case and took out a freshly sharpened pencil . <p> " Mademoiselle , what is the word for suspicion ? " <p> " Suspicion ? That is an English word I do n't know . " <p> " If I am afraid that a person is trying to do something secretly , that 's a suspicion . " <p> " Ah , soupcon ! Should we add that one to the list ? You are an unusual boy , Nathan . My nephew , who is one year younger than you , ca n't wait till he can start to drive , and ' rocket ' or ' airplane ' or ' battleship ' those are the words he wants me to teach him " She wrote the time and day of their next meeting , then put her pencil back in the case and stood up , her bracelets jingling . " Good boy , study your words , drink eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He walked her to her car , noticing the way the gravel driveway made her teeter in her high heels . <p> When Jimmy came back from the main house , they fixed themselves big glasses of chocolate milk for lunch and were drinking it on the front steps when le pere walked up from the garage . <p> " Hi , kids " he said nonchalantly . " Having fun ? " <p> Jimmy said yup ; Nathan said yes . <p> " Is your mother home yet ? " <p> " She 's still at her studio . " <p> " So , what are you two doing this afternoon ? " <p> " Hey , Dad " Nathan said , suddenly realizing that they had n't done anything together , just the three of them , in a long time , " do you want to come fishing ? " <p> " Fishing ? " <p> Nathan could tell le pere was trying to think of an excuse to get out of it . <p> " Are there fishing rods ? " <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 've got to fire a kiln this afternoon . Let 's go another day , all right ? I 'm going to be too hot to do anything today except jump in for a quick dip . Why do n't you and Jimmy go fishing ? " <p> Their father disappeared into the house to make himself some lunch . They stayed on the steps , listening to the sounds coming from the kitchen . They knew he was making his customary peanut butter and banana sandwich and washing a piece of fruit . They also knew it was hopeless to try and get him to come fishing . They did n't say that , they did n't have to . It was enough just to be on the step together , caught in the sound of their father 's lunch-making activities . The resentment they both felt slowly disappeared into the heavy trill of the insects . <p> " Know what I think ? " Jimmy was digging her toes into the warm gravel . " I bet they did n't want kids . I bet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident . But then they realized it was n't so bad so they decided to have you . " <p> " Yeah , they wanted me , and they only kept you because they could n't send you back . " <p> " Whatever . Do you want to go fishing ? " <p> " I ai n't never done it before . " <p> Their father , who was coming out the front door with a sandwich in his hand , said , " Jimmy , only uneducated people use ' ai n't . ' Your parents have college degrees , and I do n't want to hear it , okay ? " <p> " Okay " she said . She pushed her hair out of her eyes and looked up at Nathan . " You 're going to have to teach me how to fish . " <p> " Sure " he said . But he 'd only done it once or twice himself , and that was a long time ago . <p> The two of them walked down the road to the main house . Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken his off and was walking barefoot to toughen up the soles of his feet . In the gloomy coolness of the barn , he saw a bunch of fishing rods propped against the back wall . He took down two and handed Jimmy a tackle box he saw in the corner . Then he rummaged around in the gardening shed till he found a trowel . <p> " What 's that for ? " <p> " Bait . " <p> " What 're we going to use for bait ? " <p> " I 'm going to use worms . You can use whatever you want to use . " <p> By the house , they could hear the music from the lawn where the dancers were rehearsing . When they walked around to the other side , they could see the three women twirling around in brightly colored skirts and then , one by one , dive down onto the grass , their skirts opened around them . <p> " Do n't they look like flowers ? " Jimmy asked . <p> Nathan thought they just looked like girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drum hanging from a shoulder strap so he could drum and dance at the same time . <p> " So what 're you going to do ? " Nathan did n't want to look at the dancers anymore . <p> " Do the worms have to get killed ? " <p> " How else are you going to get them onto the hook ? " <p> " I do n't want to kill a worm . " <p> " Fine . Fish with raisins . " <p> " Fish do n't eat raisins . " <p> " Right , they do n't . " Nathan walked around the pond to the darker side where the willows grew , and squatting in the shade under the trees , he dug away at the dirt . Even there it was dry . The worms had to tunnel deep to find any moisture . He dug down to where the earth was black and pungent and picked out five big fat ones . He closed his fist around them and walked over to the dock , where he put them on the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one into thirds . He left the pieces in a clump under the strong sun . Then he took a fishing rod and poked the hook through one of the worm pieces . Stuff came oozing out around the hook , but Nathan did n't notice . Jimmy had walked over to watch . " You want me to put one on your hook , too ? " <p> " I do n't want to go fishing . " <p> " Okay . Then all of these worms are going to waste because I ca n't use them all . " <p> " Well , you were stupid for cutting them all up . " <p> " You were stupid for saying you were going to come fishing if you were n't going to let me put a worm on your hook . " <p> " I 'm going to get some raisins . " <p> " But you said yourself , fish do n't eat raisins . " <p> " Maybe they do . " She ran off towards the main house , and he watched her make a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patio . When she came back , she put a raisin on her hook and cast the way he had done , her line plunking easily into the center of the pond . <p> " How 'd you learn how to cast like that ? " <p> " Estella told me . " <p> " Estella knows how to fish ? " <p> " Yup , but she 's never caught anything . " <p> " Then she 's a great one to be giving you advice . " <p> " She does n't fish for fish . She fishes for spirits . The pond goes to the underworld , and if you want to fish , you have to ask the spirits if you can join them . " <p> " Is that what you did ? " <p> She nodded , and when he looked at her skeptically , she said , " You do n't have to ask them out loud . You just ask them in your head . " <p> " Whatever . " He felt himself floating up to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the fact that they sat there , on the end of the dock , the two of them , all afternoon , and fished , he with pieces of worm and she with raisins , and caught nothing at all , and did n't even feel a tug , did n't matter . It was summer , there was nothing to do , and all he knew about was how to go from one thing to another thing , and there was no way that he could see to make any of it string together . <p> At dinner that night , Jimmy did n't sit next to him . She helped Estella serve . When their mother noticed her absence , she said , " Nathan , where 's Jimmy ? " <p> Though he knew she had gone to the kitchen , it did n't seem necessary to tell that to his mother , so he pretended he did n't know . Just then , Jimmy came out with bowls of soup . <p> " You 're serving ? " <p> Jimmy nodded yes happily . Estella had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around from person to person , leaning over their right shoulder and placing a bowl of soup on their plate . <p> " When are you going to eat ? " <p> " I 'm going to eat in the kitchen , " Jimmy said . <p> " But I do n't see you all day long . I really want you to eat with us . " <p> She looked at le pere . " Honey , do n't you agree ? " " She should do what she wants . " <p> When Jimmy came out next with a bowl of freshly grated cheese , which she offered to each guest for their soup , la mere said , " Jimmy , do n't you want to eat with us ? <p> " Estella 's teaching me how to cook , " she said proudly . <p> When she went back to the kitchen , la mere turned to Mack and Phyllis and said , " I hardly see her . I really want to have her with us at dinner . " <p> " This is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her all night , Judy . " <p> " And look at her , " Phyllis added . " She 's so happy to have the responsibility . " <p> That night Mack invited them all into the living room for after-dinner drinks . Nathan and Jimmy each got sherry . Jimmy was heading into the dining room to practice the piano when Phyllis said , " Jimmy , dear , you know we love to hear you play , but tonight I wanted to put on some records . Just for a change . " <p> " Come here , sweetheart , " their mother called . " I want to talk to you . " She held out her arms , and when Jimmy came over , la mere gave her a long hug . " So what did you do this morning with Estella ? " <p> " I helped her chop up vegetables . " <p> " That was all ? " <p> " She showed me how to make a pie crust . " <p> " You mean that delicious pie crust was yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , honey , I 'm so proud of you . It was so light and flaky . Really terrific . Gosh , when we get back home , maybe you can teach me . I 'm such an old poop at baking . " <p> Suddenly , dance music filled the living room . Phyllis grabbed Mack , and the two of them swung around , arm in arm , like people in a movie . Erik chose Natalie , and they moved around the room in dramatic movements that included a lot of swooping and twirling . Le pere and la mere shuffled around in each other 's arms with smiles plastered on their faces , and Molly came over to Nathan . " Put down your glass , and I 'll teach you how to do it . " <p> He froze up right away because he could n't imagine how he could ever fit against her without crushing into her boobs . But Molly seemed very comfortable with the idea and put his left arm around her waist and his right arm around her neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered him into the center of the room . " Just do what I do . And relax . You feel as stiff as a piece of cardboard . " <p> But all Nathan wanted was to get back to his glass of wine . Her perfume was suffocating him , and her bosom , which she pushed against him , closing up the distance , felt dangerous . Also , he was certain he was going to step on her toes . <p> " Loosen up " Molly whispered . " I 'm not going to bite you . Now , lift your arm up . I 'm going to twirl around . There . That was n't so hard , was it ? Now , you twirl . " <p> He wobbled around and managed to find her on the return . <p> " Well , okay . A little stiff , because you 're moving like a robot , but not bad . You know what you should do ? You should come out on the lawn with us . Try some improvising . You 're not trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Tomorrow afternoon , why do n't you come out ? " <p> The song ended , and Molly released him . Nathan went back to his glass , but afraid that someone else would make him dance , he did n't stay in the living room . He went into the kitchen looking for Jimmy . But the kitchen was dark . Still holding his glass , he went outside . There was a soft breeze , a scent of freshly cut grass , and animals singing in the distance , insects , frogs , he did n't know exactly . Above the barn he saw a light on in the small apartment Estella had . There were steps cut into the hillside , and at the top , the door was partly open . But he could n't tell if Jimmy was in there or not . <p> " I found two of my best fishing rods down at the dock this morning , " Mack said at dinnertime the next day . " Now . " He paused , looked around the room at each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as guests , you are entitled to make use of all the equipment , which includes a rowboat , a canoe , fishing rods , lifejackets , wading boots , the golf cart , the jeep . But anything you use I expect you to return in good condition to the spot you found it in . That 's just my little rule . Maybe it does n't make sense . There was n't much dew this morning , and the fishing rods probably were n't hurt by being outside , but when I saw them I had to ask myself who would be so careless with equipment that did n't belong to them . " <p> Estella came in with a platter of roast lamb . Jimmy followed her with two bowls , one of mint jelly , one of gravy . They served Mack first , and when his plate was full , he put his napkin on his lap and looked up at them and said , " Well , I 'm sure you 'll all respect my wishes . Even Nathan and Jimmy , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I left them out . I just forgot . " <p> " I left mine out , too , " Jimmy said . " We wo n't do it again . " <p> " Now that 's impressive , " Phyllis said to Mack . <p> " They 're good kids , " Mack said offhandedly . " Good kids . " <p> Their mother and father were smiling . Everyone was smiling . <p> Molly , as though she were oblivious to what was going on , broke in with , " This is such tasty lamb , so tender . " <p> Phyllis called , " Estella , you 're getting compliments ! Everyone loves your lamb ? <p> " Thank you , " Estella called back . Jimmy appeared with a tureen of peas . She went to Mack first , but he waved her away , saying , " I 'm a healthy man , Jimmy , and peas are the one vitamin pill I do n't take . " <p> On Friday Nathan scored one hundred on Mademoiselle 's test on nouns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ones he wanted to learn . She handed him a fresh pencil from her pencil case , and he wrote down the first five that came to mind : to swim , to row , to walk , to dance , to worry . <p> " Does a boy who is your age like to dance ? " Mademoiselle asked . <p> He said that he hated to dance . <p> " That is another one , to hate . Do you like to walk ? " <p> " No , " he told her , he hated it more than dancing . <p> " Then what do you like to do ? " she asked . <p> He looked at her hard , angular chest , trussed up behind the shiny fabric of her blouse , and said that he liked to fish . <p> " Ah , fish , all boys like to fish . Every time you fish , you think , pecher . Tell me about the biggest fish you ever caught . " <p> " I do n't catch any . " <p> " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It was true . And patience was something that Nathan knew how to practice . At that moment , for instance , he was waiting for answers to several questions that had developed over the two weeks they 'd been at Mack 's place . The first was about Mack himself . What did he want with Nathan ? The second had to do with Estella . What was she teaching Jimmy ? The third was , when would disaster strike ? <p> Nathan was fond of catastrophes : train wrecks , airplane crashes , hurricanes , tornadoes . One moment everything was its normal boring self , and the next moment the world was skewed to a weird angle , and there was nothing familiar anywhere . Such amazing changes woke everybody up and gave them new energy . Because as he saw it , everyone was drifting off to sleep , forgetting to pay attention . His mother was painting ponds in her studio all day long . His father was making vases . The dancers were improvising on the lawn . According to Erik , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with organic form . But when Nathan looked at them , he thought they were just out there trying to be children again and looking stupid in the process . <p> Meanwhile , the world was drying up around them . The pond was evaporating , the dirt was crusting over , the leaves on everything were going brown . Grasshoppers were everywhere , clicking in and out of the dry grasses , and any fish that knew their business were hanging out down at the bottom of the pond , away from heat and fishermen and sunlight . <p> And Mack . Mack was taking him off to the forest every morning . Jimmy was spending more and more time up in the apartment over the barn with Estella . And sometimes she stayed with her in the kitchen after dinner , helping her to clean up . Nathan was on a campaign to be nice to la soeur because if she disappeared completely , there would be no one out there at all . <p> That morning after he 'd dragged the water wagon to every tree they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a long drink the big tank on the truck was halfway down , he 'd gone back to wait until they were finished planting the new ones . He was also waiting for Mack , who had gone down to inspect the trees they 'd put in last week . <p> When he came up to Nathan , he was breathing heavily , and his face under the wide brim of the cowboy hat was as red as a piece of raw meat . " Come here , son , there 's something back in here I want to show you . " <p> Nathan followed him into an area of the forest where there were trees with thin , shaggy trunks standing against the sky like prison bars . Mack squatted down and pushed some leaves away from a low green plant with small pink blossoms . " See this here . This is herb Robert . It grows in the shade , and it looks delicate , but herb Robert can withstand a lot of tough weather conditions before it gives up . A pretty little plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything . Well , let 's sit down here next to herb Robert . " He plopped down to the ground heavily , took off his cowboy hat . " Tell me , Nathan , is there anything you want that maybe your parents wo n't buy for you ? " <p> Nathan looked up in surprise . <p> " Hell , that 's not such an unusual question . Money 's tight , I know that . Your dad does n't make a lot . I 'm a businessman , he 's an artist . It 's how the world works . And it 's not fair , but the truth is that I 've got more than I can use , and maybe there 's something expensive , or maybe that your parents do n't approve of , that you would like to have . " <p> " That 's very nice of you " Nathan said . <p> " Do you have a good bike ? I never see you riding a bike . " <p> " I do n't particularly like bike riding , " Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own professional fishing rod ? You 'd like that . " <p> " Well , you have so many here already , and I do n't have a place to fish at home . " <p> " Yeah , that 's right . Well , then , what about .. , let 's see . Maybe I can buy you your first suit . Custom-fit by my tailor . Now that 's something . " <p> " Well ... " Nathan looked at the ground . " I guess I would feel bad that I was getting something and Jimmy was n't . " <p> Mack moved in closer . Now he was sitting right on top of herb Robert . <p> " You 're crushing the flower , " Nathan said . <p> " What ? Oh , does n't matter , it 's just a plant , there 's millions of them , right ? Now ... " <p> " It will heal what 's ailing you , " Nathan said quietly . <p> " Maybe so , but listen to me , son , I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your age , I thought about girls a lot . Know what I mean ? Every kid your age is curious . Maybe you 'd like some pictures to look at . Would you like that ? " <p> Nathan did n't say anything , so Mack went on . " Naked girls . Have n't you ever seen them ? Now , I 'm not talking about your mother or your sister . I 'm talking about women showing you everything a boy wants to see , and naked guys , too . When I was your age , I had this uncle , and he did things like that for me , things like I would like to do for you . I could special-order these pictures , see , and they 'd be here in two days , and we 'd find a hiding place where you could keep them . Would you like that ? And how about a bunch of candy bars and some bottles of soda , because I know your mother does n't let you have that stuff . Your old uncle takes care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girlie pictures and guy pictures ? Does n't matter to me , you can have both . And soda . Our little secret . Want to shake on it ? " <p> Nathan put his hands in his pockets and said , " That 's okay . " <p> Mack looked at him straight on , his eyes opened wide in the shade , everything that had been hidden before right there in plain sight . He touched Nathan on his knee , and Nathan drew back . " Well , give me a hand up , " Mack said . <p> As they walked out of the forest , Mack put his arm around Nathan 's shoulder . It sat up there like a piece of concrete , making him go stiff . When they reached the field , Nathan ducked out from underneath it and ran off into the trees . <p> That afternoon he asked Jimmy if she wanted to go in the boat with him . She said okay , as long as he did n't fish because she could n't bear it if he cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worm crud on the dock from the ones he 'd left there after the last time . Nathan squatted down to see how they had decomposed . They did n't look like worms at all anymore , more like smush . So that 's what happened when everything in you dried out ; you were just a hollow piece of dried-up nothing . <p> Jimmy pushed the boat into the water , and Nathan stepped down into it from the dock , trying to do it in such a way that would n't make it tip . But it did , and Jimmy had to grab onto the sides to keep from sliding out . " Do n't ever do that again " she said . " You could have made me spill right over . " <p> He apologized because he wanted her to like being with him . " Let 's go over to the willows , " he suggested , because he knew she liked floating in the darkness under the leaves . <p> " No , let 's stay out in the open for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered them out to the middle of the pond . <p> " Where 's the underworld ? " he asked . <p> She was hanging off the side of the boat , her fingers trailing in the water . " It 's underneath us . " <p> " What 's in it ? " <p> " All the spirits . " <p> " What spirits ? " <p> " All the spirits of the trees and the animals and the plants . " " So what are they down there for ? I mean , what does it matter to us ? " <p> " Lots " she said secretly . <p> " Come on , Jimmy , tell me . " <p> " I do n't know if Estella wants me to tell anybody else . It 's sort of special . You ca n't just tell anybody . " <p> " You can tell me . I 'm your brother . And I know something about it , too . " <p> " What do you know ? " <p> " I know about this weed called herb Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it grows in the shade and it has a little pink blossom . " <p> " Where does it grow ? " <p> " Near where they 've been planting the trees . " <p> " Show me , okay ? " <p> " I will if you tell me . " <p> Jimmy sat up on the bench and hooked her hair behind her ears . In a different tone of voice she said , " See , how it works is they 're down there to help us . What you have to do is dive down into the pond , all the way down , and then you have to find an animal to take you into the underworld . " <p> " Yeah , and you drown in the process . " <p> " I do n't have to tell you any of this . " <p> " I 'm sorry . I really want to know , okay ? I 'm sorry . " <p> " You do n't dive down for real . You do it in your imagination . It 's like playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underworld , you can ask a plant or a tree , whoever comes up to you , for help with your problem . We 've been doing it a lot , Estella and me , up in her bedroom . Erik 's drumming outside , and the drumming helps us to stay focused . " <p> " I have a problem . " <p> " Okay , tell me , I 'll go to the underworld tomorrow with Estella . " <p> " I ca n't tell you . " <p> " What 's it about , then ? " <p> " It 's about Mack . " <p> " What happened ? " Jimmy asked , suddenly worried . <p> " Nothing happened , and nothing 's going to happen ? " Suddenly , he did n't trust anything Jimmy was saying . " How do you know Estella 's not playing a big joke on you ? She 's just a cook , she probably never even finished high school . " <p> " You do n't have to be educated to know things . And she knows things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's from New York . I heard Mack talking about her . She lives in Brooklyn . " <p> " Yeah , but she lived in Jamaica when she was a little girl . " <p> " So , that does n't mean anything . " <p> " Well , you do n't have to believe in it , Nathan . And if I do , that 's my business . " She picked the oars up and rowed them towards the swampy side of the pond . She did n't go far into it , though ; she stopped before the water got too shallow . Nathan could touch the cattails . He saw a bird 's nest among them and craned his head to see if there were any eggs . He caught a spot of blue , startling against the dull colors of the rushes . It was a blue as intense as Mack 's bloodshot eyes . <p> " It has n't rained in four weeks , " Jimmy said . <p> " I know . I 'm the one who has to water all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Who cares ? " <p> " You might not like Mack , but you can care about the trees , at least . " <p> " They 're his trees , why should I ? " <p> " Estella 's going to ask the spirits to help the trees ? " <p> " I 'm sure she is . " <p> " Do n't be sarcastic . She 's going to ask them to bring rain ? " <p> " Rain happens when the right atmospheric conditions are present . And when they are present , it will rain . And it wo n't if they 're not there . " <p> " Do you know something ? You 're ignoring something very obvious . What people think affects the world . What they want affects the world . What they ask for ... if they ask for it hard enough , it will happen . " <p> " Sure . I want a car , and a car 's going to appear . " <p> " You have to really want it , and it has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what if there is n't a natural thing that I want ? I 'm not ever going to get anything ? " <p> Jimmy ignored his question . " I want rain . Estella wants rain . The trees want rain . It 's going to rain . " <p> He looked at her with hatred . <p> " Not for Mack " she added . " I want rain for the trees . " <p> That afternoon when Mademoiselle came , she asked him to write down fifteen verbs as quickly as possible . As he did it , she went to the sink and filled two glasses with water . She put one in front of him and sat down across from him and drank hers . <p> " Quickly , quickly , we have much to do . " He pushed the paper across to her . She looked at his words and then wrote the French beside the English . When she was done , the list looked like this : <p> preto swim  --  nagerto follow  --  suivreto suspect  --  soupconnerto laugh  --  rireto cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ se tracasserto row  --  tamerto watch  --  regarderto fear  --  craindreto fall  --  tomberto give up  --  abandonnerto refuse  --  refuserto kick  --  donner un coup de pied " This is just a little test I do with all my students . Une evaluation psychologique . Okay ? " She put a check besides " suspect , " " cry " " worry " " be afraid " " fall , " " give up , " " refuse " " kick . " " Eight negatives . Seven positives . You are borderline , Nathan . That is , there is much that is on your mind , and it threatens to overtake your happiness , but it has n't yet . I suggest to you to have more fun . It will help with the worry , the suspicion , the fear . Right ? And you must n't feel bad about it . Everyone worries , everyone suspects , everyone is afraid . It is human nature . Brush those feelings aside and have fun . If it is French you are worried about , you are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your words , and you 'll be fine . Next time if you have learned all of the verbs , I will bring you a reward . That is something you can look forward to , yes ? " <p> The screen door opened , and le pere walked in . His pants were covered with clay and he tracked clay across the floor . " Hi , Nathan ! Bonjour ... " <p> Nathan could tell that le pere had intended to say the French teacher 's name but then discovered that he no longer remembered what it was . <p> " If you 'll excuse me , I 'm just going to make myself a sandwich , and then I 'll be out of your way . " <p> Nathan could n't concentrate as long as le pere was in the room . He hoped that he would n't be too obvious about the kind of sandwich he was making . Peanut butter and banana would strike a French woman as being pretty weird . Add to it , le pere 's ragged clothes and his goofy good humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some big company that made things nobody understood the uses for , someone who wore suits , who drove to work in the morning and did n't return till dinnertime , who made a lot of money , who looked responsible . Nathan glanced at the counter and saw the banana skin lying there in plain view next to the jar of peanut butter . Mademoiselle , meanwhile , was pronouncing each word on the list and pausing for him to repeat it after her . Pleurer . Plonger . Nager . Ramer . He noticed that what Mademoiselle called his positive verbs had to do with water . <p> Jimmy played " Fur Elise " during cocktails . Each evening when she sat down at the piano , he would think , Not again ! But then the song would start , and no matter how aloof he tried to be , the music pulled him in . It was so melodious , so rich and dark , so full of all his hidden feelings , he had to listen . The piece was a perfect balance of logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he knew one thing for sure . Dance was only emotion . Painting was only emotion . That 's why they were n't pure art like music . <p> People had moved onto the patio because it was so hot . Nathan went outside , too . He stood against the cool wall of the house close to the window so he could continue to listen . No one else paid any attention . La mere , sitting across from him , was laughing loudly . She wore a pink dress with a ruffled neckline , and her bare arms , freckled from the sun , were pretty . Molly was laughing , too . Her blouse was unbuttoned so far down he could see her bosom looking at him straight on . Natalie was standing in a corner talking in an animated way with Erik . She had very white skin and dark hair , and there was something quick and silvery about her , she flashed in and out . Nathan tried to imagine her having sex with Erik . He pictured a billowing , a glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they were both listening to the same melody in their heads . It would get louder , they would rise higher and higher , and then finally it would burst just as it did now on the piano . The piece ended , there was a pause , and then a little bit later , the opening measure sounded again . Molly put down her drink and , saying " Excuse me " to la mere , went into the hot , se . Nathan pulled himself away from the wall and followed her . What if she knew he was following her and had ducked into an empty bedroom to wait for him , and when he came after , she closed the door and turned to face him , her blouse open all the way down ? Nipples was a subject he hardly dared to think about . <p> She stopped at the olives , took some , and then went into the dining room . He stayed back in the shadows , but at a spot where he could see her waving her arms to get Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were closed , her body was sloshing in and out . " Jimmy ! " <p> Molly broke the trance . Jimmy looked up , and the music stopped . Molly 's nipples would be large and pink . He would want to put his tongue on them . <p> " Excuse me ? " Jimmy said in a startled tone . <p> " Do n't you know any other songs ? I mean , is this one the only one you can play ? " <p> " No " Jimmy said defensively . <p> " Well , then , why do n't you give us all a break and play something else for a while . " <p> Jimmy looked at her uncomprehendingly . Then she simply started the song where she had stopped , staring at Molly until she turned around and went out . <p> By that time , Nathan was sitting on the couch . " Hi ! " he said in a friendly way . <p> Molly gave him an annoyed look . Then she took her olive pits out of her mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know what I am . " <p> " No , I guess not . " <p> Nathan looked at her smugly , daring himself to go on . " I 'm a brilliant student , a brilliant student of love . Would you be my teacher ? " <p> Molly went out , the screen door slamming behind her . <p> Because it was so hot Estella served a light meal . There were salads and thinly sliced bread and cold cuts . Jimmy brought everything out to the sideboard in the dining room , and everyone helped themselves . Phyllis said , " Mack , why should we sit in here ? We 'll be much cooler if we eat outside . " <p> " There 's only two tables , Phyllis . It wo n't be very comfortable . " <p> " The kids can put their plates on their laps , ca n't they ? Do you want to do that , Nathan ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Jimmy ? " <p> " Jimmy 's in the kitchen with Estella . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm ready " Erik said suddenly and stood up with his napkin and plate . Everyone else followed him outside . <p> The patio looked out over the lawn that tumbled down to the willows and the pond . Nathan pulled his chair to the edge of the patio and looked at the view . Behind him , he heard la mere say to Mack and Phyllis , " You need some swans on that pond and some peacocks strutting around with their tails open . " <p> " Then you 've got bird droppings " Mack said . <p> " Sweetie , Judy was n't being serious . She was just talking aboutfantasy . No one wants you to actually go out and do it . Everyone 's very happy with just the way things are . " <p> " Well , there is one thing , " Judy said . <p> " What is it ? Tell me . You know I 'm always looking for suggestions . " That was Phyllis . <p> " Next summer , if you do this again , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ? " <p> " Terrific idea ! A regular artist colony . Right here in West Redding , Connecticut . The only problem is the musicians . We 'd have to build them studios in the woods , otherwise they 'd disturb the writers . " <p> " And then at the end of the summer , " la mere went on , " everyone could do a grand collaboration . " <p> " A piece of cacophonous nonsense , " le pere added . <p> " Nonsense it might be " la mere agreed , " but it would be fun . " <p> Nathan remembered Mademoiselle 's advice to him to have more fun . The word was meaningless . It was one of those trick words like happy . If you thought about fun or happiness , it meant that you were n't feeling the real thing . The real thing happened only if you were unaware of it . He looked down at the pond and realized there was movement at the end of the dock . Was it Natalie and Erik ? He looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Molly . <p> He turned back to the pond and saw a large white bird gliding over the water . " Mom ! " he called . <p> But la mere was laughing at something Phyllis had said . Her cheeks were as pink as her dress , and by the time she had finished and Nathan looked out at the pond again , the bird was gone . He could see who was down there now . It was Jimmy with someone in a chair next to her , whom he assumed was Estella . He wondered if they 'd seen the bird , too . For a moment , he thought about running down there to tell them about it , but then he noticed their heads were almost touching and they seemed to be deeply involved in whatever they were doing , so he decided to stay where he was . <p> On most nights , it started to cool down by nine o'clock . But that evening , it seemed to get hotter . Phyllis brought out candles on footed candle sticks and set them around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Le pere pulled a chair up next to Nathan . " Nice place , is n't it ? " he said . " I was so embarrassed today . I could n't remember your French teacher 's name . Do you think she noticed ? What is it , anyway ? " <p> " Mlle. Tanguy . " <p> " Tanguy . Well , I 'll try to get it right next time . " <p> " It 's okay , I do n't think she noticed . " <p> " So how 's it going ? " <p> " Fine . " <p> " Do things seem familiar ? Is she covering the same sorts of things you got in school ? " " Oh , much more . " <p> " And are you paying attention and studying ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Good , because we 're paying her a good salary . I 'll tell you something , this French is n't coming to you cheap . " <p> " If I went to summer school back home , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wishing you were going to summer school ? Do you know how hot it is in Philadelphia right now ? You think this is bad . And you can swim here and fish and boat , and you and your sister are free to do whatever you want all day long . It seems to me you 're just about the luckiest kid in the world . " <p> " I know , Dad . " <p> But that did n't satisfy his father because he went on . " When I think back to the summers I spent in Cleveland when I was your age , living in an apartment , no place to swim ... You 're in a paradise , thanks to Mack and Phyllis . You know that ? " <p> " Yes , Dad . " <p> " So take advantage , kid . " <p> The moon came up over the willows , a yellow lamp hanging in the darkness . The bullfrogs croaked down at the pond , and all around them in the grass , insects sang . <p> " Last one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ran across the patio , Natalie behind him . <p> A few moments later there were splashes in the water . " Hey , it 's nice ! " Natalie called . <p> " Are they going skinny-dipping ? " Molly asked the people on the terrace . <p> Nathan ran down the lawn in his bare feet . The pond was a bowl of moonlight . The frogs had gone silent , and he could hear Natalie call , " Over here , I 'm over here ! " Nathan stepped onto the dock and slipped out of his clothes . He was careful to leave them in a pile separate from the others so he 'd be able to find them again . " No , silly , over here . " The air felt good on the tender parts of his body . Bits of grass had stuck to his bare feet . He rubbed them on the dry wood to get them off . Suddenly there was a lot of splashing in the water and laughter . He wondered if Jimmy was in there , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm diving in ! " <p> The brilliant student of love 's pubescent body knifed through the moon , scattering it into fragments . " Is that you , Nathan ? " Jimmy asked . She swam over to him , her disembodied face floating on the surface of the water . <p> " Did you see that bird swooping over the pond ? " he asked her . <p> " You saw it , too ? " <p> " Yeah , it was amazing . " <p> " Not so loud , " Jimmy whispered . Her eyes looked enormous . He plinked a little water in her direction and in a low voice said , " What was it ? " <p> " Just Estella . See ... " Jimmy pointed up at the lawn , and Nathan saw the same great white form crossing it at the top . " It 's her uniform , it glows . " <p> " But it looked like it was out in the middle of the water . " <p> " It looked like it was because you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to see everything . " Suddenly she flipped back and floated away from him . <p> " Hey ? he called after her . He had no idea where Natalie or Erik were , and suddenly there were another three splashes into the pond . People were paddling towards him . He swam away quickly because he hated them all and the only one he wanted to be with was Jimmy . " Jimmy ! " he whispered . <p> " Over here , " she said from the direction of the willows . <p> " Wait for me ! " he cried . <p> " I 'll wait , but hurry . " <p> He moved across the water without making a sound and got away from the other people . " Jimmy ? " <p> " Come in closer , " she whispered , " but you have to be very quiet . " <p> He saw her white arm on top of the water and swam towards it . She reached out and pulled him in . Then he saw her face , her blue lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stay very still , the frogs 'll start singing again . But we have to be very still . " <p> " Those guys out there are making a racket " <p> She put her finger to her lips . " Shh ! They 'll go away soon , and the frogs will think we went with them . Just be quiet . " <p> His penis was so shriveled from the cold water it was no bigger than his pinkie . He was a nothing , worse than a nothing . Jimmy looked at him steadily . He realized he trusted her more than he trusted anyone else in the world . So he stayed there next to her . They must have hung there , just outside the branches of the willows , treading water for half the night . The voices at the other end went away eventually . He heard laughter on the lawn . " You 're wearing my shirt ! " someone cried . After that , the sounds died away . Sometime later , he wondered if le pere and la mere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children were gone . Maybe they 'd come searching with flashlights . They 'd make so much noise the frogs would never start singing again . He was about to suggest to Jimmy that they give up . But then he heard a croak . And then another one . Soon there was croaking all around them , then there was trilling , then there was peeping . All the frogs were singing into the night , the bullfrogs , the peepers , the toads . The amphibian population was sawing away at the edges of a pond they assumed was empty , and he and Jimmy were suspended together in the middle of it . Her fingers snaked over the water and found his , and they held hands and listened . <p> Later , much later , when even the moon was covered over by a cloud , they climbed back onto the dock . They put on whatever clothes they could find and did n't even try to look for their shoes , but started up the lawn barefoot . When they reached the big house the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were voices , hardly audible against the sounds of the night . Nathan heard Mack 's gravely laugh . He knew that in another step they 'd throw out shadows , so he grabbed Jimmy by the wrist and pulled her away . They started to laugh when they got to the barn . Nathan led Jimmy out to the grassy circle inside the curve of the driveway , and they both lay down inside it . <p> " I hate Mack " Nathan said . <p> " Why ? " <p> " He wants to buy me magazines " He knew that would n't make any sense to Jimmy , so he added , " So I can look at naked girls " <p> Jimmy laughed . " What 's so bad about that ? " <p> " He 's creepy . " <p> " He 's nice to me . " <p> " That 's because he does n't want to have sex with you . " <p> Jimmy was quiet . He did n't know if she understood how a man could have sex with a boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he felt better . <p> " I went to the underworld . I talked to the willow tree , and a frog was my messenger . " <p> " How 'd you do that ? " <p> " In my imagination . " <p> " But Jimmy , maybe it 's all made up , then . " <p> He could tell he 'd disappointed her because she said in a defensive tone , " It is , and it is n't . It just has to do with what you want to believe . " <p> " So do you believe it ? " he asked , afraid of what her answer would be . <p> " I do . I never doubted anything . Not even from the very beginning . " <p> " So what does it mean ? I mean , what difference does it make ? " <p> Jimmy said simply , " I think it means that people are n't the only ones in the world who can feel things . " <p> " Oh great " Nathan replied , but as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> That night , there was drumming in his sleep . Erik was just outside the window , calling to him with his drum . Nathan wanted to keep sleeping , but the sound was hypnotic , and he was soon climbing out of the window to join him . Natalie , Molly , and Jimmy were dancing in the darkness . They made a circle around him , and then they reached for his hand . With Erik at the lead , they snaked in and out of the trees . Nathan was n't thinking about anything ; he was just moving to the sounds , noticing every so often how loose and relaxed he felt . Then he was with Jimmy , and they were diving off the dock into the pond . He opened his eyes underwater and followed his sister 's naked body down into the grass at the bottom . An oak tree grew down there . Jimmy said , " Hello , oak tree . I 'd like to come to the underworld . Would you send me an escort ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and disappeared . Nathan stayed by the tree . After a while it seemed apparent that an escort was n't going to come for him . Finally the tree broke the silence , and in a voice that matched his father 's , it said , " Do n't you know , son , nothing comes without the asking . " <p> " I can ask , " Nathan said , and he looked into the watery darkness and asked , " Please , can you send me an escort ? " <p> " You can ask " the tree replied , " but asking only works if it 's something you truly want . " <p> The next morning the sky was green . At first the sun shone weakly , but then it was covered over by white clouds . The air was very humid . As his parents and the dancers dug holes for the trees , the shovels clanked against the rocks loudly . Nathan was pulling the wagon along the row of already-planted trees , giving each one a good drink . The tiny leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to yellow , particularly on the trees that were planted earlier in the summer , so Nathan gave those the most water . He squatted down and nestled the hose right into the roots . " There " he said , " you 'll like that . That 's just what you want . Is n't that good ? Yes , that 's just what you 've been missing . " He hardly realized he was talking to them , it just came out of his mouth each time as he dug a little hole for the hose to go down into . He counted to three hundred and then he planted the hose into a new tree . The water spilled over his sneakers , pooled in crevices of hard dirt . Leaves and blossoms floated on top of it . Then something caught his eye . A flicker of a different color . It was white and out of place . Mack 's white shirt appeared and , above it , the raw meat of his jowls . <p> " Who 're you talking to , Nathan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just heard you say something . Who were you talking to , my boy ? " <p> " Myself . " <p> Mack chucked him on the shoulder . " Well , guess what , kid , I 've got something for you . " Mack reached into a paper bag and pulled out a thin glossy magazine . " This is yours . " <p> " No thank you " <p> Water was carrying away the peat moss that had been laid around the base of the tree . <p> " You do n't know what you 're missing . " Mack flung the magazine open , and there on the ground was Molly 's bright pink body , completely unbuttoned and bare . He saw the nipples and the mysterious place he had always wondered about , and as he looked at her , he noticed the changes inside of him . <p> " You can put your hand on her , Nathan . " Mack took his fingers and guided them to the very spot he had been looking at . He hardly noticed what Mack was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew he was touching a picture , a stupid picture , so it was n't a big deal . But still he wanted to . He wanted to feel it with his whole body , he wanted to pull his pants off and roll around on top of it . He wanted to put the picture into his mouth and eat her . He smelled something . Mack 's tongue was moving around in his ear , and his hand was on Nathan 's thigh , but what he smelled was the pungent scent of the earth as the water moistened it . Mack 's hand was in his crotch , making him so hard he was afraid he was going to explode . Then Mack started to unzip his pants , but the zipper did n't move . It must have been jammed . Mack tried again . Nathan looked at the beefy fingers fumbling at his hips , and right then , just as the man finally got the zipper to go down , he felt himself ejaculate . He was so embarrassed he slapped the hands away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flipped up into Mack 's lap . Mack cursed as the water gurgled over his clothes , but Nathan did n't hear anything , he was streaking through the woods , running like a scared child . He ran past the planters , past the truck , and then ducked back into the woods and made his way down the hillside . When he reached their cottage , the first thing he did was run into the bathroom . He ripped off his clothes and stood in the shower in his underwear , letting the water run as hot as he could stand . Then he peeled the drawers off his body and , leaving the shower running , stuffed them in the trash can under the kitchen sink . He ran back through his wet footprints , got back into the shower , and soaped and shampooed vigorously . But once he was clean and rinsed off , he stayed there , under the water . <p> By the time Mademoiselle arrived , he was dressed and the floor was wiped up and the trash can under the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incinerator . <p> " Did you study your verbs , Nathan ? " <p> He gave her the list and was able to pronounce each one correctly . <p> " Tres bien ! Now I will give you my reward ! " <p> He had forgotten about the reward , and when she took out a paperback book written in French with a title he did n't understand , he said , " Merci , Mademoiselle . " <p> " We will start reading this soon , once you 've finished your sentences . What 's it called ? Can you tell me ? " <p> " Le Chien d'Anton . " <p> " And what does that mean ? Eh ? Do you know ? " When he did n't respond she said , " Well , we have n't done the animals , so ! will tell you . The dog of Anton . Anton 's dog . It is a story about a lost dog and how a boy who does n't have a mother finds him . It is a very sweet story . I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nouns , you know verbs , next we will put them together with connecting words and make sentences . Once you see how to make a sentence , we can really talk to one another . " <p> She wrote " I am " and then left a blank . " Very quickly , I want you to write as many words as you can think of to finish this . For instance , I am tired ' could be one " She pushed the paper over to him . She had written " tired " in the blank . <p> He just looked at it stupidly . <p> " This is so easy , so facile , Nathan . Quickly do it , five or six more words " <p> So he wrote : <p> preI am lost.I am hot.I am curious.I am lumpy.I am stretched . " Okay . " She looked at the list of words but did n't say anything , only printed the French above his English . " Now I am ' is je suis . So each of these sentences begins with je @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , but if they are the words you want , okay . For instance , what does I am lumpy ' mean ? Eh ? I am stretched ' ? It does n't make sense . So I have given you what I think you may mean . Okay , now let 's think of some ordinary sentences that begin with je suis . Je suis affarne . Je suis beau . Je suis un homme . Je suis un frere . " <p> By the time Mademoiselle was ready to leave , the sky had darkened . " It looks like rain " she said when Nathan walked with her to the Citroen . He stood on the driveway , watching her disappear down the road . When he went back into the house , le pere waved at him from the garage . <p> The novel sat on the kitchen table . He carried it into his room and hid it under his underwear in the top dresser drawer . <p> When he stepped back outside , the sky was the color of lead . Wind shook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undersides . He had to push into the wind as he walked down the road . He wanted to find Jimmy . But if she was in the main house he 'd have to get her attention through a window . He did n't want to risk running into Mack . The rain started as he ran down to the pond . No Jimmy . He slammed through the bathhouse , but they never went there , and she was n't there then . Then he ran back up the lawn and swung behind the main house to the barn . It was pouring steadily , water pulsing out of the gutters , flooding the driveway . The tempo increased . A sheet of gray water hung down from the sky , obliterating everything . He ran up the steps at the side of the barn and pounded on Estella 's door at the top . Water spilled off the roof onto his head . Lightning cracked in the sky . He tried the knob because he did n't think anyone could hear him in that racket , and the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was furnished . There was only a trunk and a single bed , no rug , no pictures , no bedspread . What he noticed second was that it was only a room ; there was n't even a bathroom connected to it , and its emptiness stared out at him . <p> He ran through the downpour , over to the main house , and peered into the kitchen window . There she was , kneading dough on the counter . But it was only Estella ; Jimmy was n't in sight . He was about to tap the glass to get her attention when Mack walked into the kitchen , opened the refrigerator , and took out a bottle of beer . Estella turned to say something to him , and Mack laughed . <p> Nathan started to head back to the cottage . His shoes were so wet they were spongy . Water slid down his eyes , spilled off his hair , and into the neck of his shirt . There was no use in hurrying , he was completely soaked . He saw a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He would leak buckets of water onto her floor . He looked at the way the wind tossed the tops of the trees , and , past his mother 's cottage , he cut across the lawn . It was at that moment that lightning split the sky in half and the same winged creature he had seen on the pond swooped over the lawn and fell down . He started to run towards it , but his sneakers flopped off , and without stopping he ran out of them and through the pools of water on the grass . Jimmy was lying on the ground , her clothes stuck onto her skin . He thought she was dead , and feeling rage and panic , he called her name . But it was too noisy , his voice got swallowed . When he knelt down beside her , her face burst into a smile . <p> " I told them we needed rain . And it 's raining . Is n't that amazing ? " <p> " Yeah , " he said , " but it 's lightning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're out in the open , too , and you 're higher than me . And I have rubber soles on my sneakers , and you do n't even have your sneakers on . You 'd better lie down really fiat . Come on , get rained on ? ' <p> So he lay down next to her , and water pounded on his body till he turned flat and muddy . He was n't even a boy anymore . Next to him , Jimmy was n't even a girl . They were so wet , they were rivers of water . They were grass , they were ground , they were sky . <p> <p> By Megan Staffel <p>
