Huckleberry Finn , if grimly read , might be a caseworker 's report on family dysfunction , child abuse , alcoholism , clan violence , stupidity , hypocrisy and institutionalized racial oppression  --  a sweet classic , maybe , but also a fairly accurate picture of life along the Mississippi in the mid-19th century . <P> When one reads the title of William Finnegan 's Cold New World : Growing Up in a Harder Country ( Random House ; 421 pages ; $26 ) , a journalist 's sampler of youth on the margins in the 1990s , one wants to ask , " Harder compared to what ? " To life in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression ? Or to growing up almost anywhere in the developing world today ? In 1998 , in an America presided over by the quintessential Mark Twain character Bill Clinton ( an irrepressible trickster out of Arkansas with late-adolescent hormones ) , the Dow noses up toward 10,000 , and this spring 's college graduates emerge into the best job market in years . If this is " harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But Finnegan understands America , beneath the surface , as many countries and states of mind , some of them deeply disturbing and rotten in unprecedented ways . A staff writer for the New Yorker , Finnegan spent about six years hanging out among the young on the dark edges of postindustrial America . His technique is narrative journalism ( formerly New Journalism , or later , Literary Journalism )  --  reportage as documentary storytelling . In Finnegan , the dazzling special effects of such founding fathers as Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer have given way to an admirable transparency . The author-observer , like a good scientist in nature , all but vanishes . Finnegan fleetingly appears from time to time , only as a kind of bemused white-bread oddity wearing burgundy Rockport shoes , set down for a while among black dope dealers in New Haven , Conn. ; or Chicano gangbangers in the Yakima Valley of Washington State ; or piney-woods country people in East Texas ; or , finally , among forlornly vicious white junior Nazis , feral and bored to death , in Antelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  rarely judging or mongering a thesis  --  strings the adolescents ' stories along the common threads he found , the underthemes and structural weaknesses of America now : the destruction of families and absence of parents , the astonishingly pervasive presence of drugs and gun violence , a sort of postmodern lostness and indiscipline . The self-absorbed fecklessness of the adults  --  the abdicated parents in most of these dramas , often useless druggies and alcoholics themselves  --  makes the reader despise them in a way he never quite hated Pap Finn . <P> The teenage neo-Nazis of Antelope Valley  --  skinheads jacked up on crystal methamphetamines and flipping each other Sieg heil salutes , drew this diagnosis from the director of a local gang-prevention center : " Virtually all were abused , sexually and otherwise , as kids , and they hate the world . " A young Nazi makes an unpersuasive victim , but still ... one member of the Sharps  --  an interesting hybrid , skinheads devoted to racial tolerance  --  had a meth-addict mother and a pothead father , an alcoholic stepfather and a favorite aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
