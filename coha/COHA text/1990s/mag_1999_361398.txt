Annie Proulx twirls words like a black-hat badman twirling Colts , fires them off for the sheer hell of it , blam , blam , no thought of missing , empty beer cans jump in the dust , misses one , laughs , reloads , blams some more . Something like that . <P> Words won her the Pulitzer for The Shipping News , no question . The novel itself does n't really track . The main character is gaumless in the first chapters and a functioning human male at the end , simply because the author has decreed a character transplant . But Proulx 's language does not admit " yes , but " or " really ? " When it works , which is most of the time , it sweeps aside all ideas , her own and the reader 's , and allows no response except banging the hands together . Without this mad blaze of confidence , her next novel might have been a hanky dampener . Accordion Crimes traces an old green accordion from hand to calloused hand among turn-of-the-century Italian and German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Proulx , it makes a wonderfully strong , rowdy book . <P> And here 's the sound of Close Range : Wyoming Stories ( Scribner ; 285 pages ; $25 ) , her new collection of short stories : " Pake knew a hundred dirt road shortcuts , steering them through scabland and slope country , in and out of the tiger shits ... " ( the reader fumbles this one but is swept on ) " ... over the tawny plain still grooved with pilgrim wagon ruts , into early darkness and the first storm laying down black ice , hard orange dawn , the world smoking , snaking dust devils on bare dirt , heat boiling out of the sun until the paint on the truck hood curled , ragged webs of dry rain that never hit the ground ... " On this fine recitation goes , by sheer loopy eloquence getting a couple of beat-up bull riders from rodeo to rodeo in their falling-apart pickup , ending with , " ... turning into midnight motel entrances with RING OFFICE BELL signs or steering onto the black prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a story called The Mud Below , and it just about nails pickup trucks and rodeo soldiers . <P> These pieces are , for the most part , Wyoming grotesques . The people are hard , and the view bleak , tending toward melancholy . Brokeback Mountain is a surprise , the matter-of-fact , sorrowing , sketched life of a cowboy and his friend , married men , ordinary sorts , who over the decades never fully realize that they are gay . Real guys are n't gay , because , sex aside , they do n't know how to be gay . A story called The Half-Skinned Steer is as grim as its title , and it begins , " In the long unfurling of his life , from tight-wound kid hustler in a wool suit riding the train out of Cheyenne to geriatric limper in this spooled-out year , Mero had kicked down thoughts of the place where he began , a so-called ranch on strange ground at the south hinge of the Big Horns . " <P> This is a remarkable sentence . There 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preening , of an author too appreciatively tasting her own words . " Spooled-out year " and " kicked down " suggest a man who tossed his mental baggage together in a hurry , and " strange ground " says something of where he is going . As always , when signs are this clear that an author knows her trade , the reader signs on for the journey . <P>  --  By John Skow
