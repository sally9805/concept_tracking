<p> Islands , by their very nature , are fragile environments  --  surrounded , sometimes engulfed , other times stranded . The ancient Maya of northern Guatemala called their island capital in Lake Peten Itza " El Peten , " or the big island . This was the last refuge for the Itza , who had fled south from Yucatan to the tropical forests of Guatemala , and who foretold correctly the year , 1697 , when this last Indian stronghold would fall to the Spanish . <p> The Spanish , in turn , named their conquered capital Remedios ( present-day Flores ) , meaning relief or aid , and called the entire northernmost region of Guat-emala " El Peten . " The name seemed to fit this isolated area , remote as it was  --  and remained so for nearly three centuries  --  a sparsely populated island of dense forest , cut off essentially from the rest of the country . But today Peten is an island no more . <p> The population of Guatemala 's frontier state has ballooned over the last two decades  --  from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided by logging companies , which have opened up roads in the once impenetrable forest . An area once thought bereft of natural resources and attractions  --  archaeologist Sylvanus Morley called it " one of the most difficult New World areas in which to live "  --  is now home to seven logging companies , and has also caught the eye of oil speculators . <p> The new residents of Peten , or Peten-eros , are landless and unfamilar with Peten 's agriculture and forest products . Seeking ways to support themselves and their families , they move north from the highlands to carve a living out of the forest as farmers , or milperos . Ranchers , too , over the last two decades , have discovered the last frontier of Peten . <p> This successive combination of logging , farming , and ranching forms what anthropologist Norman Schwartz , in his book Forest Society , terms a " negative symbiosis . " He has pointed out that increased deforestation over the last fifteen years has led to longer dry seasons , and that the process appears exponential , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to threaten whatever forest patch may be nearby . Perhaps , Schwartz speculates , this is because certain seedcarrying birds and bats , among other animals , will not fly over extensive areas lacking the trees typical of their habitat . <p> In 1990 , in response to Peten 's worsening plight , the Guatemalan government legislated fully 40 percent of the department , or 3.7 million acres , as the Maya Biosphere Reserve . The reserve is divided into three areas : multiple use , core ( including biotopes and national parks ) , and buffer , a nine-mile wide belt , relatively well populated , that surrounds the bio-sphere and helps protect the reserve . And , the government set up an agency to administer the reserve  --  the National Council for Protected Areas ( Consejo de Areas Protegidas  --  CONAP ) . <p> However , as Peteneros , conservationists , and government officials have discovered , designating a reserve is only the first step in the process of forest conservation , re-education , and retraining . What about life after the biosphere ? <p> It is a cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light rain has been falling intermittently throughout the day . At Rolando Soto 's open-air woodcarving workshop in El Remate , on the road to Tikal National Park , six men are huddled around a table only slightly larger than a chessboard , with knives , saws , and vises , their heads bowed , radio blaring . <p> Not unlike a surgical operating table , Rolando is bent over the body of an alligator , while his younger brother Mario scrutinizes the body of a carved , reticulated snake ; Mario puts the head in a vise , cuts it in half , and hands the two pieces to the man next to him . <p> At the end of the day the table is swept clean by old and young alike , the radio is silenced , and children gather in the shadows to show Rolando Soto their own carvings . <p> For the last seven years , Rolando has been working as an artisan in tropical hardwoods , carving objects from fallen trees near his home . He has the eyes and vision of an artist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of Peten hardwoods as a way of preserving them , teaching artisanry , and his ideas for a Peten community supported by income from renewable resources from the forest . <p> On a wall of his workshop is a list of tropical hardwoods he and his carvers use . Cericote , which has a marbled appearance of dark and light swirls , grows quickly and is perfect for carving ; jobillo is golden-brown , and mora is almost blond . This is also where customers  --  most of them on their way to the Maya ruins of Tikal  --  come to buy . Two tables are filled with snails of jobillo , clam shells of cericote , swan-necked spoons of mora ; an enormous armadillo of jobillo seems to preside over everything . <p> Rolando 's parents came to Peten over three decades ago to raise their family of nine children . In that regard , he says , Peten is similar to California : Most Peteneros over the last decades have migrated there from somewhere else . <p> A boy in soccer gear steps forward shyly , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in his hands , then buys , handing the boy a few quetzals . <p> " The idea of artisanry is n't simply a way to make money , but to have people think differently , to have an effect on the way people think . . . . It 's not a religion , " he states with quiet assurance . " It 's a way of life  --  to live in peace . " The idea , the philosophy , behind the cooperative is most important , he says . " The project is more philosophical than material . " <p> Four Soto brothers , as well as seventy residents of El Remate , are employed in the family woodcarving cooperative . According to Rolando , a family of ten can live for one year from the proceeds from the carvings of one tree . The cooperative has also offered workshops to others from outside the area . For example , seven young men from Chimaltenango , in the southern highlands , studied carving techniques with Rolando in a threeweek workshop last spring . The idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrate as milperos . <p> " People have become economically and spiritually dependent , but they do n't have to live badly because they do n't have money . It 's because they 're not open to new ideas ; they 're not opening the right doors . " <p> The right door , to Rolando , is to understand that work can be communication , not drudgery . " It 's a pleasure if you like what you do . " <p> His speech is punctuated with colorful metaphors : Family matters are like cards , he says , there is an ace and a king , with the ace the highest , but it 's worth less than the two , and the king is the king . Meaning : Everyone has a role . <p> All proceeds from the cooperative are shared by the entire family . The family is less concerned with exporting their woodcrafts , but more interested in exporting their ideas for community development : A new woodcarvers ' cooperative currently being built nearby on the lake will be supported by a special committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rolando 's younger brother Manuel says : " In the beginning , my father asked me ' why are you helping those guys to compete ? ' But I said the better thing is to make everybody competent . Competency is n't competition . " <p> The Soto family also manages a group of bungalows , El Mirador del Duende , which hugs the hillside overlooking the woodcarvers ' workshop and Lake Peten-Itza . More than a half-dozen bungalows are spaced throughout the woods , and their windows open like eyes to view the lake . A main dining hall has not only eyes but a nose too , resembling an ancient Maya god . <p> Manuel Soto has been gathering citron-ella , which grows wild throughout Peten ; the smell of lemon fills the air . He manages a small ecotourism business , besides the bungalows , taking tourists on camping excursions through the forests of Peten . As he walks purposefully through the woods he knows so well , he identifies the calls of birds as they pass overhead and pierce the morning air  --  chachalaca , urraca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , Manuel rapidly recites what can be extracted or made from the living tree  --  fruit , flour , soup , cakes , candies . And , like his brother , he speaks in metaphors  --  to create a continuum , the family cooperative must age like wine that undergoes a fermentation process . He adds : " in other cultures , if you 're an architect , maybe you 're son is n't an architect , but here , if you 're an artist , your son is going to be an artist , and a better artist than you . " <p> On the paved road from El Remate , just outside Tikal National Park , are nests of large , colorful birds , oropendolas , a relative of the oriole . About forty nests are clustered together , hanging socks of them , with adult birds coming and going , turning upside down on their branches , their golden tails flashing . Once inside the park , the road north to Uaxactun becomes heavily rutted and muddied . A pair of swallowtail kites , their deeply etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are hovering nearby . This is a loggers ' road . <p> Named by Sylvanus Morley , who excavated the Maya ruins nearby  --  the oldest in Central America  --  Uaxactun was also one of the most important camps for chic-leros , those who harvested chicle , a rubber-like substance used in the manufacture of chewing gum , from the Manilkara zapota tree . Today Uaxactun is a village of about seven hundred people located along either length of an airstrip built for the chicle industry , whose heyday existed from about 1890 to 1970 . The airstrip is now prime soccer field and horse pasture . <p> At the thatched hut that is CONAP 's district office of the Maya Biosphere Reserve a sign says : TABLE <p> Here residents talk of developing a tourist route that would extend north from Tikal as far as the less explored ruins of El Mirador and El Peru ; they speak knowledgeably about what would be needed : supply stores , horses , trained guides . There is now a guide 's course offered their children in the village 's only school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the project 's infrastructure , the community , and the forest itself . <p> They also are exploring ways to derive income from the forest without destroying it , through harvesting plants such as xate , a palm used in floral arrangements , which can be collected year-round , and through chicle , which is harvested September through February , allspice ( pimienta gorda ) , and medicinal plants . <p> Says one young resident of Uaxactun with a family : " We know what is in the forest , what we can extract for income besides chicle and xate , like medicinal plants and pimienta , but someone must help us to extract those things . A chiclero feeding his family is n't going to be able to take off a day to harvest medicinal plants and find a market for it by himself . There must be an organization for this . " <p> In fact , Conservation International ( CI ) , a Washington-based nonprofit environmental organization , has been exploring and promoting the economic benefits of Peten 's nontimber forest products since the late 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program director , a family can earn up to three times the average daily wage by harvesting xate , chicle , and allspice , versus clearing the forest and plant-ing corn or raising cattle . And , to Guatemala as a nation , these renewable resources could represent from four to six million dollars yearly . <p> " A tree is concentrated capital , but you must wait many years to obtain that capital , " says Reining . " On the other hand , nontimber forest products can be collected from year to year , though their unit value is relatively small . These two can work together : the nontimber forest products provide rent on the land while one waits for the trees to mature . These trees then provide a source of concentrated capital that nontimber forest products can not easily provide . " <p> At the island capital of Flores , Lake Peten-Itza is rising , and no one is quite sure why . There are theories : deforestation ; the land bridge built two decades ago to connect Flores to Santa Elena disturbed the lake ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swallows dive toward the lake 's shallows from perches in abandoned buildings on the shore ; as a commuter launch from San Andres passes a tiny outcropping that houses a radio tower , one ca n't help but wonder how much larger the island was a few decades ago , and how much smaller it will be a few decades hence . <p> At CI 's project offices , called Pro-Peten , Carlos Soza , the organization 's in-country director , talks about the importance of determining the carrying capacity of the biosphere  --  the number of tourists it can serve , the numbers of locals , ranchers , farmers , which are all part of the real picture . As for ecotourism , " it 's a process , " he says . " It 's not the final product . But it 's the most direct , quickest way to benefit local people . It 's a part of the picture . " <p> Pro-Peten sponsored artisan workshops with the cooperation of the Soto brothers , who pioneered the handicraft effort in El Remate ; however , says Soza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using cericote wood is fine , because it grows quickly , with a mature tree in eight to eleven years , but cedar grows very slowly and rosul is endangered . <p> Originally , plans for the Maya Biosphere Reserve called for the removal of the residents of the village of El Cruce and further north ; however , they resisted , and CI stepped forward with a plan . They offered to place in the village their flagship factory of potpourri products  --  dried leaves , seeds , barks , and flowers from the forests of Peten , which they would then market . <p> At the small factory , which opened in April 1993 , a group of two men and sixteen women are hand stencilling jicara shells that form the holders for the potpourri . Beyond , on the ground , cones are drying , dozens of shells , their rounded skins baking in the noonday sun . The smell of allspice fills their air of the small shop ; recycled paper for labels is drying in the back ; and natural dyes for leaves are cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this small factory . And another ten people are employed collecting species in the forest . Beside the work area , there is a plan for a shop and quarters where visitors may sleep overnight . There are also plans to process allspice oil on-site . CI is currently building a market for the potpourri and other products to be made at the factory , with the plan to eventually transfer ownership to the community of El Cruce . " The whole point , " says Soza , " is for the people to take over . " <p> Although Peten is no longer isolated , in many ways it is an island still , an island of refuge . And the question remains : Is the Maya Biosphere Reserve the last refuge , or the first successful incorporation of people living sustainably within its borders ? <p> PHOTO : In Guatemala 's Maya Biosphere Reserve residents are becoming pioneers in new techniques of sustainable living . <p> PHOTOS : For Rolando and Manuel Soto , the woodcarvers ' workshop , is just one aspect of living sustainably in Peten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , residents are asking how many ranches and farms the biosphere can support , as they focus on collecting nontimber forest products , such as from the chicle tree , and on developing an ecotourism circuit to Maya ruins north of Tikal , including Uaxactun . <p> PHOTOS : While the town of Flores , shows the effects of Lake Peten Itza 's rising , many Peteneros hope to preserve such views as this one across the lake . <p> By Kathryn Stafford <p> Photographs by Jeffrey Crespi <p> <p> Kathryn Stafford is the English Editor of Americas . <p> TO MARKET ... WITH ECO-CRAFTS <p> Can people live comfortably within a biosphere reserve ? Can both nature and people benefit ? In 1990 , attempting to answer these questions , the Asociacion Mexicana de Artes y Culturas Populares ( Mexican Association of popular Art and Culture-AMACUP ) , based in Mexico City , and Aid to Artisans ( ATA ) , based in Farmington , Connecticut , began developing and promoting artisan products using natural and renewable resources . <p> First working in three widely diverse biosphere reserves in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , trained and organized others . AMACUP has received funding from the OAS for its training workshops in Peten , and from the MacArthur Foundation for programs in Mexico . <p> Marta Turok , president of AMACUP , points to the value of the local market over exports . " New skills combined with logistical bottlenecks and small-scale production can render export an unrealistic goal , even a nightmare , " she says . " Innovation for the local and tourist markets is a perfectly acceptable way of determining a project 's success . " <p> ATA 's Chip Morris advised Conservation International on El Cruce artisan projects , including potpourri ( below ) , currently being marketed within Guatemala through the jewelry store Jades , and tested for U.S. export . <p> Both groups participate in Pro-Peten 's yearly fee providing artisans and training . This ten-day event functions as an artisan workshop , crafts market , and information center . <p> Morris adds : " We 've also set up a storefront museum in Flores , CINCAP Centro de Informacion de la Naturaleza , Cultura , y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biosphere are doing . It 's a model we plan to replicate in the Lacandon jungle and Quintana Roo . " <p> PHOTO : Mexican crafts <p>
