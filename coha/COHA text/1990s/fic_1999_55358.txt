Why was it , Janice thought , that everything took longer than you wanted ? Like life . It was the last day of summer , their last day together , and all the way upstate her mother went on about Cornell  --  the boys she dated , the friends she made  --  going " oh , " and " oh ! " over the radio until Janice 's head went completely blank , buzzed emptily like when she skipped her Mellaril . They 'd eaten at the travel plaza Roy 's ( her mother ridiculously ordering a salad ) , and Janice could still taste her onion rings . Outside the world ran by , bright and hot and sharp as a paper cut . <p> Of course Lonnie had to come , sitting between them on the front seat like a rug , reeking of flea dip and panting so hard his tongue dripped on the carpet . He was old , a cocker with bags under his eyes like someone punched him . Her mother tipped the air-conditioning vent to blow right on him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , even though she knew Janice could n't stand him . He was her father 's dog , except her father 's new wife , Marion , was allergic to his dandruff . Janice had n't liked him before that . He was sneaky , and growled when you cornered him under a bed . When Janice said , " Stupid dog , " her mother dismissed her with a laugh . <p> " But he loves to ride in the car , " she 'd said . " And this way I 'll have company on the way back . " <p> Now they cruised up the Thruway in the slow lane , the Mohawk glittering in the heat . Monday was Labor Day , and traffic was bad , tons of construction . In the fields , cows knelt under scrubby trees . Her mother was going on about Cayuga 's Waters and the bell tower chiming every quarter hour , and Janice concentrated on the radio . <p> They were n't going to her mother 's beautiful Ithaca , just dumb , ugly Utica . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . She 'd missed a large part of senior year after the attempt , and her grades were only good enough for a SUNY . Utica was the farthest one from Bellmore and their empty house , and she accepted bitterly , sure her mother would n't let her go . But she had . Since October , the Mellaril seemed to be working , or that 's what her mother thought . It had been a quiet spring , a quiet summer . There were no episodes . This morning when she opened her pill reminder and ate Sunday 's , Janice wondered if it could be true , that it really was the drugs . <p> It was usually summer when she thought of killing herself , she did n't know why . Something about the long , airless days , the empty streets and hot yards . It had been September last year ; though no one ever said , the anniversary was coming up . It had been a day like today , the sun glinting off the parked cars . She walked through the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached her parents ' room . Her father had been gone for years , but her mother still kept his dresser , inside it a few shirts pressed from the cleaner 's , stiff with cardboard . Janice turned off the air conditioner and let the heat settle before going through the medicine cabinet , choosing . After she took everything , she lay down on her mother 's bed and closed her eyes . It took longer than she 'd thought , and after a few minutes she got up and stood at the window and watched a boy ride by on a three-speed , a baseball glove impaled on his handlebars , the tassels flying from his grips . She was holding on to the gauzy curtain , feeling the grittiness between her fingers . Little waves of heat shivered on top of the cars . She felt she could reach out and pinch the cars between her fingers and squish them like lightning bugs if she wanted to . If she wanted to , but she did n't . She did n't want anything anymore , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to finally say what she meant . The sun felt good on her arms , the stifling air . <p> And then , after she was dead , she woke up with a hose in her mouth , choking on it . The vomit was hot in her nose , and there were faces flying above her , gloved hands , the noise of voices . <p> " There you are , " a doctor said , huge , hovering . " I 'm afraid you ca n't leave us just yet . " <p> And then the questions , the psychiatrists , her father coming back from Seattle to see if she was okay . <p> " I 'm okay , " she said . <p> " No you 're not , " her mother said . <p> Even now Janice had never given her a real explanation for it , or as close to one as she 'd figured out herself . What could she possibly say to justify it ? I 'm lonely . I do n't love anybody . I 'm tired . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're eighteen . You have n't even lived yet . Give it a chance . " <p> And she had . Was n't this proof , today , going off to college like someone normal ? <p> But it 's all fake , Janice thought . It does n't mean anything . <p> She looked down and saw that Lonnie had slobbered on her jeans . " Oh , nice , " she said , and found a napkin on the floor to wipe it off with . Overhead a sign flew by . <p> " What did that say ? " her mother asked . <p> " I did n't see it , I was cleaning up this slobber . " <p> " We must be getting close . See if you can find it on the map . " <p> " Find what ? " <p> " The exit . There must be a number . " <p> " What number was it ? " Janice asked . <p> " I do n't know  --  something . Just find the one we want . " <p> Janice flapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lonnie sighed . <p> " I think that might have been it , " her mother said . <p> It made Janice look up , but there was nothing to see , just a Cadillac passing them . She would have noticed if they were close , she thought . She got the number from the map and folded it away . <p> " I 'm sorry , honey , " her mother said . " It just came up on me too fast . " <p> " It 's all right , " Janice said , and it was . Another hour or two , and she 'd be in her new room , her mother caught in traffic above the city , Lonnie sprawled across the front seat , his head in her lap . All summer Janice had been planning for this , making lists of what to bring , buying soap and deodorant , shampoo , new towels . Now she wanted to enjoy her escape , but the hot car , the dry fields slipping by  --  none of it seemed as sweet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a release . It was still the three of them cruising along in the Buick the same as any road trip , as if they might bypass Utica completely and end up at the cabin at Blue Mountain Lake , her father already there , waiting with a stringer of crappie . It was so bright out , so green , that it seemed like there was a lot of summer left . But no , this was it . <p> " There , " her mother said , and pointed at a sign too far away to read . " What does that one say ? " <p> She slowed , and Janice automatically looked behind them , but there was no one . <p> " What 's it say ? " her mother said . <p> Thirty-one , the sign said . <p> " That 's it , " Janice said . " That 's the one we want . " <p> The ramp took them west into the city , dropped them on Genesee Street . On the map it was the main drag , but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doors boarded over with plywood and posted with sheriff 's notices . Fluff from some tree floated over the road . After being on the highway so long , it seemed like they were crawling . Huge weeds grew in the supermarket lot . The city was deserted , in a park only a boy her age practicing foul shots at a netless backboard . It looked like Hempstead . <p> They climbed a long hill , hitting every red light , and by the top the neighborhood had changed , the buildings giving way to three-deckers , porches strung with laundry . A panel truck missing a wheel sat propped on cinder blocks , its side crowded with graffiti . Still , her mother said nothing . <p> They came upon the gates of the college , two brick pillars with a wrought-iron arch above them . A campus cop in a blaze-orange vest motioned them in , pointed toward the dorms . With every speed bump , Lonnie puffed and grumbled . Since she 'd received the brochure , Janice had gone over the map so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stone dorms was a confusion of minivans and Explorers pulled off onto the grass , and parents unloading trunks and desklamps , plants and stereos . It reminded Janice of the first day of skating camp , all the fathers in Bermuda shorts . Another cop had her mother ease the Buick up over the curb and shut it down . Ahead stretched a small quad , complete with a three-story Gothic bell tower sheathed in ivy . When they 'd come in March , it lay under a foot of snow , the crisscrossed walks carved out by plows . Just like Cornell , her mother said . Now the grass was brown and bare in patches , a scraggly pack of boys playing Ultimate under the bell tower . <p> " It looks very nice , " her mother said . " Do n't you think ? " <p> " Yeah , " Janice said . <p> Her mother set a bowl of water down beneath a tree for Lonnie . He sniffed it and lay down in the shade . They started unloading the trunk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was on the fourth floor . The stairs were marble , and echoed . A sign on her door had her name on it , and her roommate 's : marla ray . She was n't here yet . There was an RA who gave her her keys and helped them bring a load up . Janice had n't wanted to look like a dork in shorts ; now she wished she 'd worn them . So many clothes . Books , her Mac with the little troll who stood on top of the monitor . She did n't remember packing so much stuff . <p> " Which bed do you want to be yours ? " her mother asked when they 'd gotten it all up . <p> " It does n't matter , " Janice said . " We 'll decide when she gets here . " <p> " Is there anything else you need ? " <p> Janice could n't think of anything . She felt like lying down , letting the whole ride up here drain away . <p> " If you do , " her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall there . I took down the number in case I think of anything on the way home . I 'm sure I will . " <p> " Oh , I 'm sure . " <p> Her mother looked at her and tried to smile  --  that smile that said , I 'm trying , will you try , too ? Janice never knew how to react to it . Mostly she froze , tried not to give in to it . It was unfair , her mother asking her that , as if Janice would always disappoint her . Maybe it was true , but why did she always have to do it ? <p> " Are you sure you 're going to be all right ? " her mother said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Okay , " she said , and gave her a hug , a final kiss goodbye . <p> Janice trailed her out the door . Now it was advice time . Get your rest . Eat . Take your medication . When you ddrink  --  because I know you will  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know how things are going . Use the calling card . <p> " I will , " Janice said , already wondering how long she 'd wait . She could see Marla hollering from the pay phone , " It 's your mother again . " <p> On the stairs her mother stopped and looked back at her . " Do you think you 're going to like it here ? " <p> " Yes , " Janice said , maybe too hard , because her mother looked hurt and said , " All right , " softly . <p> Christ , Janice thought , just go . <p> Outside , the quad was filling up with cars , a black lab chasing the Ultimate game . Under the tree where they 'd left Lonnie , the water dish had tipped over . He was gone , nowhere . <p> They both stood on the stoop , shielding their eyes . Besides the lab there was a golden retriever circling a family in a Wagoneer . No Lonnie . <p> " Stupid dog , " Janice said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He ca n't get far . " <p> They split up , each taking a side of the quad , walking toward the bell tower , calling and calling . Her mother could whistle with her fingers so loud it hurt , and people turned to her . Janice asked one of the players  --  a tall guy in a tie-dyed Phish shirt  --  if he 'd seen him . Her mother stopped an RA with a clipboard . Nothing . <p> They headed back to the stoop , calling . Her mother wiped the dish out with a paper towel ; she 'd brought some treats , and she put those in the dish and sat on the stoop , then a minute later walked over to the cop and came back with a phone number . " Just wait here , " she said . <p> Campus safety could n't do much for them . It was a busy day ; most of their people were on traffic or issuing parking permits . They 'd put something out on him , but they were stretched a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do you believe that ? " her mother said . " Honestly . How much are we paying for this ? " <p> It was nearly five now , the sun taking on a soft orange light , like in a commercial . Her mother tossed her keys from hand to hand . She stood up . " Let 's drive around a little and look for him . " <p> " I 'll watch here , " the RA offered . <p> Backing the car onto the road , her mother scraped the tailpipe . " Just great , " she said . " This is just what I need . " <p> Janice navigated with the campus map . Her mother hunched over the wheel , peering down alleys , dead-end parking lots . They went by the observatory , the engineering center , the fieldhouse . It only took half an hour . <p> " Not a very big campus , " her mother said , as if unimpressed . <p> " Maybe he 's back at the dorm , " Janice said . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not leaving till I find him , " she said , and it sounded like a threat , like this was her fault . <p> Back at the dorm , Marla Ray had arrived with her family . She was tall and pretty and wore a print dress , her hair in cornrows . Her father was built like a football star and carried her trunk on his shoulder . Marla 's mother came down  --  the whole family was tall  --  and Janice 's mother introduced herself , explaining about Lonnie running away , waving her keys at the quad . " What a day , " she said , and Janice went upstairs . <p> " Oh no , " Marla said when Janice told her . <p> " I know , " Janice said . " We 've had him for ten years . " <p> Marla 's father was a lawyer ; her mother did n't work but loved to garden . They were from Pittsburgh . <p> " I should go take care of my mom , " Janice said . Marla understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked her . <p> Her mother was still talking with Marla 's , who seemed glad to see Janice . <p> " Well , we should go get Marla settled , " she said . " We have to get back tonight . " <p> " They 're nice , " Janice 's mother said when they were alone . <p> " They are , " Janice conceded . <p> " I 'm going to get a motel room tonight , if that 's all right with you . I think what we should do is put up a flyer around campus . Do you think that 's a good idea ? We can use the number of the phone in your hall , that way people can reach us . Did you bring any pictures of Lonnie , or just pictures he 's in ? " <p> " I 'd have to look , " Janice said , though she knew she had n't . She had n't brought any pictures . Her mother kept a big one of Janice on the mantel in the living room ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center ice in the Coliseum , holding a bouquet of roses , slightly bowing to the crowd . The picture was eight years old . Sometimes she wanted to switch it for one of her in the ER , the doctor shoving the rubber tube down her throat . <p> " Let me go look , " she said . <p> Upstairs she said goodbye to Marla 's parents . <p> " I do n't , " she said when she came down . <p> " That 's all right , " her mother said . " People know what a cocker spaniel looks like , that 's one nice thing about the breed . " <p> They went to Kinko 's , which took forever , then to Wal-Mart to buy a stapler and staples , a roll of double-sided tape . The flyers were fluorescent yellow and said please help find , and then all the information and their number at the bottom . The reward was $100 ; Janice did n't say it was more than Lonnie was worth . They walked around campus in the dusk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to trees , taping them to poles . They 'd made a hundred of them . When they were done , her mother asked if she was hungry . And how about Marla , did Janice think she might like something to eat ? Janice would have to stay and watch the phone in case someone called . <p> " Is your mom okay ? " Marla asked . They 'd chosen beds and were lying there talking . <p> " She 's just upset about Lonnie . And me . Everything . You know . " <p> " I know . " <p> " She 's not going to have anyone to boss around anymore , " Janice said , and thought of the house now , dark , not even the porch light on . That 's what her mother was going back to , and Janice thought of that day last September when it seemed there was no one else in the world except her . The empty streets , the sound of insects all day long . Across the street a sprinkler turned slow arcs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed it like grease between her fingers . And then she was dead , she had left , and that had made her happy . How could she ever hope to explain that to her mother ? It seemed another failure . <p> The phone rang in the hall . She looked to Marla . <p> " It 's got to be for you , " Marla said . <p> It was . It was a frat house . The guy read their address in Bellmore off Lonnie 's tag . <p> " He just wandered in here around dinner . I do n't think he can see very well . " <p> " Where are you ? " Janice asked , and the guy told her . It was all the way across campus ; she knew it from the map . <p> She ran downstairs . Just as she was coming outside , her mother pulled up across the street , the Buick rocking over the curb and onto the grass . Its lights dimmed , and her mother 's door opened . For a second nothing happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse on her shoulder . She leaned in across the seat , then ducked back out with a pizza box , and the purse fell off her shoulder , hit the box , and flipped it so it landed in the grass . <p> From where Janice was standing , she could see her mother sag , her hands cover her face . They were supposed to have split the driving , but at the Roy 's her mother said she was n't tired , and so she drove the whole way . Now she seemed exhausted , kneeling to pick up the box , then plodding across the road with her head down . She was talking to herself , muttering something , and Janice was glad she had good news , that for once she could make her happy , and as she waited , brimming with it , she realized that this was what her mother wanted for her . It was this same concern , this wish to save her from unhappiness that her mother could n't give up . That was love . How helpless she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , not to disappoint her again . <p> " Mom , " she called , " they found him . " <p> " They did ? " Already she was trying to smile for her . <p> " He 's fine . " <p> " Oh , good , " she said , and Janice reached across the pizza box to hug her . She could n't remember the last time she 'd actually wanted to do this , but it seemed right now , natural . She did n't really hate her , she had to know that , did n't she ? <p> Her mother seemed more relieved than happy , and Janice wanted more . But was n't this exactly how her mother felt , always telling her to buck up , to smile ? It was funny how they 'd changed places . <p> " I am happy , " her mother said . " It 's just been a long day . I 'm happy you like it here . " <p> They drove over to the frat and picked up Lonnie . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . The guy did n't want the reward , but her mother insisted , writing a check to the whole house . <p> On the way across campus , her mother said she 'd drive back tonight . She did n't have a reservation yet ; it was n't that far . " And it does n't make sense , " she said . " You want to be with your new friends . " <p> " Are n't you tired ? " Janice asked . <p> " I 'll roll down the windows , that should do it . " <p> She did n't park the car . They said goodbye at the window , Janice leaning in , the pizza box on the roof . Lonnie sniffed the air . <p> " Call me when you get home , " Janice said , " okay ? " <p> " You call me if you need anything , " her mother said . <p> " I will . " <p> They both said I love you , and then Janice lifted the box off the roof and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taillights out the gate and into traffic , headed back through Utica toward the interstate and the city . It was almost night now , the last of sunset dying beyond the quad . Swallows dipped and turned , chittering . The bell tower was lit , and as she paused a minute , breathing in the cool air , the bells chimed , a high , light ringing like Sunday , like the cities in Europe she always wanted to visit , and Janice thought of her mother and what had happened today , how it was a mystery , how it had changed everything between them , and this was the feeling she would remember just a few months later , before her last , successful attempt : how badly she 'd wanted to be happy here , and how it had seemed , for one still and perfect moment , almost possible . <p> <p> By Stewart O'nan <p>
