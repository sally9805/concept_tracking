WHY DID HE keep coming here ? Day after day at the nursing home he stared into this old man 's face , talking and talking , with never a word and seldom a nod in return . <p> Besides , he was anxious to leave this town . Did n't he hate it ? He had always hated it . All his life , when he could , he had avoided it , visiting his mother summers for long spells at the Long Island place rather than coming to Bristol . He was born , grew up here . He thought of his experience here as a long blight which had left an invisible scar . He thought of the town as a scar on the map of Rhode Island . His cheek burned when he thought of it long enough . <p> But , though his mother was buried , he could n't leave town yet . He must unload the house and put it up for sale . He had spent a day with the antique jewelry dealer , he had had two afternoons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to pick over and haggle , vultures seeking a steal or a giveaway . He had packed what he wanted shipped to his own house . He would leave some things for the new owner to use or dispose of . He had final payments and cutoffs to arrange . <p> When he had shown up at the nursing home so soon after his mother 's funeral , the familiar nurses , aides , administrators had been somewhat mystified . There was a preliminary startled look on their faces , then an interval 's silence , then the recuperated presence , smiles warm and friendly , a so-glad-you're-here , but with questions in their eyes for his unasked response . <p> The old man ? He had had to describe the robust old Italian , the silent drifter from the other wing , the side where the healthy , mobile residents lived . His mother had been in a wheelchair , with the incapacitated , of course . <p> Ah , Vittorio . <p> Yes . <p> Balzano . <p> Yes , Mr. Balzano . <p> They had smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not Vittorio , he was not Vittorio for them , he could not be Vittorio to them . He was in fact Mr. Vittorio Balzano , and each day when he located him  --  in his room or a lounge or the dining hall or rec room , perhaps standing staring out a window at the harbor  --  and addressed him as Mr. Balzano , the man turned , enlivened , his eyes flicked alert , a fine rousing in his motions re-formed his body , he sat straighter in his chair or stood taller , as if there were some recognition  --  of what ?  --  and some connection  --  with whom ? You see ? he wanted to say to the aides . And when he heard them talking to the residents  --  Ed , kiss your wife good-bye , kiss her , Ed . Now take your hands out of Al 's plate , Mary . Alvin , you can sit up straight , use your feet  --  push , push  --  Do n't ! he wanted to shout at all those presumptuous mothers . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died , his stepfather , because he was so heavy , had added a second mattress , much too high for her . From the bedroom she had dragged herself across the living room floor and through the sun porch to the front door . Luckily , children were just leaving for school and she cried out , Get help . In no time the ambulance came and took her to the hospital . <p> He told Mr. Balzano , The little woman I came to see every day , you know her  --  Ruth , Ruth Balsam . Mr. Balzano would wander through her wing , stand and stare or meander among the still ones and then wander back to his wing . He was sure Mr. Balzano would remember his mother-and him from his visits ; so he had begun by talking of her as a point of contact , some recognition , to work back from . <p> Work back ? <p> Yes . But he did not begin with his mother 's death . No , he merely told Mr. Balmno she had been brought here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spell in the hospital , but after she had gone home and fallen again when the aide was out in the yard hanging some wash on the line . It was then , having lost some memory , incontinent and in need of more than one person to lift and change and attend her , that she had come here , you see . And from here she had gone home , you see . But he did not say to her permanent home . Here , they were removed almost unnoticed , most often at night-to the hospital , they explained , to stave off the un-stavable shadow which was ever waiting behind doors , outside bedroom windows , in closets , whom their savior the doctor , on his rare visits , might exorcise or excommunicate . So he did not tell Mr. Balzano that she had been taken in dark to the hospital and one morning at three A.M. , very peacefully , had died . Spring . The twenty-fifth . Almost May . You could see the forsythia breaking into still yellow fountains everywhere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if no more snow would come , it was such an unusually balmy April . <p> But Mr. Balzano 's eyes went blank . Did he see the hollow in his eyes , too ? Mr. Balzano must have encountered endless space in his daily travels through the two wings . What must he look like to Mr. Balzano  --  an aging man twenty , twenty-five years younger than he , a stranger , a successful painter home from Europe , a Spanish resident , who now sought him out afternoons  --  relentlessly , yes , who sat relentlessly facing him , who stared relentlessly into his eyes and talked as if he pursued him out of some kind of passion  --  hate , say-because he was propelled by something akin to hatred , a hatred for the town released by his return here and aroused by his mother 's decay and death . He had fixed his emotion on Mr. Balzano the first time he had seen him ; something indeterminate in Mr. Balzano , something even familiar , attracted him against his will , precisely because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he told Mr. Balzano , he had discovered himself . All his art training had led him to the Prado , and though in early years he had had great teachers in the United States and Paris and Oslo and Rome , it was not until he had lived daily in the paintings of Fra Angelico , Bosch , El Greco , Titian , Velzquez , Goya  --  oh , yes , especially Goya  --  that he had painted his way out of his own labyrinth into the world  --  yours , Mr. Balzano  --  found his way to confront the suffering of the world by painting the victims of the world 's cruelty with a compassion equal to the world 's hatred , with a respect for the terror and beauty o the irrational in him  --  in us , Mr. Balzano  --  who could hate , too . He had a reputation , he was famous , his paintings hung in museums all over the world , and magazines everywhere featured color spreads and interpretations of his work . Anyone could see in his own black paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men live and move by madness , he knew madness provokes reason , and reason is the hand that calms the waters . <p> Oh , he was not boasting  --  he did not mean to boast  --  he merely wanted Mr. Balzano bit by bit to understand , he must make Mr. Balzano understand because something in Mr. Balzano the instant he had seen him had compelled . Yes . Leaving the nursing home the first day he had visited his mother , going along the corridor , he came to the rec room ; the sun was burning on the sea , blazed over the floor , the air itself turned light , his vision blurred , and when it settled , that lone man stood there like a dark thing risen from the sea . The sight blunted . He confronted that face . The man stared back . Locked . But what gripped ? what recognition ? <p> He felt wrenched . The man had no right Bewildered , he wanted to strike , he wanted to clutch <p> Now he recalled how all he had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town seemed to rush up and center on that figure . <p> That face , after he had left the nursing home , kept materializing , goading , you could say . He had sat in that house bereft of his mother . Astonishingly , he was not alone  --  the face insinuated , he saw it , the face filled hollows . At times the man emerged and confronted him as if urging him to speak , and then at his own will went back inside him . He did not seem to have any control over Mr. Balzano 's appearances . Was there a current , then , between them  --  maybe even apart from them  --  in which something of him and Mr. Balzano was transmitted from one to the other so that he , too , materialized in Mr. Balzano 's vision ? At what point , he wondered now , had Mr. Balzano first really appeared in his vision ? Perhaps that curiosity , yes , had motivated him against his will to go back to the nursing home almost immediately after the funeral , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But famous ? From the beginning his teachers had said he possessed a touch of genius . But it was not that , no . Millions have a touch of genius , any observer could note that . In fact , to be honest with himself , his touch of genius was a small talent , but obsession fed , nurtured , matured it . He knew as he painted that he must work-incessantly . He would like to have said to Mr. Balzano , I can hear my grandfather saying , Work for the night is coming in which no man can work . Each time my grandfather said it I saw the dark like a solid wall against which I would be obliterated . But he did not want to evoke for Mr. Balzano that image of death . <p> Yet he was convinced  --  and he could tell this to Mr. Balzano  --  that an emotion akin to hatred had driven him to fame  --  oh , not hatred for any-body  --  or was he belying himself and revealing that he had n't quite been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what was in us all , and in him deeply . And had n't he at once felt a similar emotion for Mr. Balzano when he had stared for the first time closely into his face ? If not , why would he have acted on that impulse ? Why would he have been so overwhelmed that he must now find words for it ? After all , he had spent all his life trying to paint the unsayable , he was trying to paint it still , he would go on trying , so why try to articulate it in words ? <p> Mr. Balzano stared , green dark eyes which mirrored all light , caught sea and distance and all objects , still , too still . He had stared into such stillness in the eyes of snakes , rabbits , praying manrises , gulls , and into his own seething in mirrors . His body , old as it was , looked steely with the stillness of trapped energy that seethed . There is madness in us , Mr. Balzano , sometimes you have to yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , shape it . Even Mr. Balzano 's thick gray hair and thick brows and lashes still dark implied lusty energy , his worn face with high cheekbones and firm jaw seemed stone , the neat mustache and brief beard compelled you to a mouth youthfully full but which would not speak . <p> He had been a millworker and a carpenter on the side , Mrs. Beaufort , the daytime administrator said , and his wife had worked in the mill , too , until she died , and his son till the son had been killed in a machine accident . Mr. Balzano had raged . He would stand in the street and clench his fists and flail his arms and rage . Nobody ever knew when the fit would seize him . Something miraculous had happened , or simply one day he had accepted it . A thing in him had died or frozen . He had become docile , harmless . Finally they had brought him here . <p> So Mr. Balzano was one of the horde of immigrants who had come to this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and back of town to Metacorn Avenue , then a neighborhood almost hidden from sight of the Americans . Of course , in his daily life , the workers who poured in and out of the cotton and woolen mill and the U.S. Rubber and the lace factory , Wops and Portygees , were beneath him , lower really than the potato famine Irish Catholics , and the Kanucks and Polacks that settled almost in equally divided areas on either side of Main Street in the next town on the bus route to Providence and whose churches were latecomers to the assemblage of Methodist Episcopal Baptist Presbyterian Congregational Unitarian . So when the myriad young Mr. Balzanos from the Mediterranean settled here , they were carefully pinned with such phrases as his mother herself used so naturally : Is n't he dark-complected ? <p> But in the mirror he was , he saw . Like your father , his mother murmured . She had divorced him , but his father 's image persisted in him . And the secret , silent  --  or inadmissible-was where it had come from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not from her family , oh no . <p> Because of the divorce , he did not know his father 's side , they were a mystery . Imagine he must . But others hinted , implied , Portuguese kids he knew , or friends his mother had , the Portuguese girls Dotty and Mary , who had loved wheeling him in the baby carriage and who had adored his green , deep eyes and long , long , dark lashes and dark hair , his distinguishing marks in a family of blue- and gray-eyed strawberry blondes , towheads as children , who customarily turned lovely chestnut as adults  --  but not dark . In school the question began to come : Are you ? He would shun it . No . English he was . American . Others  --  grown-ups  --  were sure : He is . I knew his grandmother , all his father 's people . Portygeel Older , he buttressed himself . He ignored kids , adults , but burned . <p> In the Block , when he lived in a third-floor tenement , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior high , we need to live on a better street . The Portuguese man across the hall , Marion , he dreaded to meet on the second or third-floor flights because Marion would halt , stare . And he would stare back like pinned prey . Marion 's eyes were hands that might beat or caress . He did not yet know he wanted them to beat or caress . That would break the hold . And though Marion never said a word , his voice was loud across the hall as he said to his wife , The little PortygeeI But safe behind the kitchen door , he 'd let out his breath at last . He would hear Mrs. Stevens the fortuneteller open her door below and be in on it , too . Why , Mrs. Stevens asked his mother frequently , does he whistle all the time ? He never stops whistling going up the stairs . Is the kid nervous or something ? She would stick her head out as he passed her door . You stop that whistlingl The sound must have marred her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But behind the door , . already he was anticipating the next time Marion would appear , afraid one day Marion would touch him , oh God Jesus , and he would be what he was , Portygee to Portygee . He desired to know what it was his mother kept saying he was not , what that bit of blood meant . He would later rationalize . He would figure out from the generational marriages in his father 's family that his grandmother  --  Silva , her maiden name-must have been one-fourth Portuguese , say , and he onesixteenth , next to nothing . Would his people never stop lying ? Would he ? Could he one day know and tell the truth ? It loomed . It loomed in Marion . <p> You see , Mr. Balzano , part of me should have lived up there back of town with you , all of you . A man should not be part here , part there . A man should be everywhere . His mother and his minister and his teachers taught that , but over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us . <p> Listen , Mr. Balzano , I was forty-two before I tasted mussels . Do you know why ? Because people said , the Americans said , mussels and periwinkles were immigrant food , said only Wops and Portygees followed the shoreline hunting periwinkles and mussels . That year I went to northwest Spain . I was tracing the legend of St. James 's journey through Galicia . In every village and hamlet , in the cities , Santiago , La Corufia , not a meal was served without mussels-hot , cold , in soups , salads , stews , sauces . De . liciousI Incrediblel And in the harbor of La Corufia the ships in from sea were burdened with mussels by the thousands hanging in stalks like bananas , great dumps of black and purplish natural jewels stark in the sun ; they confronted me like secret sins fattened and dredged up to eat my way back through . The mind stumbles , dragging such obstacles . You make me eat memory , Mr. Balmno , swallow it . <p> You see , in the Block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights , on our very floor . My mother was not of them because her family had come from three centuries of landed gentry , yes  --  oh , money earned and amounted , then inherited and divided , then lost , so only land remained , plenty of that  --  property poor they became , landed gentry , or swamp Yankees . They did n't get over that  --  or let me . But the Army Air Force taught me in a day , and the Bomb proved forever , that we 're all immigrants , yes , you and I , Mr. Balzano , and snakes roaches dogs cats alligators bats butterflies all insects all green-a universe of immigrants , Mr. Balzano . <p> So why should his mother want to keep moving away from them ? For him . Mr. Balzano must have known , living with the Latins back of town in that pretty section , where they had duplicated the houses and the naked earth of their homelands , Portugal , the Azores , Italy , Sicily , in pink and rose and blue and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string for peppers to climb , and Italian tomatoes for sauce , rows of endive , fennel , string beans ; where men in black with black berets played their games of bocci on the hard ground . Closer to town were the block on block of three-story , threefamily houses , and tenements . Three streets ran like parallel arteries from end to end of town , a block between each , but socially they were miles and dollars and blood apart . That journey from back of Wood Street to High Street to Hope Street , from the rear of town to the bright vista of the harbor , some made in years , or a lifetime , or never . By a fluke  --  magic to his mother  --  one of the Darlings distantly related by marriage rented her a historic house . It sat on the high bank of Hope Street , serene , beautiful , with a view , the slope and trees concealing Thames Street below with the mill , bars , the railroad station , the government dock , piers . All time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices his miracle mother achieved it , he would never know . But she placed him  --  a lie , but placed . They were part of the view . The harbor , islands , infinity were his gift : freedom . <p> Did you know freedom , Mr. Balzano , when you got off that ship from Sicily and touched ground ? How immigrants kissed the earth in Bristol on the Fourth of July Did you ? Did the vision of Liberty , Ellis Island , that skyscraper city stagger ? And did it tarnish with Rhode Island , this town , the mill , the harbor outside the window ... ? <p> Do you dream of the Mediterranean , Mr. Balmno ? <p> Before and after visits to the nursing home , nonchalantly he asked questions of Mrs. Beaufort , or whoever was at the desk , or a drifting aide or one of the permanent residents , who were always eager for an eye a mouth a hand : Nobody ever comes to see Mr. Balzano ? He 'd lived on Rosita Avenue , you say ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Brothers , you say , a cousin ? They 'd died thetel Are there no compatriots here from his hometown in Sicily ? Not a living soul . Mr. Balzano had worked day and night to send money to Sicily , and he 'd saved  --  for the son . The wife , you never saw ? Oh , yes , on the way home from the mill , a short woman , dark , in black , always mourning someone back there . She 'd worked , like her husband , for the son . <p> Oh , Vittorio 's the best , no trouble at all . The aides talked to him , sailed around him , touched the old shoulder . <p> After the second visit to Mr. Balzano , he dreaded going back to his mother 's empty house , his . He found himself moving up Franklin Street to Wood to Rosita Avenue . On some few trees , early shoots were forming , but Mr. Balzano 's neighborhood was still waste , winterstripped , dry . Number fourteen . A small beige stucco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The usual arbor  --  for grapes , shade , gossip , and propping up the wooden frames with starched lace curtains stretched on pins to stiffen in the sun . Last summer 's garden in dead rows , twigs in the ground , untouched . A wooden shed . No garage . Only the American link fence  --  no , not for dogs ; like Sicily , no dogs here , only pariahs , food cost . <p> He dared approach Mr. Balzano 's neighbors . The new one had not known him , but in the house on the right , Orazio Venturi , old too , led him into that typical Latin dark , the parlor shades drawn as if warding off the forever-threatening Sicilian sun . Venturi talked Italo-American , told him of the young Balzano  --  the good-looker who caroused years till he met Giuseppina of the iron hand , who handled him and the money and the son , especially after Balzano 's mother and the older brother died in Sicily  --  make-a him serious , change-a him . So he and Giuseppina were like mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel of land they and the son dosed the world out , but marched  --  religious Giuseppina was  --  to six-o'clock Mass every morning at Our Lady of Mount Carmel , weekdays straight to the mill after Mass , a ritual Vittorio stopped the day she died . After , he never came much out of the house , that Balzano , and after the son was killed turned erernitaggio , a hermit not even looking for another Giuseppina , though for a while women came with food , wanted to clean , wanted that man , a ring , his bed , the house , but quick they learned he was for nobody , he was for the dead , he was dead . <p> But was he ? <p> Was there nothing in this town for Mr. Balmno ? Nothing ? <p> Well , he would know . <p> All he had in his pocket was an old envelope , but he made a sketch of Mr. Balzano 's house . <p> The next afternoon he said , Mr. Balzano , I 've brought you something  --  they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , a woman wheeling by halted . He laid the envelope down before him . The woman moaned . <p> Mr. Balzano gazed at it , long , long . Without shifting his head , he raised his eyes to him , then gazed down . Was there some connection Mr. Balzano was trying to make between him and the sketch ? He said , Ven-turi is still next door , and his brother Dino , and the brother 's wife , Lucia , though I did n't meet them . He still carves canes with wolves ' heads . You remember ? <p> Mr. Balzano 's eyes left the sketch . They would not settle anywhere . <p> But he whispered ! <p> Casa ? Did he whisper Casa ? <p> A word . The first true sound . A word . He vibrated with it . Not to prod , he rose . But the word had sprung between them as binding as the Mount Hope Bridge between Bristol and Portsmouth . He felt almost a malicious pleasure , yes , in feeling he could rouse memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Balzano , because . . . But perhaps he had no choice , perhaps something in him chose Mr. Balzano , perhaps something in Mr. Balzano chose him . He felt the sudden energy of the vengeful . He would enter Mr. Balzano . He would make Mr. Balzano spill . <p> When he left , he spent the rest of the afternoon and evening making quick line sketches of the Common with the Courthouse , the bandstand , the grade schools . He sketched the old Prudence Island ferry , the mill , the U.S. Rubber Company , our Lady of Mount Carmel , the Mount Hope Bridge , the castle at Poppasquash Point . Surely Mr. Balmno would recognize them . He would make the town surround him . <p> The next afternoon Mrs. Beaufort said , All day he 's stayed cooped up in his room , no breakfast , no lunch , that 's not lihe him . Her eyes lingered . Was she admonishing him ? <p> Mr. Balzano was sitting on the edge of a plain wooden chair . Standing on the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one , starting with a view of the ferry under the bridge . You remember , Mr. Balmno , where the kids parked to make love , it was famous for that . He laughed , a little excited himself , yes , because Mr. Balzano 's gaze did not once leave the sketch-the sketches . Slowly he took him through the others . Not to press too much too fast on him , he related anecdotes , brief histories : how , for example , luck saved one of the construction crew from falling to his death  --  that day the notorious Tonio Tedeschi sported birthday galluses as a joke , yes , but when he tripped and fell , they caught on a crossbeam and he swung there high over Narragansett Bay . How Mr. Balzano studied the milli And he cocked his head when he said , This is my house on Hope Street , not far from here . You must know it , Mr. Balzano . I finally bought it for my mother . And he ended with the U.S. Rubber with its gigantic brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooted so loudly that the ground seemed to tremble with an ejaculation . You could hear the whistle in all directions from the ferry to the reaches of the Neck and to Mount Hope and over the waters of the harbor . What could he call that sound-time ? doom ? - relentless , pressing him to work , work for the night is coming . His finger touched the smokestack in the sketch . You heard the five o'clock whistle . All my life I 've been hearing it , Mr. Balzano . The sound 's in both of us . Do you hear it now ? <p> Mr. Balzano looked up abruptly , his eyes widened . He was startled at the eyes so like his own , deep green , with brown and dark little islands , and tiny planets deep in space . Then his eyes , all chaos , darted from sketch to sketch . His fingers quivered , touched , righted , touched . He waited , wanting words , but only deep sounds came , muted bowel grumbles which merely caused his lips to quiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balzano 's hands shot out and possessed the sketches , his face defiant . <p> They 're yours , Mr. Balzano . To relax him , he laughed . I made them for you . It 's your town . <p> And mine , he thought . I 'll never see it again . Never . The house would be in the hands of his agent , Ray Boggs , and the family lawyer , Calvin Martin , so he would not have to return , ever . Thank God . But the joy was sharp , it pained . Never . That tolled . In the pit of him he felt a sinking , loss . Blood lamented . Why ? when he hated the town  --  he did . <p> The day  --  it was still early  --  was so beautiful ; and he had not , no , not seen the town  --  he 'd sketched it from memory-had not seen Mr. Balzano 's world or ... his own . Had he deliberately avoided those streets , avoided facing those houses he had lived in on Woodlawn Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane ? Why ? He would ask Mr. Balzano that question . Of course Mr. Balzano would n't answer  --  he might , there was that hope  --  but was n't silence a reply ? Silence would make him answer himself . Or he would be left with this passion of all his life that erupted in his compassion for those sufferers . If he could show Mr. Balzano his paintings , he would n't have to speak . Have to ? But he did have to . From the moment he had confronted Mr. Balzano 's face in that blaze of sun in the rec room , he knew they were standing alone bound in a silence as deep as the bottom of a sea . <p> Once he had begun to walk down those streets , he felt led , impelled . And so quickly had he developed the habit of Mr. Balzano 's presence that he was already whispering to him , sometimes quite loud , preparing himself for his session in that room , that box , where Mr. Balzano would sit in his old world erectness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? <p> He took the streets as they were laid out from the farthest edge of town bordering the harbor , where once the brook from Mount Hope had run through his yard past the green cottage he 'd been born in and under a bridge over the road , through the meadow across the street and to the harbor . The lower meadow was a great swamp with hundreds of wild purple iris , the higher a mass of rock outcrops surrounded by great meanders of pink and blue and white forget-me-nots . Alone , I played there , Mr. Balzano , it was all the world to me , the woods were dark and deep , I went deep in , I knew those woods  --  there was nothing to fear in that dark , I could have been a great lunar moth , I was the bark it clung to in daytime , I was snapdragons , I was the garter snakes I turned rocks to find and carry in my pockets , and trapdoor spiders , and moles and beavers and all the animals we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the peak of the Mount , I could touch sky , on one side I could hold the whole harbor in my hand and the whole bay on the other or cup my hands around the enchanted city of Fall River on the far shore .... <p> That house was as far away from yours on the opposite side of town as could be , Mr. Balzano <p> Well , I went to Woodlawn <p> It was gone ! No house , no brook , no meadow , the woods cut back . Only houses and houses and houses stood there . But in my head I saw that boy and the house , brook , meadow , woods . <p> Had I imagined him , Mr. Balzano ? Was the boy I saw never really the one who loved to play in the brook and catch tadpoles in jars , only  --  infallibly  --  to be shoved into the water from behind by the bullies from the next block , his head pressed into the silt till he could no longer breathe and , when released , jerked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find nobody was ever in sight they were that fast . He grew almost afraid to go into the brook , but , stubborn , he did , each time thinking , I 'll get even , I 'll spy them out , I 'll dare them , yet always he ended up soaked , muddy , crying-but more and more crying not from shame but fury . We moved from that green house . When you were a divorced woman , you moved . Divorce was a thing unheard of in your Catholic world then , Mr. Balzano . Oh , my mother was independent , self-supporting , valiant . And then poor came to mean , and class showed , the boy was left alone and vulnerable , and diCerent came to mean , and as he grew Portygee came to mean .

Always any change of weather , lingering snow and slush , damp harbor air drove his bronchials mad . He had to sit still from wheezing , watch the other kids playing vigorously , years of that inactivity . Asthma , the doctors said , but only one , Dr. Bernardo  --  your compatriot , Mr. Bal-zano  --  diagnosed bronchial trouble , said , The boy will outgrow it in his teens . At fifteen he did , good strong lungs till this day , Mr. Balzano . In fact , those torturous breathings made his lungs strong .

He would n't tell his mother because she would deflate with a kind of exhaustion  --  he could see her now , poor woman  --  and then inflate with fury at that woman . <p> But his loves saved him  --  books , pens , brushes turned him to the hammock under the apricot tree . Eric , the young gym teacher next door , loved kids . He must have felt sorry for him because he sometimes came into his yard and played  --  threw passes with him , boxed lightly , wrestled . Such activity thrilled him . He laughed , excited . His blood surged . The world beat .

Later the Catholic kids would say , That 's why you go to church . Every Saturday they had to tell what they 'd done that week . Four son did , did n't he , Mr. Balzano ? But in his church , he could n't , there was no priest to pave the way to God , there was no way to know if He heard . Besides , tell what ? <p> And on Burton Street he knew the word queer . He associated the word with that time , with the pinochle and poker friends of his mother and stepfather , the Portuguese girls Dorothy and Mary , who loved to come make chocolate fudge for him , but especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a defect which " spoiled his chances " for marriage , they always said after Cooney had left . Poor Cooney . So for him Burton Street was the sound of Poor Cooney and the sight of Cooney 's enormously thick sole which would grow in his mind and thought over the years like his grandfather 's hands burned in an accident at sea till they were nothing but claws , hard bone wrenched back in such distortion that they were the perfect image of crouched spiders . But what miracles those hands performed ! Independent , his grandfather had built his own house , every inch ; he 'd repaired broken toys , bikes , vehicles , saving them to distribute to poor kids at Christmas , and he poorer than any of them , a scavenger hunting for others . He 'd collected his due from the State , he 'd earned his keep with his daughter . <p> Burton Street was also where Randy Wills , one of the older big boys in the neighborhood , grabbed his hand and tickled his palm with his finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped a foot higher and lashed his unathletic , untrained fist out , his sudden Samson strength struck  --  and Randy fell . He could n't believe it . He was trembling . Across the street Randy 's gang was watching , ready to ride him with names , but they went dead still , then broke into murmurs and cries . The bully ran . But he  --  never till that moment had he known physical triumph . He was giddy , but scared . He could scarcely walk to the house . At school his reputation rose , respect set in  --  but not for long . He soon learned how short memory is , how fickle the world . <p> And years later Burton Street meant Beatrice Friedman , the dark Jewish beauty of the high school class . Gaga over her , he 'd walk her home . But you did n't go in ? his mother probed . She ca n't let any of us in , he said . <p> All my life , Mr. Balzano , I 've seen Cooney 's shoe , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've painted parts . In the paintings the bodies , the parts , are composed of tendrils trying to reach , reach , and touch other parts . Rains of blood are falling on them , Mr. Balzano , they struggle to keep from drowning in rains of blood , the tendrils are hands in the blood , Mr. Balzano , they reach for the light , they try to grip other tendrils to keep from drowning . Some of the paintings are masses of tendrils feeling blindly , but a few , a few tendrils have developed eyes , yes , and the eyes mirror the others , yes , the eyes are . the only place they can hold the others inside . <p> Sometimes the painting is a portrait , but when you go close , you see the face is a complex of tendrils , each separate , loose , turned outward . He could be you , Mr. Balzano ; me , Mr. Balzano <p> Then he went to Wood Street . Wood Street was The Block , Mr. Balzano , ten families in tenements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world lived there , Mr. Balzano  --  Italian Portuguese Irish Polish English Catholic Protestant but no Jew oh no  --  and Marion stared at me on the stairs , Mrs. Stevens the fortuneteller lay in wait to shout , Stop the whistling ! The house was full of sounds , languages I could n't understand , but I could understand the yelling , arguing , laughing , fighting , singing , playing . Years I lived there , Mr. Balzano , where shame came to mean . Always shame will be the little girl , Lucia , and the boy beginning to turn man . Her mother and father were out one day , alone in the house , sudden it was , we felt-we were  --  curious , or I was . We went into a dark closet , between clothes smelling of grease , cigarette , soap . Behind the shut door in dark I pushed her panties aside , my hand fumbled , my thing tried to know her cleft , behind the shut door in dark . I was dumb , innocent , curious  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight . After , in daytime we avoided each other . I avoided even Lucia 's glance , remembering how scared I was when she pushed my hand away and cried No no and shoved the door open and ran . <p> Mornings and afternoons , Mr. Balzano , as that boy grew into junior high and high , he met every day the Japanese girl , walked her to and from school . Under alien eyes they walked , and all The Block , all the scorned ones in the block , poor and immigrant and laborers , scorned the only Jap in town . Even before the war , Mr. Balzano , before Mussolini and Hitler and Hirohito , bastard came to mean , yes , because she was illegitimate , and in those days her unwed mother was stained branded shunned so the daughter was , too , ignored , scorned abused sometimes stoned , yes , till she and I stoned them . <p> In high school the boys would not let up on small . He was smaller than most , short , though formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Russo said , The guys say you got a big cock , and whipped his towel back . But the respect did n't last long . Two star athletes . cornered him in the athletic ground behind the high school . One jammed him against a post , his collar caught up against his windpipe , he could hardly breathe . Starting tomorrow you bring two extra sandwiches in your lunch every day , see ? His mother said , He 's developed an appetite like a horse , he must be growing . And shamed , thinking of her , what she did without for him , coward came to mean . Seeing himself in the bathroom mirror , Coward he accused himself . At noon they met him on the basement stairs . Well ? He said , Bring your own sandwiches and stared them down . You little fucker ! He turned and walked away , slow . He took the sandwiches home . Ma , save them for tomorrow . <p> Last , he went to Shaw 's Lane . It was dusk , fast darkening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a corner . It looked unfamiliar , but it was all he could do to press back a threat . He closed his eyes . A dark building materialized , snow , a sled-No . Shame pulsed at his temples . His cheek burned . No . He stood against memory . <p> Tomorrow ... <p> But tomorrow  --  he felt somewhat apprehensive as he thought it-would be his last day with Mr. Balzano . <p> The moment he entered  --  as if they were waiting , watching for him an aide intercepted to tell him the administrator would like to see him . Mrs. Beaufort ? Oh , no , Mr. Cranston . And Mr. Cranston assured , We 're delighted , of course , at the attention you 've given Mr. Balzano ; for years not a soul has come except the charities , volunteers . He sat suspended in the long hiatus as Mr. Cranston looked out on sea , sky . There 's so much in a person , we never know how much the least suggestion will release . Once long ago Mr. Balzano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cranston , he 's been docile , too docile . I 'd like him to react . But he has , Mr. Cranston said . Has ? Yes . There was an almost edge to his voice . Mr. Balzano has been talking almost unceasingly in his room , Italian , but we do n't know what because the instant anyone opens the door he stops , and when it 's left open he closes it . Mr. Balzano seems to depend ... After you left , he walked up and down the corridors , his hands going as if they were doing the talking he did n't do , he circled the rec room , entered sickrooms , stood staring at people , circled and circled . He was all motion . He kept at it . We thought maybe it would help us to know if there 's something , some subject , a word  --  you 'd have to be judge  --  that may upset him ... ? Mr. Cranston , I ca n't place a particular ... And besides , today is my last visit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say last  --  But , he said , then he might expect  --  Oh  --  Mr. Cranston rose  --  here they expect many things we do n't know . If we could know  --  Well , forgive my troubling you , we 're always concerned about our guests , and you 've been such a blessing to Mr. Balzano . He extended his hand . Have a good visit , and a good trip . <p> Talking . Mr. Balzano ? <p> And circling ? <p> Was Mr. Balzano wating for him ? His visits were a precise clockwork ritual . Had Mr. Balzano 's body come to expect him now ? <p> The door was shut . He halted in the corridor . Inside , there was a voice , a bass chafing sound , but it ceased  --  at his steps ? his shadow under the door ? <p> He himself was in tumult stirred by yesterday 's walk back into that time , to those houses , by the long night of reliving a thousand associations that crowded unsorted unordered unimpeded . He had n't slept . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Balzano was sitting on the bed , still as a priest , dark against the light . His lips were parted as if caught with a half-mouthed word . And he was sure Mr. Balzano had not slept either  --  his eyes were red cauldrons , and the lids red . Now they fixed on him , barely blinked . Almost he could not bear that gaze today . <p> The sun penetrated , so bright it pained . He dosed his eyes . <p> If he were sitting in Mr. Balzano 's place on that bed , who would come ? <p> Mr. Balzano ... <p> He sank onto the edge of the chair . Looking up , he felt like some acolyte before that unyielding face . In the air he sensed the lingering of the bass voice . <p> How familiar this place had become in these last days . Already he felt the wrench of breaking this new habit before he had reached Mr. Balzano . For he had not touched Mr. Balzano . Yet had n't he  --  yes , he saw it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expected , what he wanted , what he wanted from Mr. Balzano , but all week he 'd felt himself inching toward him as if he had sent out invisible fingers to feel into his mouth , throat , down , down , fine tendrils that wanted to touch , grip  --  what ? <p> What am I doing here ? he thought . <p> He said , What are we doing here , Mr. Balzano ? <p> He wanted to tell him , This is the last day . Strange , is n't it , how you creep to lasts and then they are sudden and then over , and so many . But he said , Yesterday I went to all the houses I 'd lived in , Mr. Balzano . I think I went because I 'd made the sketches to take you back to town ... or because I started thinking ... or because my blood ... because ... because I was impelled  --  you know  --  as if I had no control over my feet , I had to go where they led . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn , yes , just as I was when I saw across the rec room , standing there alone  --  you , Mr. Balzano . <p> Do you long to be what you hate ? Do you long to be the rock and dust of Sicily ? <p> He stared at Mr. Balzano 's hands . He said , I went first to the house ! was born in , back to that natural world  --  Oh , Mr. Balzano , how far back do you have to go to be happy ? I loved the woods and meadows , wild rab : bits insects snakes  --  Telling it , he felt such joy fountain in him , he was so at one with that vanished time and place , that he broke into bastard Italian  --  nei boschi , he said , with le lepri , insetti , i serpenti , he said . Why had n't it occurred to him before ? He had n't spoken a word of Italian since talking bastard half-Spanish half-Italian while painting in Civita-vecchia and by the walls of Tarquinia , looking out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balzano 's Sicilia . And he could n't stop now . Listen , Mr. Balzano , you know The Block , I bet you knew the Romanos and the Chiricos and the Brazzis  --  Those names and his butchered Italian fascinated Mr. Balzano . His eyes quivered , made hummingbird darts , his fingers were restless though his hands stayed , but mostly his lips worked , mouthing his words silently . <p> No , he could n't stop now . He told yesterday , ieri . He told that house and brook and meadow and the woods ; told all the families in The Block ; told Marion halting on the stairs to stare at him as he came up from the cellar with the bottle of oil for the kitchen stove , Mrs. Stevens the fortune-teller , and Lucia , poverettal ; told Cottage Street and Eric and small and puny , piccolo e infertoo ; told Burton Street and Cooney 's clumped foot and beating Randy Wills ; told junior high and high and Portygee and strambo , queer ; told how one day when his mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door , trying to lure him with his corpo celino , le labbra tumide , his voice sussurando that he had a little shack in his yard , nobody 'd see them , it 'd be fine , but he streaked through the door up three flights , peered out the hall window to see if Harold Josephine had gone ; told jacking off in the barn behind The Block in shafts of sunlight pouring into the semi-dark through broken windows while pigeons cooed on the rafters ; told his mother 's saying , If I ever catch you playing with yourself , I 'll burn your fingers , bruciarsi le dita ; he told his kid fear of Catholic incense and chants and excommunication ; told Jap-hate and queer-hate and Wop- and Portygee-hate and welfare-hate and his own hate for the town  --  mine and yours , Mr. Balzano ; told it almost whispering almost incanting almost shouting , impelled by the chaotic rhythms of his own voice . He could n't stop , no , and he could n't tear his eyes from Mr. Balzano , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , even his eyes motionless on his face . And he went on telling , telling , till he reached yesterday afternoon as dark came , he passed the Common , he reached the corner of State Street and halted . Just beyond was Shaw 's Lane , alongside the U.S. Rubber Co. , by the great brick smokestack penetrating the sky , Big Dick the kids used to call it . Yes , halted . Because something was missing . The corner was different <p> That corner . Yesterday it would not come <p> Maybe I would n't let it , Mr. Balzano . <p> But it came now  --  he saw the building , its great front windows , the doorway , the two cement steps ; and he smelled the meats and cigarettes and stale cartons as strong as real ; and he waited , turbulent <p> He slipped to the floor , he bowed his head and gazed into the floor as if it were visible there : the corner was a market , it was winter , there was snow on the ground , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tavern , there were two boys farther on , Hal and Carmine , throwing snowballs , they ran , he was sitting on the curb beside his sled , a man who had been standing in front of Mello 's Market talking with two others crossed the street , he halted not far off and stared down at him a long time , then the man hawked , he spat , the glob of spittle struck his cheek , hot , he was stunned , he dared not move , without a word the man turned and went back , his cheek burned , he did n't touch it , he grabbed his sled , he would not run , he walked slowly up the street , he did not wipe the spit off his face till he ducked into Shaw 's Lane , he had nothing to use , he wiped it with his sleeve , wiped and wiped . His cheek smarted . His mother would see his face , and his stepfather . What would he say ? What was it ? He felt attacked , shamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balzano . <p> Did Mr. Balzano feel the burning on his cheek ? <p> I did n't know it then , Mr. Balzano , but blood knew  --  blood knows shame before knowledge of shame : once they shame you , you find reasons . All our lives there 's shame . Does a thing born in us goad-to make something in us stand up against our own shame and make and make to retaliate for small , puny , queer , for Cooney 's foot , for a Jap face , for Jew , Wop- ? <p> You know Wop , Mr. Balzano , and poor and broken English and immigrant <p> It 's madness , demenza , Mr. Balzano , irrazionale . <p> They 're afraid because our madness is in them , they do n't know what to do with it so they condemn  --  but when they see what we make of it , they recognize it , they claim it . Nobody can do without madness . I put mine into my paintings . The paintings are theirs now . <p> Mr. Balzano ... <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not feel relieved , not cleansed , and where was the joy ? <p> He dropped his head , exhausted . His knees ached . He was an old man talking to an old man , waiting . What did he expect ? Words ? Mr. Balzano 's hand on his head ? <p> He looked up into those eyes so like his own . They were nervous , riled  --  like hers . Sometimes hers were two gray moths striking at glass . He felt them battering to escape his own body . <p> Nothing came . <p> He rose . It seemed almost sacrilegious not to take Mr. Balzano 's hand and say , Goocl-bye , I 'm going  --  forever . But in this place every farewell must be a crucifixion . He would go as if it were the usual visit , and disappear . Was n't that the most merciful ? <p> But  --  to whom ? <p> At the door he lingered too long . Mr. Balzano was sitting still , lost in the sketches lined along the bureau . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balzano with him through dusk , dark , through the weight of last things . He did them  --  called the utilities , telephone company , arranged for the hired dumpster to be picked up , told Denhie Lips-comb the junkman he could get the key from his real estate broker to pick up the bed and mattress and clear the remains out of the house . <p> He lay down , barren he felt , too worn to sleep this last night here . Yet in the silt of him , deep , something stirred , moved ; in the darkness forms rose , materialized  --  bodies , faces ... his mother father grandfather Eddie Earl Jay-Jay schoolmates and teachers McGovern Bullock Rin-aldi Sisson and Lucia Marion Mrs. Stevens Beatrice Harold , so many . He did not expect the crowding : you had no control of them , they insinu. ated , willed themselves present , wandered in your head , insisted on being seen ... He was at the mercy of those who had waited all the years in this house , displaced now by emptiness . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , close , till he heard them moving deep in dark , yes , heard sounds at the doors , at windows , living winds in the house , in the cellar , and creaks came , chafings , vague scuffings , then a long silence , which assured  --  It 's my imagination , I 'm tired , I 'll be glad to leave  --  and just under his room something scraped the cellar floor . <p> He got up and went along the hall to the inside basement door , switched the light on , and went down the long stairs  --  and stood . Nothing this side , in the old rec room . There was nothing in the furnace room or the coal bin . He stood looking into the laundry and storage area behind the furnace , which his grandfather had partitioned off with crisscrossed slats . Something ... some night creature  --  he sensed itwas alive there .... <p> He was gazing between slats straight into eyes . Somebody was standing by his grandfather 's cot . <p> He went behind the partition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadow , You ! <p> He was breathing with a harsh tear , he raised his arms , his fingers flexed as if trying to speak . The man was exhausted . <p> What was he doing here ? <p> But the man was too exhausted to question . From his wing Mr. Balzano could easily walk out at any time . How would they know ? <p> He said , You 're worn out . Sit  --  <p> Mr. Balzano 's arms battered air . Nooo . Here . Please <p> Mr. Balzano sank onto the cot , heaving , his hands struggling in silent speech . <p> And instantly he felt he had n't left Mr. Balmno , he was still in the nursing home , it seemed so natural , this moment he wanted Mr. Balzano here . <p> He kneeled by the cot . <p> He said , My grandfather used to rest here , it was his nook when he tended the furnace , I 'd hear him talking to himself . <p> So close to him , in shadow , Mr. Balzano was sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eyes catching the light , the sharp nose and high cheekbones and the beard , his face confounded-looked so young . Mr. Balzano 's face looked like  --  he felt a surge of shame , and anger  --  yes , it resembled that other face . He closed his eyes : the man had crossed the street and stared at him and spat . He felt the stare , the quick burn of spit . His hand touched his cheek . <p> Him . <p> Could he be ? <p> Was that face what had drawn him against his will to the dark figure in the sea of light at the nursing home ? <p> Was that you ? <p> His voice dropped so low that Mr. Balzano raised his head . His thick brows arched , his eyes widened , his lips parted , exposing the tongue . <p> Was it ? <p> Mr. Balzano 's hand rose , felt over his fingers , gripped his wrist hard , and drew him so close that he felt Mr. Balzano 's breath on his cheek , he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mio figlio ? Mr. Balzano said . <p> My son . The words pulsed . <p> Mr. Balzano gripped his wrist harder . Mio figlio , he repeated . <p> Io ? His own voice startled . Me . <p> And at the word Mr. Balzano uttered a sharp cry , seized his other hand , clutched both to his forehead and held them tight there , with a sound half-wailing half-laughing , till releasing them abruptly , he sank back onto the cot and lay there , heaving and smiling , smiling . <p> Where did Mr. Balzano think he was ? <p> And he  --  He could not contain . All he could say was Rest , sleep , and tomorrow ... <p> Mio figlio . <p> He watched a while , waited till Mr. Balzano 's breathing fell to normal . <p> Cautiously he rose and left him , went his way up the stairs , impelled , yes , by a curious elation . All night he lay restless , expecting them to enshroud him and to possess the emptiness . But none returned . Mr. Balzano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Did Mr. Balzano 's presence in the house ward them off ? <p> Or had he imagined  --  ? <p> At first light he could no longer lie there . <p> Not to wake Mr. Balzano , he eased down the steps , guided only by the early light through the basement windows , and crossed the cellar . <p> The furnace hulked dark , the great isinglass eye blank-dead , too , the dark behind it , the very air dead . <p> He held his breath , to listen ... No stirs . <p> But before he rounded the furnace , he knew  --  he saw the clear gray stretch of cot-it was empty . Gone , he cried . The word tolled . <p> Had he only imagined  --  ? <p> Forlorn , mystified , he was about to go back up when his foot chariced against a small white thing on the floor . <p> He held it up to the morning light . <p> That envelope ! It was his own sketch of Mr. Balzano 's house . Mr. Balzano had been here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberated throughout the hollow cellar . <p> He went upstairs . Morning filled the empty rooms , it floated and it hung still , it bared the skeleton of the house , it stood his shadow dark . He saw how flimsy are the bones of a man , or a house . Out the windows , town stood , and harbor , so strange and unfamiliar in the first fire of morning flowing down Hope Street that for a moment he wondered where he was before his vision settled , clear and clean . <p> <p> By H. E. FRANCIS <p>
