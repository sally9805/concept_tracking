Besides Hillerich &amp; Bradsby , the manufacturer of the Louisville Slugger , 10 companies are authorized to make bats for major league players , and KC Slammer is far and away the smallest and unlikeliest of the bunch . Whereas hundreds of workers in eight plants turn out a total of one million wooden Louisville Sluggers and about 1.3 million aluminum bats each year , a former truck driver named Jon Moyer  --  the 42-year-old founder , president and chief bat maker of KC Slammer  --  expects to produce around 2,000 of his heavily lacquered , white-ash wands this year with only the assistance of his wife , Kay , and two women in their Kansas City , Kans. , neighborhood . // Walk into the Moyers ' living room and you 're apt to see a few dozen Slammers ordered by Kansas City Royal first baseman Wally Joyner and third baseman Gary Gaetti , St. Louis Cardinal infielder Chris Sabo , New York Yankee centerfielder Bernie Williams or New York Met catcher Todd Hundley . In the laundry room there may be six other bats destined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be shipped as soon as Terry Haase has put on the lettering and the lacquer finish . // It was through David Segui , the former Met who now plays first base for the Montreal Expos but lives in Kansas City , Kans. , that a half dozen Mets began using the Slammer . " I tried a few of Jon Moyer 's bats in the winter of ' 93 and have been sold on them since , " says Segui . " They last far longer than any other bat I 've tried , and I get more carry from them . " // So much carry , in fact , that Segui belted a career-high 10 home runs as a Met last season and through Aug. 10 this year was hitting 71 points above his career average of .257 . " Jon 's a perfectionist , " says Segui . " He does n't cut any corners . " // A transplanted Canadian and former hockey player , Moyer never gave bat making a thought until another trucker , Charlie Ketron , approached him in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the team Ketron was managing in the Kansas City Men 's Senior Baseball League ( MSBL ) , in which wooden bats are required . " Ours were cracking left and right , and it was costing a lot of money , " Ketron says . " I knew Jon did some woodworking , so I asked him if he could make us some bats that would last . " // Eager to help out a fellow trucker , Moyer bought some northern white-ash logs in Pennsylvania and settled in at the workbench in his basement . Within a few weeks he had produced his prototype . // Word of the KC Slammer 's durability and of Moyer 's service soon spread through the Kansas City MSBL . " In more than 30 years I 've never seen a bat last as long , " says Gary Bond , who plays first base for the MSBL Royals . " I 've used the Slammer in about 175 games over three years and have broken only three bats . First time up I hit one out . Second time up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larson , said , ' Let me try one . ' He did and hit a grand slam . Now almost everyone on our team , and a lot of other guys in the league , use the Slammer. " // By August 1993 Moyer had quit trucking and was turning out about 500 bats a year , mainly for MSBL players and some minor leaguers , who make up the bulk of his off-season business . After seeing Segui swing the striking-looking Slammer so successfully last year , fellow Mets Bobby Bonilla ( since traded to the Baltimore Orioles ) , Jeff Kent and Ryan Thompson began to use it . " The first time Ryan tried it , he hit a homer in St. Louis , " Segui recalls , adding that Ryan has been a Slammer user ever since . // When Moyer 's business doubled last year , he took on two neighbors as part-time workers : Haase , and Toni Johnson , who did lettering and most of the sanding until she was replaced this summer by another neighbor , Carol Pierce . Moyer thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisville Sluggers are produced in 15 seconds on automatic lathes , Moyer takes about 13 minutes to carve a bat out of a 27-inch square billet on one of his manual lathes . The key to the KC Slammer 's durability , he says , may be the tempering process he uses and the many coats of lacquer he applies . // Last month Moyer moved into a 5,000-square-foot plant six miles from his home . What with the expansion , might he add hockey sticks to his inventory ? " It 's in the back of my mind , " he says , " but for now I 'm too busy making the KC Slammer . " And much too busy to drive an 18-wheeler.
