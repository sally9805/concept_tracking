here is time , while you 're suspended 100 feet above Squaw Valley 's KT-22 , to pick out an imaginary route down from the cornice above , among the bumps , where everybody goes , or the less-traveled fall lines , where tracks slice the baked snow like pieces of pie . It was March , my first trip to Tahoe , my first ride up that famous chair . The sun drooped long blue shadows across the noaherly'faces and lit up the vapor trails of skiers dropping from the rim . A mouthwatering sight for the true expert , for whom this terrain would be child 's play . Harrowing for the poor fool wondering how the hell to get down . I could n't help thinking about that nice man who had sold me life insurance last fall . Would it be fair to him for me to ski thisl I thought of my wife and child . I 'm one of those people who prefer slow chairlifts because they giwe time for contemplation , for the preparation of wills . If there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KT-22 , I 've not seen it . Pure vertical . Unrelenting , almost bdttomless . An open playground for gravity . I could feel the tug of it from the chair . It felt like my socks were being pulled aown inside my ski boots . The chair ! ift debouches atop a narrowish summit of windtortured conifers and snow-caked rock . To the left is the expeas ' terrain . To the right ( the route recommended by the American College of Orthopedic Surgeons ) is a road about a snowcat and a half wide that leads down to the saddle between KT-22 and the higher ridgeline to the summit of Squaw Peak . I turned right , and right again , and without pausing , tipped my skis aown toward the conga line of antsized skiers streaming along the Mountain Run a thousand or so feet below . I had n't even slowed enough to catch the name of the run . Squaw does n't bother much with the formality of named runs . This one had been ironed as smooth as a dress shirt the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been in the freezer for a couple of months : almost icy in spots , but grippy enough to hold an edge . Sheets of loose snow shivered down the slope after each looping turn . There was enough width to the run that I could swing the turns wide and fast , no other skiers , no bumps to crowd me , just a suggestion of the mountain 's own bone and muscle beneath the snow . This was the-sort of run I came to the West for . My brief for the week was to explore this famous ecperts ' stomping ground on behalf of family men and women , lapsed experts like myself , people with plans to outlive the actuarial tables . On my first morning , I 'd already found a back door off of KT-22 . A great run that was fast and steep , but not cruel , not overpowering enough to force me to make the 22 kick turns that gave the peak its name . I had been carrying around a mental picture of Squaw Valley for years , imprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map I 'd picked up at a ski show in 196S . On the map the sun is always at 10:30 A.M .. A foot and a half of new snow whitens the tiny trees . KT-22 stands to the left , 2,000 feet high . Cliffs loom over the sunny toy village at the bottom , but above the rock outcroppings , a broad lap of meadows basks in permanent sunshine underneath the summit of Squaw Peak . There are lifts everywhere and it all looks like it could be handled by a 10-year-old . A false impression , but false impressions are the currency of trail-map paintings . In an odd sort of way , a trail map is an invitation : " Come ski here . Explore . Surprise yourself . Get lost  --  we 'll help you find your way home . " But it does n't always turn out that way . n 1960 , the year the Olympics were held there , Squaw Valley was the first ski resort most of America had ever seen-outside the pages of Life magazine , anyway . We saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flared rooflines , the lodges photogenically banked in the snow . It was all a bit like Disneyland  --  Walt Disney himself organized the opening ceremonies . TV discovered the Olympics that year . America discovered stretch pants and A-frame architecture . The office workers in the crowd outside the Today Show window in New York conversed intelligently about the advantages of the egg position in the downhill . And suddenly , skiing was America 's favorite sport . It was cool . It was modern . Most impoantly , to a world dominated by two superpowers with bald leaders , it was youthful . For 10 days in February , the TV screens were filled with young racers wearing skin-tight pants , instead of by old men in overcoats and fedoras . Soon enough we 'd have a president who had hair and did n't even wear a hat . Squaw Valley opened a new age in America . And with a few exceptions , the resort remains almost a museum to that time . As the chairlift climbs up KT-22 , you can drape an arm over the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still an angular clutter of lihh ? reight ' ' 60s architecture . No boomton of condos and shops . On the other side of the valley , funky , unambitious little chalets , built out of cedar and ' redwood , climb the hillside . Locals seem proud that there 's so little development here . The faithful will say it 's because everything that matters is up on the mountain itself : bottomless steeps , vast acreage , 33 lifts and no waiting , America 's answer to the wide-open ski circuses of Europe . After all these years the mountain is still uncrowded , except on weekends when people pile in from the San Francisco Bay area in droves . Squaw is unflashy , underbuilt , and seems entirely indifferent to success . The opposite of what you would expect one of America 's premier resorts to be . The Resoa at Squaw Creek , where I stayed with my wife and two-year-old son , is everything the rest of Squaw Valley is not . Posh , service-oriented , luxuriously appointed , hugely built . The stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of long woods and a stiff five iron away from the main village across the golf course . Being a bit removed , I thought it might be inconvenient , but it was n't . Every morning I fetched breakfast and a paper from the deli downstairs . We took our time over breakfast , enjoying our window-filling view of the mountain , debating the major issues of the day : Sweaters or jackets ? Sunglasses or goggles ? One of us would drive Evan over to Ten Little Indians , the licensed daycare center in the village . ( He loved it . He cried every afternoon when we picked him up . ) Our skis were kept in the locker room downstairs , where we 'd also stow our goggles and extra jackets , in case the weather changed . Every morning by the elevator we could pick up a list of the runs groomed the night before . By 9:30 A.M. ( a civilized hour ) , we coud be on the Squaw Creek chair , which started just below our window and traveled to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow King slopes every morning , while the sun was on the upper faces and the corduroy-textured piste had n't been skied off yet . Snow King has 1,350 feet of veaical , with the main run rounding a shoulder of the mountain , cascading among trees and gladed meadows . Under the Squaw Creek chair there are also some steep drops through the trees . Gold Coast , the mid-mountain area between Squaw and Emigrant peaks , is the main intermediate playground . But its five chairs rise a max of 6nly 760 feet . It 's where everybody goes because everybody has always gone there . But the best intermediate skiing on the mountain can be found on Snow King . Over on the Squaw Creek side we knew our way around . We never really penetrated the mysteries of the larger mountain , even though we did try . Every day , we set off armed with our trail map and the printed list of the day 's groomed runs in search of intermediate terrain  --  long steep runs groomed for cruising , unmogulled routes down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The grooming sheet named runs which were n't marked on the trail map . The only trail named on the map is The Mountain Run , an expressway that drops 2,000 feet from Gold Coast to the village . And most of the biggest verticals were on the chairs  --  KT-22 , Cornice II , Headwall , Silverado , Broken Arrow  --  marked " experts on ! y . " We did n't relish the idea of going up an expert chair looking for a particular groomed route down , if the groomed route was n't to be found . I began feeling nostalgic for all those totem poles of green and blue and black trail signs that clutter the landscapes of other ski resoas , but at least keep the skier oriented . I asked a ski patroller where I could find some of the runs on the groomed list . He was n't sure . He told me that the grooming crew and the ski patrol did n't have the same names for many of the runs . Instead he directed us to the intermediate and novice area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowds were out in their neon outfits . The sun on good days at Squaw is ruthless , tanning everybody the color of old leather luggage . Runs wandered comfortably , easily , with na sense of hurry , among the enormous conifers and gentle bowls . Along one of the unnamed blue trails , a photographer and-a crowd of hiply dressed assistants were shooting a fashion spread for the designer Versace . We slipped over the upper right corner of the trail map and spent a good hour skiing some good , rolling , treelined trails off of the Shirley Lake and Solitude chairs . Later we had hamburgers on the sundeck at the Gold Coast chalet , where we could look up at the big verticals that were all given over to bumps. n our third day a storm moved in . Faith , who 's always smarter about these things , decided she 'd rather spend the day in the spa and exercise room at Squaw Creek than fight the elements . Maybe if the weather cleared , she 'd take Evan skating in the after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more adventurously . An hour later I was lost in a whiteout at the top of Emigrant . Twenty minutes later , when the air cleared a bit , I gratefully took my frozen fingers and ears down to Gold Coast for a cup of tea . A ski patroiler , who was thawing his beard and eyebrows over a cup of coffee , told me the best place to be on a day like this was over on the Shirley Lake side of the ridge . He was right . There the wind was close to nil , and skiing next to the trees I could at least be certain my skis were pointed downhill . I only got seriously lost twice more , once straying don among the trackless moguls of Silverado , where I did n't meet another soul , and later in a clQud among the meadows of Bailey 's Beach , where the disembodied voices of lift riders sounded like angel voices coming out of the air . Here , at the far end of Bailey 's Beach , I stumbled across the muchtouted High Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the tram . It 's a huge place , but in the middle of the storm , it looked like Ice Station Zebra , its bungee tower disappearing into the clouds . Most of my memories of the week are of sunshine and big views of gorgeous mountains and Lake Tahoe , lunch on a warm bench outside Dave 's Deli in the village . But all week long I heard vague rumors of wonderful runs that I was never able to find . Squaw regulars probably know the names of all the trails , or all the trails they like to ski , but they keep this knowledge to themselves . Perhaps there is a secret handshake . Several times , in the hot tub at the end of the da we met a couple about our age from Gig Harbor , Washington . We 'd talk about where we 'd had dinner the night before and what we 'd had to eat . And we 'd discuss the day 's skiing . " Oh , I had a great run , " he 'd say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little ways , then turn downhill where there 's a crooked tree and then sort of fade left again and you end up on this really nice trail , but I do n't know the name of it ... sorry . " lknew what he meant . I tod him about my fabulous run down the back side of KT-22 . " I think the run was called Saddle . Somebody else said it was called Chicken Bowl . " I offered to draw him a picture . It was like trying to give someone direaions to a restaurant in Paris , where the streets change names every two blocks . Squaw Valley is a wonderful and contrary sort of place . It 's clubbish where most resorts are mass market . There 's little of that alarming chumminess as you 're being loaded onto the chair : " Hi , I 'm Kevin and I ' ' 11 be your lift operator today . " Instead , Squaw is content to let the mountain charm you , and there is a kind of integrity in that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get lost on . Getting lost , after all , is what most of us are trying to do when we 're on vacation . Is n't it ! othing is random . You live , die , pay taxes , move to Squaw . It 's the place you see in all the ski flicks , with the groovy attitudes , toasty-warm days , wild lines , and that enormous lake . It 's California ! Squallywood ! It 's the one place where every born-to-ski skier , at some point or other , wants to move to ; where people will crawl a thousand miles over broken glass for the chance to ski freezer burn . The one place to make it as a " professional " skier . My friend Kent Kreitler , a phenomenal skier who does n't live anywhere in particular , finally announced , " I think I 'm moving to Squaw . " " So Kent , " I said , " let me tell you what the rest of your life will be like . " And I laid it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person you 'll meet is Scott Kirby . He 's a guy with frizzy red hair and multiple base-of-the-mountain jobs , everything from teaching kids to dishing ice cream . He moves fast , talks to everybody . You ca n't go anywhere without seeing him . People call him " the mayor . " Your talk with Scott will be brief ; he has impoaant running around to do . That 's okay , because you need to find a job . The point of this job : to score a season pass . If money and prestige mean little to you , then a job will be easy to find : washing dishes , parking cars , loading lifts . But you do it , because working for the ski resort includes a ski pass . But if you want money and a status job ( i.e. , one that pays decent enough money that you can buy your own pass ) , like tending bar , waiting tables , or tuning skis ; first someone has to either die or move out of town ( which never happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on somebody 's floor or rent out somebody 's closet . Once you save enough money to buy a P.O. box and a phone ' hookup , you can boast true local status . Things are looking good . Smooth vibes . An endless social hour . The place seems overrun by skiers from the East Coast . Everyone seems hip , healthy , strong , and ready to kick your butt . You meet Velvet Jones ( he 's soooo smooth ) , the Debris Brothers ( a famous ski-film sibling combo ) , The Greek , Toddzilla , Bull Dog , Hollywood , Holmes , Clavin , Nintendo , Parking Lot ( he worked in the parking lot for five years ) , and Single Cell ( so named for the number of brain cells he sup posedly has left ) . One day it ocsurs to you that these " ski bums " are all wearing thousand-dollar ski outfits and trashing three new pairs of skis a season . Scott Hurd , more duct tape than man , explains : " Everyone seems to be a movie star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone is sponsored by equipment companies . You ca n't swing a chicken without hitting someone in the ski industry ( or the mayor , ' cause he 's everywhere ) . You 're curious to find out if you 're as good a skier as you think . So you find a group of locals and try to keep up . On powder days the excitement builds like a pressure cooker . Move fast , because it only takes an hour for the entire mountain to get tracked up . There 's oodles of cliff jumps and psycho lines . You 'd better just do it , because within seconds , 10 other yahoos will have already jumped and tracked out the landing pad . Tf you 're a truly amazing skier ( anything else inspires only polite smiles and undisguised yawns ) , then you land clean on jumps and shred through anything with style . If not , the hyperactivity of the place will motivate you to ski the same lines anyway . Either way is fulfilling . Occasionally a random miracle occurs , and the patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days you do n't bother with a warm-up run  --  jus hike 15 minutes from the top of the Siberia Express chair and coolly launch some hospital air off Main Chute . There are other places to express your extreme nature . When everything else gets tracked , you hike up Granite Peak for its steep chutes . If the snowpack is good , you climb 10 minutes from the top of the KT-22 chair to Eagle 's Nest . And jumping the Fingers off KT-22 seems particularly heroic : Not only do you need speed to clear the sloping rocks , but it 's right ( ahem ) under the lift . Eventually you meet the KT-22 hard cores . There 's KT Larry , who 's had a season pass since 1968 and skis only the KT-22 lift all day , every day . ( During the ' ' 92- ' ' 93 season , he skied 154 consecutive days solely on the one lift . ) There 's Blue , Tuck , and a guy named Mike who keeps a log book detailing every run he 's ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else . But you do , because skis are expensive and you keep busting them . So you work the scene . In part for fame , gldry , and free gear , but mostly because that 's what Squaw locals do . You compete in a few races or mogul competitions , and maybe you finally convince one of the local photographers ( Hank , Chaco , Larry , et al ) to shoot you , and you dazzle them with your big cajones and style . You and John Tremann  --  ski model of the century  --  become buddies . And then one day , you meet Joe Mama . Joey Dukeman from Boston , with the wicked Beantown accent ( Yo ! ) , skis with a Super-8 movie camera and shoots his favorite pals . At the end of the season he uses the footage to make a hard-core ski movie . Last year he called it The Dogs of Wintev ( Winta ) . This year it 's called , yep , Dogs of Wirtter 2 . " You 're just not anybody unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Debris Bros . Why is that ? " I ca n't explain it . It 's a phenomenon . " Over the next few years your fame grows . You 're cool enough that Humptys in Tahoe City lets you in for free . You score ee sponsorsiip gear . You have an employee ski pass , but you have n't been an employee for months . The next few steps to ski-hero status are tough ones . First , being sponsored by Heckler Brau is mandatory . A Germantrained brewmeister , Heckler staaed his own beer company , and now sponsors ateam of skiers and snowboarders . Today he 's cooler than liquid Velveeta . Everybody drinks it ( the beer , not the Velveeta ) , but only the chosen ones become sponsored by the man and get to wear that huge Heckler Brau patch . ( Snowboarder Shaun Palmer , a notorious drinker , will earn 100 free cases of Heckler Brau if he can survive this year without drinking . Seems like a whacked reward for being soher . ) Win enough races or contests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day you 're important enough that Squaw gives you a season pass . You ski with visiting VIPs and participate in celebrity ski invitationals . Then it happens . Susan from the WIjldflour Baking Co. in the Olympic House Mall stops you at the tram base and asksI you to work next Swnday as a celebrity guesti Time to stop talking skiing and start talldng cookies . A huge crowd shows up to get your autograph and touch the hem of your Noah Face shell pants . Time passes . Your toenails are permanently gone . That big skier 's butt of yours is more and more difficult to maintain . You invest in a local business , finally make some money , and stop living in closets . You start vacationing at the Resort at Squaw Creek . What 's next ! It 's up to you . Fill in the blanks . Create your own happy ending . But never doubt each fall , as you cradle your new season pass to your chest , still warm from lamination , that Squaw 's anything but bliss . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
