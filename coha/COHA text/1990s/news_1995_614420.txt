Admission is free . Competition begins at 9 a.m . Thursday and Friday and continues until 10 p.m . Play will be held from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m . Saturday and the finals will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m . Sunday . Competing will be Kevin Han , Ben Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erika Von Heiland and Kathy Zimmerman . <p> BASEBALL <p> Ten of 40 invitations have been issued for USA Baseball 's June tryouts in Millington , Tenn . All are sophomores except Clemson catcher Matt LeCroy , a freshman . Stanford pitcher Jason Middlebrook , Tennessee pitcher R.A. Dickey and Florida pitcher Jon Kaufman were members of the 1994 USA Baseball Team . Players not invited may walk on if willing to pay their own expenses . Should a walk-on make the club , he would be reimbursed . <p> BASKETBALL <p> Predrag Danilovic , considered the best player in Europe and projected to join the Miami Heat next season , could be a major beneficiary of the international federation 's decision to allow Serbia to compete this summer in the European Championships in Athens , Greece . The shooting guard is expected to join the Los Angeles Lakers ' Vlade Divac on Serbia 's entry in the pre-Olympic qualifying tournament . Like Divac , Danilovic could n't play in the 1992 Games because of his former nation 's political split . " It feels good to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing for Bologna in the Italian League , " and I 've wanted to play in the NBA since I was a kid . Now I have that chance . " The 6-foot-6 Danilovic , originally drafted in the second-round by Golden State ( 43rd pick ) , had his rights traded to Miami in the preseason Billy Owens-Rony Seikaly trade . He is regarded as an excellent shooter with a deceptively quick first step . <p> BEACH VOLLEYBALL <p> Sandblaster Karch Kiraly will go for his 100th win on the beach this weekend in Singer Island , Fla . Kiraly , with 99 wins , and partner Kent Steffes , with 73 , are the likely top U.S. Olympic team . The only other players to hit the 100 mark are Sinjin Smith with 135 wins and Randy Stoklos with 122 . Kiraly , 34 , led the United States to gold medals in indoor volleyball in 1984 and 1988 . He is the top earner in beach volleyball , with $ 1.7 million in winnings . <p> BOXING <p> So much for projecting success . Light heavyweight Benjamin McDowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goodwill Games , has struggled since that tournament and has upset officials at USA Boxing in the process . McDowell , an Army boxer stationed at Fort Bragg , N.C. , lost in the Pan American trials to Antonio Tarver , who earned a trip to Argentina . He has declined invitations to go to certain dual meets or tournaments , telling coaches , " I ca n't peak more than twice a year . " He agreed to fight in a tournament in Cuba last month only after Army coach Jesse Ravelo threatened to kick him off the boxing team and send him back to his unit in the field . McDowell went to Cuba but lost 12-0 to Diosvany Vega , the fighter he had beaten for the gold in Russia . <p> CANOE/KAYAK <p> Though it 's mainly a race for unranked white-water paddlers , the Olympic South Regional Trials on the Nantahala River will attract some top-caliber athletes . Races will start at 8:30 a.m . Saturday and Sunday at the Nantahala Outdoor Center near Bryson City , N.C. Regional trials offer a way for unranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a venue for the development of younger athletes . Winners also qualify for the U.S. Olympic Festival in July . U.S. team members Jason Beakes and Kevin Michaelson have entered this weekend 's races . Other athletes to watch are Junior World Championship two-man canoe medalists John Grumbine and Chris Ennis , and kayak junior team medalists Kyle Elliot , Scott Parsons and Josh Russell . <p> CYCLING <p> When Greg LeMond , three-time winner of the Tour de France , pedaled a bicycle in Atlanta last Friday with a contingent of disabled cyclists embarking on a world tour , it was the first time he 'd ridden since dropping out of the 1994 Tour . LeMond retired from cycling last winter after being diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy , a rare condition that robs the muscles of the ability to efficiently use oxygen . Before being diagnosed with the muscular disease , LeMond considered taking up mountain biking to qualify for the 1996 team . . . . Surveying the Midtown terrain of the 1996 road cycling course , LeMond predicted the course would n't be challenging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbs . <p> DIVING <p> Before the Pan Am Games , U.S. diver Patrick Jeffrey said the 10- meter event there would be his last one from the high platform . But after winning a bronze medal and talking it over with his coach , Ron O'Brien , Jeffrey will continue to work on both the platform and the 3-meter springboard . Jeffrey made the 1988 Olympic team as a 10-meter diver , but has suffered numerous injuries from the 35 mph impact of platform dives . " If he keeps getting injured , we may have to face that decision in the future , " said O'Brien . " We almost had to face it in December . " <p> EQUESTRIAN <p> The U.S. Equestrian Team won its first gold medal this week at the Pan Am Games . Rider Michael Matz of Collegeville , Pa. , and The General , a 14-year-old Thoroughbred , beat 25 other riding duos for the individual gold in show jumping , Matz 's third Pan Am gold . In 1979 , he won individual and team gold on Jet Run . A silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif. , and her 8-year-old Trakehner gelding , Hannabal . The United States won a team silver in dressage and a team bronze in show jumping . . . . Riders Dorothy Trapp of Lexington , Ky. , and Robert Dover of Lebanon , N.J. were named the U.S. Olympic Committee 's 1994 Athletes of the Year . Trapp and Dover were the two highest-placing Americans at the World Equestrian Games last summer in The Netherlands . <p> FENCING <p> Fencers can choose one of three weapons . Men compete in sabre , epee and foil . Historically women have competed only in foil . But the 1996 Olympics heralds a new age for women , with the introduction of epee fencing . Sabre fencing originated from cavalry combat , where men fought on horseback with a two-edged sword . The foil is a lightweight rectangular sword that evolved as a practice weapon for the epee . Duels were originally conducted with a sword similar to the triangular-shaped epee . <p> FIELD HOCKEY <p> Talking about down to the wire . The U.S. women 's squad did n't score against its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their match in the Pan Am Games . Argentina landed a goal just four minutes earlier in a 1-1 tie . One for the record books : The men 's and women 's squad each racked up 11 points in their defeat of scoreless Paraguay teams . The women face the host country Saturday for golf in a rematch of the 1987 Pan Am finals , which Argentina won . <p> GYMNASTICS <p> Scott Keswick 's future is in doubt , which bodes ill for the U.S. national team . A 1992 Olympian and defending U.S. all-around champion , Keswick sustained a herniated disk while training and has been told to refrain from physical activity until next month , when doctors will determine whether he will need surgery . Keswick was injured during an off- balance dismount from the rings while training for the American Cup . Best scenario : He can return for the U.S. Nationals in August . Worst scenario : His career is over . He and Dominique Dawes were awarded the McDonald 's " Balancing It All " award in Seattle , citing achievements on and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training funds . <p> JUDO <p> U.S. Judo officials are working to arrange a major international competition in Georgia this summer . Still in the planning and negotiation phases , officials are looking at sites in metro Atlanta and in Macon for the U.S. International Invitational in August . While the competition is not slated as an official Olympics test event , it is expected that judo competitors from upto 35 nations would attend , using the contest to familiarize themselves with the area in preparation for ' 96 . <p> MODERN PENTATHLON <p> It was deja vu all over again for Michael Gostigan . His horse threw him in last year 's World Championships , upsetting a winning bid . In last weekend 's San Antonio Cup , the Atlanta-based athlete was on a world- record pace when he was thrown again , and this time he separated some ribs . Gostigan needed only 955.95 points to win the tournament and was on the way to a perfect 1,100 . Dimitrii Tyurin of Kazakhstan was the winner with 5,557.25 . Gostigan , who scored 4,601.30 with a zero in riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in shooting and fifth in running . Terry Lewis and Mary Beth Larsen finished second and third in the women 's competition . Swede Kersti Danielsson was first . <p> RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS <p> Atlantan Becky Turner , one of seven women named to the rhythmic group National Team training squad , began training at Elite Sports Complex in Downers Grove , Ill. , this year . . . . Former Bulgarian National Team coach Efrossina Anguelova coaches the U.S. athletes . <p> ROWING <p> U.S. rowers at the Pan Ams did well over the weekend , earning 10 gold medals in 21 competitions . The men 's " eight " team , which won a gold medal in the World Rowing Championships in September , easily beat a strong Canada team by almost five seconds . The sport 's only Georgia connection , Cyrus Beasley , won a silver in the single sculls . Beasley attends Emory University . <p> SHOOTING <p> U.S. shooters took 31 medals at the Pan Am Games , including 12 gold medals . Also of significance , the team won a second 1996 Olympic slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Games , U.S. competitors automatically receive one slot for each event . Connie Petracek fought off a fever and strep throat to win the U.S. team a gold medal and a second slot in the Women 's Sport Pistol event . . . . The next major shooting event begins Sunday at Fort Benning , when the U.S. Shooting Team trials for the World Clay Target Championships will be held . <p> SOCCER <p> The winless U.S. performance at the Pan Am Games was disappointing , but not entirely unexpected . Olympic soccer rosters will be made up of players under 23 years old with each team getting three " wild card " players 23 or over . But the United States elected to take an entire roster of under-23 players for developmental purposes . <p> SOFTBALL <p> Columbus will host its first pre-Olympic softball event this summer , when four national teams gather for a competition nicknamed " SuperBall . " A U.S. team and three teams picked from among four other countries - Japan , Canada , China and Australia - will compete . " This will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic event , " said Rick Gordon , director of the city 's parks and recreation department . " Our community is excited about it . " . . . In 1996 , Columbus will host the NCAA annual women 's fast-pitch national championship tournament at Golden Park . The tournament , played on Memorial Day weekend , has been held in Oklahoma for five years , but is scheduled to be held in Columbus as a warm-up event for the Olympics . <p> SWIMMING <p> Four-time Olympic gold medalist Tamas Darnyi of Hungary , who seems to disappear between the Games , has resurfaced in Atlanta . There had been reports he 'd retired , but Darnyi is training with the Hungarian team at the Dynamo Swim Club pool in Chamblee . The individual medley champion arrived this month , later than the rest of the team , and will probably leave in early April . " I 'd been hearing unfounded rumors , " said Eric Namesnik , the U.S. Olympic silver medalist in the 400 IM in 1992 . " I do n't know why he 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself - young guys coming up . He should have stayed retired . " . . . Juan Antonio Samaranch , president of the International Olympic Committee , deflected a question about whether China being banned from the Pan Pacific meet in Atlanta set a dangerous precedent . " This swimming meet is a private organization , and they can extend invitations to any country they want , " he said at the Pan Am Games . " The People 's Republic of China is a full ( IOC ) member and will be invited to all our competitions . " <p> SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING <p> Several more coveted Olympic team trial slots could be decided when the U.S. Collegiate Synchronized Swimming Championships end Saturday at Stanford University . As members of the current U.S. National Team II ( National Team I is at the Pan Ams ) , Lisa Burton of Arizona State , Becky Jasontek and Emily Marsh of Ohio State , Jenny Mayer of San Jose State and Dawn Wales of St. Mary 's College have already qualified . But they 'll be pushed hard in Palo Alto by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the October trials by placing high enough in the solo or duet events . <p> TABLE TENNIS <p> The U.S. men 's and women 's teams won silver medals this past week in team competition at the Pan Am Games . The men 's team , Jim Butler and Derek May of Augusta and Sean O'Neill of McLean , Va. , finished second to Brazil . The women 's team , comprised of Lily Yip of Metuchen , N.J. , Wei Wang of Pasadena , Calif. , and Tawny Banh of Alhambra , Calif. , placed second to Canada . <p> TEAM HANDBALL <p> The National Championships will be held April 20-23 at the Georgia International Conventional and Trade Center . There will be 10 women 's teams and 20 men 's teams . Most squads are club teams with rosters stocked with college players . The national teams will scout the tourney keeping an eye open for potential players . <p> TENNIS <p> The problem with Olympic tennis , say some U.S. tennis officials , is that it is an individual event , not a team event . Ron Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the U.S. Olympic tennis representative , said discussions are ongoing to change the format . However , the current process will hold for Atlanta . " For the players , it 's just like another tournament . Because of the selection process , it is an individual event . It 's not like Davis Cup or Federation Cup . " The irony is that a U.S. player must be available for Davis Cup or Federation Cup play to be eligible for the Olympics . . . . If the selection were held today , America 's entries would be No. 1 Pete Sampras and No. 2 Andre Agassi for the men and No. 6 Lindsay Davenport and No. 12 Mary Joe Fernandez for the women . The U.S. would also have a men 's doubles team made up of Jared Palmer and Richey Reneberg . There are several possibilities for the women , including Martina Navratilova . <p> TRACK AND FIELD <p> Talk of relocating the New York Games , one of the major outdoor meets , to Atlanta has quieted for now , but it seems likely a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the 1996 Olympics . New York track officials are trying hard to keep the meet after having already lost the indoor championships to Atlanta two years ago . A major snag for Atlanta should be solved when renovations to the 20,000- seat DeKalb Memorial Stadium are complete this year . Local track officials are focusing on the 1997 outdoor season . Atlanta will host at least two major meets next year before the 1996 Games - the U.S. Olympic trials and an early test event in the Olympic stadium . Officials are looking to book something for the first or second weekend of May ' 96 , either a collegiate championship or an international meet . <p> VOLLEYBALL <p> First-time spectators of volleyball should be aware that the game has peculiar politenesses . After being introduced individually , teams shake hands and exchange little gifts , usually stickers or pins promoting the team or country . At the end of the match , players shake hands . When a coach is making a substitution , an incoming player displays a paddle bearing the number of the player being replaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands the paddle to the fellow team member and finally enters the court when the referee gives a nod of approval . And if a player displays what officials consider inappropriate behavior - bad language , vulgar gestures or just plain incredulity - the head official holds up a yellow card , telling the offending player that he or she is being watched closely . The second offense is rewarded with a red card , and the third offense gives the other team a point . <p> WATER POLO <p> Many teams film their practices . But the U.S. water polo team has taken the next step : It videotapes timeouts during scrimmages . Says head coach Rich Corso : " We 're looking to see who 's paying attention . Am I and the other coaches talking too long ? Are we giving the kids enough time to recover ? We 're using everything we can to make sure we have quality practices . " <p> WEIGHTLIFTING <p> American lifters set six national records and won four gold medals , including a pair by Wes Barnett in the clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan American Games . Considering that U.S. lifters did n't win a single gold medal at the 1991 Pan Am games in Havana , Cuba , U.S. Weightlifting Federation national coaching director Lynn Jones was pleased . " It was excellent , " Jones said . Besides Barnett , gold medals were won by by superheavyweight Mark Henry and 99 kg. lifter Pete Kelley , both in the snatch lift . Jones credited the U.S. resident training program , established at Colorado Springs , Colo. , four years ago to combine the top prospects with state-of-the-art training , medical and sports science technology . It produced half the 1992 Olympic team , all first-time Olympians , and has grown to include 16 lifters , including Kelley and Barnett , under the direction of coach Dragomir Cioroslan . <p> WRESTLING <p> Only a handful of collegiate wrestlers are considered to have a shot at making the U.S. Olympic team , and two suffered shocking losses last Saturday in the NCAA championships in Iowa City , Iowa . Penn State junior heavyweight Kerry McCoy , the No. 3-ranked 220-pound freestyler , lost 4-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa . That snapped McCoy 's winning streak at 88 matches , ending his hopes of next year breaking Iowa coach Dan Gable 's NCAA record of 98 straight wins . Also , Iowa junior 150-pounder Lincoln McIlravy ( 25-1 ) , a two-time champion , lost 13-10 in the finals to Steve Marianetti ( 28-3 ) of Illinois . Another potential Olympic candidate , North Carolina senior T.J. Jaworsky , won his third NCAA title , beating Oregon State 's Bobak Mohammadi 13-6 in the 134-pound final . <p> YACHTING <p> Hundreds of top U.S. sailors are in California this weekend for the second of this year 's six major American regattas that will be used to select the U.S. Olympic Sailing Team . The all-Olympic-class regatta , set for today through Sunday , is at Alamitos Bay Yacht Club in Long Beach , Calif . Some of the 10 U.S. sailors who competed in the Pam Am Games are expected to participate . The next major regatta is April 4-9 in Savannah . <p> PARALYMPICS <p> Joe Russel broke a national powerlifting record at the U.S. Team Trials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powerlifting Championships for the Disabled in Washington . Russel , who weighs 182 , benched 348 pounds , oblitering the mark of 319 in his weight class . Russel , a former world record holder , moved to Atlanta in 1991 and attends Georgia State . He is paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a 1976 auto accident .
