After seven long months , what we got was four minutes of petulance and prevarication . It felt less like a speech than a slap . <P> The President 's speech was a disaster , a historic failure that will be ever noted and long remembered . It was , in fact , a reverse Checkers speech . The Checkers speech was a defiant and manipulative statement that saved a career . The Monica speech was a defiant and manipulative statement that will , I believe , ultimately undo one . <P> The speech had to do four difficult things . First , it had to both be forthcoming and seem forthcoming . Second , it had to elicit from the audience sympathy , empathy , a desire on the part of Americans to make the collective leap from the pursuit of justice to the bestowing of mercy . Third , it had to answer more questions than it raised . And fourth , it had to make the case that it is in our interests as a great nation to move on ; it had to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It failed on all counts . The President was not and did not appear to be forthcoming . His previous untruthful statements were " legally accurate , " though he did not " volunteer information . " He had a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was " not appropriate . " His public comments and his silence gave " a false impression . " He regrets this . He used the lawyerly locutions of one who is using words not to reveal but to conceal . He could not resist the self-indulgent  --  he was the victim of questions raised " in a politically inspired lawsuit which has since been dismissed . " He meant to show conviction and instead revealed arrogance  --  " It 's nobody 's business but ours . " <P> The speech did not elicit sympathy because he was not tough on himself . He was , instead , tough on the independent prosecutor . His demeanor was not that of a strong man in a moment of contrition but that of a defensive man in a moment of aggression . There was no trust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust the compassion of the people he leads . When you fail to trust the people , they notice and are not warmed . More to the point , they are left uninclined to give you what you do n't give them . He did not explicitly apologize for having forced the country through seven solid months of mystery , distraction and embarrassment . He suggested this was the fault of an overzealous prosecution . <P> He raised more questions than he answered . What was the nature of the relationship that was " not appropriate " ? <P> Why was it " wrong " ? What did the patronizing " Even Presidents have private lives " mean ? Does it mean that Presidents can have sexual relations with 21-year-olds in the room next to the Oval Office and that if we look into it we are " prying into private lives " ? Has he learned anything ? Will this happen again ? Is it quite right for him to instruct the public to " turn away from the spectacle " and " repair the fabric of our national discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most recent deep tearing of the fabric ? <P> I should note here that just before the speech , a guest on Larry King Live said the President should " do a 100% grovel . " The American President can not , should not , must not grovel . But a strong man can tell hard truths ; can be tough on himself ; can , through painful candor , inspire a nation to be its best , most generous self . But he must be his best , most generous self first .
