BEFORE I COULD be enrolled in kindergarten , the Episcopal school affiliated with my parents ' church required my parents to teach me the Lord 's Prayer . So late one summer 's evening my mother called me inside , and I sat between her and my father on the sofa in the den . I had been playing with my best friend , Carla Benson , who was a year older , and we had been arguing about which hand went at the bottom of the bat , the right or the left . We had just discovered that she was left- and I was right-handed , and we were hitting each other over the head with our plastic bats . <p> " I killed you , " Carla said . <p> " Killed you first , " I said . <p> " No you did n't . " <p> When my mother picked me up by the arms , I complained because we were having a good time , and because the long California evening still had light left in it , the sky streaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the lightest shade of the purple night . Despite my protests , she brought me inside , much to Carla 's disgust . <p> In the den , my father was watching television with a highball glass in his hand and a prayer book in his lap . My mother switched off the set , and the black-and-white picture shrank to a pinprick of light which remained for a minute or more , unwilling to give up the ghost . <p> " There 's something important your mother wants to discuss , " my father said . Looking above the rim of his glass at my mother , he took one final swallow . " Me , too , I guess . " <p> " It 's time , kiddo , " my mother said , " that you learn how to pray . " <p> Actually , I already knew how to pray . Every evening at bedside , my parents knelt with me while I said the child 's evening prayer : " Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pray the Lord my soul to take . " <p> When the last two lines scared me too much , my mother recited for me an alternative ending that went : " Guide me through the starry night / and wake me when the sun shines bright . " So far I had n't died , but then we said the alternative ending quite a few times , making our plea for waking as well as soul preservation . I had worried about dying ever since I fell into a koi pond when I was three . By the time my father pulled me out , my eyes were bulging in their sockets like a carp 's , and I 've gone by the name Fish ever since , a reminder of my near-miss . In spite of my fears , my father , a lapsed Catholic , did n't believe prayers should be changed . He knelt with us but refused to recite the corrupted version . <p> " This is a special prayer , " my mother explained . " One that God Himself gave us to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that 's what the H. stands for . Jesus H. " <p> " Alan , " my mother said . <p> " It goes like this , " my father said . He recited Matthew 's version from memory , with his hands folded on the prayer book , his eyes closed , his forehead furrowed in concentration , like the good acolyte he had once been . My mother and I watched while he mumbled the last lines-the Protestant addition-unwillingly . <p> " Are n't you supposed to kneel ? " <p> " Yes , absolutely , " my father said . " Hell , we ought to be genuflecting . Have n't had a good genuflect in years . " He would have gotten out of his chair if it were n't for my mother 's fingers on his shoulder . <p> " You can say it kneeling , sitting , standing , or even when you 're in bed at night , " my mother said . " It 's all-purpose . The only thing you have to make sure of is that you mean what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father helped me through the prayer , line by line , until I could say it by heart . Then they asked if I understood . I said yes , but in my bed that night , as I said the prayer over again for myself , I wondered about the art God did in heaven and if hallowed was the same as hollow , his name echoing dully like a pipe , a box without a present inside . <p> In my bedroom there was a nightlight which my parents turned off when they went to bed , a lamp with an inner shade that turned , propelled by the heat of the bulb . On the outer shade was the picture of a passenger train rolling through forests and mountains . When the inner shade was turning , the train appeared to move . Now , while I had been saying the prayer to myself , the movement of the nightlight 's reflections seemed ominous and foreboding . Dark shapes loomed at the foot of my bed , then leaped to the ceiling and raced across the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical cords of floor lamps and the television set , my father had told me a story about the troll who lived in the outlets : he burned the skin off the bones of little boys , making their hair sizzle and pop . <p> " Our Father , " I began . " Our Father . " My mother had said that the Lord 's Prayer was a source of comfort and consolation , but try as I might I could not remember what came after . <p> THE MINISTER of St. James was a dedicated Anglophile named Chadwick . Father Chadwick was unmarried and did not much care for children , so he had appointed a retired minister , Father Millerton , to the post of school chaplain , a volunteer position with one singular benefit-the parsonage at the corner of the church parking lot , a ramshackle adobe house that Father Chadwick neither wanted nor cared for . Father Millerton had outlived his family-war had claimed his two sons , disease his wife and daughter-and he lived alone in the threeroom adobe . At noon , when kindergarten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led to his living room , where he served cookies and punch and taught us songs , and we prayed for our families , our pets and the missionaries in the Belgian Congo . He also told us stories from the Biblehow Jesus turned water into wine , the night Daniel spent with the lions , and the day the sun stood still ; he likewise told us about the missionaries in the remotest parts of the world-how they forded raging streams in Indonesia on the backs of crocodiles , how thousands of pygmies and cannibals who wore no clothes had responded to the word of God , but only after they had killed the messengers of the gospel . <p> Father Millerton had once served as a missionary in Dutch Guiana before ill health had forced him to resign , and his stories usually consisted of one faithful servant of God whose death hastened the conversions of thousands of natives . The songs he taught us were songs like " Onward , Christian Soldiers " and a children 's hymn about the saints of God whose various occupations included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang the line about the saint who was slain by a fierce wild beast , I felt a furrow of claws and teeth running the length of my spine . <p> I loved Father Millerton , but not everyone shared that opinion . During his stories there was as much whispering and covered laughter as there was attention . He was a big man who wore thick-soled shoes , and his black clerical shirt and trousers were always dusted with the snow of his dandruff and the scattering ashes of his cigars . Smoking was a habit he said he 'd picked up in the Guianas to ward off insects . His thick white hair fell in disordered hunks over his forehead . His flat red nose sat in the middle of a remarkably square face , and now , when I study photographs , I think he must have borne some resemblance to Charles Laughton as Quasimodo . There was no mistaking his resemblance to the drawing of the pigs in our classroom 's blue set of Bible stories . <p> My mother was not entirely certain that she approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild beasts , and she felt that " missionary " was far from the wisest career objective , whereas my mind was filled with pictures of fabulously decorated men and women , unconverted heathens , ready to drop to their knees , a picture no doubt influenced by the National Geographic . <p> One day , after the class had been led to Father Millerton 's living room , after our cookies and punch and stories and songs and prayers , and after the last of the other students had departed with their mothers , my mother still had not come and I was left with Father Millerton . <p> Father Millerton set a fresh package of cookies on the floor in front of me . " Well , " he said , " so it 's just the two of us . " He sat down on the floor , crossing his legs Indianstyle . With a sigh of relief he removed the white clerical collar . He winked at me . " I told Father Chadwick I 'd wear it , " he said , " but you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Good boy . " <p> He tore open the bag of cookies and motioned that I should help myself . " Now we can get to know one another , " he said . " I 'd like to get to know each of you children . Jesus loved little children . Did you know that ? " <p> " He is the shepherd , and I am his lamb , " I said , repeating a lesson learned that very day . <p> " Yes ! Absolutely ! " Father Millerton beamed . He slapped his knees , and the cigar ash rose in a cloud , then resettled on his not-so-black pants . " We are all Jesus ' lambs . Did you know that ? Yes ? I ask you now , do I look like a lamb , hey ? " <p> " No , " I said , slapping my knees as well . At this moment Father Millerton looked even more like the demon-possessed swine than I had remembered . <p> " Of course I do n't , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He tugged at one ear . " A pig maybe . " When I did n't say anything , eating a cookie instead , he ate one also , and then I ate another one . <p> WE TALKED for a while of baseball , of Father Millerton 's favorite team , the Dodgers , two years in town , ripped from the womb of Brooklyn . They had lately won the National League pennant , and Father Millerton was full of praise for his champions , the pitchers Don Drysdale and Johnny Podres , outfielders Duke Snider and Wally Moon . This last player Father Millerton talked about the most , his insideout swing sending high pop flies-Moon shots-just over the short outfield fence of Memorial Coliseum . <p> " He has used all of his God-given abilities , " he said , " and he is an example to us all . " <p> While Father Millerton talked baseball , I ate cookies . We were sitting in the middle of the living room floor . Mementos hung all around us . Religious scenes took up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph sold by his brothers to the Egyptians . On another wall commemorative plates , each one marking the opening of a world 's fair or the date of another Christmas , sat in rows on specially built shelves . On the far wall above a television set with a round picture tube hung the pictures of Father Millerton 's dead children and wife . The sons were dressed in their uniforms and refusing to smile . The daughter , much younger than the sons , looked pinched and uncomfortable , as if the disease that would claim her was already at its deadly work . The wife , on the other hand , was white-haired and hearty , and I was sorry that she was no longer alive . <p> " I see you 're looking at my family , " Father Millerton said . <p> " No , " I said , " not really . " Speaking of dead people always made me nervous , a nervousness that had its origins in my own near-death experience and was exacerbated by the funeral of my mother 's uncle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt that I had never seen him wear , and his sharp chin protruded above the rim of the open casket . <p> " They were the best family that a man could have , " Father Millerton was saying , " and they were so good , God took them away from me early so he could enjoy them all the more . " <p> " Mrs. Winter says that dead people get to see Jesus , " I said . Our teacher , Mrs. Winter , had taught this particular lesson on the occasion of the death of the class frog . " They get to see Jesus and watch what we 're doing . " <p> " You 're something of a scholar , I can see that already . " Father Millerton stood , moving in front of his pictures . " They 're watching us this very minute . I have to believe that . " <p> A chill went up and down my back , and my body shook so hard that I had to turn my head away from the family photographs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ' brow . <p> Suddenly , Father Millerton bellowed , " Do you believe , son ? I mean , do you really believe in what you say ? " He said this in a great , booming voice , and it was not just my imagination that heard the plates rattling on the walls . Now , I think that it was the voice he used in the Guianas , his own natural PA system used for preaching good news to the natives and savages , his words not to be lost in the buzz of the cooking fire or in the drone of insects . But then , in his living room , his voice startled me , and I edged backwards along the floor . Father Millerton grabbed me by the wrist . <p> " I ask you , " he said , his voice now a whisper , " do you believe ? " <p> " Yes , " I breathed . <p> " In what ? " Still the hush of seriousness . One hamlike hand brushed my cheek . " In what ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I croaked . <p> He exhaled as if he had been holding his breath . " Good , " he said , " good boy . " He scooped me up and carried me outside . The sun was bright and we both blinked . " The angels are rejoicing , Fish . Did you know that ? They 're having a party with cake and ice cream and cookies because of you . " He held me in his left arm and tweaked me on the cheek with his free hand . I giggled and we were better friends than we were before . <p> " There is joy in knowing Jesus . And you-with a name like yours-you must be one of his favorites . You know he fed multitudes with the meat of a few fish ? You should feel blessed . " <p> I was happy , it was true . I was very happy and light as air , buoyed up as I was in the arms of Father Millerton . I was very , very happy . But then , I was usually happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have . <p> " When I see the faith of children , " Father Millerton was saying , " I believe all the more . " <p> HE HAD WALKED to the rear of the house , and now we were facing the baseball diamond . To the left were the classrooms and , on the other side of the diamond , the church . The buzzer signaling two o'clock recess sounded in the classrooms , and children , all older than myself , poured from the flung-open doorways , choosing up sides for 15-minute games of kickball and freeze tag and jump rope . Two girls and a boy ran to Father Millerton . They grabbed his legs and the boy held onto his belt loops . There were others who made pig noises and pushed up their noses , but Father Millerton walked past them , paying them no heed . <p> " Do you know , " he said , sitting us down on one of the lunch tables , " do you know that Jesus said that if you have faith the size of a mustard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll move ? Or those palm trees over there-tell them to hop into the sea and they 'll do as they 're told ? How much faith do you need , what do you think ? Tell me that . " <p> One of the girls answered : " A mustard seed is very , very small . " <p> " And yet I have n't moved a tree in years , " Father Millerton said . " But then , maybe God has n't desired that to happen either . " He began to speak more to himself than to the four of us sitting clustered about him . " God 's wishes , " he said , " his wishes come first . " <p> I was watching the palm trees that surrounded the baseball diamond . They were waving in unison , timed by the breeze , swaying back and forth in the motion we used with our hula hoops , their shaved trunks bending , the ragged fringe underneath the new fronds catching the air like fingers . With all this movement I could well believe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation , then march the hour 's drive to the beach and the ocean . Anything was possible , for Father Millerton had said that it could be so . <p> " I once saw a Saramaccan native throw a rock at another man . The rock struck the man in the temple . He fell down with a groan and died . While some of the natives detained the man who had thrown the rock and others attempted to revive the victim , I heard-as if in words-God speak to me . Help the man up , ' he said . No , Lord , ' I said , for I saw the breath go out of him , he 's dead as a doorknob , he 's dead as my daughter back in Illinois . ' Raise him up , ' I heard . There were no audible words , I 'm sure , but I knew . I knew in my heart what God 's direction was to be . Yet like Jonah , I tarried , a victim of doubt . Raise him up , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish ere I avoided the Lord 's command . <p> " I walked to the little group huddled around the corpse . His mother was wailing and striking herself on her breasts and shoulders . I touched her and said , Everything is all right . ' She did n't understand me , of course , because I spoke in English , but she stood up . I grabbed her son 's cold and lifeless hand , my own heart filled with a heavy doubt , but obeying God nonetheless . Jesus , Jesus , Jesus , ' I said , and I felt the blood rush back into this young man 's limbs , hot and vital . He scrambled to his feet , a dazed look on his face-as if to say , Where have I been ? I 've gone and come back again ' - and by nightfall the entire village had come to know the Lord Jesus . " <p> We all gasped and the other boy said , " Wow . " <p> " You children have the power of pure belief , unshaken by doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saints and you must work to preserve your youth . " <p> The buzzer was sounding , marking the end of recess and the beginning of the last period of classes . The other boy and the two girls began to move away reluctantly . Each one of them said , " Goodbye , Father Millerton . " They touched him , and one of the girls even did a little curtsy . <p> I was sitting on his spacious lap , my head resting against the black of his shirt , seeing once again the dead native who popped back into a new life . This made me think of the dead , white-haired wife trapped behind the glass of the picture frame . <p> " Maybe Mrs. Millerton could come back , " I said . He smiled . " I think about it at night , " he said . " But no . Even Wally Moon must have his talent joined with God 's wish before he can hit a home run . " <p> " Maybe you could go to her , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smile was disappearing . " That 's the more likely story , is n't it ? " <p> Across the baseball diamond , Father Chadwick , wearing his black suit coat even in the afternoon heat , walked toward us , the last milling children giving him wide berth . When he had reached the lunch tables , he stopped in front of us , refusing Father Millerton 's invitation to " a seat and a discussion . " <p> " Father , " Chadwick said , " what have you been telling these children ? " <p> " The truth , Father , " Father Millerton said . <p> " I 'll have you know that I just now overheard two of your young disciples telling the other children that they could make the mountains disappear . " <p> " Overheard out of context , I 'm sure . " <p> " Telling war stories again , h 'm ? " <p> " They are not war stories , " Father Millerton said quietly . " They are the exact record of my ministry in the jungle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Father Chadwick ignored his older colleague , and turning to me , he said , " Fish , your mother called . She 's had difficulties with her car , and I 'll be taking you home . " He began to pry me away from Father Millerton 's shoulder . " And you , " he said , addressing the older man , " I would ask you to remember that you are the chaplain of this school and not a proselytizer for your own brand of mysticism . " <p> " God is inside you , and his power is at your discretion , " Father Millerton whispered in my ear as my fingers were persuaded to let go . <p> Father Chadwick led me across the baseball field to the rear of the church and the parking lot . Once , as we walked , I turned to see that Father Millerton had remained seated on the lunch bench , carefully unwrapping the cellophane from a cigar . His black shirt was open and collarless , and his white hair was blowing in the wind . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his car . Then I was warned not to stand with my arms hooked over the back of the front seat . Nor was I allowed to put my shoes on the seat 's upholstery . But I was to tell Father Chadwick everything . <p> " Do n't take him too seriously , " he said when I had finished my dramatic retelling of the native and the rock . " Old people do n't always mean what they say . You have to listen politely , but you do n't have to believe them . " <p> " I believe him , " I said . <p> " But you do n't have to , " my mother said later that afternoon . " You ca n't always believe every story you hear . Sometimes stories are meant to be enjoyed , but no one believes that they 're true . " <p> I did not say anything to her then , but I spent the evening with Carla Benson , telling her of the palm trees that could walk , if God were to will it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at school all day , but Father Millerton was not . He had been relieved of all duties and placed in the diocesan retirement facility . A short time later he died , and my parents did not tell me until I had begun to ask for his address so I could write . I thought of him often . The church had suffered financial difficulties , and Father Chadwick , in addition to his regular church duties , was forced to live in the parsonage and serve as school chaplain . We learned no more songs and we were told no more stories except for forgettable ones involving talking bunnies and moralistic cows . <p> ' It was an election year in 1960 , and my parents-who held very definite views-watched each of the televised debates . They bemoaned Nixon 's waxy looks as opposed to Kennedy 's youth and obvious vitality . <p> " It 's not a fair fight , " my father said , " putting this stuff on television . Next thing you 'll know we 'll be electing actors instead of lawyers . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my father opposed the creeping tide of socialism at home and abroad ; Nixon was the man to put a stop to that sort of nonsense . My mother was suspicious of Kennedy 's Vatican connection . As my father said , it would be bad enough to turn the country over to immigrant bootlegging Irish . It could only get worse by handing it on to a bunch of ritual-burdened Italians . He 'd had enough of it to know . <p> The morning after the election , my mother woke me with her tears , and I immediately prayed that the right man had been chosen . That my mother would cry given the outcome of a presidential election is maybe surprising now-it was not then , our nuclear then , when a political choice could alter the fate of the world . My mother was sitting in the den , sniffling into a wad of Kleenex , watching the latest election news coverage . When the results became increasingly clear , my mother sniffled all the more . I told her that she should not worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests . <p> I put my head in her lap . My mother combed my hair with her fingers , and I felt the wetness of her damp Kleenex on my neck . " When you pray , " she sighed , " you need to pray when it 'll do some good . You should have been praying a long time ago , when people were making up their minds . " <p> The thought occurred to me then that God might not work with time in quite the way we do , but I remained silent on the subject . Instead I said , " Do n't worry , someone will shoot him . " <p> The words jumped out of my mouth , stillborn in the air . I had no idea where they had come from , though I knew they were true , and I was afraid of what consequences they might bring once voiced . <p> " You do n't mean that , " my mother said . " I do n't much care for his politics , but I do n't wish for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that my hands had held the gun even if they had n't pulled the trigger , my initiation into a world where faith and guilt , knowledge and power are equal . And constantly at war . <p> Author Affiliation
