In Spain , the International Brigades join ranks one last time // The images of young men that were everywhere in Madrid early last November-erected in respectful displays , handed out with somber programs-bore that inimitable look ordinary young men had in the 1930s : the stark , blackand-white boniness against backgrounds of flat sunlight . Young , hopeful , often happy figures , never on tanks or armored vehicles or with any kind of advanced weaponry-one sees that clearly now-always on foot , clutching ancient rifles , in the dirt outside a dusty pueblo or against a shell-pocked wall , soccer-team style , one row standing , one row kneeling , as if the game were already won , victory theirs ; they and what they fought for , seen in simple blackand-white . The hundreds of old men that some of those young men lived to be were scattered throughout the huge lobby of the Hotel Convencion in midtown Madrid , and as I moved among them I felt an immediate and startling kinship , though I 'd never met any of them . Most spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political beliefs I long ago ceased to share . Yet they were dear to me . I applauded their faint air of victory . I was deeply , incomprehensibly , happy for them . Throughout the wet , mournful afternoon the reason for this almost familial feeling eluded me . Then , talking to the British contingent-their gnarled , working-class faces like bas-relief pilgrims on a late-Gothic cathedral-I understood : these men were the comrades of my dead father . There was n't one among these 370 old soldiers with whom he would n't have felt utter solidarity . He would have known exactly why they did what they did , on a level so profound it could never be adequately expressed-these men and what they fought for , in simple black-and-white . They found out soon enough that there was nothing simple about the Spanish Civil Warnot in their retreat , not in their defeat , not in their homecoming . For the rest of their lives , the mad , Byronic , utterly decent decision they made to die , if necessary , to stop fascism would be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps , blacklisted , ostracized , driven to poverty , suicide , and oblivion-often in the name of the very principles they 'd tried to defend . The only ones for whom things turned out to be simple are still lying beneath the tawny dust of Spain . My father did n't fight in the Spanish Civil War , but it was the defining war of his life . He referred to it all the time , and with a passion he never evinced for the Battle of Britain and the grim , crepuscular triumph to which it eventually led . A fierce and lifelong pacifist , he put aside his convictions when World War II broke out . He signed up for the RAF with little emotion ; that war was so vast and complex , he said , the motivations of even the good guys so compromised , that he never had much feeling for it . " We needed a fascist to beat the fascists , " he once told me . " Churchill was our Hitler . " Of the danger and privation of being constantly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like going to work in a factory . " But three years earlier his pacifism had prevented him from fighting for the Republican cause in Spain . That was a clear moral quandary that haunted him all his life . When , in the early Sixties , I became infatuated with the country , he regarded my enthusiasm as a betrayal . Spain was then still firmly in the fist of Francisco Franco , Et Caudillo , and my father was appalled that I could travel there so blithely while he , because of " principles " that permasked his shame or anger at himself , could never go . A few miles southeast of Madrid , several hundred people , eighteen buses , and two ambulances are gathered along one overgrown bank of the Jarama River , by the remains of the Arganda Bridge . The narrow , iron spanwhich would n't look out of place crossing some backwoods creek in rural Pennsylvaniaseems too insubstantial to have been a vital link in the survival of anything . Two modern trucks could n't pass on it at once . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of their city has been obliterated by an autovia . All that remains are two stubby spurs a few yards long at each end of the span , forlorn beside the wide sweep of the superhighway , truncated , irrelevant , leading nowhere . Milton Wolff climbs a reviewing stand overlooking the Jarama . He is eighty , six foot two , with a voice you can imagine emerging from an old-time Brooklyn cabbie at a Dodgers game . It is November 5 , 1996 , the second day of tributes and festivities for the surviving members of the International Brigades , the 40,000 volunteers from more than fifty countries who came to Spain in 1936 and 1937 to make the first stand against fascism . " Let me say to the men and women who fought here , " he bellows , " it is not Spain that owes us a vote of gratitude . It is we who honor and express our gratitude to the Spanish people for the opportunity to resist fascism . " Old hands leave walkers , wheelchairs , the arms of friends and lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the middle distance across the busy autovia , crumbly bluffs rise several hundred feet from the plain , a long rifle-shot from the bridge . On these heights fewer than sixty years ago , Franco 's troops were massed , poised to cut the only road connecting Republican Madrid to Valencia and the rest of Republican Spain . " No pasaran ! " ( " They shall not pass " ) had already become the great battle cry of the civil war in the defense of Madrid ; Franco 's Nationalist troops , spearheaded by Moorish regulars and the Nazi air force 's Condor Legion , did n't pass at Jarama either-in large part because of the extraordinary tenacity of the International Brigades . The 600-man British Battalion bore the brunt of the initial assault , losing two thirds of its men and almost all its officers . A week or so into the battle , the 450 men of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion-many of them students , all with only the most rudimentary training-were brought up for the first time . Within days , 127 of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old men walk out along the bridge . It bears a none-too-recent coat of bilious paint . A little knot of Irish folk centered around a patriarchal brigadista named Michael O'Riordan make their way across , a lone fiddler at their head . They sing as they go . O'Riordan 's eight-year-old grandson marches solemnly in front of his grandpa . He knows the lyrics . But this is as martial as things get . Mostly the old men amble forward in twos and threes , quiet , contemplative . A few yards from the reviewing stand , a tiny , eighty-five-year-old Parisian named Emmanuel Mink has stripped naked to the waist . He is babbling in French , shivering so hard in the sharp breeze that he hardly makes sense . He points at the ground and then to a deep cleft , a scar , in the loose old skin of his back . " Here on this very spot " - he grins- " I was shot sixty years ago . " He 's smiling and nodding , as happy as a clam . He turns his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tattoo he got for his pains , in Auschwitz . The 127 American kids who died to hold this place had been in Spain for only a few weeks . They had no more familiarity with the country , its terrain , or its people than the average tourist . " Armed tourists , " in fact , is what Winston Churchill called them . Inspired by the dynamic politics of the Depression , inflamed by the atrocities of the pious Franco 's troops ( killing the wounded in their hospital beds , castrating the dead , raping and mutilating women ) , they had defied their country 's laws , jumped on board transatlantic ships , been smuggled across the Pyrenees , given out-ofdate weapons , and ordered to fight the most hardened troops in Spain . All too soon they were heaps of meat in the winter rain . What made them do it ? " I was a progressive-an antifascist , " says Nick Pappas , a genial old rogue from Los Angeles , who sounds uncannily like Anthony Quinn . " So I was never liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't follow the bible-The Daily Worker . " The Daily Jerker , " I called it . " Pappas is something of a standout among the old warriors : he sports a widebrimmed leather hat , moves of his own volition , and is exuberantly irreverent about the proceedings . The cascade of speechifying about the lofty motives of the brigadistas , much of it Marxist , does n't do a whole lot for Pappas . " Hey , it was a period in the United States when one in three workers was out of work . The thinking of a young man like me was , " There 's no future in this world . ' So a lot of people said , " I 'll go to Spain and fight against fascism , and we 'll defeat them and stay there and make it our home . " ' As for the youthful idealism that is being sentimentalized on all sides , Pappas says , " The only real , sincere idealism comes from the very ignorant , from the " willing slaves . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it 's put to the test . " Pappas earned the right to talk this way-in every major engagement the Internationals fought , right up to the bitter defeat at the Battle of the Ebro in the summer of 1938 . But Jarama holds particularly dark memories . One of the 127 ghosts who haunt the narrow bridge was his kid brother , Philip , " twenty years old , killed in the first week . " When he tells me this , the jovial old guy suddenly goes dumb with grief . His big Hellenic head slumps forward as if he 'd been shot in the heart . Milt Wolff did n't need to come to Spain . " I was working in the garment district , doing very well financially . But how could you say no ? " He was also a pacifist who " was n't going to kill anybody . " He volunteered to be a medic , but a combination of inspiration-a black machinegun commander named Walter Garland-and distaste- " there was an American doctor who lectured the troops on " venereal disease as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a machine-gun company . He fought first at Brunete , west of Madrid , the next major battle after Jarama and a bloody defeat for the Republicans . He quickly discovered one advantage of being a machine gunner : " It made me so deaf I could n't hear all the big political speeches the Communists made . " Like Pappas , he stuck it out through every horror Franco and Republican army incompetence threw at him to become one of the fiercest and most admired fighters in the line . Poet Edwin Rolfe said of him : " He was intelligent , egalitarian , blunt and fearless . " The Spanish troops called him El Lobo-The Wolf . Within a year the ex-pacifist had become commander of the Lincoln Battalion . His friend Hemingway thought him the best it ever had . He was twenty-two years old . Hanging over all the reverent celebration is the inescapable historical fact that these old men fought on the losing side . This is not to say that they fought on the wrong side or that they were defeated by the winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American combatants-they were defeated as much by their own governments back home as by Franco . Britain , France , and other European democracies scrupulously observed a policy of nonintervention toward Republican Spain but blatantly ignored the intervention of the fascist powers on behalf of Franco . The practical result was that the democracies refused to sell or transport arms to the Republican government , while Germany , Italy , and Portugal flooded the Nationalists with state-of-the-art weaponry . Furthermore , as New York Times reporter Herbert Matthews pointed out in his book on the conflict , " business and financial interests everywhere saw their cause best served by a Franco victory . Powerful lobbies in Paris , London , and Washington operated against the Republicans . Credits extended to the Franco regime were as helpful as soldiers . American oil shipments to it were invaluable . " Photograph LINCOLN-WASHINGTON BATTALION MACHINE-GUN OFFICERS . MILTON WOLFF APPEARS AT UPPER LEFT . STANDING NEXT TO HIM IS NICK PAPPAS // The Spanish Civil War was a war of many firsts . It was the first time a real stand had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atavistic ethnic passions to the impersonal efficiency of technology . It was the first time many techniques of modem warfare were employed on human targets . Italy and especially Germany were quite open about using Spain and its people as a proving ground for new weapons and their fledgling air forces-notably in Guernica in 1937 , the first time in history that civilians were subjected to saturation bombing from the air . And it was the first time the Western powers demonstrated that they could tolerate dictators-provided they did n't become too ambitious-in the larger cause of combating Communism . For the men and women on the ground who became the victims of this larger cause , the basic issues were obvious . The unthinkable atrocities committed in the name of Communism must be separated from the profound appeal of its core message : people have a right to be free of oppressive power ; people come before property . However corruptible in practice , the yearning for social justice can fire the blood as no other political emotion . That 's why young men and women , Communist or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Civil War was etched so deeply into the consciousness of those-like my father-who felt they could n't go . For the first time-perhaps in history but certainly for this generation-the battle lines between the power of people and the power of property were crystal clear . Which in turn is why everyone , Spaniard or foreigner , who believed in the power of people was doomed . Photograph FREDERICO BORRELL GARCIA , AT CENTER , WAS KILLED SHORTLY AFTER THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN . HIS DEATH WAS CAPTURED IN ROBERT CAPA 'S FAMOUS PHOTO OF A FALLING SOLDIER // Franco was the kind of general who liked to command his troops from a safe distance . Once his enemies had laid down their arms , he got much braver . Mass executions , or limpieza ( " cleansing " ) , of prisoners and political foes were routine during the war ; mass executions of rojos ( " Reds " ) multiplied afterward . So brutal was his suppression of Madrid that Mussolini 's foreign minister was actually shocked by it . Franco continued to wage war on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , according to Gerald Brenan 's book Spanish Labyrinth , and executing thousands more . Only in 1943 , when it became clear that the Axis was losing the war , did Franco let up , no doubt concerned that he might one day be held accountable . He never was . With the Axis crushed , the United States and NATO turned their attention to the larger cause of containing Soviet Communism , and by 1953 the little butcher was back in business , with five American air bases and a vast American naval base on the Atlantic coast . The fate of the Internationals mirrored that of the Republicans . Disbanded in 1938 in a vain attempt to " de-internationalize " the war , some brigadistas found their way home , and a few had successful careers ( e.g. , Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia ) . Many fought fascism in World War II but were distrusted by their commanders . Major Milton Wolff , despite his rank and long combat experience , was not allowed to complete officer candidate school . But many Internationals had a more summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they were herded into concentration camps . During the Nazi occupation , they were used as slave labor or simply sent to the gas chambers . The evening after the ceremony at the bridge , I 'm standing at the bar of an eatery next to the Hotel Convencion called El Parador de Jamon ( The Ham Inn ) , which serves every cured-pork product known to the Iberian peninsula . Two brigadistas speaking a Slavic language hobble in on canes for a nightcap and occupy one end of the bar . At the other end is a sixtyish , barrel-bellied beer drinker with a white mustache and a neat dark suit . The young bartender leans over and asks him if he feels solidaridad with the two old geezers . Barrel-belly launches into a virulent tirade about the week 's tribute : Why would anyone honor this foreign scum ? Why did n't they stay home and kill their own people ? The organizers are traitors who ought to have their throats cut like pigs . The brigadistas sip their drinks , oblivious . The bartender and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriot . He 's purple with rage . He 's leaving his drink , swaying down the bar toward his adversaries . The bartender gets nervous . He starts shushing the guy . He does n't shush . " If I had a machine gun , " he yells at the brigadzst ( ls , " I 'd go over the hotel right now and mow you cocksuckers down-cut your fucking nuts off . That 's the way we do it in Spain , assholes , cut your fucking nuts off and throw you in a ditch . . . " The two old guys finish their drinks and start working their way to the door . Either they 're really cool or they 're really hard of hearing . They pass the boozed-up bozo without a glance and disappear . He turns back to his drink . For one long , embarrassed moment , The Ham Inn is utterly silent . The official Spanish line on the civil war is that its wounds have healed , that it has passed into passion-free history . The conflict is taught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been little more than a somewhat disorderly transfer of power . The consensus seems to be that it would be best if future generations never again subscribed to what Gerald Brenan identified as the conflict 's prime cause : " the Spanish belief , shared by almost every element in the country , in violent remedies . " One outcome of the official line was a resolution passed in 1995 by the Congress of Deputies ( the lower chamber of the Spanish Parliament ) that surviving members of the International Brigades be offered Spanish citizenship . The Republican government had made this pledge to the brigades when they were disbanded in 1938-a uniquely Spanish gesture that combined arrogance ( Spanish citizenship is preferable to any other ) , practicality ( many brigadistas , for example , Germans , Italians , Eastern European Jews , were exiles without a country ) , and poetry ( what more heartfelt gift could the Spanish offer than roots in the very soil these men and women had crossed oceans to defend ? ) . At a farewell parade in November 1938 , Communist leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " When the olive tree of peace blooms again , " she cried to the departing brigades , " come back . " Because it is high above sea level and dry , Madrid is often bathed with a light of preternatural brilliance . The day after the ceremony at the bridge is one of those days . The ancient faces sparkle as they converge on the Palacio del Congreso . This morning is to be the literal enactment of the weeklong Homenaje a Los Voluntarios de la Libertad ( " Homage to the Volunteers of Freedom " ) , a ceremony in which the government will honor them and accept them as Spanish . This is what drew them here . For most it will probably be their last reunion , their last breath of bright Spanish air , their last chance to tread the ground they fought on . The political nit-picking and bureaucratic hand-wringing are irrelevant now . Finally , after more than half a century of rejection and recrimination , someone is thanking them . Actually , the organizers and their allies in the government have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( What , for example , will happen to those from countries , such as the United States , that do not recognize dual citizenship ? ) The answer is a classic instance of si-pero-no ( " yes-but-no " ) . The brigadistas are to receive a kind of honorary citizenship-a certificate that entitles them to future citizenship should they choose to exercise the option . " A peculiar document , " says one Homenaje organizer , a distinguished Spanish gentleman with long experience in the vagaries of government . " At least they 'll get a bit of paper with colors . " Another problem is that former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 's Socialists-who passed the original resolution-lost the last election to the conservative Partido Popular , which , not surprisingly , stresses its future as the party of corporate growth while playing down its visceral links to the fascist past . Inside the Palacio del Congreso the narrow halls of power are in chaos . There is an enormous crush of media . After a wait of three hours , a brief ceremony has just been held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpressed : " We were herded into a large anteroom . It had great murals . The vice-president gave an address in Spanish , and one of the brigadistas replied . Then we went very slowly into the Chamber of Deputies , someone said some unintelligible words , and we were all told to leave . It was a nonevent . There were a bunch of deputies who had their pictures taken . That was the only noteworthy thing . " The speakers , as well as those photographed , are all Socialists . The forward-looking PP has balked : all but two of the 150-odd conservative deputies have found more pressing engagements , notably the president of the Congress , Federico Trillo . ( Trillo , a fleshy-faced politico with the judgmental glare of an ambitious cleric , could in a pinch be termed the Iberian Newt Gingrich . ) His absence , on the slimmest of pretexts , incenses the Homenaje organizers . The next day , newspapers across the political spectrum will express varying degrees of outrage at the president 's discourtesy , ignorance , and lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A furious coordinator claims that Trillo , despite his excuses , has said privately that he " would not receive people who had killed his father 's friends . " When I try to get her name and source for this quote , she refuses and becomes quite terrified , blurting out that she is an anarquista and that her father was killed by Franco . Through the halls the aimless crush continues . The old men are everywhere , their sparkle gone . Some are trying to sit , exhausted ; others-walkers and canes superfluous-are being carried along by the crowd . None appear to be holding bits of paper with colors . In the Chamber of Deputies many are still scattered around its steeply raked concentric circles , tottering along rows of empty seats or leaning breathlessly on the railings . One elderly British woman has lapsed into a coma and is being attended to by two medics . ( She will die the next day without regaining consciousness . ) Back outside in the dazzling blue air , Jack Shafran has hooked up with his old pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " It was a bit insulting , " agrees Shafran . " I 've always bent over backwards to be nice to them . " The octogenarians crash off in search of lunch , the slight already forgotten . For veterans of a dozen real and political wars , the collective tantrum of Franco 's yuppie heirs is very small beer . The brigadistas ' sense of honor is too deep to be tarred by such posturing . Long ago they embraced the battles that went with the lifechanging decision they 'd made . The sad absurdity of victorious old soldiers does not cling to these men . Their bearing is not military . Even in the deep twilight of their lives , their fading eyes twinkle with a profound disrespect for authority . A woman from the BBC notices that quite a few have come with considerably younger female companions , few of them wives . These men are of a different temper than what we think of as veterans . They are n't respectable , they are n't pillars of the community ; in their act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the century 's true enemy . They chose to go to war and never got a hero 's welcome . It seems to have given them an untouchable serenity . Contemplating them is like sitting beneath ancient trees . They are not defeated . Madrid 's Palacio de los Deportes ( " Sports Palace " ) is a short wheelchair run from the Hotel Convencion . A concert has been arranged in honor of the brigadistas-a high point in the week 's festivities , and throughout the Palacio , a ubiquitous neo-Soviet poster perfectly typifies the earnestness of the Homenaje organizers : semi-representational , it shows an old man with a heavily lined face in a heroic , combative pose . He is mostly bald . His impossibly muscular right arm ends in a determined fist . His left hand holds aloft his heart , which he has apparently just removed from a heart-shaped hole in his chest . It 's an uncomfortable tribute to men in their eighties-an evocation less of passionate commitment than of open-heart surgery . The concert threatens to be just as well-intentioned . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headliner Paco Ibanez , a fine flamenco singer named Carmen Linares , a very serious folkie named Jose Antonio Labordeta , and Imanol , a Basque singer of whom I 've never heard but who could well belong to a Basque branch of the Celtic-moan school . It 's not quite as heavy-duty as an Amnesty International benefit , but there 's a definite Neil Young-Jackson Browne-Sinead O'Connor potential . If it were being held in L.A. , this concert would be called Brig-Aid . The Palacio holds 12,000 people . Tonight there will be about 370 brigadistas and perhaps half again as many friends and relatives . So far , the week 's events seem to have drawn as little public interest as the American presidential election , which , coincidentally , will be decided tonight . So it 's a surprise to round the corner and find an angry , milling crowd of about a thousand people in the mini-plaza outside the Palacio , held back from its glass doors by barricades . Young men are jumping the barricades and hammering furiously on the doors . Inside , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt Spanish petty officials love to assume . The theme of the evening already seems to be " No pasaran . " The press is still allowed to pass . The concert has already started and the main body of the stadium is full . As I climb the concrete steps to the galleries , I can hear the soaring flamenco lament of Carmen Linares . Against all expectations , my skin begins to prickle with emotion . As I push through the packed gallery , this sensation balloons . The concert ca n't have been going for more than ten minutes , but the place is on fire . The passion is palpable , a heavy intoxicating aroma you practically taste as you inhale . Linares is singing a song with only marginal relevance to the proceedings ( it 's about the Pope and two lovers and whether a kiss is a sin ) , but the audience is ole-ing every jagged , drawn-out phrase she rips from her soul , as if it were another stake to drive through El Caudillo 's heart . Here the anniversarial aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge . Exactly sixty years ago , Franco 's Nazi bombers were hammering the streets and parks and buildings outside-his own capital , which he had vowed to destroy rather than leave to the rojos . On the radio , a Republican deputy named Fernando Valera was drawing the battle lines : " Here in Madrid , " he said , " two incompatible civilizations undertake their great struggle : love against hate , peace against war , the fraternity of Christ against the tyranny of the church .... Madrid is fighting for Spain , for humanity , for justice , and with the mantle of its blood it shelters all human beings ! Madrid ! Madrid ! " The Nationalist forces were already massed on the sprawling campus of University City a few kilometers to the northwest . On November 9 , 1936 , many of the bald and gray-haired old foreigners down in the front six rows fought Franco 's soldiers hand-to-hand in Madrid 's streets and labs and lecture halls . The day before , in Herbert Matthews 's words , " they paraded with revolutionary songs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where most of them died in the next ten days . " But dead and living held the line . Passion and fire are quotidian commodities in Spain , routine in the bullring as well as the bar , or for that matter at the tollbooth , but the emotion swirling through this stadium is of a special intensity . It does n't spring entirely from the past . What 's burning the joint up is n't nostalgia or regret . The brooding , faintly celebratory mood at the bridge has given way to something far more inchoate and of the moment : unfinished business , a call to future battle . It 's too dark to characterize the several thousand people down on the floor , but the occupants of the galleries , many thousand more , are overwhelmingly young-men and women who look to be in their twenties . They 're not here just to listen to the music , for they applaud thunderously every reference to a sixty-year-old war . When Labordeta-a dour , unmoving little figure-starts into his " Cancion de la Libertad " ( " Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing along , bouncing the roof of the stadium on its struts . Beside me a tall , skinny kid barely out of his teens has pushed his way to the rail to sing . He has a shock of curly , black hair and a mouthful of strong , white teeth . It occurs to me that Milton Wolff must have looked a lot like him sixty years ago . Suddenly he starts bellowing : " Espana ! Manana ! Sera Republicana ! " ( " Tomorrow Spain Will Be Republican ! " ) The cry is picked up across the galleries , then down on the floor . The stadium rocks with its message of menace and yearning . Thousands of young fists pump the air . Everywhere people are weeping . Down in front , the sedate rows of old warriors are literally moved-white handkerchiefs dabbing under spectacles , old shoulders shaking , faces buried in wrinkled hands . I 'm having trouble not weeping myself , though for what I 'm not quite sure-perhaps because political passion like this seems irretrievably lost in my life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these old men must once have been , by the justness of this cause and the inevitability of its triumph .
