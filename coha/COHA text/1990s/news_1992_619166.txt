<p> Public broadcasting and good architecture usually do n't mix , but KQED in San Francisco and KPFA in Berkeley have moved into new homes that are tremendous improvements over the cramped , makeshift  --  even squalid  --  premises where they somehow managed to put programs on the air for 40 years . <p> Neither of the new stations is an architectural marvel , except to its overjoyed occupants . But each in its own way is a very decent job , done on a budget that was adequate though hardly extravagant . <p> KQED , an expanding conglomerate which includes local PBS TV Channel 9 , a radio station ( KQED FM-88.5 ) , the thriving glossy magazine San Francisco Focus , and a large marketing and fund-raising department , had long outgrown its warren of improvised structures along 8th Street . <p> REMARKABLY SPACIOUS <p> Now KQED enjoys a $ 25 million highly organized " professional " environment specifically tailored to its needs . The new centralized headquarters , carved out of a block-long South-of-Market warehouse at 2601 Mariposa Street , is high-ceilinged and remarkably spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been subtly but nicely enriched with a new entrance and changed window shapes , and otherwise given a dignified coat of vandal-resistant beige and gray paint . <p> The interior , on the other hand , has been gutted and rebuilt to standards close to those of the commercial networks , not only in the big corporate office spaces but in the state-of-the-art production facilities . <p> The main TV studio , at 33 feet high , can accommodate virtually any programs KQED chooses to originate , if it ever ends its almost total dependence on other PBS stations and the BBC . <p> Tiny by comparison with this behemoth of electronic culture , KPFA ( FM-94.1 ) is a radio station only , radically populist in approach and long inured to poverty in upstairs rooms on Shattuck Avenue . <p> To the incredulity of the staff and numerous volunteers , it is now ensconced in a spirited little anti- Establishment temple . Substantially financed by private foundations and rich individual lefties ( but , unlike KQED , by choice without a dime from business corporations ) , it cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just north of University Avenue at 1929 Martin Luther King Jr . Way . <p> DISSIMILAR IN OUTLOOK <p> Architecture , of course , can not fail to express the differences between these operations , which are as dissimilar in outlook as in size . <p> There is no question which got the more inspired design . KPFA , smaller and poorer , was able to satisfy its relatively modest needs in a charming building by the Berkeley firm of Denny Abrams and Richard Milliken . The project designer was young David Trachtenberg , then on their staff , who has since opened his own office . <p> Apart from a gabled , half-classical facade that need n't be taken seriously , although its retrograde historicism seems at odds with the station 's avowed " progressive " ideals , the rest of the building turns out to a creditable piece of regionalist Modern architecture , meant for the balmy Bay Area . <p> The interior is almost residential in scale , intimately organized around a two-story atrium sporting a retractable skylight . <p> This lofty hall , 30 feet high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to an elating view of the station 's transmission tower , which lifts 50 feet higher above the roof as a rational technological sculpture . <p> Around the perimeter of the atrium on the upper level are a variety of offices and meeting rooms , which are usually open in a welcoming way . The lower level consists largely of broadcasting studios and control rooms that are of necessity closed . They are incomparably superior to KPFA 's previous facilities , but there is no attempt to achieve technical perfection at the expense of human vagaries . <p> People with plenty of hair  --  their T-shirts emblazoned with uplifting slogans  --  seem always to be milling about , sometimes munching bagels from a table in the entrance hall set with high-calorie goodies . <p> BERKELEYAN FLAVOR <p> So there is a wonderful friendliness about this tabernacle of funky left-wing politics , obscure ethnic music , and bellicose feminism of a distinct Berkeleyan flavor . <p> Although the staff made an effort at serious housekeeping in the beginning , they have since relaxed into a cheery bohemianism . Cables are liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no-no , and after a few months the place has a very lived-in look , rather like a commune . <p> But the building is designed to take hard use . The exposed structure is simply framed in fir . The colors are warm . The concrete floor is stained a soft umber . The Sheetrock walls are painted a faux terra cotta , which recalls the deeper earth colors of the facade outside that are deftly set off by green tile . <p> So KPFA is a modest instant landmark , unprepossessing but with a clear identity on a nondescript street . KQED , on the other hand , hardly stands out in its industrial surrounding . Originally built in 1986 as a bare-bones " condo " warehouse , but never used before it was purchased by KQED , the building fronts calmly on a muni trolley-bus storage yard across the street , which at long last is being fenced to ward off the Michelangelos of the nocturnal graffiti gangs . <p> Yet KQED also has an unmistakable civic presence . An Art Deco-ish fin projecting above the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak compared to the overall mass of this once-featureless block of a building which has been enlivened by new rows of high and low windows . Fitted flush to the concrete walls , the sensitively proportioned big panes of glass set up a fine geometric rhythm along the side elevations . <p> CHILLING EFFECT <p> One only wishes that there had been some more money to do the interior with the same touch of class . In spite of generous contributions by corporations , foundations , and individuals  --  most notably Madeleine Haas Russell  --  there is a somewhat chilling effect in the spartan entry . <p> That is partly because of the need for security in a neighborhood that can be rough , but also because of inexpensive materials that could look all right in a small building like KPFA 's . But they simply look cheap in a large structure that because of its very bulk can not escape a certain monumentality . <p> In fact , the detailing verges on parsimony . And as soon as one ascends to the main floor by elevator ( there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor ) , the bleakness of the two-story main hall comes as a decided shock . <p> The space measures no less than 30 feet high to its skylight , and more than 150 long , but it seems oddly pinched . That 's because the huge curving wall on the right , painted a strange yellow , bears a startling resemblance to the hull of a ship that seems to have crashed through the outside wall and come to rest when it bumped into the end of the hall . <p> Someone wickedly called this " the Titanic School of Architecture , " and it is passing curious what the architects , Gensler &; Associates , were thinking about when they concocted such an enormous surface , which is broken only once , close to the bow , by the window of the office of KQED 's chief Tony Tiano . <p> Even Tiano at his captain 's post of an ill-furnished office , however , has a view only of a bare and usually unpeopled space , where chairs and tables and plants are brought in only for parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the staff has an office directly overlooking this marine disaster , with its expanse of ugly vinyl flooring in several shades of speckled gray . <p> NO CONVICTION <p> It occurred to me that the architects had dimly recalled great curving walls of famous buildings , possibly the magnificent convex and concave surfaces of Le Corbusier 's chapel at Ronchamp . But at KQED there is no conviction behind the gesture , no joy in the space , no indications that we are in the heart of a vast communications enterprise , until we step into the studios on the left , or go up the stairs straight ahead to enter the upper level of well-lighted office spaces that are an exhilarating 19 feet from floor to floor . <p> Here the Gensler team , headed by Charles Kridler , Kevin Schaeffer , Robert Wheatley and John Scouffas , achieved something of the comfort and lucid organization of the sleeker commercial premises that the firm created elsewhere in the city for KPIX ( Channel 5 ) and KGO ( Channel 7 ) . <p> Incidentally , the Gensler organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactor of KQED over the years , sponsoring the " Great Performances " series and making a major pro bono contribution to the design of the new headquarters . <p> Yet the results lack pizzazz . Perhaps the fault lies somewhere between the architecture and the mood of KQED 's top management , for I have rarely seen drier spaces for so-called creative people this side of engineering firms . <p> Everything is done correctly , to be sure . The high and low windows , so handsome on the exterior , here make excellent sense by breaking up the long walls and varying the quality of light . The main spaces are filled with staff workstations . Glassed-in offices for managers and other types who need privacy are farthest from the windows , along the inner walls . <p> But the fun of KPFA  --  or even of KQED before Tiano took over  --  seems to have evaporated . There is a disturbing thought , indeed , that at KQED  --  as federal support for public broadcasting diminishes  --  the distance between commercial and noncommercial broadcasting is narrowing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff only moved in a month or so ago , and has hardly had the chance to give the place a less impersonal quality . There are plants , let alone art on the walls . The shake- down cruise , to borrow another nautical term , has just begun . But the voyage is under way . <p> Something like 250 people are putting on TV and radio programs , producing a profitable ( tax-exempt ) magazine , raising funds , arranging educational activities for school children , and in a healthy change even originating a new local program  --  the talk show " Q. " <p> How well they do depends partly on the performance of the building  --  so large that there are expanses of unoccupied space  --  which offers extraordinary opportunities . For the moment , though , the perspective from Tiano 's isolated office is that of an unending McNeil-Lehrer show .
