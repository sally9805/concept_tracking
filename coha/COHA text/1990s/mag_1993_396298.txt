February 1993 : It 's a snowy day in Washington , D.C. , and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is wedged , jet black , into a white world . Water trickles down the face of the Wall , bumping over the names , one by one , and spilling onto a snow-covered bouquet of red roses . The Wall begs for the touch of a warm hand . But Diane Carlson Evans wo n't take her gloves off today . Her fingers have touched these men a thousand times in memory , in nightmares . She has held their hands , cleaned their wounds , stanched their blood , carried off their arms and legs in buckets , covered their faces . Evans turns away from the Wall and looks across the snow to a spot beyond the trees . " It 's so simple , " she says , pointing to the statue of three bronze fighting men who guard the entrance to the Wall . " We have a memorial for the men who returned from Vietnam . Why not one for the women ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there too . " From the earliest fighting in 1962 until the troops came home in 1973 , more than 11,000 U.S. military women served in Vietnam . Ninety percent were nurses in the U.S. Army , Navy , and Air Force . The rest were communications specialists , clerks , and air traffic controllers . Thousands more women were sent by the Red Cross , the USO , and other humanitarian organizations . The names of eight military women are carved into the Wall . ( Two more are still considered missing in action . An additional 20 civilian U.S. women were killed there . ) While the nation continues to debate the role of women in the military , the fact remains that in every war there have been women who  --  without the draft , without recruitment or even encouragement  --  have actively participated . Yet the statues at memorials have only been of men ; if female figures appear they are mythical . No matter how opposed to war we may be , most of us ca n't help but decry the fact that women 's involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11  --  Veterans Day  --  the nation 's first women 's war memorial will be dedicated in Washington , D.C. Commemorating the women who participated in the Vietnam war , it is one of approximately 40 statues honoring women in the U.S. And unlike the warriors portrayed in the men 's statue it faces at the opposite end of the Vietnam Wall , the women represented are noncombatants . The fact that this statue exists is a testament to one woman 's determination . For ten years , Diane Carlson Evans has campaigned for this memorial . When asked why , she simply says , " Because we were there too . " In 1966 Diane Carlson joined the Army Student Nurse Corps , and after completing her training requested duty in Vietnam . She says , " I knew I was needed there . " Two years later she was on her way . She did n't tell her family , who lived on a Minnesota dairy farm , that she was going until she had packed her bags and was ready to leave . She had just finished making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her parents as a gift , just in case . She was 21 . Evans bears an almost uncanny resemblance to Dana Delany , who starred as a young Army nurse in in Vietnam in TV 's China Beach . But , Evans is quick to point out , the show was far from her reality . Arriving in Vietnam in August 1968 , her first assignment was the 36th Evacuation Hospital in Vung Tau , a city on the South China Sea . Her unit 's 62 beds were filled with men  --  boys , really ; the average age of GIs in Vietnam was 19  --  whose wounds were like nothing she had ever seen or imagined in nursing school . Torsos without limbs . Bodies with nothing from the navel down . Skin shredded with shrapnel . Helicopters picked up the wounded and took them to hospitals before they had a chance to die . Nurses would do triage , deciding which men had a chance to live and which were " expectants " with no chance at all . Nurses worked 12-hour shifts , six days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies . Men would confiscate tampons to clean their guns . Birth control was unavailable and many women had to " go to the dentist " in Japan for secret abortions . Military women were raped . Sexual harassment was common , but the only time Evans ever experienced it personally was when she was ordered to wear her best dress and attend a party for generals and senior officers . " They treated us with respect , but I felt like I was pimped . " Despite orders , she refused to attend another . Less than six months after she arrived , Evans asked to be transferred to a unit that was closer to the fighting , so she could work with casualties right out of the field . The 71st Evacuation Hospital in Pleiku was called " Rocket City " because it was only 30 kilometers from the Cambodian border . There casualties would come in surges , making the emergency room an endless sea of blood and bodies . She describes frequent rocket attacks , stuffing GIs under the beds , holding Vietnamese babies burnt by napalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , the awful smell , hundreds of casualties arriving in a single week , working 16-hour shifts , deciding there was n't a God , abandoning her journal because no one would ever believe it . By the time Evans left , in August 1969 , she says she knew the war  --  all war  --  was wrong . But although she had heard a little about the protests going on back in " the world , " she was n't prepared for being blamed for it all : " People said I was oiling the war machine . " She , like many of the women who served , took refuge in the fact that she did n't fit the Vietnam vet stereotype and just melted into society . " Our way of dealing with it was not to deal with it , " Evans says . The nurses did n't call each other . They did n't tell anyone they had been there . Many of the nurses dove into civilian careers , overworking , trying to keep busy so there would be no time to remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , settled into a small midwestern town , and completely " forgot " what she had seen and felt in Vietnam . All the names . All the faces . Even when slabs of meat on a kitchen counter turned into young bodies in uniform and men with no faces would wake her in the middle of the night . Yet something pulled her to Washington the day the Wall was dedicated in 1982 . Unsure of what she was looking for or what she might find , she ran her fingers over thousands of names  --  all the men and women who had died during her tour of duty in 1968 and ' 69  --  straining to remember the names on the dogtags she had tried not to read , tried to forget . All around her were men who had come back less than whole . She put on the old khaki hat she had worn in Vietnam with the nurses ' pin on it and found men hugging her , crying , thanking her and all the nurses , for their lives . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . She spent a year in therapy . Memories trickled back painfully . Evans made another pilgrimage to the Wall . In the two years since her first visit , Frederick Hart 's more traditional statue of three fighting men had been approved , financed , and erected at the west entrance in tribute to the soldiers who served in Vietnam . Evans says : " As far as I was concerned , the Wall was complete . If it had stood alone , it would have been fine . But the three bronze men changed things . The country needed to know that we were there when they died . A lot of parents do n't know we were there , holding their hands . All we want is to be honored and remembered the same way men are . Nothing more . " Little did Evans imagine that she and a handful of other women would be facing a decade-long struggle to have that wish fulfilled . The reasons were complex and varied . Inherently , the Wall is a profoundly moving memorial that rebukes war . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire on the part of many to counter that message by putting up a traditional statue that honors warriors and glorifies militarism . When the women 's memorial was proposed , it was difficult for many people to separate their feelings about the Wall and the war from the need to recognize women . A number of women 's groups kept a certain distance ; many believed another statue would further diminish the impact of the Wall and add to the glorification of war . But many other people who supported the men 's statue were simply opposed to one for women . That sexism was a major factor is all too apparent . It was Diane Carlson Evans ' idea to put a statue of a woman at the site , and in 1983 she began working with sculptor Rodger Brodin , an ex-Marine whom she had met at a veterans ' conference . Together they fashioned " the Lady , " a three-foot-tall statuette of a nurse holding her helmet , staring into the distance . The Vietnam Veterans Memorial site 's rules state that the area is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the military women in Vietnam had been nurses , so too was the Lady . She became a symbol for the Vietnam Women 's Memorial Project , which Evans founded in 1984 . Evans and other women veterans carried her to shopping malls , state fairs , churches , and Rotary Club meetings . In her wake came an outpouring of letters and donations from former nurses , male vets , and families who had lost sons in the war . The goal of the project was to have the Lady funded , approved , and dedicated in two years , just like the men 's statue had been . By 1986 the project had support from grass-roots organizations and from Congress , which did not dare oppose the group in an election year . But the Hart statue had been added despite protests by the Wall 's founders and its designer , Maya Lin , who believed that it should stand alone . Subsequently a law was passed requiring that all future memorials be approved by three federal commissions . When the project came before the Commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commission not only vetoed the design , but it declared , " There would never be an addition to the Vietnam Memorial . " Evans , determined to have equal recognition , refused to give up . The project opened an office in Washington and hired Diana Hellinger , a former NOW Legal Defense Fund staffer , as executive director . Evans , whose children were still under the age of ten , spent two to three weeks a month on the road . Both she and the statue came under attack : Time magazine referred to it as the " intruding nurse . " The Indianapolis News stated that adding a women 's statue to the wall would be like adding Elvis to Mount Rushmore or painting the Statue of Liberty Day-Glo pink . A Missouri newspaper said Evans was a radical feminist using the Vietnam war dead to further her own cause . Despite the opposition the project forged ahead . A bill introduced in the Senate authorizing a women 's memorial at the site was passed in 1988 and signed by President Bush the following year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition . Bureaucrats along the way tried to push for a plaque or a park bench and flowers . But Evans remained adamant that women needed to be represented by a traditional statue . " We needed to have women 's physical , emotional , and spiritual presence at that site , " she says . " We wanted people to know what we looked like , what we wore , what we felt , what we did . For history 's sake . " In the winning design , by Santa Fe-based sculptor Glenna Goodacre , three women create a triangle : one sitting on sandbags , holding a wounded soldier in her arms ; one standing , looking over the Wall for incoming helicopters ; one kneeling with her head down and her hands empty . Originally this woman was supposed to hold a Vietnamese baby . The project supported the idea . But since only U.S. military men and women can be honored at the site , and the memorials are not supposed to make a political statement , the woman 's hands are empty . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every woman who was in Vietnam will find herself somewhere in the statue . It arrived in Washington after making a whistle-stop tour of 21 cities . Its dedication will be marked by a three-day celebration along with a march and round-the-clock counseling for women " coming home " for the first time . Having finally achieved what she set out to do ten long years ago , Diane Carlson Evans says : " Someone told me once , ' You will lose your sleep , you will lose your friends . But you will win justice  --  for your daughters . ' That 's what it 's all about . It 's not just for the women of the Vietnam era . It 's for our daughters .
