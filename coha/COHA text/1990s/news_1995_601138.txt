<p> You shop for groceries at midnight , like Seattle dentist Karen Sakuma . <p> You do the wash before dawn like San Francisco 's Larry Van Craeynest , so there 's enough time to catch the 5 : 20 a.m. bus to work . <p> You do aerobics at 4 : 45 a.m. , like Atlanta 's Betty Mayfield , then handle chores and childcare all day and serve your spouse dinner at nine . <p> One expert dubs you " The Overworked American , " who each year is working the equivalent of one month more than 20 years ago . <p> Another expert insists you 've actually gained free time , but you squander it on TV or infect it with the angst from your faster-paced , less-secure job . <p> You do n't really have time to keep reading this article - but you 'll scan it , hoping that maybe there 's a clue to finding a slower-paced existence . <p> You 're the 1-in-10 who has no free time , or the 4-in-10 who say they constantly feel rushed . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some career momentum to buy more family time . <p> That 's because you live in what may be the fastest-ticking , most time-conflicted era in history  --  where threats to job security mean you dare not work any less , but yearnings to " get a life " make you loathe to work any more . <p> However wearily , this nation still lives  --  or thinks it should  --  by the Puritan work ethic : Somehow , it 's not The American Way to complain about an excess of work , only about a lack of it . <p> Yet it still is deemed the height of ingenuity to extract the max from each 24-hour day  --  setting sales records for restaurants because there 's no time to cook , running errands in the middle of the night at supermarkets and print shops , being slaves to datebooks . <p> Says time management instructor June Johnson : " If I stop to look at a sunset , can I do that ? Do I have it in my calendar ? " ' <p> Shoulds ' fill leisure time From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redefinition of leisure , " says demographer Jim Spring . Instead of using free time for relaxation or recreation , people pack it with what Spring calls " ' shoulds '  --  I should fix up the house , do baking , run errands . . . . We 're managing our free time like we manage our work time . " <p> And for the most part , when people can pull that off , they 're sapped , but self-impressed . <p> " Every once in a while , I think I 've bitten off more than I can chew  --  but I have to have a certain level of stress in order to feel productive , " admits Susan Earley , 30 , a self-described " slightly hyperactive " Chicagoan who pulls 45 hours a week at her computer job , 20 hours on volunteer work , 10 hours putting a new kitchen on the house , plus unspecified time " cleaning , vacuuming , shopping " and trying to get pregnant . <p> When workers do grouse about too heavy a load , it may be surreptitiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to grab ; or in quarrelsome tones with a spouse who feels equally short of temper and time . <p> They may see themselves in Harvard economist Juliet Schor 's portrait of " The Overworked American " : wage slaves who pick up more work hours every year , both at the bosses ' behest and to feed their own consumer appetites . <p> Consequently , they lose time for hobbies or housework or sleep , and bristle with stress-related ills . <p> But then again , they may guiltily suspect they belong with sociologist John Robinson 's research subjects : workers who in fact have gained leisure hours , but still keep a sloppier house , skip worthwhile pursuits and squander spare time on TV . <p> Schor says work hours are up . Robinson says they 're down . The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics  --  whose data Schor and Robinson cite  --  says work hours held roughly steady since 1960 . <p> " The answer , " Robinson says , " depends on how you ask the question . " <p> It would take far more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the different methods , data and theories behind these conflicting tallies . <p> But on one thing all sides concur : " There is no denying the fact that many Americans are caught in a real time crunch , " Robinson says . <p> The crunch draws disproportionate attention now because it particularly afflicts two influential groups : dual-earner families , who Schor says now work 1,000 more hours each year than they did 25 years ago ; and baby boomers in general . <p> Brookings Institution analyst Gary Burtless sees " an astonishing increase in the demands " on " prime-aged people , roughly ages 24-60 , " especially in dual-earner families . <p> " They have higher incomes than comparable families did back in the 1950s , but their time is really tight . The question they have to decide is , ' Do I want to work less but have less money ? ' It is a painful choice .

" In some studies we 've done , as many as 38% of people say they ' always feel rushed ' "  --  compared to just 25% who said that in 1965 . <p> " I knew I had to work but I never thought I was going to be by myself , " says Rosa Picon , 38 , a single mother . Though she works 50-hour weeks at a Chicago health club , she insists , " The work is nothing ; raising a child by yourself is hard . " <p> Given corporate restructuring , layoffs and downsizing , " Work may have become a more nervous type of activity , " Robinson says . <p> " Ten years ago , " says Thaddeus Mayfield , 40 , " I knew that I had a few things that I needed to take care of  --  my family , my job and what little I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since my job causes me to change directions a lot , I 'm never quite in a comfortable track , " says the AT &T; marketing rep in Atlanta . <p>  --  Fully half the labor force now lives in dual-earner families , says a 1993 National Study of the Changing Workforce by the Families and Work Institute . And almost half have responsibilities for caring for dependents , either children or elders . <p> That means " Women now have to juggle both homemaking duties and the responsibility of a paid job ; and men , who should be available to pick up the slack at home , are still feeling the pinch of very demanding work , " says Kathleen Gerson , author of two books on balancing family and work . <p>  --  The organization of the workplace has n't changed , even though society has undergone a revolution , says Gerson , a New York University sociologist . <p> " The workplace by and large is still organized around the assumption of a male breadwinner and a woman at home , " she says .

" <p>  --  Sometimes weightier workloads come from the need for bigger paychecks to satisfy bigger consumer appetites . <p> Many box themselves into what Schor calls the " insidious cycle of ' work-and-spend .

" <p> In a 1994 Health magazine survey , 1 in 3 of those surveyed said they 'd trade a 20% income cut for fewer hours .
