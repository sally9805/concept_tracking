A bioethicist warns that fertility specialists are letting technology outrun good sense Photograph " With reproductive technology , " says George Annas , " you have to be responsible . " // Nkem Chukwu was crushed early last year when she miscarried triplets . Eager for children , she began a round of fertility treatments , receiving injections of gonadotropins , which stimulate a woman 's ovaries to produce eggs . Warned that she was carrying multiple embryos , which might pose health dangers for the babies , Chukwu , 29 , of Houston , and her husband , Iyke Louis Udobi , 42 , chose not to have any of the fetuses removed . Though one of her eight premature babies died last month , the others appear healthy so far , and Nkem does not regret her decision . ZI was so thankful to God , " she said , " because that was what I prayed for . " Chukwu is not alone in her prayers . As women delay pregnancy until their 30s and 40s , fertility treatments have become increasingly common . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's odds of having a multiple birth from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in S. The resulting costs are usually far beyond parents ' means , begging the question of who really pays the bills . The Chukwus ' insurance will cover some of the roughly $2 million it will take to see their babies through neonatal intensive care . But will insurers begin to pass along such expenses in the form of higher premiums for everyone ? An even more disturbing side effect of multiple births is the possible toll on the babies themselves . " When technology starts creating severely handicapped kids , something is wrong , " says bioethicist George J. Annas noting that severely premature babies are far more likely to suffer serious complications than ordinary infants . A graduate of both Harvard Law School and the Harvard School of Public Health , Annas , 53 , teaches law and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health . Married , a father of two and the author of 12 books in his fields , he spoke recently with special correspondent Michael Haederle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How common is it for women to seek treatment for infertility ? Very , and becoming more so . Twenty years ago infertility was considered private , almost shameful . Now it 's a $2 billion-a-year industry , with more than 350 fertility clinics around the country . Photograph Kelsey Ann , the smallest McCaughey septuplet , weighed a relatively hefty 2 lbs . 5 ozs. , bigger than the Chukwus ' largest , 1-lb. 10-oz. son Jioke. // What techniques are used to treat infertility ? In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , which came to the U.S. in the 1980s after being pioneered in England , is the one most clinics specialize in . It 's a procedure in which eggs-either a donor 's or the woman 's own-are fertilized outside the body , then implanted in the uterus . The cost of conceiving a baby using IVF is estimated at $60,000 , which most health plans do n't cover . Also , the average success rate is around 20-25 percent , which means most couples undergoing IVF will not get a baby . Because women in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , you now see ads in college newspapers seeking young women willing to sell their eggs for $2,000 to $5,000 . The older treatment of chemically hyperstimulating ovaries to release eggs , as the Chukwus did , is even more likely to result in multiple births because you ca n't control how many eggs are released . What are the dangers of multiple births ? The main danger is prematurity and all the problems it can cause , especially if the child is delivered before 28 weeks : mental retardation , deafness or cerebral palsy . Should there be a limit on the number of cultivated IVF embryos ? The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends three . Some doctors still implant more than three because it increases the odds that one pregnancy will take . And couples who are paying $10,000 per cycle , which is typical , may well go that route . Today there 's no regulation in this area . Zero .

At present , the ethics of the fertility industry focus exclusively on the interests of the couple who want to conceive . But the baby has to be considered here too . What responsibility does the medical community have to children who are born ? What other ethical problems arise in fertility treatment ? Once you decide how many IVF embryos you implant , what about the embryos that are not used ? Most doctors now freeze them in case the couple wants to try for another pregnancy later . It 's been estimated that there are 100,000 frozen embryos in the U.S. , and we do n't know what to do with them . What about fetal reduction , the process that eliminates the extra fetuses ? The last thing any prospective parents want to do is terminate some of their fetuses . But if their goal is to have healthy babies , sometimes you have to do it . Is fetal reduction the same as abortion ? Abortion is done to terminate a pregnancy , fetal reduction to produce healthy children . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be explored before treatment . IVF couples who balk at a three-embryo maximum and couples who want infertility drugs but are opposed to reduction should both be ineligible for treatment . Should such decisions be left up to patients and their doctors ? Because of the commercial nature of the enterprise , I think there should be national regulation for the whole fertility industry . Society has an interest in children born through reproductive technology . England licenses fertility clinics . So does Canada . We 're the only country that has a market in human eggs , permits payment to surrogate mothers and lets the private market dictate what 's done . But what about advances in the medical care of extremely premature babies ? At present , most doctors do everything they can to ensure a baby 's survival , regardless of how handicapped it might be . Neonatal intensive care has gotten incredibly good , but that 's not always a blessing . Very young babies may live , but be severely impaired . How does being part of a multiple birth affect the quality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most basic level , it 's impossible for a mother to breast-feed all her babies , which is important for their health and development . And what about something as simple as nurturing , holding and stimulating young babies ? It 's impossible for parents to take care of these kids by themselves . With the McCaugheys , they have dozens of people providing care . Short of legislation , what more can doctors do to prevent high-risk multiple births ? The key is to put the interests of the children first . Physicians have to take every reasonable step to prevent bad outcomes of their own making . The more we treat this area of medicine as a simple consumer good and children the product , the worse off the children become . What we should want to do is to give these kids a real shot at a healthy life . <p>
