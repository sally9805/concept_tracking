This space is usually reserved for the publisher of TIME , but on occasion I take the liberty of borrowing it . This is one such occasion . I 'm very pleased to introduce our new publisher , Elizabeth P. Valk . She succeeds Robert L. Miller , who will be moving to California as president of Time Publishing Ventures , parent organization of the Time Inc. magazines that are not based in New York City . <P> The relationship between TIME 's publisher and managing editor is very special . They are equals , with the publisher being responsible for the magazine 's financial well-being and the M.E. for its editorial content and quality . We usually refer to this division , in which neither lightly intrudes on the other 's responsibilities , as " church and state . " The separation is anything but a source of divisiveness . Instead , it serves as proof that good fences make good neighbors , enabling publisher and managing editor to work as partners toward common goals . That mutual trust is one of the pillars of the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for TIME as the magazine faces the challenges of journalism in the ' 90s . <P> Lisa Valk , 41 , knows TIME well . This will be her third tour with the magazine ; as she said the other day , " It 's almost like coming home . " A native of Winston-Salem , N.C. , she studied political science at Virginia 's Hollins College , where she proudly serves as a trustee . After working as a hospital administrator in Boston , she enrolled at Harvard 's Graduate School of Business Administration and in 1979 joined TIME 's circulation staff . Six years later , after stints with two of our sister magazines , FORTUNE and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , she returned to TIME as circulation director , where she helped ensure that TIME maintained the number of subscribers that it guaranteed to advertisers . On the strength of her strong performance in that job , Valk was named publisher of LIFE in 1986 and then of PEOPLE in 1988 . She is the first executive to have served as publisher of three Time Inc. magazines . <P> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his four years at TIME he brought intelligence and vigor to the magazine 's worldwide activities , demanding the best of us all . I 'm delighted to have Lisa as my new partner .
