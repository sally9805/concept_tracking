<p> THE OLD family cemetery , a half-mile from the nearest road , is marked by a rude fence . The Ellwood plantation house is empty and only the farmer who plants and harvests the corn near the burial ground regularly sees the lone stone marker . <p> " Arm of Stonewall Jackson , May 3 , 1863 , " is the inscription . <p> Seeing that monument was an unexpected treat as I traced the last days of the Confederate general 's life , and the funeral that followed . He was shot by friendly fire during the Battle of Chancellorsville  --  which he was winning  --  and his left arm had to be amputated in a field hospital . He died a few days later at the home of some friends and was taken to Lexington , Va. , for burial . <p> My inspiration for this adventure was the biography " Stonewall Jackson , " by master historian James I. Robertson Jr. , an intimate study of Thomas Jonathan Jackson from his childhood as an orphan to his dramatic death as a military hero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which left the South without the man who was known as a terror to the Union armies and made his wife a young widow , I wanted to see the places for myself . <p> Fortunately , all the important sites have been preserved or marked . However , historians are forever refining the research of others and , although there are two memorials to mark the spot where Jackson was shot , there is new information suggesting they are in the wrong place . <p> No one is arguing about the place where the arm is buried , however . <p> Touching the polished face of the memorial and looking out at the corn-stubbled fields , I visualized Jackson 's personal chaplain , the Rev. Beverly Tucker Lacy , gathering up the bloody arm from outside the surgeon 's tent and then galloping to his family 's estate of Ellwood about a mile away . The Battle of Chancellorsville was still rolling as his horse kicked up dust on the winding driveway . <p> Even as the battle swirled around the plantation house with the pillared front porch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marking the place . <p> At the National Park Service visitor center at Chancellorsville , which seemed the best place to start this tour , ranger Kelly O'Grady cheerfully pointed out the two large markers behind the center . <p> " That 's supposed to be the spot where he was shot , " he said . " However , we now know that he was shot right out front there , by the parking lot . The Park Service came close to putting the building on top of it or paving it over . " <p> This , he assured me , was new information . A Park Service historian who specializes in Jackson studies , Robert K. Krick , " had lost a lot of sleep over this one , " <p> O'Grady said . He also told me about the arm memorial , which is on Park Service land but not yet open to the public . Under the counter he keeps a map ; visitors , he said , need to get permission to go there . <p> Jackson did n't have long to recuperate after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distance from the visitor center , according to a roadside marker . The continuing battle threatened to overrun the field hospital , and Jackson was sent by his doctors on a rough , rocky , day-long trip to Fairfield , the Chandler family estate , part of the tiny community of Guinea Station . <p> Today , it takes less than an hour to cover the same distance . Amazingly , the small frame building where Jackson was taken still stands and is furnished as it was when he died . Owned by the National Park Service , it is open only on weekends during the winter . I was there on a Friday but could still peek in the window of the back room where Jackson spent his last few days . It was raining , as it was on May 10 when Stonewall died , according to Robertson . <p> His wife , Anna , sang his favorite hymns at his request . Then his infant daughter , Julia , was brought in . <p> " A bright smile illuminated Jackson 's face at the sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet one ! " he exclaimed . " The baby cooed in response . Jackson lifted his splintered hand and gently caressed Julia 's head while purring , ' Little comforter , little comforter . ' Then , Anna noted , he " closed his eyes as if committing her to God . ' " <p> I reread this chapter sitting in my car , the rain streaming down the windshield and tears down my cheeks . <p> The plan for the rest of this trip  --  a night tour of Richmond and a leisurely drive to Lexington  --  had to be discarded . My traveling companion , Ruby the Rottweiler , got sick . We drove back to Washington , where a veterinarian assured me she was fine . She probably had motion sickness . <p> I spent that night at home and set off again the next day , without Ruby . <p> A combination of the short winter days and having to double back to Washington meant I had to skip Richmond , where Jackson lay in state , and Lynchburg , where a service was held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate mood , I hummed along with tapes of Civil War marches and hymns of the period . <p> Lexington is a delightful town with enough historical attractions to fill a weekend by itself . The first stop was the town 's visitor center , where I met Naomi Smith . <p> A 12-year veteran of fielding the same questions on a daily basis , Smith was heroically patient with me . Yes , she said , Jackson 's church still stands and his memorial is nearby . " The Presbyterian church is closed to the public , " she said . " It 's rather sad , but they are open only for Sunday services . " <p> Then , like O'Grady , she offered an additional treat . She showed me how to find the site where a packet boat carrying Jackson 's body had docked on the Maury River , once called the James , and where Virginia Military Institute cadets had waited to honor their former professor . <p> I found the remains of a stone bridge abutment along the narrow river with its muddy banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a block from a major road , the setting was serene . <p> From there , Jackson 's remains were taken to his old classroom , where cadets took turn standing honor guard at the head and foot of the coffin . On Friday , May 15 , 1863 , the cadets escorted the casket to the Lexington Presbyterian Church . <p> Surprised to find the front door unlocked , I was delighted to walk into the elegant and austere church , knowing Jackson had done the same thing many times . It was here where he gained confidence as a speaker when asked to lead a prayer group and where he taught classes for local slaves . <p> His hour-long funeral service was followed by a final procession of cadets , soldiers , honorary pallbearers , government officials , friends and family who made their way to the nearby cemetery . Today the tall iron gates stand open for visitors and all paths lead to a statue of the general looking toward the south , leaning slightly on a sword with his left arm , clutching binoculars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Jackson was actually laid to rest . " Gen. Thos . J. Jackson " is all that is written on a simple marble scroll . <p> Another stone , added later , reads : " The remains of Stonewall Jackson have been removed from this spot and now repose under the monument in this cemetery erected to his memory by his loving country men . " <p> Amen . <p> WAYS &; MEANS <p> THE ROUTE : I took I-95 south from the Beltway to Route 3 west to see the area known as the the Battle of Chancellorsville and nearby Battle of the Wilderness , as well as the monument to Jackson 's arm ; I returned to I-95 and drove south to Route 606 east to the Chandler estate in Guinea Station , Va . <p> The next day , I wanted to depart from the modern-day malls , fast-food stops and suburban development as soon as possible , so on the trip back down from Washington on I-95 , I got off on I-295 north of Richmond , and then took I-64 west to Route 670 south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a beautiful , country road that winds through small towns with names like Dixie and Georges Tavern . Hunters breakfast announcements and church dinner signs beckoned at several places . At U.S. 29 , I turned south to Route 60 west and followed that into Lexington . <p> WHERE TO EAT/STAY : For help finding food and shelter in the rural area along Route 6 , call the Albemarle County Visitor Center ( includes Charlottesville ) at 804-977-1783 or 804-293-6789 ( http : **25;331;TOOLONG ) , or the Nelson County Department of Tourism at 1-800-282-8223 . <p> Lexington , and surrounding Rockbridge County , offer a wider selection of lodging , including bed-and-breakfasts in historic homes . Call the Lexington Visitors Center at 540-463-3777 . I 've visited the town several times and have yet to find a restaurant to recommend . I decided to get a hamburger at the Southern Inn , an old-fashioned restaurant on Main Street , where coffee and the burger cost $ 7.95.
