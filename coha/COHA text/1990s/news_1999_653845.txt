<p> Over a decade ago , Michael R. Daley was touring a plant that burned old tires for energy when he learned that it paid haulers to cart away gypsum , one of its byproducts . Mr. Daley was astounded : Gypsum , he knew , is used in plaster , toothpaste , paints , even molds for false teeth . So Mr. Daley set up shop near the plant to collect and resell the gypsum . <p> Since then , his company , Triad Energy Resources Inc. , has grown into a successful small enterprise , all by setting up next to corporations and finding uses for their wastes . Triad makes soil additives from the C &; H Sugar Company 's sugar-filtration byproducts in Crockett , Calif . It turns leftover skins and seeds from Australian wineries and fruit processors into fertilizer and compost . And it is now contracting with fish processors in Oregon to turn their detritus into fertilizer and fish food . <p> " If companies were smart , they 'd all locate near sources of waste , " Mr. Daley said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More and more companies are buying their neighbors ' wastes or selling their own . And a growing number of economic development agencies and private developers are building " eco-industrial parks "  --  eco-parks for short  --  for this purpose . <p> Some are doing it to attract jobs , others to reduce trash flows , still others simply to make money . But all are working on the principle that one company 's waste can be its neighbor 's raw material . And they are taking advantage of the fact that many wastes that can not be recycled back to their original uses can still be profitably used as materials for other products . <p> " A park that makes environmental and economic sense is an idea whose time has come , " said Dustin Bielagus , a developer who is building an eco-park in Londonderry , N.H. <p> Eco-parks are rising in Mississippi and Mexico . They are on the drawing boards in Puerto Rico and Mesa del Sol , N.M . The Dow Chemical Company is building one near its plants in eastern Germany . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians is looking for companies to set up at its trash-to-energy plant near Palm Springs to extract materials from the trash before it is burned . <p> While the environmental movement spawned the idea of such industrial symbiosis , it is no longer the primary force . " People realize that where materials are thrown out , there is money to be made , " said Kevin Taylor , coordinator of the California Materials Exchange Program , a state group that brought Triad and C &; H together . <p> There is money to be saved as well , added Reid Lifset , who edits the Journal of Industrial Ecology . " Companies are always looking for cheaper ways to procure raw materials , " he said , " and the more they hear about eco-industrial parks , the more light bulbs go off . " <p> The idea of selling and buying wastes is not new , of course . The Environmental Protection Agency lists about 40 government-subsidized waste exchanges . But now more entrepreneurs are becoming involved , charging companies for listing available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be consigned to subsidized exchanges whose funding can get cut , " said William Sloan , who just started Millennium Exchange Ltd. , a for-profit , Web-based waste exchange . <p> Even the terminology reflects the private-sector thrust , said Julie Rhodes , executive director of the Reuse Development Organization , a clearinghouse for information about re-using materials . <p> " People call them materials exchanges now , not waste exchanges , " she said . " The whole idea is to think of waste as having value . " <p> Still , most existing exchanges ignore location when they match waste sources with users . Factor in the cost of shipping waste , and the economics of selling it becomes shaky . But put companies next to one another , and the economics works . <p> " It 's a lot cheaper to transport used lumber from next door than it is to truck wood down from a forest , " said Ann Schneider , director of recycling programs at the University of California at Santa Cruz . <p> That is the type of argument that the Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is using to woo companies to set up near the trash-to-energy plant it wants to install in Rio Pedras , near San Juan , P.R . Patrick F. Mahoney , president of Energy Answers , said he was close to persuading a paper company to reopen an abandoned plant on the site because it could recycle waste paper coming in and use cheap energy from the trash being burned . He said he was also talking to steel and concrete companies about using scrap steel from the trash and the fly ash that is left after combustion . <p> " We can put the companies close enough to get the materials by conveyor belt , " Mr. Mahoney said . <p> Despite the proselytizing , eco-parks are not an easy sell . When a company is picking a site , a chance to lower disposal or materials costs pales next to considerations like availability of workers , taxes and nearness to customers . The sheer logistics of figuring out the proper mix can be daunting . <p> " We thought we could handpick a perfect assortment of businesses that would move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " said Michael Krause , executive director of the Green Institute , a nonprofit developer that just abandoned the idea of using guaranteed waste exchange as a draw for an industrial center it is building in Minneapolis . <p> And even if the companies come , who is to guarantee that none will move or change their products or go belly up ? <p> " The minute one company changes its processes , the whole industrial ecosystem gets screwed up , " said Stuart L. Hart , a professor of strategic management at the University of North Carolina 's Kenan-Flagler Business School . <p> Not even environmentalists are unequivocal in their support . Nancy B. Hirshberg , director of natural resources at Stonyfield Farm Inc. , fought to make waste exchange a requirement of the park that Mr. Bielagus is building next to Stonyfield 's yogurt plant in Londonderry . But she is having second thoughts . <p> " Creating a market for wastes could create a disincentive to eliminate them , " Ms. Hirshberg said . <p> Indeed , Mr. Bielagus acknowledges that his ideal tenant would generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of AES Enterprise , a company that operates power plants and will anchor the park , says the park 's green premise has not stopped local residents from yelling , " Not in my back yard . " <p> All told , the numerous ifs and buts have created a Catch 22 : developers do not want to invest millions in setting up an eco-park until they have successful models to follow , yet such models will not dot the landscape until a few more pioneers take the plunge . <p> " It wo n't be a major trend until people see more good examples , " said Nabil Nasr , director of the National Center for Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery at the Rochester Institute of Technology . <p> An example of sorts does exist in Kalundborg , Denmark , where companies have been using the principle for more than 20 years . But Kalundborg was not built for that purpose ; it had a lucky confluence of companies that started to use one another 's wastes after environmental regulations banned their disposal methods . <p> " Kalundborg was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell University 's Work and Environment Initiative . <p> That accident may , in fact , have been replicated in Tampico , Mexico . Some 25 companies , all within a 40-mile radius , recently hired the Bechtel Corporation 's consulting arm to identify their wastes . Bechtel found 44 waste streams , and one chemical plant is already using a pigment plant 's waste ferric chloride as a water purifier , while a manufacturer of industrial gases is exploring ways to use carbon dioxide that is going up a smokestack . <p> " They are looking first to see what they can exchange among themselves , and then for what kinds of companies they will woo , " said Paul Worhach , a Bechtel senior engineer . <p> Companies and developers in less industrialized areas do not have that luxury . So they are plunging feet first into courtship . <p> The Mississippi Economic and Community Development Department recently wooed a power plant to its new Red Hills Ecoplex in Choctaw County  --  in the heart of lignite coal mining territory  --  in part by pointing out the availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start operating for two years , yet Robert T. Smira , the agency 's deputy director , said he was close to leasing space to a brick maker that would use the clay left over from coal mining . The mining company , which normally uses the clay to fill in the holes its strip mines leave , will instead use the fly ash the power plant spews out . More fly ash will go for building roads , replacing the gravel that Choctaw now pays to haul in . And Mr. Smira is also trying to interest a wallboard maker in the fly ash . <p> That takes care of the solid stuff . Steady streams of water , at various temperatures , flow in and out of power plants , too . The eco-plex will have a greenhouse , a fish farm and a few food processors , all either feeding water to the plant or taking it . The greenhouse and a dry ice company will probably use the carbon dioxide from the plant 's stacks . <p> That kind of **25;397;TOOLONG setup attracted the AES power plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap water . Heated water coming out of the power plant will be piped first to other factories that can extract some of the heat , then back to the treatment plant . AES also expects to sell steam it would otherwise vent to the air . <p> In theory , it is an unbeatable system  --  but no one knows how many manufacturers will respond . Other eco-park developers feel more comfortable casting a wider net for tenants , then offering incentives for them to use one another 's wastes . <p> The Sustainable Technology Park Authority , a nonprofit organization , is building an eco-park in Cape Charles , Va. , that welcomes any tenant that promises to operate along strict environmental rules . As tenants move in , it will use lists of their byproducts to woo others . But now it simply offers rent reductions to companies that exchange wastes . <p> " We are n't setting up the whole park around that , " said Timothy E. Hayes , the agency 's executive director .
