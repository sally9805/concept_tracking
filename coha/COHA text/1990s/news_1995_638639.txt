<p> For decades , only friends and family paid attention to speed-skating competitions , which mostly took place in roller-skating rinks , with skaters competing on quads - traditional roller skates . <p> Then , three years ago , the U.S. Amateur Confederation of Roller Skating allowed its members to use in-line skates , and to compete in new outdoor races . All at once , corporate sponsors were tripping over each other to offer the best skaters cash , gear , airplane tickets to races , commercial spots and prizes . ESPN-2 broadcast skating competitions that previously did n't make even the local news . <p> USAC skaters accustomed to training and competing in obscurity were dazzled by the sudden limelight . They were astonished when businesses offered them free gear - wheels , clothing , skates - and paid for competition entry fees , and even travel expenses to lure the top-ranked skaters to races across the country . <p> " None of us could believe it , " says Heather Lacayo , a top-ranked skater for the Geo/Rollerblade team . " We were used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids skating . It was like the difference between the Bolder Boulder and a high school cross-country meet . " <p> At the outdoor skating races , whose sponsors included Rollerblade , Pepsi-Cola and later the International Inline Skating Association , skaters got the kind of attention they usually saw only when they competed internationally . The athletes loved it - the fresh-air road races , the sponsors , the freebies , the media coverage and more . But USAC , the sport 's governing body , seemed to have reservations about the changes , and thereby hangs this tale . <p> " I do n't think , back then , that USAC thought in-line would go anywhere , " says Pam Schwier , an Orlando , Fla. , rink owner who coaches 300 hockey players , 72 speed skaters and 40 artistic skaters ( roller skating 's answer to figure skating ) . <p> " When in-line took off , and there was money from sponsors and more races , it worried USAC a little bit because up to then , it had been their ball game . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment from its headquarters in a Lincoln , Neb. , building that has housed it since the ' 70s , when USAC operated in partnership with a national roller-skating rink owners ' association . <p> What they saw were giddy participants . " There were thousands of people at the finish lines - strangers , not some skaters ' parents ! " says Lacayo , who earned her living for the first time skating in 1992 and 1993 . <p> " Sponsors were paying my entry fees , giving me equipment . There was nothing like that before . Once , I went to a race in Florida , wrote a check for the airline ticket even though I did n't have any money , because I 'd heard there was a cash prize . I got there , won the race and put the money in my account to cover the airplane ticket . I was racing every single weekend , all over the country . I attribute that to being able to win a place on USAC 's world team that year . But the next year , USAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which was just about all those outdoor races . " <p> The decision bewildered and infuriated skaters who carried USAC cards - nearly everyone who took competitive skating seriously . A skater ca n't compete on the U.S. national or world team without belonging to USAC , which is the sole governing body designated by the U.S. Olympic Committee and skating 's international governing body . Not all skaters heard about the decision right away , and it cost them . <p> Julie Brandt , then age 13 , was invited to skate in a Michigan fun-roll fund-raiser for a local children 's hospital . The race was not sanctioned by USAC . Brandt won a trophy , and USAC found out . The organization sanctioned Brandt as " skating under protest " - a punishment that meant later losing the first-place medals that Brandt won at the outdoor regional and national competitions , omitting her from the 1993 record books , and putting her on two years ' probation . <p> " It was totally unfair ; I did n't know until after the fund-raiser that I was n't supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now the U.S. 's top-ranked female skater . One of four female members of the USAC world team , she 's competing in the Olympic Festival 's speed-skating competitions at Balch Field House in Boulder beginning today . <p> Other skaters , including Lacayo , Steve Carr , Jondon Trevina and Norm Kirby , skated deliberately in competitions USAC refused to sanction . They hated the new rule . <p> ' It was ridiculous ' <p> " It was horrifying , because there were ( non-USAC ) races everywhere ; I was calling race promoters , begging them to work with USAC so they 'd be sanctioned , " Lacayo says . She claims she spent a week in 1993 trying to persuade USAC to sanction an East Coast race , but that USAC waited until a few hours before the race to refuse permission . ( She raced anyway . ) <p> " I know of at least one who had so much trouble with USAC that he decided not to put on the race at all , " she says . " It was ridiculous , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that USAC , historically an indoor-skating organization , was threatened by the booming popularity of outdoor races , in-line skate sales and rumors that the IISA was interested in becoming the governing body for speed skating . <p> Current marketing reports would support their suspicions . From 1987 to 1994 , in-line skating participation increased by nearly 513 percent , while traditional skating participation declined by nearly 13 percent . ( The only individual sport that came close to that was mountain biking , with a growth of 511 percent . ) In sheer numbers , there still are more traditional skaters than in-line skaters , but the gap is closing fast - 18.8 million in-line skaters last year , compared to 21 million traditional skaters . <p> USAC defended <p> USAC 's George Pickard defends his organization 's actions . He says that USAC is only trying to look out for its members ' interests . USAC no longer forbids its members to skate in non-USAC competitions . Today , USAC requires skaters to pay a $ 10 " processing fee " for each nonsanctioned race they enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' Let 's all get together and have a big race , ' which is not the way we operate here , " Pickard says . <p> " These other entrepreneurs want to run a meet , attract our skaters to their events and collect fees from them - sometimes , $ 30 , $ 40 , $ 50 fees . <p> " We were having trouble with these entrepreneurs running competitions conflicting with our events . <p> " They have to coordinate with us . Otherwise , it 's impossible to properly structure events that will be meaningful in terms of the big picture - bringing skaters to excellence . We 're not jealous of anybody . I 'm not jealous . I 'd just like to see everybody get along and work together . " <p> Suspension letters <p> Yet Miami skater Tim Small , a former USAC champion , had problems with USAC when he tried to form his own skating organization in 1977 . <p> " When skating competition changed from wooden wheels to plastic wheels without much warning , it changed the sport so drastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amateur Roller Speed Skaters Association - and USAC did n't like it at all , " says Small . <p> " They sent letters to their coaches , saying anyone skating in my association races would be suspended or protested . They said they were the sanctioning body and that their skaters ' amateur status would be harmed if they participated in my races . Nobody understands how USAC does things like that and gets away with it . Nobody tries to challenge them . " <p> Skaters paying fee <p> Until recently , that is . InLine magazine editor-at-large Jon Lowden wrote a column critical of USAC 's 1993 policy and the $ 10 fee USAC now charges skaters who want to participate in races not sanctioned by USAC . Pickard and USAC responded by slapping Lowden with a lawsuit for libel that 's currently pending . <p> Earlier this year , USAC , the IISA , attorney Kent Correll and some skaters met with representatives of the U.S. Olympic Committee to address USAC 's controversial competition policy . <p> Disgruntled skaters hope that the USOC will revoke USAC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit charging the $ 10 fee for skating in nonsanctioned races . Until then , cautious USAC skaters keep paying the $ 10 , in case USAC decides to penalize skaters again as it did in 1993 . <p> " We 've had arguments about the fee all year , and not everyone pays it , " says world team member Derek Parra , who 'll be at the Olympic Festival competition . <p> " I pay it to stay safe , so I 'll be covered . In case . " <p> So does Tony Muse , another world team member skating at the Olympic Festival . <p> " In 1993 , I sat out quite a few races , and I probably cost myself a little bit of money from race earnings and sponsorships , just to make sure I 'd be able to skate the world championships , " Muse says . " Now , it 's not an issue any longer , or if it is , I do n't know about it . " <p> But others disagree , including coach Pam Schwier . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the option to compete in those other races , if they pay the fee , but they 're still fearful of USAC , " she says . <p> " They 're scared that USAC wo n't give them the placements they deserve at competitions , worried about sanctions being imposed on them . USAC does n't make its hockey players pay that fee - and they compete in non-USAC tournaments - but speed skaters do n't have a choice . <p> Nobody has the right to tell athletes where they can or ca n't compete . There is not an organization out there better than USAC , but that does n't mean I think USAC has all the answers . "
