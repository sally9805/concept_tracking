MacroMesh site ( for transMars and deep-ocean distribution ) , April 1 , 2099 VAGRANT TRAPPED IN DYNAGROW HOME # Section : A SCIENTIST 'S NOTEBOOK As the next millennium approaches like an overloaded ocean liner , fat with metaphor and passengers , many will attempt to peer through the veil of foggy futurism , sighting fresh continents of the mind . <p> Beyond that magical number 2000  --  for purists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current trends . Others will assume , like southern Californian weather forecasters , that tomorrow will be pretty much like today , only more crowded . <p> Alas , it can not be so . Our society is driven by high rates of technological change and exploding social ideas , so powerfully that stasis in any arena is impossible  --  indeed , inconceivable . One idea that shall surely not survive this century ( perhaps to be nostalgically recalled as the mythic TwenCen , as language compresses under cyber-pressure ) is that of the readily foreseeable future . <p> Many future thinkers , especially sf writers , are now less interested in making straightforward predictions of the future , and thus in helping determine it , precisely because they do not believe that linear , programmatic determinism is the right angle of attack . <p> Their views of that future are often playful , seeking to achieve an almost impressionistic effect , imagining small scattered details of a future that imply more than they can say . This approach allows one to seek the most vibrant metaphors while cocking a wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have come a long way from unblinking wonder at technology , distancing ourselves from the top-down social engineering doctrines that accompanied the optimism of the late- 19th and early20th centuries . <p> Virginia Postrel , author of 1998 's The Future and its Enemies , argues that the essential political differences today are between stasists and dynamists . Sf sides with futures run not by Wellsian savant technocrats but by the masses , innovating from below and running their own lives , thank you very much . <p> This gathering belief in dynamic change driven by freedom and information flow contrasts with the oddly static tone of much earlier thinking . Mundane literature has carried an unspoken agenda , assuming that the present 's preoccupations stand for eternal themes . <p> Even early sf presumed that elites should rule and that information should flow downward , enlightening the shadowed many . Sf 's Shakespeare , H. G. Wells , was welcomed to speak by the Petrograd Soviet , the Reichstag . Stalin and both Roosevelt presidents . This company never doubted their managerist agendas , and Wells had his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The genre looks to more vibrant metaphors , while cocking a wary eye at our many looming problems . <p> Sf writers are less interested in predicting and thus determining the future . They see themselves more as conceptual gardeners , planting for fruitful growth , rather than engineers designing eternal , gray social machines . <p> What does this portend for the next century ? Clearly the TwenCen has been the century of physics , just as the nineteenth was that of mechanics and chemistry . Grand physical measures still beckon . We could build a sea-level canal across Central America , explore Mars in person , use asteroidal resources to uplift the bulk of humanity . Siberia could be a fresh frontier , better run by American metaphors than the failed , top-down Russian ones . ( In fact , the U.S. is the only power that knows how to build and run a frontier . Siberia would be a natural for us . ) Our world will continue to be shaped by new physics-based technologies . <p> But that wo n't be where the main action lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more often employs the self-organizing principles popular in biology , economics , artificial intelligence , and even physics . Rather than use monolithic ideas or institutions , we seem poised to employ smaller , more interactive scales . Market competition ideas echo Darwinian evolution . Order , even wholly new species , arise from individual mutations that propagate . In such distant scientific realms as fluid turbulence , small eddies build into larger ones through competition among whorls . <p> In our own brains , somehow the firing of synapses blends into a storm of electrical signals that organize into ideas or emotions-emergent order . Many phenomena display properties that grow from below in ways science does not fathom . <p> I 've argued before that the 21st century will be the Biological Century . We will gain control of our own reproduction , cloning and altering our children . Genetic modification is surely a dynamist agenda , for the many mingled effects of changed genes defy detailed prediction . Although the converging powers of computers and biology will give us much mastery , how such forces play out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , not detailed plans . <p> Despite our impulses to control the shadowy future landscape , to know the morrow , it will be increasingly hard to do so in the years to come . <p> The most infamous attempt to predict the economic and social future was the Club of Rome 's The Limits to Growth ( 1972 ) . Based on a computer model of the interaction of various global socioeconomic trends , the work foresaw only exponential population growth and dwindling natural resources , allowing for no substitutions or innovation . A famous bet over the projected price of metals in 1990 led to the Club 's public debacle  --  copper became cheaper , not the foughtover commodity predicted . <p> Although the oil crisis of the 1970s lent the work credence , resource markets have since erased the gloomy , narrow view of how dynamic economies respond to change . ( Not that oil wo n't get precious . World production will peak around 2010 , and prices will rise steadily thereafter . Sell your SUV soon ! ) <p> Rather than looking at the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond immediate concerns , tracing longrun ideas that do not necessarily parallel the present . A historical example of this approach is the Irishborn physicist J. D. Bernal 's The World , the Flesh , and the Devil , which examined the long-term prospects of science and society in terms that seemed bizarre in 1929 but resonate strongly today : engineered human reproduction , biotechnology , and our extension into totally new environments such as the deep oceans and outer space . <p> Another , rather enjoyable way to regard the future is to listen to scientists thinking aloud in a long perspective , making ranging forays into territories seldom illuminated coherently in our era of intense narrowness . Prediction is speculation , normally frowned upon in science , and thus it often arrives well-disguised . Sometimes it is a shortterm claim to a notion awaiting exploration , as when James Watson and Francis Crick , in the last sentence of their 1953 paper reporting the discovery of DNA 's double helix , laconically noted that they saw its implications for reproduction : " It has not escaped our notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying mechanism for the genetic material . " <p> In similarly laconic British tradition is a slim tome of a stature comparable to Bemal 's , Freeman Dyson 's Imagined Worlds ( 1997 ) . In his lofty view Dyson , an English physicist , shares an advantage with science-fiction writers . Both are good at lateral thinking  --  the sideways swerve into future scenarios not justified by detail , but by their intuitive sweep . Refusing to tell us how we may get to their visions , Dyson and others take in a wider range of possibility than the hampered futurologists . As Dyson wrote : " Science is my territory , but science fiction is the landscape of my dreams . " <p> Yet another way to broaden the vista of prediction beyond the consensus is to recognize that the future will always deal us a few wild cards . An unlikely , but not impossible , fundamental discovery or development , or some strange combination  --  particularly when coupled with the vagaries of human behavior  --  can send the future veering from its expected course . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that big surprises are in store . As late as the 1950s no one , not even the most prophetic sciencefiction writers , foresaw solid-state microelectronics and the personal computer revolution that it would bring . In the 1920s and ' 30s , who anticipated that genetic resistance to those new antibiotic wonder drugs and our indiscriminate use of them would end our rosy expectations for the quick conquest of bacterial infection ? Using intuition , educated guessing , random choice-whatever means we wish  --  we can focus on some of those potential wild cards , imagining their effects on the future . In so doing , we expand into the realm of the unexpected , where the improbable may become extremely salient , and sf is a favored tool . <p> Physics Today , April 2008 QUANTUM TELEPORTATION IN THE LAB ... teams in Italy showed large-scale transport of quantum information about objects instantaneously to distant points , using entanglement , a connection between separated objects , long known as a purely theoretical feature of quantum mechanics .

The entire wave function of even large objects apparently can be " entangled " with a state that exists on the other side of a wall . The object in this case would be the woman who , as witnesses described , passed through the wall of the ultra-secure AT &T; Intel vault and made off with several thousand state-of-the-art carbon-based microchips . After emptying the vault , said Nikolas , the thief would then have had to entangle herself in another wave function outside the building in order to leave .

Within the next decade , foreseeable advances include a flowering of digital astronomy , completion of the Human Genome Project , and the sequencing of DNA from many creatures , especially ourselves . <p> Single technologies can dominate over the scale of a century , but no more , and Dyson guesses that the next century will dance to the songs of petroleum scarcity , computers and biochemistry , plus the two newcomers , genetic engineering and artificial intelligence . Combining these last two alone could give us fresh variants on humans or animals , with microchip-augmented abilities .

Onboard software will allow washers to talk to the embedded chips of the smart clothes loaded into them . When we wear these clothes , the same chips will sense temperature and send signals to the reactive fabric , which then will adjust itself to suit our personal comfort settings . <p> There is no reason why a full-blown computer will not be wearable , too , perhaps as a fanny pack with a small keyboard fitted to the wrist .

For simpler tasks a built-in " social secretary " with a small camera ( or a direct tap into the optic nerve . You could recognize that vaguely familiar person we might bump into at an office party . It could provide not only the right name but also a short biography , enabling us to ask without a pause , " Say , Fred , how 's that daughter doing at Caltech ? " <p> We often think that the future belongs to the glitzy professions . Nevertheless , manual labor also will be altered by the changes to come , including the role of the farmer . <p> New Scientist , May 2 , 2020 CAN WE BECOME QUEEN OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany rush to complete the Honeybee Genome Project , a new era is dawning in our genetic understanding of the social insects . <p> Consider a field of maize ( corn , to Americans ) . At its edge a black swarm marches in orderly , incessant columns . <p> These long lines of ants carry a kernel of corn each . Others bear bits of husk . In some places entire teams coagulate around chunks of cob . The streams split , kernel-carriers trooping off to a ceramic tower , climbing a ramp , and letting their burdens rattle down into a sunken vault . Each returns dutifully to the field . Another , thicker stream spreads into rivulets that leave their burdens of scrap at a series of neatly spaced anthills . Dun-colored domes with regularly spaced portals , for more workers . <p> These had once been leaf-cutter ants , content to slice up fodder for their own tribe . They still do , pulping the unneeded cobs , stalks , and husks , growing fungus on the pulp deep in their warrens . They are tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has genetically engineered them to harvest and sort first for the human masters , processing corn right down to the kernels . <p> Other talents can be added . For example , acacia ants naturally defend their home trees , weeding out nearby rival plants , attacking other insects that might feast on the acacias . Take that ability and splice it into the corn-harvesters , and we do not need pesticides or the drudge human labor of clearing the fields . <p> Can the acacia ants be wedded to corn ? It does not seem an immense leap . Ant species are closely interrelated and multitalented . Evolution gave them a wide , adaptable range . <p> Following chemical cues , they seem the antithesis of robotic machinery , though insects are actually tiny automatons engineered by evolution , the engine that favors fitness . Why not co-opt their ingrained programming , then , at the genetic level and harvest the mechanics ? <p> Some human farmers will be insect tenders , more like beekeepers than tillers of the soil . Others will find their livelihood threatened . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FARM-WORKER UNIONS PROTEST " STRIKE-BREAKER BUGS " Mexican Immigrants Return Home  --  " No Work Here " <p> The Achilles heel of predictions is that we have as much difficulty foreseeing the limitations of a technology as its promise . <p> A 19th-century dreamer might easily generalize from the newly invented " wireless " to envision the sending of not merely messages by radio waves but also cargoes and even people . Matter , after all , is at bottom a message , since it can be turned into energy and propagated . Nevertheless , the awesome radio did not develop into a matter transmitter , which is no closer to reality than it was a century ago . <p> Undoubtedly , then , some of these analogy-dreams will not come true , particularly in their timing . It seems likely that , despite the current fashion for nanotechnology artifice on the scale of billionths of a meter , the molecular level  --  biotechnology will come first . The latter is easier to implement , because the tiny " programs " built into life forms have been written for us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , some of the more intriguing prospects for nanotechnological applications derive from our knowledge of the characteristics of biological materials . For example , one of the basic mysteries in biology is how the linear chemical structure of a protein molecule specifies the way that it will wrap itself into a unique three-dimensional shape , which in turn determines its biological function . <p> Tekno-Squint Mag , September 2035 ... came as essentially a surprise to molecular biologists when the protein-folding problem was solved last year in a series of elegant experiments in microgravity aboard the International Space Station . The scientific community was at first skeptical of the concept that proteins , like growing plants shoots , somehow sense the Earth 's downward pull and orient themselves accordingly . With general acceptance of the idea , however , came a quick and simple algorithm for predicting the spatial configuration of any protein from its amino-acid sequence ... <p> An obvious long-chain molecule to fold and use as a construction material is DNA , which , given the appropriate molecular machinery , can make more copies of itself . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic . By adding bells and whistles at the molecular level , through processes of DNA alteration , we could then make intricately malleable substances , capable of withstanding a lot of wear and able to grow more of itself when needed . <p> It is not fundamentally absurd to consider sidestepping the entire manufacturing process for even bulky , ordinary objects , like houses . We have always grown trees , cut them into pieces , and then put the boards back together to make our homes . Someday we may grow rooms intact , right from the root , customized down to the doorsills and window sizes . Choose our rooms , plant carefully , add water and step back . To do fix-ups , simply paint the house with a solution that feeds the self-repairing functions . <p> Believe It !

The truly revolutionary force in modern times has been science , far more so than the usual " radical " politics . <p> Birth control pills changed social relations far more than edicts from the state . Cars and the Interact enhanced the flow of people and information that institutions as varied as corporations and police sought to control . <p> Nevertheless , many of the above examples underline the implications of leaving genetic choices to individuals . Society has some voice in defining boundaries , but typically we arrive at consensus only slowly , while biotechnology speeds ahead . Perhaps we are poised at the start of a profound alteration in the essential doctrine of modem liberal democratic ideology . There may be genetic paths we will choose to block .
