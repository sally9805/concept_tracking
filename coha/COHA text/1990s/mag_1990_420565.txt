Section : CAPITOL IDEAS <p> As I write , the probability of war in the Middle East looks very high . Perhaps , in time-honored fashion , Saddam Hussein will be deposed by his own junior officers . But at this juncture it is difficult to visualize either side climbing down . What if we do go to war with Iraq ? In the opinion of the more hawkish element among conservatives , such a war can be easily and swiftly won , so great is our technological advantage and so superior the training of our military . This may well be true . If by victory we mean simply the destruction of Iraq 's military machine and its nuclear and chemical plants , victory can probably be easily achieved . <p> What is less clear is the way things will look on the day after the bombing raids . Richard Perle of the American Enterprise Institute , formerly an assistant secretary of defense , argues against those who worry that a US. attack on Iraq " would forever alienate the Arab world . " To the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more likely to despise us for failing to destroy Saddam Hussein 's military power . " Perhaps it all depends on how you define the Arab world . If the phrase refers merely to heads of state , then Perle probably has a point . We do enjoy the support of a number of Arab rulers , some of them no less ruthless than Saddam Hussein himself ; one or two of them would love to see their rival Hussein destroyed . <p> To what extent the " Arab street " would rejoice at the bombing of Baghdad is another matter , of course . My own suspicion is that the festivities in Damascus and Cairo would last for no more than a few hours before the Arab world began to see the U.S. as rather more intrusive and threatening to its interests than Saddam Hussein ever was . But , as I say , war does look likely , so maybe we will have a chance to see who 's right here . ( A look at my earlier columns shows that I have been wrong in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing pointless arms control agreements , thereby signaling " weakness " to Gorbachev . Amiability worked , it now seems . ) <p> On September 17 , the Air Force chief of staff , General Michael J. Dugan , was fired for speaking out on the record about the probable course of U.S. military action against Iraq : " The cutting edge would be in downtown Baghdad , " and so on . By all accounts , Gen. Dugan was fired for candor , not for making up his own policy . Of particular interest was the following comment , reported by the Washington Post . Having identified three " culturally very important " sites in Iraq  --  possibly religious centers  --  that American bombers would avoid , Dugan added : " We 're not mad at the Iraqi people , and when this is all over we do n't want the Iraqi people to be mad at us and the rest of the allies we 've brought together . " <p> Are Americans naive or what ? Comment in recent weeks really has been tinged with the suggestion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " international community " ( that 's us , folks ) for punishing the aggressor , restoring the legitimate emir , and upholding the Wilsonian principles of stability , order , and the sanctity of national borders . Warning to American conservatives : they wo n't feel any such gratitude  --  even if we display cultural sensitivity and leave two or three of their more highly valued mosques unscathed . Sure , King Fahd of Saudi Arabia will heave a sigh of relief . And Hafez el Assad of Syria will be grateful if we finish off his enemy and rival . Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , having thrown in his lot with the Western powers , will , at least for a short time ' feel reassured that he joined the winning side . But Mubarak is in power courtesy of the Egyptian army . How will the Egyptian people feel about bombing raids in Iraq ? <p> The serene confidence of some conservatives has been nowhere more strikingly on display than in a series of Wall Street Journal editorials in August . Following a " short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be a need for the permanent reform of Iraq 's government , with the installation of " a new , moderate leadership " there . After the removal of Hussein , steps should be taken to ensure that " there are no further crises of this type in the Persian Gulf . " ( How is such a grandiose goal to be achieved ? ) <p> To be sure , this will require " a permanent force of some power in the region . " Which can be arranged : " Long after our troops come home , and we all hope it 's soon , " President Bush told Congress in September , " there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the nations of the Persian Gulf . . . " The newspaper seemed to be having second thoughts when it later suggested : " Iraq could be put under the suzerainty of an Arab leader the West and Iraqis trust . " But the next day brought the following apercu : " If we take Baghdad and install a MacArthur regency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor ones . The usual foot-dragging has been detected on the other side of the Atlantic , where " messy things like wars are beneath the dignity of Europeans . " On the plus side , though , Syria " will want to reconsider its position " as the player of hostage games , and Iran 's Rafsanjani " will have a new reason to press for a rapprochement with the West . " <p> I cut my ideological teeth on Wall Street Journal editorials , but I have to dissent from these hawkish views . The paper has long been an admirer of the carrot , but has lately emerged as even more respectful of the stick . Who knows , maybe time will prove them right . Maybe , by the time you read this , Iraq will have been pacified , the new MacArthur will be on his way to the smoldering ruins of Baghdad , and Iranians will be down on their knees , not worshipping Allah but quaking before the newly resolute Americans . But the ink was hardly dry on the Journals comment about Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapprochement  --  with Iraq . <p> As for Syria , Assad has already been adopted as our latest ally and regional counterweight , and was swiftly awarded " non-megalomaniac " status by Anthony Lewis of the New York Times . No doubt Assad will be treated as deferentially by the State Department as was Saddam Hussein until the day before he invaded Kuwait . How can one have any confidence in a foreign policy bedeviled by such incurable activism ? The perennial U.S. search for " stability " abroad resembles nothing so much as an out-of-control 18-wheeler roaring down the highway , slamming into hapless motorists and careening off first one guard rail and then the other . Secretary of State Baker strikes me as an empty figure , one week strutting about from one international conference to another , the next lying low as his policies come under scrutiny . <p> Foreign policy seems to be based on an inordinate attachment to the old European idea of the balance of power . A decade ago we discovered , no doubt with an abundance of CIA reports and satellite photography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of Persian Jerry Falwell , the Ayatollah Khomeini . Reliable reports filtered back to Washington that he opposed the separation of church and state  --  possibly had not even heard of the idea , or of Thomas Jefferson either . Frightening ! Obviously , he had to be stopped at all costs  --  before he spread his fanaticism through the region . Aid , subsidies , technological assistance , and Export-Import Bank credits flowed to our new regional counterweight , Saddam Hussein , who was granted " nonfanatic " status . He had his faults , but at least he was n't a fundamentalist . He used comfortable socialist rhetoric and dressed in secular attire : our friend the Ayatollah-stopper . <p> U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie dropped in for deferential visits : " We have no opinion on the Arab  --  Arab conflicts , like your border disagreement with Kuwait .... We have many Americans who would like to see the price go above $25 because they come from oil-producing states . " As late as July 27 the administration was pressuring Congress not to oppose a $500 million food-aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake to " micromanage " foreign policy . <p> A week later Hussein invaded Kuwait and became , almost overnight a megalomaniac Kurd-gassing oil-reserve-controlling Baghdad-bullying media-manipulating chemical-weaponhoarding nuclear-we apon  --  seeking . . . monster ! Suddenly , there was this very important cause we were expected to go to war for : Regional Stability . Lest we had forgotten about our " shared responsibilities , " Maggie Thatcher came across the Atlantic to remind the President . And now we have made ourselves a new friend in the region , Hafez Assad .... How will he look next year ? Do n't ask . Right now we have to " isolate " the Butcher of Baghdad . <p> How can we have any confidence in politicians and policies that veer so erratically , shifting from alliance to enmity as unpredictably as children choosing sides in a schoolyard ? Why ca n't we just stay home ? Because of oil , we are told . Our vital interest , wrote the hawkish Karen Elliott House , is " the free flow of oil at tolerable prices . " On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Henderson ( also writing in the Wall Street Journal ) , and the columnists Warren Brookes and Doug Bandow , who point out that Hussein posed little threat to the oil supply . He was certainly planning to sell the oil that we are now preventing from reaching the market . <p> Well , we are told , we ca n't just give up on the " international responsibilities " that Mrs. T mentioned . Ca n't we ? I have more confidence in the vision of America that President Reagan liked to use , the " shining city on a hill " : America should influence the world by example , not by force . " George Bush 's great good fortune , " the thoughtful neoconservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote four months ago , " is that he is a man utterly incapable of vision at a time when people do not want vision and do not need it . " Unfortunately , having been earlier derided for lacking it , the President got vision with a vengeance . It turned out to be a U.N . vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was enunciated with such gusto . Clearly he believed every word of it : " A new world that is struggling to be born , a world quite different from the one that we 've known , " and so on . But if the U.S. , now unrestrained by the Soviets , charges ahead in pursuit of this U.N . goal of " international stability " which is to say , U.S. taxpayers coming to the rescue of beleaguered foreign governments  --  it will be a disaster . This is liberal internationalism run amok . <p> Governments do tend to be beleaguered , because the great problem with the world today , as throughout most of this century , is leviathan government . All over the world , in the vast majority of countries , the citizenry is oppressed by predatory government , which is everywhere staffed to the bursting point by the educated classes . They have found out that it 's possible to live very comfortably off the labor of their fellow men by invoking the rhetoric of either compassion or external threat . The U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives live comfortable tax-free lives in New York ) which has pledged to come to the rescue of beleaguered governments . This is called " international stability . " What is needed in many of these countries is not stability but revolution . " A little rebellion now and then is a good thing , " as Thomas Jefferson said . <p> Nowhere is the oppressive hand of predatory government more keenly felt than in the countries of the Arab world . For decades , almost all of them have been under the thumb of one or another tyrant . ( The Kuwait regime was , it 's true , one of the less oppressive . ) Socialism has been tried and found impoverishing . The touted oil wealth has done little more than create welfare and enrich an indolent ruling elite who hire outsiders to do the real work . <p> Without the institutions that make the West productive  --  the rule of law , the freedom of contract , relatively secure private property rights  --  anything more than family-sized industry is difficult to achieve in the Arab world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . One is not supposed to say this , but since the end of the colonial period , during which the Middle East benefited , if inadvertently , from Western institutions , there has been a vast , unacknowledged material decline in the Arab world , in comparison to the West . For that reason , it may well be possible for us to carry out the " surgical strikes " pressed by the military . <p> But most Arabs have been at the mercy of their own tyrants and can not be blamed for their own subjugation . Nor do they feel inferior to the pornand drug-infested West . In consequence , they feel a rising sense of grievance and despair . Hence , I believe , the rise of Islam  --  a religion that appeals to people with little to lose . How will they feel if we bomb Baghdad ? Will they rejoice because we taught the aggressor Hussein a lesson and restored the " legitimate government of Kuwait " ? No . There will be great hatred of the West , and of the U.S. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Bethell is The American Spectator 's Washington correspondent <p> <p>
