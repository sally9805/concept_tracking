<p> In coming months , one out of every four movies you see likely will be made by or paid for by a Japanese company . <p> MCA Inc. , which made E.T . - The Extra Terrestrial and Born on the Fourth of July , is the latest entertainment giant to yield to Japanese money . Chairman Lew Wasserman sold the company this week for $ 6.6 billion to Matsushita Electric Co. , which makes Panasonic , Quasar and Technics televisions , VCRs and stereos . Last year , Sony Corp . bought Columbia Pictures . And last month , Walt Disney arranged for Japanese investors to finance all of its films during half of next year and most of 1992 . <p> You might ask , so what ? When the lights go down and you dig into your popcorn , will you even notice ? Probably not . But the acquisition - Japan 's largest here - raises hackles and arguments over continued Japanese investment in the USA . <p> " There would be an act of Congress before Disney is taken over by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company analyst at Bateman Eichler , Hill Richards . <p> Japan 's recent buying binge - from real estate " trophy " properties , factories to golf courses and now movie companies - is being quenched by its deep , deep pockets . Awash in cash , Japan can buy almost anything it wants . That leaves people wondering : Is everything from sea to shining sea up for sale ? Will Japan end up buying it all ? <p> " The answer is , yes and yes , " says former U.S. trade negotiator Clyde Prestowitz . <p> Most people in Hollywood are just glad to see the cash , even if some criticize them for selling out to the Japanese . <p> " That 's really ... racism . You would n't be wringing your hands if it were a British company that were buying , or a French company or a Dutch company , " says David Geffen , the music producer who , as the largest shareholder in MCA Inc. stands to pocket $ 660 million on the deal . " I have no concern about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they look like . I 'm concerned about how smart they are . " <p> They could be very , very smart . By buying into Hollywood , Sony and Matsushita ( pronounced " mat-SOOSH-tuh " ) are both fighting to become the world 's leading purveyors of entertainment " software " - movies , TV programs and records - as well as entertainment " hardware " - the TVs , VCRs and sound systems - to play them on . <p> Owning Hollywood studios also could help Matsushita push a cutting-edge technology called high-definition television ( HDTV ) . The entertainment industry , so far , has balked at a technology that will require new equipment from the sound stage to the living room . Now , Sony and Matsushita could produce their own movies using HDTV production standards and sell them directly to the public on video . If you want to watch , you 'll have to buy an HDTV set - primarily from Sony and Matsushita . The two electronic powerhouses arguably will be able to force U.S. broadcast networks , like NBC and CBS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That could give them the added size and scope to take on the goliaths of the U.S. electronics industry . <p> " I do n't care if they own E.T. , " says Prestowitz . " The bigger question is : Will they own IBM ? " <p> Just this month , MGM-UA Communication Co. was purchased by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti 's Pathe Communications for $ 1.3 billion . No one raised an eyebrow . And Australia-based News Corp . swallowed 20th Century Fox in 1985 . Overall , the British own far more of the USA than Japan does . But Japan 's rapid ascent as a major investor here - from No. 5 to No. 2 in under 10 years - and its long-running trade dispute with the USA - make U.S. citizens particularly sensitive when a piece of the economic fabric changes hands . <p> " Some economists say , ' OK , we lost autos , we lost steel , we lost electronics , but what American talents are really good at is software - computer software or entertainment software , like creative pursuits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be leaders in that area , " says Daniel Burstein , author of Yen ! , which criticizes Japan 's growing influence in the USA . <p> Matsushita is n't likely to make big changes at a company that 's already successful . The jobs and investment - everything but the profits - will stay in the USA . " It makes little difference to America whether MCA is owned by a Japanese company or by a Swedish company or by an American company , as long as the home base stays in America , " says Michael Porter , author of The Competitive Advantage of Nations . <p> What 's more , Japanese investment in U.S. firms returns money that 's flowed out of the USA . " We 're buying a lot from the Japanese : cars , stereos , consumer electronics . Dollars flow over there , " says economist Wayne Gantt . " They 've got to do something with them . So they come in , they buy Treasury notes , they buy buildings , they buy entertainment companies . " <p> The real problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms , but that U.S. companies ca n't afford to . <p> " We have to ask , ' Why is it that our economy is not producing the investment capital for companies to buy a very attractive entertainment and leisure industry ? No one here has that kind of money , " says Burstein . <p> U.S. companies also do n't have the long-term vision of Japanese firms , says Porter . Almost any U.S. firm that amassed $ 6 billion in cash would either be promptly taken over or be forced to distribute it to shareholders . And Matsushita 's far-reaching strategy - a hardware maker buying a software firm - might mystify U.S. investors . " That kind of a story does n't sell very well in our capital markets , " says Porter . <p> The deal comes at a time when many people thought the Japanese were back- pedaling on their U.S. shopping spree . Japan 's economy , like ours , has been smacked by the Iraqi crisis and a sluggish stock market . But Hiroshi Hirabayashi , economic minister at the Japanese embassy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary . <p> " Very soon , the Japanese economic slump will be bottoming out ... and Japan will be recovering confidence in its ability to expand domestically and internationally . " <p> That line of thinking implies that even more eye-raising Japanese mega- deals might lie ahead . And some economists argue that we should welcome the Japanese . <p> " Given the fact that they 've got all those U.S. dollars , I 'd much rather have them turn around and be invested back in the U.S. than in Germany or Japan itself , " says economist Murray Weidenbaum , former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers . <p> More than one economist draws parallels between Japanese investment in the USA today and U.S. investment in Europe after World War II . " There was a lot of American investment in Germany ( in the 1960s ) , and look at how well they 're doing , " says Porter . Japan 's gain is not necessarily a U.S. loss , he says . " This is not a zero sum game . " <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 118,351 Japan 72,514 Netherlands 60,242 Canada 31,829 Germany 28,429 Source : Commerce Department
