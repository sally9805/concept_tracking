$ Dollars and Sense Teaching kids about cash Last fall , Julia O'Hara decided it was time to invest her $400 savings in the stock market . She was just shy of her 12th birthday . After her dad , a corporate investor in Toronto , realigned his jaw , he gave Julia the nod  --  as long as she followed his rules . Now , under dad 's tutelage , Julia has begun the first step in investing : researching and tracking the stocks that interest her , from Irwin Toys to Spar Aerospace , before actually spending any money . " She 's learning , " says Julia 's mother , Peggy . " She can read the stock pages and knows that the business section of the newspaper is not a scary place . " That learning process is what kids and cash are all about . While not all youngsters will have an interest in high finance by the time they turn 12 , they will all appreciate the autonomy that money gives them . And within a few years , they 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Family , half of all Canadian teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 hold down part - time jobs and earn , on average , $3,300 a year . That 's a whopping $2 billion in annual buying power . As parents , we can help them use that power wisely , and maybe even save a little for the future , by starting when they are still tots to unravel the mysteries of money . Most of us are doing that anyway , albeit unwittingly . Our children learn by example , explains Chris Snyder , president of ECC Group , a Toronto personal finance firm , and author of How to Teach Your Children about Money . " So it behooves parents to set good values and management methods  --  to be good role models . " That can be as simple as consciously including your children in the price comparisons you do during shopping expeditions , or explaining ( as Julia 's parents did when she was five ) why you peruse the stock pages every morning . Parents can also capitalize on the educational aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finessed her math skills , fundamental to money management , playing cribbage and Yahtzee . Snyder recommends such classic board games as Careers , Monopoly and Stock Ticker . Above all , says Russ Fleming , a specialist in elementary education with the University of Toronto 's Faculty of Education , " have faith that very young children can learn these skills . " Much like Julia is doing with her dummy portfolio , children can learn to itemize their earnings and needs , analyze them , make choices based on that information and , then , live with the consequences . Here are some tips from parents and financial experts on what children need to know about managing money and when they are ready to learn it . To Age Five Once children have stopped putting money in their mouths , put it in their hands . As early as age three , kids take an interest in the pictures on coins and will soon be able to learn their relative value . The Canadian Bankers Association suggests introducing simple games  --  for example , counting the number of pennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let your child " earn " money by counting out the 50 pennies needed to make a roll and trading the rolls for quarters at the bank . Then graduate to trading four quarters for a loonie , and two loonies for a toonie . You can encourage little ones to save some of their riches in a piggy bank but remember that they also need to spend it , if only to learn that a nickel , despite its size , buys less than a dime . Elaine Douglas , president of the Financial Fitness Group in Vancouver , remembers her surprise when her four - year - old grandson pulled two dollars from his pocket to pay for their treat during an outing to Granville Market . " I mentioned it to my son and he said , " He 's got to learn to pay his way and to know that things cost money . ' I thought that made a lot of sense . " It does , especially because , even at this age , the " gimmes " engendered by TV commercials have begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance . Then , by letting him determine which candy or toy offers the best value for the money , and explaining that mommy and daddy must make these judgements every day , you can introduce that unfortunate financial fundamental : Money does n't grow on trees . Ages 6 to 9 By the time kids are in school , they 'll have some understanding of the cost of those things they see advertised on TV . This may be the time to formalize the weekly allowance . Some parents suggest linking the stipend to household chores , figuring this teaches children the worth of work . Ellen Roseman does n't buy that . In her recent book Money Guide for Modern Families , she explains that children " should not have to be paid for behaviour that is a normal part of co - operative living .... Allowances are to be paid unconditionally to children whether they " deserve " it or not . The money is given in an attempt to teach youngsters about spending and saving . It 's not a bribe or a punishment . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer your child the chance to earn extra money by , say , washing the car or dusting the books . However you set up your system , Snyder stresses that kids must be part of the negotiations to determine what they 'll do with their cash and how much they need to meet those expenses . It 's important to give enough of an allowance to make spending worthwhile , perhaps 50 cents or a dollar to start and an additional 50 cents or dollar at every birthday . You and your child may determine that that 's enough to pay for candy or comic books , for instance , but she 'll need more if she is expected to cover the cost of a movie or Nintendo rental . Then , once you 've established the parameters , butt out . London , Ontario dad Stephen Foerster says that the weekly allowance he hands over to his four children " is totally their discretionary money . " Only then , he says , do they have the freedom to choose their purchases and to develop a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make mistakes , adds Snyder , " tons of them . But better at a young age than when they get older . " Others recommend building some saving savvy into allowance negotiations . Roseman suggests children divvy their funds into portions with attainable goals attached : a percentage to long - term savings ( for a special excursion or , as they get older , for college or university ) , another to short - term savings ( to buy a coveted toy , perhaps ) and the rest for spending . Some parents may want to add a fourth pot , for charitable donations . Make saving easier by giving the allowance in small change so that it can be " deposited " into the appropriate stash without fuss . Retire the preschooler 's piggy bank in favour of see - through jars that let youngsters watch their funds accumulate and keep the loot accessible so that they can count it often . To keep savings on track , try taping a picture of your child 's goal to the jar . And to encourage regular contributions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions dollar for dollar . That 's how Saskatoon dad Gary Hersche helped his daughter Alison buy a bike a couple of years ago . " Actually , she wanted to pay for it all herself , " says Hersche . " She wanted the ownership . " But Hersche figured that by successfully saving , Alison had learned some valuable lessons already and deserved to be rewarded . Eight year - old Alison did n't argue . Once kids have accumulated some savings , they 'll likely want to open their own bank account . Not only does an account allay the temptation to dip into savings , it also gives you the opportunity to explain deposits , withdrawals and , eventually , interest and cheques . The major banks have programs geared to young savers and some will even give older children their own automatic banking card  --  a plus when it comes to helping kids understand the vagaries of those mysterious money - dispensing machines . Alison , for example , was perturbed when she used the cash machine to withdraw her $60 contribution for her bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " laughs Hersche . " So when the automatic teller gave her three $20s , she said , " This ca n't be my money . I did n't have any $20s . ' ' " Parents , too , reap the rewards of their children 's good money habits . Hersche says it 's especially gratifying when his three children offer to help out with family treats . " Every once in a while , they 'll want to order in pizza for dinner . When we say we ca n't afford it , they offer to buy from their allowance savings . They take great pride in being able to do that . " And the bonus is that once they feel that pride , they 'll want to earn more money  --  by selling lemonade , holding yard sales or doing extra chores around the house . When my daughter was six , for example , she was happy to top up her allowance by vacuuming all the carpets for an additional 50 cents . Ages 10 to 12 As your child grows , so will his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many kids are doing jobs outside the home  --  delivering papers , cutting grass or babysitting . As their income increases , so should their savings . Since their sense of time and their math skills are more developed , you may want to help them move their savings out of the bank and into more lucrative vehicles . You can explain how investments such as GICs or Canada Savings Bonds offer secure alternatives . ( If you do n't understand the subject yourself , consult an expert  --  some financial advisers run investment clubs or courses for preteens . ) But keep in mind , says Fred Smith , national president of the Canadian Association of Financial Planners , that even at this age , " investing is still a training rather than a money - making venture . " When it comes to spending , however , these kids are well past the training stage . If your child has been covering some personal expenses from his allowance , he 'll already be up on budgeting basics . That will come in handy when his desires jump from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can expand your child 's budgeting know - how by giving him responsibility for more of his own expenditures  --  entertainment expenses , for example , or a portion of his clothing . At the same time , consider changing his allowance to a biweekly or monthly schedule . In addition , you might also begin sharing some of your family 's financial information . Snyder suggests doing this by letting your pecuniary prodigy help handle your bank deposits and write the cheques for household expenses . Just remember to balance your chequebook with a little levity . After all , finances should not be feared . Ultimately the art of money management should be fun and enjoyable ... for kids , at least !

In his book How to Teach Your Children about Money , Chris Snyder makes several suggestions , including the following for school - aged children : Have a treasure hunt . Kids search the house for loose change and keep any combination of coins they can tally to a dollar . Collect currency from your trips outside Canada and compare its value to Canadian coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trading stickers or baseball cards to promote the art of bartering . Include your children in price comparisons . In the grocery store , line up different brands of one product and ask the kids to find similarities and differences . Explain why you choose the way you do . Or , compare prices for a bicycle at different shops and ask the dealer why his is higher or lower . If you buy products advertised on TV , let your child judge whether they live up to the claims made about them . Preteens can take on a few more challenges : Look for old money in coin shops or museums . Compare the face value with the current value of these old notes and coins , and talk about the difference inflation has made . Visit a part of town where people are less for tunate than you are . Help your kids figure out how and why the houses and buildings look different . Find out if there are examples of the government using tax money to help people there . Start some " what if " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed to make a profit ? What if everyone had the same income ? " Talk about what your kids would do if they won a lottery , including the best ways to spend , give away , save or invest a lot of money . Compare the plans of various family members . If you have a collectible heirloom  --  a piece of furniture or a painting , perhaps  --  see whether your child can research its history and find out why it is valuable .
