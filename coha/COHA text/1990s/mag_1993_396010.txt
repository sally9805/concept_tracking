THE EXPENSE OF SPIRIT " At last , the distinguished thing . "  --  Henry James 's final words Oh , did I mention that John Singer Sargent painted my great-aunt ? No ?  --  Yes , Muriel . What led to the portrait ? A streetcar accident . What led to the streetcar ? Her Professor father 's appetite for cowboy novels written by Karl May . May ( 1842-1912 ) was a German high-school teacher nabbed for petty theft . In prison he taught himself to write . His narrow cell 's subject ? Galloping Indians of the Great Plains , palominos , buttes . He saw America only after writing sixty books about it . And yet , to this dreamer con man I owe my American citizenship , my lack of a trust fund , and , I suppose , the Sargent portrait . My great-grandfather , Professor Donald Fraser of the University of Glasgow , was tenured , landed , married , surrounded by four adored if never-quite-beautiful daughters . A gardener pruned his vista . Three intelligent maids re-alphabetized his library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the sixteenth-century stone house , big and old enough to warrant a name  --  " Sunnyside , " naturally . ( Oh , to have a dollar for every lost homeplace once called " Sunnyside . " ) Fraser was forty-five , boasted a lustrous white beard that seemed a dividend on his distinction . He 'd published four books , two about Robert Bums and one concerning lotus imagery in world literature . ( All this is true , I swear to God . ) His most personal work , The Bagpipe , Some Reminiscences , chronicled his own collection of ancient nearly museum-worthy pipes . But local happiness was not enough . No , his venturing spirit led him to those cheap , gallant , faintly autoerotic Westerns by a German jailbird jewel thief . And the Professor believed those tales . Then he learned of a teacher exchange program . And without really consulting his family , Donald Fraser chose to transport them all to the University of Chicago for a year . He thought Chicago was The West . Turns out it was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just lived ; it 's also wished , is n't it ? Maybe Art is history most livingly wished . Oh , to break in now and shout back to him , ambered in the 1870s , " Great-grandpoppa , stay home . Perfect Sunnyside 's rock garden . Marry off your smart daughters to the smug and titled local gentry . Save to buy Mackintosh furniture . Get fat . But do n't read trashy books for boys . Great art always offers troubling adult portraiture . Bad art offers easy lies and makes for bad decisions . Stay . Stay there . " But I ca n't . And he could n't , and if he had n't , Singer Sargent would n't enter into it , and you might not be interested . Professor Fraser , his ladies , and their nineteen trunks ( packed with one year 's art supplies for the daughters ) arrived , unheralded , in the mythic Chicago of the 1870s . The town had a cowboy novel 's mules and dust . After rain , it became a Venice made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead-white ankles , loitered under gas streetlamps in even the best neighborhoods . Civil War veterans , their blue uniforms emptied of legs and arms , begged , aggressive , on street corners . No building looked more than six months old . To the stately Professor 's four virgin daughters , workmen muttered personal ghastly things . Stockyards brought the scent of reality into the most elevated thought . Everything seemed omen . One afternoon , to cheer five womenfolk , Donald Fraser squired them toward high tea at what , one heard , was the best hotel . It featured Chicago 's first revolving door . But a crowd stood pressing noses to the portal 's fanning glass . One clever brown hen had escaped a passing farm cart . She then dashed toward safety but chose a door like an upright threshing machine made of mirror . Professor Fraser could see the chicken in there , still alive and flapping against tile floor , her head twisted beneath the rotating black rubber flange , her red wattle seeped out from underneath like black rubber 's own red rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotsman told his eldest girl and confidante , who looked . Nobody could push the door without killing the bird . Her free wing beat so , trying to lift the ten-story building nesting on her spine . The crowd of city swells in fur , velvet , and cashmere seemed unconcerned about one chicken 's life . But everyone acted embarrassed that a single country fowl could block entry to so fine an establishment , and at teatime . Muriel , having peeked , her face a stark white vertical beneath its tweed bonnet , now tried to hold cupped hands over three younger sisters ' eyes . " It 's a hurt one , " she explained . " If you see it , you 'll remember , so , do n't ... please . " The youngests peeked ; crying resulted . Muriel already understood : this sight had entered her forever ; a hen was lodged there in that door and the sight was in her now . The family soon discovered : that homesickness meant just that  --  sickness , a stubborn flu of longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp could send any of them unto nausea itself . The girls did sketches of Sunnyside 's apple orchard . Muriel , the astute eldest , Papa 's favorite , portrayed Sunnyside 's foyer . She showed its William Morris laurel wallpaper backing forty frames of Piranesi 's classical ruins . She even added the yellow ceramic umbrella stand , crammed with hawthorne walking sticks and houseguests ' orphaned umbrellas . Her drawing made the container seem so avuncular a jumble that , according to Papa , it looked the very portrait of Mr. Holmes 's squat companionable sidekick , Dr. Watson . " I see that , " Muriel nodded , smiling . The visiting Professor taught classes in an accent his students joked about ; they asked for repetitions . Two months before the Frasers ' planned return to Glasgow , the whole family began packing . Overpreparing , Fraser brogues thickened to butterscotch density . The day before departure arrived , the Professor 's wife  --  pretty , plump  --  hurried to Marshall Field 's , buying gifts for Scottish relatives , tablecloths and matching napkins . Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block from the store when a streetcar jumped its tracks . It came at her . It was striking her . It had pinned her underneath it . Already , her pelvis had been crushed like some Sevres teacup trod upon by boots . Kind treatment she received on the street was later attributed to eleven scattered bundles in Field 's giftwrapping . Those , if not her dreadful screams , had marked her as a lady . Four doctors , overpaid , the best by all accounts , told Donald Fraser , " Scotland ? Any travel would be fatal . She would die on the train to New York . " The accident had rendered the daughter of Lord Kilkairn an invalid for life . She could not walk , would have to be carried forever moaning from bed to bed . Now the Professor 's employment ended . ( The teacher he 'd traded places with came home wearing a touristic tartan vest , and amicably evicted the clan . ) Fraser 's own university was an ocean away , unable to continue his salary or tenure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodgings . Educated by live-in tutors at Sunnyside , the man was skilled in Greek and Latin . To quote all the poetry he had by heart would take him three days . He could draw serviceably , could sing in a decent tenor the popular Italian arias ; his bagpipe collection was considered somewhat comprehensive . He 'd known Rossetti , had entertained Ruskin . He had shared a childhood mathematics coach with that other gifted charming nomad susceptible to boys ' literature : Robert Louis Stevenson . But not one of Fraser 's **28;60;TOOLONG warranted five dollars of ready Chicago cash . Stranded here , Professor Fraser sought a permanent job at the university , but he 'd been a guest , a novelty . He ran a newspaper ad , the cheapest four-word minimum : " Can Tutor , Most Subjects . " With the house exchange over , shelter for a family of six must be paid out of pocket by a man who 'd never known the heartache of rent . Now the Frasers ' American home stood between a busy firehouse and a busier liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraser began contributing articles to a local sporting paper . As his waggish tragic pen name , he chose " Raffles . " The Racing News complained he too often mentioned lotuses , Greek gods . Donald Fraser considered taking in a lodger . He tried the public schools , but his Scottish credentials were not respected here . Soon the word " Professor , " written before his name , seemed as dubious as the " Doctor " he saw scribbled on calling cards tacked to doors in the dark halls of the latest boardinghouse . He was forced to telegraph a land agent in Glasgow . He sold Sunnyside via mail , his furniture , his library , everything at a loss . His wife 's bills were terrible and he , so eager to get the poor woman home ( mistaking this for Cure itself ) , consulted doctors who made promises they could not keep . Instead , they gave her drugs she came to need too much , even as the prices rose . Four daughters performed their usual Friday musicales on a rental Chickering upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small if overdecorated parlor , maroon hangings flanked the mantel ; pennants showed peacocks ( male to the right , female left ) worked in metal threads , placed there , in part , to hide the plaster 's cracks . The Sisters Fraser attended crowded slumside public schools . A head-lice epidemic made even their curls suspect . Their mama had been the forceful utilitarian , humoring Papa 's whims , standing guard over his writing hours . Whenever he acted swaggering or impractical , she had smiled at their daughters , saying as he listened , " Spare wee Donald his illusions , girls . They 're our only real capital . " But now  --  without her help  --  how loud and under-rehearsed poor Papa sounded . The girls soon lied to protect him ; school was fun ; this flat was " cozy " ; America was friendly . Mrs. Fraser needed attending round-the-clock ; her bedside table seemed an opium den 's as she reverted to baby talk , lived banked in pillows , gained weight , looked pale and round in her daytime nightdress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sang to her . If left alone even a minute , she cried . Mabel , the youngest , chanted to herself , " All the king 's horses and all the king 's men could not put poor Mama back together again . " But Mrs. Fraser  --  second daughter to Lord Kilkairn  --  would live , a victim of stupefying good health , for another thirty-five years . One evening while his wife slept her laudanum sleep , the Professor called his daughters from their narrow rooms , walls pasted with photogravures , inspirational poems , and their own accomplished sketches . Into the hands of Muriel , Ethel , Jenny , Mabel , he placed gold coins , $200 apiece . " Hide these , " he said . " It 's what we 'll have from our selling the dear homeplace . Your mother will never travel again . This must be your dowry . No matter what awaits us on ahead , I will never ask you for it . And if I somehow do , you 're never to surrender it , ye hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houseguest John Ruskin , " ' The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to SEE something , and tell what it SAW in a plain way . Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think , but thousands can think for one who can see . To see clearly is poetry , prophecy , and religion  --  all in one . ' Girls , continually SEE yourselves . Know you were born to be more ... than mere Americans . " As the sisters , arms laced around one another , sat watching , Papa overwound his pocket watch while reciting Bobby Burns in roiling Gaelic . It was a language the daughters had already most cleanly forgot . Weeping , the gentleman feigned a coughing fit , then rushed out for a walk along a great lake he pretended , late at night , to be the surging River Clyde . The more fuddled Professor Fraser became , the louder did he praise his eldest girl as " the son I never had . " To Muriel he ceded household accounts once kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame ; he told every fact learned belatedly about the imprisoned author of those Westerns that 'd tricked him into sacrificing his wife and virgin daughters to some idea of an American future . " One assumes a writer knows whereof he speaks , that he 's traveled farther than some atlas copied in a jail cell , " Donald Fraser complained about Karl May 's deception . But the more gossip he collected concerning the writer 's woes ( May had been blinded from birth to age five by nothing worse than malnutrition ) the more allied he felt with a fellow victim . Untenured , Donald Fraser  --  alias " Raffles " of The Racing News  --  could only envy May 's speed , his caliber of well-paying pulp . Within three years he had sent all his girls into the world to earn their keep ; for him , this tragedy outweighed the accident itself . To fare badly in Scotland was unseemly if melancholic , familiar ; but " Perfesser " Fraser , as they called him here , soon understood that in America , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no blighting word as wicked as plain " failure . " It rendered you and yours prairie Untouchables . One girl would become an executive secretary , one a private tutor in French , and , saddest , the youngest and fairest found work wearing a starched mobcap and frilled apron selling Belgian chocolates in a lovely little mirrored shop on Michigan Avenue . Muriel , the talented eldest , a child prodigy performer in Glasgow some years back , now taught the children of the rich to play piano presentably . Before the accident , she had entertained at afternoon parties for Mrs. Armour , who then hired her to train the little Armours . The heiress lectured Muriel that she must always use the mansion 's side entrance marked with a bronze plaque , DELIVERIES AND STAFF . Miss Fraser arrived wearing a black dress ; the garment itself required costly benzine cleaning , but its detachable white lace cuffs and collar could be laundered daily and at home . Muriel understood from the start that a cheap black dress looks better longer than a cheap blue dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's own dependable fruitwood metronome , the difficult Czerny lessons annotated with her decisive script , an apple as her usual lunch , and slip-on gold ballet slippers to make pedal instruction easier . Mrs. Armour liked her children to take their lessons while she held large teas for small women in distant rooms . She liked the sound of cultural betterment . She once sent Muriel a note , via the butler 's gold tray , " S'il vous plait ? Fewer scales , more melody pour mes cheres amies ? " When Muriel herself played a little Bach two-part invention , she heard the company ooh-aah . Muriel guessed the heiress must 've claimed credit for her child ; our heroine could not resist sliding into a passage from Pergolesi , one of great difficulty , and the ooh-aahs soon muted to silence . Mrs. Armour , the famous auburn-tressed beauty , had been Miss Sophy Brophy , a novelty dancer in the Varieties . She now insisted on being called " So-phie ' ' -a . " Her pretension was legendary , as was her cruelty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever drag your scuffed carpet " clutch " right into our Venetian Room ? " Muriel 's Roman nose was perhaps too bold , her Norman chin a bit too shy , but her black suit and knowing smile troubled even Mrs. Armour . Maybe it was above some massive Bosendorfer grand , maybe in just such a lakefront palace , perhaps while listening to an eight-year-old millionaire bed wetter punish the keyboard up and down then down and up , maybe there Muriel saw her first Sargent . She discovered another fine example at the new Art Institute . Miss Muriel Fraser , a chaste girl , nineteen , then , suddenly and unfairly , twenty-seven , now somehow thirty-eight years old , Muriel  --  in her fitch fur collar and matching muff dyed to seem mink  --  studied one of Mr. Sargent 's early improvements on a local meat-packing heiress . In the picture , Muriel found something autobiographical . Not in the silly woman herself , no , but in the heiress 's hastily rendered white satin , her ropes of all-too-real pearls rendered as globules of cream-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became pearlier than any oyster 's best try . It was exactly the upgrading of reality to which Muriel , as pianist , expatriate , and practical dreamer , subscribed . If you could not be a great artist yourself , then you drew near the best one alive . is , perhaps , was as close as any uncourted piano teacher and former prodigy could come if not to love , then , at least , to honor . A close second , surely . And the Master you knew enough to choose ? He saved you , and , with you , redeemed your clan 's tarnished dignity . For how long ? Merely Forever . Muriel , being the eldest of the daughters , best remembered the stone manse full of bustled servants and amateur theatrics . She recalled the scent of blossom from the apple orchard when Papa claimed the whole seven acres were " under full sail . " One entire attic room held costumes , ancestors ' greasy periwigs , snuff-stained red-brocade frock coats . Muriel remembered shopkeepers dropping half-curtsies to Professor Fraser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the yards of canvas still so lushly painted that they seemed eternally wet , transitive , maybe Muriel first phrased the notion , " Might this not constitute a knowingness to stave off losses ? Is this not a baffle against such renters ' sadness as we now live in ? Could this not be  --  at last , the distinguished thing ? " Over the mantel of the Frasers ' railroad flat there hung a mammoth gilt-framed mirror . Of no value , it was intended to lighten a room too prosaic with its sooty air-shaft view , too sombered by crackled varnishes , too earnestly poetic with its wistful peacock hangings . Imagine the restitution performed by a Sargent of some loved one . Set in the simplest silver frame , it would replace that heavy , ugly , hopeful , empty mirror . Muriel decided : belonging to Sargent 's own moneyed set was not required . No , perhaps distinction rested more precisely in having first recognized the single major portrait artist of your own epoch ; and then simply " arranging " ( oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that term " arranging " ) to be portrayed by that very painter . His immortality was assured , and yours with it , your tradition 's with it , and his , with Art 's own . Securing such an image would mean reinstating your family into that framing proscenial reality where it so plainly belonged , from which it had so cruelly toppled . One artful image would prove to the Sophy Brophy Armours of this world that your loved ones ' single mingy tragedy had been if not averted , then transcended . It would reveal the deeper beauties stretched beyond one 's incidentally absent Physical Beauty . A Sargent portrait might tell you who you might , most favorably , have been . It would prove that your accustomed entrance remained the marble-arched , unnamed , Palladian front one  --  not the side alley 's green door under its wall-bolted bronze interdiction : DELIVERIES AND STAFF . Such a quest for portraiture , permanence , might also offer some of the rushing pleasure that accompanied absolute usefulness . Muriel most longed for use ; even the indignities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do not teach Armours . I teach Music . " All that practice , practice , practice . And then to leave behind no justifying performance ! Surely that would be a double death . And so , unusual for anyone on either side of my family , Muriel , the musical one , the practical one , gradually and then suddenly knew exactly what she wanted . Past that , she began to understand all that she must sacrifice to get it . Nothing seemed too difficult . No social slight , no skipped meal , no finery forgone could compare with having glimpsed the justifying Eternal at the center of her dignity daily betrayed . Here in exile , in an Elba called Illinois , around the single silent chance , Miss Fraser 's life soon organized itself . Maybe Muriel overheard a covey of local ladies , not quite rich enough to imagine being portrayed by Mr. Sargent , spell out a few facts concerning this well-placed American born abroad . His Boston mother inherited so much money , she forced her doctor husband to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best hotels . Mrs. Sargent , herself a clever watercolorist , took her boy John on picture-making excursions up many a hotel 's own alp . Young Singer Sargent , born a prodigy , was soon training in Paris , making teachers jealous and painting the respectable , then the notable , then the brilliant . His vigorous brushwork brought American energy to portraits of the tireder crown heads . His van Dyck technique and marble certainty gave America 's newly moneyed the suavity of pedigreed beauty they most craved . And Sargent was not just a civilized man but some new specimen of genius . Now living in England , he 'd already painted forty English lords and their ladies , had depicted Mr. Henry James ( by subscription ) . Sargent never even saw the States till he turned seventeen . And Muriel , a loyalist expatriate herself , would later admire the way he turned down a knighthood in order to remain American . After all , " Sir " John Singer Sargent had a certain destined ring to it . She learned that he 'd befriended Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she did . At the Public Library , Muriel perused ( for free ) the literary reviews in hopes of seeing some tiny oleographic copy of Sargent 's latest picture . And she commenced to save . Even after she paid Papa her board and offered her share of Mama 's growing drug expenses , even after she helped rescue her baby sister from working in the chocolate shop to stay home with Mama , Muriel still economized with an inner rigor Scots are famous for . But her daily concessions were rendered the easier by vulgarities and harshnesses around her in what Papa , ever more embittered , called The Land of the Cuspidor . To make her own apple-a-day luncheon feel a bit more Roman-noble , Muriel befriended the young fruit vendors ; she collected their proud spotty lore , becoming an expert on ideal characteristics of today 's two-cent pippin , tomorrow 's two-cent winesap . If sadness be one 's lot , then one became a connoisseur of sadness . Muriel made a cult of walking everywhere ( incidentally saving fares ) . After Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tracks , their useless bells , but no Fraser could afford the costly horse cabs . Cabs were only for emergencies and  --  everyone agreed in a show of hands at a family council  --  only for temperatures of at least fifteen below . Miss Muriel 's fine black buttoned shoes were re-re-re-repaired . Soon she no longer needed to wear the ballet slippers to teach pedal work-so sensitive a second skin did her worn soles make . In Scotland , the spoilt sisters had been invited to complain about this and that . It was a rite of refinement to find trifling fault with some of what Papa provided : a blouse rendered scratchy by zealous over-starching , the birthday cake too overtly chocolate  --  and Papa liked that , there . He called his girls " my pea-fearing prin-cesses . " But now , but here , the girls must praise everything , and Papa complained , he railed  --  some bearded bourgeois whose fortune would be returned to him one-paycheck-at-a-time by his four day-labor Cordelias . Sisters slipped the landlady rent supplements , begging that she understate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some nights , in a rare good mood , he made his usual toasts . Candlelight at table softened and enlarged the flat to almost seeming Sunnyside 's beamed dining room . In the saving half-light , he requoted mottoes said a thousand times before : " Baby Mabel , please pass the salt dish , my beauty ? As Chazal wisely tells us , " Salt is the policeman of taste ; it keeps the various flavors of a dish in order and restrains the stronger from tyrannizing over the weaker . ' ' " His girls smiled , as did Mama , propped nearby . But Fraser 's declamations seemed to mean less at this mended rental table , its two shortest legs made steadier by the dominoes Muriel had wedged underneath . Papa 's next epigram was now upstaged by a sudden fire alarm next door , or by some strangers ' marital dispute out on the landing . " Why is it no one ever listens to me here ? " And Fraser slammed his fist upon the tabletop . Salt leapt so . Muriel found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping , with terrified authority , into an empty orchestra seat just as gaslights died . Sometimes gruff latecomers banished her , in sight of two thousand observers . Once , Sophy Brophy Armour , presiding , bosomy in white , from a similarly bosomy white stage-side box , nearly witnessed such a humiliation . Happily , one elder lady usher had commenced to recognize Miss Fraser , to save her . If , in public places , young mothers half-smilingly acknowledge one another , nodding , then so do the Single sniff out and respect one another 's dignified solitude . The visibly unmarried usherette , silent , officious in uniform and pedantic in dispensing programs , soon beckoned Muriel Fraser from the " Will Wait : Standing Room " line ( cheapest of all ) . The usher then guided Muriel down front to some exquisite aisle seat , the usher creating a silent flourishing fuss that our piano teacher hated enjoying as she did . It was Miss Fraser 's particular genius to see herself exactly as she was . A mixed blessing , surely . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stranger 's eye . Though a gifted musician , she knew that those pianists taken seriously in Chicago 's music circles were all young men with massive profiles , manes of hair . These youths had foreign-sounding names often invented to improve on monikers straw-plain as Sophy Brophy 's . These boys all enjoyed society sponsorship , meaning older lady admirers , interested in a pretty fellow 's genius , or more . Muriel had received a few excellent notices for her own early concerts : " In the Brahms , we heard an emergent soulfulness that far surpasses her technique , which is already merely perfect . " But , as with her prospects for a worthy suitor , Muriel understood precisely what " someone like Miss Muriel Fraser " might , after all , expect . " Miss " came to seem both her noun and verb . It was this double vision that , oddly , marked her as the least likely person ever to desire a portrait from the world 's leading society painter . And yet that very contradiction helped fuel Muriel 's resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , say , one 's face is assigned  --  could be partly saved and sweetened by the wish , some wish , any wish enacted , a wish obeyed . Sir Osbert Sitwell called Sargent 's portraits " guardians of the Edwardian shrine . " As a boy Sitwell " sat to " Sargent ; the child whined and wandered till the painter was driven to quote distracting limericks . Sitwell wrote , " Sargent 's subjects loved him , I think , because , with all his merits , he showed them to be rich . Looking at his portraits , they finally understood how rich they really were ... " What then had Muriel to anticipate ? Might not the Master reveal her essential poverty ? Or would he hint , past the fortune lost , at some present interior wealth ? Must Miss Fraser hurt herself upon the Master 's charity , his professionalism , or his social knowingness ? Surely one 's sustaining spiritual well-being would prove harder to depict than mere white satin and real pearls . And yet Muriel felt half-ready to entrust herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was this not simple common sense ? You found the single specialist who might save you , at whatever price . Past that , was there a choice ? Art becomes your own history most livingly wished . Seeing clearly can constitute your poetry , prophecy , and religion . How sensible , plain faith in beauty . How practical , Art . Times Muriel wondered , was her Scottish lineage worth her own stark nunnish loyalty in preserving it ? She re-read Papa 's four books and knew , despite great hope , their charming limitations . Perhaps she owed her truest allegiance to the line 's more illustrious future , some chronicler to come ? Her " sort , " after all , was no more than the bourgeoisie that keeps its womenfolk engaged with fireside stitchery and punch making , its men collecting volumes of military history , supervising the yew topiaries ' progress , refortifying the garden house . Her mother 's father , though technically Lord Kilkairn , was famous , if at all , for his precocious gout , his impassioned grouse hunting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , the Prince of Wales , soon to be King Edward VII , a wag who lived far beyond the reach of any bill collection . Muriel , bundled in scarves , clutching her carpetbag , out here in a wind that cut across a thousand miles of prairie unimpeded , stood at a railroad crosswalk studying another hundred cattle cars bringing animals to slaughter , to use . The lowing beasts , breaths smoking , gaped out at her  --  as if to ask her help from History , assigned . Their cuds ' white spittle still showed chopped greenery from one last home-meadow meal . And as Muriel watched another ten thousand rattle toward their predestined date with the plates of Delmonico 's , she felt herself to be the eldest heir and protector of so forthright and distinct , so pleasant and useful a tradition . Muriel knew  --  with rank unsentimentality  --  what she herself could forevermore expect : a further succession of often lazy , always indulged students , facing the open copy of their assigned " Fur Elise " and admitting , quite insolently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while daring plain Miss Muriel Fraser to find a punishment strong enough to interest them in art while remaining mild enough to prevent her being fired . In the Armours ' kitchen , the butler paid her from a macaroon tin marked HOUSEHOLD PETTY CASH . In those days , dollars came in coins and , having her weekly salary flipped , she learned , defiant as any apple-peddling street urchin , to snag it midair with one pale expert palm . Every six weeks Miss Fraser was summoned to Mrs. Armour 's boudoir reception room . Red-haired , dressed in a spillsome Empire manner , Sophy Armour reclined upon a chaise almost Pompeian . The chamber was bone color with green piping that reminded our reserved if irreverent Muriel of one word : spearmint . Mrs. Armour made carelessly certain that the strict-looking teacher , pointedly not invited to sit , glimpsed the title of a book she held . Golden script incised " Ruskin  --  " Sesame and Lilies ' ' " on a leather binding crafted from one fetal calf who 'd made the ultimate sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junior Armours ' gathering musical skills . What were the odds against a possible concert career for one if not two of them ? The practical truth ran counter to Miss Fraser 's own best interest . And yet her standards would permit no outright lie . As Muriel recounted small if building victories in keyboard competence , she studied Sophy Armour 's Ruskin . The great man had been a Fraser family acquaintance , after all ; Muriel adjudged this edition thicker than the inscribed copy her papa still refused to sell . A butler summoned Mrs. Armour : some visiting Parisian decorator needed a consultation as to the proper citrus yellow for an impending sorbet of a Yellow Room . The florid lady rose , wedged her book into a little Louis XV glass-fronted case , and , in rustling past Miss Fraser , gave one stern daring glance that piqued the teacher 's interest . Only a person this disciplined at intellectual curiosity , only someone with very good hearing  --  lest Mrs. Armour return  --  only someone ruddered by a certain wily nerve , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , she lifted Ruskin . Out of him fell a brown paperbound " novelette . " " The Upstairs Maid 's Impractical Heart or A Cautionary Confession " Muriel , biting her own lip with nearly sick-making pleasure , felt shamed at how much sly and racing joy she felt . Odd to suddenly picture a dun hen 's wing beating , odd to picture cattle staring from a slow train toward the skyline of Chicago , maybe taking that distant form as some mountain suitable for grazing . All while Miss Fraser 's right forefinger  --  tapered , nearly aristocratic from being so long for hire  --  skimmed a sample page : My window-cleaning requiring my mounting the library ladder was now interrupted , as I posed helpless above him . His bedampened lips , then the bristle moustache of the devilishly handsome young master pressed , violent as a bee sting , then melting as bee honey , against my left knee and , no , please , oh , up suddenly beneath the confines of my best white apron . What to do ? Just one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . A regretted yet flooding warmth suffused , then seized me with its wanton hypnotism , just where HE did , between me own strong working-girl 's legs . " Please , sir , stop , for the sake of my employment , for the sake of all that 's ... oh , ooh , sir ... " Miss Fraser replaced the book(s) exactly , then negotiated many hallways ; exiting through a hotel-sized kitchen , she snatched today 's coin . On her long walk home she wondered , might she have mentioned once playing two John Field nocturnes for Mr. Ruskin himself ? He had been not uncomplimentary . The great man 's admonition had been to " see , " then to plainly " say . " But this edict did not include the gloating irony of having seen happily more than certain others ; such comparisons were odious , undignified . The temptation to feel superior toward one 's employer was really too demeaning . And yet Muriel , during the three-mile hike toward home , her carpetbag swinging at arm 's end like some glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbroad amusement and delight . History had ordained that she herself must hide a genuine association with Ruskin beneath this , her own plain wren-brown wrapper , whereas History lathed Sophy Brophy 's pulpy brownish heart in gilt , calf , sesame , and lilies . Stopping to speak to her usual apple boy , Muriel found herself noticing a nearby doorway 's hidden denizen . A prostitute prepared herself for business , for night . The woman already wore a shopgirl suit , but from her purse now pulled a few final properties . This happened at six-thirty or so . The great male working force came pouring onto Chicago 's streets ; un-numbered black bowler hats made an ant-like carapace of bent advancing heads . Here were featureless husbands and bachelors blindly seeking some profitable use for the little energy not squeezed from them all day spent at office desks , counters , stools  --  such warrens , a kind of human stockyard . The far end of the street showed the great clear lake ; the shadowed buildings made a blue-black trough , and down it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonsured moustaches , white celluloid collars . In their buoyant voices  --  joking about beer and sporting wagers  --  Muriel heard a Closing Hour longing she well knew . But , watchful , one hand idly touching apple stems , Miss Fraser tried imagining which of these men might be lonely or nearsighted enough to hire that woman yonder . The whore was nearly Muriel 's age , though an overbold gift at face-painting made that easier to miss . Miss Fraser , shielded by the pyramid of apples , red-and-green , watched the woman square off with a doorway 's full-length mirror . She was a person , plain , uncomplicated-looking , her hair the color of rust . From her black handbag she withdrew two handkerchiefs , folded them into triangular compresses , wedged these into her bodice . The whore posed , rearranging this side , then that . Her head cocked , judging , in a way quite likeable . By finding this mirrored entry to a bankrupt shoe store on a dead-end street , she had secured such public privacy . For Muriel , this lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without stealth , with a fatalistic kind of raptness , daubed on rouge . The gesture looked as joyless and factual as medicating some paper cut , some kitchen burn . Then came the comedy of lipstick application : overriding a series of large flexed faces , this grimace comic , falling into a wide-mouthed comi-tragedy mope , and back to neutral-tragic . But it was the whore 's cloth violets Muriel found most amusing , then arresting . Flowers were moved several times about the jacket , now tucked behind one big ear , then withdrawn with a shy laugh . Pressed to left shoulder , right , lower , no , up . False leaves showed a bitter green  --  blossoms , the correct velvety purple . Once the posy was safety-pinned to just the right spot , the whore tried fluffing it a bit . At best , this nosegay had been a ten-cent ornament . Now it was stiffened and dirty , doubtless dampened by drizzle under sundry streetlamps . As voices of working men boomed nearby , such fussing with the violets grew more frantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First she squeezed flowers , one hand primping , tickling in a manner most encouraging . Her attempts to communicate beauty to this lifeless sprig of wire and gauze became  --  for Muriel  --  first familiar , then spirited , finally endearing . It made Miss Fraser believe that once this woman touched some man 's coat sleeve , she could convince him of anything ; could even transcend her over-advertising . For what might one say to some hefty office manager who 'd paid hard cash for handling larger breasts ? Could such artless padding be made to seem but a flirtation , some courtesan 's high art ? The violets resisted ; so now the young lady bent over her own chest . Rough hands cupped around the purple and  --  with a force of hope that caused the watchful Miss Fraser to emit a low involuntary groan-the girl huffed . She breathed into such shelter as her red hands made , hoping to plump the lifeless flowers . She stood there , craned forward , consulting the mirror , but , no , the things just hung there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror one half-hearted blow , then , shaking her head , pushed violets back into her deep black purse . She straightened her hem , and turned toward the street 's ninety thousand men in ninety thousand suits as black as hers . She turned just as Muriel rushed off , not daring to be seen , not knowing how to hide the look  --  whatever it be  --  now haunting her own stricken face . Chicago , drawing its countless mules and cows and hogs and chickens , constituted a kind of glamorous death wish . Miss Fraser , walking through the crowds , pleased at all the blank and hatted bustle , wondered : What herding sadness had lured her father here , in quest of what ? His own Buffalo Billness , some forty-five-year-old 's last chance at being wild ? To come clear here from Glasgow . But if Miss Fraser had ever wavered in her resolve to go ahead , risk everything on having a picture made  --  her picture made  --  then those three minutes changed that . Her watching the artifice of a plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting with her every trick and frippery , all her wiles and animal instincts , to appear necessary for some one man tonight  --  this helped Muriel understand afresh . How impossible the beautiful gesture in a world so commercial , grinding , dimmed . Walking home very fast , she felt yet more determined . Slung between odd emotional half-tones , not laughter yet not quite a scream . These swings seemed to resemble those huge mask-like grimaces that underwrite a little lipstick 's practiced application . And Muriel determined she must see it through . II A PORTRAIT OF THE PORTRAIT AS A YOUNG WOMAN It took Miss Fraser seven years to collect nearly enough . She earned from sixty-five cents to one dollar per house-call lesson of an hour . Muriel had made inquiries through friends in Glasgow who knew people in London who might know the sort of folks who 'd know the amount you must cough over for a Sargent oil sketch of just your head , or your head and torso , or a family grouping in some characteristic room of the home , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you and yours included , the more you naturally paid . When Muriel announced at last her plan to sail to England in hopes of securing a meeting with Singer Sargent on the chance that he might do a painting of her that she could , in turn , afford , her father threw a red glass ashtray against the hearth . Bouncing , it did not break . He vowed to disown her . Muriel might have wondered which legacy the old man threatened to withhold , but she did not embarrass him with the mere facts of their assigned lives . Papa announced that this Mr. Sargent was , despite his clientele , just a rich American doctor 's son who 'd got above his station . " He is , after all , notwithstanding a certain flair and facility , no Lord Leighton . And , to quote my acquaintance George Moore , if you 'll forgive my saying so , my dear , " Cruelty was the vice of the ancients . Vanity is that of the modern world . Vanity is the last disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had long since made arrangements , fares paid in advance . If her papa could endure this seeming vanity , he would , she believed , eventually thank her . The Professor finally stated his worst fear : " Are you by chance planning to use yer dowrry ? Not that , Muriel . You 're only thirty-eight . Till now , we 've always been so practical . " He took her elongated white hand . She nodded . " This I 'm doing is extremely practical , Papa . Great art always is . You told us to see something and then say in a simple way what we 'd seen . I regret your pain , but you swore the dowry was mine . I will write you , every day . " On April 2 of 1888 , aboard the SS Georgia , Muriel and her taller prettier younger sister Ethel ( eventually my grandmother ) sailed second-class , toward Southampton . In Muriel 's possession , a note to Sargent from a former student , now daughter of the American under-ambassador at the Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the letter , to Ethel 's embarrassment , in plain view of the ship 's steward . It said , " You will wish to welcome Miss Fraser , who is quite the musical personality in her area . " Of the recommendation , Muriel told her sister , " It is either too kind or not kind enough , but I will take it . " And smiled . The crossing proved stormy . Their first night out , the Fraser girls , for so they called themselves as if to stave off age , sat watching their assigned dinner companions go silent , go green , go running . A silver serving cart on casters slid away from the waiter , and here it came rattling past , overturning gilt chairs , reeling comical as a stage drunk . Ethel 's face showed a sleepy unhappiness , and when Muriel saw her sister tasting her own mouth and swallowing too often , she said , " That kind of silliness is no " for the likes of us . Mama has been ill enough long enough for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase this quite decent food in order to stay below holding on to basins , did we , dearest Ethel ? " " No , " Ethel smiled , and that was all , they were fine . By the end of their rough eight-day crossing , only the Frasers appeared for meals during first sitting at their end of the second-class dining room . Waiters congratulated them and flirted with Ethel , taking Muriel if not for her mother then for her chaperone . Not getting seasick was what these sisters had in lieu of large tips , viable jewelry , visible social distinction . That , and their mission . Muriel had allowed herself this single seeming vanity . Though she knew that any of her three younger sisters surpassed her in graceful appearance , she somehow refrained from inviting them to pose . Being depicted was her reward for having imagined depiction itself . Putting aside the fee for Singer Sargent , Muriel had spent nothing beyond it on new clothing to soften the all-too-factual angles of her face and figure . She deduced that Frans Hals must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her customary clothing  --  black , with the cuffs and collars of white lace ( even if machine-made )  --  would speak to Sargent 's racial memory of the Dutch masters . She knew , relentlessly , yet lightly , how she looked . And that can , at the right moment , constitute a power nigh onto the power of beauty itself . Her bearing , her pride , her self-knowledge almost scientific : these became a form of distinction visible only to those equipped to see it . ( And those were all she cared to know . ) Muriel had saved her coins for this one purpose , and plainly now : the painting would be , however plainly , not of Ethel , not Jenny , and not pretty baby Mabel . But , yes  --  of plain pure Muriel herself . She knew that if she gained her wish and achieved the distinguished thing at last , it might someday permit her family , always known as vaguely " artistic , " to perhaps claim one member as an eventual and actual artist . She half-guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , that this future kinsman might  --  blessed with the correct sex and the right leonine profile , buttressed by high-born female support , innocent or no  --  push her own great sacrifice to the Great Plains , where she most wished it , casual , to dwell : the realm of easy assumption , the freedom of his tossing off in passing , and with an air so entitled as to be but half-conscious , " Oh , did I mention that my great-aunt posed for John Singer Sargent ? No ? " And how easily she could then imagine his bitterly pleasing tonic little fillip , " Yes , Muriel . " On landing , they proceeded to the Cotswold village of Broadway , where Mr. Singer Sargent summered . The buildings were made of a yellow local stone , and , come evening , the sisters held hands , for the town glowed golden as some candy-tin litho-chromium of Jerusalem , but with foxgloves . Having settled at the Lygon Arms and sent , via messenger , their note of introduction and a short letter explaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reply . Muriel and Ethel , paying full price at the village 's best hotel ( knowing they would need the added respectability its notepaper afforded ) , waited eleven days . Mr. Sargent would then return from Italy . In her letter , Muriel found herself unwilling to mention wanting to be depicted ; it surprised her how she hesitated between saying " I wish to be painted " and " portrayed . " They sounded both too formal and too personal , pathetic as the shopgirl with her violets , presumptuous as Sophy Brophy . So instead , Muriel merely asked leave to pay a social call . What I admire in recalling this now-famous family account of my great-aunt 's quest ( a sensible and scrupulous woman and , from all reports , the possessor of a surprisingly louche sense of humor ) , what I admire is precisely her middle-class persistence as she stormed the citadel of international connections , of aesthetical hauteur . She and Ethel concocted ambitious walking tours of local country churches , their red Baedeker guide suspended before the pince-nez they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , they 'd noticed that better-traveled Americans ' Baedekers were worn , sun-faded , or ringed with Burgundy wine stains . So , in the Frasers ' tiny stateroom , giggling , they 'd taken turns stepping on the cover , wearing it to tatters that suggested , first , experience , then an extreme sophistication that finally verged upon world-weariness . They began to economize , taking only the provided breakfast scone and tea , then hiking abroad . They returned from one such stroll , April 21 , to find a note at the desk . " Tea at four then ? Here only briefly , I fear . Courteously , JSS . " Need I say that , wearing fine black hats , they arrived when all the church bells , all the village mantel clocks , were gonging in uneven agreement of the exact hour ? The sisters were greeted by a young Italian manservant of distinguished appearance but seemingly no common language . He simply pointed to the proper room . The house was all windows and looked out onto a garden abounding in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sargent 's masterwork of the Academy show two years previous . The sisters were left seated alone so long that Muriel explored a bit . The chamber in which they waited had the over-utilized air of a first-class train station waiting room , and , in the corner , she noticed two stray calling cards , one announcing Lord and Lady Rocksavage . But Ethel soon hissed that someone was coming and Muriel dove for a chair . In strode a man who seemed the hired and presentable fellow who would , in turn , introduce some eccentric disheveled artist . Muriel felt relieved to recognize , via a self-portrait reproduced two inches square , Mr. Sargent himself . Austere , tall , and impeccable as some bank trust officer in a three-piece black suit , he wore the simplest of watch chains . And yet he seemed to have pop-eyes and a beard that claimed too much of his neck ; he was not nearly so handsome as her papa . Singer Sargent spoke in a ripened anglicized American accent . His manners were exemplary , if a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister not to let on that they 'd sailed precisely to beseech Maestro for a sitting . And when he perfunctorily asked what had brought them abroad , Muriel answered a bit too loudly , " The churches . " " A worthy pursuit . I am expecting , I fear , a German couple to join us . Perhaps they 've been delayed . Was your crossing difficult ? " And you felt he had asked this of more than a few other , earlier Americans . Muriel was candid in explaining about the runaway silver serving cart that , in dancing a sickening rondelet from table to table , had sent the few remaining diehards herding to the rail . " We determined not to be sick and , in deciding , seemed to make it so . " She wondered if she 'd been too explicit when the painter saw fit to quote a limerick he admitted had become a recent " craze " of his , a ditty employed to amuse such fidgety children as sat for him : There was a young lady of Spain Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But again and again And again and again and again . There was laughter , relaxation . " I am especially susceptible to your watercolors , sir . And it is , I believe , for that medium , as well as your oil portraits , that posterity will note you . Do you use both mediums in a single studio ? Might I be bold enough to see where you manage all you so wondrously manage ? " He nodded and led them down a series of dark halls . " Chicago , " he said aloud . " There 's a Mrs. Armour whose picture I believe I once did . " " Yes , I see Mrs. Armour now and again . And come to think on it  --  again and again and again . " He laughed , half-turning to reconsider his visitor . " I believe she was in the theater , before ? " and his tone was so assured and invited such fun . Muriel , quite primed to use Faure 's celestial " Requiem " as her impending topic , could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid her one dollar per hour . " Not to put too fine a point upon it , " Muriel set forth , " but Mrs. Maitlandt Armour was , one hears , Sophy Brophy of Gerhardt Raymond 's Variety Beauties . I 'm afraid there 's a slightly malicious story about her , not that she 's fully to blame . You doubtless know about her inviting Paderewski to play after dinner ? " If John Sargent had heard , he was gracious in pretending otherwise . It took Muriel 's fullest concentration to rattle out her tale while arriving in the mammoth studio  --  the three easels , the Steinway concert grand , the upended mahogany and ebony steamer trunk with its heavy bouquet of peonies . The room revealed a wealth of reflecting surfaces wherein it was impossible to know which detail was painted and which actual , and which , actually , both . Yes , backstage at a Paderewski concert , it seems the pouter-pigeon Mrs. Armour invited the great musician to play at " my mansion , " after dinner the following evening . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . " Fifteen thousand dollars , forty minutes ' music , of my choosing . " " That in itself , " she replied , " will present no difficulty . But I feel I must needs warn you to use the staff entrance and that , after playing , I will not sanction your speaking to , or in any way mingling with , my distinguished guests . " " Ahh , " he smiled , " in that case , madam , TEN thousand dollars . " The painter , chuckling , asked Muriel to repeat the precise phrasing . Seeing he planned to use it , she felt she 'd already been , in some small manner , portrayed by him . To be useful : that was all Muriel had ever wanted . To practice your lifetime 's Czerny exercises but for the sake of a final performance , not more mere practice . To be of such thorough Use made you so richly mortal that your spirit residue remained , luminous , of continual compass-like use to others . Art gave your poor life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Music taught itself through her . Yet having arrived here , having determined a way to accomplish both eternal use and eternal pleasure  --  how , now , to ask ? She did not mention having learned through intermediaries that watercolor portraits , while rarely done , could be had for less than $350 , while oils began at upwards of $800 to $1,200 . In the wall safe at the Lygon Arms , Muriel had left her best jet-beaded reticule . It now contained but $600 , and yet from that sum she and her sister must return to Southampton and then take the long train ride from New York to boomtown Chicago . " I 'd begun a little watercolor , just to get my hand in again , " and he gestured down at the broad white page marked with traces of those pink flowers set on the upmost end of the sleek trunk just opposite . Muriel decided against stepping over too suddenly . And , having now achieved his studio  --  her dowry long since spent to get here , her life savings dwindling fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt with the great painter , the less likely it became that she might state just why she 'd come . " Yes , " he said , leaning on the table where the watercolor rested , " I believe Mrs. Armour is the first I painted among a group there known to some , I am told , as " the meat people , ' ' " and he gave a grin as noncommittal as a grin can be . Muriel recalled the portrait itself , remarking inwardly that he 'd at least paid Mrs. Sophy Brophy Armour the compliment of elongation . The artist mentioned how glad he was to be here in the Cotswolds again , how he regretted having to rush off the very next morning . And Muriel paused in patrolling the studio , felt her sister 's eyes upon her . " Is it customary , " Ethel herself intended to try something , " for you to accept appointments from those who might wish to " sit to you " for a portrait ? " " Months and years in advance . " Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should soon like to get beyond that ... " He seemed to dare Muriel to state her history as wished , not assigned . The fabled Seeing would be hers ; but perhaps , she now saw , the Telling of the vision was not to be ... In order to save a few pence , she had not eaten lunch , believing this might further enhance her pallor . Now Muriel regretted that . She felt dizzied at being so near her hope and yet finding herself too unlike the Sophy Brophys of this world to just come out with it . Ethel , stricken , kept staring at the older sister , bobbing her head in a manner touching if a bit grotesque , as if to say , " Go ahead . Ask now . " " Mrs. Armour , " Muriel held fire , " at least has the distinction of having been set down by you . Tomorrow you leave ? " He absently nodded , staring at the drooping peonies and the highly polished trunk that reflected the flowers ' glowing aura ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash and soon seemed utterly lost to mere conversation . Did the Fraser girls distract him from his work or inspire him to go on with it ? He was not much noticing them . He had two thousand visitors a year . Outside the immense window , Muriel noted one yellowed leaf fall from an elm , spiraling to the lawn , its descent modest , perfect , final . There came the childhood memory of one brown hen 's translucent wing beating beneath a door 's black rubber blade , murdered by a glazed entrance that seemed welcoming but was , being mirror , only glass disguised as sky . And all at once the impossibility of her mission broke upon her . She saw that precisely what gave her more inward stature than the meat people was just what would prevent her coming out with it , asking him to " do " her , " save " her , even for a fee . Even if she 'd somehow assembled the correct secret amount . A wing-whipped lightness set to roaring in her ears . Trembling seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feeling stricken , an unearthly clarity settled . Some flooding white intelligence claimed her . " So , " was her thought . Finally  --  Muriel Fraser had proven to herself ( yet only to herself ) her possession of it , of the distinguished thing , at last . And this very distinction prevented her naming that which she most wanted , wanted for reasons too urgent to state , for motives far beyond mere personal vanity , from an impulse as steadying and noble as any she 'd encountered on a five-line musical staff or seen occupying any carved gilt frame . It would only come to pass in her imagination . But THERE , it had been seen , then plainly stated , and therefore it was true , forever . Maestro liked to talk , during . Deft , half-absently , he applied water paint . The Italian activated a phonograph with a bugle like a mammoth celluloid morning glory . Mixing bowls dripping with dried pigment occupied a sleigh-shaped daybed parked in one swagged corner of the glassy room . Behind a door loomed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the costume in which Ellen Terry had been painted by the master , setting a crown upon her own head , in her role of Lady Macbeth . Maestro took up the theme of churches . He recommended ones in the neighborhood worth visiting and then ranged farther afield , mentioning hideous over-restorations of otherwise perfect a cappella jewels in his adored Tuscany . As he spoke with the fluency of his brush technique , he squeezed conversational dots of tubed watercolor paint upon a white glass to his right , blending these easily as he recombined casual spoken topics . The Italian appeared and disappeared , bearing clean white rags and bearing carafes of clear water . These he arranged and dispensed around the man in banker 's clothes , the servant performing his sacramental duties with an acolyte 's half-bored , half-awed matter-of-factness . By means of frequent recranking , he kept the tenor aria endlessly repeating . The late daylight seemed to coat the studio 's carved chairs , brass helmets , the Chinese screen backing one mammoth bouquet of disintegrating peonies set atop the handsome trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , soon both at once . Just as my great-aunt understood she could not ask ; just as she understood that seven years ' savings , the daily plan , the apples , had been in the service of practice , not performance , of getting here , not getting painted ; just as she halted , giddied , alongside the trunk that Sargent idly if intently painted  --  just as she most wished she 'd eaten both lunch and breakfast , as she stood wondering if all the postponed seasickness were about to strike , there came an insistent , indeed heart-stopping pounding on the front door . " That , " he sighed , " will be the Germans . Only Germans can knock comme ca . " And he had set aside his brush when he chanced to look her way . Feeling light-headed ( she really should 've eaten , she really should 've been born a genius , rich or beautiful , or all three ) , she had leaned upon the trunk , to prevent a crude stagger forward or perhaps even a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the slight pressure of her pianist 's hand caused the petals of the lowest peony to drop , with half a humid sigh , around her tensed white forefinger and thumb on which all weight now pivoted . The chin was lifted , accidentally displaying the long pale neck that her crippled mother had mercilessly and often described as , " along with Muriel 's hands , her one distinguished feature . " The painter saw the face set atop a neck craning back for breath till it accidentally craned toward seeming almost swanlike , and something , something in the woman 's fortitude at trying to hide her vast disappointment , to hide her vast distinction ( which was of the self-same Chartres size ) , something in the fading light , maybe even something obdurate and half-attractive in the bone structure of her sinewy ridged side-face , something there revealed a respect for art so surrendered , so complete , it could not be ordered on demand . And one felt in the artist 's straightening spine , in a bracing almost alarmed , that something had annealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly grave as , reconsidering , he paused , then barked four syllables of Italian at his manservant . One heard the front door open , a low explanation , a grumbled guttural protest , then the door most quietly closing . And the lifted dampened brush returned to motion ? Miss Fraser , stay , please , as you are . Just so . May I impose on you . There IS something . And , with watercolor , we shall soon know . You are quite well ? " " Quite , " said she . " Well , " she , superstitious , added . Muriel stood facing the light , her long fingers supporting her , fingers strengthened into beauty by simple work  --  the infinite pressings over smaller hands , the countless virtuoso demonstrations with which she ended each lesson . This veteran hand was now bordered by supple ticklish petals that had made their only sound in falling . The servant arrived just as the aria wound , ratcheting , down ; knowing the signs , he did not renew its spiraling blare . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common mailing tape . The paper was of excellent nappy texture and was the size of , say , the Declaration of Independence . With music stopped , you could hear his brush now rush , now stutter ; and Muriel could feel his gaze upon her , warming like the mustard plasters poor Mama liked , and there was something therapeutic , being so in the gaze one had just so totally forsworn . Popular journals claimed that Singer Sargent sometimes played his studio piano to cheer and refresh his famous subjects ; and Muriel had come to occupy the useful pleasure of posing for fourteen minutes , just long enough to let herself wonder what he would play when and if he played . She was just deciding how to work into impending talk her admiration for his admiration of Faure when " There , " he said . " Beg pardon ? " Muriel offered . And instantly regretted this common little phrase , wishing she 'd merely turned and lifted one eyebrow , but there it was . " I 've taken the liberty , " Singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No criticism of the hat itself implied , you understand , Miss . But only for compositional purposes . " Muriel stretched slightly ( her neck would be stiff during most of the return crossing , so concentrated a pose had she so briefly taken ) . Ethel meekly rose , then sat again , then stood like a concerned relation called in out of the doctor 's antechamber to hear the verdict on a loved one 's life . " It 's the merest suggestion of you , naturally . However ... , " and he squinted , stroking the right side of his moustache with the thumb of a hand still holding its brush 's long maroon handle . It was Ethel , clutching her handbag as if still braving the wooden sidewalks of some dangerous prairie metropolis , who first took her place beside the somber man in black . " Oh , Muriel ... , " the sister cried . And the painter smiled , as with a belief that if the first witness of a portrait exclaimed not to the artist but to its subject  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maestro , " Muriel herself ventured , stopping behind him . " However shall I ... ? You see it is " I ' as I feel , as well as " I " as God , alas , saw fit to somewhat carelessly make me . " She 'd not planned the statement . And it , Muriel admitted later , helped make up for that dreadful tartish Middle West " Beg pardon . " Though not completely . " Shall we finish our tea here , " he asked and told them . And soon they all sat in the carved chairs they would later see in portraits of prime ministers , royal couples , august artistic eminences , and milk-white moonflower ingenues . They did not speak further of the picture until Muriel stood to leave . Maestro offered , " Shall we have it shipped to you , then ? " " What a bother that must cause you . If the paint is quite dry and if it might be rolled , perhaps I could venture to do something so simple as take it ... with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of watercolors ' many merits  --  their portability , so to speak . " Again in insurmountable yet , one felt , idiomatic Italian , he ordered that a pasteboard tube be brought , and , before becoming hidden , the picture was studied again . " Are you averse , Maestro , to signing your works ? Or does it interfere with the overall design , or whatever ? " The " whatever " she would later rue , but at least it was less bad than that beef-jerky American " Beg pardon " earlier . " No . " He took up the brush and bowed forward , left a trace of name not unprominently placed . " About my homage , your remuneration , or what have you ... , " she began , dogged , Scottish , stifled but determined . And really , now , for the first time in the seven years since she first labored toward this , Miss Muriel Fraser felt embarrassed at her half-coarse daring ; it was like some pastor 's pious eldest daughter unaccountably choosing the traveling career of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her motives in all she had attempted . But now Muriel could not imagine returning home without having achieved this one distinguished thing via fate 's own patronage . The prospect became such a sadness , it belatedly weakened her . There was a louder knocking at the front door , and somehow this made them all laugh . This time he seemed to order his servant to refrain from even answering . So , the signature blown until quite dry , Maestro rolled the picture with a wrenching matter-of-factness and popped it  --  no other word would do  --  into its tube . And then , jovial as a mayor , he was walking them to the door . " This has been quite refreshing , spending time with two of my countrywomen who 've remained so utterly unstudied . You would not believe the pretension of certain Americans who seek one out here . " " It can be a little frightful , " Muriel offered , and then Ethel , the door now opened , saw fit to risk , " Though they doubtless mean well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all , perhaps . " And smiled . He seemed pleased enough , but as the door was nearly closed , they heard him cough some orders to his servant , or indicate social relief , going on to the next thing . And they felt no doubt as they strode , arm in arm , back to the hotel that Maestro had , for all his courtesy , already largely forgotten them . Maybe the Germans must now be dealt with ? Maybe he needed dinner ? Surely he had moved on to persons more significant and more lovely and with actual money . But the Fraser girls , their hen-brown mailing tube held before and against them , they did not mind . The two drifted past the front desk , failing to acknowledge the greeting of the bellman . Only when alone together did they embrace . Then unexpectedly they sobbed . They could not stop weeping . " Poor Mama , " Muriel said , as if explaining everything . The sisters seemed to cry for injustices endured . And not only by their loved ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her own breath might resurrect cloth violets . To be paid , in flipped coins , from a macaroon tin . The difficulty of quite literally every day on earth . How very odd that achieving some small token of justice should release in you not license toward a pure lit joy but descent into such careening blackened rage . The Fraser girls were both so wracked by heaves and bleats , they soon commenced laughing . They pointed to each other 's tear-painted face . It was only after ordering a full cream-tea , served in their rooms ( an additional expense ) , only then did they dare turn up the gas lamp , and take out the picture , and look at it . Still holding on to each other , the sisters agreed it had the grandeur of his massive oil portraits but the intimacy , the atmospheric jeweled flash , of his best watercolors . It resembled Muriel but made her look if no prettier , thank God  --  for flattery per se was her worst fear  --  then better . Just " better " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply , more visibly herself than ever before . Come morning , Muriel would send , by messenger , the jet-worked black purse containing American bills in the amount of $400 . Along with it , a three-sentence note : " I know the Caravaggios and have been painted by Sargent . I can now say I have experienced the ultimate . My thanks , and my sister 's , for your hospitality . Muriel Fraser . " ( Her original note contained the postscript : " Have the Germans re-stormed the citadel ? " But , after consulting her sister-an executive secretary , after all , who had used three years ' future vacations to come along  --  Muriel reconsidered and  --  wisely , I believe  --  copied the lines afresh , without that over-familiar aside . ) By return , the messenger brought the artist 's simple vellum notepaper , " The pleasure was all on my side , I assure you . JSS , " and the reticule . When Muriel glimpsed the money still folded inside , she had a sinking spell . It was only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket round the subject 's legs that Ethel thought to actually count the money . Maestro had seen fit to keep back $200 but had returned the rest and , of course , the handsome little beadwork bag itself . The boat fare , the cost of boarding for three weeks , the travel within England , and the return trip to Chicago  --  added to the price of the portrait  --  cost my great-aunt Muriel nearly $900 . Her dowry and savings gone , she would  --  without regret  --  take on years of additional night pupils to help justify and offset the single great expense of her life . But , she was later told , those with four times that amount to spend , those with pedigrees and ambassadorial letters of a magnitude far beyond even those wangled by Wrigleys , Armours , Palmers , and Fields , even those persons failed to achieve an audience with the great man , much less a picture . Framed in the thinnest of stark silver frames ( Muriel believed that gold smacked of stockyard owners ' carnivorous pride ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowded little parlor benefited so from the picture 's style , force , and lightly distinguished presence . Younger sisters sometimes said they mimi5sed consulting the central looking gla5s , but Muriel 's mother asked to be carried in and propped before the painting , hours at a time . It soothed her as nothing else did . They decided to take down the peacock hangings that flanked the fireplace . True , the crackled plaster showed , but now it seemed more eccentric , less pitiful . Though Papa was terribly critical of the boys brave enough to court his girls ( such swains all proved to be mere Americans ? ) , two sisters did bring home nice young men to see " the family Sargent . " Three boys " genteel mothers came to pay respects . Muriel was asked to lend the picture to an exhibition in New York . She consented . Two Chicago papers reproduced Sargent 's portrait of her . One caption referred to her as " the distinguished local pianist and sometime coach to the finest of our youthful Lakeside keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Art Institute of Chicago , the gift of its subject . The woman shown looks if not beautiful , then doggedly high-minded and , far better , a bit mischievous . Her expression contains , in fact , qualities associated with the Scottish national character . Like the bagpipe 's wailing tone , her smile combines pagan playfulness with a mournful Nordic solemnity . ( Golf , the major export of Scotland , with its elaborate strategy for a dubious end , might offer another example . ) Arranged in profile against a pearl-gray suggestion of windowpanes and drapery , one hand 's tripod of tensed fingers rests among the scattered petals as she stands confronting daylight ; she seems between appointments , lost in some personal rewarding reverie . She is pale but fixed , and the one depicted corner of her mouth shows something gleeful , as if the subject is plotting or , indeed , achieving , at the very moment of depiction , a goal , a comeuppance , a sweet payback fervently sought . Is the joke that an unwed , unrich , quite smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained something so long wished for ? It is an expression that might be termed " intellectual happiness "  --  that joy some feel to be a contradiction in terms but which , made flesh here , quite plainly is not . Here use and pleasure , practice and performance , are joined at last and for all time . The distinguished thing , intact and , via clarion water-clear understatement , preserved , preserved . The wide dark hat and a hastily rendered lace collar on a black black dress , all this could have only been done very fast , in speedy watercolor , by a genius of some sort , between other appointments , all at once , by accident . His accident , her plan . At the Art Institute , this is the single watercolor in a room of six massive vertical oils . The others limn department-store heiresses and meat ladies . The oil portraits can seem more intent on flattering the costly Worth dresses than ladies ' dashingly rendered local faces , their supplemental chins hastily euphemized but nonetheless suggested . One lady confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she holds a riding crop . But there 's an unfortunate assumption that she is about to hop sidesaddle onto the beast and whip it into service as an unwilling form of transportation . Just this April , I myself loitered in the echoing chamber of white marble . For forty minutes , I listened with feigned detachment as talkative gallery visitors discussed the museum 's cluster of its choicest Sargents . I swear that a hundred-odd years after the picture was done and forty-some years after its subject 's death , the picture 's freshness still seems to grow . After being overawed ( even somewhat enjoyably snubbed ) by the nine-foot oils , the more diligent lookers often come to rest before this , the smallest painting of the seven . I love to see viewers , after first assessing the insistent oils , linger here longest . We find a woman vertical beyond an upturned steamer trunk , as if some household is in transit , and yet a still life has been improvised atop the trunk where one outstretched and elegant white hand pivots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied blood . What best distinguishes this picture from its mannequin companions is the way it presents a person plainly meditating on something , some fact or idea visibly satisfying . Simply put , it is a watercolor of a woman not handsome , not hideous , but shown , under her overhanging eave of a black hat , thinking something . I can imagine Muriel , just before she surrendered her small masterwork to the Institute . I see her just prior to achieving her clan 's ( and her own ) permanent detour past that squat alley entrance marked DELIVERIES AND STAFF , just before yielding to History as she somewhat wished it . I picture Muriel seated at the parlor 's rent-to-own Chickering upright , long since rented unto ownership . A slow sweet snoring from one room away means Mama , resting well . Outside , a roving street vendor cries , " Nice and sharp , let me put the edge back on those knives and scissors . Cut into anything . Get " em nice and sharp for you today ? " Over that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite Field nocturne , at noon . Notes accumulate under and around her like brush strokes , like paychecks ; like all the pinfeathers required to make one airworthy wing , angel white or hen brown . She touches keys while studying the mantel 's picture that , through the saving mystery of Art , is notable precisely because it is not merely herself , and yet somewhat is , herself . Muriel plays today , for free , for joy , for no one but herself . The museum affixed a gilt label to Muriel 's own simple silver frame and dove-gray silk mat . The museum adjudged her choices unimprovable . It reads : " ' Portrait of a Lady , in Black "  --  watercolor . Subject : Miss Muriel Fraser ( American )  --  by John Singer Sargent ( American , 1856-1925 ) . Executed , April 21 , 1888.  --  A Gift of the Sitter . " So all this , you see , underwrites her permission , her blessing on my artful offhandedness in finally remarking to you , with a carelessness oh so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the distinguished thing , our one distinguished thing , at last : Oh , did I mention that my great-aunt was painted by John Singer Sargent . No ?  --  Yes , our practical one , Muriel . Allan Gurganus is the author of Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All , a novel , and White People , a collection of stories .
