" This telescope does n't work  --  it has never given me good star images . " I ca n't remember how many times I 've heard that line at a star party . More often than not , the telescope is fine . The most common problem that produces fuzzy star images in telescopes occurs when the elements of the optical system are not precisely aligned . Rather than deliver a clean , small , image , the telescope scatters light and provides distorted images . Proper collimation is simple to do and will bring out the best in your telescope 's performance . Yet r some reason many amateur astronomers put off collimating their telescopes . Do n't become one of these collimation procrastinators . Do yourself a big favor and check periodically to see that the telescope 's optics are properly aligned . If they are n't , follow the simple steps below to bring your Newtonian or Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope back into top-notch operating condition . COLLIMATING YOUR NEWTONIAN Before discussing collimation , let 's review the components of a simple Newtonian telescope . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary mirror , which sits in a cell at the bottom of the tube . Light striking the primary is reflected back up the tube to a second , smaller mirror called the secondary or diagonal . The secondary rests in a tiny cell held in place by a " spider , " two or more thin strips of metal . Light reflected from the primary bounces off the secondary and passes through the tube and into the eyepiece . When you collimate your telescope 's optical train , you will be making sure that the incoming light travels along a straight path from the primary mirror to your eye . Once the optics are collimated , the improvement in image quality will seem almost magical . To work this magic you do n't need anything special , only a screwdriver , an Allen wrench , a needle or X-Acto knife , and an old plastic film canister . The actual work should be done in two steps  --  rough collimation during the daylight and star-testing to precisely align at night . Before you start , remove the plastic lid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see a small dimple . Use a needle to care fully make a small hole in the center of the dimple . Then , using an X-Acto knife or razor blade , cut off the bottom of the can . Replace the lid on the can and you will have a sighting device . This little collimation tool will keep your eye centered in the eyepiece holder as you look into the telescope . DAYLIGHT ROUGH COLLIMATION When you 're ready to begin , set up your scope during the day and take a few minutes to inspect the mirror cell at the bottom of the tube . At the back o the cell , facing out , is a set of screws . Some cells have three thumbscrews positioned 120 deg apart . Other scopes have three sets of two screws set at the same angle , called push-pull screws . Whether the scope has three or six screws , their function is the same : to move the mirror in the cell and direct the light reflected by the mirror . Next , find out how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-to four-vane spider but some have a single stalk holding the secondary in place . Check to see which your scope has and where the screws are that secure the secondary and its holder . Take out the eyepiece and rack the focuser in as far as it will go . Now when you look into the empty focuser , you 'll see an image of the primary mirror reflected in the secondary . Place the film canister in the eyepiece holder and peek through the hole . You 'll see an image that consists of , from the outer edge to the center , the bottom edge of the focusing tube , the secondary mirror , the reflection of the primary mirror , and the reflection of the secondary mirror . Your first job is to center the secondary so that it shows a reflection of the entire primary mirror . Loosen the screws holding the secondary and gently move the secondary in its holder so that you can see the primary and the clips that hold it in its cell . Move the secondary until this image appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighten down the screws gently . Now that the secondary is positioned , let 's turn to the primary . At this point when you look into the sighting device , the image of the primary should appear to be centered in the actual secondary . But is the image of the secondary and the spider centered in the primary ? Probably not . This is where the screws on the main mirror cell come in . Using these screws , adjust the primary mirror alignment until the image of the secondary and the spider vanes are centered in the reflection you see in the sighting device . The optics are now roughly collimated . STAR TESTING FOR PRECISE COLLIMATION Precision collimation is slightly more demanding . The preferred method for final alignment is the star test , which will tell you how much to adjust your telescope to bring it into collimation and what , if anything , is wrong with your telescope 's optics . After nightfall on a clear evening , take your scope out , let it cool down , and insert a moderate power eyepiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkler near the zenith . Center the star in your field of view and rack it out of focus . You want to place your eye outside the focal plane , so rack the focuser toward you . As you move the star out of focus , you 'll notice that the star assumes a disk shape , called the star 's Airy disk . The Airy disk is composed of a series of concentric bright and dark rings that should be circular and look like a tiny bull 's eye . If the disk is a bit lopsided , you will have to use the adjustment screws at the back of the mirror cell to change it to a precisely round shape . Running back and forth between the focuser and the back end of the scope can get tiring , so if possible get a friend to help you . What you want to do is collimate the telescope so that the dark hole you see in the disk on both sides of focus is precisely centered within the out-of-focus star image . At the outset , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit off-center . You 'll need to determine which screw to turn and which way to turn it by trial and error . As you begin , make the adjustments to the screws very slowly . A twist that takes the adjustment screw through 360 deg may only send the image out of the field and frustrate you . Only very slight adjustments are necessary . Try to determine the direction of the long axis of the Airy disk and turn the screw so that the image becomes more circular . As you change the disk into a bull 's eye , the image is going to move from the center of the field of view . With each adjustment , no matter how slight , you will have to reposition the image in the center of the field . Take your time and make the Airy disk as circular as you can . When you think you 've finished , replace the medium power eyepiece with a high power eyepiece . Refocus the image ( but not completely into focus ) by moving your eye closer to the focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece will allow you to further refine the shape of the Airy disk until you get it as close to a circle as possible . Once you 've finished , you should be able to snap the image into focus and see a pinpoint star image . Congratulations , you 're finished ! Unless your telescope gets bumped around a lot , the collimation you just performed should last a long time . However , it 's not a bad idea to give your scope a quick star test before each observing session , or at least at periodic intervals . COLLIMATING YOUR SCHMIDT-CASSEGRAIN Another popular type of telescope is the Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope ( SCT ) . As with the Newtonian , the heart of this scope is a primary mirror and a secondary . But unlike the Newtonian 's main mirror , the SCT 's primary is permanently aligned at the factory and the only way to collimate the optics is by adjusting the secondary , which is attached to the back of the telescope 's front-mounted corrector plate . Begin your SCT collimation by examining the secondary mirror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 deg from each other . ( On some models these screws may a be covered by a piece of plastic you will have to gently pry off . ) These are the adjustment screws you must use to collimate the scope . In the center of this group there may be another , larger , screw or nut . That holds the secondary in its cell and you do n't want to touch it ! To collimate your SCT , take it out under a clear sky , remove the star diagonal , and insert a medium power eyepiece . Locate a second-magnitude star near the zenith and throw it out of focus . As the star image expands , you will see the Airy disk expand to a bright disk with a dark center . Right now we want to do a rough collimation of the scope and we 'll ignore the Airy disk and its rings for the time being . The disk is the out-of-focus image of the star , and the dark center is the silhouette of the secondary . Is the dark spot centered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where in the bright disk the spot is located and make the adjustment by turning the screw that most closely corresponds to the dark spot 's position . As with the Newtonian , continue this until the dark spot is centered in the bright disk . Again , each movement of the adjustment screws will move the image you are looking at across the field of view , so take your time , make slight turns , and re-center the image after each adjustment . Next , replace the medium power eyepiece with a high power eyepiece and re-center the star you have been using . Bring the star out of focus until you can see the Airy disk and its rings . Fine tune the collimation by turning the adjustment screw until the Airy disk looks perfectly circular . Why worry about all of this ? Well , here 's one tale that should inspire you . A friend recently finished work on his pride and joy , a 20-inch Newtonian . Initially disappointed with the images it gave , particularly those of the planets , he spent a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument . Then everything fell into place , he reports , and " once the scope was properly collimated , the views were spectacular ! It was like using a totally different telescope . " A telescope is a precision optical instrument , one you have probably put a lot of time , effort , and money into obtaining . So it 's in your best interest to get the most satisfying images you can from it . Make your hobby and the dollars you 've spent for equipment pay off by collimating your telescope properly . It 's the single most important step you can take to ensure sparkling , razor-sharp views of distant galaxies and colorful planets and stars . Following the instructions discussed above is a mighty small price to pay . Besides at the next star party , you can tell others how to collimate their scope and obtain clearer images , too . Michael Porcellino is an amateur astronomer living in Chicago , Illinois . His last article for ASTRONOMY was " How to Clean a Mirror " ( March 1992 issue ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @           @x The debate over what happened to Armenians in World War I-era Ottoman Anatolia continues to polarize historians and politicians . Armenian historians argue that Ottoman forces killed more than one million Armenians in a deliberate act of genocide. n1 Other historians -- most famously Bernard Lewis and Guenter Lewy -- acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died but question whether this was a deliberate act of genocide or rather an outgrowth of fighting and famine. n2 In recent decades , the debate has shifted from academic to legislative grounds . In 2001 , the French parliament voted to recognize an Armenian genocide. n3 In 2007 , U.S. political leaders narrowly averted an Armenian genocide resolution in the House of Representatives . While Armenian activists lobby politicians to recognize an Armenian genocide formally , which is likely to be a first step toward a demand for collective reparations , and genocide studies scholars seek to close the book on the Armenian narrative , it is ironic that many of the archives that contain documentation from the period remain untapped . <p> L : THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arsivleri ( the Ottoman Archives division of the Prime Minister 's Office ) in Istanbul fully opened its doors to scholars regardless of their nationality or subject of research . The Ottoman Empire 's central state archives originally consisted of two groups of documents : the records of the Imperial Council and of the Grand Vizier 's office . From time to time , the state added other collections , for example , the records of the finance departments and the Cadastral Survey Office . The government registers include copies of the texts of imperial orders and decrees sent to provincial officials and judges and replies to reports from across the empire . They relate to questions of law and order , state revenues , military arrangements , foreign relations , administrative assignments , and other matters submitted for the sultan 's consideration . Survey registers of rural and urban populations and their production convey figures and other information collected for administrative purposes . Likewise , there are specific registers dealing with the non-Muslim peoples of the Ottoman Empire , such as church registers and registers concerning other non-Muslim communities ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain valuable information on the question of Turkish-Armenian relations. ( n4 ) <p> There are approximately 150 million documents that span every period and region of the Ottoman realm in the stacks and vaults of the Ottoman Archives . Each day , new collections in these Ottoman archives are opened to researchers . All these extensive records are well preserved and organized . <p> The first published catalog of Ottoman archival holdings appeared in 1955 and consisted of ninety pages of archival inventory and commentary. n5 Archivist Attila etin followed in 1979 with a more extensive catalog , which is also available in Italian. n6 As the classifying and organizing of the archives continued , the catalog grew . The 1992 edition is 634 pages long . The expanded 1995 compilation provides access to even more documents . Revised editions are to be forthcoming from time to time , as more detailed descriptions become available for the various fonds or individual record groups. ( n7 ) <p> Ottoman archival documentation constitutes an unequaled trove of information about how people lived from the fifteenth through the early twentieth centuries in a territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Topkapi Palace Museum at Istanbul , argues that the history of the Ottoman Empire should not be written without Ottoman sources. n8 He is not alone in this . His position is buttressed by a number of specialists in the study of the Ottoman state and society . Albert Hourani , for example , the late British scholar of Middle Eastern affairs , argued that his best advice to history students considering Middle East specialization would be to " learn Ottoman Turkish well and learn also how to use Ottoman documents , since the exploitation of Ottoman archives , located in Istanbul and in smaller cities and towns , is perhaps the most important task of the next generation . " ( n9 ) <p> L : THE ARCHIVES AND THE ARMENIANS There are few comprehensive sources about Armenian life in Anatolia outside of Ottoman archival sources . Diplomatic records , such as those cited by Armenian historian Vahakn Dadrian , as the basis for discussions among genocide scholars are spotty and intertwined with wartime politics. n10 The Ottoman Ministry of the Interior ( Dahiliye Nezareti ) was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armenian population . The collection of the ministry documents covers the period from 1866 to 1922 and consists of 4,598 registers or notebooks . It is classified according to twenty-one subcollections , according to office of origin . Among the available documents in the Ottoman archives are several dozen registers containing the records of the deliberations and actions of the Council of Ministers , which set policies , received reports , and discussed problems that arose regarding the relocations and other wartime events . The minutes of its meetings , deliberations , resolutions , and decisions are bound in 224 volumes covering the years 1885 through 1922 . These registers include each and every decree pertaining to the decision to relocate the Ottoman Armenians away from the war zones during World War I. The Records Office of the Sublime Porte ( Babiali Evrak Odasi ) also contains substantial documentation , including the correspondence between the grand vizier and the ministries , as well as the central government and the provinces that can illuminate the events of 1915. ( n11 ) <p> It is ironic , therefore , as politicians seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating Armenian issues have actually consulted the Ottoman archives . As Australian historian Jeremy Salt has explained , <p> The Ottoman archives remain largely unconsulted . When so much is missing from the fundamental source material , no historical narrative can be called complete and no conclusions can be balanced . If the Ottoman sources are properly utilized , the way in which the Armenian question is understood is bound to change. ( n12 ) <p> There is little explanation as to why more historians do not consult the Ottoman archives . They are open to all scholars . Bernard Lewis , Cleveland Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University , who has worked extensively in the Ottoman archives since 1949 , has argued that " the Ottoman archives are in the care of a competent and devoted staff who are always willing to place their time and knowledge at the disposal of the visiting scholar , with a personal helpfulness and courtesy that will surprise those with purely Western experience . These records are open to all who can read them . " n13 The late Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of California , Los Angeles , also spoke highly of the helpfulness of the archivists. n14 He argued that the sheer amount of new material available removed any excuse for any scholar investigating various nationalist revolts not to spend time examining the new sources. ( n15 ) <p> Even Taner Akam of University of Minnesota , one of the most vocal proponents of Armenian genocide claims , noted the improvement in the working conditions of the archives . In a recent article , he thanked the staff and especially the deputy director-general of state archives for their help and openness during his last visit. n16 The archivists are now helpful to all researchers , not only those pursuing research which supports the Turkish government 's line . <p> L : TURKISH MILITARY ARCHIVES The archives of the Turkish General Staff Military History and Strategic Studies Directorate in Ankara ( Trkiye Cumhuriyeti Genelkurmay Askeri Tarih ve Stratejik Ett Baskanlig i Arsivleri ) provide a military perspective . Indeed , more than the Ottoman Archives in the Prime Minister 's Office , this repository provides a rich trove of information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , and the Special Organization ( Teskilat-i Mahsusa ) , somewhat equivalent to the Ottoman special forces , for the period 1914-22. ( n17 ) <p> The World War I and War of Independence archives alone number over five and a half million documents spread among Turkish General Staff Division reports and War Ministry files . Division 1 ( Operations ) contains military operations plans and orders , operations and situation reports , maps and overlays , general staff orders , mobilization instructions and orders , organizational orders , training and exercise instructions , spot combat reports . Division 2 ( Intelligence ) contains intelligence estimates and reports and orders of battle . Divisions 3 and 4 ( Logistics ) contain files concerning procurement , animals , munitions , transportation , rations , and accounting . The Ministry of War files contain the General Command 's ciphered cables to military units as well as the papers of the infantry , fortress artillery , and other divisions . Vehip Pasha 's Third Army ( Erzurum ) , Jemal Pasha 's Fourth Army ( Damascus ) , and Ali Ihsan Pasha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files . These also include the Lightning Armies and Caucasian Armies groups. ( n18 ) <p> The cataloging and microfilming of the military archives repository up to the end of 1922 is complete . Once-secret documents should provide new information on the Armenian issue. n19 In addition to the microfilmed documents , the Turkish General Staff Military History and Strategic Studies Directorate publishes volumes of documents from its collection , including Latin alphabet transliteration of all documents. ( n20 ) <p> Justin McCarthy , professor of Middle Eastern history and demographer at the University of Louisville/Kentucky , one of the few Western scholars to have done systematic research in the Ottoman archives , has written that the " reports of Ottoman soldiers and officials were not political documents or public relations exercises . They were secret internal reports in which responsible men relayed to their governments what they believed to be true . " n21 Indeed , the military records have already called into question conventional wisdom about the Special Organization , namely , the organization 's involvement in the Armenian relocations. ( n22 ) <p> L : OTHER ANKARA RESOURCES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ankara is also open to the public . The society houses private collections relating to strategy and political matters in the twentieth century , which include the papers of World War I-era war minister Enver Pasha together with those of his chief aide-de-camp and brother-in-law , Kazim Orbay . The Enver Pasha collection , donated in 1972 by his daughter Mahpeyker Enver , consists of 789 single , disparate items of handwritten notes , memoranda , reports , military records , cards and invitations , dispatches , letters of appreciation of colleagues and opponents , photographic albums , topographic maps , charts , private correspondence , diaries , and miscellany for the period 1914-22 . There are no restrictions on access to these. n23 Because in the early decades of the twentieth century it was customary for officials to keep their papers upon their departure , these remain a relatively rare resource . Orbay 's papers add additional insight because they enable historians to gauge which issues most occupied the Ottoman Empire 's highest ranking military official of the time . Few scholars have used this last collection perhaps because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library ( Milli Ktphane ) at Ankara houses thousands of Muslim court records , most of which were transferred from local museums and offices scattered around Turkey . These records contain a vast array of information concerning imperial administration , city government , the affairs of townspeople and villagers and deal with almost every aspect of the lives of the subjects be it personal status , taxes , loans , sales , price regulations , complaints , flight , or theft . Any matter requiring official resolution , registration , verification , or adjudication was potentially the domain of the Muslim judge ( kadi ) even when the matters applied to non Muslims , such as Armenian Christians. n25 Many Turkish historians have employed Muslim court records extensively for Anatolian regional studies , but they remain relatively untapped by Armenian historians. ( n26 ) <p> L : ARMENIAN ARCHIVES Sole reference to Ottoman archives will not and should not satisfy historians ; a full study of the Armenians during World War I should consider material from all sides in a conflict . The Armenian community maintains a number of archives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dashnak Party ( Dashnaksutiun , the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ) and the First Republic of Armenia . Both of the above together with the archives of the Armenian patriarchate in Jerusalem and the Catholicosate , the seat of the supreme religious leader of the Armenian people , in Echmiadzin , Armenia , remain closed to non-Armenian researchers . Tatul Sonentz-Papazian , Dashnakist archivist , for example , denied Inn University scholar Gknur Akgadag access to the Watertown archives in a June 20 , 2008 letter . Dashnaksutiun archives are also not available to those Armenians who do not tow the party line . Historian Ara Sarafian , director of the Gomidas Institute in London , complained that " some Armenian archives in the diaspora are not open to researchers for a variety of reasons . The most important ones are the Jerusalem Patriarchate archives . I have tried to access them twice and been turned away . The other archives are the Zoryan Institute archives , composed of the private papers of Armenian survivors , whose families deposited their records with the Zoryan Institute in the 1980s . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accessible to scholars . " n27 Beyond the closure of Armenian archives to non-Armenian and even to some Armenian scholars , few of these allow the public to access catalogs detailing their holdings . <p> Many scholars writing on the Armenian question utilize Britain 's National Archives ( formerly the Public Record Office ) in Kew Gardens . While the British government has made available many of their diplomats ' reports for study , much material from the British occupation of Istanbul ( 1919-22 ) and elsewhere in Anatolia following World War I remains closed to researchers under the Official Secrets Act and are only partially available in the archives of the government of India in Delhi . British authorities say they remain sealed for national security reasons . Their release should be important to historians as they will include evidence regarding returning Armenian refugees and other related matters . Files of the British Eastern Mediterranean Special Intelligence Bureau also remain closed , perhaps because the British government does not wish to expose those who may have committed espionage on behalf of Britain . These are important because they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda , and attempts to provoke treason and desertion from Ottoman ranks during and immediately after 1914-18 . The documents of the Secret Office of War Propaganda , which under the direction of Lord James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee developed propaganda used against the Central Powers during World War I , also remain sealed . Their opening will allow historians to assess whether British officials in the heat of war created or exaggerated accounts of deliberate atrocities . <p> L : AN INTERNATIONAL HISTORIANS ' COMMISSION History can not be decided by politicians weighing either constituent concerns or emotions more than evidence . Nor should the debate on history be closed while the existing narrative utilizes only a small portion of the source material . The same holds true not only for Armenian historians but also for their Turkish counterparts and others . <p> Rather , historians should work together to consider all source material , both in Armenian and Turkish archives . Each should be open fully . Cherry-picking documents to " prove " preconceived ideas and to ignore documents that undercut theses is poor history and , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On April 10 , 2005 , Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan extended an invitation to Armenian president Robert Kocharian to establish a joint commission consisting of historians and other experts to study the developments and events of 1915 , not only in the archives of Turkey and Armenia but also in those of relevant third countries such as Russia , Britain , France , Germany , Austria-Hungary , and the United States , and to share their findings with the public. n28 Ninety-seven members of the Council of Europe 's Parliamentary Assembly at Strasbourg signed a declaration calling on Armenia to accept the Turkish proposal. n29 In his annual commemoration message to the Armenian-American community in 2005 , President George W. Bush expressed support for Turkey 's proposal , declaring , " We look to a future of freedom , peace , and prosperity in Armenia and Turkey and hope that Prime Minister Erdogan 's recent proposal for a joint Turkish-Armenian commission can help advance these processes . " n30 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated the point two years later , telling Congress , <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look from historians . And what we 've encouraged the Turks and the Armenians to do is to have joint historical commissions that can look at this , to have efforts to examine their past , and in examining their past to get over their past. ( n31 ) <p> It is unfortunate that the Armenian government has failed to accept the joint commission , for without joint consideration of all evidence , the wounds of the past will not heal and , indeed , when an incomplete narrative enters the political realm , the consequences can be grave . <p> L : Footnotes  --  ( n1 ) See , for example , Vahakn N.
