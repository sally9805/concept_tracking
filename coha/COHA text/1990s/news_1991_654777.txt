<p> THE Breytenbach family has everything going for it - except peace of mind about what lies ahead . <p> " The most important thing in life is security about the future , " says Friedrich Breytenbach , an energetic man with a glint in his eye . " You must know that what you are doing will not be destroyed . " <p> How to guarantee continuity in a changing South Africa is something that Mr. Breytenbach thinks about more and more . His doubts have intensified since President Frederik de Klerk signaled his willingness nearly a year ago to negotiate a political settlement with the black majority . <p> Those doubts have been intensified by Mr. De Klerk 's moves to scrap the cornerstones of apartheid . " I disagree strongly with what De Klerk is doing . It is not what a true nationalist would do . " <p> Breytenbach is not about to despair , but the certainty he once had about the future of Afrikaners as the dominant " tribe " in South Africa has given way to nagging doubt . <p> Changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Breytenbachs could have lived in relative isolation from the country 's racial problems . Today , changes are creating ripples that reach even to rural backwaters like Zeerust . <p> Breytenbach , and his wife Margaretha , are Afrikaners whose European origins have been submerged by more than a century in the harsh African environment . <p> His ancestors came from the town of Holle in Germany four generations ago and settled in the Boer republic of Transvaal - now one of the four provinces of South Africa . Like most Afrikaners , Margaretha 's ancestors were of Dutch origin . They established themselves as farmers in the area where the Breytenbachs now live . <p> Some of the paradoxes that distort Breytenbach 's once clear-cut world emanate from his own family . <p> His wife Margaretha has a flourishing legal practice in town , in addition to managing a family of four children ranging in age from eight to 17 years . For the past year , or so , Mrs. Breytenbach has been playing the unlikely role of a civil rights lawyer for black activists who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as just another job , " she says . " It did give me an insight , but it did not change my political views . " <p> This apparent paradox is partly explained by the fact that Mrs. Breytenbach is less forthcoming than her husband about her political views . They appear to be more open than his , but she was reluctant to acknowledge the differences publicly . <p> Breytenbach seemed to be least comfortable when defending hard-line apartheid and seemed to be moving - in his own mind - toward the principle of free association . <p> His doubts have provided fertile ground for the younger generation of Breytenbachs . <p> A year ago , 17-year-old Mariette Breytenbach was totally opposed to the idea of racial mixing and counted herself lucky that she went to an all-white school . Then , with her father 's encouragement , she went on a six-week exchange program last year to live with a family in Germany . <p> In Germany , she had her first social contact with black people of her age . They got along very well , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariette . <p> When she returned to South Africa , she asked to be transferred to a multiracial school where instruction is carried on in German . Today Mariette 's best friend is Rosemary Boulton , a girl of mixed-race who shares her school hostel . <p> " They ( the black girls ) were the ones who were friendly and made me feel welcome , " she says . " In a small town , you never make contact with other races , " says Mariette in a joint interview with her friend Rosemary at the German school in Pretoria . <p> " The blacks there are different , " she says , glancing awkwardly at Rosemary . Then the two girls exchange a reassuring smile . " Here they are very nice , " says Mariette , slightly embarrassed . <p> Changes across generations <p> Breytenbach did not seem in any way concerned by the broadening of his daughter 's horizons . This seems slightly less puzzling if one looks at the changes that have taken place over three generations of Breytenbachs . <p> Breytenbach 's views are enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes no attempt to conceal his racist stand and sees De Klerk 's policies as part of a CIA conspiracy . <p> Breytenbach takes a somewhat less strident position , siding with the right-wing forces intent on thwarting black rule and ensuring the survival of the Afrikaner . He seeks his future security , at least in part , in the concept of a sovereign " white homeland " where Afrikaners will be able to live and work without the possibility of black rule . <p> But here , too , Breytenbach has reservations . A move to an undeveloped expanse of semidesert would entail enormous sacrifice . " Whether or not I go to the white homeland depends on what happens here , " he says . <p> The scrapping of apartheid laws has left Zeerust - a small town about 200 miles west of Johannesburg - almost unchanged for the white inhabitants . Blacks , who live in a segregated township , do not venture into the town 's library or swimming pool , and schools are still rigidly segregated . <p> " The way of life here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it changing in the medium to long term , " he says . <p> Five miles east of Zeerust , Breytenbach runs a small whites-only hotel known as Abjaterskop , a local landmark featured in the stories of South African raconteur Herman Charles Bosman . <p> A successful businessman , local politician , and farmer , Breytenbach has worked hard to achieve his position of prosperity and prominence in the conservative community . <p> Breytenbach 's day starts at 6 a.m . Most of the morning is spent on the farm checking on his cattle and construction work under way in the town . The afternoon sometimes means business in town , where he is chairman of the town council 's management committee . <p> Church takes stand <p> One of the most talked about topics in Zeerust today is the recent decision of the Dutch Reformed Church , the main Afrikaner church , to apologize for the sins of apartheid . That the church moderator chose to make the " confession " at a multiracial church conference , in response to a call from Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept . <p> " This is begging forgiveness from the wrong person , " he says . " If you are going to confess , you must confess to God . <p> " I really do n't believe that all our great theologians could have been wrong . ... In any case , you can find many verses in the Bible to prove that separation is justified . " <p> It is after statements like these that Breytenbach appears most uncomfortable . He left the Dutch Reformed Church several years ago , when it began to withdraw its theological justification for apartheid . Today he is a member of the Afrikaner Protestant Church , a right-wing splinter group of the church . " That is where I feel more at home , " he says . <p> Breytenbach has encouraged his children to learn German - the language of their ancestors - because he sees it as an insurance policy if whites lose their position of privilege . <p> " As I see the future of South Africa - with the rise of black power - you have to either speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or German , " he says , in a candid assessment of the future . " You either stay here or you go back to Europe . "
