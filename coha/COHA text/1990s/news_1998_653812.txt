<p> The moment William L. Larson heard the hesitant voice of his investment banker on the telephone , he knew something had gone awry . Cheyenne Software , a company he had been negotiating to buy for several months , had spurned his advances and was treating his $1 billion stock offer as a hostile takeover attempt . <p> Mr. Larson was no amateur . He had snapped up four companies in less than three years for the fledgling software empire he ran . But Cheyenne was supposed to be the big catch . " You have to hold a press conference and respond , " Mr. Larson 's banker told him . <p> In the weeks that followed in the spring 1996 battle , Mr. Larson urged Cheyenne 's chief executive to let an independent committee consider the offer . Cheyenne , in turn , accused him of trying to " poison the minds " of its shareholders . Realizing he could n't win without paying too high a price , Mr. Larson withdrew his bid . Months later , his archrival , Computer Associates , bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the one that got away , " Mr. Larson , 42 , said recently over lunch in his office in Santa Clara , Calif . <p> Not many other catches have eluded his grasp since then . He has continued buying and has transformed his company , Network Associates  --  which was previously named McAfee Associates  --  from a stodgy one-product shop into one of the largest independent software suppliers in the country , with a market value of more than $5.8 billion . From 1994 to 1997 , revenue quadrupled to $612 million , and the company 's stock price has multiplied 28-fold , to yesterday 's closing price of $41.625 a share . And though Network Associates is dwarfed by the likes of Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies , Mr. Larson is regarded as one of the most successful acquirers of technology companies today . <p> The Cheyenne fiasco taught him several important lessons , Mr. Larson said , particularly that you should never put an offer in writing unless you know the deal is done . " I 'm a quick learner , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As chairman and chief executive , his guiding principle is to hang onto the core asset of the acquired company  --  the brainpower of its employees  --  at all costs . That strategy requires precision planning , involving everything from putting Network Associates T-shirts on new employees ' chairs to calling favored executives to keep them from bolting to the competition . <p> To strengthen the talent pool , Mr. Larson also wields a carrot and a stick . The stick is a blunt warning to newcomers to get results or go elsewhere . The carrot is stock options  --  largess that he estimates has already made more than 200 millionaires among his staff of about 1,700 . <p> Mr. Larson wants to be the dominant seller of software that helps companies protect their computers from hackers and viruses as well as manage their computer networks better . And he is well on his way : his company has absorbed 12 companies in the last four and a half years , ranging from the acquisition last week of a British anti-virus software maker , Dr. Solomon 's Group P.L.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition in 1997 of the Network General Corporation , a network-management company . <p> Pursuing growth through acquisitions , a daunting task in any industry , is an even greater challenge in a business where the key to success or failure walks out the door each night . But Mr. Larson has consistently exceeded Wall Street 's expectations . <p> Most people figured the takeover of Network General would put the brakes on the company 's earnings growth , which had averaged 40 percent a year since Mr. Larson joined the company . Instead , in the quarter that ended on March 31  --  the first since the deal was completed  --  earnings surged 14 percent over the previous three-month period , higher than analysts had expected . Revenue rose 9 percent , to $188.4 million . That figure was 3 percent higher than analysts ' estimates of what the two concerns would have generated had they remained independent . <p> Earlier acquisitions are also paying off . Between 1994 and 1996 , Mr. Larson paid $44 million for four small companies that have become the mainstay of Network Associates ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as $75 million in revenue last year and will contribute $100 million this year . <p> " This is not an accounting game , " said Michael Murphy , editor of the California Technology Stock Letter . " He is acquiring pieces of a product portfolio that get him taken more and more seriously . " <p> The question is whether Mr. Larson can continue his winning streak . After all , the market for anti-virus products is maturing , giving short- sellers a reason to bet against his stock . In addition , as his company grows , it will be harder to compete with cash-rich giants like the Microsoft Corporation for acquisitions to complement his one-stop-shopping concept . <p> Mr. Larson brushes off the skeptics with his usual swagger . " We do n't lack for a direction , " he said . " What might be unclear is the destination . " <p> Besides , he said , gazing out his window at Silicon Valley below , " If you swim with the sharks , you have to learn to bite back . " <p> When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . He picks up his sandwich and puts it down without a bite . He tugs at the shoulder of his too-snug shirt . He laughs heartily , but with a nervous edge . <p> That is n't surprising . " The most dangerous point where you are most at risk during a transaction is post-announcement and prior to closing , " he said . " There is a significant amount of work that goes on in the first three to six months when people are being tested . " <p> That is why Mr. Larson has an integration plan ready the day an acquisition is announced , unlike many companies that keep people in the dark for weeks . First , Network Associates and the target company move quickly to reassure their employees by sending them , via E-mail , the news release announcing the takeover , along with a copy of a joint letter by the two chief executives and a presentation touting the new partnership . <p> Mr. Larson also sets up four to six " tiger teams " led by top-level executives from both companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a stampede out the door , he keeps a crucial " keepers " list of employees that he or another highly placed executive will personally ask to stay . " Executive recruiters divebomb your firm , " he complained . " And the best people leave first . " <p> When Network Associates acquired Network General last year , Mr. Larson made several presentations , including one to 800 people in a Santa Clara theme park that was broadcast to 10 other cities . " If you 're scared , that 's human , " Mr. Larson said he told employees then . " We are taking you out of your comfort zone . " <p> Which is exactly where he wants them . He lets employees know he wo n't tolerate " dead weight . " " Just show me the money , " Mr. Larson told sales representatives after acquiring Network General . <p> In fact , no job is exempt , he says . " Like , you know , public relations , " he whispered as his publicity director stepped out of the room . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more dismissive of rivals  --  a trait that has earned him a fair share of critics . For years , he has sparred with Gordon E. Eubanks Jr. , chief executive of the Symantec Corporation , a software maker and competitor , whose company sued Network Associates in 1997 , accusing it of selling software to customers that contained stolen computer code . ( The suit is pending . ) Mr. Larson responded with a $1 billion defamation suit that was later dropped . <p> " He goes out of his way to explain why competitors are dumbbells , " said Mr. Murphy of the California Technology Stock Letter . " There are people in the Valley who 'd like to see him take a header just to give him a little humility . " <p> Still , while supporters and critics agree that he can be a brash self-promoter , they say he is also a first-rate strategist . " He 's not for everybody and everybody 's not for him , " said Edward J. Zander , the chief operating officer of Sun Microsystems , who hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " He 's an aggressive guy who says his piece . " <p> A native of Massachusetts , Mr. Larson started in business as a consultant at Bain &; Company , the management consulting company in Boston . A graduate of Stanford Law School , he cut his teeth at Apple Computer and Sun , where he held senior sales and marketing jobs and learned how important it was to manage Wall Street 's expectations . <p> He is not your typical chief executive . He listens to Generation X bands like Smashing Pumpkins and Third Eye Blind , eschewing older singers like Billy Joel . And he sometimes wears a pair of Batman cuff links to meetings , a gift from his son . Why ? " Because I 'm Batman ! " he said he once told a stock analyst . <p> In truth , he is " obsessed with Network being a multibillion-dollar company , " said Charles Phillips , an enterprise software analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . When Mr. Larson went shopping for a new banker after the Cheyenne incident , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revered analyst willing to pay attention to his company . Morgan Stanley , one of the premier investment banks involved in technology mergers and acquisitions , delivered on both counts . <p> Since he hired Morgan Stanley , few opportunities have slipped by . Mr. Larson took two earlier passes at Dr. Solomon before the company agreed to be bought last week . And when it seemed another bidder was about to win Trusted Information Systems , a maker of software to protect companies from Internet hackers based in Glenwood , Md. , he fought back with all his weapons . <p> Mr. Larson first invited Stephen T. Walker , chief executive of Trusted Information Systems , to dinner at the Park Avenue Cafe in New York last December to propose a combination . The executives discussed the prospects over the next two months , flying to each other 's headquarters , and set up what was supposed to be a final meeting on a Friday in February to discuss price . <p> But on the morning of the appointment , Mr. Larson got a call from a representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platinum Technology , a competitor , had entered a bid and was expected to win , he said he was told . <p> Mr. Larson had other ideas . And he acted fast . After meeting with his bankers , he called Mr. Walker that afternoon and said he was willing to consider a stock exchange worth about $20 a share , well above Platinum 's bid of $15 a share . " That 's fine , " Mr. Larson said Mr. Walker replied . " Are you offering that or not ? " <p> " Yes , " Mr. Larson said . " I 'm getting on an airplane to come and see you . " <p> Within hours , he and his negotiating team were in Washington . On Saturday , they closed a $303 million stock deal with Mr. Walker . It was approved by both boards the next day . <p> Mr. Larson displays contradictory emotions about his future . He worries about who will succeed him , but quickly adds that he has no plans to leave . He suggests that he is the driving force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strong as his team . " A lot of this is force of sheer will , and stuff happens , " he said . " I should be able to get hit by a truck and not have the stock go down 20 points . " <p> The irony is that many in the industry wonder when the tables will be turned on Network Associates . " The one question I get is who is going to buy him , " said John Powers , an analyst at BankAmerica Robertson Stephens . <p> Mr. Larson laughed at that thought . And for a brief moment , he had nothing to say . <p> Chart : " Becoming a Big Fish in a Crowded Pond " Since William L. Larson , right , has been in charge of the company now known as Network Associates , it has gone on an impressive shopping spree . With a dozen acquisitions in his wake , he is both envied and feared in a hotly contested sector of the software business . Brightwork Development The company , then called McAfee , paid $10.7 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network management tools . It helped the company take the lead in antivirus software . VYCOR McAfee paid $9 million in March 1996 to acquire Vycor , a fast-growing maker of software for technology-support desks based in College Park , Md . The deal enabled the company to offer two complementary products under one umbrella . Network General After a $1.3 billion deal in January 1997 with Network General , a network management concern , the company became Network Associates . The deal created one of the largest makers of network security and management software and a powerful independent software company . Dr. Solomon 's Group After two previous attempts to acquire Dr. Solomon 's Group , a British antivirus software maker , Network Associates finally reached a deal last week in which it agreed to pay $642 million in stock . The deal is still subject to review by regulators in Europe .
