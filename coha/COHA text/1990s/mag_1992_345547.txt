Robert Venturi , the man who launched architectural Postmodernism a quarter- century ago , is not exactly unsung : only a few of his living peers are better known , and none has been credited with more deeply influencing the way houses and cityscapes look . Still , Venturi and Denise Scott Brown , his wife and partner , feel chronically underappreciated . They have never got as much work as they might have : after almost 40 years as architects , much of that time as world-famous architects , Venturi and Scott Brown have built a few score buildings , many of those within driving distance of their office and none of them very large . Spring after spring , the Pritzker Architecture Prize , a 13-year-old pseudo Nobel , went to other people , sometimes Venturi 's inferiors . <P> Now , at age 66 , comes vindication  --  kudos , prestigious buildings , the works . Last April , Venturi won the Pritzker . In July his impeccable addition to the National Gallery of Art on Trafalgar Square in London was dedicated . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's fetching new art museum . <P> Is he finally happy ? Almost . " You always look at what you have done and say , ' Oh , I could have done that better . ' " But , he agrees , it 's a pretty nice museum , particularly given its hemmed-in , heart-of-downtown site . " It is a little building with big scale , " Venturi said on the eve of the grand opening , " surrounded by big buildings with little scale . " <P> That sounds familiar  --  and , sure enough , he used it in his seminal book , Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture , to describe one of his early buildings . Complexity and Contradiction was a galvanizing manifesto , liberating architects from Modernist , minimalist dogma . " Less is a bore , " Venturi declared , meaning that it was time to begin using ornament in buildings again . And also , " Main Street is almost all right , " meaning that familiar , off-the-shelf architectural forms also deserved to be revived . The past could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venturi told his snobbish profession , and enjoy the old-fashioned gewgaws , the color , even the kitsch . <P> This is now conventional wisdom , but in the early ' 60s it was crazy talk , downright revolutionary , particularly coming from a respected young Princeton graduate and Rome Prize winner . By the time his book was published in 1966 , Venturi had actually built a house illustrating his alarming , thrilling ideas in a Philadelphia suburb , for the perfect client : his well-to-do socialist mother . As with much of his work since , he took the debased , muddled classical references residually present in most suburban houses and made them self- conscious , explicit , arch . The house was two decades ahead of its time . Imagine a Pop artwork from 1945 , or a rap recording from 1965 . <P> Amazing  --  and not always , at the time , likable . His 1973 addition to Oberlin College 's art museum has a checkerboard exterior and a comically oversize Ionic column inside . Outrageous ! The molecular-biology lab at Princeton , designed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly orientalized archways . Ridiculous !
