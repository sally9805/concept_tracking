The new capitalists  --  those who started trading during this great , four-year , 20%-plus S &P; bonanza  --  may have stumbled on a bit of knowledge we old-timers ca n't seem to get into our heads . They regard bonds as risky , stocks as safe . Nothing could be more wealth-creating than those Gibraltars , the Net stocks , and nothing more dangerous than that 30-year piece of paper issued by that barely credit-worthy entity , the United States of America . <P> This credo is at the heart of what scares traditionalists about the market and entices the newer generation . I was schooled at Goldman Sachs  --  could it be just 15 years ago ?  --  that nothing could be safer , and have less risk , than U.S. Treasuries . They set the safety benchmark against which you could measure everything else , and when I got in the business , that benchmark was a hefty 14% . That return , backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam , was simply too competitive to even consider equities . Stocks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only game in town . Imagine . <P> But something happened to the risk perception of these two competing instruments : they switched . Bonds ceased to yield double digits and then even high single digits . At the same time , huge budget deficits , now seemingly a thing of the past , created an impression that the guarantee of repayment was really more of a touchy-feely promise rather than a bond etched in stone . <P> Stocks , however , particularly name-brand stocks , have taken on the aura of a high-interest annuity , to the point that " conservative " moneymen like Warren Buffett bank on stocks with 30 and 40 price-to-earnings multiples , like Disney and Coke and Gillette . Being fully invested , once the province only of the biggest bozos and wild-eyed optimists , now seems to be the duty of every red-blooded American , no matter what age or income bracket . Even more amazing , there is a whole new class of equity holders that regards regard Buffet 's buy-and-hold strategy as boring  --  too safe . <P> These newbies , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Yahoo , think the danger lies in sitting out these moves in the Pepsis and Mercks . And who is to blame them ? Lately I have come to wonder whether the risk-reward parameters I cut my teeth on are as out of date as those of my parents ' generation , which saw utilities as safe , conservative growth vehicles that would leave hefty rewards for their children . They did n't . At what point , after how many new fortunes , can we proclaim the old paradigm of stock risk and bond reward as dead as the **38;7734;TOOLONG theory ? Judging by the feisty performance of the creaky old Dow , not to mention the rockin ' nasdaq , should n't we call the financial-risk coroner come the millennium ? <P> Over my dead bonds . Call me old fashioned , but after four years of hypergrowth , the likelihood that the S &P; can keep up that performance becomes less , not more . You flip a coin four times , and it comes up heads ; you can not conclude that the next flip will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming , it does n't mean there is no risk of a tail  --  or a tailspin  --  eventually . I 'd be more comfortable if we got to a 10,000 Dow over a longer period of time , during which earnings could catch up to prices . Probabilities have a nasty habit of reasserting themselves when you are most inured to their risk .
