<p> LISTENING TO OTHERS <p> Successful lives for those who are deaf <p> The Listen Foundation is a laudable group . In his ' Group funds hearing help for kids ' ( Nov. 14 ) story , the writer says : ' If hearing-impaired kids can be taught to listen and speak , they can live fulfilling , happy lives . They can go to school alongside children who have good hearing . They can play in their own neighborhoods , attend birthday parties , and ride bikes . ' <p> Anyone reading this canard gets the idea that unless we deaf folks ' listen and speak , ' we are unable to enjoy life 's simple pleasures - unable to : live in the ' hood and have careers ; attend school , parties , meetings , movies , theaters ; ride bikes , buses , trains , planes , cruise ships ; drive cars and pilot aircraft . In short , we 're unable to go places and ' live fulfilling , happy lives ' alongside those with ' good hearing . ' <p> This goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated often enough and long enough , and not challenged , becomes a ' fact . ' <p> The problem lies in listening to those who are not themselves deaf , who have n't a clue about what it means to be deaf and positive about it , who purport to speak about deafness and its perceived negatives to parents of deaf kids . There is an active , vibrant ' of the deaf ' community about which such ' for the deaf ' mouthpieces are very careful not to mention . <p> ( Why , we must n't let this community apply for grants and divert funds from groups that prefer to ignore its existence . Such groups exist only because there are deaf kids - kids who must not be allowed to be deaf . ) <p> As a born-deaf person of deaf parents ( signing with my hands and actually able to speak - wow ! - with my mouth , but hearing only with my eyes and listening with - and speaking - my mind ) , let me assure readers of this fact : Deaf people ( just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with ' good hearing ' ) do lead happy , fulfilling , successful lives . <p> DAVID A. ANTHONY <p> Boulder <p> HE 'S BACK HARRY POTTER <p> Really funny books <p> We know the reasons that some people do n't want kids to read Harry Potter . Some people : <p> Do n't want kids to get bad ideas like disobeying adults and people taking over other people 's minds . Well , Pinocchio does n't obey his father and that 's not banned . Do n't want kids to read about violence like sticking magic wands up people 's noses or killing unicorns to drink their blood . In Jack and the Beanstalk , Jack pokes a stick into the giant 's eye . It is n't banned . <p> Do n't believe in witches , wizards , flying brooms , trolls and etc . How about Snow White and the Sorcerer 's Apprentice with all their magical people . <p> All of these things do happen in the Harry Potter books but our argument is these books should n't be banned because they are really funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids and their parents . They can share the ideas with each other because adults like these books the same as kids . <p> SHAD ALLEN , 8 <p> CLINTON LOVISONE , 8 <p> Federal Heights <p> Narnia series titles <p> I can fully understand why some Christian parents might object to their children reading the Harry Potter books , which evidently deal with the subject of magic and witchcraft . A spokesperson for Focus on the Family has recommended that ' The Chronicles of Narnia ' be substituted for the Potter books because they teach the same positive lessons , but from a Christian viewpoint . What is truly amusing about this suggestion is that two of the books in the Narnia series are titled , ' The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ' and ' The Magician 's Nephew . ' <p> KERRY HYDE <p> Denver <p> Allowed reading <p> Re : ' The wand of censorship , ' Nov. 11 editorial . <p> The Post said that it is pathetic that two Douglas County schools wo n't allow teachers to read Potter books to students ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of mysticism creeping into their children 's lives . ' <p> It 's almost as pathetic as the ruling that these same teachers are n't allowed to read God 's book to their students simply because some non-Christian parents apparently are scared silly about a touch of truth creeping into their children 's lives . <p> PATRICK McCANN <p> Aurora <p> Other scary stories <p> I do n't know much about the Harry Potter books , but they sound fairly harmless to me . I remember ' Hansel and Gretel , ' with the evil witch about to cook up the children . Or how about the ' Legend of Sleepy Hollow , ' with the headless horseman . Where were those nasty Christians when I needed them ! <p> But wait - the wand of censorship is n't just waved by Christians , as you imply . There is a more insidious and blatant kind of censorship which has overwhelmed the public school . The wand is waved principally by the ACLU and other anti-Christian groups . <p> FRANK BUFFINGTON <p> Gunnison <p> Literary devices <p> There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Potter-banning nonsense , when The Post went and said everything I had wanted to say . <p> My son is good reader ; he just does n't choose to spend much time doing it . I have never seen a child devour three books as quickly as he did these . I pay close attention to what my children watch and read . The wizardry and magic in the Potter books are literary devices . It is such a shame that Christian groups can so easily toss out the good lessons found in the books just because of a weak , imagined connection to Satan . There are Christian parents who are thrilled to hear their child laughing out loud while reading a book , and who are n't knee-jerk afraid of a little ' magic ' in their child 's life . <p> CAMILLA MITCHELL <p> Colorado Springs <p> For adults , too <p> I am in fifth grade at Pioneer Elementary in Parker and was informed recently that the Harry Potter books are now banned from my school . I personally have read all three in the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released . I would like to know if all of the adults who are upset about these books have even read them . <p> A lot of references have been made about these books containing stuff about the devil or Satan . Nowhere in the Potter books does it contain any information about either of these subjects . Harry Potter is a fairy tale and everyone needs to remember that ! KELSIE MARKLIN , 10 <p> Parker <p> ' Dumbing down ' <p> I was upset to see that the Harry Potter books were pulled from Pine Lane and Trailblazer schools . Talk about censorship . It 's just this kind of pressure from parents that has led to the ' dumbing down ' of our schools . <p> Obviously the religiously inclined do n't understand what an allegory is , which is n't too surprising considering their dogged adherence to a theory of creation that has long since been disproved by science . If we are going to censor books because they do n't agree with the ' Christian ' point of view , then we might as well forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Aurora <p> Editor 's note : Contrary to earlier reports , Douglas County schools did n't ban teachers from reading the books aloud in classrooms . <p> HEAD HOMELESS IN COLORADO <p> Positive influence for kids <p> We are all painfully aware of the tragic , recent murders and beatings of homeless men in Denver . Yet in the midst of the stories about the murders and beatings and the homeless and street kids who have been arrested as suspects , we have missed another great tragedy : children living on the streets . These children are human beings who need care and love , not ' mall rats ' who need extermination . They are called ' mall rats ' because we prefer to label them as ' rats ' and consider them pests rather than acknowledge that they are people in need of our help . <p> It is true that homeless and street kids ' prefer ' to be on the streets - in the same way that you and I would prefer to be whipped five times instead of 20 times . They prefer to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically , and verbally abuse them , who neglect them , and/or who are addicted to drugs or alcohol . Many kids come from a foster-care system in which they have been moved around , some up to 15 times . All of them have troubled pasts . Life on the streets is hard - no kid really wants to live on the streets , even if he pretends to . According to the National Runaway Switchboard 42 percent prostitute themselves within 48 hours of being on the streets , 62 percent of these kids have tried to commit suicide at least once , and 14 street and homeless kids die on the streets in America each day . Most do drugs , and many are addicted , mostly to heroin nowadays . They are forced to sleep in abandoned buildings , in stairwells , under bridges and on the streets . The public hates them , pimps and drug pushers try to use them , the boys use the girls , the police are their enemies , and , yes , there is enmity among the homeless . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , almost no one . StandUp For Kids , a nonprofit organization committed to kids on the streets , goes to the streets - yes , to the 16th Street Mall - to help them . We are probably the only positive influence many of these kids have . We not only meet their physical needs on the streets by bringing them food , drink , clothing , and hygiene products , but we try to meet their emotional needs by befriending them , encouraging them to hope for and do good things and congratulating them when they do good things . Furthermore , we help these kids get off and stay off the streets . <p> ANDREW PARRIS <p> Executive Director <p> StandUp For Kids , Colorado <p> Denver <p> Day-to-day survival <p> If home is where the heart is , where is the heart of the homeless ? Or the near-homeless who know that their eviction notice is just a heartbeat away . <p> Did you know that an individual earning minimum wage must work 94 hours per week to afford the average two-bedroom apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Denver metro area on any given day ) are often stereotyped as standing on a street corner with a brown , cardboard sign . Granted , there are those who do that , but there are many who work , manage their meager income the best they can but still go to sleep at night knowing that the night sky might very well be the next roof over their heads . They might not be as visible , but they are there and they are us ! <p> There are two basic categories that these single people and families fall into . The first is the individual who gets up every morning to report to a temporary day labor facility in hopes of getting sent out on a job . If this is a lucky day he or she will work eight hours and receive cash wages averaging about $ 40 or $ 50 . This will cover a night 's stay in a not-so-nice motel with a few dollars left over for groceries or other necessities . If this is not a lucky day this person packs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are children involved , school becomes a precious and all-too-often unattainable luxury . Most of these people are not lazy . Some are even skilled . They are simply caught in a vicious circle that is virtually impossible to get out of unless they get some kind of help . They can never save to make a downpayment on an apartment . If they were to get a ' real job ' they would have to wait at least two weeks for a paycheck . And so survival becomes a day-to-day thing . For a few it becomes an accepted way of life ; for many it is not , but rather a living nightmare . <p> The second group is the working poor . They earn minimum wage or a bit better , and pay more than 45 percent of their income on housing . They are caught in the web of low wages and high rent . If an unexpected emergency takes some dollars from their already unbalanced budget they are in immediate trouble . If utility bills are not paid , they get shut off . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are agencies that do come to the rescue , but more often than not it is ' Band-Aid therapy . ' Most agencies can help only one time . These families are the near homeless and live in fear that their children will someday face the discomfort and humiliation of moving to the street and wo n't be able to give their teacher an address of where they live . <p> There needs to be a great awareness and understanding of this growing population . Remember , these folks have no safety net , no family support or friends that they can go to in a time of need . We need more transitional and Section 8 housing . Education , job training , family planning and counseling for long-term self-sufficiency would contribute to making to making it possible for these people to break out of a vicious and life-consuming cycle . Maybe they just need some kind of a miracle , too . <p> JOAN BETTS <p> Lakewood <p> Open up Civic Center Park <p> With the safety and lives of the homeless at such peril right now because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human decency to protect them ? <p> Why ca n't we open up Civic Center Park in Downtown after dusk and until dawn to allow these folks some element of protection ? I do n't mind my tax dollars going toward some additional police protection and park staff to keep the area clean during the daylight hours . I challenge the mayor , city council and whoever else makes these types of decisions to step out and do what is right . <p> Make this happen ! <p> VICKI TURNER <p> Denver <p> ON THE ROADS <p> Benefit to many <p> Re : ' I-25 gains to inflict pains ' Nov. 14 . <p> There is a fine alternative to ease the planned , painful expansion of the Valley Highway that is coming . Much money and disruption could be saved by installing the voter-approved light rail on an existing railroad right-of-way ( already owned by RTD ) running just to the south of I-25 along Buchtel Boulevard all the way from Broadway to Evans . This project could be done in a much shorter time frame , allowing motorists an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I-25 corridor . <p> This idea has been opposed by the ' not-in-my-neighborhood ' people who would profit by safe , quiet , well-fenced light rail adjacent to their neighborhoods . Though trains would have to run a little slower due to a few road crossings , light rail would provide convenience to these neighborhoods and the University of Denver . Those who think it would hurt neighborhood values should take a look at the great improvements the Five Points neighborhood has experienced since light rail arrived . When will Denverites realize that good , high-speed transportation enhances the value of neighborhoods ? It is interesting that some of the strongest foes who have fought against light rail along Buchtel have come to consider this right-of-way as an extension of their own yard . These people have insisted that RTD maintain it like neighborhood park . <p> The new light-rail line could be extended from Evans south along I-25 - to the great benefit of various business complexes ( most notably the Denver Tech Center ) . Then we 'd have a true test of light rail as to ridership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can provide an inherently faster , less expensive and safer option to the automobile . <p> RON VANDER KOOI <p> Arvada <p> Remember safety <p> I 'm astonished by the negative reporting about the widening of I-25 . <p> Attention is being given to entirely the wrong aspect of this vast project . The point , dear speed-conscious folks who terrorize us out there , is safety ! It 's a given that we need more lanes for speed and efficiency , but safety is the major goal of all of us , is it not ? <p> More and more of us are using less and less road space : one seems to exacerbate the other , does n't it ? With three lanes instead of two , and even four in dangerous spots like the Surrey Ridge area - one far to the right for trucks , thank Heaven - our safety is dramatically improved ! <p> So we will save only three minutes or some such - good grief ! The point is , we 'll stand a better chance of getting there alive and intact ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? <p> As a Castle Rock resident , I 'm eternally grateful for more lanes so that I can stay out of your way with a little more certainty of arriving alive . <p> CAROL A. HENRITZE <p> Castle Rock <p> SUV lane only <p> As anyone distantly in contact with reality knows , HOV lanes , Lexus lanes , and more lanes will never relieve the traffic congestion on I-25 . But one thing is clear : 1 out of 4 ( or more ) vehicles clogging the roads are SUVs , so the most obvious solution is an SUV lane . <p> The beauty of an SUV lane would be the billions saved in construction costs . Based on advertising images , these ' off-road ' SUVs do not need pavement or road grading or snow removal . Or speed limits . Their only requirement is a gas station every five miles , which involves zero public debt . <p> On television I see how easily SUVs bounce over mountains and plough through rivers . Maybe that 's why they roll over so often when forced onto those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set them free ! Over hill and dale , let the governor and the metro Denver army of suburban assault vehicle wannabe cowboy office workers have at it . <p> MARTIN KRETZMANN <p> Denver <p> Better use of C-470 <p> I have lived in the metro area since 1975 , and have experienced the slow growth of a parking lot on I-25 . <p> What amazes me is that the people responsible for managing growth ( i.e. the governor , state representatives , even congressional representatives and mayors of the metro-area communities ) have not coalesced to use C-470 as a way to reduce the through traffic on I-25 . <p> I realize C-470 is a toll road , but where there is a will there is a way for politicians to change any rule or law . Come on folks , let 's get a grass-roots effort to get C-470 completed around the metro area and open to traffic . <p> I would bet my common sense that this would help traffic congestion on the I-25 section though the metro area . <p> JOHN GENZIANO <p> Littleton <p> Which fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Qwest-US West on fast track , ' Nov. 12 . <p> Commenting Nov. 10 on the Qwest-US West merger , FCC Chairman William Kennard said , ' It 's fair to say that their application is on the fast track . ' However , this statement can be misunderstood , as there can be two time tracks - one for regulatory approval of the merger , the other for total merger synergies - dependent on which mega-telecom merger one is looking at . For example , while the Qwest-US West marriage may be approved in roughly half a year from when first announced , the total synergies wo n't come until Qwest-US West achieves approval to offer long-distance service in US West 's local service area . If that takes until , say , late 2001 , that 's almost two years for all synergies to kick in - not exactly fast track . <p> Meanwhile , while mergers like MCI WorldCom-Sprint or SBC-Ameritech may take much longer to gain approval , they can kick in synergies immediately upon approval ( i.e. selling Sprint 's wireless service to MCI-WorldCom customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mergers are really on the fast track ? <p> RICHARD S.
