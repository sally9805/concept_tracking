Section : Common Ground Reports from the World of Conservation <p> As inhospitable to human life as any place on earth , the Antarctic ( has drawn fortune-seekers , the driven , and the curious since its discovery in the early nineteenth century . The last major earthly region to be explored , the Antarctic has inspired a number of " firsts " : It is the first nuclear-free , military-free zone , the first territory dedicated to peace and science , the first ( and only ) one managed by international cooperation , where claims to ownership have been " frozen " by consentual agreement for some thirty years . <p> Isolated at the bottom of the world , Antarctica has nevertheless become a crucible of environmental research and debate , thanks in part to the discovery of the annual " ozone hole " that appears in the stratosphere above it . With the realization that not even Antarctica escapes air pollution , oil spills , and waste disposal problems has come increasing controversy over how best to preserve the region 's extraordinary wildlife and the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on the workings of the world . <p> Think of Antarctica and you will likely think of ice . Some 90 percent of the planet 's ice lies atop and around Antarctica , a continent of the size of the United States and Mexico combined . Drier than the Sahara Desert , the landmass stores up its snowflakes : 50 million years or so of light snowfall condensed into ice has built Antarctica into the world 's tallest continent . Ice sheets an average of 7,090 feet thick swathe about 98 percent of Antarctica , including entire mountain ranges . In some places the ice cap reaches a height more than twice that figure , or nearly three miles . The ice cover weighs enough to collapse the molecular structure of lower layers of ice in some places , creating lakes of super-cooled water near the bedrock . It weighs enough to push most of the Antarctic continent below sea level , enough to flatten the globe at the bottom of the world . <p> About 70 percent of the Earth 's fresh water is bound up in Antarctic ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could raise the sea-level approximately 60 meters . As you might expect , Antarctica is the coldest continent , with a mean annual temperature inland of - 70 degrees F , and it racked up the world 's record low of - 128.6 . It is the world 's windiest too : winds swirl clockwise around the land mass producing gusts of up to nearly 200 miles an hour . <p> And it is the wildest continent , the least trammeled by human progress and foible . Antarctica hosts the largest populations of wildlife left anywhere in the world . The flow of the surrounding southern oceans propels more nutrients from the bottom of the sea to the surface than in warm waters . Microscopic , sead-welling phytoplankton form the base of a food chain that links krill  --  a shrimplike creature that swarms in the hundreds of millions of tons  --  and its predators , which many of the 33 million seals , 500,000 whales , more than 100 million penguins and other seabirds . Human beings came relatively late , the first man  --  probably a seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Davis  --  may not have set foot on the continent until 1821 . By 1830 the fur seal population had just about died out , and it was nearly seventy years before a generation of adventurers ushered in the so-called heroic period of Antarctic exploration . Between 1898 and World War I , the land of ice witnessed more than a dozen major expeditions , an era highlighted by the legendary 1911 - 1912 race to the South Pole , the final two contestants being the Norwegian Roald Amundsen and the Englishman Robert E Scott . Amundsen 's well-organized team of five men and eighteen dogs won , but it was the romantic Scott , who died with his men in the attempt , who captured the world 's imagination . <p> After World War I , explorers came on wings , most of them from the United States . Admiral Richard E. Byrd , the best known , flew five expeditions between 1928 and 1958 , mapping and establishing the basis for claims to Antarctic land , had the nation chosen to exercise them . But the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union , it reserves the " right " to claim Antarctic territory at any time ( and maintains a station at the South Pole year-round while recognizing no other nation 's claim . There are more than a few of these . Beginning with Great Britain in 1908 , seven countries claimed slices of Antarctica during the first half of the twentieth century : Great Britain , Argentina , Chile , New Zealand , Australia , France , and Norway . Those of Great Britain , Argentina , and Chile overlap in the Antarctic Peninsula , closest point to a mainland ( Argentina , 650 miles ) . <p> Competition over claims was set aside during the International Geophysical Year ( IGY ) , an 18-month period in 1957 and 1958 . Timed to coincide with a period of intense sunspot activity , the IGY involved the cooperation of a dozen nations in Antarctic research , during which they established fifty research stations . So successful was the IGY in Antarctica that diplomats and scientists sought to prolong its spirit of cooperation . This they did by creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a diplomatic sleight of hand , the Antarctic Treaty neither supports nor denies any country 's claim on Antarctica , sidestepping the divisive question of who owns what , and turning the Antarctic into something of a global commons  --  a demilitarized , nuclear-free zone dedicated to the peaceful pursuit of knowledge and the free exchange of scientific information . Besides the claimant states , other original signers of the Treaty include South Africa , Belgium , Japan , the United States , and the Soviet Union . Any member country of the United Nations may join the treaty , although it must conduct serious research to become a voting party . Thirteen other countries have joined the original twelve as voting members of the Treaty ; another fourteen have become non-voting members . With the inclusion of India and China , more than three-quarters of the world 's population is represented as party to what is now called the Antarctic Treaty System ( ATS ) . <p> So far , under the mantle of the ATS , the land that maps long called " Terra Incognita " remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Antarctica attracts contemporary explorers  --  scientists , some 2,000 during its brief summer . About 200 remain during the winter . Astronomers brave winter at the South Pole because the Polar Plateau 's perpetual night offers a stunningly clear sky , virtually free of both water vapor and pollution , and the magnetic pole attracts a stream of cosmic rays . In summer , they can gaze 24 hours a day at the sun circling overhead , studying its " vibrations , " or solar eruptions . The edges of the continent have yielded more than half of all known meteorites  --  about 8,000 . Glacial ice moves them slowly towards the edges , where , pushed up against coastal mountains , they gradually rise to the surface and become exposed as the wind wears away the ice . Biologists study the organic " anti-freeze " that keeps Antarctic fish from freezing solid ithe 29 degrees farenheit Celsius waters around ice floes . Geologists survey the aptly named " dry valleys " of the interior , whose climate mat more closely mimic that of Mars than anywhere else on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fossils indicate that , 200 million years ago , Antarctica formed part of the supercontinent called Gondwanaland . <p> Antarctica is in the vanguard of research on climate change . The ominous ozone hole discovered over the region in the early 1980s has been growing . In the austral , or southern hemisphere , during the spring of 1989 , the mass of air containing as little as 50 percent of the normal complement of ozone swelled to twice the size of the continent . Ozone-depleted air allows more ultraviolet-radiation to reach the surface of the earth ; current research suggests that increased ultraviolet light may inhibit/photosynthesis in plants , including the microscopic phytoplankton that forms the base of the Antarctic food chain . The Antarctic may be more susceptible to ozone-destroying chemicals , including chloroflourocarbons , because ice crystals in the clouds provide surfaces where the implicated chemical reactions can take place . <p> The Antarctic is one of earth 's air conditioners . It remains frigid not only because of the oblique angle of the sun to the south pole but because the mass of white ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and much of the ocean surface . The frozen mass draws draws out of the Tropics , sending cold air and water north . And its cold ocean waters absorb tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide , a virtue that may mitigate the Greenhouse effect , but one that could be weakened in a vicious cycle if the oceans warm . Were large amounts of Antarctic sea-ice to melt , some reflectivity would also be lost , creating a multiplier effect for local warming . A change in the balance of polar and tropical temperatures could significantly disrupt the world 's climate and weather patterns . <p> Scientists value Antarctica 's relative lack of human presence for their work . But even they and their staff have taken a toll on the continent . In early 1987 the international environmentalist group , Greenpeace , founded the first permanent non-governmental base in the Antarctic . On inspection tours of more than twenty-five governmental bases , Greenpeace documented numerous problems . At McMurdo Station , for example , the largest American base , investigators discovered untreated sewage dumped into the sea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left exposed and rusting , and power generators operating without pollution controls . The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , which administers U.S. activities in the Antarctic , has recently mounted clean-up campaigns . The NSF plans to expand the programs , given passage of a congressional bill providing $30 million over the next five years for environmental protection and clean-up . <p> Recently , a new wave of explorers has created new challenges for those seeking to protect the frozen continent . As many as three thousand tourists now cruise to Antarctica every year during the short austral summer . Some leave behind litter , grafitti ; some cause stress to wildlife by strolling through penguin rookeries and other habitats . A number of private tour companies have generated a code of conduct for tourists , prohibiting harrassment of animals and taking of souvenirs . But environmental groups are pressing for tour operators to be licensed and regulated , with strict limits on numbers and frequency of tourists at wildlife sites . <p> ATS members have fortified the 1961 treaty over the years with an expanding network of agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one issue that ATS members originally thought they would never have to face  --  because of Antarctica 's ice cap and extreme climate  --  was minerals development . Technology , especially for offshore oil drilling , has grown steadily more sophisticated , however , and treaty parties  --  concerned that any claim to a minerals find could set off a rush to plunder the continent , and unravel the ATS  --  agreed in 1977 to abstain from minerals work while they grappled with a more formal way to deal with the prospect of drilling and mining . The result is now on the table , awaiting ratification by ATS members . Called the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities ( CRAMRA ) , or the Wellington Convention , after the New Zealand city in which it was adopted , the agreement would create institutions and rules to govern prospecting , exploration , and development of mineral deposits in the Antarctic . <p> CRAMRA has catapulted the frozen continent into the frontlines of global environmental debate . Advocates of CRAMRA argue that minerals development is inevitable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes profitable to exploit , and that scientists are bound to discover the continent 's bounty sooner or later . Prudence dictates erecting tough regulations no , they say , to guard against despoiling the environment  --  and the ATS  --  when minerals are developed in the future . CRAMRA provides those tough regulations , argue proponents , who in this country include the Bush Administration , the Office of Technology Assessment and some environmentalists . <p> But the bulk of the American environmental community , and many legislators , conclude diferently . " Minerals development is not inevitable , " says Representative Wayne Owens ( D-Utah ) . " The solution is simple : Do n't mine . Do n't drill . Do n't even begin . " By providing for ownership of resources and proprietary information , " CRAMRA sets up a legal structure for mining to take place , " says Susan Sabella , the Antarctica Campaigner for Greenpeace . " Our position is that 's wrong , " because of the fragility of the Antarctic environment , the inevitability of accidents and pollution , and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two percent of Antarctica that is not icecovered and is therefore already crowded with wildlife and scientists . " Mining in Antarctica will never be environmentally acceptable , " concurs Bruce Manheim , an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund . <p> With increasing conviction and support , conservationists and other ATS-party governments are calling for ATS members to scrap CRAMPRA , ban minerals prospecting and development altogether , and make Antarctica a permanent World Park . The World Park , or wilderness reserve , or global ecological commons- the idea has many names  --  would be dedicated to peace and science , as stated in the 1961 Treaty . But it also would feature tough , comprehensive provisions to protect the Antarctic environment from harm , whether by scientists , logistical operations , or tourism . <p> In opposition to CRAMRA , Manheim cites examples of the breaking  --  or severe bending  --  of ATS agreements by ATS parties , infractions that other members , in the interest of international harmony , countenanced with little or no effectual protest . The French bulldozed and dynamited penguin habitat and a breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harmfully interfere with wildlife . Chile built a hotel and airstrip that caused numerous penguins to abandon their nesting sites . The USSR and other countries have continued to net overexploited species of fish in the face of the convention prohibiting overfishing . The waters off our own McMurdo Base are more heavily polluted with PCBs and heavy metals than virtually any waterway in the United States , despite an anti-pollution agreement . If other ATS accords can be flouted with impunity , opponents argue , who can say that environmental provisions of CRAMPRA will hold fast ? <p> Then , too , recent accidents in both hemispheres have demonstrated that we still possess few antidotes to disaster . Antarctica has already suffered oil spills  --  four in the last year alone  --  from visiting ships . in January of 1989 , an Argentine supply vessel carrying fuel and tourists wrecked on the rocks near the United States ' small Palmer Station . The ship , the Bahia Paraiso remains submerged and continues leak oil . The spill virtually destroyed the local population of baby skuas  --  predatory shorebirds  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included scientific experiments , one of which had been accumulating data for/more than 20 years . Analyses point out that the spill  --  some 250,000 gallons  --  will probably wreak longer-laseing environmental damage than the much larger spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska , since natural recovery in colder waters takes longer . <p> So far , " Nobody has found anything  --  minerals or hydrocarbons  --  that could be classified as having any economic value today , " says Robert Rutford , president of the University of Texas at Dallas , who has studied Antarctica 's geology for more than two decades . But that 's not to say that the rock does not conceal treasures : while few imagine a gold rush-or oil rush-on the ice tomorrow , Antarctica likely harbors mineral endowments similar to those of other southern-hemisphere continents . <p> It is that possibility-however remote at this time-that moves many of CRAMRA 's supporters . They argue that while CRAMRA would in fact deter development , it provides rigid safeguards just in case . " The minerals agreement is not an agreement that activities place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Tuck head of the U.S. negotiating te agreement is essentially a ban that only be lifted with the consensus o twenty-five consultative parties . " Kimball of the World Resources Institute explains further : " The question is , what ' the best way to safeguard Antarctica fron minerals development ? I think it 's having , an objective , environmentally strong , legal regime to govern that activity if it were advanced . The standards under cRAmRA are so high they will be virtually impossible to meet . " <p> The twenty voting members ( now twenty-five ) of the ATS adopted the Wellington Convention in June of 1988 . To enter into force , CRAMRA must be formally ratified by sixteen of the original twenty voting parties . Any one of nine nations-the seven that claim parts of Antarctica , plus the United States and the Soviet Union can block withholding ratification . So far , no nation has ratified the convention , but seventeen , including the Unites States , have signed it , indicating intent to ratify . <p> But advocates of the World Park idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenpeace International and other environmental groups ha gathered more than two million signatures on various international petitions favoring the idea . Their cause received a huge boost in May 1989 when the government of Australia announced not sign CRAMRA , and again in August , when the governments of France and Australia issued a joint statement that " mining in Antarctica is not compatible with protection of the fragile Antarctic environment . " They declared th the two governments will instead work together to draw up comprehensive protection measures designed to " turn the Antarctic into a wilderness reserve . " <p> The deadline for ratifying the Wellington remains open-ended . But refusal to ratify by either Australia or France- both claimant countries would kill CRAMRA . Recently a number of other nations , including Italy , Belgium , West Germany , Spain , India , and even the Soviet Union have expressed varying degrees of reservations about CFRAMRA and/or support for a wilderness reserve . Late last year the General Assembly of the United Nations overwhelmingly passed a resolution for a global wilderness with a ban on mining in Antarctica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prime movers behind the CRAMRA negotiations-announced its decision to " set aside consideration " of the convention . <p> Back in Washington , meanwhile , the State Department has continued to assert that consensus for a permanent ban would be impossible to obtain ; that such a ban would be " unworkable " in any case , and that it remains U.S. policy to exploit minerals in Antarctica " if it 's environmentally sound and everybody agrees , " according to Scully . State is therefore drawing up enabling legislation for CRAMRA and revising the 1982 Environmental Impact Statement for the convention , in preparation for submitting it to the Senate for ratification . <p> Many American environmentalists and their allies on Capitol Hill would like to see the United States reverse its policy . " We need to make it a major priority , " says George T. Frampton , Jr. , President of The Wilderness Society , " to get the United States to change its position and provide international leadership for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic . " To that end , The Wilderness Society has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influential environmental organizations . " Most governments have assumed over the last 1 5 20 years that banning minerals development is not possible in Antarctica , " says Frampton . " Now , all of a sudden , it is , " thanks to the initiative of Australia and France , and grass-roots environmental awareness . " We now have an opportunity like no opportunity has existed since 1957 to protect the whole ' wilderness continent , " ' he says . <p> Reaction on Capitol Hill has been gratifying to World Park supporters . In September , Senator Albert Gore , Jr. , ( DTenn. ) and twelve cosponsors , introduced Joint Resolution 206 , calling for " full protection of Antarctica as a global ecological commons " and work towards an agreement on an indefinite ban on all commercial mining activities arctica . Congressman Wayne 0wens Ut. ) and seventeen cosponsors intoduced a corresponding resolution in the House . The joint resolutions have so far attracted twenty Senate and fifty-one House cosponsors . Activates hope the measure will signal president Bush that it would be a losing proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative Silvio O. Conte ( R-MA ) has introduced H.R. 3977 , which proposes a unilaterial permanent ban on Americans ' engaging in minerals activities , regulates tourism in the Antarctic , extends the National Environmental Policy Act to all U.S. government-sponsored activities Antarctica , and directs the State Department to conduct negotiations toward an international agreement to ban all mining activities by all nations . In March , Congressman Walter B. Jones , ( D-NC ) introduced H.R. 4210 , which complements the Conte legislation . The bill provides for controls on waste and sewage disposal , and other environmental measures agreed to by the ATs parties at their meeting in Paris in October 1989 . <p> The topic of protecting the frozen continent will only get hotter in the months ATS parties are scheduled to meet in Santiago , Chile , in November this year-both to work out details on liability questions for CRAMRA and to hash out the issue of comprehensive environmental protection for Antarctica . Various proposals for environmental protection are expected to fill the agenda , including a French and Australian proposal , a proposal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Ocean Coalition ( ASOC ) , which represents some 200 organizations in thirty-five countries , and compromise proposals for modifying CRAMRA and adding a twenty- or even thirty-year mining moratorium . <p> Whatever the outcome in November , consensus is growing that the world 's last global commons , the near-pristine continent of Antarctica , is far too precious to be savaged for the enrichment of a few or the garnering of a few years ' worth of oil or other minerals . In the words of Sir Peter Scott , son of the great British explorer , " We should have the wisdom to know when to leave a place alone .
