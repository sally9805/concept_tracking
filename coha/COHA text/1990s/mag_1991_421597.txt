SQUEEZING OIL FROM A SHRINKING WORLD SUPPLY <p> Even as tank treads f lay the oilrich sands nine time zones to the east , oilmen fighting on the home front in Liberal , Kansas , share a thermos of Folgers instant and discuss their own strategy for forcing thousands of barrels of crude oil out of a lease that began to dry up ten years ago . It 's a tactic called water injection . <p> " For oil recovery , it 's nothing new , " says Mark Rinehart , an engineer for Anadarko Petroleum . " But our method of using purified sewage water is unique to the world . " <p> The earth holds an estimated ultimate resource of 1.744 trillion barrels of oil , and at our present consumption rate , 64 million barrels per day  --  enough to fill Lake Erie one and a half times  --  that new Camaro may sputter its last in about 75 years , according to unofficial U.S. Department of Energy estimates . That 's the good news . The bad news : Sixty-six percent of the proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States importing half its oil and the rest getting more expensive to refine , we 've reached the point where  --  like Mad Max  --  we 're ready to fight for what 's left . " If there was n't oil in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , we would n't be there , " says former senator George McGovern . <p> But while we pay in blood and money to keep our Camaros running on global oil , U.S. producers are steering off in new directions to retrieve hard-to-produce oil , and toward new production methods that sweep more oil from deposits they once thought drained , " A lot of American production today relies on finding small fields and producing them efficiently  --  high-tech solutions , " says Grant Lichtman , vice president of Jebco Seismic , an oil exploration firm . <p> Advances in technology , for example , now allow producers to drill into deposits horizontally , for more efficient , higher-producing wells . The horizontal well begins as a typical vertical well for the first few thousand feet , but directional gyros and computerized sensors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well 's path 90 ' and toward the suitable coordinates . <p> Tom Sullivan , a spokesman for Oryx Energy Company , an oil exploration and production firm , compares it to playing mumblety-peg with your hand in a pool of oil and your eyes closed . Think of the knife blade as the drill . " Every time you hit your finger you 're drilling a dry hole , and then you still may not tap into all the vertical deposits of oil between your fingers , " he says . " But if you slide the blade underneath your fingers you can get at all the oil . " It costs more , " but it does n't cost as much as drilling dry wells in each finger , " Sullivan says . <p> Imagine , however , the bad blood arising if you punched into the oil on the lease of another . " You have to carefully outline to regulatory agencies where you 're drilling and follow it to make sure you 're not draining the guy next door , " Sullivan says . <p> Petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shell Oil continues setting deep water drilling records in the Gulf of Mexico : The company simultaneously built the world 's deepest offshore platform and . its tallest structure ( 92 feet more than Chicago 's Sears Tower ) with its 1,615 foot Bullwinkle fixed platform . By 1993 Shell hopes to pump oil from its Auger platform , a floating platform held in water 2,860 feet deep by vertical " tendons . " And for a preview of deeper things to come , the company has recently drilled an exploration well in 7,520 feet of water . <p> But the deeper companies explore , the more chances they take with the environment . " In three thousand feet of water you have that many more feet of water where something could go wrong , " says energy specialist Rob Watson of the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , a national environmental group . Hi points to the July 1980 explosion at the drilling platform Ixtoc , in the Gulf of Mexico . " An explosion of that type , " he says , " at the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to avoid in deeper water . " <p> For tapping into landlocked , untouched U.S. oil reserves , a dwindling group of companies think they 've a better way : mining . Geologists estimate that portions of Utah , Colorado , and Wyoming hold up to 1.8 trillion barrels of oil trapped in oil shale . One company , Unocal Corporation , struck a rich vein near Grand Junction , Colorado . By heating the shale to 900 degrees F to release the oil , the company now produces up to 7,000 barrels of the so-called synthetic crude oil per day . Workers scatter the spent shale-it takes 2,520 pounds of shale to produce one barrel of oil-near the mine , spread topsoil over it , and revegetate the area . " The deer love it , " says Unocal spokesman Jeff CaIlender . <p> Keeping a home for the deer and antelope to play is Unocal 's brightest note , however , Unscheduled shutdowns , to clear spent shale , plague the production plant , which has yet to reach its design capacity of 10,000 barrels a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs between $45 and $50 to produce , compared with $4.82 for a barrel of U.S. oil , and $2 per barrel for everybody 's favorite , Saudi oil . The company receives price support from the government-up to $400 million by 1996  --  to make up the difference between the price it sells the oil and what it costs to produce . After price supports run out , CaIlender 's not sure . whether the company will keep the operation going . " When oil rises to fifty dollars a barrel , shale is n't the only economically feasible energy option , " he says . <p> But the NRDC 's Watson says , " How much energy does it cost to produce one barrel , when you heat the shale up to nine hundred degrees ? " <p> To remove the oil from the shale , many synthetic oil companies have employed a slurry process , which uses up large volumes of water from this already parched area . Watson says , " The environmental cost is not rolled into the alternative fuel cost . " <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would open up 1.5 million acres of Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) to exploratory drilling . " It may be only one percent of the land , " Watson says , " but it lies along the shore-it 's teeming with wildlife , and any oil we take from there wo n't make a dent in the U.S. oil deficit . " <p> The administration wants to find more of this " easy oil , " also known as primary oil : the gushers that make Texas wildcatters dance around in crude blackface , the bubblin ' ooze that propelled the likes of Jed Clampett to Beverly Hills . It accounts for just 12 to 15 percent of a deposit 's oil . Secondary recovery  --  like the water-injection field in Kansas  --  can flood another 15 to 20 percent from a field . <p> For years secondary recovery meant injecting salt water  --  a by-product in many deposits  --  down the deposit 's center wells , and forcing oil to wells on the perimeter . When prices rise , producers find increasingly ingenious and expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At one Southern California lease , Oryx and Mission Energy use steam , heated by natural gas ( another by-product of oil production ) , to get at one especially gooey deposit . And in a new procedure , workers inject microbes and molasses into a deposit , seal it , and let it they pump water into this brew and pump thinner oil out . Oil deposits tend to lie deeper than ground water , so there 's seldom worry about injectants becoming pollutants . I mean , is anyone worried about polluting the crude oil ? <p> Then there 's the $2 million Anadarko project in Liberal , Kansas , the center of the dust bowl in the Dirty Thirties . With not enough salt water or natural gas in the deposit for normal injection , and water scarce enough that Kansas law prohibits oilmen from drilling into the aquifer for injection water , Anadarko engineers looked at Liberal 's huge waste-water evaporation lakes , paused , and took a deep breath . <p> After negotiating with the city 's sanitation department to buy that which most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a purification plant next to the sewage treatment plant . Filtering the water to remove minute particles , which could corrode pipes and plug the oil deposit , the plant pumps the water 12 miles north into injection wells , flushing fresh crude oil to the surface . <p> After showing off the plant 's filtration tanks , which brim with beads made from plastic milk cartons , plant operator Bill Glick says , over the din of highspeed pumps , " One state official said our water was cleaner than Liberal 's drinking water . " ( With a hint in the air of the sewage treatment plant next door , no one , however , looks willing to try a glass . ) Rinehart adds , " And who 's to say that , to get our drinking water , one day it wo n't come to this ? " <p> After all , to get oil , it already has . <p> Yet secondary oil recovery-bringing oil to the wells instead of wells to oil-remains preferable to more exploratory drilling in new wilderness campaigns . Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road Warrior , we sop up gas with a handkerchief after a car crash . Oil , however , is a nonrenewable resource : We 'll be sopping it sooner or later . " The more time we waste going into places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , the more time we waste developing alternatives , " says the NRDC 's Watson . " We should drill for oil in Detroit , " by forcing automakers to raise fuel consumption standards to 60 miles per gallon by 2010 . But the thought of society running out of gas in 2066 may be a worry too far down the road . <p> " Oil will not disappear overnight , " says Earl Ross , a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute . " It will continue to be our primary energy source for some time to come , and more oil is going to be discovered in the future . That 's not saying it 's going to be cheap oil , but we 'll find it .
