At first glance the new crime dramas Profiler ( Saturdays , 10 p.m . EDT , NBC ) and Millennium ( Fridays , 9 p.m . EDT , Fox ) seem like the sort of unwholesome entertainment that would send Bob Dole into a frenzied new round of Hollywood bashing . The shows share the same premise : a central character brings down Hannibal Lecter-type psychopaths by using an uncanny gift to see inside the criminal mind , literally envisioning the evildoers ' motivations . In the process both series serve up images unusually brutal for prime-time TV : severed heads , bodies crackling in flames , victims buried alive , near naked women beaten and stabbed to death . <P> Yet beneath the bloody mayhem lies the same knotty issue that the Republican presidential candidate has himself been working hard to articulate : How do we keep home , hearth and the middle-class dream from eroding in a world ravaged by crime , drugs and sexual confusion ? Profiler 's Samantha Waters ( Ally Walker ) and Millennium 's Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) are obsessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dice their way into the crime fighters ' paths but with keeping the world impenetrably safe for their small children . <P> Millennium , produced by The X-Files creator Chris Carter and one of the most eagerly awaited debuts of the fall season , suffers from delivering its point too aggressively . The show is constantly contrasting the bleak offices and dark labs in which Black works to hunt the deranged cult leaders and sexual serial killers who are his prey , with the image of his blindingly yellow Seattle home , framed always by a blue sky that is eerie in its brilliance . Says Carter : " For me the whole reason to do the show was that yellow house  --  a bright center in a dark universe . " Meet Frank Black , Everypatriarch , on a mission to keep ugliness from tainting his family . <P> And it is a mission he does n't take lightly . Henriksen , a craggy-faced , baggy-eyed actor , portrays Black as the kind of guy who would n't crack a smile if Strom Thurmond showed up in his driveway doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel world . Speaking always in an exhausted whisper , Black is so intense that a perfunctory how are you doing from his wife Catherine ( Megan Gallagher ) elicits the answer , " I 'm just confused about something I thought I understood about evil . " <P> Yet as over the top as Millennium can get , the show does succeed at creating a marvelously unrelenting sense of unease . Black is a former FBI agent who now works for a quasi-governmental law-enforcement organization known as the Millennium group . He has amassed enemies over his long career , and every time the camera turns to one of his co-workers or a friendly new neighbor attempting a chat , there is the sense that his haven could crack like a Pottery Barn picture frame .
