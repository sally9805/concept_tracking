<p> THE ISSUE : A recent study from the federal Glass Ceiling Commission says women represent just 3 percent of Fortune 1000 managers and women 's pay still lags far behind that of white men . Still , many people are calling for an end to affirmative action for women and minorities . Which side is right ? <p> Figures do n't lie <p> Just as the Glass Ceiling Commission released another disheartening report on women in the workplace , the assault on affirmative action was stepped up . U.S. Sen. Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) has vowed to overturn all laws and executive orders that keep the doors cracked for women and minority men . <p> Dole was the Senate force behind creation of the Glass Ceiling Commission in 1991 - he 's obviously putting his presidential aspirations above fairness now . <p> At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , President Bill has decided to " review " affirmative action . Women 's groups marched on the White House this week to demand support from a president elected by women . <p> A national fax campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the administration not to slam the workplace door in our faces once again . If you 're too young to have ever been told , " We do n't hire women , " just ask your mother or aunt . <p> &gt; Fax Sen. Bob Dole at ( 202 ) 228-4569. &gt; Fax the White House at ( 202 ) 456-6703 or ( 202 ) 456-6218 . Martha Burk is president of the Washington Feminist Faxnet . Do n't say goodbye yet By Bonnie Erbe <p> Both sides , unfortunately , are right . White men and women are justifiably infuriated when they lose jobs , promotions or coveted slots in college or graduate school to someone less qualified . Minorities and women are equally justified in feeling they are still being denied their due , either in terms of controlling capital ( the true source of power in our society ) , running the nation 's major corporations or in high-level federal and local government posts . <p> Nonetheless , it is too early to dismiss affirmative action . Why ? The federal Glass Ceiling Commission report released last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hiring and promotion in most American industries . <p> The report confirms 95 percent of corporate America 's upper management ( defined as vice president and above ) are still white and male . It shows these white males perceive women as " not being tough enough " to manage . They think black males are " undisciplined , always late , " and they see Hispanic men as " heavy drinkers and drug users who do n't want to work . " <p> Until they have had enough one-on-one exposure to debunk those stereotypes , upper management needs to be coaxed into promoting minorities and women , rather than being left to their own devices . <p> Some will say that women make lifestyle choices ( i.e. having children ) that slow them down on the career track . Some do , that 's true . But how does she explain that minority men lag way behind their white counterparts on the corporate management track ? Are they , too , staying home to raise children ? Doubtful . <p> There is one reasonable alternative to affirmative action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier and cheaper for targets of discrimination to sue their employers . That would be a strong disincentive to workplace racism and sexism . <p> Funny , though , the same folks who want to kill affirmative action also want to make it much more difficult for targets of discrimination to sue . Maybe they just do n't want to give women and minorities equal opportunity . <p> Bonnie Erbe , host of the PBS program " To the Contrary , " is legal affairs correspondent for the Mutual/NBC Radio networks . <p> Second-class citizens By Paul Craig Roberts <p> Never has a study been so out of tune with its time as this month 's report from the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission . Just when the public and politicians are demanding the termination of quotas , a presidential commission has surfaced demanding more quotas . <p> Even Sen. Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who introduced the Glass Ceiling Act in 1991 and is responsible for the creation of the Glass Ceiling Commission , has recently repented and disavowed the affirmative action policies that discriminate against white males . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it want more . The commission - 75 percent female in composition - complains that women ca n't get anywhere because of " white male prejudices . " The credibility of the allegation is impaired not only by female domination of the commission , but also by their career successes : a U.S. senator , two U.S. representatives , a bank president , corporate vice presidents and senior vice presidents , attorneys and presidents of consulting firms . <p> Ambition has taken on new meaning if these women consider themselves held down by " the glass ceiling . " Believe it or not , this group of power- lunching female dynamos actually wrote that " prejudice against minorities and white women continues to be the single most important barrier to their advancement . " <p> It is even less credulous that these hard-driving women are held at bay by corporate pipsqueaks who are so afraid of women that they " feel at risk " and are overcome with " white male anxiety . " <p> The chutzpah of this report is amazing . The only legally sanctioned discrimination in corporate America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , which cost taxpayers $ 1.5 million , lists the gender and race privileges conferred by 87 companies , including " accelerated career plans " that provide " supertracks " up the corporate ladder designed to bypass white men . <p> If " white-maleism " were the fearsome force portrayed in the commission 's report , these 87 companies that systematically discriminate against white males would face a crippling white male boycott of their products , stocks and bonds . <p> All white male careers are on hold while those privileged by skin color and genitalia take precedence . In the U.S. today , white males are second-class citizens . <p> Paul Craig Roberts , former assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury , is chairman of the Institute for Political Economy and a distinguished fellow of the Cato Institute . <p> ' Real ' reasons for inequity By Betsy Hart <p> Black college-educated women now out-earn white college-educated women . Black Ph.d . ' s from quality institutions significantly out-earn their white counterparts . In fact , all else being equal , a black , married , college-educated male virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But despite 30 years of affirmative action , overall black employment rates have not increased . And the real reason - which liberals avoid like the plague - is that all else is not equal , and liberals are responsible . They have largely consigned minorities to useless , violent , government- run inner-city schools . Welfare policies have destroyed the two-parent family . And the left has refused to fight crime . <p> As for women , most freely make career choices in favor of family . But consider that for never-married men and women ages 25 to 34 , there is no real wage difference ! <p> True , most upper-management today is white male . But these old bulls are largely in their late 50s , and entered their career pipelines 30 years ago , when women and minorities were n't allowed in . Fortunately , their sometimes ugly attitudes will largely leave when they do , making way for the new generation of women and minorities now coming right behind them in that pipeline . <p> Betsy Hart is a former White House spokeswoman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
