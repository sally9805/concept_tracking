At the school where tomorrow 's torch singers learn to break your heart , everybody suffers <p> By Wednesday afternoon , the sixth day of the 1996 cabaret symposium , the good earth of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford , Connecticut , is strewn with the carcasses of collapsed entertainers . <p> The 35 vibrant young cabaret singers who rolled in Friday night belting out Irving Berlin and dog-easing Harold Arlen arrangements are , with very few exceptions , complete wrecks . It is not uncommon to run into a chanteuse sniffling tearfully on the paths connecting barn to cottage to mansion to dorm . <p> Some of them have fallen asleep sitting up or stretched out on picnic tables , laid low by a singing schedule that begins at the crack of 9 a.m. and ends at maybe 1 a.m. , when the last diva sighs out the last version of " Ca n't Get Out of This Mood . " <p> Day by day , hour by hour , over and over , they have had to stand up in front of such old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a standard  --  maybe " When the Sun Comes Out " or " All the Things You Are " or " The More I See You "  --  and then confront , under ruthless interrogation , the way they connect the song to their own tormented personal lives . <p> In cabaret , the emotional impact of songs is everything . Superb vocal quality is a secondary issue . Honesty and intimacy come first . <p> " We 're kind of going for something behind your eyes - if that makes any sense , " symposium artistic director Ellie Ellsworth tells them the first night . <p> And what are the students going for ? They are already singing  --  in a hotel with a trio , on cruise ships , with reputable bands-for-hire . A couple of them are an audition or two away from getting some Broadway work , some touring , a recording contract , headline gigs in the really fabulous New York and London rooms . In other words , a career as an entertainer , for God 's sake . <p> The shape of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of what is called " immersion . " In a dusky converted barn , the singers take the stage and sing . Sometimes before they finish , the voices of coaches and teachers ring out from the darkness . <p> First up is Jack Donahue , a darkly handsome bari-tenor who left Charlottesville , Virginia , to seek his fortune in New York City just after the symposium concluded . He sings " When I Look at You , " by Frank Wildhorn  --  from , he says , " the musicalization of The Scarlet Pimpernel . " <p> If the choice seems a trifle recherche , well , that 's sort of the deal in cabaret . Digging up odd little garnets by semiobscure songwriters is very fashionable . Equally acceptable is reaching back for a Rodgers and Hart cookie so entrenched in the canon that it 's inert . What is simply not done , oddly , is to sing Sondheim , who 's not fresh and hip enough to be alive nor remote and cured enough to be dead . Sondheim is sort of dying his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With the flair and vocal production of a young Robert Goulet ( and I mean that in a good way ) , Donahue dashes off the number , a song of a man recalling the younger version of his current lover . And then those interrogating voices start up from the darkness . <p> Voice : " Which do you like better ? " Donahue : " I like the person I remember . " Voice : " I got that you were really sad . " <p> Donahue : " I think it was an apology for maybe having to be this open . " <p> Voice : " Are you telling this person : ' If you do n't change , I 'm going to depart ' ? " <p> Donahue : " The way I feel it : ' I still love you . You 're still a part of me . Hopefully this information I 'm giving you will help us to move on . ' " <p> Voice : " You kept making me want to cry . " <p> Crying is not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most emotionally suggestible people in the galaxy  --  not a big surprise given their decision , often at a tender age , to spend enormous chunks of their lives memorizing Jule Styne lyrics . <p> Much later in the immersion , on Saturday afternoon , a willowy , neurotic-looking woman named Sarah Dacey Charles will launch into Stephen Schwartz 's " Meadowlark , " start to weep on the fourth note of the first bar and sing the whole number crying all the way . And then a weeping virus will infect the assembly , so that nobody will be able to sing anything , not even " You Ca n't Rollerskate in a Buffalo Herd , " without sobbing . <p> But that 's later . Up next is Aaron Bond , another tall , good-looking New York City boy with a kind of Anthony Newley style . He makes the possibly unwise choice of " A Change of Sky , " a portentous song by Philip Springer . <p> Bond 's performance is technically smashing , but the more he pushes to connect with the audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The voices from the darkness exhort him to speak the lyrics . <p> " What Dick Rodgers always said was : ' Sing Oscar 's words , not my music , ' " rasps actor and writer Max Showalter . <p> The faculty is big on speaking the lyrics and writing them out in longhand before one ever tries to sing them . With Johnny Mercer , for example , this reveals all sorts of profundities and levels of shrewdness . <p> Not so with " A Change of Sky . " Instead , Bond tries to say , " Guess I 'll have to go where moon and stars are waiting there for me , " without sounding like an idiot - a feat that would have been beyond the powers of William Jennings Bryan . <p> The " fourth wall " between performer and audience is a subject of manic concern in cabaret , and Ellsworth , trying to help Bond bond , tells him to ask questions of his fellow campers seated in the audience . <p> " Cindy , " he begins , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at the song a bit more , but he is still , in the opinion of the voices , dropping back , being a vocalist instead of a great communicator . <p> " Aaron , " says a voice , " what part of your home in New York would you like to redecorate ? " <p> This is Ron Cohn , a perpetually amused-looking New York cabaret producer who has , in addition to teaching duties , the symposium job known as Diva Patrol  --  a nebulous gig which involves making sure that everybody eats and sleeps and stays appropriately frightened of ticks , jellyfish , skunks and other Connecticut fauna . <p> " The bedroom , " says Aaron . " It 's white . " <p> " And what color would you like it to be ? " <p> " I think , " says Aaron seriously , " I would do a soft terra-cotta . " <p> From the darkness come hoots and roars of merriment and the voice of Ellsworth shouting , " Sing , sing ! " Catching a wave of good feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity . <p> But how many times can anyone , even a cabaret singer , examine the colors of his or her life ? By Wednesday , nerves and vocal cords are frayed in equal measure . Halfway through the week , Barbara Ann Little , a sweetfaced band singer with a pretty voice and not much stage presence , is working on " I 'm Old-Fashioned " in one of the smaller classes . <p> " Barbara , are you passionate about being old-fashioned ? " asks Cohn . <p> " Well , " she answers beseechingly , " I 'm trying to be . " <p> " It 's musical EST , " chuckles Shari Lynn , a middle-aged Midleresque blonde from Kailua , Hawaii . During immersion , Lynn was coaxed by the voices , while in the middle of the peppy Ray Jessel salute " Wan na Sing a Show Tune , " into telling the O. Henry story of her husband who , in order to defray her $1,5oo tuition , plus travel costs , plus lost work time , sold the used car the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn out of sis-boombah , stagey bonhomie and into the kind of vulnerability and personal candor so prized in cabaret . <p> For days , the great singers have been accused  --  in the nicest tones possible - of hiding behind their talent . The less-than-great singers have been gently urged to consult their sheet music for the actual notes Mr. Kern wrote . <p> Actually , there are n't that many less-than-great singers present . Almost all of the 35 are singing professionally . Many of them are also holding down day jobs . They 're working in the FAO Schwarz phone room . They 're buyers for gift shops or public-relations directors or movie theater managers . Quite a few of them have dabbled in the business of preparing or serving food to people . <p> Looking around the group , Carleton Gillenwater , a tall , fey ex-dancer from Santa Rosa , California , grins and says , " We could 've started the restaurant of death with the talent we 've got here . " <p> The most obvious star-in-the-making from the class of ' 96 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a San Francisco jazz singer on the cusp of stardom , makes ends meet by waiting tables even as she readies herself for a two-week gig at New York 's Algonquin a mere six weeks after the conference ends . <p> For all the faculty 's compulsive tinkering - which extends to sending Judy Garland impersonator Tommy Femia up on stage to unbutton the blouse of a student named Maeve Spain while she sings , not passionately enough , a Gershwin tune  --  nobody messes much with Paula West because nobody can figure out how to make her better . <p> " She has that thing , whatever that thing is , " says Ellsworth . <p> Wednesday is also full of angst from the previous night 's chalk talk by Fred Voelpel , a deeply crusty and misanthropic theatrical designer , who told all the campers , in a plenary lecture on physical appearance , that most of them have been walking around for days looking like hews charwomen . <p> Flying in the face of the symposium organizers ' crypto-Esalen assurances that this is a safe place to dismantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel away the showbiz mask , Voelpel tells the campers , " People are judging you all the time . " <p> His point being maybe that it was n't such a great idea to wear the same sweaty culottes three days in a row at a conference peopled by theatrical heavies , songwriters , club owners and music directors . Particularly if you are a man . <p> " There were people crying in the ladies ' room , " confides Maye Cavallaro , another Bay Area crooner . <p> Out at the picnic tables , Gillenwater and Thomas DiVemiero , a ponytailed chain-smoker from New York , are chuckling about Voelpel . " He made some of those wonderful , sweet vulnerable people who think it 's all about talent so upset ? Gillenwater says . <p> " This is a tough business , " DiVerniero agrees . <p> " I can do this as an exaggerated hobby or as a business , and the only difference is how hard I fight . You figure out what you do n't have , and you get it , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turned a corner . For days , he 's been struggling with his voice , spooked into a set of raw , frozen cords by the symposium 's emphasis on lyrics and psychological connections over vocal production . <p> On Wednesday afternoon , in a small workshop , Gillenwater stands up to sing a semi-obscure Rodgers and Hart ballad , " you 're Nearer , " and his rich , woody baritone comes flooding back like water into a cranberry bog . <p> The song is affecting , even haunting , and it brings Anne Francine up on stage to stand at Gillenwater 's side . Francine , after a lengthy career on Broadway , in movies and on television , suffered a whopping stroke a few years ago . <p> Deeply aphasic , she has developed an astonishing repertoire of moans , groans , sighs and gestures . On this occasion , she grabs Gillenwater 's head . <p> " Ba Baaaa Ba , " she imitates his singing . She points his head at one comer of the room . <p> " Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front row . <p> Lesson complete . She hugs him and scurries back to her seat . <p> " Look at us , " says Farah Alvin . Alvin , 20 , has already impressed the other campers ( " fellows , " in symposium speak ) as having probably the biggest , cleanest , Plexiglas-shattering pipes in the group . Now she is sitting at a picnic table , wanly picking at an early dinner . A $250-a-night view of Long Island Sound spreads out before her , but she does not look up . <p> " We 're sallow , we 're tired , people are sniffling , " she says , dryly amused . <p> Are we not divas ? No , we are DEVO . <p> The good news is that this is the low point . By Saturday night , the fellows will have snapped themselves together . The nine days of intensive coaching and questioning for which they shelled out $1,500 will begin to seep in . The 35 fellows will perform a glittering revue to a packed house . <p> But before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is an individual critique of one 's appearance , clothes , makeup , posture and general demeanor by the pitiless Voelpel . <p> Voelpel , paradoxically , has bad posture , rumpled clothes , unkempt hair and a weight problem . He grants audiences to groups of seven or eight singers . One by one they change into their showtime outfits and parade before him . Voelpel is different manifestations of a Hindu divinity , a creator and destroyer in one . <p> His exchange with Karen Hirst , a sad-but-tough-looking singer creeping into middle age , is typical . <p> " You have a tendency to look down . Never do that again . Ever . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because it is very unattractive . And you and I both know you need every card you 've got . Now look up . Do n't you feel more attractive ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well . Live there . You might get yourself some Joan Crawford shoes , some bad shoes . If you 're going to do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway . You have a brush ? " <p> " Here ? " <p> " No . In your life . Hair has got to be sexy . Yours , I would bitch it up . Lacquer it up real bitchy . " <p> Paula West , an African-American woman with a tendency toward chunkiness , shows up in a gauzy black dress . Voelpel is pleased , sort of . " There 's a mysterious , otherwordly look with this dress that I 've never seen before , " he muses , fussing with it . <p> But he catches West bending at the waist and becomes cross . " You ca n't double up . Never ! This is not recording . This is not the studio . This is about taking the room ! " he fumes . " The only way this is going to work is if you suck it in and keep your spine up . Otherwise you 're going to look like a big , black laundry bag . " <p> Jeez . <p> The week draws to a dose , but each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely so much on a superb singing voice . Use it only when you need to . Work the rest of the time on sharing your humanity . <p> " The songs are a conduit to you , " explains director Jack Wrangler in one workshop . " Think of it in terms of a blind date . Neither one of us knows what we 're going to get . Each song tells us a little more about you . " <p> Which also means , he says , that you should n't confide too much too fast . " If you 're on a blind date , you do n't want to tell them about the time you slit your wrists , and your mother went off with someone strange . " <p> All the teachers like to repeat an axiom offered at a previous year 's cabaret camp by Sylvia Syms : When you stop listening to the sound of your voice and start listening to the sound of your heart , you 'll be a singer . " <p> In the dark barn , a refulgent summer afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campers about a night when Liza Minnelli turned up at his club . Raible is the owner of Eighty Eight 's , the navel of the New York cabaret scene . He had a young singer working in the club who was doing a tune , " Bobo 's Bar and Grill , " from Minnelli 's repertoire . The guy worked up the nerve to approach her and discuss it . <p> The singer came back after an hour and said , " That was amazing . She explained her motivation on every word , including the ' ands ' and the ' thes . ' At the end of which , Minnelli said , " Or " ( exhales a dramatic plume of cigarette smoke ) , " You could just sing the f  --  er . There 's always that . " <p> At cabaret camp , closing night is opening night . The campers put on their fanciest outfits and , in a swish of satin and sequins , show the world what they 've learned . In the buzz backstage before the show begins , Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  love  --  you , " she groans . Great cheering . <p> She points to her head . " Think ! " the campers yell . She spreads her arms . " Sing ! " they yell . <p> She flicks her hands near her sternum . " From the heart ! " they shout . <p> What follows is three rather dazzling hours . Powerhouses , charmers , belters , crooners , one by one the campers grab the mike and try to take the room , to hit the backwall . Some of them , under the pressure of a full house , fall back into the " vocalist mode " and park their humanity and vulnerability somewhere in a notebook . But even so , they 're exciting to watch . <p> Up in a balcony , I catch myself thinking about Nancy LaMott who for years was probably the best talent in New York cabaret . LaMott had " that thing , whatever that thing is . " She died young , of cancer , in 1995 . You 'd be lucky to find one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dying day . <p> At the end of the show I find Voelpel lurking out in the misty Waterford night . I ask him what 's going to happen to all that talent out there . " Probably not a lot , " he says dourly . " It 's not an organized industry . It 's a very fuzzy business . There 's about maybe five that are worth a career investment . " <p> Voelpel asks if I 've ever seen The Gig . No , but I know what he 's talking about , a Douglas Cohen musical about amateur musicians who hook up with a professional . <p> At the end of the show , Voelpel explains , the pro is explaining to one of the amateurs why the latter wo n't be able to move up into the former 's ranks . <p> " It 's not a religion , " says the pro . " Meaning ? " asks the amateur . " Devotion is n't enough . " <p> Voelpel says those words and , with a saturnine nod , walks into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that follow , though , the most enterprising singers get a lot of work . Cards arrive in the mail announcing gigs in and around New York City . The fellows and faculty go to each other 's shows . In the fall , Paula West makes her debut at the Oak Room . She stuns the audience twice , first with her talent and then with the wrenching admission that she still supports herself as a waitress . And then , as if she had heard Voelpel on that late-summer night , she quotes Ezra Pound : TABLE <p> THE FOLLOWING MARCH , THE PUBLICATION BACKSTAGE gives its annual Bistro awards for cabaret .
