Cycling tutors have traditionally been a secretive lot . Then they found a method that worked , they often did n't share their insights with others . Only a select few riders would ever benefit from even the best coaches ' knowledge . U.S. national coaching director Chris Carmichael is out to change all that . " Project 96 " ( coordinated by Bicycling Fitness Advisory Board member Ed Burke , Ph.D. ) is a national program designed to pool information and develop technology and training methods that will help U.S. athletes attain optimum performance at the Atlanta Olympics . One of the best and most recent examples of how Project 96 can benefit all cyclists  --  including you  --  was the " Solidarity Coaching Conference . " At the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , Carmichael organized the biggest gathering of cycling brainpower ever assembled . Cycling coaches , physicians and sports scientists from Italy , Spain , the former East Germany , Canada , and the U.S. met to share their findings . Bicycling was there to collect the best tips , techniques , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champ Lance Armstrong ( of Motorola ) , ONCE 's Alex Zulle , and top pro sprinter Olaf Ludwig ( Telekom ) ? Keep reading for an exclusive lesson from the world 's best cycling brains . Massimo Testa M.D. , Motorola team physician Testa has been the physician for Motorola ( and its earlier incarnation , 7-Eleven ) for 10 years . He plans training for nearly all Motorola riders , and is internationally respected for defining the best combination of work and rest that pro riders need to maintain form through the grueling 9-month rac e season . Carmichael , a former 7-Eleven team rider says , " Using medical knowledge and finesse , he got me through a Giro d'Italia when I was having digestive problems . I think of him as my doctor , too . " Rest is important all year around . Says Testa : " I used to prescribe lots of intensity , but maybe the riders were overtrained . Now I schedule more rest days along with several easy weeks during the season . Top European pro Adriano Baffi trained only every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We watch carefully for signs of overtraining , including decreased power , speed and performance ; increased recovery time ; tactical mistakes including dumb crashes ; digestive trouble ; weight loss ; anxiety and depression ; and a bad attitude . If these signs appear , we modify their training . Recreational riders can do the same . If you crash or get sick or have bad psychology , you have to take some time off . " Strength and flexibility are important . " We try to prevent problems by doing abdominal exercises and stretching . A study has shown that cyclists increase their power by 5 percent merely by stretching the hamstrings , because added flexibility means better utilization of the quads . We also change their position on the bike if it 's needed . But we never adjust their position during the race season even if it 's bad because they would n't have time to adjust and might get injured . " In the off-season , we use rollers three to five times a week to improve balance and spin . And we do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Studies show that Tour de France riders gain body fat during the race because they lose muscle volume , especially in the upper body . Winter is the time to counter that effect . We do three sets of 25 reps at 50 percent of the maximum they can lift in that exercise , followed by two sets of 50 reps at 25 percent of max weight . We use high reps and low weights because when you pedal , you use a small percentage of maximum strength on each pedal stroke . We also do some climbs of 4-6 minutes at 50-60 rpm to build strength and muscle mass . " Tudor Bompa Ph.D. , professor at York University in Toronto Often called the " father of periodization training , " Bompa is a legendary figure among endurance coaches . His theories were the basis for East German and Soviet success in the ' 80s , and he advocated weight training for endurance athletes before it became widely accepted . Plan to meet your goals  --  but do n't be rigid . According to Bompa , " Training regimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total stress load in your life , not just the stress from training . Total stress includes job , family , school . You ca n't divorce training from other aspects of your life . " Too much intensity is dangerous . " You only improve if you overload your system with occasional hard training . But overloading often leads to overtraining . If you regenerate with easy rides and rest , you 'll supercompensate and be better . Do n't think ' hard work . ' Instead , think ' intelligent work . ' Most North Americans are overtrained . When you 're ready , you 'll feel good , physically and mentally . That 's when you should do the big event . " Repeat workouts at least 2-3 times to get a training effect . " If you want to develop endurance for a century ride , plan on a long weekend ride for at least a month or so before the event . " After a hard session , set aside 30 minutes to regenerate . " Sip a carbo replacement drink ; lie down with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute nap . Even if you have to borrow the time from training , you 'll recover much faster . " Weight training deserves another look . " I 've seen some preliminary results on a track pursuiter who weighed 154 pounds and shifted to power lifting for 2 years , then squatted more than 500 pounds . When he returned to the bike , his pursuit time decreased by 5 seconds . Although it 's too early to draw conclusions , this example is fascinating . " Chris Carmichael U.S. national coaching director A former professional rider with the pioneering 7-Eleven team that launched U.S. cycling into the big time , Carmichael 's vision and drive have turned the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs into a worldwide leader in training techniques . Lance Armstrong 's personal coach , Carmichael combines the ability to set broad seasonal goals with minutely planned daily training . Create a vision statement and set goals . " This is important whether you 're an elite rider or preparing to ride your first century , " says Carmichael . " A vision statement should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a long-term goal and direct your actions and emotions . Before you write it , ask yourself , ' If I were to drop dead tomorrow , what would I want people to say about me ? ' Then write it down . That 's your vision statement . For instance , here 's the U.S. pro riders ' group vision statement : 100 percent prepared physically and mentally to race to the full potential of the entire team . " Then they formulated the goals that would help them achieve that : One , a united and committed team . Two , an organized training plan . Three , a clear and defined race strategy . Four , maintain control and commitment to the vision during unplanned disruptions . " With these as guidelines , you should be able to set up your own vision and goals . For instance , number four is a great goal for every recreational rider who has to deal with a job and family . " Dean Golich sports scientist for U.S. national road team Golich has made his mark with hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of recording day-to-day training and exercise intensities of U.S. national team road riders , then interpreting the data , he 's accumulated a wealth of hands-on information . His secret weapon ? He 's a strong rider who can keep up with the national team on most of their training rides and monitor their performance on the road . Ride the devil machine . Says Golich : " This ergometer test devised by the OTC Sports Science and Technology division is a quick way to track your fitness from one month to the next or compare your power to other riders . We often use it to screen riders . You 'll need an ergometer that measures power output in watts . Check at a health club or university human performance lab . The CompuTrainer RacerMate , 800/522-3610 , which we use at the OTC , has this feature . If you are n't interested in comparing yourself to others , you can use a resistance trainer and progressively increase gearing . " After a warm-up , do the following progression : * 0-3 minutes at 110 watts * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts * 9-12 minutes at 340 watts * 12-15 minutes at 410 watts * 15-18 minutes at 480 watts . " These figures are for a 6-foot , 155-pound rider . If you are larger or smaller , increase or decrease watts proportionally . Keep your cadence at 90 . When it falls below 90 for more than 10 seconds , the test is over . This is an all-out test so check with your doctor before attempting it . " Elite national class male riders usually score over 15 minutes for seniors and over 13 for juniors . Women are generally 15-20 percent lower . In a similar test , former Olympic champion and pro racer Olaf Ludwig pounded out 600 watts ! " Race data is better then training data . " If you have a heart-rate monitor that stores information for downloading , wear it during a race or competitive ride . Then compare your maximum heart rate and other information with the data collected during training . Most of our riders find out that they can reach a higher max heart rate , and time trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they can in training . When we know that , we can reset their training zones . For instance , when Lance Armstrong is racing in Europe , he faxes us his heart-rate profile from races . We can suggest how hard he should train the next week . " Calculate intensity zones . " After you determine your max heart rate see Ed Burke 's tips , figure out your zones . This will make sure you 're always riding at the intensity that delivers the most benefit for what you want to accomplish on each ride : * zone 1 : 65 percent of max for recovery rides . * zone 2 : 65-72 percent to develop basic endurance and aerobic capacity . * zone 3 : 73-80 percent is for higher-level aerobic capacity . * zone 4 : 84-90 percent is lactate threshold work and improves your time trialing. * zone 5 : 91-100 percent is for sprints and anaerobic power . " No workouts are called for in the 80-84 percent range . That 's no man 's land  --  too high for the steady tempo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in zone 4 . " Everyone is an individual . " People say that an elevated morning heart rate means you 're overtrained , but I 've seen some of our riders have their best races when their hart rates were 10 percent higher than normal . " Ed Burke Ph.D. , coordinator of Project 96 Instrumental in U.S. cycling success in the ' 84 Los Angeles Olympics , Burke has written about cycling science since ' 77 . Much of his research over the years has been in nutrition and hydration  --  subjects that will be crucial in the heat and humidity of the Atlanta Olympic games . Determine your unique maximum heart rate . Advises Burke : " Most training plans are based on max heart rate see Dean Golich 's tips , so you 'll want an accurate figure . Here 's how to get it : Warm up thoroughly , then on a long steady hill with little traffic , steadily increase effort every minute for 10-12 minutes until you ca n't go any faster . Then sprint . If possible , use a recording heart rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're working at your max . Stay hydrated , because heart rate rises when you 're dehydrated even though power output remains the same . Do n't do the test unless you are rested and have fresh legs . Check with your doctor before you try this test . " Pack in carbo right after riding . " In a study , two groups of cyclists were exercised to exhaustion . One group drank a carbohydrate replacement drink immediately after exercise and the other group waited 2 hours . Analysis of muscle tissue showed that the riders who reloaded immediately after the workout produced muscle glycogen at a rate 50 percent higher than the group that waited . " Get enough carbo . Most cyclists who train hard need 8-10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram 2.2 pounds of body weight to replenish their glycogen stores . To help you calculate your needs , a banana contains 40 grams and a bagel , 50 . " Switch on your metabolism . " Research conducted by John Ivy , Ph.D. , at the University of Texas shows that including some protein in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretion and stimulates uptake of both protein and carbohydrate in muscle cells . These so-called metabolic optimizers such as Opti Fuel II , $33/3 lbs . powder , TwinLab , 800/645-5626 ; Metabolol II , $15/1 lb. powder , Champion Nutrition , 800-863-8629 are being used as a post-ride supplement and experimented with during long events . " Hennie Top U.S. national women 's road coach A leading Dutch rider in the early ' 80s , Top is best known to American cycling fans for her blazing sprint in Colorado 's Coors Classic . She is a master of tactics and strategy . Climb at your own pace . Top 's tip : " Do n't let others dictate your effort . If you are n't a good climber , try to start a long climb at the front of the group and slide gradually to the back as the climb progresses . Maybe you can hang on over the top . Even if you are riding alone , do n't go so hard you blow up halfway up the hill . You wo n't be able to recover on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it up on descents . " Follow an experienced rider , but do n't follow too closely in case he or she makes a mistake and crashes . Also , keep your legs going around so they do n't stiffen up for the next climb . " Jeff Broker Ph.D . U.S. Olympic Committee chief biomechanist Broker is an expert on pedaling mechanics , and pioneered the use of the SRM PowerMeter in the U.S. The SRM measures power output directly on the bike and is instrumental in calculating aerodynamic drag forces for time trialists . Aerodynamics saves more time than smooth pedaling . " It 's a myth that riders pull up at the bottom of the pedal stroke sufficiently to unload the pedal , " Broker contends . " There 's also no scientific evidence that good pedaling mechanics can shave seconds off your time . In fact , lower level cyclists often have better form than elite riders . And our studies show that mountain bikers seem to pull through at the bottom of the pedal stroke better than track and road riders , although we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need uniform power delivery through the whole pedal stroke so they do n't lose traction on loose surfaces . Theoretically , better pedaling techniques should make you a better cyclist , but scientifically it does n't seem to be that important . " Aerodynamics will make you faster than perfect pedaling style . Here 's a great example . Wind tunnel results show that eliminating 10 grams of drag will save 158 feet in a 25-mile time trial . How much is 10 grams ? It 's the drag created by projecting 4.5 inches of a pencil into the airstream . That baggy jersey or upright position is costing you minutes . " Nicholas Torrados M.D. , Ph.D. , ONCE team physician Working with one of Europe 's top pro teams , Torrados is an expert in altitude training . ONCE pioneered scientific training for pro riders , and Torrados takes a mobile lab to every race so he can monitor cyclists throughout the season . Hike before you bike . According to Torrados , " Early season training for the ONCE Team includes one hour of walking in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphill running . This helps condition the legs for the intense cycling training during the season . It is n't traditional for cyclists to hike and run , but we think it 's important . We even do our first performance test of the season running on the treadmill . " Determine you lactate threshold . " Most cyclists do n't have access to lab facilities to determine their lactate threshold . But you can find yours with a 30-minute time trial . The average heart rate you can maintain for the ride  --  about 10 miles  --  is a good working approximation of your lactate threshold . " Training at intensities from 10% below LT to slightly above it will improve your time trialing and overall cycling efficiency . Wolfram Lindner Swiss national cycling coach As the East German road coach , Lindner created one of the most powerful amateur road teams in the world . Although he 's dictatorial and uncompromising in his beliefs , his ready wit enlivens his addresses . Do n't concentrate too much on improving weaknesses . " We work extensively on riders ' strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindner . " But never spend so much time on your weaknesses that you lose your strengths . For instance , we had a great sprinter who suffered with the fourth group on climbs . He worked on climbing all winter , and when racing began , he could climb with the third group . But he could no longer sprint well . " Rest as hard as you train . " Olaf Ludwig rode 26,000 miles in the 12 months before his Olympic victory in ' 88 . But when you train as intensely as we did , you have to rest just as hard . We went to Mexico for 6 weeks of altitude training and when we got back my boss in East Germany looked at all the rest days and said we could have saved money by only staying 4 weeks . He did n't understand the need for rest . " Roy Knickman U.S. national road coach A product of the " class of ' 84 " that included Alexi Grewal and Ron Kiefel , Knickman was a longtime pro with 7-Eleven and Coors Light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . And his advice serves as a refreshingly simple closer to our coaches conference : Do n't worry too much about numbers . " When I was 15 , I had a VO sub 2 max of 72 and was viewed as the next great American rider . Each year after that my VO sub 2 numbers decreased even though my results got better . Right after my bronze medal performance in the ' 84 Olympic team time trial  --  the strongest I 've ever been  --  I was tested again . My max VO sub 2 was 64 . If I 'd had that score when I was 15 , I doubt that I 'd have gotten the attention and opportunities that I did . " <p>
