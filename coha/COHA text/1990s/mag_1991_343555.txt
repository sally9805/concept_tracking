President George Bush calls it " a responsibility imposed by our successes " in the cold war . Columnist Pete Hamill calls it the new world odor . Fleeing Kurds , burying their dead in mountain tent cities , call it misery . <P> Welcome to the new world order . <P> If huddled refugees have become the emblem of his foreign policy , Bush has only himself to blame for giving it a sonorous title with the word new in it . The principles  --  and the problems  --  of the new world order have a long history in American foreign policy  --  or better , foreign policies , since America has traditionally pursued two . The NWO echoes both . <P> The first tradition of American foreign policy , appropriately , is America first . It was often isolationist , as in George Washington 's warning in his Farewell Address against permanent alliances . But it was not necessarily so . ( Washington had been interested in westward expansion since colonial days . ) Our interests might compel us to pick fights ; as America expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we also came to have interests in such things as peace and stability . But we would continue to stay out of fights that did not directly concern us , and our concerns did not automatically include every instance of injustice in the world . <P> Over the years this principle of self-interest was inflected by an idealistic impulse : America as leader and light of the world . We associate this with the crusading spirit of the World Wars and the cold war , but it too goes further back . The Spanish-American War began not only to remember the Maine but to cleanse Cuba of Spanish concentration camps . Earlier still , there were Americans who wanted to aid Hungarian rebels against the Habsburgs or Greek rebels against the Ottomans . <P> Both impulses have shared a very American respect for legalistic thinking  --  not surprisingly , since so many American diplomats were Wasp lawyers . They searched , as George Kennan put it , for " formal criteria of a juridical nature by which the permissible behavior of states could be defined . " The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search , even as it made the rest of the world baffling to us . " To the American mind , " Kennan added , it was " implausible that people should have positive aspirations more important to them than the peacefulness and orderliness of international life . " Still , whether we were being hardheaded or softhearted , we put our faith in rules , since both our power and the world 's happiness seemed to benefit from them . <P> The gulf war , the first crisis of Bush 's NWO , was in fact a display case for the weaknesses and the strengths of typical American behavior . Our pussyfooting diplomacy before the invasion of Kuwait was intended to be a simple lawyerly proposition . Because we wanted to be honest brokers , we assured Saddam that we had no position on the precise location of the Iraq- Kuwait border . The only problem with our offer was that Saddam , who is not a Wasp lawyer , took it to mean that we did n't care whether there was an Iraq- Kuwait border .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
