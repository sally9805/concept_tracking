How American economics is hurting Polish capitalism <p> A visitor arrives at the Warsaw airport with well-formed expectations , and at first Poland does n't disappoint . The customs agent is dressed in an army-surplus-style uniform too big around the waist , and the clutter behind the baggage claim counter brings to mind the office at a refrigerator repair shop . The general ambience resembles a Worcester , Massachusetts airfield circa 1957 . <p> The outskirts of Warsaw offer more along this line . Weathered old folks , like peasants in elementary social studies texts , pedal ancient bicycles along the main road . There are cabbage fields and nondescript structures where in America the shopping centers and Burger Kings would be . A power plant belches smoke in the distance , and everything seems tired and gray like an old house going to seed . <p> It 's easy to see how visiting journalists , traversing the route from airport to Holiday Inn and going on to the offices of politicians and intellectuals , could imbibe this view . In truth , the sorry state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when their own economic problems were getting out of hand . <p> On this particular trip , however , our host drove a little further , to a town called Milanowek about 20 miles outside Warsaw . I was there at the invitation of an American environmentalist and small businessman named Hank Ryan , who has initiated a sister cities program between Milanowek and his own hometown of Winstead , Connecticut . A former country retreat for wealthy Warsawites , Milanowek today is a combination suburb and small factory town , with truck ( actually horse ) farms on the fringe . It is quite comfortable by Polish standards . But it has no sewers and many dirt roads , plus a huge debt that the old communist government left behind . To an American , it seems a hamlet that time passed by . <p> A week in Milanowek hardly qualifies me as an expert on Poland . But what I saw there suggests some significant gaps in the press reports coming back to the American public . For one thing , Poland has a lot of private entrepreneurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers ' markets in Warsaw that the press has been doting on as the harbingers of a Capitalist Spring . Many did quite well under the communists . But they kept quiet for the most part , giving rise to a kind of reverse Potemkin Village effect in which things seemed poorer than they actually were . <p> Now these entrepreneurs face a new challenge : the measures designed  --  at the urging of American economists  --  to thrust Poland headlong into a free-market economy . So confident in their theoretical models and their top-down prescriptions , these economists do n't seem to know or care very much about the entrepreneurs who actually comprise the market they purport to create . <p> The second point is more elusive but no less important : Economics has become virtually the only lens through which we view developments in the former East Bloc . There 's a great deal about Poland , and especially a town like Milanowek , that does n't show up in the GNP . Family ties are strong . People eat at home , their foods often grown locally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People still read . Boom boxes do n't disrupt the parks . Shopping malls have n't replaced the traditional town center , which reinforces a sense of social cohesion and community . <p> There are no billboards , no neon , no carry-out ; the shops are marked only by nondescript signs . Despite myself , I felt at first restless and deprived . No place to go for coffee and a bagel , not even a Hershey bar . As the days passed , I began to feel unburdened and relaxed . If time stopped in the fifties in Poland , then a town like this is the good side . <p> To a Western economist , though , such things look like poverty and underdevelopment ; when people sit around the family dinner table instead of going to McDonald 's and a movie , there is no cash transaction , little for the GNP . Yet the family dinner table represents a kind of cohesion that Americans are groping to recover . In some ways , Poland is ahead for being behind . <p> This is true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffering and oppression that has helped them tolerate hard economic measures with relatively little wailing and self-pity . Under the free market crash program , they have endured a drop in purchasing power of somewhere between 30 and 40 percent . In the U.S. , by contrast , wealthy Americans have conniptions at the possibility of a tax increase of some 2 or 3 percent . Their idea of a sacrifice is a capital gains tax cut . <p> This may sound patronizing , but at least some Poles think about these things , and wonder just how much of the American model they actually want . " Most people in Poland do n't realize that they have very good things apart from the political and economic problems , " says Andrzej Moes , Milanowek entreprenuer and chairman of the newly elected town council . " We are not so spoiled by industry , commerce , and technology . We have more calm living . " What strikes an American is how little our economics has to offer in terms of social cohesion , beyond the rudiments of stoking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American economists qualify even on that limited ground these days . ) Questions such as what makes a town livable , what makes families close  --  we might well be seeking advice from the residents of Milanowek , rather than them seeking it from us . " Poles have a chance to ask basic questions that we stopped asking long ago , " says Andrew Golebiowski , director of the Polish Municipal Training Programs for Sister Cities International . Lifestyles of the rich and Polish <p> Most of the homes in Milanowek lie behind heavy gates . This is tradition , but that the gates are often closed shows , I was told , a growing concern about crime . Poland 's free-market tonic has brought rising prices and  --  for the first time in memory  --  unemployment . ( Previously , everyone had jobs , though many did n't have work . ) One widow in Milanowek keeps a stun gun on her kitchen table . <p> Such precautions seem a bit exaggerated even for a visitor from New York City . Milanowek is a quiet and almost idyllic place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go to shop or catch the train . Elderly couples , as well as mothers and children , pedal along on fat-tired bikes , net shopping bags over the handlebars . <p> Until recently , the shop buildings belonged to the state , so the commercial presence is muted . It can take days to realize how many stores there are in town . There are Sam Spozywczy ( " serve yourself food " ) stores in all the neighborhoods , a kind of state-owned 7-11 for bread and basics . The town center has everything from a large garden supply store to an inchoate boutique . ( The latter was one of the few signs of a youth culture . Another was graffiti in the tunnel under the railroad tracks , stating in English , " Skateboarding is not a crime . " ) A small bakery offers homemade ice cream at seven cents a scoop . The lines at the butcher shops were no longer than what Americans encounter at supermarkets and discount drug stores . They were much more civil . <p> If the iron gate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater one was the house behind . Built last year , it was a modem chateau-style structure that would have stood proudly in Potomac , Virginia , or Lincoln , Massachusetts . From press accounts , I had braced myself for a week on a cot in a crowded kitchen . Yet here I was in a private guest room with pink curtains and a bowl of fruit and bottled water on the dresser . The kitchen was done in hand carpentry , with bright red utensils and matching TV . There were two more TVs downstairs , and a fourth in the daughter 's room upstairs . <p> The explanation for this relative affluence was an old shed out back . From the street , it looked like a place for rusted oil drums , the Gasoline Alley that Americans expect in Poland . Yet at about 7:30 a.m. , two or three workers appeared quietly at my host 's gate and went to work in the shed . They were skilled machinists , and inside were machines with which they made bearings for use in Fiats manufactured in Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my host built his house last year . That was when the communists finally fell from power . Suddenly , it was okay to show what you had . ( Previously , people tended to spend on interiors . ) <p> Strangely , communist Poland had come to replicate what John Kenneth Galbraith observed about American capitalism : private wealth amid public poverty . I learned that Milanowek is bustling with cottage businesses , enough to have a small chamber of commerce . My host , an animated man named Stanislaw Cwiklinski , was a prototypical small entrepreneur  --  constantly in motion , on the phone in his basement office at all hours of the day and night . He spoke no English , however , so for an explanation of how such private business took hold in a communist nation , I asked Andrzej Moes . <p> Moes lives in a modem one-story house he designed himself , set back from the road behind a cluster of trees . A couple of good-natured sheepdogs patrol the front drive . With his curly thatch of hair , California shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee in Marin County . Instead , he is a textile entrepreneur , and he just opened a little workshop making running suits ( which he also designed himself ) with the Milanowek town shield on the chest . <p> Moes is unfailingly considerate and polite , to the point of embarrassment , given his schedule . He was recently elected chairman of the new Milanowek town council , which has the job of digging out after 45 years of communist cronyism and bad management . The previous night he was in Warsaw until very late , discussing a new banking system and questions of foreign investment . It 's easy for American economists to preach a " cold turkey " plunge into capitalism . But the job of doing it is falling to people like Moes , and he 's getting worn to a frazzle . His business is straggling as he spends almost all his time on town affairs . " There are too many things to be done at once , " he says . <p> The Polish communists were not orthodox Marxists . Rather , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party clique ran everything . They got the best government jobs and the best private businesses and " joint ventures " as well . Others could start small businesses , but only in " difficult and twisting ways , " Moes says . Getting a workshop and raw materials , for example , taxed ingenuity since there were no established channels . The effort also put one constantly at the mercy of the authorities , because everything was illegal : " There were limits on earning , " Moe says , " even if you worked all day and all night . You had to hide part of the income and pay part of your salaries under the table . One was forced to cheat on the taxes . To hide turnover . To hide the real salaries of employees . " <p> By looking the other way , the authorities turned private enterprise into a means of social control . Everybody knew about the cheating , Moes says , " even people from the Ministry of Finance . It was unofficially official . That was the aim of the communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government could say I know but I do n't draw the consequences as long as you are for us . ' " Such memories lie behind one of the hottest political debates in Poland right now  --  how quickly to get rid of the old nomenklatura , the party elite now in a position to set themselves up in the newly privatizing industries . Sweating equity <p> Beyond the appearance of fancy houses around Milanowek , the other big change has been the introduction of a program designed to plunge Poland into a free-market economy . Though any number of Western advisers have had a hand in this program , the one who has gotten the most attention is Jeffrey Sachs , the globe-trotting whiz kid from Harvard . Sachs preaches a kind of macro-economic machismo . Raise prices , hike interest rates , welcome bankruptcies and unemployment as evidence that the fat of the communist years is sweating off the body economic . " Western observers should not over-dramatize layoffs and bankruptcies , " Sachs wrote in The Economist back in January . " Poland , like the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . " <p> Cruel as it sounds , Sachs is right , up to a point . The communists did pad the payrolls shamelessly , so that state-owned enterprises employed many thousands of people they did n't need . But that raises a lot of questions , one of which is whether it 's enough to sweat off the fat without taking care of the muscle . Sachs may be laying the groundwork to attract foreign investment . But what about the local entrepreneurs ? Americans supposedly learned from In Search of Excellence and its progeny that a healthy economy begins with healthy firms . But people who know how to manage and produce  --  **26;148;TOOLONG types  --  do n't have much cachet in editorial boardrooms and on Nobel Prize committees . So it is the macro-whizzes who hold sway in the national and international debates . <p> The results are evident in Poland . Having survived the communists , local entrepreneurs face a new problem in the cold-turkey measures urged by people like Sachs . A major point of concern in Milanowek , for example , is utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for commercial rates and 100 percent for residential . The old subsidized rates may have encouraged waste , but this kind of sudden increase undermines the cost structure of fragile local businesses . Greenhouses , a major form of private enterprise in Poland , will be hit especially hard . So will Richard Puch , who stone-washes dungarees in a small factory in Milanowek . The factory uses a lot of electricity for washing and drying , and Puch is n't sure he 's going to make it through the winter heating season . <p> But people like Puch are not complaining . There 's a remarkable lack of self-pity in this country ; politics have not devolved into the kind of self-interest grabfest that Poles associate with the U.S. What these small businesses do want is practical advice on how to save energy . " Puch knows he needs to conserve , but no one locally knows how to help him , " says Joel Gordes , a Connecticut state legislator and conservation consultant who was in Milanowek recently , meeting with local entrepreneurs . " There was a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It turns out that there are lots of things Puch could do . He could recapture moist heat from the hot washing water , for example , and run it through a heat exchanger to help heat the dryer . Efficient new motors would pay for themselves many times over , if he could raise the capital to buy them . " This is really simple stuff for us , " Gordes says . " but nobody was there to tell him . " Economists assume that given the correct price " signals , " conservation will appear by spontaneous generation . But like most things it requires investment , know-how , tools that wo n't simply appear if nobody makes them available . What economists tout as " market-clearing " prices may clear the market of entrepreneurs . <p> Gordes was in Poland with Hank Ryan , who is trying to show on a small scale how Americans can provide such tools for Polish economic self-help . His idea is to help Milanowek manufacturers market their products in the U.S. , with his share of the profit going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought Gordes and another local conservation specialist over there to do energy audits of local businesses and to brief local utility officials on peak-load pricing and similar strategies . They explained how the utility could save money ( and cut pollution ) by helping entrepreneurs like Puch finance new motors instead of adding generating capacity to the plant . <p> At a meeting of the local craft council , businessmen expressed enthusiasm for the idea . They pressed Ryan for videos explaining conservation techniques and began discussing the possibility of converting their own small factories  --  ones that turn out plastic toys , for example  --  to making weather stripping and insulation . If the U.S. government were to take such initiatives on a larger scale  --  through a kind of Conservation Peace Corps , perhaps  --  it could genuinely help free enterprise take root in Eastern Europe and win the lasting gratitude of entrepreneurs there . This would also help Eastern Europe reduce pollution , which is a major health problem and an obstacle to developing new industries . Unfortunately , the Reagan and Bush administrations have pooh-poohed conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Middle East crisis are now preventing us from promoting free enterprise in the East Bloc . " Dynasty " dementia <p> Andrzej Moes had every reason to become a National Review hero  --  the kind of asocial , acquisitive Ayn Rand character that the right-wing press imagines rising out of the ashes of communism . More than 70 years of communist thuggery hang heavily over his living room . On one wall is his grandmother , who fought the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine in 1917 ; their property was taken , her husband died . On another wall is his other grandfather , who lost his land to the Russians after World War II . From landed nobility they were reduced to wandering " nomads " until they settled in Milanowek in the late 1940s . <p> Yet today , Moes speaks quietly , without the distemper common among anticommunists in the U.S. Even though he is a businessman , he does not see the fall of communism solely in terms of investment opportunity and gain . The communists gave greed a bad name in Poland , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't care about other people . " Freedom , by contrast , means the freedom to do right , not just to make money . Moes has thrown himself into the task of rebuilding from the rubble . The priorities for the new Milanowek council include sewers and low-income housing . " This is a time when people who were against the communist system should do something for the country , " he says . <p> Moes represents a side of Poland not much reported in the American press : anticommunist , pro-free market , but not obsessed with economics in the manner of American free marketeers . In this sense , Poland brings out the fault line in American right-wing thought between traditional family and community values on the one hand and the aggressive market culture that tends to undermine them on the other . <p> This is not to downplay the appeal of a market economy . A theme heard over and over , in 50 different ways , is how the Communists destroyed the connection between effort and reward . " It is a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and member of the Milanowek council . " People expect that somebody will give them something . People expect that the town management will give them a flat , will give them work . " Poles tend to idealize America on this point , as a land where rewards are dealt strictly on the basis of effort and worth . Their leaders worry that euphoric economists are creating the impression that the market is a magic carpet to prosperity and ease . The " Dynasty " reruns in the late afternoon perpetuate this belief . " ' Dynasty ' does n't show how hard the guy has to work , " says Gregg Lindenberg , manager of Warsaw Gazetta , the popular new Warsaw daily that is aligned with the anti-Walesa faction of Solidarity . " Probably he has been working 14 hours a day 6 days a week for 20 years . This part Poles do n't understand . Americans probably understand it . " <p> Americans also understand , of course , that the guy might have been living off oil royalties and not have done a stitch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poles are attracted to the idealized version . " I want to make a lot of money , " Lindenberg told an interviewer recently . A former Solidarity activist , Lindenberg was imprisoned during martial law in the early eighties . As Solidarity evolved from a socially minded labor organization into a broad-based movement , free-market thinking became its intellectual edge . <p> The American left needs to grasp the exhilaration , the anti-establishment quality , that free-market thinking holds for people like Lindenberg . But the right needs to grasp that there is more to this than Milton Friedman . Much of the appeal of " the market " today is metaphoric . It represents a routing of the system in which the communists jiggered everything , in which hypocrisy pervaded the whole society . The truth about anything  --  history , the economy , one 's own business-could n't be spoken , was conducted off the books . Today , people speak of the old regulated prices for such things as food and utilities as " dishonest " rather than , as economists do , " inefficient . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know much about this thing called " the market " in concrete particulars . " We want capitalist relations here but we do n't know what this is , " one Milanowek resident told me . In particular , there is a good deal of naivete on the political dimensions of capitalism  --  on the role of advertisers in influencing the press , for example , and on the political power of corporations . ( Poles have a sophisticated grasp of certain points of similarity between communism and capitalism , however . A current TV ad is pitching a conference center to Western businessmen ; the ad ends with a well-endowed young lady , wearing nothing at all , slipping playfully into bed . ) <p> Andrzej Stepnik of Milanowek illustrates the leavening effect of Polish culture on free-market views . Stepnik is a square-shouldered former merchant seaman who shipped out because , as he puts it , speaking of the communists , " I hated those guys . " Like many talented Poles , he returned when Solidarity began to inspire hope for the future . Today he can sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " You only need a garden tool to rake it in . " <p> Yet Stepnik also has a social awareness that does not always accompany such views in the U.S. He is an organic gardener , for example , whose wife makes natural pesticides by boiling certain plants . He talks about the need for zoning and land-use controls in town and warns that the " sharks " are starting to circle Poland for financial killings . And he is an environmentalist . " You wo n't find people so hungry for money that they will agree to any monkey business , " he says of probable pressure on Poland to relax environmental laws to attract new business . Pollution is a problem that Poles associate with the communist bosses ; and , in a strange twist , Ralph Nader and the Sierra Club , by housebreaking the American corporation somewhat , have done much to make capitalism attractive to the former East Bloc . " Foreign investment has much stricter ecological standards , " Lindenberg says , explaining why Poland should court American business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempers free-market fundamentalism . Poles know they need money from outside , along with the business culture and marketing savvy that comes with it . But attach to the economist 's neutered term " capital " the name of the actual places from which that investment is likely to come and complications arise . Germany is the prime example . The thought does not rest comfortably on the Polish mind that Germany might now be able to accomplish with marks what it failed to do with tanks . The thought is especially galling because at today 's depressed prices , Poland could be bought for a song . " People in government must be very careful not to let foreign money overwhelm us and dominate us , " Moes says . ( Poles seem to prefer the Russians to the Germans as the lesser of two evils . ) Poles apart <p> Free-market ideology stresses the impersonal relationship of contracts . Life is a succession of deals , all to maximize personal benefit . In Poland , which is still largely rural , life tends towards the personal . Family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could speak the truth . ( Andrzej Moes attributes his political independence to having learned " right history " at home . ) The rituals of food preparation and eating still revolve almost entirely around the home . People do n't go out for a quick bite because there 's no place to go . At the offices of Warsaw Gazetta , there are no styrofoam containers and sandwich wrappers on the desks ; people get a full-fledged Polish dinner at a kitchen down the hall . <p> Poles who visit the U.S. sometimes feel adrift in a world in which people relate more to work and to things than to each other . Lila Szoszuk , a retired resident of Milanowek , spent three months with her brother in the Chicago area in 1983 . " I think I ca n't live in America , " she says . " They have not the time to arrange for me a trip . He work all the time . He was tired . " ( Mrs. Szoszuk was also put off by Americans ' attachment to their cars . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go only by car . " ) Gregg Lindenberg noted the same thing . During two years in America , he says , " I never made a real American friend . I made people who are called , in America , ' friend . ' " <p> This is not to understate the fascination with things American . Even a little town like Milanowek has a " Cafe Royal Bar , " a cozy little nook with three tables and American cigarette posters on the wall . ( Smoking seems to be Poland 's national sport , and a potentially large leakage of foreign exchange to the coffers of R.J. Reynolds et al . RJR recently bought an East German cigarette maker . ) In Warsaw , " California " lodi ( ice cream ) seems to have the cachet that Italian gelato has here . At the Sam Spozywczy store at a Warsaw apartment complex , the single biggest display was for Coca-Cola . ( Though the biggest line , at noontime , was at the liquor counter . ) <p> For all this , most Milanowek residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , life is easier here . The phones work . There 's enough toilet paper . ( Although modest expectations bring their own rewards . " When I buy toilet paper I am happy , " one woman said . " I have a good day . " ) People organize their own lives without the guiding hand of the state . But in terms of family , friendship , things not encompassed in the economic sphere , they do n't want to lose what they have . <p> Adam Brostek , a journalist with the state television network , reflects this ambivalence . Brostek is starting an independent local paper in Milanowek , called Nasza , which means " Our . " He and his partner are doing it Ben Franklin style , using a printing business for financial support . He helped the new town council defeat the communist slate by publishing candidate profiles for the respective voting districts . He has hopes for a local radio station , possibly even TV . Still , he worries about the cultural disruptions that an American-style economy might bring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle  --  being close with my friends and family and culture , " he says . " It is in my blood . " <p> Brostek lives with his wife and her parents in a small apartment building in Milanowek . Though the space is n't bad by New York standards  --  plumbing excepted  --  most American writers in their mid-thirties would find such an arrangement stifling . Brostek does n't . <p> The old Marxist critique of capitalism warned of poverty , unemployment , social insecurity , and so forth . What worries Brostek , by contrast , is time . Poles should work harder but not the way Americans do . " We have plenty of time , " he observes . " My home . My friends . My garden . Now I must work 16 hours a day ? " <p> As we talked , we were watching Brostek 's news show on a color TV set . Polish TV news is of surprisingly high quality , more literate and reflective than the American network version . The camera lingers on scenes without the jumpy , quick-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( People told me that the reporting is generally free of government tilt . ) Then a series of the new American-style ads appeared . One was for dungarees : the familiar motorcycles , black leather , and hips . <p> I could n't help thinking that Poland may be in for a generation gap that makes the American sixties version seem paltry . Much as American parents of the fifties saw the world through the lens of the Depression and World War II , Polish parents and grandparents today remember Hitler , Stalin , and the hardship of the past 45 years . Some think the collective memory is too strong for economic changes to dislodge . " In Poland the rich and the poor are no different , " Lila Szoszuk says . " In the U.S. when you have a lot of money , you like only the people who have the same money . My father was very rich . After the war he was very , very poor . For me money is nothing . " <p> " Our television is not for joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about the world . " The teenagers who soak up " Dynasty " in the afternoon may have different notions , however . One , the daughter of a fairly prosperous businessman , commented , " We do n't have enough . " <p> In the end I felt in Milanowek not the euphoric free-market utopianism of The Wall Street Journal editorial page but rather a kind of fatalism ; the market , like democracy , is n't ideal , only the least bad . " You can expect that we know all these bad things . The intelligent people think about that , the Americanization of our culture , " Jacek Gutowski says . " But all these things  --  Coca-Cola , McDonald 's  --  are near to our feelings . They are a little piece of freedom . " <p> They were once so for Americans too , of course , and there 's no reason to expect Poles to be any different , especially considering the dark night they 've come through . It seems a long , long way in Milanowek before McDonald 's becomes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the easy sociability of Warszawska , the main shopping street ; before power lawnmowers turn Saturday mornings into an aural nightmare ; and before a youth culture , prompted by the marketing needs of business , drives a wedge between parents and their kids . When you do n't even have sewers , how are you going to begin to address such prospects anyway ? <p> Well , there may be a few things you can do . The town council is working on a zoning plan , for example , that could protect the traditional shopping district . More important than the plan are the values that lie beneath it . " People organized in your way are separate from one another , " council chairman Moes says . " Here people are forced to lead a social life , to have contacts . " <p> " We have poor people , " he continues , " but still in Poland many people do n't put together the problems of life and the problems of money . In the U.S. people are accustomed to relate all problems to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . " <p> But Moes , like others , is fatalistic . The market , he says , " will bring both sides , good and bad as well . It is impossible to block the bad influence . I hope the good influence will be the majority .
