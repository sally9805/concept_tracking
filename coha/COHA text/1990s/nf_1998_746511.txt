All rational liberal philosophic positions have lost their significance and power . . . . I am afraid that we shall have to make a very great effort in order to find a solid basis for rational liberalism . Only a great thinker could help us in our intellectual plight . But here is the great trouble : the only great thinker in our time is Heidegger.  --  Leo Strauss , " An Introduction to Heideggerian " Existentialism " <p> <p> The American interpretation of Americanism by means of pragmatism still remains outside the metaphysical realm .  --  Heidegger , " The Age of the World Picture " <p> <p> Tocqueville 's reputation as a friend , albeit a cautious and critical friend , of democracy as he saw it emerging in America has generally overshadowed any awareness of the depth of his reservations concerning the new order . A heightened appreciation of the stakes of Tocqueville 's choice in favor of democracy might provide a useful example to contemporary philosophy as it attempts to situate itself in relation to a social order that appears now , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overwhelm all rivals . " RELIGIOUS TERROR " AND NIHILISM <p> " The whole book before you , " Tocqueville observes in the introduction to Democracy in America , " has been written under the impression of a kind of religious terror produced in the author 's soul by the sight of this irresistible revolution . . . . " ( n1 ) What is the meaning of this " religious terror ? " <p> It is clear that Tocqueville uses the term democracy to name not a political regime in the traditional sense ( since it embraces the possibility of different political forms , despotic as well as democratic ) but a deep transformation of human thought and society sweeping through the West , or as Tocqueville writes , through " the Christian world " ( 11,12 ) . A close reading of Tocqueville 's account of that transformation , already 700 years in the works , reveals a deep if paradoxical continuity between the Christian interpretation of human inequality in the light of radical transcendence ( according to which human superiority is ultimately referred to a God who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern assertion of " the natural greatness of man , " a greatness attributed to humanity as a whole and therefore , ultimately , to no human beings in particular or concretely. ( n2 ) Such a greatness , having eschewed all particular , conventional , or broadly " aristocratic " interpretations of rank , is left with no content other than the material interests shared by all human beings . That content , however , does not bear the full weight of the question of meaning , since that question is perpetually deferred through the notion of progress . Thus the absorption by a radically transcendent God of all ultimately meaningful differences of rank among human beings produces an interpretation of ultimate meaning that is indefinitely " progressive " in its form and naturalistic and humanitarian in its effectual content. ( n3 ) <p> The absorption and liquidation of traditional " aristocratic " sources of meaning , prepared by the Christian radicalization of transcendence and carried out under the banner of modern progress , or " the natural greatness of man , " is at the heart of Tocqueville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of traditional hierarchies implies the abolition of " all the laws of moral analogy " ; " the natural link between opinions and tastes , acts and beliefsO ( 16 ) ; or the disruption of the heretofore normal harmony between human endeavor and human understandings of the way things are , or of the order of the whole . From the first age in which the radicalization of transcendence put in question that normal harmony , a dynamic is released in which nobility or excellence works against itself , progressively contributing to its own subversion and eventual abolition . This is the dynamic that first comes fully to light in the paroxysms of the French Revolution and its aftermath , in which " one often meets naturally proud and noble men whose opinions are in direct opposition to their tastes , " and where " others . . . speak of freedom as if they could feel its great and sacred quality and noisily claim for humanity rights which they themselves have always scorned " ( 17 ) . <p> This , then , is the meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable " intellectual conditions ( 16 ) that inspire in Tocqueville a religious terror or dread . Tocqueville fears that the absorption of meanings once experienced as inherent in one version or another of traditional hierarchy by the idealistic interpretation of material progress portends the emergence of a new world in which " nothing is connected . . . where nothing any longer seems either forbidden or permitted , honest or dishonorable , true or false " ( 18 ) . ( n4 ) <p> The philosophical critique of modernity in the later nineteenth and the twentieth century has provided a name for what Tocqueville dreads : nihilism . Indeed , it is striking how far Tocqueville 's reflections on the " democratic " future anticipate later and ( at least politically ) more radical responses to modern equality . Consider , most notably , the surprising kinship between Tocqueville 's " religious terror " and Martin Heidegger 's account of the nihilism of modernity . Heidegger warns , for example , that " the spiritual decline of the earth is so far advanced that the nations are in danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to see the decline , " a decline that he describes as " the darkening of the world , the flight of the gods , the destruction of the earth , the transformation of men into a mass , the hatred and suspicion of everything free and creative . " ( n5 ) If one were to review each of the five elements of this characterization of spiritual exhaustion or nihilism in the latter part of that passage from Heidegger 's Introduction to Metaphysics , a familiar reader of Democracy in America might recognize clear correlates for each in Tocqueville 's foreboding regarding the leveling undercurrent of democracy. ( n6 ) <p> Of course there can be no question of simply identifying Heidegger 's account of nihilism with Tocqueville 's response to democracy . What I mean to suggest is that we can not fully appreciate the quite conspicuous differences between the two authors until we have gauged the profound sense in which they share a common concern with nihilism and , indeed to a considerable degree , a common analysis of its dynamics . <p> Most striking in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying dynamic of modernity that Heidegger would later discuss in terms of " the metaphysics of subjectivity . " A century before " The Question Concerning Technology , " Tocqueville revealed the deep connection between what Heidegger would call man 's self-exaltation as supreme subject or " lord of the earth " and his debasement as mere object or " standing-reserve. " ( n7 ) It is in fact in a destructive collusion between mastery and debasement that Tocqueville locates the deepest springs of the nihilistic disruption of the normal or traditional harmony between theory and practice . Tocqueville 's insight into this destructive paradox is clear , for example , in his discussion " Some Characteristics Peculiar to Historians in Democratic Centuries " ; he observes that historians " pride themselves " on proving that men are not free . " In their writings the author figures large , but humanity is always tiny " ( 496 ) . But Tocqueville 's most brilliant and incisive reference to this dynamic of mastery and debasement is certainly the epigram by which he rebukes those intellectuals , broadly described as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " champions of modern civilization " ( 17 ) : " When they think they have sufficiently established that they are no better than brutes , they seem as proud as if they had proved that they were gods " ( 544 ) . ( n8 ) <p> It is clear , moreover , that for Tocqueville this characteristic of historians is not an isolated trait of a certain class of intellectuals but rather one expression of a deep and pervasive tendency of the emerging new world , a world in which " writer and public join in corrupting each other " ( 488 ) . One might then say that the advance of democracy toward nihilism is most adequately described neither as primarily an intellectual movement nor as a social movement but , to speak like Heidegger , as conditioned by an orientation of man toward Being , an orientation more primordial than the conventional distinction between theory and practice . MODERN PHILOSOPHY AND DEMOCRATIC NIHILISM <p> Like Heidegger , ( n9 ) Tocqueville regards the philosophy of Descartes as central to the rise of the pervasive tendency to elevate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to objectivity and , eventually , nothingness . Though Americans are in a way the least theoretical of modern peoples , it does not follow that theory is irrelevant in understanding them , for " the people of the United States almost all have a uniform method and rules for the conduct of intellectual inquiries . " Indeed , America is the country in which " the precepts of Descartes , " though " least studied , " are " best followed " ( 429 ) . <p> In Tocqueville 's account Descartes represents an intellectual disposition encompassing Luther , Bacon , and Voltaire , as well as the American mind . What all the authors mentioned represent ( in varying degrees ) is a wish to be liberated from habits , prejudices , traditions , and orthodoxies through a commitment " to seek by themselves and in themselves for the only reason for things " ( 429 ) , with confidence that " nothing passes beyond the limits of intelligence . " Such a method promises to pierce through the veil of mere " means , " " forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to accede to " results " and to " the basis of things . . . in broad daylight " ( 430 ) . <p> The most direct practical meaning of the Cartesian orientation toward the world is , simply , revolution , in the sense given the word by the French revolutionaries : They " turned the world upside down " by proposing to attack " all ancient things " to pave the way for " everything newO ( 431 ) . The destructive blindness of the modern democratic mode of thought emerges clearly from that simple formulation : The method is effective in identifying the ancient enemies but not in conceiving genuine possibilities ; it seems to issue a blank check to the " new " but in practice issues only negativity . This destructive blindness is at the heart of the " alarming spectacle " of a rupture between theory and practice presented by " the Christian nations of our day , " which Tocqueville described in his introduction to the first volume of Democracy in America . <p> Tocqueville 's awareness of the theoretical character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Ancien Regime and the Revolution. ( n10 ) The violent excesses of the revolutionaries were not , in his view , accidental , but rather direct consequences of the revolutionaries ' attack on religion , in which " the human spirit entirely lost its foundation " ( ARR , 252 ) . The violence was the result of a prior intellectual revolution that aimed to " substitute simple and elementary rules , derived from reason and natural law , for complex and traditional customs " ( ARR , 230 ) . A rational philosophy based on " human nature itself " ( ARR , 70 ) must supplant religion and tradition as the foundation of society . But that universalizing theory , under whose banner the revolutionary proponents of liberty marched , in fact had no place for liberty ( ARR , part 3 , iii ) . The universalism of the skeptical Enlightenment was thus purchased at the cost of a conception of the dignity of humanity . The tragedy of the French Revolution is the dislocation between its generous , high-minded , and public-spirited appeal to liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is couched . <p> The prospects for democracy were more hopeful for the Americans ( who " attained democracy without the sufferings of a democratic revolution " and so " were born equal instead of becoming so " 509 ) than for the revolutionary French . But it is clear that for Tocqueville the destructive pretensions of modern theory are very much a threat in the new world . Tocqueville flatly contradicts those Cartesian-American pretensions when he states that " it can never happen that there are no dogmatic beliefs , that is to say , opinions which men take on trust without discussion " ( 433 ) . Americans ' rejection of traditional sources of authority thus threatens to end not in liberating men but in " giving slavery a new face " ( 436 ) , the face of mass public opinion , and a " new mistress , " which " by some mighty pressure of the mind of all upon the intelligence of each imposes its ideas and makes them penetrate men 's very souls " ( 435 ) . <p> Tocqueville 's language in the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Exercised by the Majority in America over Thought . " There Tocqueville describes a democratic threat to human dignity more powerful than traditional despotism . Whereas the old despot " to reach the soul , clumsily struck at the body , and the soul , escaping from such blows , rose gloriously above it , " the new tyranny " leaves the body alone and goes straight for the soul " ( 255 ) . To understand the gravity of Tocqueville 's concern with this new tyranny , it is important to note , as Pierre Manent has written , " that the phenomenon that he is looking to describe is not a democratic variant of eternal conformity , " ( n11 ) that is , the conformity that exists in all societies . Rather , the collapse of the hierarchical articulation of traditional ( Tocqueville writes , " aristocratic " ) society means the dissolution of all particular or individual social influences . Thus " the very matrix of the influence that one man has over another  --  whether it be that of reason or virtue ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " individual " liberated from the bonds of deference to traditional social influences has no more confidence in his own judgments than in those of any other particular person or group or institution , and so effective authority is transferred increasingly to some abstract third ( public opinion , the state , historical necessity ) . Manent explains : <p> Separated from the influences of another , democratic man has no access to the things themselves , because to know things , a person has to go outside himself , and this is something only one 's better can teach . The changes in the relations of men change the relations of men to things . ( TND , 40 ) <p> Clearly , Tocqueville 's apprehension regarding the apparently irresistible march of democracy is far from narrowly political , or for that matter simply " social " or " moral . " He is concerned , rather , with a radical transformation in the orientation of human beings toward reality , and therefore with a threat to the very meaning of being human . I will not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point : <p> The ultimate presupposition of the majoritarian idea is that what is the most just lies with the idea of the strongest . This very thing by which democratic men resemble each other more and more , this very thing through which they think and perceive themselves , this very thing that is dearer and more intimate than themselves , is nothing human . They can only think it and represent it to themselves in positing it as outside themselves , an irresistible force that pushes and calls to them , a power so much more penetrating than it would be were it their own : the necessity of history , mass power without limit , the irresistible grip of society . ( TND , 44 ) <p> For Tocqueville the collapse of all hierarchy into a homogeneous social mass signifies the collapse of all sense of truth , all orientation toward a reality other than the common or average perception  --  a perception that , because it has no anchor beyond the mass , can only be understood in terms of the greatest power . The deepest revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an abstract , inhuman power . <p> Is Tocqueville 's " religious terror " not , then , akin to Heidegger 's concern about the problem he calls " technology " ? <p> As soon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man even as object , but does so , rather , exclusively as standing-reserve , and man in the midst of objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve , then he comes to the very brink of a precipitous fall ; that is , he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve . Meanwhile man , precisely as the one so threatened , exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth . In this way the impression comes to prevail that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his construct . . . as though man everywhere and always encounters only himself . . . . In truth , however , precisely nowhere does man today any longer encounter himself , i.e. , his essence . . . . " ( n12 ) BEING VERSUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious as soon as we compare their views on America . For Heidegger , James Ceaser has observed , " America represents the greatest alienation of man , his profoundest loss of authenticity , and his furthest distance from Being . " ( n13 ) The essence of Americanism derives , moreover , from the rationalism of the European Enlightenment . " It is the not yet fully understood variant of the still unfolding and not yet full or completed metaphysical essence of the emerging monstrousness of modern times . " The monstrousness consists in a radical homelessness , in the eclipse of all poetic and meditative thinking by the power of mere instrumental information and a consumerist fixation on replaceable commodities. ( n14 ) <p> Heidegger reformulates a long European tradition of contempt for American philistinism and vulgarity in the context of a radically original history of metaphysics ; now American vulgarity is seen as the last stage of a process of decadence that began with the Platonic Ideas and devolved fatefully through the Christian theological representation of divinity to Cartesian subjectivity , only to slide finally into the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought or technology culminates  --  equally , one might say  --  in the American founding , the Communist terror , and the policy of the Final Solution . " ( n15 ) <p> To react to the grotesque disproportion of such a remark by dismissing Heidegger 's horror regarding the reduction of thought to technology would be to ignore concerns shared by as important a friend of democracy as Tocqueville . I suggest , rather , that we reconsider Tocqueville in order to address the question of how a full awareness of the ultimate exhaustion of modern rationalism in nihilism can be reconciled with a disposition to befriend liberal democracy . <p> Such a reconciliation can not be effected by simply affirming the " autonomy " of politics ; practice can not be so neatly insulated against the claims of theory . Rather , we must ask how our most careful and radical thinking should stand with respect to our deepest and most comprehensive judgments regarding how we should live and how we should order our lives together . Or , to state the problem somewhat more concretely : Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way within the purview or touching the responsibility of human beings ) for humanity in the foreseeable future must be situated somehow within the framework of liberal democracy , then how should thinking stand with respect to this political and social order ? The question , moreover , does not apply only in one direction ; it does not simply ask how we should think about liberal democracy . Rather , philosophy will not be able to take liberal democracy as its object with maximum clarity and responsibility except by first or perhaps simultaneously coming to terms with a more elusive question : How should thinking understand itself in relation to liberal democracy , taking liberal democracy in its deepest and broadest sense , that is , as representing the practical horizon of our late-modern world , the common , pre-theoretical matrix of the meanings that condition our more deliberate ends . To reduce the problem to a formula : If it is good to " think " and good to be " free , " then what is this good of thinking , and this good of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our comparison of Heidegger with Tocqueville , to begin to chart a path through such questions , we are confronted with the paradox that Heidegger 's lofty " theoretical " critique of the equivalent decadence of all forms of modernity resulted from an effort to liberate practice from theory , whereas Tocqueville 's much more nuanced and in a way " practical " view of the nature of and prospects for modern democracy proceeds alongside what appears as a thoroughly traditional or classical habit of praising the dignity of theory above the mere necessities of practice . For example , Tocqueville clearly urges the cultivation of the life of the mind , as it were for its own sake , as a counterweight to the homogenizing utilitarian undertow of American democracy . He praises " pure science , " understood as the " ardent , proud , disinterested love of truth , " as distinct from the " industrial side " of science ( 463,464,461 ) . ( n16 ) So Heidegger sets out to liberate practice and seems to end up more " theoretical , " whereas Tocqueville praises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To understand those opposing paradoxical reversals in the status of theory and practice would take us far , I think , toward more rigorously articulating the status of thought in relation to the now inevitably liberal-democratic framework of our common life . <p> To assume that the most rigorous thinking takes a certain form that we recognize as " philosophical " would seem , moreover , to presuppose the adequacy of a theoretical standpoint in some way outside of or absolved from moral and political concerns and thus a resolution of the very problem of theory and practice . Without attempting here to ascertain what Tocqueville 's rating should be against some philosophical standard of profundity , I will only cite a few texts suggesting that the author of Democracy in America from time to time betrayed a vivid , even exquisite self-awareness as a writer , an openness to the problem of his own practical-theoretical standpoint . TOCQUEVILLE 'S THEORY AND PRACTICE <p> Tocqueville raises the problem of theory and practice explicitly , if rather enigmatically , at the end of his introduction to Democracy in America . After inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mother thought " that binds all its parts together and to read the book " in the spirit in which it was written , " Tocqueville further begs the indulgence of the reader in consideration of the natural difficulty of matching words to deeds : " A man finds it almost as difficult to be inconsequent in speech as he generally finds it to be consistent in action " ( 20 ) . To make the practice of American democracy intelligible , it will be necessary almost to distort the illogical , practical reality of politics ; Tocqueville thus undertakes the task of being " inconsequent in speech . " But why would a man with theoretical gifts take such pains to be inconsequent , to accommodate the requirements of practice ? In the very final words of his introduction , Tocqueville indicates that although his book is not simply practical  --  that is , that he " did not intend to serve or to combat any existing party "  --  it is not altogether detached from partisan concerns : " I have tried to see not differently but further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have wished to consider the whole futureO ( 20 ) . Tocqueville does not set aside partisan points of view as theoretically irrelevant ; instead , one might say , he attempts to reconcile them or perhaps rather to manage and moderate their conflict  --  but in view of what more adequate end ? <p> Tocqueville from time to time explicitly associates himself with the perspective of " legislators for democracies . " As indicated above , the essence of the " alarming spectacle " presented by the emergence of modernity in Christian nations may be described precisely as a dislocation of theory and practice . To describe and respond to that spectacle is inseparable for Tocqueville from the effort to find a standpoint as a writer more humanly adequate than that of his materialist rivals , the self-styled champions of modernity . To find such a standpoint is decidedly not equivalent either to discovering a true theory already at work within American democracy or to constructing a new theory to urge on Americans and the world . Nor , Tocqueville makes clear , is it possible simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern equality and materialism . <p> Let us briefly reconsider , in this connection , Tocqueville 's account of American Cartesianism . If Descartes 's precepts are best followed in America , it is not despite their being least studied but , one might almost say , precisely because they are least studied there . In the first sentence of the second volume of Democracy in America , Tocqueville observes that " less attention is paid to philosophy in the United States than in any country of the civilized world . " If Americans have practiced the modern method of individualism with more success than other peoples  --  than the French , in particular  --  it is because in America the method has not been so " strictly applied " as in France . Whereas the French " turned the world upside down " by following the logic of the method through to its conclusion , where " all ancient things could be attacked and the way opened for everything new , " the Americans were stopped short of such radicalism by two main circumstances . First is the privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Religion in America has maintained its integrity as distinct from and thus beyond the reach of political changes ; it is not subject to political will but has " defined its own limits . " ( n17 ) Second , American society has become democratic without a democratic revolution and has thus preserved many " ancient beliefs , " much " authority , " and many " shared ideas " that would have fallen in a revolutionary confrontation with the new method of thought of democratic individualism . Americans succeed in practicing modern , democratic individualism because they have not mastered its theory  --  or ( what comes to the same thing ) because its theory has not mastered them . <p> The theory of modern democracy is viable only when it is adulterated in practice by nondemocratic residues . This would seem to imply that the theory itself is defective and ought to be replaced ; yet Tocqueville forbears proposing a theoretical alternative to replace it . To be sure , Tocqueville in the introduction to Democracy in America calls for a new political science for a new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answers his own call . His response to the new world is less a systematic or even straightforward theory than a reflection on and appreciation of an example : American democracy . <p> It would be a mistake , moreover , to assume that Tocqueville 's failure to provide a systematic alternative to defective democratic theory reflects a lack of theoretical depth or rigor . Rather , there is much evidence that Tocqueville has thought through the problem of the limits of theory or " general ideas " in relation to moral-political concerns and has chosen neither a modern-democratic " theory " nor a classical-aristocratic appeal to a particular conception of honor , but a mixed and nuanced rhetorical strategy consistent with his view of the problem. ( n18 ) For example , Tocqueville seems to introduce the township as an example of the radical theory of the sovereignty of the people , according to which the people are " the cause and the end of all things " ( 60 ) , but he actually shows the careful reader how different the reality of communal self-government , which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 62 ) , is from the modern theory of democracy . Similarly , Tocqueville encourages or allows the Americans ' belief in the democratic philosophy of " self-interest properly understood "  --  although the honor they pay to this philosophy tends to dishonor them ( 2. ii.8 ) " and then shows how in practice Americans often honor themselves more than their philosophy ( see , especially , 2. ii.14 ) . <p> If the " knowledge of how to combine " is the " mother " of knowledge and the fountain of progress ( 517 ) , it is therefore by no means identical to the " philosophy " to which the Americans themselves like to give credit . And Tocqueville 's proclaimed " new political science " ( 17 ) clearly can not be simply identified with the theory of enlightened self-interest . For Tocqueville , a truly " stable point in the human heartO ( 239 ) must be located in the vicinity of " man 's true greatness " ( 452 ) , a terrain completely ignored by the materialistic science of modern individualism . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no alternative theory of man and society ? <p> To argue that Tocqueville bows prudently to the irresistible political force of modern democracy would be true but incomplete . To conclude that Tocqueville simply sacrifices theoretical to practical concerns would be implicitly to assume that a theory of practice separate from practice is possible , whereas Tocqueville appears convinced that it is not . If democratic ideas , in seeking to embrace the universality of human nature , ignore the true and unequal greatness of human beings , then aristocratic ideas distort that greatness through the imposition of narrow and artificial categories . One might conceive of the possibility of a divine standpoint from which to combine the universality of the democratic with the elevation of the aristocrat , but one can not spell out what it would mean fully to adopt this standpoint ( 2. i.3 ) . Indeed , one might say that the attempt radically to separate the idea of elevation or greatness  --  of the good or of God  --  from ordinary , practical , human concerns tends toward the same disastrous effect whether its original motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity from divine interference . Tocqueville 's profound insight is that the extremes of humility and of mastery meet ; that is why the modern dislocation between theory and practice ( for the purpose of practical mastery ) inspires in Tocqueville a specifically religious terror. ( n19 ) <p> A theory of practice would be a theory of greatness or of the good of practice , and this appears impossible . If it does not follow that practice is groundless or that theory is impotent , the reason is that the two are not finally separate but appear to spring from some elusive common ground . If the dignity of practice in a sense depends on its openness to the life of the mind ( 2. i.9-10 ) , then the dignity of theory depends no less on an openness to practical greatness . <p> The interdependence of theory and practice helps to explain Tocqueville 's complex disposition toward his democratic subject : He offers a powerful and straightforward indictment of his theoretical rivals , the modern , materialistic champions , but typically approaches his practical subjects with a certain gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sometimes evinces considerable respect for the inarticulate virtues of the Americans . Precisely because he understands the insuperable and hazardous antinomies of attempts to grasp the good or the great theoretically , Tocqueville finds a way to evoke a sense of greatness without dismissing the decency of the moderate materialism of the Americans . <p> Tocqueville 's measured praise of Americans as the most practically successful of theoretical peoples must be understood in the light of his insight into the way in which thought graces practice without quite transcending it . The author of Democracy in America never presumes to leave behind the practical realm because he knows that the dignity of theory can not be defended in absolute abstraction from the dignity of concrete practices . PRACTICAL TOCQUEVILLE , THEORETICAL HEIDEGGER ? <p> What , then , is at stake in Heidegger 's adoption of a much more radical standpoint with respect to modern democracy ? ( n20 ) Here I can only suggest a framework for addressing the question by noting further possible implications of the contrast between Tocqueville and Heidegger . <p> One might begin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and containment of the nihilistic logic of modern reason , Heidegger in fact calls for the fulfillment or final radicalization of the spirit of " technology " as the only possible path to its being overcome : " It is precisely in this extreme danger that the innermost indestructible belongingness of man within granting may come to light . " ( n21 ) Whereas Tocqueville sees no alternative to human dependence on " dogmatic beliefs " and thus attempts to discern and reinforce a relatively wholesome and manageable mixture of beliefs , traditional , Christian , and modern , Heidegger apparently hopes that on the far side of the complete absorption of the idea of nature by the processes of technology , human beings might find access to their own home in the temporalizing essence of Being itself . Tocqueville conceives no possibility of a direct access to Being , unmediated by moral-political and therefore partly instrumental concerns , and so aims to balance residues of broadly " Platonic " and hierarchical conceptions of the good against the dominant progressive , equalizing , materialist impulses of transcendence . He knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape implication in human instrumentalities , but he would see no point in attempting to talk about " Being " as altogether other than all ( " higher " and " lower " ) beings . Heidegger , on the other hand , wants to overcome both tainted reifications of transcendence ( the modern subjectivist representation and consequent forgetting having issued from the classical " idea " ) toward some pure hearkening to Being . <p> Tocqueville discloses his more moderate view of modern democracy only as a response to a rigorous reflection on the nihilistic potential of modernity , as well as on the limitations of traditional notions of transcendence , and , indeed , on the implication of such notions , via radical monotheism , in the destructive dualism of modernity itself . In that sense , he might be said to agree with Heidegger 's famous gloss on Holderin 's word : " But where the danger is , grows the saving power also . " ( n22 ) But rather than aspiring to a transformation of the public world ( either through resolute action or by waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abyssal understanding of Being , Tocqueville seeks to highlight and thus preserve intimations of transcendence still glimmering within the practical world of democracy . Is this more " practical " disposition the result of a lack of rigor or boldness or , on the contrary , of a more subtle understanding of the human predicament vis-a-vis transcendence , an awareness of the inevitable compromising of transcendence by the instrumental practices within which or on the borders of which it inevitably appears ? <p> If pure transcendence is ultimately unspeakable , as Heidegger and Tocqueville seem to agree , then should n't this imply the end of the assumed absolute privilege of theory over practice , and thus of the intellectual  --  including the Heideggerian philosopher-thinker-poet  --  over the citizen or believer or , for that matter , the bourgeois individual ? Does not Heidegger succumb ( albeit in a new , indeed more radical manner ) to the distinctively modern wish that some unmediated truth ( even the truth of historical mediation or " temporality " ) might become the " effectual truth " of a people and , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apparently passive and apolitical discourse of " letting-be " would remain ministerial to an ambition of mastery . And Tocqueville 's more obviously political or " legislative " discourse might then be seen , paradoxically , as a truer form of letting-be , since it takes its bearings from the hopes and hierarchies ( always more or less **26;655;TOOLONG ) implicit in actual human practices . If Tocqueville can live with the understanding that our notions of transcendence are always more or less tainted by the all-too-human , it may be because he sees that the reverse must also be true  --  that all political and instrumental language secretes some understanding ( however dim ) of transcendence . <p> Might not Heidegger 's radical critique of modernity betray a wish to re-occupy the fallen modern intellectual 's role as champion and legislator of humanity ? Heidegger rejects the idea of a theory governing practice from some supposed external Archimedean leverage point . But does he not continue , in effect , to hope for some kind of salvation springing from or at least privileging the poet-philosopher 's insight  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of non- or anti-theory , some poetry , some meditative thinking ( or , earlier , some volkish resolution ) of which he , Heidegger , is the prophet and which is to fill the void left by the collapse of metaphysics ? ( n23 ) <p> What is at stake here is the relation of both philosophy and politics to the problem of transcendence . If openness to " truth " as transcendence ( however understood ) is essential to humanity , and if Heidegger and the postmoderns are correct that no abstract , theoretical , final , or absolute articulation of transcendence is possible , then the question of the character of political philosophy after or within the eclipse of modern rationalism takes this form : Can attention to the transcendent be integrated or at least coordinated with sober judgments regarding politics , and in particular with a sober respect for liberal democracy ? Or must the claims of transcendence find expression in contempt for liberal democracy and the prophecy of radical modes of transcendence ( if not a new " dispensation of Being , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " democracy to come " ) untainted by the vulgarity of common , bourgeois-liberal concerns ? <p> How are we to choose , then , with the most thoughtful rigor between the two orientations toward the transcendent or other-than-human , and corresponding attitudes regarding modern democracy as it actually exists ? Consider addressing the question in the light of the following alternatives : Is liberal democracy flawed and fragile but decent and defensible , not only as a form of government but as a matrix of ways of life that , however limited , are recognizably human ?
