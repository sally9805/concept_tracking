The summer I was fourteen , I went to stay in a small house in Connecticut with my grandmother and grandfather . My mother sent me there , she told me years later , because I was driving her crazy , coming home late , shirking my chores , smoking my father 's cigarettes . She wanted me out of the house , she said , out of her life , at least for a while . What she told me at the time , and what I see now as the better reason after all , was that she wanted me to know my father 's parents before it was too late . She especially wanted me to know my grandfather : to know him as something other than a three-legged man . I had seen him only once before , when we traveled to Connecticut for the funeral of <p> family member who must have been important , because ordinarily my father did not speak about his parents , much less take us to visit them . <p> A curious thing happened during that first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed door , looking up at the doorknob . My grandfather was in the dining room sweeping the floor because I had spilled a bowl of cracked nutshells . As I lifted my hand to open the door , I felt a stinging at my knees , and I fell backward to the floor . I looked up and saw my grandfather with the sweeping end of the broom in his hand . The handle of the broom rested between my legs , where he had jerked it to twist me away from the door . The rest was a blur of tears . <p> The incident meant little to me at the time ; his legs left the more lasting impression . " My name is Peter , and I 'm in the first grade , and my grandfather has three legs , " was how I introduced myself to a house guest , a colleague of my father 's , a few days after we came home . My father called my mother aside and told her to speak to me . She pulled me into the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people have two ; excepting that , he 's no different from anyone else . He is , in fact , quite unremarkable . Your father would rather that you did n't speak of him . " I never said another word about him , nor , of course , did my father , nor my mother . <p> Not until the year I turned twelve , when , on the way home from my father 's funeral , driving through the November rain , my mother began to talk about my grandfather , who had not attended the funeral because my grandmother was too ill with pneumonia to travel . " They think he was supposed to have been twins , " my mother said . " But something happened in the womb . " My mother told me about the woman who delivered him , how she went hysterical and dropped him on the floor and ran screaming out of the house and never practiced midwifery again . This was in a small hill town somewhere in Sicily . My mother said that people came from miles around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them stuck his third leg with a pin , to watch it bleed , to satisfy themselves that it was real . The leg could not be removed , she said , because an operation would result in paralysis or death . The business with the pins upset me deeply , but I asked her to tell me more . " I 've told you as much as your father told me , " she said . <p> She put me on a train that took six hours to get to Connecticut . I bought a girlie magazine in Union Station to help pass the time on the trip , and a tabloid newspaper to wrap around the magazine in case I should sit next to an old lady . I sat next to a businessman , and still I was embarrassed ; but when I had finished the newspaper , and the backsides of Philadelphia row houses and everybody 's trash and laundry no longer held my attention , I began to sneak peaks at the naked women . The flashes of tanned skin and pink nipples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train window , were somehow more enticing than a long look would have been . I stepped off the train dizzy from hours on the verge , feeling as if I had spent the day sitting in a fine mist that never quite became a rain . <p> My grandfather met me at the station , dressed in a starched white shirt , a pink tie , and a pair of dark gray trousers with three pant legs . I had forgotten how his third leg was attached , so I lingered behind him as we walked to his car , pretending I was having trouble lifting my suitcase . The third leg , which was shorter than the other two by some eighteen inches , attached at the back and protruded toward his right . The leg hung in midair and swung gently from side to side as he walked , reminding me of a sailboat 's rudder . On his third foot was a polished black shoe that matched the two on his walking feet , but was smaller . <p> We said little in the car during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , which , in essence , I was . My grandfather drove with his third leg resting between us on the front seat of the Buick , the sole of his shoe almost touching my leg . I looked straight ahead and gripped my thigh with my left hand to avoid touching his third foot . <p> My grandmother greeted us in the kitchen . She sat beside the screen door , turning red peppers on an electric coil burner . She seemed shorter and thinner than I had remembered , the skin on her face cracked and wrinkled like the roasting peppers . She kissed my grandfather as though he had been away for weeks and then stood slowly and kissed me on each cheek ; I had to bend over because I was taller than she was now . The house , too , was smaller than I remembered , and all on one floor . Through the kitchen window , I could see a sprawling backyard garden , and beyond a steep brushy hillside that disappeared into woods , and then a wide valley , with smokestacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a thin line of silver . There did n't seem much to do for a week ; I was glad I had the magazine . <p> " Take your bag back to your room , " my grandfather said . " The door at the end of the hall . " The two of them stood with their arms around each other as I left the kitchen , studying me , perhaps remembering the many times my father had passed through the same doorway . I walked by the bathroom , and then by the open door to their bedroom . Opposite their door was a closed door I recognized at once as the one I had tried to open as a young child . I decided to take a peek inside , to see why my grandfather had knocked me over with the broom . I thought that perhaps the door opened into my father 's old room . But as I reached for the knob , I felt eyes watching me , and , looking back , I saw my grandfather , a three-legged silhouette in the arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I turned back around and went to my room . <p> The first thing I did was slip the magazine between the mattress and the box spring of the Harvard bed , all the way to the middle , in case my grandmother tried to remake the bed . The room was just big enough for the bed and a dresser , on top of which was <p> mason jar of fresh-cut flowers . In the center of one wall was an opened window that made the small herb garden outside seem part of the room . The herb garden was terraced above the main vegetable garden , contained by a stone wall , and when the wind stirred , even a little , the room filled with the aroma of sweet basil and lemon balm . After unpacking my clothes , I stashed my matches and cigarettes  --  the last of my father 's cartons  --  in with the magazine . <p> I was surprised to find my grandfather still standing at the entrance to the hallway when I came out of the bedroom . He laid a bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you once before to stay out of that room , " he said . <p> " Yes , sir , " I said , although I could n't remember anything he had told me , only the sting of the broom . I felt tall beside my grandfather , out of place ; I had no idea what I should do or say next . The smell of the peppers drifted in from the kitchen . <p> " Come , " he said . " You and I , we 'll garden while your grandmother finishes supper . " He nudged me into the kitchen . As I stepped out the door , I smiled at my grandmother , though I could n't say why , and she smiled back through her horn-rimmed glasses , her eyes the size and color of worn pennies . <p> My grandfather handed me a metal tool that looked like a miniature stirrup , but with razor-sharp edges . Ahead of me , he bent over a leafy row , so that his third leg stuck stiffly in the air and seemed to remain suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped downward . " This is a carrot top , " he said , gathering a handful of thin-leafed stalks . " The rest is weeds . " He slipped the shoes off all three of his feet , removed his knee-high black socks , and then rolled up his three pant legs . I kneeled down on the damp black soil and began chopping at weeds with the tool . Now and again , I pulled up a carrot , to hear its roots tear loose from the earth , to feel it break free . Then I would clean the dirt off it as best I could and eat it . I yanked out a carrot that forked in two . This one I threw into the woods behind me ; its two knobby shanks and hairy roots seemed too strange to eat . I looked up to make sure my grandfather had n't seen me waste what was , after all , a perfectly good carrot . He sat several rows away , tying a tomato vine to a bamboo stake , leaning back on his third leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He caught me staring at his legs , and I expected him to chastise me , but instead , he asked me to tell him about Washington . He wanted to know if his money had been well spent . So I told him about monuments and museums and wide streets . And then he told me about Waterbury , about the floods , especially about the big one in ' 38 , when he was trapped in the basement of his cousin 's warehouse , down along the railroad tracks by the river , and we talked some about baseball , which we both loved , and about steam trains and sports cars and wars . Only once , when talking about the big flood , did he mention his legs , and that was to say that , when swimming , he used his third leg to steer . We both smiled at this , he studied my face curiously for a moment , and then he changed the subject back to trains . <p> After supper I helped wash the dishes  --  something my mother had insisted I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the opera , so I had braced myself by the time we sat down in the living room to listen to the radio . My grandfather positioned himself on the crushed velvet couch with his third leg propped on his right thigh , so that he was both sitting cross-legged and sitting with two feet on the floor . My grandmother sat to his left . As we listened to La Traviata , they patted each other 's hands and looked into each other 's eyes like this was a first date , mouthing the words in Italian and gently tilting back their heads , as though they were sniffing the bouquet of flowers on the coffee table . I listened in a dreamy sort of way , and when Violetta sang , I closed my eyes and imagined I was rolling her nipples between my fingers and running my tongue up her thighs . When the opera was over , my grandmother struggled to her feet , kissed us both good night , and left the room . <p> " Now would be a good time for a snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television to the Mets game , then retired to the kitchen . When he returned , he handed me a bowl of ice cream . " This is for helping in the garden , " he said . He sat down again on the sofa . On the coffee table in front of him , he arranged a tall glass of ice water and two enormous bowls , one full of mixed nuts , the other empty , awaiting shells . We watched the first inning in silence , my grandfather working almost feverishly at cracking and eating the nuts . <p> When he saw that I was watching , he picked up two walnuts , held them together in his left hand , and squeezed until one of them cracked cleanly in two . " I eat fourteen percent more than the average man of my size and build , " he said as he ate the walnut , " on account of my extra leg . " <p> I smiled . " Fourteen percent , " I said , " and not fifteen or sixteen ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . " He winked at me , the amber light from the Tiffany lamp glinting in his eye . <p> He handed me two walnuts . " Give it a try , " he said . I squeezed the nuts together until my fingers ached . Nothing . Not a crack . My grandfather laughed and scooped up two walnuts in each hand . " Put your hands on mine , " he said . I leaned forward and placed my hands over his , my palms against his knuckles . His hands tightened at the same time , cracking all four walnut shells . <p> I let out a breath as if I had done the work . " You must be fourteen percent stronger than the average man , " I said . <p> " Strength has nothing to do with it . " He began picking the meat out of the shells . " Practice , " he said . " Practice and desire . " <p> In the bottom of the eighth , I noticed that he had fallen asleep with his mouth open . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandmother were now asleep . I saw my chance to slip into the room  --  I could always call back to him as if from the bathroom . <p> When I reached the door , I glanced across the hall , expecting to see the closed door to their bedroom . But their door was open , <p> night light of some sort was on , and my grandmother was sitting upright against the headboard , staring straight at me . I stood still a moment and tried to decide , without fully looking at her , whether she was awake or asleep with her eyes open , or if something had happened . I decided to wait until the middle of the night to try the door , and as soon as I was certain that my grandmother was alive , I walked back to my bedroom . <p> A warm night breeze blew in from the opened window , bringing with it the now familiar mix of basil and lemon balm . I retrieved my cigarettes , climbed out the window , and sat on the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manicured in the shape of an owl . As I smoked , adding my own piquant aroma to the air , I watched the lights in the valley , flickering like earth stars , like the fireflies dancing in the woods . I could n't keep my mind on any one thing : not on the room , not on baseball , not on the fireflies , not on girls , although eventually , when I reached the end of my third cigarette , I could not get girls out of my mind , the way their breasts attached to their bodies , a place I had never touched before , nor seen even , except in pictures . <p> I climbed back inside and took out the magazine and studied Miss July by flashlight and thought about how her skin would feel where her breasts curved back into her body toward her underarms , and how her nipples would feel , and the hair between her legs , the lips between her legs . <p> When I had finished my business , I lay on top of the sheets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there a long while before I fell asleep , savoring the heaviness in my head and the limpness in my legs , and wondering , now that I could think again about something other than women , what was inside the room . <p> My plans to sneak into the room during the night were foiled by my grandfather , who turned out to be a fitful sleeper . I would hear him fussing with the radio in his room , or flushing the toilet , or watching television in the living room , where I found him once , peeling an apple , the peel corkscrewing onto the floor , no wider than a stick of linguine and perhaps ten feet long . One night , while heading for the room on the off-chance that he was asleep , I stumbled into him in the darkened hallway . I had my hand out in front of me to help me find the way , and when we collided , my hand pressed against the hair on his bare chest , which made me shudder and him stiffen . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smelled of anchovies . I hurried to the bathroom , where I sat in the dark for a while , wondering whether he had been wearing a bathrobe or had been naked . I resolved to find a way into the room during broad daylight . But over the next four days , the chance never came . <p> We were picking greens for our dinner salad when my grandfather turned to me and said , " I 'm sorry about the broom . " He rubbed the knee of his third leg as he spoke . <p> " It 's all right , " I said . " Pass me the basket , I 've got more arugula than I can hold . " <p> " I said some things about you to your mother that I regret , " he said . " You 're a good boy . A smart boy . " I wanted to feel pleased with what he said , but all I could think about was the magazine and the cigarettes and my plan to sneak into the room . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up garlic bulbs my grandfather had planted the previous fall . We worked side by side while my grandmother scurried about her flower garden , singing Italian songs and keeping time with her pruning shears . She sang loud enough for us to hear her as we harvested the garlic , but when the air heated up and the sun began to bake our skin , she grew silent and then returned to the house . <p> My grandfather , who , as always , was dressed in a white shirt , <p> tie , and trousers , wiped his brow with a handkerchief . " When I was some years younger than you are now , " he said to me , " I went to visit a state institution for children . A friend of my father 's took me there . " He cleared his throat and put the handkerchief back in his shirt pocket . I sat back on the straw mulch , and he looked down at me , squinting in the sun , his dark face and gray hair in shadow against the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued , " children lying in beds , sitting in the sun , wandering along a stone terrace , writhing on the floor so that we had to step over them . Children with no eyes , children who could n't hear or wall&lt; or talk . Children who screamed as if they had demons in their head . Children with misshapen bodies , stunted hands , no arms , no legs . Children covered with scabs , one little boy without a jaw . " He was making me sick . The slug creeping through the straw on the path between us was making me sick . My grandfather raised his hoe and brought it down on the slug , slicing it in two . " I am a lucky man , " he said . I did n't know how to respond . I beat a bulb of garlic on the ground to knock off the clods of dirt . <p> We carried baskets of garlic over to a wooden shed my grandfather had built along one end of the garden , next to his fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops , bulbs of garlic had been laid out to dry . My grandfather gathered some of the dried garlic and showed me how to make a garlic braid by twisting the tops together , using a piece of wire to give it strength . We braided garlic for several hours . While we worked , he told me stories about his days in the brass business . His cousin owned a company that distributed brass fittings ; my grandfather had worked in the office , as a bookkeeper . He seemed prepared to braid garlic clear until supper . Thinking that I would have a chance at the room if my grandmother was busy in the kitchen , I told my grandfather that I needed to use the bathroom . <p> " You go on inside , " he said . " And then you do whatever you like . Read a comic book or go down to the corner store . " He took his wallet from his front pants pocket  --  he had no back pocket because his third leg was in the way  --  and pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handing me the bill , " buy yourself an ice cream . " I thanked him and ran inside , where I found my grandmother in the living room , sitting on the velvet sofa . <p> Her head was tilted back , and her eyes were closed . I looked real hard at her , until I was certain I had seen her chest rise . She wore tennis shoes , and appeared twenty years younger in the bright sunlight , and had her legs spread apart in a way I was sure she would have considered unladylike . I thought to myself , looking at her legs where they disappeared under her apron and blue-checked housedress : This is the woman who made love to a three-legged man . And then , feeling ashamed of myself , and sorry for her because she looked so tired , and because it struck me that she and my grandfather did n't have too much longer together , I thought : This is the woman whose only son , my father , suffered and died before her . I walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to disturb her bun , and then I went straight for the door to the room and opened it . <p> The first thing I saw , on the wall to my left , was a huge circus poster , ten feet long and as tall as the room , with swirling gold-leaf ornamentation and the words , " WALTER L. MAINS CIRCUS  --  Home of the World 's Only Three-Legged Man , " and then , set off in quotations , " King of the Freaks . " The date on the poster was 1903 ; my grandfather could not have been more than thirteen at the time . <p> The room was filled with circus memorabilia , most of it having to do with my grandfather . On the wall to my right hung framed circus programs and sepia photographs . A picture of my grandfather as a young boy , wearing a checkered jacket , shorts , and striped knee socks on all three legs , standing with a man who must have been his father , my great-grandfather . Pictures of my grandfather sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his left foot on a stool , his third foot on a stool . My grandfather wearing satin shirts and circus tights and polished pointy-toed boots . My grandfather in photographs with silver script : " Only Three-Legged Man in the World &; The Bearded Lady , " " Only Three-Legged Man in the World &; The Sheep-Headed Man , " " Only Three-Legged Man in the World &; The Tiny Midgets . " In this one , he is in a Three-Legged kneel , with the Tiny Woman sitting on his right leg and the Tiny Man sitting on his left , their tiny legs dangling in the air , ropes to a circus tent crisscrossing behind them . My grandfather is smiling , but the Tiny Man has a stern , joyless expression , a tiny cigar in his mouth . On the far wall , to either side of a window , were posters from Ringling Bros . Circus , from Barnum &; Bailey Circus , even from Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , all with paintings of my grandfather . Behind me were autographed pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to the window , careful to stay to one side , and peered out to check on my grandfather . He was coming toward the door to the root cellar beneath me , his arms by his sides , each hand holding a cabbage , upside down by the stem . He was whistling a tune like nothing in this room had ever happened . As I backed away from the window , I bumped a table , knocking over a stack of cards . I knew I still had some time while he fussed about in the root cellar , culling bad fruit from last fall or wrapping the cabbages in newspaper . I knelt down and picked up the cards . Each one had a picture of my grandfather in an old-fashioned striped swimsuit , the kind with a tank top and skin-tight , knee-length legs . The cards had his signature on them and a message : <p> THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD WITH 3 LEGS , 4 FEET , 16 TOES , <p> 2 BODIES FROM THE WAIST DOWN . OPERATION IMPOSSIBLE . <p> 3RD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PLEASE SHOW THIS PHOTO TO YOUR FRIEND . <p> I put two cards in my pocket and the others back on the table , next to a book called The Giant Book of Freaks . The book was laid out like a high school yearbook , page after page of photographs and descriptions of people with every imaginable and unimaginable deformity , and wherever it seemed useful , the people were photographed nude . I knew I had to hurry , but I stopped to study a woman with breasts the size of watermelons , bigger than watermelons , they drooped down past her waist , and a woman twisted up like a pretzel , also nude , but with no breasts at all , and another with pubic hair that hung to the floor . It occurred to me that my grandfather must be in the book , perhaps naked . But before I could find him in the index  --  and even as I looked I was n't sure <p> wanted to see his picture  --  I heard the screen door to the kitchen swing open . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . <p> I lay on the bed in the heat of the afternoon , dizzy , my cheeks flushed , the way I felt once after looking at one of my father 's anatomy books . I had to shake my head to forget the woman with pubic hair that curled down around her toes . My grandfather : King of the Freaks . Perhaps the woman with watermelon tits was the queen . I sat up , afraid I would faint , and stared out the window , past the herbs , past the tops of tomato stakes and bean poles and pea trellises , off into the blank sky . <p> I got out the magazine and , tired already of the centerfold , found another woman to look at , a blonde stretched out on a pink chaise longue beside a turquoise swimming pool . The room was hot , sunlight pouring in through the big window . I took forever to get hard , but I kept working at it , mostly to keep my hands busy , my mind occupied . When I was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head out the window , sending smoke into the sky in measured puffs , like smoke signals . <p> At supper my grandfather and grandmother were more quiet than usual . I wondered if they were sad because this was my last night with them , or if they were tired from their day of gardening and housework , from their long lives , or if somehow one or both of them knew I had been in the room . The kitchen was hot from my grandmother 's cooking and from the heat outside , which did n't seem to be going away with the sun as it had on previous nights . My grandmother had fixed fresh grilled tuna steak with roasted red peppers and a thin , brothy tomato sauce . It was as <p> bit into a pepper that I realized I had left open The Giant Book of Freaks . A sinking feeling came over me . I would have to sneak back into the room at night somehow and close the book . I began to sweat , imagining my grandfather finding the open book after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor boy , " my grandmother said . " Too hot in the kitchen or did you bite into one of your grandfather 's peppers ? " <p> " Both , " I said . " Water . More water , please . " My grandfather passed me the water pitcher . I filled my glass , drank it , and filled it again . As I drank the second glass , it came to me that I should drink and drink and complain bitterly about the heat . Then they would believe that I had to keep going to the bathroom at night . And on one of my trips , surely my grandfather would be asleep and I could slip into the room and close the book . <p> On my first trip to the bathroom that night , I found my grandfather coming down the hall on his way back from the kitchen , a glass of ice water clinking in his unsteady hand . <p> " Careful , " he said , " watch your step . " I could see that he had on his bathrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hallway . <p> On my second trip , I saw a blue flickering light from the television and heard him fanning himself with the newspaper . I left the door ajar and stood on the side of the bathtub , so that the sound of my pee hitting the toilet water would echo down the hall . I wanted to be sure he understood why I was up . <p> At four o'clock , I scanned the hall and then walked slowly toward the room . Their door was shut , and no lights were on in the rest of the house . Here was my chance . I opened the door . <p> My grandfather stood at the far end of the room , to the right of the open window , stark naked in the full light of the moon , his back to me . He was flipping through the pages of the book . His bathrobe lay draped over a chair . <p> " Take a good look , " he said , " so you 'll never forget . " He stayed with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " My hand was still on the doorknob . I should have turned and run , but instead I stayed to have a look . His shoulders drooped naturally enough , his torso curving down toward his waist , but his buttocks were formed by his left leg and his third leg ; I could not see how his right leg was attached . I noticed that his two front legs were sized and shaped somewhat differently ; he had three legs but not a pair . I thought I was going to vomit or cry or maybe even collapse from the heat and the strangeness of it , his wrinkled , splotchy skin and sagging buttocks , the limpness of his third leg , pale and shriveled in the moonlight , and the tiny club-shaped fourth foot springing from the thigh of the third leg , its toes curled , the whole of it no bigger than a dog 's paw . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said , looking away . <p> " Never mind that now , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought he might put on his bathrobe and tell me about his circus days . I wished he would at least put on the robe . <p> As soon as I closed the door behind me , my grandfather turned around . I caught his eye and then looked down . That 's when I saw the area between his legs . My grandfather had , protruding from his tangled , still-black pubic hair , two scrotums and two penises . I took a quick look at them , hating myself for doing so , and then I looked down at my bare feet . <p> " I was going to show you this room tomorrow , " my grandfather said , " before you left . I am proud of this room  --  I only show it to my closest friends . " He slammed his hand on the table , and I jerked my head and looked him straight in the eyes . " I am a lucky man , " he said . " Your father never understood me when I said this . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to help in the garden like you . " <p> He talked for ten minutes , naked the whole time  --  he would not reach for his robe  --  and I stood with my hand on the doorknob and listened as best I could and prayed he would finish soon . I stared into his eyes until it was clear to me that he stood there because he wanted me to see him , and then I lowered my gaze to between his legs and took a good long look . <p>
