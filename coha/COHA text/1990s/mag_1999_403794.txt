GARY pushed through the crowd milling around base camp waiting for dawn to warm the cold horizon . He paused on the step of the camp trailer . He hated to go in . He hated everything about this . The warmth inside was overwhelming . Search and rescue people , coats undone , were testing radios or hovering over a pin-studded map taped to the table . Gary recognized some friends of his father , men from neighboring ranches who had come to help . Sheriff Dowd was there , so was Mike Novitch from the Lazy Y. So was Ted Nichols . " I 've been telling Owen Miller for years that old Super Cub would be the death of him , " Nichols said , straightening his expensive snow bibs . Novitch nudged him in the ribs and whispered , ' +That 's his boy at the door . " Novitch attempted a weak smile . " How are you holding up , kid ? Need to ask you a couple of questions . " GARY shuffled through the trailer , feeling out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast . Clear and cold . Very cold . He stopped near the map table . " Is there any word yet ? " Sheriff Dowd shook his head . " No , it 's still too dark to search . Look , uh .... " " Right . Does your dad keep any " Right . Does your dad keep any survival gear in his plane ? " Gary nodded . " A sleeping bag , a .22 carbine . Candy bars and stuff . " " Good . " Dowd stuck another pin in the map . " Radar picked him up here , just before sunset . Right before he sent the mayday . Know where he was going ? " " He was bringing the plane back from Copper City . " Gary felt fear crawling up his gut . " He told Mom he 'd be back early , so he probably flew over Goat Pass and down Tolman Creek . " TED Nichols coughed . " Goat Pass is a long ways from where radar painted him , especially if he was having engine trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My guess is he kept to the east side of the Clear Fork . " " Hmm . " Dowd scratched his chin . " Mike ? You know the Clear Fork . Why do n't you ride with the National Guard chopper ? Keep the air search over there for now . Hopefully you 'll pick up his emergency signal . Ted ? " " You want me to search Tolman Creek with snowmobiles ? " Nichols answered the question before it was asked . " O.K. Should be light enough to start . " Gary looked around the cramped command center . Worry made his throat dry , his chest tight . " Where should I go ? " It was an effort to speak . " I brought our sled along . " // Gary 's dad 's plane has crashed in the wilderness . Where is anybody 's guess . Gary has a hunch , and his father 's life may hang in the balance-but will anyone listen to a kid ? // Dowd cleared his throat . Nichols was more blunt . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate until you 're 16 . " Gary knew about Search and Rescue rules , but this was n't just any victim-it was his dad . " I 'll be 16 next spring , " he pleaded . Dowd buttoned his sheepskin coat . " It 'd be best if you stayed here . Just in case word comes in . " The walls closed around him like an avalanche . He felt too old to cry , but angry tears glazed his eyes . " That 's my dad out there . " No one said anything . Gary felt like a ghost as Nichols brushed past , leaving him behind to wait . He zipped his coat and stepped outside . Daylight was breaking cold and clear as promised . THERE IS A TIME to listen , and there is a time to act , Gary thought , as he stole a glance around , wondering if anyone was bothering to watch him . He strained , pulling the snowmobile off the ranch 's rust-streaked truck . Once it had been the hottest machine on the snow . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cracked , jagged green patches scarring the fiberglass . Like everything else on the ranch , it had seen better days . Just like Dad 's airplane . Just like Dad . " Stop it , " he scolded himself . " Dad 's all right . I know he is . " He sloshed gas from a five-gallon can into the sled 's tank , trying hard to keep his thick mittens dry . Gary primed the engine , then pulled the rip cord . The machine coughed , buzzing to life like a hornet on the prowl . Snow scattered as he moved out , catching Nichols and his team a mile and a half up the trail , making a radio check . " What are you doing ? " Nichols stuffed the radio in a pocket . " I 'm going with you . " " No , you 're not . " Gary stared at the older man . " Then I 'll go on my own . " Nichols shook his head . The kid 's as stubborn as his old man , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Gary , he said , " Tag along , then . But stay close . I do n't need two of you lost . " IT WAS BITTERLY COLD in the timbered shadows , the sun too low to spill over the treetops to the snowbound earth . Fine snow drifted under Gary 's scuffed helmet , biting his neck . The higher they climbed , the worse the trails became , old tracks slipping on and off the main trail like a child 's scribbling . He struggled to keep pace with the faster machines , now little more than distant clouds . Try as he might , he fell behind , losing sight of the leaders . The creek branched , overflowing , thick hard ice leaving no trace of tracks . Gary drifted to a stop . The powdery snow , chewed to clouds by hungry snowmobiles , sifted over fresh tracks and old alike , confusing which fork the team of sleds had taken . " That 's got to be Tolman Creek , " Gary muttered , cold despite his exertions . One direction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping he was still following the SAR sleds . The trail was soft . He skirted tree trunks , fighting for headway . Doubt crept in , the winter landscape playing tricks on his worried mind . Maybe this was n't the right trail . A short.pitch , steep as a castle wall ; lay ahead , bright sunlight beckoning on top . Gathering what speed he could , he charged the hill . The old machine whined , slowly losing momentum . Almost to the top Gary piled off , pushing for all he was worth . Lurching , the sled broke over the top , pulling its rider along . A treeless swath of snow curved gracefully in front of him . HE GUNNED the engine , running full throttle down the long meadow . There was no sign of the other riders . Time was against him . So was the sun . His eyes , so long in shadow , squinted painfully in the brittle light . He never saw the snow-covered boulder sitting in his path . He flew over the hood , the windshield sheared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headfirst , engulfed . Snow down his neck , snow in his helmet , he crawled to his feet , ribs smarting from the sharp landing . Mad at himself , he stared at his toppled machine . The snowmobile 's skis stuck apart at an impossible angle , the tie-rod shattered by the impact . Gary stood waist deep in the snow , feet cold , fear building . Base camp lay less than five miles away , but on foot in snow like this it might as well have been a hundred . He took a slogging step down his own track , hoping to meet the search party somewhere below . The snow , so soft and gentle , was as unforgiving as quicksand . That 's when he heard the gunshot . ACROSS the meadow , hidden in the glare , sat ... something . Gary squinted , straining to make out the vague , yellow shape near the timberline . Two more shots split the frigid air . " Dad ! " he yelled , hope rising at the three-shot distress signal . He turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exhaustion owned Gary by the time he reached the crash site . The tail of the little plane poked up through a drift like a forgotten flag . There was no sign of life . Worry colder than the ice in his boots gnawed at him . " Dad ! " he called , wading forward . " Can you hear me ? " " Down here . " He looked in dismay at the tangled ball of metal tubing and fabric that only yesterday had been a sturdy airplane . Nestled beneath the wreckage lay a dark , shivering lump , the .22 carbine propped against its feet The smell of gas seeping from the overturned wing tanks clung dangerously to the air . " You 're a sight for sore eyes , " said Gary 's dad , his head poking up from a sleeping bag . His lips quaked . Frozen blood spotted his frost-pale forehead . " You 're alive ! " Gary yelled , sliding under the twisted wing . " So they tell me . " His dad grimaced . " Easy there ! Tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken , skin bone pale . Gary stared down at the long , white-soaked meadow . A crescent moon flirted with the skyline . Soon , night would fall . " Dad , I wrecked the sled . And I do n't think I can drag you out of here on foot . " // " Dad ! " Gary yelled as he slogged through the snow toward the crash site . // Gary rushed to set the fuel-soaked wing ablaze . // Owen Miller managed a humorless laugh . " Ai n't we a pair to draw to . " GARY FOUGHT to build a fire , fingers burning cold . They had moved 30 feet from the wreckage to the lee of a snowdrift , where his dad lay motionless inside the sleeping bag . The twigs sputtered , acrid smoke stinging his eyes as he blew them to flame . Gary 's tired legs ached as he trudged off for more wood . Wind set the trees to crying , a lonesome sound . Then Gary heard a far-off rumble . " Snowmobiles ! " Gary snapped more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this burning . Maybe they 'll see us ! " Already the echo seemed fainter . He rushed to the plane and grabbed the rifle , firing three fast rounds . " Too far , " Owen mumbled . He was right . If they were going to be noticed they would need a much larger fire to melt the gathering twilight . Gary felt panic rise in his throat . It was n't fair . He slammed his mittened fist against the shattered fuselage . " That 's it ! " Gary shouted . He rushed to his father , shaking him gently . " Dad , the plane .... " Cold as he was , his father understood . A thousand memories tied him to the little bird , a lifetime 's pride . Sadly he nodded . " Do it . " Gary rushed to the fire and pulled out a flickering branch . " This has to work . " Gary 's hands shook as he set the burning wood under the fuelsoaked wing . The canvas fabric shriveled as the flame ignited the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side . Together they watched the crumpled aircraft disappear in an oily cloud . The flame burned hot , melting the snow at the edge of the pit . It also burned fast . Within minutes the fire had died to a smoldering pile of blackened tubing , the welcome warmth dying with it . Gary shivered . " You tried , Gary . You tried . " His father 's voice was a lost whisper . SUDDENLY , lights speared the dark , followed by the whine of engines . Five snowmobiles screamed over the darkening landscape , tracing Gary 's tortured path . Nichols 's team swung around the remains of the fire and shut down their sleds . " I do n't believe it , " Nichols said , pulling off his helmet . " Is he alive ? " Gary nodded . " Yeah , but he 's hurt ... and cold . " " We 'll have the chopper here in 15 minutes . " Nichols crawled off his machine to wrap a blanket around the injured man . He glared at Gary , angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did almost got you killed . " " But ... " Gary started to explain , then went silent , too cold to care . " Guess we can save the chewingout until you 've thawed out . " Nichols clapped him on the shoulder . " Lucky it worked out . " Gary nodded , looking at his father . They knew it was more than just luck. * <p>
