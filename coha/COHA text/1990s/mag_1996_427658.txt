<p> Apple Computer is poised to start selling a radically new operating system that might be better than anything you have used before . To take advantage of it , you would have to toss out a lot of hardware , software and learning . Are you prepared to do that ? <p> " ONE DAY , everything Bill Gates has sold you up to now , whether it 's Windows 95 or Windows 97 , will become obsolete , " declares Gilbert Amelio , the boss at Apple Computer . " Gates is vulnerable at that point . And we want to make sure we 're ready to come forward with a superior answer . " <p> Bill Gates vulnerable ? Apple would swoop in and take Microsoft 's customers ? Ridiculous ! Impossible ! In the last fiscal year , Apple lost $816 million ; Microsoft made $2.2 billion . Microsoft has a market value thirty times Apple 's . <p> Outlandish and grandiose as Amelio 's idea sounds , it makes sense for Apple to think in such big , bold terms . Apple is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> It 's a bit like a patient with a probably terminal disease deciding to take a chance on an untested but promising new drug . A bold strategy is the least risky strategy . As things stand , customers and outside software developers alike are deserting the company . Apple needs something dramatic to persuade them to stay aboard . A radical redesign of the desktop computer might do the trick . If they think the redesign has merit , they may feel compelled to get on the bandwagon lest it leave them behind . <p> Lots of " ifs , " but you ca n't accuse Amelio of lacking vision . Today 's desktop machines , he says , are ill-equipped to handle the coming power of the Internet . Tomorrow 's must accommodate rivers of data , multimedia and multitasking ( juggling several tasks simultaneously ) . <p> We 're past the point of upgrading , he says . Time to scrap your operating system and start over . The operating system is the software that controls how your computer 's parts ( memory , disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web browsers . Once you 've done that , buy new applications to go with the reengineered operating system . <p> Amelio , 53 , brings a lot of credibility to this task . His rsum includes both a rescue of National Semiconductor from near-bankruptcy and 16 patents , including one for coinventing the charge-coupled device . <p> But where is Amelio going to get this new operating system ? From Be , Inc. , in Menlo Park , Calif. , a half- hour 's drive from Apple 's Cupertino headquarters , a hot little company founded by ex-Apple visionary Jean-Louis Gasse . Its BeOS , now undergoing clinical trials , is that radical redesign in operating systems that Amelio is talking about . Married to hardware from Apple and Apple cloners , the BeOS just might be a credible competitor to Microsoft 's Windows , which runs on IBM-compatible hardware . <p> Be , Inc. , only six years old , showed up just in time . Apple 's own effort to produce a revolutionary OS advance has foundered , and the man responsible for leading that effort , Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears that Apple will pay a large sum to acquire rights to the Be operating system . If Apple buys Be outright-for a sum that would probably top $100 million-it will reacquire an inspired product designer who could reignite the sort of fanaticism that defined Apple 's customer base in its early days . Gasse , a 52-year-old French mathematician , spent nine years at Apple before quitting to found Be . Apple is n't prepared to announce a deal with Be before a Dec. 4 board of directors meeting . But here is the gist of what is likely to happen : <p> Apple buys or licenses the new Be operating system . This is a futuristic piece of software designed to take advantage of high-bandwidth applications like rummaging through an Internet loaded with pictures , voice and video . The Be operating system is blended with some features from Copland , the half-completed project that Apple has been working on as a next-generation operating system . The blend-let 's call it Be-Mac-may end up looking a lot more like Be than Copland . <p> Besides strength in multimedia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer containing not one but two or more brains , or microprocessors . Apple is already selling dual-processor machines . Equipped with BeOS , these high-powered boxes would make multitasking a lot easier , faster and more crash-proof than it is on today 's machines . <p> With this equipment , you could , for example , simultaneously have your Web browser downloading a giant video file in the background while you type away on a memo in the foreground . Or you could be receiving a fax while reading a memo and watching a basketball game in the corner of your screen . Or you could run a four-way video conference call . Your computer screen might show three faces and a budget spreadsheet that the four of you are simultaneously editing . <p> For the moment , BeOS is built to run best on PowerPC chips . These chips , rivals to Intel 's Pentium line , power most of today 's Apple Macintoshes . Later , Be , Inc. ( or the Be division of Apple ) would rewrite its huge OS , creating a new version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could sell software into the IBM-compatible world , a vastly larger market than the Apple market . That is precisely where it could hurt Bill Gates and Microsoft . <p> Amelio 's ultimate goal : with or without owning Be , get half of Apple 's revenues from software over the next several years , up from some 10% now . <p> What about the old Mac operating system , the one that runs the existing 25 million Apple Macintoshes ? It will continue on as a ghost on new Macs-the new operating system will be able to imitate its features . Programs that run on the old Mac OS survive as a relic , much like the dusty albums that can still be played on the turntable connected to your CD-equipped stereo . <p> This much is clear : Amelio is gambling that customers and software developers will be willing to invest in a new operating system . If they wo n't , Apple 's future is dismal . <p> Will they ? It 's too early to say how computer users will react to the new Be-Mac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a so-called beta version . <p> As for developers , Be claims that 1,000 are working on programs for BeOS , although we could n't get any big developers to say they are in that group . Microsoft , of course , is the biggest application software company as well as the biggest OS publisher . Is Microsoft going to write programs to run with Be ? Its coy answer : We will if enough computer users want it . <p> Here 's the old chicken-and-egg problem of computer platforms . You get users on board if there are a lot of applications . But developers will write the applications only if there are a lot of users to sell to . <p> One way to get the ball rolling : Invite competition on the hardware side , by publishing the engineering specifications for the computer . Such an " open " system goes a long way to explaining the triumph of the IBM-compatible PC : For the past 15 years , PC developers who write a new program have been writing it not just for IBM 's customers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a score of other clonemakers . Given the huge cost of developing a new game or word processor or editing program , it makes sense to go after the fattest markets first . A lot of software developers do n't even bother to write for the Macintosh any more . <p> Apple belatedly opened the Macintosh to cloning in 1994 , when Michael Spindler was chief executive . Since Spindler was bounced in February and Gil Amelio brought in from National Semiconductor , there has been even more encouragement of cloning . It fits right in with Amelio 's plan to rely less and less on hardware for profits . <p> Power Computing , which has been selling Macintosh clones since May 1995 , plans to start selling a powerful two-processor version for $1,500 . Beginning in January , your box will come with both Mac OS and BeOS . DayStar and Umax are already selling two-processor Mac clones . Motorola , the chip company that makes a lot of the PowerPC microprocessors produced today , already has gotten into the computer business with a Macintosh-like machine . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One reason might be to get better mileage out of the time you spend trolling the Internet . With bad software , the browser preoccupies the processor , even if the processor is doing little but twiddling its thumbs while waiting for a huge picture file to come over the telephone line . You want to be able to have the browser working in the background while you move on to other tasks . BeOS ' partisans claim it 's better than Windows 95 at this kind of task juggling . Windows NT is good at multitasking but ca n't smoothly display multiple activities on one computer screen . <p> But here is the catch : This powerful new OS can work its magic only at the expense of being incompatible with old software . If you want one of these cool new machines , and if you want to avail yourself of all its powers , be prepared to throw out your old software and start over . <p> Will customers stand for this ? Maybe . Music lovers did , after all , put aside their record collections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once survived a platform upheaval . <p> In 1984 Apple all but abandoned the popular Apple II and introduced an incompatible machine called the Macintosh . At first , consumers and software developers were furious . Critics predicted Apple 's demise . But soon developers created software for the Mac , and people started buying Macs . The Mac was special : You controlled the machine with a point-and-click mouse rather than with cumbersome coded commands . The mouse was a feature then unknown in the Microsoft world . The Mac 's facility with graphics made it indispensable for certain jobs , like desktop publishing . In time , the platform developed a cult following . <p> Six years later , Microsoft copied many of the Mac 's innovations with its Windows 3.1 operating system . But note the important difference : Microsoft never encouraged its customers to discard their investment in old software . Bill Gates has painstakingly led his customers through operating system upgrades one step at a time , at no point leaving old application programs stranded . DOS 5 was compatible with DOS 3 , Windows 3.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This gradual upgrading process ca n't go on indefinitely , says Gil Amelio . In a recent interview , his first with a business magazine since taking over , he made the case for a radical redesign of the computer . <p> " At some point , you have to make the break , " Amelio says . Gasse says : " Where we can compete is precisely where Macintosh and Windows have limitations-in high-bandwidth applications . The good news for those systems is that they work with legacy software . The bad news is that they have baggage . That 's why , in the creation of digital media , there is still no Microsoft . " <p> Amelio 's view : Windows 95 , no matter how good it looks today , still rides on a shaky Model T frame known as DOS , a holdover from the days when computers talked not in pictures but in code , and when their memory was so puny they could n't handle file names more than seven letters long . Microsoft has done wonders in hiding that frame behind plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can squeeze onto a Model T , and software developers suffer in consequence . <p> Amelio is convinced that Gates will eventually have to abandon his platform and produce one that is largely incompatible with it . Before that happens , Amelio wants Apple to have a credible alternative . " Gates will deny this , " says Amelio , " but he is very anxious to get 100% of the OS market because when he absolutely cuts you off and moves into the new world , he does n't want to worry about losing customers . <p> " My objective is to put the best operating system out there , far better than anything Microsoft has got . That means making some significant architectural shifts . " Amelio is n't claiming that Apple can put Microsoft out of business . He 's betting that a new operating system will enable Apple to reverse decisively the decline in market share that has dropped it from 16% to 7% of the U.S. desktop market . <p> The Microsoft empire does n't buy this line of argument . " We are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silverberg , Microsoft 's senior vice president in charge of the Internet platform and tools division . " We recognize how big a market we have to sell into , and that 's why we are so focused in developing it . " That market includes millions of customers who do n't want to toss their old equipment . <p> Indeed , Microsoft has been remarkably adept at upgrading its software without losing customers . For a while , Windows NT , a high-strength version of Windows aimed at the corporate market , was something of an architectural shift from earlier Microsoft products . It did n't sell well . So Microsoft made compromises , to make NT more compatible with other Microsoft products , says James Allchin , senior vice president of Microsoft 's desktop and business systems . NT is now a big winner , gaining on other operating systems for corporate networks like Unix and Novell 's NetWare . Says Allchin , countering Amelio 's argument that computer users will soon have to throw away their existing operating systems : " Discontinuity does n't work well in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secondary consideration at Apple . The first consideration is survival . Apple does n't have the momentum of a huge installed base to carry it along . One in five households has a Mac ; four in five have a PC . <p> Amelio did what he could to save Apple with cost-cutting , eking out a surprise $25 million net income in the September quarter by laying off 10% of his employees , eliminating half of the product lines and paring down inventory . But he ca n't rebuild the company with cost cuts . There has to be a reason for buying an Apple rather than a Wintel machine . Be-Mac could be that reason . <p> What 's to be done for the loyal Apple customers who are in the market for new hardware and are excited about Be-Mac , but are not prepared to replace all their old applications with new Be-Mac versions ? Or for new Apple customers who do n't want to wait for the new Be-Mac versions of important applications to come out ? Amelio does not plan to leave either of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by former IBM executive Ellen Hancock , has come up with an " emulator " that can act as a simultaneous translator between software like Be-Mac and old applications that speak a different OSlanguage . You layer this emulator software on top of Be-Mac and it enables Be-Mac to understand commands aimed at Mac OS . The old applications , that is , can run on a machine where Be-Macis in control . <p> Trouble is , emulators have had a long and sorry history in the computer business . One such program , called SoftPC , is supposed to let a Macintosh run software written for an IBM . It does that , but the IBM software ( Word for Windows , for example ) runs achingly slow . The reason is that the Macintosh has to take every command ( like fetching data from memory ) that Word intends for an Intel processor and add three to ten more commands to it , so that a PowerPC chip knows what to do . <p> Hancock says her emulator wo n't be so handicapped . BeOS , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PowerPC chip . Therefore , the computer does n't need to laboriously interpret commands meant for one chip and rewrite them for another . All that needs to be translated are some commands aimed at the operating system itself , like " print . " <p> In fact , developers we talked to say that their old Mac OSprograms run a bit faster on BeOS than on Mac OS . " It makes your jaw drop , " says Richard Zulch , chief technology officer at Dantz Development , a developer of software for making backups of files . Mark Kriegsman , president of ClearWay Technology , which sells server software , agrees . " You will still see a net performance gain , even in emulation , " he says . <p> If and when developers like these rewrite their applications to take full advantage of Be-Mac 's powers , the improvement should be even more stunning . And if you run a new Be-Mac version of an application on a new multiprocessor Apple-well , presumably it will blow your socks off . <p> Amelio 's hope , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Apple hardware , the new Be-Mac operating system and new Be-Mac-flavored application programs . He plans to offer a bridge between old and new if the customers go only halfway . <p> Apple plans to make its new OS available not just on future Mac and Mac clone computers , but on store shelves as well . That way it targets not just the 7% market share that Apple currently has , but the 60 million Windows users who might want to buy Be-Mac , optimized for the Intel chip , for their PCs . Later might come versions for the Sun workstation or the Digital alpha chip . <p> How about the application developers ? Will they be inspired to pour money into creating Be-Mac versions of their programs ? Only if they are persuaded Be-Mac will sell better than the present Mac system and gain market share . " They have to convince the world that Be-Mac will cause a significant increase in volume , " says Alan Lefkof , chief executive of Farallon Communications , a vendor of Internet-related software and modems . " If Be simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very good return on investment for developers . " <p> Like most developers , Lefkof is already investing the money to write applications in four different operating system versions : Windows 3.1 , Windows 95 , Windows NT and Mac OS . He 's not thrilled to be writing in a fifth . <p> But here 's some good news for Apple . In November , Metrowerks , an Austin , Tex . tool developer , announced that it had come up with a piece of software that automates up to 80% of the work involved in converting Mac OS programs to the BeOS format . <p> Still , developers are waiting to see . John Warnock is the chief executive of Adobe Systems , vendor of the desktop publishing software that for many years has been one of the chief motivations for people to buy Apple computers . He says : " If there is a value proposition that customers can relate to , if it is cheaper , better , faster , easier to use , if it solves my software design problems , and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new operating system could be very interesting . " <p> More " ifs , " lots more . <p> It 's hard to overestimate the challenge that confronts Amelio , Gasse and Hancock . Microsoft is much more entrenched now than it was when the Macintosh came out . In the 12 years since , Bill Gates ' firm has grown nearly three hundred fold . Look at the billion dollars or so that IBM poured into OS/2 Warp . The rival operating system was said to be technically superior in many ways to what Microsoft had at the time , but that did n't stop Microsoft 's marketers from running circles around IBM . <p> Today , under Amelio , Apple seems to be on firmer footing than it was a year ago , when other business magazines were saying that Apple would have to be either liquidated or absorbed by a much bigger firm . <p> For one thing , the wolf is n't at the door . Apple is sitting on $1.7 billion in cash and short-term notes . Fred D. Anderson , Apple 's chief financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another profitable quarter for December , but he says he is confident that Apple will be profitable in the quarter ending Mar. 31 and thereafter . " I think it is very important that Apple undercommit and overdeliver , " he says . <p> Taking on Microsoft is a daunting challenge and a bold gamble . But only a bold gamble can save Apple . <p> Apple 's long journey 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple with $1,350 1977 Apple II draws buy orders at $1 million annual rate 1978 Sales up tenfold 1979 Apple II+ introduced at $1,200 1980 Apple raises $101 million  --  largest new issue since Ford in 1956 1981 IBM introduces the PC 1982 Compaq founded ; clones the PC in a year 1983 Apple hires John Sculley as chief executive 1984 Apple introduces the Macintosh , with clean-slate operating system 1985 Sculley holds out against cloning the Mac 1986 Packard Bell begins making dirt-cheap PC clones 1987 Mac II , with 1-meg RAM , 40-meg hard drive , priced at $5,500 1989 Sculley still against clones 1990 Michael Spindler becomes president 1991 Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 Microsoft introduces Windows 3.1 1993 Apple introduces Newton " personal digital assistant " to derisory reviews ; Spindler replaces Sculley 1994 Spindler approves cloning strategy 1995 Apple 's market share rises , but gross margin drops to 26% , producing $69 million loss in December quarter 1996 Gilbert Amelio replaces Spindler , bets on new OS <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Bill Gates with an inset photo of Gilbert Amelio <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Be , Inc . Chief Executive Jean-Louis Gassee . To save Apple he had to leave it . <p> By Nikhil Hutheesing <p> BETTER BROWSING ? <p> ENOUGH OF THIS TALK of the battle between Microsoft and Netscape for the Internet market . Apple is determined to have its own piece of the action . " We 're going to start winning the battles , " promises Apple chieftain Gil Amelio , pounding on the table in his office . <p> Apple Computer does not intend to offer an all-purpose browser that would compete head-on with Microsoft 's Explorer or Netscape 's Navigator . Rather , Amelio has in mind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Internet spider ( Yahoo , Lycos , etc. ) leaves off . The Apple searcher , to be sold beginning next year , would rummage through both your E-mail and the mishmash of files that an Internet spider has retrieved for you . The searcher would be able to group the E-mail into priorities , so that you would n't first have to wade through junk mail before getting to memos from your boss . That much is fairly common in existing E-mail programs . But the Apple product is also intended to second-guess the priority ranking of Internet files as calculated by the spider . <p> Here 's another innovation : The Apple program can summarize an E-mail message . It does that by indexing every word in a message , counting ones that are common in the message ( like " blueprint " ) but not counting the ones that are common in English ( like " that " ) , then hunting for a few sentences containing many of those key words . The summarization feature would be coupled with standard software that reads English aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages . <p>
