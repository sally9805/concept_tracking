How to pick the hardware that makes the room . // * Appliances are the workhorses of every kitchen , so it pays to seek out the best you can afford , with the features you most want . The key , as always , is in matching features to lifestyle and space , within an established budget . While this may seem to be the very definition of compromise , there are enough options and prices on the market these days to satisfy just about everyone . Microwave ovens Microwave ovens are a sign of the times , or should we say , the lack of time . What they offer is impressive speed and convenience for the price of a cheap TV . It 's easy to understand why close to 95% of all new and remodeled kitchens have a microwave . If you have n't looked at microwaves lately , you 'll find a few new features . For starters , today 's models have child lockouts with keypad releases . Other improvements include automatic defrosting and a range of programmed power and time settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , popcorn and packaged dinners . Some models even organize foods by ethnic category , such as Chinese and Italian , and cook accordingly . While these features can be handy , the real differences are in power , capacity , cooking sensors and convection-heat options . Power is measured in watts , starting at 600 and ending near 1000 . More power means shorter cooking times . You probably wo n't want less than 700 watts because the recommended cooking times for packaged foods assume at least that amount . Power is usually coupled with size . Upgrade power and you 'll usually get a larger cabinet , plus a carousel , which eliminates the need to stop and stir . Cabinets start at around 1/2 cu . ft. and end near 1.3 cu . ft . Many models these days have builtin sensors that prevent food from overcooking . The sensors are designed to monitor moisture levels . When a sensor determines that a meal has shed most of its water through cooking , it signals that the meal is ready to serve , and it 's usually right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be browned without moving to a conventional oven before serving . The most impressive thing about microwave ovens is that so many features are squeezed into such a narrow price range , which starts under $200 and peaks just over $400 . Fifteen years ago , we paid $400 to $500 for a good deal less . Dishwashers Dishwashers also continue to improve , with the emphasis on quiet operation , energy and water conservation , and more versatile loading features , plus some electronic wizardry on the high side . As with microwave ovens , prices have held surprisingly steady for years . For $300 to $500 , you can still buy a very good dishwasher , and one that is more efficient and convenient than a comparable machine built just a few years ago . Price is still a good indicator of quality . For $400 , you 'll get quality , no matter which brand you choose , while $179 buys something closer to a wet/dry storage cabinet . If you want a dishwasher that will clean all but the most caked-on , dried-on foods , without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three wash levels , built-in food strainer/ grinders and at least three cycles , for light- , normal- and heavy-soil loads . Some models offer as many as six . Beyond these essentials , look for a lower rack that has at least some folddown tines-which allow easier loading of large items-a 2-tiered upper rack and a compartment with a lid for small items , such as plastic lids and measuring spoons , which seem to leap onto the heating element the moment you close the door . And finally , if your kitchen opens onto a family room , look for quiet operation , which is accomplished with , among other features , better insulation and cushioned mounting brackets . These units typically have the word " quiet " or " whisper " in their model names . Electronic controls and sensordriven , fuzzy-logic microprocessor* are also available at a price . Electronic touch-pad controls are attractive . reliable , convenient and easy to clean around , but have no real effect on performance . They also cost more than rotary dials and pushbuttons . Refrigerators Refrigerators of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are measured . Many 30- , 40- and even 50-year-old refrigerators are still in use . They may not be particularly convenient or efficient , but they keep doing what they were made to do , year in and year out , often without the slightest hint of regular maintenance . What does past reliability have to do with current models ? Two points , really . First , refrigerators are still simple appliances , consisting of a compressor , refrigerant coil and an insulated box with shelves . And , as such , the marketing focus these days is on size , storage features , door shapes and addons , such as water dispensers and ice makers . What this means , until recently at least , is that you can buy a basic model and be reasonably sure that it will last as long as an expensive model . While that 's probably still true , the overall picture has changed slightly . Starting this year , manufacturers are no longer allowed to use ozonedepleting freon or plastics made with high-concentrations of CFCs . Manufacturers can sell existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably this year only , you can choose between a traditional model , which runs on freon , or a new freon-free model , which has no track record . It 's a tough choice , but a temporary one . Today 's refrigerators range between $370 and $2000 ( up to $5000 for commercial models favored by some ) , with $600 to $900 models offering the features most of us want . When shopping for refrigerators , make size and compartment options your top prior ( Please turn to page 80 ) ities . Sizes range from a stingy 13 cu . ft. to a whopping 28 cu . ft . Photograph // As a rule , upright models , with both upper or lower freezer compartments , are less costly to buy and to operate . Most come with ice makers or are wired and plumbed to accept retrofit kits . While the freezer space is usually smaller than that of a side-by-side , it often provides more convenient storage and access . Side-by-sides are more costly , but offer features like through-the-door water and ice dispensers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work well in galley kitchens or across from other appliances with doors . Other options to look for are adjustable glass shelves with spill-containing edges , temperature-controlled meat keepers ( adjustable to several degrees cooler than the surrounding space ) , humidity-controlled produce drawers and door racks deep enough to hold 1-gal. jugs . As for operating costs , you should pay close attention to the yellow energy-rating tags . All models are not equal . Assuming a national average of 8.76 cents per kilowatt-hour , annual energy consumption can range between $50 and $130 . Electric ranges Like other standard kitchen appliances , electric ranges have been around long enough to have the bugs worked out . Any model you buy will put dinner on the table . So the difference is in the details , and just as often , in the detailing . Solid-white models generally cost a little more than black-and-white models . Some have dial temperature controls while others have electronic keypads , and some have textured finishes while others are smooth . Most are priced between $350 and $900 , with commercial lookalikes , sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences are in burner types . The most popular ranges are still those with external heating coils , though smooth-top , hidden burners are gaining ground . External coils cost less , are easy and inexpensive to replace , heat faster and tolerate warped pan bottoms . Smooth tops are more attractive , easier to clean and offer extra workspace when not in use . Smooth-top ranges cost roughly $200 more than those with coils , and the burners are more costly to replace , requiring professional installation . Baked-on spills also require a special cleaner . And finally , some ranges come with solid cast-iron disc burners that are sealed into the cook-top . The advantage is that boil-over spills are kept from seeping under the cook-top , which makes cleaning easier . Beyond burner types , look for ranges that have accessible controls-even with large pans in place-large self-cleaning ovens , a window in the oven door , delay-start timers , lift-up tops and easy-to-clean surfaces . Gas ranges Many of the features offered on electric ranges are available on gas ranges . Gas is said to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better control . While it 's not true that gas burners heat faster , they can be adjusted quicker . In most cases , gas also costs less . Even with these advantages , gas ranges are not for everyone . They are almost always more expensive , and usually substantially so . A reasonably well-equipped gas range will cost $600 to $800 , while a similarly equipped electric model will cost $400 to $500 . And because gas appliances are more complicated , they often require more service and repair . Separate cook-tops and ovens Separate cook-tops and ovens are popular today because they offer greater versatility in workspace layout , especially when two cooks are involved . This option also allows for two standard ovens , or one standard oven and a warming oven . Cook-tops that are 36 in. or wider can support up to six burners or grille and griddle inserts with downdraft ventilation . For those with both utilities available , separate components also allow for a gas cook-top and electric oven , considered by some the best combination . Separate components , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks are attracted to the look , control and capacity of commercial appliances . Truly commercial ranges are not usually allowed in residential applications , however , because of their excessive heat output . When commercial units are allowed , commercial building codes apply , often including overhead sprinklers , extra ventilation and fire stops . A few manufacturers have adapted the best features of commercial appliances to residential dimensions , weights and heat clearances . If gourmet cooking is your passion , these offer the best of both worlds , but at a price . A couple of these hybrids-like a big range and refrigerator-can easily run $15,000 . Ventilation Cooking creates a lot of steam , heat smoke and atomized grease , which are best vented outdoors . Gas appliances also produce exhaust gases , which are better expelled . When shopping for a vent hood , focus on capacity and power . Shallow 6-in. hoods simply do n't have the holding capacity of deep hoods and , as a result , allow too much smoke and steam to escape into the room . If you do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling power of 200 to 250 cfm . When possible , avoid vent hoods that do not vent outdoors . These are primarily grease catchers . <p>
