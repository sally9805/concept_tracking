The movies ' most memorable new face does n't belong to a gorgeous thing named Gwyneth or Liv . It is n't all that pretty or even that new , seeing as its possessor , actor-auteur Billy Bob Thornton , is 41 and has been kicking around films for a decade . But those who have seen Thornton as Karl Childers in Sling Blade ca n't get that face out of their bad dreams . The skin is celibate smooth , the eyes clamped shut to keep the demons out , or in . And when the pursed mouth opens , it speaks , in a barrelly bass , of dreadful sins and Old Testament vengeance . Karl is a slow-witted killer  --  he murdered his mother and her lover when he was 12  --  with the visage of a fallen angel in private , permanent pain . <P> The beautifully felt performance behind that face ought to earn Thornton , who also wrote and directed Sling Blade , an Oscar nomination or two next week . The tale of Karl 's return home after 25 years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat his crime , has already turned the actor into Hollywood 's guy du jour . Clint Eastwood , Elizabeth Taylor , Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise are vocal fans of the film , and Thornton 's fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton is expected to screen it at the White House soon . A perennial supporting player , Thornton is now getting fat roles in A pictures : as Sean Penn 's nemesis in Oliver Stone 's U-Turn and as James Carville , more or less , in the Mike Nichols film Primary Colors . " He 's a redneck artist , " says Nichols . " Like Nicholson , Travolta and Whoopi Goldberg , he can play street characters with enormous intellect . He has a genius for connecting with people . " <P> Not bad for a man who spent years in medium- and no-budget films ( Remember Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ? ) , playing bad ole boys and inbred rubes with names like Coldface , Lightning and ( twice ! ) Billy Bob .

" I did n't win , but it was absolutely an honor to be nominated . " <P> His name may have helped Thornton get that japish citation , just as it may have hurt his early chances for serious roles ( " And the Oscar goes to  --  Billy Bob who ? " ) . But that has been his name since his youth , in Malvern , Arkansas , where Dad was a basketball coach and Mom was a fortune teller with , Thornton says , true psychic powers . The lad was unusual even then , says his boyhood friend Tom Epperson . " My nickname for him was Silly Slob . " <P> After various gigs as a musician , including drummer in a ZZ Top-knockoff band called Tres Hombres , Thornton figured he and Epperson could strike it rich in New York City ( that visit lasted all of 10 hours ) and then Los Angeles . Together they wrote Thornton 's eye-catching role as the white-trash murderer in One False Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1991 , Thornton is never scarier than when he smiles  --  the picture of boll-weevil evil . He 's good at that . " Billy can organize all the madmen inside himself , " says John Ritter , the Three 's Company refugee who gets a career makeover as a gentle gay man in Sling Blade . " If Horton Foote and David Lynch ran at each other at 100 m.p.h. and collided head on , the result would be someone like Billy Bob . " In his spare moments , Thornton got married . Four times .
