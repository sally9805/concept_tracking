<p> A hush fell over the Alabama dining room on an autumn Friday night in 1981 . A sign of respect for the president of the United States or some visiting royalty ? <p> No . The Bear walked into the room . <p> " I was talking to a friend on the staff where all the players were eating . All of a sudden the place went quiet . I turned around and looked and coach Bryant came through the room . That was that . The players and the coaches in the room all concentrated on getting done with eating and getting into the Friday night meetings , " said Chuck Neinas , executive director of the Boulder-based College Football Association . <p> " It was an entirely different time period . Those coaches were just held in awe by their players . There was never any player at Ohio State or Alabama who ever thought about talking back to ( Woody ) Hayes and ( Bear ) Bryant . It was the crewcut era , " Neinas paused , realizing short hair is back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Division I-A football lists only 14 coaches , five of whom are still active , with at least 200 career wins . ( Lou Holtz will join the elite circle with Notre Dame 's first win this fall ) . Only three , Paul Bryant ( 323 ) Pop Warner ( 319 ) and Amos Alonzo Stagg ( 314 ) made it to 300 wins , and the latter two did it in the leather-helmet era at some schools which no longer play football . <p> Those I-A lists do n't include Grambling 's Eddie Robinson , going for his 400th win in this , his 54th season . <p> " Coaching has changed tremendously , " said former Ohio State and Colorado State coach Earle Bruce , who led a first-year Arenaball franchise to its division championship this summer . " Woody loved the game of football he loved the game and the people he coached with his life . We changed that . The coach-player relation has changed . " <p> Never mind the days of no earrings ( or tattoos ) , Coaches today are nostalgic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many recall unlimited scholarships . If a school 's admission office required only a pulse , there was no need to lose sleep over 17-year-olds passing the SAT . If a junior was outstanding , odds were he would become an even better senior before the NFL came calling . <p> The college playing field has indeed been leveled . It 's hard to imagine a new-generation Bryant rising as a mountain above the landscape . Current coaching legends such as Tom Osborne ( 219 victories ) , Joe Paterno ( 269 ) or Bobby Bowden ( 249 ) are at the pinnacle of their careers , but at ages 58 , 68 and 65 , respectively , they are headed toward the twilight of their reigns . <p> " With the increase in academic requirements , the reduction in grants and the NFL taking the best juniors , coaching becomes much more difficult , " Neinas said . <p> As Bowden and Alabama know all too well , the NCAA no longer considers any program sacrosanct . And next year 's mega-conferences reduce the mathematical odds of conference titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigham Young . Next year , the WAC roster grows to 16 schools . Does anyone think Bo Schembechler and Hayes would have collected quite as many Rose Bowl trips if Penn State had been in the Big Ten ? <p> Edwards , who ran his career victory total to 207 last season , has n't been doing cartwheels over league expansion , but mostly frets about the academic impact . " When the grade-point requirement goes from 2.0 to 2.5 next year , it 's going to jerk a lot of guys out . It may injure Division I. I read where 60-70 percent of players who signed a year ago would n't be eligible under the new rule We 're dealing with 18- , 19-year-old kids . Who put in this rule ? " <p> So what does make a legend , besides the win column ? Neinas said : " I look at coaches who have not inherited great situations . What a person inherited and the obstacles he had to overcome deserve as much credit as record . There 's a lot more good coaches than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nine short of the 200-victory mark , suggests it 's a bygone magnetism that lured other coaches . " I went to Alabama at least 10 times , I worshiped at the shrine . " <p> Besides a turnaround , staying free of NCAA violations is a factor ( crossing Washington 's Don James and Auburn 's Pat Dye off the list of candidates ) a national championship or two , placing assistants in head-coaching positions ( Bryant had upwards of 50 ) and creating a shadow so big that few could ever hope to succeed him . <p> Bruce knows what it 's like to succeed a legend and he looks at Schembechler 's successor , Gary Moeller , as having the same misfortune . " That 's a sad story . It probably would n't have happened if he had a Rose Bowl champ instead of a 7-4 team , " said Bruce of Moeller 's firing this summer for an incident in an Ann Arbor bar . <p> Neinas was on a panel for a Kansas City newspaper naming an all-Big Eight team from 1958 on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska 's Bob Devaney and Osborne . Devaney built the program and Osborne sustained it . But Bob came up where there were unlimited scholarships and no Prop 48 . " <p> As for turnarounds , the most obvious is Colorado 's Bill McCartney , who took over a program that had all but forgotten its glory days . He turned a 1-10 nightmare in 1984 into a national championship in 1990 . Like Bryant , McCartney regularly changed offenses . McCartney averaged just less than 10 victories his last six years . Even if he duplicated that clip the remaining 10 years on his contract , McCartney , 93-55-5 , would have fallen short of 200 victories . <p> In the turnaround vein , Kansas State 's Bill Snyder reversed what was arguably one of the historically worst programs in the country , but the jury remains out after just three winning seasons . <p> Neinas points to West Virginia 's unsung Don Nehlen as one of the most underrated coaches in the country . " He 's in a state where there 's very few college prospects and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Often overlooked outside the Rocky Mountain region is Edwards . He has taken teams to 19 bowl games and has won a national championship . Some might dismiss the 207 victories - many chalked up against the New Mexicos and Texas-El Pasos . But certainly the revered Bryant , not to mention Osborne , had their automatic W 's . Some forget Edwards ' victims also include UCLA , Notre Dame , Colorado ( twice ) , Miami , Penn State , Michigan and Eric Dickerson 's SMU team . <p> Edwards said : " I never even thought about 200 wins until I read an article about Vince Dooley ( 201 ) . I was very surprised by the lack of numbers of coaches who attained it . I did n't know it was a milestone . " <p> But his players regard him as a legend . No one jokes about him , even behind his back . " It would be a taboo to make fun of such a legend , " said BYU running back Hema Heimuli . " When you play for a legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't second-guess him . " <p> Paterno , Osborne and Edwards are the exceptions today to longevity in college coaching . McCartney bowed out after just 12 years . Rich Brooks hung around Oregon for nearly two decades with some mediocre records , then one Rose Bowl appearance opened the NFL door . Dennis Erickson collected national championships at Miami at an amazing clip , but like Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma two decades earlier , skipped out for the NFL a step ahead of the NCAA posse . <p> Name the new breed and Terry Bowden immediately pops up for an outstanding two years with probation-strapped Auburn . The acid test comes this season , when the pressure is on to make a major bowl . <p> The new coaches are as different from the Bryant era as the players . " My analogy is the young group grew up in a more permissive society and are more like big brothers . The Paternos are more like fathers , " Neinas said . " ( The youth ) might help in recruiting but you still have to have someone to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an easy sport and practice is not fun . " <p> To that end , Notre Dame 's Holtz took his preseason camp to a spartan , off-campus site with no air-conditioning . Then there 's 34-year-old Rick Neuheisel , who sent his freshman class down Boulder Creek in inner tubes . <p> If Neuheisel wins , look for everyone to follow . If he loses , he might jump in Boulder Creek .
