The hottest video in Havana these days is seven hours long and boasts no Hollywood talent . But it has Communist Party faithful flocking into theaters to watch the star of the show savagely criticize Cuba 's food shortages and bungling bureaucrats . The headliner is none other than Fidel Castro 's younger brother Raul . For the party 's 500,000 card-carrying members , the uncut footage of Raul traversing Cuba from Santiago de Cuba to Pinar del Rio , chronicling political and economic woes , is a must see . And despite the occasional urge to nap , viewers exit stunned and uncertain what it portends for Cuba 's future . <P> Long hidden in the shadow of his taller , more charismatic brother , Raul has stepped into the spotlight this year as the champion of economic and agricultural reforms long opposed by Fidel . While Fidel was exhorting hungry Cubans with hoary slogans like " Socialism or death , " Raul went to the people last spring , asking party members and peasants alike about the government 's shortcomings . As economic woes mounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subbed for his brother and delivered the traditional July 26th speech commemorating the start of the Cuban revolution . And Raul pushed for the Oct. 1 reopening of free-enterprise farmers ' markets , which were shut down by Fidel in 1986 . " Beans , " declared the general , " are more important than cannons . " <P> While Fidel , 67 , remains Cuba 's ideologue of yesteryear , Raul , 63 , has emerged as today 's pragmatist . After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 cost Havana its main trading partner , Fidel has only grudgingly opened the door to dollar-toting tourists and foreign investors , begun shrinking the army and bureaucracy , and allowed Cubans a taste of private enterprise . But monthly rations barely provide enough food for two weeks . The Cuban army , in touch with grass-roots sentiment through its conscripts and ties with local militias , started telling Raul of widespread grumbling among the hungry populace . <P> Public anger bubbled over this summer when 32,000 Cubans fled the island in makeshift rafts . Fidel , shocked and hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerned that his 180,000 troops would be called upon to put down popular protests , decided the stalemate between reformers and hard- liners had dragged on too long . Food had become a national-security issue , more important than possible political squabbles . In July , at a Communist Party meeting , Raul said , " The risks do n't matter as long as there is food for the people . " By late summer he had apparently persuaded Fidel to let the army take over decisions about food production from civilian economists . <P> Raul 's ideas of reform are not necessarily the ones Western democracies would choose for Cuba . Basically , Havana is turning increasingly large chunks of the economy over to the military . Although it is rare to see uniformed soldiers on the street , Raul 's troops are involved in every aspect of the economy , from running plants to planting food . The general has plugged military men loyal to him  --  some retired , some still active  --  into influential positions . Professional soldiers who once earned battle medals as mercenaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , build tourist hotels and direct industrial production . Generals are donning civilian clothes to run quasi-private corporations , from tourist hotels to department stores .
