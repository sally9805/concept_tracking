The night for a big entrance is not one to test the micromini tube dress that 's tighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a splash , you might drown . Choose an outfit you 've had success with before . Clothes that need adjustment or feel like a costume will only make you doubt yourself . Once you enter , have a destination . Hesitation can mar even the most elegant premiere . If you do n't know a soul , head toward a person near the back of the room . Chances are you 'll find a friendly face along the way . " - Nancy Friday , author of Our Looks , Our Lives 2 They work the room " You first must learn to overcome minglephobia . Psych yourself up to enter a room : Picture everyone naked , except you , or pretend your husband or best friend is by your side , even if you 're solo . Then make your move . You can choose one of several approaches . The boldest is the honest method . ' If you do n't know anyone at the gathering , walk up to a group , smile widely , introduce yourself , and say : " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys ? ' This usually gets a warm , sympathetic reception , and people chat you up immediately . A less bold method and probably the most common is the fade-in . ' This involves edging up to a group , listening very carefully , then finding a way to interject yourself . It takes a little bluffing , but once you 're in , you 're home free . Once you 've mastered this approach , limit one-onone conversation to 5 to 15 minutes . To move on , simply say , Excuse me , I must get a drink . ' But watch this excusepeople may follow you . To break from the more clingy conversationalists , say , I 'm sorry . I have to make a phone call . ' Oddly enough , no one ever follows you to the phone . " - Miss Mingle ( a.k.a .

First , admit to forgetting the person 's name ; do n't try to play around it . Second , slap the palm of your hand to your forehead in mock horror and say , " I ca n't even remember my own mother 's name ! ' At this point , the other person will surely remind you of their name . Then simply say , " I promise never to forget it again , ' and move on . " - Etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige , author of Letitia Baldrige 's Complete Guide to the New Manners for the ' ' 90s 4 . They can tell a great story " Avoid phrasing your story as a joke . People think when they tell stories they have to get to a punch line , but punch lines are not in themselves amusing . You should have a deep personal interest or investment in your story-it should be either profoundly moving or profoundly funny . The story need n't ( continued ) have happened to the storyteller , so long as the storyteller is also deeply moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that it was a Wednesday is n't as important as the fact that it was a gray , cloudy day . Gesturing is fine so long as it comes about naturally , but a good story well told and full of conviction needs little adornment . The words are what 's most important . You need to nudge and cherish the language . There are more than a half billion words in the English language ; your goal should be to use them all before you die .

But more important , you should also take another slow , relaxing breath once you 've entered and taken your place in front of everyone . You wo n't lose their attentionwhen you 're standing right in front of them , that 's impossible . Then smile . People buy things from and listen to people who smile at them . " - Valerie Adami , director of programming at Weist-Barron School of Television Acting in New York 6 . They ask for a raise and get it " Wear your favorite suit and pay close attention to your hair and makeup on the day you want to ask for the raise . Then casually say to your boss at the start of the day , I 'd love a minute of your time today , ' letting him or her choose when the two of you will meet . When you 're face-to-face , set up your pitch . Say , " I really enjoy this job and working for you ' and list the specific contributions you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful advertising campaign , etc . Then take the plunge : Do you think you might consider giving me a raise ? ' Phrasing it this way allows the boss to be gracious and magnanimous . Do n't say " I want a raise , " or I 'm underpaid . ' It sounds accusatory . And do n't speak in specific numbers unless asked ( in which case you should have a ballpark figure prepared that reflects both the job market and salaries within your company ) . Finally , end the conversation with Please do n't feel pressure to answer right away . ' This lets your boss feel in control and perhaps especially generous when she offers you that raise in a couple of days ' time . " - Lauren Wiesenthal , partner at the New York legal search consulting firm Corrao , Miller , Rush , eF Wiesenthal They 're good hagglers " The key to getting a fair deal is to first do your homework . Pick up an issue of Consumer Reports , talk to friends , look for any information that will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really worth ( how much you love it does n't count ) . Once you 've done your research , purposely leave a little room to negotiate either way . Always ask for a little more or offer a little less than your limit . And when someone says , Trust me , ' do n't . If a car dealer tells you he 'll add on certain options as part of the deal , ask him to write it down as part of your agreement . If you 're still having doubts , take a night to think it over . A good night 's sleep never killed a deal . " - Michael Donaldson , author of Negotiating for Dummies 8 . They know how to overcome fear " Fear is a lot like pain-it 's your guide to pinpointing what 's bothering you . After I blew out my knee in a crash while training for a competition , jumps scared me , so I had to learn to replace my fear with a strategy . The best way I 've found is to rehearse the situation in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you feel the fear most intensely . Next , shift to something very calming ( for me , it 's a beach at sunset ) and as you do a mental run-through , breathe out , physically relaxing your body . Then imagine yourself going through the motions flawlessly while your body and mind are relaxed . This can apply to anything intimidating in your life . In essence , you 're conditioning your mind to replace fear with success . Then run that exact same scene over and over again in your head like a film on a loop . If you visualize something enough times , you 're going to do it just as you imagined . " - Picabo Street , Olympic skiing champion 9 . No one Intimidates them " Stop all the negative thoughts in your head , then visualize yourself pushing the other person 100 feet away from you . Imagine him or her as being very small and in black and white . This will immediately reverse any feeling of inferiority . Once you 've mentally laid the groundwork , you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in your control . Do n't say anything competitive or defensive ; instead , ask something personal like How is your family ? ' Be sincere and it will probably throw off the other person 's power-tripping ways . If he or she does start to hurl insults , do n't ignore it , but do n't let yourself become emotionally charged in the face of it . Remember , you 're not trying to win anything , you 're just trying to come out of the encounter with your head held high . " - Anankha K. Chandler , certified hypnotherapist and author of Therapist in a Box : Emotional Healing 10 . They can tell a joke " Never announce that you 're about to tell a joke ; it sets expectations too high and there 's a better chance you 'll fall flat . The joke should stem naturally from the conversation , so that people get sucked in before they even know you 're telling it . For the same reasons , do n't take a big dramatic pause before the punch line . But do take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you 've got the whole thing down pat . There 's nothing worse than stopping halfway through a joke and saying , Wait , did I mention that the bus driver has a wooden leg ? Because that 's really important . Let me start over . ' Whether you 're telling something that happened to a friend or something that happened last month , always say something like on the way over here ' instead and make them believe it just happened to you . People will get more emotionally invested when it 's more immediate . If your joke brings the house down , do n't press your luck with another one . Always leave them wanting a little bit more .
