Ross Perot was a bit tired . For months he had been traveling and making TV appearances at a more frenetic pace than when he was running for President , so he had been planning to take a break . Instead he abruptly decided to rush to Washington last Thursday to fulminate on the Capitol grounds against Bill Clinton 's budget . The program was moving through Congress faster than Perot had anticipated , so he personally displayed a truckload of petitions  --  bearing 2.5 million signatures by his count  --  demanding that Washington cut spending before raising taxes . Minority leader Bob Dole gave Perot 's show an unusual plug on the Senate floor . As Dole argued for his own doomed deficit-reduction plan , which contained no tax increases , he said , " Ross Perot has got the message . . . He 's been out among real people . " A dozen Republicans from both houses joined Perot 's photo op . They were eager to be seen with the rebel who savaged their own presidential candidate last year but is now the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun as they waited for Perot to appear were the latest weird scene in the marriage of convenience between the Dallas billionaire and the G.O.P. The alliance is an uneasy one . Many senior Republicans are worried that Perot 's advocacy group , United We Stand America , is a powerful weapon that he may aim at them whenever it suits his purpose . Dole has warned associates that the mercurial independent is a threat to the G.O.P. 's status as the focus of opposition to Clinton . William Bennett , like Dole a possible presidential candidate in 1996 , says , " It 's a big mistake for Republicans to legitimize Ross Perot , because sooner or later we 'll have to delegitimize him . " <P> Yet as long as Perot 's public standing remains robust , he is a magnet for politicians  --  particularly those up for election next year . Association with him draws publicity , builds up an independent image and helps in courting his local supporters , who may be pivotal in some House and Senate races next year . <P> A TIME/CNN poll completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Perot . Since February his favorable rating has declined , from 58% then to 51% now , probably because his harsh attacks on Clinton 's policies and persona make him seem too partisan to some people . But Perot 's numbers remain strong compared with Clinton 's wan ratings . Many voters are aware of Perot 's foibles  --  wobbling on issues and overreacting to criticism  --  but they like his anti-Washington message anyway . As a potential presidential candidate , Perot has actually pulled ahead of Clinton . In the survey , 46% said they would be very likely or somewhat likely to vote for the Texan ; for the President , the figure was 33% . <P> Months ago , the White House gave up its naive notion that Clinton might establish personal rapport with Perot . For the President to attack him frontally is also futile . So the Clinton circle is studying Perot 's constituency with extensive polling and focus groups , looking for ways to win over a large segment of it . The main conclusion : only when Clinton demonstrates that he can lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing from Perot 's minions .
