Days from Djanet , in the wild and mountainous desert of southeastern Algeria , the pickup blew a tire . A goat in the back lay down to die . My host , the driver , was a young nomad with rings on his fingers . He hauled the goat to its feet and Men mounted the spare tire and said , " Do n't worry . If you love a woman , she can never hurt you . The desert is my woman . " This alarmed me . I had another metaphor in mind . A vehicle in the Sahara is a life raft , and ours had sprung a leak : with the barest hiss the spare was losing air . We kept afloat only by working an old bicycle pump . I remembered a Frenchman who had assured me , " You are never alone in the desert . " Easy to say in Paris . but I already knew of people who had been too alone . You can lie for months here without being found . Short of that , solitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigated trackless valleys and sailed sand seas . We gave up on the goat , and abandoned its carcass to the shade of thorns . And finally we got to Djanet , a lovely oasis town at the foot of craggy cliffs . I have since become more objective , but at the time , I thought it was the most luxurious place on earth . There are other Saharas , some too tame . In Tunisia mass tourism has made a caricature of the desert and turned young men into pimps . I once joined a group of Spaniards there , and saw the land fast from behind glass . Our guide grappled with the age-old problem of what to do with a desert . He named rock formations-the " lion , " the " camel , " the " cathedral . " He sold dunes and traditions . He used superlatives without content . " At Tamerza is the most interesting waterfall . You absolutely must see it-everyone does . " The waterfall was unusual , perhaps . Also liquid and cool . We splashed in it and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of paid companions : he seemed to disdain other Tunisians , and secretly to despise us as well . He wanted us to admire the mirages , but there are mirages in Spain , too . The Spaniards felt excluded and unfulfilled . This was Tunisia , the impenetrable Sahara . Morocco is worse . Algeria is better , maybe because thirty years ago the Algerians threw the French out . Algerians have become proud and somewhat distant . If they are poor , they are not hungry . If they hustle each other , they do not bother strangers . In the vast south , which is the desert , they themselves are accustomed to travel . They are hospitable but not fawning . They appreciate their own solitude and respect that of others . They have not spoiled their desert : it is the real Sahara . Still , I can not recommend a vacation there without admitting that Algeria is troubled . After the near victory of the Islamic party in national elections , and a subsequent military crackdown , last year a low-grade civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand lives . The struggle is limited to the north , mostly to savagery between authorities and rebels in the capital , Algiers . To date foreigners have not been attacked . In fact the capital is worth a few nights on the way to the Sahara . It sparkles across hills on a blue Mediterranean bay . Though the suburbs boast a Hilton and a Sofitel , the best place to stay is the Es-Safir ( phone 011-213-273-5040 , fax 2737863 ) , a venerable colonial-era hotel in the city center , where for $40 you get a room with a high ceiling and a bath . Forget the museums and the beaches . Algiers is tense and watchful . The economy has gone underground . Walk the streets and study the face of resurgent Islam . You probably should stay out of the casbah this year . The calls to prayer sound like calls to action . But you can also skip the city center , and fly Air Algerie from Algiers to Djanet , two hours away by Boeing on a flight any day but Tuesday . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summer it runs an additional weekly flight directly from Paris to Djanet . The flight takes only four hours , but by some measures covers as great a distance as exists anywhere . Djanet stands at 3,600 feet at the base of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau , which rises almost twice as high . It is an old trading center for Tuareg nomads , the veiled warriors of the high desert . Because of its altitude , the area is not prohibitively hot , even in the summer , and nights are cold in the winter . The town is home to 10,000 people . It consists of villages built of stone which melt into the hillsides along a dry riverbed . It has an old French fort , a market , and a typical date palmery . You can easily spend a couple of days there , watching the Arabs , Tuaregs , and black Africans . Along the main street a shaded cafe serves tea and good strong coffee . The little restaurants wo n't make you sick . As elsewhere in the Sahara , the drinking water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the main hotel , a concrete box longingly named The Zeribas , after the airy stick-walled huts of tradition . Better to stay six miles out of town at the other hotel , called Tenere Villages , where a room for two costs $60 and includes breakfast . The hotel is run by Tenere Voyages , the most reputable guide service in the Algerian Sahara . This is convenient , because Djanet alone is not enough to see  --  you 'll want to poke around the desert . For $90 a day per person ( $50 for children ) Tenere Voyages includes the room , all meals , and a Toyota Landcruiser with driver . The price is based on there being four passengers per vehicle , and is the same whether you make day trips from the hotel or venture farther , camping in the desert . You may also travel by camel or by foot with pack mule . Though all this quickly becomes expensive , straying from Djanet without a guide and a good vehicle would be foolish . Tenere Voyages says it has never lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head office is in Ouargla , at 970-7562 , fax 970-2936 . Language is not a great obstacle . French is widely spoken , along with Arabic and Tamachek , the Berber dialect of the Tuaregs . English is less common , because American and British visitors are rare . But visitors talk too much anyway , and expect too much of their guides . Local people know less than they pretend to . You can learn more by reading a few books beforehand ( if you read French , you 'll want to look for the Guide Bleu Algerie , which is far and away the best guidebook available ; in English look for the out-of-print Search for the Tassili Frescoes , by Henri Lhote ) , and trusting the guides simply to navigate . In Algeria at least they do n't require you to ski the dunes and they do n't name the rocks . After a morning 's drive south from Djanet you come to a desert of scattered acacias , and to a canyon and a spring where nomads camp . The women may slip into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit with you for hours in silence and the buzzing of flies . The goats will bleat . The children will stare . Farther to the south and east , after a day or so of hard travel , the Sahara descends toward Niger and Libya into valleys so hot that the wind blows upward and sand dunes mount the canyon walls to escape . Nomads do not venture here . This is the Tadart , a wilderness within a wilderness , a desert of sculpted stone . It requires patience to visit : at midday you pass long hours sheltering from the sun under overhanging rocks ; at night , under the brilliant stars , you must reassure yourself that elsewhere life continues . I have tried , and been unable , in the Tadart to imagine Manhattan . Closer to Djanet lies Erg Admer , a sea of 300-foot dunes extending for more than a hundred miles toward the Hoggar Mountains . By Algerian standards Admer is a small erg , but its sand will line your horizons and fill your shoes . For all its size , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it changes . It is full of hidden worlds . The most compelling of them rises to the east , in the rugged Tassili plateau . Accessible only by steep cliffside trails , the Tassili contains one of the world 's great collections of prehistoric rock art . Rock drawings can be found in highlands throughout the Sahara , hundreds in the Tadart alone , but only here in the Tassili is there such a concentration  --  perhaps 400,000 Neolithic paintings and engravings , which together chronicle the human history of the Sahara . If you are physically tough , you can hike up to the closest site and back in a day . It 's better to pack in supplies and spend a week . The richest site is at Sefar , a two-day walk from the trailhead . And the Tassili is spectacular canyon-cut country . The art gives you an excuse to wander through it . People began to paint the rock there about 8,000 years ago , during a long wet spell . They drew gods with round heads , and illustrated a savannah roamed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crocodiles lurked , and there was good fishing near Djanet . Around 4000 B.C. new people arrived with domesticated cattle , bringing with them the finest period in Saharan art , the so-called Bovine : they drew realistic cows and graceful human beings . Because of similarities of hairstyle and village life , clearly shown on rock paintings , it seems likely that they were the ancestors of the modern Peul , herders of the Sahel . Speculation that they wrecked their homeland by overgrazing it seems unfair , since larger climatic forces were at work . After 2000 B.C. the desert began to return . The rivers dried up , and the African mammals drifted south . On a cliffside near Djanet an engraving shows a weeping cow . Around 1500 B.C. armed horsemen appeared , driving chariots at full gallop . They were Berbers from the north , and they took over . The art declined , and the desert deepened . Then , just before Christ , came the camel . It came from Arabia as a domesticated animal , and soon supplanted the horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable Tuaregs . This is not as improbable as it might seem . Horses do n't endure the hard desert , and wheels require roads . in a brilliant book titled The Camel and the Wheel ( 1990 ) , the Columbia history professor Richard W. Bulliet describes how camels came to dominate throughout North Africa and the Middle East . All that was required was an efficient camel saddle  --  and one was invented in northern Arabia a few centuries before Christ . It was excellent as both a packsaddle and a riding saddle . Afterward even the memory of the wheel was lost . Incidentally ( the problem with camels is the hump , which is made of fat and can not support a load . The first saddles went on behind the hump , since there was not enough space in front . But the rear was weak and wobbly . The northern-Arabian solution was a saddle that straddled the hump with a frame of inverted Vs . It allowed the camel to carry heavier packs , and it provided the rider with a high , stable perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was the invention that won the Arab world . It remains the packsaddle of the Sahara today . The rock art continues . The most recent works are primitive representations of trucks and Junkers trimotors . The Tuaregs know that the hoof has been surpassed . Still , they cling to their camels . For riding and making war , they have gone beyond the Arabs . They breed a tall , thin camel with a back so long that they can put their riding saddles before the hump . This places the rider low , within the upper reach of a horseman , but improves the handling . Tuaregs nestle their bare feet against their camels ' necks and direct the beasts with gentle pressure . If you go to Djanet , you might do the same , for the sake of history alone . <p>
