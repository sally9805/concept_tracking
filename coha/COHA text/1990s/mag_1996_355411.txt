It was last fall that the Microsoft advancemen first visited the little library in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn . They came down Flatbush Avenue , past the tropical-colored stalls of mangoes and plantains , past the discount-clothing stores , past the men slapping down dominoes on chipped stoops . They did not dally at the basketball hoop lashed to a tree in front of the library . Unlike some of the kids who played there every day , the Microsoft guys actually went up the steps and inside . <P> They had come to see whether the Flatbush branch of the Brooklyn Public Library ought to share in a $3 million grant that would wire it to the Internet . Donald Kaplan , who works for the library system , recalls that the emissaries from Redmond , Washington , were dubious : " One of them asked , ' Will this be like the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy , where a Coke bottle falls out of the sky and no one knows what to do with it ? ' " Kaplan shrugged off the gibe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie Field of Dreams  --  build it , and they will come . " <P> Which is what happened . They came on that opening day in April , and they have n't stopped coming . Nearly 8,000 people in 3 1/2 months signed up for half-hour sessions on the computers . So many folks wait for the library doors to open each morning  --  children as young as two , adults older than Bill Gates ' parents  --  that the staff had to put down green tape on the floor to mark off a place to line up for a turn on one of the dozen Pentium-chip computers in the Jell-O-blue reading room . <P> " When we started doing sign-ups , it got a little hairy , " says Donna Hubbard , the branch librarian . Arguments sometimes broke out . It 's obvious why , she says . Half the patrons are children dying for a chance on the machines . " Most of them do n't have PCs , " says Hubbard . Many of the local schools do n't either . <P> Flatbush has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of immigrants washes over another . And the library has always been central to their dreams  --  a haven where that critical ingredient to success , information , is dispensed for free . But now , as the millennium approaches and more knowledge comes down a wire than anyone could ever acquire from books , many people behave as if equipping libraries to serve the info-poor is some kind of novelty . <P> " I come in here almost every day to cruise the Net , " says Clifford Granthier , 20 . The young Haitian immigrant was among those who used to spend all day on the makeshift basketball court outside the reading room . But as word trickled out that you could find cool pictures of Michael Jordan and the Bulls on the Web , Granthier began spending more and more of his day in cyberspace . His circumnavigations led him to a new interest : desktop publishing . " I 'm inspired to start my own business , " he says . <P> But how ? He does n't have enough money even to buy a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own PC , one component at a time . " I found a site on the Net that shows you how to make one .
