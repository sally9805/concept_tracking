For a man in a box , Saddam Hussein manages to find an amazing amount of wiggle room . He is walled in by economic sanctions and no-fly zones and international inspectors , but he still pops out with one ploy after another calculated to thwart the U.N . and inflate his image in the Arab world . Like a stage magician , he fills his act with grand gestures and hoopla , but on close inspection the show can be seen for what it is : illusion . <P> Last week , with on-and-off help from his friends in the U.N . Security Council , Saddam produced a flurry of prestidigitation that was defiant and seemingly conciliatory at the same time . He demanded an end to U.N . inspections and sanctions in six months , threatened again to shoot down the U-2 reconnaissance plane that periodically photographs his key installations and then invited foreign diplomats and scholars to visit his presidential palaces as " guests " ( the same term he used for his hostages before the Gulf War ) . But of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission must stay out . <P> America 's allies often scold the U.S. for demonizing Saddam and needlessly personalizing the confrontation , but there is no question that he has become much more than an irritant . He has withstood all the sanctions the U.N . could pile on him , and thumbs his nose at the idea of being bombed again . His callousness seems to know no bounds . When UNICEF announced last week that a million Iraqi children have suffered from malnutrition under seven years of the embargo , Saddam acted to make their plight worse . He said he was uninterested in renewing an arrangement that allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine . Instead , he demands that all sanctions end . <P> The U.S. is continuing to build up its forces , mainly air power , in the gulf region but shows no eagerness to use them . How , then , can Saddam be forced to open his doors to the inspectors searching for his hidden arsenal of poison and germs ? As Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary William Cohen both stressed last week , the issue is not just Iraq . It is how the world will try to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction for decades to come . <P> The U.N . inspectors were at work again in Iraq last week , busy getting a fix on what mischief had been done during their three weeks off the job . They were probing warehouses and factories but made no effort to penetrate any of the " presidential-residential sites " or the many other facilities where they had been denied entry in the past . The debate has homed in on Saddam 's " palaces " ; there are dozens of them  --  some vast compounds , according to Bill Clinton , as big as the District of Columbia  --  and the Iraqis sometimes pin that label on any facility they want to keep closed . In fact , many other areas , including the bases and barracks of the intelligence services and the Republican Guard , are suspected of harboring materials that Iraq promised to give up under the truce agreement of 1991. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
