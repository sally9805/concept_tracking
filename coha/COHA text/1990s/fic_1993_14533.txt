Part of a barbed wire fence to suggest a " border " is visible . Three men enter the stage one at a time . Each one is carrying a heavy-duty spotlight . One of them carries a small CB . Another carries a concealed weapon . With a look of mutual consent they take up their positions . They 're now going to " play " the War Boys game . They play this game for real . The three of them crouch on a raised area , the " car area , " of the stage in silence , scanning the border , until David points at something he " sees " moving out there . DAVID Put the brights on . Now ! Now ! ( They turn their spotlights on their " public . " ) GEORGE Fuckin ' beaner . Look at him run ! DAVID Sweet Christ , he 's wearing my Adidas .

GREG By the way , David , it 's a known fact that rich boys beat off three point seven times more than poor boys . Know why ? ( Holds up his hands to David 's face ) p. 4 GEORGE I can hold a cigarette with my dick . GREG Because guys like me have n't got , excuse me , I mean " ai n't got , " all that free , leisure , wack-wack time . GEORGE Can we make it an early night tonight ? Little bro is sick again .

( David snorts , then throws himself to the ground and begins to belly-crawl about the stage , searching for something across the border . George and Greg ignore him . ) GEORGE It 's your go . GREG I 'm not in the mood . GEORGE It 's your go . GREG No thanks . GEORGE Come on . You promised . You played it with David last time . ( George rolls up his sleeve and after some moments , Greg does so wearily . Then Greg slaps George , though not hard , across the face . As they converse , George returns the slap , somewhat harder . Each slaps the other harder until one of them loses their balance . Meanwhile , David is still crawling about sniffing. ) p. 5 GREG So who 's our contact tonight ? ( Slaps George ) GEORGE Officer Sharons . GREG Shit . Sharons is a drunk-ass . Always too slow on the call-up . GEORGE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're getting through somewhere from three through seven . GREG ( Slaps George ) : There 's always a hole .

Greg slaps him hard . ) GREG Food . In the corner of your mouth . Hear that ? Listen . GEORGE What ? GREG Listen . GEORGE I do n't hear anything . ( Beat ) For a mop-boy you sure are stupid . ( George slaps Greg hard . He is knocked off his seat . ) It never lasts more than ten hits with you . You 're a wimp. p. 6 DAVID ( Still crawling about ) : Psst . Here sissy , sissy , sissy .

( David circles back to their area , grabs Greg 's leg and clings to him , exaggerating . ) DAVID Oh , Father , who art in heaven , help me to step down from this stifling perch . Help me to respect manual labor , so I can wear filthy overalls , so I can make money with my own bare hands and get out of those oppressive neighborhood recycling programs . GEORGE Let 's move . GREG We 've got to wait till ten . ( Shakes David off ) Sorry , Buddy . Once an MC-er , always an MC-er. p. 7 GEORGE What 's an MC-er ? DAVID Moose-Cuticle , you idiot . GREG Short for Middle Class .

DAVID ( Still to Greg ) : Five bucks you ca n't . ( Greg ignores him . ) GEORGE ( Moves a good distance from them ) : I 'll do it over here . DAVID ( To George ) : Nope , I 'll need to see the evidence . GREG You two are kindergarten . GEORGE ( Moves closer ) : OK , but no peeking. p. 8 DAVID On your marks .

GEORGE Yeah , well , I almost had you , bud . But when you got to the " and to the Republic " bit that brought me down . DAVID Your credit with me is going to drop , sir , if you ca n't improve your performance . GREG You two . Shit . ( Beat ) Listen , we stay in the car tonight or I 'm quits with you guys .

Standing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickling your palate . GREG ( Interrupts ) : I was fucked-up that night . I 'm not like you dogs .

DAVID ( Pushing Greg with his finger ) : Since when do you call the shots for this brigade ? Hey ? Who gives you a ride here in the evenings ? GREG You do . DAVID Who pays for the gas ? GREG You do . DAVID Who buys you your six-pack ? GREG I just do n't want things to get messy tonight . GEORGE Do n't spoil the evening , Greg . DAVID Hey . I never swore I was n't a sick individual now did I ? GEORGE We 'll be good . My bro 's sick . I want to be home early . ( Gets on his knees and shouts toward the border , which is now the public ) Mama Mia . Come on , come on ! Let 's light this birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up . ( Kneels next to George , extends his arms to the public ) See the greatest show on earth . ( Greg now joins in . The tune for this song should give the sense of a chain-gang-type ballad . All three sing the " Border Song . " ) ALL On the border , we can see the pretty sights , some in the day , but the best ones at night.Bring a six-pack of Bud and a bag of chips , bring some soda pop and some tamale dip . We can spot them running , we can watch them crawl , we can tie them up , we can have a ball.We can make ten dollars if we catch one alive , the feds will pay us money and they 'll give us no jive . ( David jumps up , toppling Greg . ) DAVID Shhhh . Did you hear that ? GEORGE What ? GREG Where ? DAVID Shhhhh . ( David sings again , but alone , as others tap out music . ) Barbaric ? A clear case of missing morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the highest authority.These beaners do n't value life as we boys do , we heard it from the top , they want to mix a racial stew . p. 11 GREG ( Sings ) : Now we got dead-end jobs or the army option , we can travel to kill or we can sell the MacLuncheon . GEORGE ( Sings ) : But why take orders or clean up someone 's shit , when we can light up the border , ten dollars a hit . DAVID You know what I heard today ? They say some of our own kind have crossed over there . ( All three are on guard and nervous . ) GEORGE Over there ? DAVID Forming a so-called " protect the Mex " band . ( Beat ) Could be they 're carrying knives . GREG I do n't think so . DAVID Could be they 're carrying guns . GEORGE Guns ? GREG Do n't listen to him , George . DAVID Scared , Greg ?

GREG ( Whispers ) : Just some stones rolling down the hill , George . DAVID ( Sees something ) : What 's that ? GEORGE Where ? GREG Where ? DAVID Something shining . Two . Three things shining . GEORGE ( Whispers ) : Let 's go . GREG I do n't see anything shining . DAVID ( Whispers ) : Blades . Knife blades . ( Shouts ) Blades ! ( Throws a knife in front of them ) ( Greg and George both scare and duck . David laughs at them . ) GEORGE That 's not very funny , David . p. 13 DAVID With you two I ca n't resist . GREG ( Clutching his stomach ) : Hold it . DAVID Must you repeat this performance every time there 's a little excitement down here ? I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstage and begins to vomit . ) Could n't you get some pills to keep it down ? You 're pitiful , sweetheart . GEORGE ( Hands over ears ) : That noise gets to me . DAVID Five bucks says I can make it worse for you , Greg . ( Greg is oblivious to them ; he 's still sick . George stands over him with his arm raised like the Statue of Liberty . David sings : ) America , AmericaGod shed his grace on theeAnd crown thy goodWith brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea . ( As David sings , Greg recovers . Lights change slightly as he moves downstage right , near their public , wiping his mouth on his sleeve . ) You , my man , do n't have the belly to take a joke . GEORGE Take it easy , Greg . He did n't see anything . GREG Yeah ? Well , maybe I did . ( During Greg 's monologue , George and David carry on in and around the car area . They are not unaware of Greg 's performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , however , they intervene . Greg addresses the border . ) ( To border ) Hey ! Hey ! Dame dos cuchillos . Throw me a couple of knives . ( Turns back to his friends a moment ) Think I have n't got it in me ? Maybe I 'll just step over there and find out if they 're carrying knives . ( Spits on his palms , smooths back his hair , addresses border again ) Think I have n't got it in me ? Scared , are you ? ( Beat ) Hey . I bet you never belonged to the Boy Scouts . I did . The church choir ? ( Holds a note ) I could hold the longest note . Then I went on to join the Sunday Dixie Band . And then the Blueshell Campaign to save the farmers . Then I joined the Border Brigade . ( Lifts his shirt and draws an imaginary line down the center of his body ) This half of me is Mejicano . This other half of me is WASP . Como sabes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to tell me : " Este lado es Mejicano . This side is Mexican  --  ( Slaps left breast ) the side with the heart . " p. 14 GEORGE ( Spots something ) : Look . DAVID Another one ! GEORGE A beaner chick . In heat . GREG My father me dijo it was my lower half that was WASP , that I had his cojones  --  ( Grobs crotch ) but the brains of a beaner . ( Beat ) When I was a little nio I was two separate pieces , just below the surface , held together by skin . DAVID Here she comes . GEORGE Throw the brights on her . DAVID Not yet , not yet . Wait . GREG Did n't do sports . Did n't run during recess . Never got on a bike . Nada ni mierda . If I 'd made the wrong move I 'd split , right down the center . DAVID You 're missing the spectacle , Greggie . GEORGE Open the sun roof . Hey , baby . Slip under the wire . DAVID We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Border Brigade . GREG Mi padre , he was a Senior Agente of the Border . He used to take a lot of slack for having married a Wet . But he always said it was strategy , that he knew them better , inside and out , on account of her . p. 15 DAVID Come and get your red-hot , one-hundred-percent American hard-on . GEORGE ( Sings ) : It 's the real thing GREG They say he was a good cop . DAVID ( Sings ) : That 's the way it should be GREG He made OK dinero , helped me get a loan so I could buy my first car . Then I met my first girl . She was Chicana . ( Beat ) I figured , like father like son . And this chica was legal , nice trailer , two-parent family . She was n't real pretty , but she gave me a feeling ( Beat ) like eatin ' a bowl of frosted flakes with tequila . We were planning on living together , so I brought her home to meet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck . DAVID Her shirt 's tangled up in the wire . GREG He called us into his office . I told him I was thinking about marrying her . He took a hold of Evalina 's long braid and tipped her head back . ( Beat ) Then he stuck his fingers in her mouth and tested her molars . He found the hole where she 'd just had a tooth pulled . He jammed his nail in it , and she yelled . Then he just shook his head . He was disappointed . p. 16 GEORGE She ca n't get loose . GREG Then he took out his wallet . " You ca n't marry a woman with a bad set of teeth , " he said . " It spoils the breath . " He counted it out : veinte , quarenta , sesenta , cien . Two hundred bucks . DAVID Come on , Godiva . A few more shakes , and I 'll let you polish the hood of my new Mustang . GREG My Evalina was wearing an orange blouse that day , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't even look Mexican . GEORGE Maybe she 's Arab . GREG He unbuttoned her blouse and tucked the money in her bra . ( Beat ) Then he kissed us both on the forehead . DAVID ( Shoving him ) : Go on , George . Talk to her . GEORGE But I ca n't speak Spanish . DAVID Shit Spanish . She 's a bitch . Give her poetry . GREG Over breakfast the next morning he asked me if I 'd made the appointment with the dentist . GEORGE Chica , chica . GREG I said yes . I told him me and Evalina , we both appreciated his advice . p. 17 DAVID Not that . Marvell , stupid . Watch this : " When as in silks my beaner goes , then , then , methinks how sweedy flows the greasafaction of her clothes . Next when I cast mine " GEORGE It worked . She 's grinnin ' like a raccoon . Hey , hamburguesa ! GREG I suppose Evalina went and got her teeth fixed . I do n't know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over ninety billion served . GREG I mean , mi padre , he was a strict man sometimes , but he looked out for me . GEORGE Move over Let me out of the car . GREG ( To George and David , who have begun to encroach too far on his story ) : Stay in the fuckin ' car , George . GEORGE The lady needs to be rescued . ( To David ) Just watch this . You watching ? GREG Asshole . We 've got a deal with the feds . We spot them . That 's all . If we fuck up again GEORGE Fuck you , Greg . Hey , muchacha ! ! DAVID Look at old Georgie . He 's combing back his hair . GREG You two baboon asses are fuckin ' up my thing . ( Pushes George back ) Ca n't you shut up just a few more seconds until I 'm done ? ( George and David mock-freeze . For some seconds Greg does n't know where to pick up again . ) I suppose Evalina got her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me after that p. 18 DAVID ( Interrupts ) : No , no . You left off at ( Mocks Greg 's voice ) , " He was a strict man , but he looked out for me . " GREG Yeah . Thanks . ( Beat ) But he looked out for me . It was about a year later , and I came home to visit my mother . I told her about me and Evalina being over , about how Father had offered to pay to fix her teeth . I watched her pour a whole bottle of detergent into the washer . Then she said , like she might have been saying " hand me a towel , " " And you let him do that ? " ( Beat ) Then she smacked me across the face . Not hard . But it was the first time she ever hit me . Then she just kept saying it , over and over : " Y to dejaste hocerlo ? " And you let him do that ? DAVID ( Louder ) : And you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you let him do that ? GREG I almost said , " She was just a fuckin ' beaner , Ma . " ( Begins to laugh ) Would n't have been the appropriate thing to say . When my father walked through the door that night , " bang , " she hit him over the head with a dinner plate . ( Raises arms slowly as though holding a gun and fires ) Bang bang bang A few years later , my father se murio . Dead . I dragged around the half of me que fue muerte , his dead half . Sometimes I 'd wake up in the middle of the night and I 'd smell its deadness , like rotten cantaloupe . ( Beat ) So that 's why I joined up . Because , even though my mother died shortly after , the beaner half of me would n't die . p. 19 DAVID Hold it ! ( He hurries over and lifts up Greg 's foot . ) Look at this . You 're standing on a sapling . How many times do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're standing . Lucky you did n't break the poor little fellow 's back . Go stand somewhere else . ( Greg moves a few feet away . ) GREG Here ? ( David motions with his hand for Greg to move a little farther . ) Here ? ( David nods OK and returns to the car area . Greg continues . ) As a matter of fact , the beaner half of me began to move in on the other half . In no time at all I was seventy-percent beaner , and it keeps spreading . Before I know it , uno , dos , tres , I 'll be a hundred-percent pure beef wetback . I 'm feeling it in my bones . And my feet , they want to dance that cockroach song . ( Does a mild tap dance of sorts ) But every time we catch one of those Mejicanos crossing the border , the pressure eases up . Y puedo descansar . DAVID Look , George . She 's still there . Waiting . GEORGE ( Approaching public as though it were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite of my apple ? GREG ( Continues ) : The creeping flow of her blood in me backs up a bit , and I can rest for a while  --  p. 20 DAVID That a boy , Georgie . Show her your intellect . GREG  --  and stop fighting it . ( Beat ) So I hunt . It 's harmless , really . ( Strums barbed wire and sings , to the tune of " Oh , Susannah " : ) Oh , Evalina , no llores mas par mi ( Greg stops , then starts again in English . ) Oh Evalina , do n't you cry for me for I 'm going on down to the borderwith a six-pack ' cross my knee . ( Greg laughs self-consciously , then speaks nervously to David as he nears the car area . ) Make him get back in the car . She could pull a knife on him . ( To public again ) I try not to hurt them , though , especially the women . DAVID It 's just like watching your VHS . GREG It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was one of them . ( To his friends ) Shit , come on , you guys . This is n't part of the deal . Ca n't you wait until I 'm done ? ( George gazes across the public then begins to crawl closer as he " sees " the woman nearing the border . ) DAVID What 's the matter , Greggie ? Not getting the attention you need ? p. 21 GREG ( Tries to get back to his story ) : Especialmente las mujeres , the women . Just want to espantarlos un poco , scare them up a bit , let them know they do n't belong here . And we get ten bucks for each one we catch . In a good week I can make seventy , eighty bucks . Helps on the bills . DAVID Get lucky , baby . Heads or tails . GREG But , hey , let 's lighten up now . Vengan . Vengan . Loosen up . We 'll pick up a bottle of rotgut tequila , cruise on down to Dairy Mart road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , catch us some fish , some peces for supper , huh ? ( Huge groan from David . Greg is disconcerted a moment . ) ( To David ) Fuck off . ( Beat ) I mean , we 're all a mix , are n't we ? ( Whispers ) But which half has got the heart , huh ? Huh ? DAVID Hey , Greg , how do you spell relief ? GREG ( Oblivious to David 's interference ) : Come on . You can get some relief . Take your mind off of a long day 's work . DAVID Well ? GREG ( To public ) : So how do you spell relief ? ( George begins to caress the stage floor as he stares out at the woman . He does this sensually , carefully. ) p. 22 DAVID ( To George ) : I spell it B-E-A-N-E-R-S . GREG Beaners . ( Greg jumps into the car . ) DAVID George will teach her the lesson she needs . She 'll run back home now , tell her compadres : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned by fire " ( To George ) What 's the rest of the pledge , George ? I 'll knock ten dollars off your tab if you can remember it . GEORGE ( Remembering ) : It goes It goes " can be burned by fire and the the white man will rub two Mexicans together to make his fire . " GREG ( Interrupts ) : That 's it . I 'm walking . Get out of my fuckin ' way . DAVID ( Grabs Greg by collar ) : But old Ronald McDonald is going to score ninety billion and one tonight . GREG I 'm calling Sharons . DAVID Can you smell the meat cooking , Greggie ? Or are you going to spoil your appetite again ? ( Beat ) Hey , give me that radio , you  --  GREG Calling for Officer Sharons . Calling for Officer  --  p. 23 DAVID You idiot ! GREG Emergency . A dozen beaners just broke the line at fence number  --  ( David hits Greg across the face with his gun . ) Fuck ! You busted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREG I do n't want things getting out of hand . DAVID You did n't mind things getting out of hand the other night , though , did you ? GREG That was different . This one 's a kid . DAVID Sure , sure . Old Greggie coaching on the sidelines . Grunt , grunt , grunt . GREG ( Motioning to gun ) : OK . But you said you 'd leave that at home tonight . Give it to me . DAVID ( Calmly ) : But it 's my toy , Greg . And this is my car . As a matter of fact , this is my brigade . I got us the deal with the feds , did n't I ? Ten dollars a tag , remember ? GREG Get back in the fuckin ' car , George . DAVID You 're not very appreciative , Greg . I do n't like that in a man . GREG George ! DAVID This is disappointing me , Greg . p. 24 GREG We made a deal with the feds we would n't touch them anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything 's cool . Do n't get upset , Greg . ( Turns ) Look , she 's fine . There she goes . I did n't touch her . DAVID Runnin ' on back to Disneyland . GEORGE See ? We can keep things in hand . It 's cool . GREG Let 's get out of here . This night is cracked . GEORGE Sure . Anything you say , Greg . We 're all friends here , right ? GREG Look . I want to have a good time too . Why do you two always have to fuck up my show ? DAVID We 'll be good little gentlemen from now on . Trust us , Greg . GEORGE Yeah . Trust us . DAVID ( Sneering ) : And I apologize for slapping you . Really . ( Suddenly , David throws himself on George 's shoulder and pretends to weep . Greg and George watch with concern . George is fooled ; Greg is not . ) GEORGE He 's choked up . DAVID ( Through his gasping ) : " This side is Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greg . p. 25 GREG Not bad , eh ? DAVID There were times I thought I heard angels singing between the lines . ( Beat ) I mean , you 're OK , Greg . ( Beat ) So , if it came down to it , down to the nitty-gritty , which would you choose , Birdseye 's or Stouffer 's ? GREG I 'm a canned foods man myself . GEORGE What 's with the canned foods ? GREG Shut up , George . GEORGE No . DAVID ( To George ) : Take his advice , son , or you 'll get your feelings hurt . ( To Greg ) Well ? GREG Well ? GEORGE Hey , I can make a balloon with my spit . ( He blows spit bubbles ) DAVID Did they go for it ? GREG I 'm not sure . DAVID You 're not sure ? Every soldier must be sure . GREG That 's right . No uncertainty . No doubts . GEORGE Come on ; Greg . Is that true , the bit about your dad and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part about him unbuttoning her shirt . p. 26 DAVID So you fabricated ? GREG Only in a minor way . GEORGE And your dad , beaned to death with a dinner plate ? GREG Nope . Cholesterol got him . DAVID He should have borrowed my rowing machine . ( Beat ) Shhh . Hear that , George ? ( George shakes his head no while he listens . ) Sounded like a howl . GREG No , David . You 're a howl . DAVID That 's the border wolf . It howls like that just before it kills . GEORGE I did n't hear a howl . GREG ( Joining in to get George ) : I did . It sounded like this . ( Springs up on car and howls . This should be more frightening than funny ) Well , how did I do ? DAVID One minor criticism : your prose is a tad flat , somewhat backwards , too working class . You 've got to flex it up a bit . GREG You think so ? GEORGE Can we quit early tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry about Evalina. p. 27 GREG Thanks . DAVID She was always nice to me when I came by your place for dinner . Once , she wiped the corners of my mouth with her apron . I think she appreciated my appetite . I always had a third helping . GREG You never met Evalina . DAVID You see how you restrict your imagination ? GEORGE He 's probably waiting up for me . GREG My imagination ? GEORGE It 's a nice thing to have someone waiting up for you . GREG ( Poking David with his finger ) : All you 're good at is giving points , Mr. Critic . Why do n't you go stand out over there and see how many knives you can catch with your teeth . I caught three myself . DAVID Tsk , tsk . Do I detect a challenge ? How infantile . But all right . ( Takes a dramatic breath , steps away from the car and faces the public ) All right . ( Calls ) Hello ? Anyone at home ? I know you 're out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee blue-bloods who belong on this side , not that one Look , I am going to give you a target , right inside here . ( Opens his mouth wide and hisses for some moments ) Throw them right in here . Right in the bull's-eye . Or how about this ? ( Turns his back to the public , spreads his arms and legs ) Aim for the spine . Go ahead . Give me a tickle . ( Beat ) They 're not interested in me , Greg . It 's you they 're lusting for . See ? They wo n't tickle with me . ( Beat ) All right then . ( Spins around ) Then I 'll tickle with you . ( Beat ) Want to see me do an imitation of a baby radish with its roots growing ? p. 28 GREG A radish is a root . DAVID But the root has got roots as well and they crawl deep in the dark , like this . ( David squirms about . He is serious about doing a good imitation . He begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or around the car area . ) Listen ! Listen ! You can hear them growing radish roots . They make a sound when they grow  --  ( Makes a sound ) radiating out minute bits of heat into the wet dirt , making the wet dirt hiss . ( Makes hissing noises ) Hot in the mouth ! The tongue burning . My sister and I. We 'd fill up our mouths , see who could chew up the most before we spit them out like confetti , all over our shoes . ( Beat ) When my mother tried to leave , I said to her : " Mother , you 're an insect , and , like the child you brought me up to be , I 'll pluck out your wings . " ( Beat ) After Sis passed away , I could n't apologize about the radishes . I had wanted to send Sis a nice card , some chocolates , maybe a balloon . She was an intelligent girl . When she left home , she said to me : " I 'm root-bound here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Laughs nervously ) Telephone pole cracked her pot , too , you could say . ( Pretends to write a letter in the air ) p. 29 GREG ( " Sees " a child in the distance ) : Check this out : a toddler . GEORGE ( Yells ) : Hey , kiddo , ( Whistles ) want to play Master of the Universe ? DAVID Dear Sis : Sorry about the radishes . Love , Bro . ( Takes off his shoe , polishes it on his thigh , and places it down carefully ) GREG Nope . Headin ' his fanny back to them hills . GEORGE ( Motioning toward David ) : He 's strippin ' again . GREG This is getting to be a yawn , David . DAVID ( Ignoring them ) : Now , my mother was what you might call a call a ( Snaps his fingers until his friends give him his line ) GREG a dignified type .

She gave me a look then , the way a hole looks back at you if you 're looking down in it . And then I knew she knew about Sis . ( Takes off other shoe , polishes it , and lines it up carefully next to the other one ) My daddy had a saying : Never Never ( He ca n't remember his lines ) Fuck ! p. 30 GREG Never shut your eyes . DAVID Never shut your eyes to a woman because if you do , before you know it , she 'll stick you full like a pin cushion , sew your scrotum to your ass , use you for a foot stool . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe ) Radishes . A shame they ever existed . ( Beat ) I could have plucked out their wings like insects . But they would n't . Stand still . They squirm . They wiggle . They wreak havoc in your garden . ( Removes other sock . Notices bare feet and wiggles them in fascination ) Hey . You got to keep fit . If the body is a drag ( Snaps fingers . No response . Snaps them again ) GREG Learn the shit , will you , David . DAVID Show some consideration , please ? GREG ( Wearily ) : If the body is a drag , the spirit 's gon na  --  ( Sticks his finger in his mouth and gags ) DAVID  --  the spirit will gag . ( Sits down and begins to row ) Row , row , row your boat gently down the stream , merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily life is but a ( He draws out last note . ) Radish ! ( David quits rowing . Gets up and unbuttons his shirt. ) p. 31 GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're paying for this peep show ? DAVID I mean , when you grow up you 've got choices to make in life . So you choose : Johnny Carson or Hee-Haw , Seven-Up or Sprite , CBS or NBC , Beechnut or Juicy Fruit , Trident or Dentine . ( Beat ) I had a fiance once . But every time I desired her and leaned to deliver the first real kiss of my life , this music began in my ear . ( Sings : ) Wrigley Spearmint gum , gum , gum , Wrigley Spearmint gum , gum , gum ( As he repeats these lines , Greg and George sing the accompaniment to the song " Carry it with you that great fresh flavor " until David silences them with his arms , as a conductor of an orchestra would . ) Excuse me , gentlemen , but I like to do it solo . ( Beat ) Somehow the melody put me off kissing her . Or I 'd reach in her shirt to fondle her breast and whisper bits of sassafras into her ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gettin ' that barefoot feelin ' , drinkin ' Mountain Dew ( David laughs wildly as though tickled . Then speaks seriously . ) When things get hot , cool is all you got . ( Beat ) I could n't get that music out of my brain . ( Beat ) I work for a law firm . ( Lays his shirt out on floor and kneels to button it up again ) My partner says he likes girls in their adolescence . My father liked them young , too , but he swore sheep had die greater dignity . He brought a girl home for me once when I made an A in Mathematics . And the three of us got drunk . ( Laughs ) All I remember are three white hooves and one black one . ( Stands and sings in opera style ) Baa-baa black sheep , can I tickle your wool ? I 've only been arrested once . After Sis 's funeral . I went out hacking up neighbors ' gardens , hunting for radishes . This officer picked me up , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd passed out . She was fighting like a whirl-wind , so he put a gag on her in the cell adjacent to mine and pulled off her trousers . I could see the girl 's face . She was trying to scream , but the gag would n't let her . The officer was so busy with her he did n't see me reach my arm through the bars and touch her face . She had hair that curled like Sis 's . Come on , I whispered to her , scream , scream , damn you . And her whole face was screaming , only no sound was coming out , and I felt like someone pulled my plug , because I started to scream instead : ( Whispers ) No ! No ! and I kept on screaming until the officer put out my lights . p. 32 GREG There ! George ! There 's two of them ! GEORGE Where ? I ca n't see anything . GREG Right there ! Look Nope . Lost them . Damn . DAVID Then I dreamt about Sis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , fishing for radishes in the garden . Like a pearl in an oyster , she 'd say , when she pulled one up out of the dirt . ( Beat ) She was my my ( Snaps fingers . No response ) Hey ! GEORGE AND GREG Fuck you ! DAVID She was my friend . ( David takes off his britches , lays them out . He stands in his underwear . The shape of a person is now laid out on the floor . ) GREG Not the all-cotton Armani trousers . DAVID ( Playfully ) : Now , which one is me ? This one ? ( To self ) or that one ? ( To suit on floor ) Or is that old Sis lying there ? ( Beat ) Sis and I were from an aspiring middle-class neighborhood . Even as kids we were smart enough to keep our eyes on the next rung of the ladder . ( While David tells the following , George crawls into David 's space , climbs onto the clothes and does push-ups over them . ) Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks so we could mingle with the best . I mean , in our town we were the " betters , " but we aspired to be the best . Well , some of the kids we met there started calling me a pussy for hanging out with my sister . I was twelve and she was ten . They said I could join their club but that I 'd have to choose , them or her . Of course I said I 'd choose them , because I knew I could make it up to Sis later when we got home . ( Now George flips over on his back and is motionless . David stands over him . ) But then they gave me a dare in order to join . And they held her down . ( David kneels over George 's body . George is lifeless . ) They pulled up her skirt . They dared me . If you say no to a dare , you 're a pussy . I could not be a pussy . But everything was getting sort of out of focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had three of them , big as chestnuts that she and I dug that morning . I put them inside her . ( David kicks George hard in the side ; he does this with no apparent emotion . ) I put them inside her . She just kept whispering my name . She would n't scream . Just saying : ( Whispers ) " David , no . David , no . David , no . David , no . " ( George moves out of David 's " show . " ) She never looked me in the face again , for eleven years , until her Toyota hit that telephone post . Then she had to look at me . Lying in that coffin , she had no choice but to look up at me . ( Speaks to clothes on floor ) " I 'm sorry , Sis , " I said . ( Speaks each word in isolation ) I am sorry . ( After a moment , David spits on the face of the clothes figure . This action is almost tender . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wings . ( Beat ) I 'm not pulling your leg like Greg was . See , when you break a human being in half , right over your knee , crack , like a sack , there is no fixing him . Like there was no fixing her , my little sis . ( David covers his face with hands as in a moment of agony , but then he starts laughing . Greg walks into David 's space. ) p. 33 GREG Come on , come on . Rapido , rapido . " Bingo , " goes la cabeza : David , you knock off wets for a kick , because you feel guilty about the let 's call it the vegetable rape of your pobre hermana . Go ahead , put yourself in the frame . Frame the pig . DAVID It was misplaced anger , transfer of violence , all due to a dysfunctional home . GREG It feels better , does n't it , once you get a handle on the problema ? DAVID I appreciate the kindness , Greg , but get the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ) : You 're not living up to your degree , David . DAVID Certainly I am ( Beat ) regretful about Sis . ( Makes popping sounds ) Fried my soul . But it is n't her at all . I 'm tired of my job at the law firm . I 'm bored . ( Beat ) There are just too many decisions to make : mustard vinaigrette or the house special ? BMW or Volvo ? Paper or plastic ? ( David suddenly gags and begins to choke . Greg watches with disdain ; George is fooled . He cautiously approaches David while glancing with fear at the border . ) GEORGE ( Whispers ) : David ? ( David continues to gag . ) David ? Are you OK ? ( To Greg ) Something 's the matter with him , Greg . Come and look . ( George touches David with his foot . David does n't move . Then , suddenly , he grabs George 's leg and bites it . George screams and shakes him loose . Greg and David laugh together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . Did I fall on my sapling ? GREG I hope so . GEORGE That was n't funny . I 'm going home . Even if I have to walk . ( David gets up and approaches George . David spits on his hands and smooths George 's hair back in place . This is a tender action . Then he suddenly strikes him . ) Hey ! DAVID Remember our agreement ? The three of us stick together . Right , George ? Right ? ( George does n't answer . ) GREG Lay off him . DAVID What ? GREG I said lay off him . DAVID What did Greg say ? GREG Greg said : " Fuck you . " ( David takes a moment to register this , then sings at Greg . ) DAVID On the border , Greg 's getting nauseous.On the border , he 's just too serious . GREG ( Pushing David backward with the lines that he sings ) : On the border , you 're playing frat-boy-king.On the border , your education 's nothing . DAVID ( Pushing Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border , it 's your American half-dream , one side upriver , the other downstream . p. 35 GREG ( Winning ) : On the border , too many tricks in your head.On the border , you just might wind up dead . ( There is a silence for some moments as Greg and David stare at one another . Then George begins applauding and continues until he gets their attention . David grins and casually picks up his clothes off the floor and slings them over his shoulder . He crosses to the car ; Greg follows him . ) GEORGE What a show ! DAVID You liked that , did n't you ? GREG I 'd never have guessed . GEORGE You are a poet . DAVID Ah , but a poet born from grief . And everyone believes a poet , especially a poet who GEORGE I had to memorize a poem once for class . DAVID indulges a little , elaborates a bit for the show . GEORGE Want to hear me recite it ? GREG So the radishes were only an elaboration ? DAVID Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idiot who sawed off his arm . p. 36 GREG So you lied . DAVID The radish episode is true . GEORGE I just got to say that that was a pretty disgusting thing to do to your sister , David . ( David shrugs . ) GREG I 'm sorry about your sister . She always had a nice word for me . DAVID ( Casually ) : You never met her . ( Greg shrugs . ) GEORGE Do you think they 're sorry ? ( Motions to border ) DAVID ( Whispers ) : Frankly , dear , I do n't give a damn . GREG So what did you choose in the end ? DAVID Why , I choose Marlboro , of course . ( David and Greg laugh together , as though at an inside joke . ) GEORGE ( Angered ) : You two are so cool , are n't you ? Big jokers with broken hearts . DAVID ( Looking at his watch ) : It 's time to move fence lines . GREG Yep . Los peces are n't biting here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . DAVID You 've got asparagus for brains , Georgie . I said let 's go . GEORGE You just watch . Old George will surprise you . ( Moves across stage , whistling and glancing shyly at the border/public ) DAVID ( Claps softly ) : That was wonderful , George , now zip your fly and let 's go . GEORGE ( Confiding ) : But it 's different for me , ' cause mine is a secret . DAVID George . Old buddy . You 're just blocking the view . GREG Shhh . George has a secret . Must n't tell . Must n't tell . DAVID All right . But there 's nothing that long-toothed border wolf hates more than a pitiful performance . ( Greg and David howl . ) GEORGE Just ignore them . ( Beat ) Lookie what I can do ? ( Grabs barbed wire and twists it . Holds his hands up ) See ? ( Beat ) You got to forgive them . They want to be honest . They 're OK guys . I grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you step on that sapling Move it . To the right . ( George does so . ) Farther . Farther . p. 38 GREG Farther . GEORGE ( Moves closer to public ) : Is this OK ? ( Beat ) I do n't want them to hear some of this , so I got to speak soft . I was a kid when it started growing . It was the size of a penny , right in the middle of my back . It just popped up one day when I was standing in front of this billboard waiting for the school bus . On the billboard was a picture of a camel , sitting on a beach with sunglasses , smoking a cigarette . The camel had this smile on his face I 'd never seen on any human face before : this smile of slap-happiness , of some just-do-it secret . And that 's when I felt it pop up on my back : the hump . The camel 's hump . ( Does a curious rotating motion with his shoulders ) Most kids would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just kept it hid under my jacket so as not to scare my friends . ( Beat ) By the time I was a grown man I had a genuine camel 's hump on my back . GREG His fuckin ' hump again . GEORGE When it quit growing I started waiting in front of the mirror for the rest of it , for the smile . I was patient , too . But it did n't come . I started smokin ' two at a time , to hurry it up a bit but the smile still held out on me . So there I was , a camel 's hump without a smile , like a dick without balls . ( Itches his back ) Do n't believe me ? ( Turns around and lifts his shirt . We see nothing ) Then what the hell is that ? A pimple the size of a pup ? p. 39 DAVID It 's an infected pore . GREG Another stripper . Yawn . DAVID Hey ! Look out . I saw something move over there . GEORGE ( Pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my hump . ( Beat ) Now my daddy , he had  --  DAVID Not another father story . GEORGE  --  no hump , no smile and , after the mines , only one lung to smoke with . But he was a G-O-O-D man . ( Beat ) I was into four-legged animals back then , so he took me hunting . I was seven . We sat on the tail of the truck , oiling the rifles . It was so cold I could n't feel my hands in my gloves . I walked behind him . I must have stepped on every damn twig in the woods . He kept smacking the cap off my head  --  ( Smacks self in head a few times ) telling me to shush up . Finally , we saw one . A buck . He was the size of a horse with antlers like Christmas trees . ( Dramatically ) His breath circled up out of his nose like ropes . ( Snickers at friends in car area ) Not bad , huh ? DAVID George , I sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythm , we might have to cancel . How about a questionnaire to liven things up ? Let 's see a show of hands . How many of you have enjoyed  --  p. 40 GEORGE Shut up . DAVID ( Continues ) :  --  a Big Mac so conscientiously that you had to hurry off to the restroom after the meal to beat off ? ( Not to be discouraged , George returns to his monologue . ) GEORGE My daddy whispered : ( Shouts ) " If you make a noise , I 'll kill you . " The barrel rose over my No How about this : the cold , black barrel rose over my daddy 's shoulder  --  DAVID ( As though counting hands ) : Which of you had the guts to switch from Coke to Pepsi out of respect for Schwarzkopf ? ( George now raises the invisible rifle and aims it at his friends . ) GEORGE  --  and he took aim . The buck raised its head . Its long tongue licked its gray nose . And then I saw it . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time in my life , that smile , that smirk of oblivion and party time . And then it hit me : that was my camel . Not a buck but my camel . ( Lets out a wild yodel ) That 's just what I did . Then that camel burned rubber . The shot rang out . My father spun , and out went my lights . GREG This one 's especially for you , David : do you recycle ? ( Beat ) Only your milk jugs ? Tsk , tsk. p. 41 DAVID ( To Greg ) : You do n't respect your environment . GEORGE When I woke I saw leaves above me , then my daddy 's face , the spit dripping down his chin , right into my eye . He made me crawl back to the truck on my hands and knees , with the barrel of his gun at my ass . But I did n't mind a bit . I was happy . My camel had got away . And I 'd been born again by that smile . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camel ) DAVID Hey , Greg , were you SDSS ? ( Whispers ) Rat-tat-tat-tat . I was . GREG ( Whispers ) . Secret Desert Storm Supporter ? You know , David , that 's what I 've always appreciated about you liberal types . I mean , recycling not only your clear glass but your green glass as well . GEORGE Beautiful , huh ? That stride . The stride of a camel . There is nothing else like it . DAVID Hey , I care , while you , you 've made no choices for the future . GEORGE I paste billboards now , and take care of my little bro . But do n't think I 'm one of those broken-hearted give-ups . I 'm watching out for that smile again . You see , unless you are a certain kind of American you miss the smile , and all those people out there , sneaking their way in here , are out to steal that smile . But over my dead body . That 's what I say : over my dead body . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat ) Want another peek at my hump ? ( Begins to lift shirt teasingly ) Fuck off . Go get your own . ( Beat ) I 'm a camel . ( Chews again ) ( David moves in on George 's space . He pushes George onto all fours and puts his foot on George 's back . George does n't resist. ) p. 42 DAVID You , sir , are obviously malfunctioning . Your father shoved a gun barrel up your rectum , so you are also anal retentive . GEORGE Anal what ? DAVID And if a gentleman such as this is anal , it only follows that he 'll work the border . GEORGE Oink , oink . DAVID I never saw a yellow ribbon tied around your tree , George . And I know for a fact that you do n't save your newspapers . Did you know that it takes ten years for a seed to become a sapling ? GEORGE ( Shouts ) : This is my story . Mine . Get the fuck out ! GREG ( To David ) : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How come you always get to interrupt ? Whenever you want ? DAVID Because you let me ? GEORGE ( Struggles to his feet ) : Fuckin ' traitors . Both of you . You 're no better than a pair of beaners . Fuckin ' beaners , both of you . ( Beat . ) DAVID George , Greg . This is why I must constantly interrupt you . It 's my duty . You see , people like me , we do n't call them beaners , wetbacks or greasers . We who are n't of your , shall we say " constipated class , " we call them illegal aliens , immigration offenders or , for those of us , like myself , still religiously inclined , " poor souls . " Try and show a little understanding . I mean , I 've used my education to figure it out : we stagnate their economies with our IMFs and can't-pay-them-off-ever loans , so they 've got to try and cross and work for Roto-Rooter . Why ca n't you two be a little more sympathetic ? Citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach out and touch someone " ? This tree , for instance . ( Kneels beside the sapling , sings : ) I 'm the Robin Hood of Saplings , I watch over the small treesand when I see one brokenit brings me to my knees . ( Beat . ) At the end of the day , you 're still an ignorant man , George , and so are you , Greg , sorry . You do n't care about the future , about the air the children of tomorrow will need to breathe . You 're selfish , poor , a measly excuse for a working class . p. 43 GEORGE Fuck you . I 'm upper working class . ( David moves to George , smacking him across the face with each word he speaks . He does this with measured boredom ; George is passive . ) DAVID You ( Smack ) poor , ( Smack ) ignorant ( Smack ) bigot . ( Beat ) Feel any better ? ( George nods . ) I understand you , George . Your psychological make-up is painfully clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went ahead and did your show against my better judgment . You 're going to have to drag . GREG No . DAVID George ? GEORGE I do n't want to . It hurts . DAVID Learning is painful . ( Takes a small piece of barbed wire from his pocket ) Open your mouth , George . GREG I said no . DAVID I heard you . A powerful word , is n't it ? " No . " " No . " " No . " Though it depends on who 's saying it . ( Beat ) I 'm not correcting you , Greg . I 'm correcting George . GREG I do n't want blood on my shirt . That 's my shirt he 's wearing . p. 44 DAVID Take off the shirt , George . ( George begins to do so after a moment 's reluctance . ) GREG Put it back on , George . ( George starts to . ) DAVID George . GEORGE I do n't want to drag . It hurts . GREG Get back in the car , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . Just this once , do me a favor . I do n't think I 've asked for one in a while . DAVID ( After a silence ) : Put the shirt back on , George . GREG Thanks . I mean it . Thanks . ( Beat ) Thanks , thanks , thanks . Why am I always thanking you ? You pull this every time . Why do you get to decide when and how we do our stuff , where we have to stand ? DAVID ( Ignores Greg ) : No drag , got it , George ? But repeat after me : " I am the ignorant one  --  " GEORGE ( Repeats with toleration rather than obedience ) : " I am the ignorant one  --  " DAVID "  --  the humped one  --  " GEORGE "  --  the humped one  --  " p. 45 DAVID "  --  the the " ( Snaps his fingers so Greg will give him his line ) Is n't anyone helping out anymore ? GREG Looks like things are going to hell pretty quick , heh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish my story ! DAVID I give up . GEORGE So I hunt Mexicans . It 's not a personal thing . Why should I like them ? ( Turns to David ) But I like you . You wear nice clothes . You let me mow your lawn . DAVID ( Sniffs under his arms ) : My armpits are odor free . GREG You do n't itch your crotch in public . GEORGE I mean , how could I hate you when you gave me your old Adidas and bought my flag for me at Kmart ? DAVID So there are no inappropriate feelings ? ( Greg shrugs . ) GEORGE Naw . ( Beat ) Well , how did you like it ? ( They ignore him . ) DAVID ( To Greg ) : It 's ten o'clock . p. 46 GREG Shut up , George . Let 's shift . GEORGE Just a fuckin ' minute . After you guys went you got some fuckin ' feedback . It 's my turn now . I get my minute in the sun . DAVID But really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Greg laughs with David . ) GREG A camel ? I 'm tired of this . It 's time to move . GEORGE Yeah . A camel . Is a camel worth any less than a radish ? Than a half-breed with a heart split in two ? DAVID Have you ever stopped to consider the size of a camel 's turd ? GEORGE OK , OK . But you guys are screwed , because my camel could eat your radish any day . But , you know , I had a rhythm going , and you just moved in , without even asking , and fucked it up . GREG You 're pathetic , George . You did n't have a rhythm going . You never had a rhythm going . DAVID Do n't be too hard on him . He 's mentally challenged . GREG ( Turns on David ) : Is he ? Well , let 's not forget you 're only hanging out with us , Mr. Educado , due to our good graces . But you know , I think it 's time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID Please . Not that . Let me stay with you fellows . Let me get some dirt on my boots , some oil under my fingernails . GREG I 've been thinking . All these years I wanted to ask you , but I figured better not because you 're my friend . But I want to know . Now . What else ? What else from the root family , huh , David ? Is it only radishes , or do you get hot over tubers as well ? Most of all , did you have the guts to try them out on yourself before you did your sister in ? GEORGE What 's a tuber ? DAVID A tuber is a situation like this one . Stuck in the ground with no place to grow . Snore , snore . You two Boy Scouts are getting so predictable I 'm going to have to go back to playing tennis at the club . GREG ( Sniffs David ) : You know , I 've never liked the way you smell . DAVID You mean I 've practiced all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here ? DAVID Did I ever mention to you two that I finally hired myself a maid ? GEORGE A beaner ? DAVID Only the best . Guess what I named her , Greg ? GREG Maid . p. 48 DAVID Getting warmer . GEORGE Cleanie-beanie ? DAVID Colder . GREG I 'll tell you what the difference is , David . Like all of them in your club : you wear deodorant , but you ca n't hide the stink . A real handicap . DAVID I gave her a special name . ( Beat ) In honor of Greg , of course . GEORGE You see , Greg ? He likes you . ( Beat ) Watch this trick : I can eat a rock . GREG No . No . I do n't want to see you eat a rock . I do n't want to see you swallow a beer cap . I do n't want to see you put a centipede down your pants . Stop trying to act like a funny guy . You 're no more worthless than the rest of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart . Sometimes . GEORGE I am ? DAVID This is This is Words fail me . GREG As a matter of fact , you 're a winner . GEORGE A winner ? GREG Who spots the most beaners on a weekly basis ? GEORGE Me ? p. 49 GREG Yes . You . Who spots the least ? GEORGE David . GREG And you know why ? Because he gets paid not only for the beaners he turns in , but for the ones he lets cross . GEORGE Lets cross ? DAVID Greg . GREG As a matter of fact , he gets paid a bonus for the athletic types he lets through . The ones that can do the hard labor . GEORGE ( To David ) : That 's not true , is it , David ? DAVID Hey Greg . About that money you owe me . GEORGE You get paid for letting them cross ? DAVID I think I 'll need it by tomorrow . GEORGE Why ? Why ? GREG Because David knows he 's got to let in just enough beaners to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of living ? It 's a very good standard , too . Do n't forget it . GEORGE I ca n't believe this . DAVID But there 's another reason you 've left out , Greg . I want to share . p. 50 GREG Share ? DAVID Certainly . This is the melting pot , is n't it ? If we keep everyone out , we 'll lose the mix . GEORGE You lied to me , David . You never did that to me before . DAVID So has Greg . He knew all about it . GEORGE Greg ? GREG If it were n't for David , we would n't even have the deal with the feds to begin with . GEORGE Well , fuck you . Fuck you both , I 'm going home . DAVID ( Takes George 's face in his hands ) : Hey , I 'm still your friend . I 've taken good enough care of you so far , have n't I ? Who helped you out on your electric bill last month ? ( Beat ) You see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's less angry now . ) That 's right . I am . And I 'll tell you what . Just to show you I 'm respectable about it , I 'm inviting you over so you can finger my new maid 's teeth . It will tickle your innards . No charge . GREG You really fell for that molar story , did n't you , you hijo de la gran puta , son of a bitch . DAVID Something tells me that lately you 've begun to feel uncomfortable about our relationship . p. 51 GREG No . This is n't a friendship thing . We 've always been amigos . Father , Son and the Holy Ghost , right ? GEORGE I want to be the ghost . Hey ! Look ! There 's three of them ! ( David pays no attention to George . Greg is torn between helping George and confronting David . ) DAVID Then Simon says , " What is it ? " GEORGE Oh , shit . They 're going to charge . Come on , Greg ! GREG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it out here . ( To border ) Go back ! Go back ! We 're not ready for you ! DAVID Oh , please . Are we going to have another " David thinks he 's got gold for shit and only hangs out with us , hoping it will rub off " episodes ? Or how about the rerun where you curse me and George for feeling up the chicks we catch just because you have n't got the stomach to join in . GREG I never wanted to join in . I just wanted the ten bucks a hit . GEORGE Will you two cut the shit and look alive before we lose these guys ? DAVID Shut up , George . ( To Greg ) Or perhaps you never joined in because of the difficulty you have in getting an erection that will last more than three seconds . p. 52 GEORGE I do n't want to talk about Greg 's dick ! GREG ( Refuses to let David " get " him ) : If the feds ever changed their minds , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID You think they do n't know what we 're up to ? You really are confused . GEORGE A hundred feet away from us and we 're letting them cross . That 's thirty bucks down the drain . GREG Well , if they ever did decide to burn us , they 'd burn me and George , not you . Not you , because you 've got a Lawn-Boy rider and a concrete pool . GEORGE Let 's talk about my show . I want to talk about it ! DAVID ( To Greg ) : My , you are breathing rapidly . You must be ill . Should we call it quits for the night ? But we still have n't guessed what I named my maid ? ( No response from Greg ) I named her Evalina . ( Beat ) I did it for you . And all I get in return is a  --  GREG ( Interrupts ) : You named your maid Evalina ? Evalina ? Is she one of the chosen ones you let through ? I bet she loves her job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brushes her teeth ? p. 53 DAVID Teeth . Teeth . It 's got into your subconscious , has n't it , son ? GREG Tell us how you caught her , David , tell us what you said to her to make her feel safe . Tell us . Which fence line ? DAVID You 're tiresome . GREG Did she walk across or did she crawl ? What was it like ? Hey , David , was it like this ? ( Greg crawls from the border . Though he pretends to be a Mexican woman , it is important that his voice is not affected . He does not try to " sound " like a woman , instead he speaks with his own voice . He may affect a slight accent but then drop it when the action gets more violent . ) Hallo ! Hallo ! Gringo . Do you have a job for me ? Gringo . Gringo . Can you help me ? ( As Greg speaks , David begins to circle him , joining in the game . ) DAVID How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gringo . I want to work . I like work . ( David trips Greg and pushes him to his knees . ) DAVID So you like to work ? ( George gets into the game . David and George both interrogate Greg . ) GEORGE What kind of work ? p. 54 GREG Anything . I need money . Dinero . Dinero . DAVID What for ? GEORGE What for ? GREG For pretty clothes ? DAVID ( Smacks Greg in the head ) : Stupid answer . Try again . Why do you want money ? GREG I 'm hungry . ( Beat ) I 'm starving . GEORGE ( Picks up a handful of dirt ) : Then open up . I got a McDonald 's for you . ( George forces dirt in Greg 's mouth . Greg spits it out and attempts to rise . David forces him back onto his knees . ) DAVID So you want me to give you a job , heh , sweetheart ? Why do n't you get a nice job in your own hometown ? GEORGE ( Kicks Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here and take mine ? DAVID You better answer old George , miss , or he 'll throw you to the border wolf . ( Beat ) Answer him , you bitch ! GREG Because Because DAVID Answer him . GREG Because there 's no jobs in my hometown . The Yankee pays better over here than the Yankee does over there . ( Beat ) Putas . Todos los Yankees . p. 55 DAVID Did you hear that , George ? Cursed at me in Mexican . The bitch . ( David slaps Greg . ) GEORGE The bitch . DAVID But I 'm a nice guy . I 'll give you a job .

I watched her pour a whole bottle of detergent in the wash . Then she said , like she might be saying , " That 's the third load today , " " I thought mine were the only ones . " Then she hit me . ( Greg moves to David , takes David 's hand , and uses it to smack himself in the face .

I mean , when the moment hit you , when the crisis struck , which did you choose , Hostess or Sara Lee ? JVC or Sony ? I mean , is n't that the simple beauty of it : who can afford to hire a maid and who ca n't afford not to be one ? ( George moves slightly , as though he is thinking to run for it. ) p. 64 GEORGE Let me go , Greg . I got to get home . GREG Hey , do n't you want to play a game ? This is your game , David .
