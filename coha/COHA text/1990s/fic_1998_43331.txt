YOU KNOW HOW IT IS : <p> There 's a bar on the corner , where hardly anybody knows your name , and you like it that way . Live bands play there two or three nights a week . Before they start up it 's nice , and on the nights they do n't play - there 's a good jukebox , the big TV 's on low on ESPN all the time . At his prices , the owner should be a millionaire , but he 's given his friends so many free drinks they 've forgotten they should pay for more than every third or fourth one . Not that you know the owner , but you 've watched . <p> You go there when your life 's good , you go there when your life 's bad ; mostly you go there instead of having a good or bad life . <p> And one night , fairly crowded , you 're on the stools so the couples and the happy people can have the booths and tables .

But Aunt Nonie ( their Mom 's youngest sister ) was off in Egypt on a cruise she 'd won in a slogan contest for pitted dates , so it fell to Aunt joanie , ( their Father 's oldest sister ) to keep them the two weeks . <p> Their father 's side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbent toward a child a little , some other family member would be around to remind them they were just children . Their cousins on that side of the family ( not that Aunt Joanie or Uncle Arthridge had any kids ) were like mice ; they had to take off their shoes and put on house slippers when they got home from school ; they could never go into the family room ; they had to be in bed by 8:30 P.M. , even when the sun was still up in the summer . <p> Uncle Arthridge was off in California , so it was just them and Aunt joanie , who , through no fault of her own , looked just like the Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , which they had seen with Aunt Nonie the summer before . <p> They arrived by train , white tags stuck to them like turkeys in a raffle , and a porter had made sure they were comfortable . When Irene had been upset , realizing she would be away from home , and was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to sniffle , Eldon held her hand . He was still at the age where he could hold his sister 's hand against the world and think nothing of it . <p> Aunt Joanie was waiting for them in the depot on the platform , and handed the porter a $1 tip , which made him smile . <p> And then Aunt Joanie drove them , allowing them to sit in the front seat of her Plymouth , to her house , and there they were . At first , he thought it might be a radio . <p> It was up on legs , the bottom of them looking like eagle claws holding a wooden ball . It was n't a sewing machine cabinet , or a table . It might be a liquor cabinet , but there was n't a keyhole . <p> It was the second day at Aunt Joanie 's and he was already cranky . Irene had had a crying jag the night before and their aunt had given them some ice cream . <p> He was exploring . He already knew every room ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio was in the front room ; this was in the sitting room at the back . <p> One of the reasons they had n't wanted to come to Aunt Joanie 's was that she had no television , like their downstairs neighbors , the Stevenses , did back in the city . They 'd spent the first part of summer vacation downstairs in front of it , every chance they got . Two weeks at Aunt Nonie 's without television would have been great , because she would n't have given them time to think , and would have them exhausted by bedtime anyway . <p> But two weeks at Aunt Joanie 's and Uncle Arthridge 's without television was going to be murder . She had let them listen to radio , but not the scary shows , or anything good . And Johnny Dollar and Suspense were n't on out here , she was sure . <p> So he was looking at the cabinet in the sitting room . It had the eagleclaw legs . It was about three feet wide , and the part that was solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was two feet of cabinet above that . At the back was a rounded part , with air holes in it , like a Lincoln Continental spare tire holder . He ran his hand over it - it was made out of that same stuff as the backs of radios and televisions . <p> There were two little knobs on the front of the cabinet though he could n't see a door . He pulled on them . Then he turned and pulled on them . They opened , revealing three or four other knobs , and a metal toggle switch down at the right front comer . They did n't look like radio controls . It did n't look like a television either . There was no screen . There was no big lightning-bolt moving dial like on their radio at home in the city . <p> Then he noticed a double-line of wood across the top front of it , like on the old ice-box at his grandfather 's . He pushed on it from the floor . Something gave , but he could n't make it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of it . <p> " What are you doing ? " asked Irene . <p> " This must be another radio , " he said . " This part lifts up . " <p> He climbed atop the stool . He had a hard time getting his fingers under the ridge . He pushed . <p> The whole top of the thing lifted up a few inches . He could see glass . Then it was too heavy . He lifted at it again after it dropped down , and this time it came up halfway open . <p> There was glass on the under-lid . It was a mirror . He saw the reflection of part of the room . Something else moved below the mirror , inside the cabinet . <p> " Aunt Joanie 's coming ! " said Irene . <p> He dropped the lid and pushed the stool away and closed the doors . " What are you two little cautions doing ? " asked Aunt Joanie from the other room . <p> THE NEXT MORNING , when Aunt Joanie went to the store on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inner lid was a mirror that stopped halfway up , at an angle . Once he got it to a certain point , it clicked into place . There was a noise from inside and another click . <p> He looked down into it . There was a big dark glass screen . <p> " It 's a television ! " he said . <p> " Can we get Howdy-Doody ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . <p> " You better ask Aunt Joanie , or you 'll get in trouble . " <p> He clicked the toggle switch . Nothing happened . <p> " It does n't work , " he said . <p> " Maybe it 's not plugged in , " said Irene . <p> Eldon lay down on the bare floor at the edge of the area rug , saw the prongs of a big electric plug sticking out underneath . He pulled on it . The cord uncoiled from behind . He looked around for the outlet . The nearest one was on the far wall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joanie , stepping into the room with a small grocery bag in her arms . <p> " Is ... is this a television set ? " asked Eldon . <p> " Can we get Howdy-Doody ? " asked Irene . <p> Aunt Joanie put down the sack . " It is a television . But it wo n't work anymore . There 's no need to plug it in . It 's an old-style one , from before the war . They do n't work like that anymore . Your uncle Arthridge and I bought it in 1938 . There were no broadcasts out here then , but we thought there would be soon . " <p> As she was saying this , she stepped forward , took the cord from Eldon 's hands , rewound it and placed it behind the cabinet again . <p> " Then came the War , and everything changed . These kind wo n't work anymore . So we sha n't be playing with it , shall we ? It 's probably dangerous by now . " <p> " Ca n't we try it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think so , " said Aunt Joanie . " Please put it out of your mind . Go wash up now , we 'll have lunch soon . " <p> Three days before they left , they found themselves alone in the house again , in the early evening . It had rained that afternoon , and was cool for summer . <p> Irene heard scraping in the sitting room . She went there and found Eldon pushing the television cabinet down the bare part of the floor toward the electrical outlet on the far wall . <p> He plugged it in . Irene sat down in front of it , made herself comfortable . " You 're going to get in trouble , " she said . " What if it explodes ? " <p> He opened the lid . They saw the reflection of the television screen in it from the end of the couch . <p> He flipped the toggle . Something hummed , there was a glow in the back , and they heard something spinning . Eldon put his hand near the round part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan . He could see lights through the holes in the cabinet , and something was moving . <p> He twisted a small knob , and light sprang up in the picture-tube part , enlarged and reflected in the mirror on the lid . Lines of bright static moved up the screen and disappeared in a repeating pattern . <p> He turned another knob , the larger one , and the bright went dark and then bright again . <p> Then a picture came in . <p> They watched those last three days , every time Aunt Joanie left ; afraid at first , watching only a few minutes , then turning it off , unplugging it , and closing it up and pushing it back into its place , careful not to scratch the floor . <p> Then they watched more , and more , and there was an excitement each time they went through the ritual , a tense expectation . <p> Since no sound came in , what they saw they referred to as " Mr. Goober 's Show , " from his shape , and his motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anytime they turned the TV on . <p> They left Aunt Joanie 's reluctantly . She had never caught them watching it . They took the train home . <p> Eldon was in a kind of anxiety . He talked to all his friends , who knew nothing about anything like that , and some of them had been as far away as San Francisco during the summer . The only person he could talk to about it was his little sister , Irene . <p> He did not know what the jumpiness in him was . <p> They rushed into Aunt Joanie 's house the first time they visited at Christmas , and ran to the sitting room . <p> The wall was blank . <p> They looked at at each other , then ran back into the living room . <p> " Aunt Joanie ! " said Eldon , interrupting her , Uncle Arthridge and his father . " Aunt Joanie , where 's the television ? " <p> " Television ... ? Oh , that thing . I sold it to a used furniture man at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinetry , he said , and was going to make an aquarium out of it . I suppose he sold the insides for scrap . " <p> They grew up , talking to each other , late at nights , about what they had seen . When their family got TV , they spent their time trying to find it again . <p> Then high school , then college , the ' 60s . Eldon went to Nam , came back about the same . <p> Irene got a job in television , and sent him letters , while he taught bookkeeping at a junior college . <p> Dear Bro ' <p> I ran down what kind of set Aunt Joanie had . <p> It was a mechanical television , with a Nipkov disk scanner . <p> It was a model made between 1927 and 1929 . <p> Mechanical : yes . You light a person , place , thing , very very brightly . On one side of the studio are photoelectric cells that turn light to current . Between the subject and the cells , you drop in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the disk , and spiraling inward all the way around to the center are holes . You have a slitscan shutter . As the light leaves the subject it 's broken into a series of lines by the holes passing across the slit . The photoelectric cells pick up the pulses of light . ( An orthicon tube does exactly the same thing , except electronically , in a camera , and your modern TV is just a big orthicon tube on the other end . ) Since it was a mechanical signal , your disk in the cabinet at home had to spin at exactly the same rate . So they had to send out a regulating signal at the same time . <p> Not swell , not good definition , but workable . <p> But Aunt Joanie ( rest her soul ) was right - nothing in 1953 was broadcasting that it could receive , because all early pre-war televisions were made with the picture-portion going out on FM and the sound going out on short-wave ( so her set had receivers for both ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavelengths ( where they 've been since 1946 ) . <p> Mr. Goober could not have come from an FCC licensed broadcaster in 1953 . I 'll check Canada and Mexico , but I 'm pretty sure everything was moved off those bands by then , even experimental stations . Since we never got sound , either there was none , or maybe it was coming in with the picture ( like now ) and her set could n't separate four pieces of information ( one-half each of two signals , which is why we use FM for TV ) . <p> It should n't have happened , I do n't think . There are weird stories ( the ghost signals of a Midwest station people saw the test patterns of more than a year after they quit broadcasting ; the famous 2.8 second delay in radio transmissions all over the world on shortwave in 1927 and early 1928 ) . <p> Am going to the NAB meeting in three weeks . Will talk to everybody there , especially the old guys , and find out if any of them knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your sis , <p> Irene <p> Eldon began the search on his own ; at parties , at bars , at ball games . During the next few years , he wrote his sister with bits of fugitive matter he 'd picked up . And he got quite a specialized knowledge of local TV shows , kid 's show clowns , Shock Theater hosts , and eclectic local programming of the early 1950s , throughout these United States . <p> June 25 , 1979 <p> Dear Eldon <p> Sorry it took so long to get this letter off to you , but I 've been busy at work , and helping with the Fund Drive , and I also think I 'm onto something . I 've just run across stuff that indicates there was some kind of medical outfit that used radio in the late ' 40s and early ' 50s . <p> Hope you can come home for Christmas this time . Mom 's getting along in years , you know . I know you had your troubles with her ( I 'm the one to talk ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's an old person trying to get into Heaven now . She 's trying to be good the second thirty years of her life <p> Will write you again as soon as I find out more about these quacks . Your little sister , Irene <p> Dear Big Brother : <p> August 14 , 1979 <p> Well , it 's depressing here . The lead I had turned out to be a bust , and I could just about cry , since I thought this might be it , since they broadcast on both shortwave and FM ( like Aunt Joanie 's set received ) but this probably was n't it , either . <p> It was called Drown Radio Therapy ( there 's something poetic about the name , but not the operation ) . It was named for Dr. Ruth Drown , she was a real osteopath . Sometime before the War , she and a technocrat started working with a lowpower broadcast device . By War 's end , she was claiming she could treat disease at a distance , and set up a small broadcast station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were diagnosed , and given a schedule of broadcast times they were supposed to tune in . ( The broadcasts were directly to each patient , supposedly , two or three times a day . ) By the late ' 40s , she 'd also gone into TV , which is of course FM ( the radio stuff being shortwave . That 's where I 'd hoped I 'd found someone broadcasting at the same time on both bands . <p> But probably no go . She franchised the machines out to other doctors , mostly naturopaths and cancer quacks . It 's possible that one was operating near Aunt Joanie 's somewhere , but probably not , and anyway , a committee of docs investigated her stuff . What they found was that the equipment was so low-powered it could only broadcast a dozen miles ( not counting random skipping , bouncing off the Heaviside layer , which it would n't have been able to reach ) . Essentially they ruled the equipment worthless . <p> And , the thing that got to me , there was no picture transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same type of random signals that went out on short-wave , on the same schedule , every day . Even if you had a rogue cancer specialist , the FCC said the stuff could n't broadcast a visual signal , not with the technology of the time . ( The engineer at the station here looked at the specs and said Seven if they had access to video orthicon tubes , the signal would n't have gotten across the room , ' unless it was on cable , which it was n't . ) <p> I 've gone on too long . It 's not it . <p> Sorry to disappoint you ( again ) . But I 'm still going through back files of Variety and DM and everything put out by the networks in those years . And , maybe a motherlode , a friend 's got a friend who knows where all the Dumont records ( except Gleason 's ) are stored . <p> We 'll find out yet , brother . I 've heard stories of people waiting twenty , thirty , forty years to clear things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting he 'd read a serialized novel in a newspaper , about the fall of civilization , in the early 1920s . Pre-bomb , pre-almost everything . He was only a kid when he read it . Ten years ago he mentioned it to someone who had a friend who recognized it , not from a newspaper , but as a book called Darkness and the Dawn . It was in three parts , and serial rights were sold , on the first part only , to , like three newspapers in the whole U.S. And the man , now in his sixties , had read it in one of them . <p> Things like that do happen , kiddo . <p> write me when you can . <p> Love , <p> Irene I 'm ready to give up on this . It 's running me crazy - not crazy , but to distraction , if I had anything else to be distracted from . <p> I ca n't see any way out of this except to join the Welcome Space Brothers Club , which I refuse to do . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go over to the Cheesy Side of the Force . You and me saw a travelog , a SeeIt-Now of the Planets , hosted by an interstellar Walter Cronkite on a Nipkov disk TV in 1953 . We 're the only people in the world who did . No one else . <p> But that 's why CE3K and the others have made so many millions of dollars . People want to believe , but they want to believe for other people , not themselves . Thev do n't want to be the ones . They want someone else to be the one . And then they want everybody to believe . But it 's not their ass out there saying : the Space Brothers are here ; I ca n't prove it , take my word for it , it 's real .

It is my life , and yours , and it 's all I 've got . <p> I know what Mr. Goober was trying to tell us , and there was more , but the sound was off . <p> I 'm tired . I 'll write you next week when I can call my life my own again . <p> Your Sis <p> Cops called from Irene 's town the next week . <p> After the funeral , and the stay at his mother 's , and the inevitable fights , with his stepfather trying to stay out of it , he came home and found one more letter , postmarked the same day as the police had called him . <p> Dear Eldon <p> Remember this , and do n't think less of me : What we saw was real . <p> Evidently , too real for me . <p> Find out what we saw . <p> Love always , <p> Irene <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the low hum and thump of noise as the band sets up , and over in the comer , two people will be talking . You 'll hear the word " Lucy " which could be many things - a girlfriend , a TV show , a late President 's daughter , a 4-million-year-old ape-child . Then you 'll hear " M-Squad " or " Untouchables " and there 'll be more talk , and you 'll hear distinctly , during a noise-level drop , " ... and I do n't mean Johnny-fucking-Jupiter either ... " <p> And in a few minutes he 'll leave , because the band will have started , and conversation , except at the 100-decibel level , is over for the night . <p> But he 'll be back tomorrow night .
