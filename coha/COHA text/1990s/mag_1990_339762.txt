Their high-pitched whinnies roll across the plains like a tumbleweed- scatteri ng wind . At dusk one of them rears and paws the air , casting a silhouette that is the very image of freedom . These are mustangs , the legendary wild horses of the American West . Two decades ago , mustangs were headed for extinction . Now , at Mustang Meadows Ranch , a 32,000-acre spread near St. Francis , S. Dak. , 1,500 of them have found sanctuary and a managed independence that may help assure their survival . <P> Descended from horses that escaped from Spanish herds , millions of mustangs roamed the prairie at the start of the 19th century . But as the wildness went out of the West and more and more rangeland was plowed for crops or fenced off ( for cattle , the number of mustangs dwindled . By 1970 only 17,000 were left , despite the passage of federal laws that banned the use of airplanes and motor vehicles to round them up for slaughter . In 1971 Congress responded to a massive letter-writing campaign by enacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal Bureau of Land Management the responsibility for protecting these " living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West . " <P> Under BLM , the mustangs have recovered : 42,000 horses now run free on the range . But their numbers have greatly surpassed the ability of the land to support them . To ease the overpopulation , BLM in 1976 inaugurated a national Adopt-a-Horse program , under which 90,000 wild horses have been sold to private owners . But the mustangs taken off the range annually include many that are too old , crippled , ugly or mean to make good pets . Until two years ago , thousands of unadoptable mustangs were crowded into dusty feeding pens in Nebraska , Nevada and Texas at a cost to taxpayers of $13 million a year . <P> Enter Dayton Hyde , an Oregon rancher with a reputation for unorthodox management and a deep interest in conservation . " In my travels I kept going by feedlots seeing these poor creatures cooped up , " says Hyde , 64 . " I thought , That 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get these horses out of the feedlots and running free again . " <P> In 1988 Hyde founded the nonprofit Institute for Range and the American Mustang in order to create sanctuaries  --  retirement homes of sorts  --  where unadoptable wild horses could once again roam freely . He convinced BLM that with foundation and public funds he could establish a self-sustaining sanctuary within three years . IRAM 's first project was a 12,600-acre sanctuary in the Black Hills of South Dakota that opened last year . Tourists pay $15 to view 300 mustangs running on high plateaus of ponderosa pine . The project makes Hyde smile . " The horses are finally getting over their depression , " he says . " They got so bored in the feedlots that they did n't know how to run anymore . " <P> Hyde 's ambition went beyond his successes at the Black Hills sanctuary . He next sought to establish a larger range that could accommodate thousands of horses . But since IRAM lacked both money and land , Hyde needed the help of a private investor . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranches in Arizona and Nebraska . Day , says Hyde , " knew how to manage grass and was not afraid of the immensity of my dream . "
