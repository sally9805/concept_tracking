At a rally in Chicago last week for the nation 's two teachers ' unions , the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers , the scene appeared straight out of one of those old melodramas with vocal audience participation . The guest speaker , Vice President Al Gore , had only to mention the villains  --  Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich , " the Ginsu gang , " who " tried to chop , slice and dice all those things that are important to us "  --  and hisses filled the air . The heroes , too , were just as easy to identify . " We love all our teachers , " Gore told the pumped-up , cheering crowd . " We do n't bash them . " <P> Long before last week , of course , the Clinton-Gore campaign had known it could count on the votes of the majority of members of the N.E.A. and the smaller A.F.T. , a politically active bloc some 2.5 million strong that traditionally backs Democratic candidates . ( Since it was established in 1972 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But in July , Dole began attacking these organizations by name , railing against the evil influence of " the teachers ' unions " much as George Bush used to invoke the A.C.L.U. During his speech to the Republican Convention in San Diego , Dole fulminated , " I say this not to the teachers , but to their unions : If education were a war , you would be losing it . If it were a business , you would be driving it into bankruptcy . If it were a patient , it would be dying . " Now , as some new N.E.A. posters are proclaiming , America 's teachers ( 90% of whom belong to a union ) are MAD AND MOBILIZED . <P> Dole 's attack on the teachers ' unions is " the single most mystifying thing we 've seen , ' ' says White House press secretary Mike McCurry . Notes Joe Lockhart , press secretary for the Clinton-Gore campaign : " People do n't see the teachers as Big Labor , like the Steelworkers . " But they do see an education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines brought fresh evidence : 91,000 students without classroom space in New York City , a bankrupt board closing schools in the District of Columbia , buildings crumbling , test scores falling . Voters are looking for someone to blame , and the Dole campaign is trying to capitalize on the perception  --  and sometime reality  --  that the unions , rich , powerful and self-protective , are part of the problem , not part of the solution . <P> Certainly , the N.E.A. and the A.F.T . have a history of resisting changes , from curriculum reform to teacher certification to merit pay . But as unionized teachers see it , the fierce struggles to protect their jobs , their raises and their work rules are part of a bigger war to save the very institution of public education in a climate of budget cutbacks and ideological polarization . " Blaming teachers for problems in education is like blaming doctors for aids , ' ' says Susan Moore Johnson , a dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education . " The problem with public education in this country has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and community . "
