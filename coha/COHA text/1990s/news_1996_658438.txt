<p> To inaugurate the renovated SoHo branch of the Guggenheim Museum in June , director Thomas Krens did not cut a ribbon , he flipped a switch . Instantly , 215 video monitors of a work called " Megatron " by Nam June Paik lit up . As Madonna 's recorded voice blared the lyrics " over the borderline , " a barrage of images flitted across rows of screens . In hyperkinetic succession , video footage of Olympic runners switched to Korean dancers , a garish sunset , and an animated goose flapping giant wings . <p> Ron Sommer , chairman of Deutsche Telekom , the exhibit 's sponsor , called the rehabilitated space " the museum of the next millennium . " If so , prepare for Star Trek meets Vegas . <p> According to Mr. Krens , this branch of the Guggenheim has redefined its mission to be " responsive " to its surrounding culture . A thousand or so software and multimedia companies have sprung up in SoHo , dubbed Silicon Alley . Hence , the museum plans to showcase the latest developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediascape , " through September 15 presents 14 works by 10 artists working in multimedia and computer-based digital art . <p> Viewed in the continuum of art history , the pieces are an updated version of machine aesthetic . ( If this were a computer program , the reader could now activate hyperlinks to earlier art-and-technology fusion movements like Futurism , Constructivism , Bauhaus , and kinetic sculpture . ) Yet in many ways , digital art is new . It is , says John Fujii , 1996 conference chair of the computer-graphics organization SIGGRAPH , " growing like wildfire . " <p> Some of the works in " Mediascape " are immersive environments created by established artists like Jenny Holzer and Bill Viola . Other interactive works depend on viewer participation , converting art from a noun to a verb . As the most visible of an increasing number of recent shows of digital art , the exhibition reveals both the promise and pitfalls of electronic art . <p> Digital multimedia art has been around for over a decade , but the museum-going public is just beginning to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University 's Center for Advanced Technology in Digital Multimedia , defines it as " generally a combination of sound , image , and text . " She adds , electronic art is " usually interactive ; that is , the user can drive the playback of the piece in different ways . " Through pointing and clicking a mouse , the viewer chooses which portion of preformatted content the computer program will display . <p> Bill Seaman 's " Passage Sets/One Pulls Pivots at the Tip of the Tongue " takes up an entire wall . A left-hand panel contains words of a poem , while at right is a video of a figure gesturing in slow motion . In the center , the viewer can click on a menu to change text and images , generating a new poem . The atmosphere in the darkened gallery resembles a Beatnik-era coffeehouse , as improvised poems float on the screen to the tune of bongos and moody jazz . " I 'm interested in the notion that the artist has an intention and the viewer , in navigating the work , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaman explains . <p> This is a basic difference in how digital , compared to conventional , art works . " The strongly interactive aspect is virtually unprecedented , " says Daniel Sandin , professor and co-director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory specializing in virtual reality at the University of Illinois , Chicago . " This has got to be a new medium . " <p> Which raises the question , " Who 's in charge here ? " Or , as Randy Pausch , associate professor of computer science at the University of Virginia , Charlottesville , puts it : " Is this a story-telling medium with a director or author in control of a predetermined sequence , or is the creator at best a tour guide ? " In practice , the interactive medium " promises the viewer collaboration in creating the piece , but in fact , there are usually only two or three preconfigured options , " Hartzell admits . Seaman compares the process to a building created by an architect , where the users decide which rooms to enter . " I 've loaded the dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another major difference between the new art as process , compared to " old " art as product , is its scope . " The works in ' Mediascape ' are more three-dimensional than an object that exists in one location , " says Matthew Drucker , co-curator of the Guggenheim show . " The concept of being in a room that is itself a work of art is the case with this work rather than being in a room that holds works of art . " <p> Total auditory and visual immersion is the goal , with each gallery space dedicated to a different perceptual experience . In Jenny Holzer 's untitled installation , light-emitting diode ( LED ) bands of words in red , green , and black race across three walls of a white-painted room . Aphorisms stream by without letup . After a few minutes , the racing letters blend into bands of color reflected on the floor . It 's like being saturated with pulsing color inside a fluorescent tube . <p> " It 's important that each piece has a realm for itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ursula Frohne , whose institution , ZKM/Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe , Germany , loaned most of the works to the show . Since multimedia art requires " more energy from the viewer , " she adds , " viewers have to spend time to see the whole piece . " <p> Joseph Squier , assistant professor of electronic media at the University of Illinois , Champaign/Urbana , curated a 1995 exhibition of digital art called " Art as Signal . " He says , " The revolutionary , fundamental difference is that electronic art is not an object or a thing on a wall . It 's experiential . " At the Krannert Art Museum show he installed , " The atmosphere was not quiet like going to church . People were very active , talking and laughing . " <p> " Cyberpainter " Roz Dimon curated a much-discussed show of electronic art at Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New York City . " The gallery was alive with people of all ages . There was a three-hour wait to get in , " she says . <p> Besides appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drawn to the new art because it reflects their daily lives - especially the experience of a generation weaned on MTV and video games . " Young people are very excited about multimedia art , " says Marge Myers , assistant director of the Studio for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . " Those are the ones we 're worried about losing as art appreciators , so if we can appeal to them , the effect will be only positive . " <p> Some worry that the high-tech rather than high-touch approach may transform art into entertainment . Others applaud the art world 's becoming more populist and connected to pop culture . " That 's where electronic work is going , " says Professor Squier . " The artist can make a work that 's seductive with entertainment value , but which functions on a higher plane as well . " <p> Denying a " dumbing down " tendency , Guggenheim co-curator Nancy Spector says the criteria applied in selecting works for " Mediascape " are " the same as with traditional art . " Admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a relevant question to ask is " Does the work transcend its own equipment ? " <p> By this standard , " Mediascape " has hits and misses . Jeffrey Shaw 's " The Legible City " is a big ho-hum after you get over the novelty of riding a stationary bike in a gallery . By turning the handlebars , the user navigates through a cybercity , shown by block letters on a screen that spell out banal sayings . <p> Well-known artist Bill Viola also commits **26;312;TOOLONG . " Threshold " features an electronic signboard broadcasting a Reuters newsfeed . The viewer enters a darkened room through the middle of the signboard to discover the truth behind the headlines . Projected on three walls are images of gigantic sleeping heads . " Disaster strikes - dimwits doze ! " as a tabloid might title it . <p> Toshio Iwai 's " Piano - as Image Media " adds elements of play in a successful composition that achieves synesthesia of sight and sound . Viewers move a trackball to choose notes that visually zoom up a treadmill and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes sound , they rhythmically generate , on a vertical conveyer belt , images of whirling diamonds . Like abstract art , the content is elusive . Form and pure sensory experience dominate . <p> If this show contains the best examples of electronic art , one wonders if the hula-hoop effect is operating . Will digital art be the latest fad , then fade fast like Op Art or holography ? " For artists working in digital media , we 've invented canvas but nobody has figured out brushes , " says Professor Pausch . " When you compare interactive multimedia to oil on canvas , it 's painfully obvious that it looks lousy . " <p> Even much-hyped virtual reality is still a crude articulation of 3-D cartoon animation . Has anything like art with a capital " A " been produced in multimedia digital art ? " Absolutely not , " says David Yager , chair of visual arts at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County . Although software is evolving rapidly , the tools and the media are still in their infancy . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a computer monitor , the number of dots on the screen , the variable color , which fades when printed , all affect the viewer 's experience . <p> Emily Hartzell describes artists ' frustration at using the new medium : " We know how to create , but when we change our tools , figuring out how to reach people on a primal level is difficult . " <p> One big difference is that the new art is a result of a " Renaissance team " rather than a lone artist . So many skills are needed , including sound recording , programming , animation , and video editing , that rarely can an individual artist master them all . " The practice of art and design is changed by collaborative partnerships , " says Alan Samuels , dean of the School of Art and Design at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor . Mr. Samuels believes the new model of digital artist as team player will predominate . <p> The most electronic multimedia art is now produced in the two Silicon sites - Valley in the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in Los Angeles . <p> Bryan Rogers , chair of art and director of the Studio for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon , says , " This is not just a new trick . This is a major wave going through the culture . " The hope is that , as technology transforms society at an unprecedented pace , artists can interpret it . " If there is to be an art in our times , it will evolve with our times , " Mr. Rogers says . <p> Computer imaging has the potential to illuminate more than surface reality . It reflects what 's most distinctive about human beings and how we work . According to Rogers , " This is not just about new toys to make pictures faster . The frontier opened up is trickier , more exciting , and scarier at the same time . We should feel both threatened and find joy in it all . "
