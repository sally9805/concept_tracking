Let them hate . So long as they fear . <P>  --  Caligula <P> In the end , all dictators govern by fear . Long-suffering citizens obey orders only because they are convinced that a single individual has no hope of opposing the overwhelming forces loyal to the state . A dictator falls when fear changes sides , when individuals coalesce into crowds and defy him . Emboldened by the discovery that they are not alone , they take to the streets and squares to protest , and they learn  --  though sometimes at great cost  --  that no tyrant can kill or arrest an entire nation . At that point , despots lose the special combination of visible authority and legitimacy that the Chinese call " the mandate of heaven . " In 1989 it happened all over Eastern Europe , where the accelerating pace of reforms gave birth to the observation that Poland took ten years , Hungary ten months , East Germany ten weeks , Czechoslovakia ten days . <P> The people 's overthrow of President Nicolae Ceausescu 's paranoid dictatorship last week seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife Elena were ensconced in the presidential palace in Bucharest ; by Friday morning , they were gone . But unlike the bloodless revolutions in the rest of the Warsaw Pact countries , the Rumanian convulsion was soaked in blood . The number of casualties is still not known , but if the estimates of thousands killed turn out to be correct , Ceausescu 's name will be indelibly linked to one of the largest government-inflicted massacres since World War II . Ceausescu fled his grandiose palace only after the army refused to shoot demonstrators and many troops switched sides , joining them . <P> Hundreds of thousands of Rumanians took joyously to the streets , running , jumping , riding on tanks . " The army is with us ! " they shouted . " We are the people ! " Crowds stormed Ceausescu 's palace and rushed to the state television studio to put out the message " We won . The dictator has fallen . " Ceausescu 's son Nicu , party chief in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu ( pop . 173,000 ) , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised , and his eyes flicked in terror from side to side , as if seeking a way to escape . <P> But the country 's joy quickly turned to dread . Progovernment forces staged a fierce comeback in Bucharest and other cities , plunging the country into civil war . In the heart of the capital , troops of the well-equipped 180,000-member security forces , the Securitate , battled army units for control of the fire- gutted presidential palace . At one point , members of the security forces reportedly burst into a meeting of demonstrators at the Opera House and sprayed the room with submachine guns . The violence assumed its own macabre rhythms . Whenever the fighting lessened , citizens would flood into the streets to celebrate Ceausescu 's downfall ; when the fighting began again , they would flee for cover . <P> The death toll soared , with hundreds of bodies lying in the streets . There were even unconfirmed reports that Syrian and Libyan mercenaries were aiding the pro-Ceausescu forces . As the fighting intensified , Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev offered to send medical aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing bloodshed might even lead to direct Soviet intervention on the side of the revolutionaries .
