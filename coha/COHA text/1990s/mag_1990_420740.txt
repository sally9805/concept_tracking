Section : Lifestyle <p> When she learned that the cancer in her breast had spread to her leg , Susie Harris was scared . Her doctors said a controversial bone-marrow treatment was her best hope of survival . But a day before she was to undergo the $100,000 procedure , Harris 's insurance company refused to pay . She and her husband cashed in their savings , scraped up loans and she had the treatment anyway . Then they sued Blue Cross/Blue Shield , which has countersued , seeking a dismissal of her claim . " You have to go for it , fight for it , " says the 51-year-old Dallas grandmother , who has now been cancer-free for more than a year . " This is politics , pure politics . " <p> Molly Lazer got mad last August when a mammogram revealed a malignant lump in her breast . Her insurance company paid for the test every other year , but the 56-year-old Chicagoan had followed her doctor 's advice and had the test annually , paying herself in the offyears . This was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " If you could do a mammogram on the testes  --  a testegram  --  you 'd be goddam sure that men would be having them every year and that insurance would pay , " Lazer says angrily . " The insurance companies are run by men . It 's shameful . " <p> In the two years since Darcy Sixt was diagnosed with cancer , she has lost her left breast , her hair and her political innocence . " Women are too quiet , " says the 38-year-old California systems analyst . " We need to look out for ourselves . " Sixt joined a Bay Area chapter of a national breast-cancer advocacy group , Y-ME . Now she dreams of organizing a march on Washington that would draw 44,000 women : ' 7 want an aeri-alphoto with a caption that reads , ' This is how many of us die every year , and this is not acceptable ' . " <p> The same voices of anger are being raised all across America . After decades of private pain and quiet resignation , breast-cancer patients are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom and into the streets . They are incensed at callous doctors , parsimonious insurance companies , insensitive employers and a medical establishment that many believe has systematically ignored women 's health concerns . Most of all , they are appalled at the statistics : some 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year . More than a quarter of them will die as a result . The incidence is rising ominously . In 1960 , one in every 20 American women could expect to develop the disease in her lifetime . Today , it 's one in 10 . " It 's an epidemic and it has n't gotten enough attention , " says Dr. Susan Love , head of the Faulkner Breast Center in Boston . She and other activists note that the U.S. government will spend roughly 10 times as much money this year on AIDS research  --  $1.1 billion  --  as it does on breast cancer , even though breast cancer has claimed roughly six times as many lives in the last decade . <p> ' High priority ' : Federal health officials counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AIDS is an infectious disease whose incidence is exploding and whose toll may well dwarf that of breast cancer in coming years . Experts at the National Institutes of Health also insist that breast-cancer research is being aggressively pursued . Last year it accounted for $77 million of the National Cancer Institute 's $1.6 billion budget  --  more than lung cancer , more than colon cancer , and far more than prostate cancer , which may afflict all men if they live long enough . Says NCI chief Dr. Samuel Broder : " The entire topic of cancer in women is high priority , and always has been . " <p> To many women , however , breast cancer is every bit as frightening as AIDS . Gays and heterosexuals can substantially reduce their risk of AIDS by practicing safe sex and avoiding intravenous drugs . Despite decades of research , experts still do n't know why breast cancer occurs or how to prevent it , and they have only a vague idea of who is most at risk ( following story ) . Some factors  --  such as family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in life or not at all-seem to increase a woman 's risk of breast cancer . But most of these are beyond a woman 's power to control . And 55 percent of victims have no known risk factors in their backgrounds . " They say all you can do is emphasize early detection and watch your diet , " says Barbara Balaban of the Oncology Support Program at Adelphi School of Social Work in New York . " Try telling that to a skinny 23-year-old patient who runs every day and has no family history of breast cancer . " <p> In the face of such uncertainties , it 's not surprising that women are becoming militant . Rather than begrudge AIDS its funding , they are adopting the tactics of AIDS activists  --  pressuring lawmakers , holding demonstrations and developing underground information networks on experimental treatments and clinical trials . When Elenore Pred founded the Breast Cancer Action group in San Francisco last July , she contacted the editor of AIDS Treatment News for a course in his techniques . " I learned we have to question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancer Society , " she says . In Cambridge , Mass. , the Women 's Community Cancer Project provides psychological support for patients and demonstrates at medical meetings . " People do n't know how bad things are , " says member Ellen Crowley Overlan . Y-ME , a 12-year-old Illinois-based support group with eight chapters nationwide , is also getting political : leaders plan to use their newsletter to alert members to upcoming legislation and establish a national phone network to inundate lawmakers with calls . <p> Such efforts are paying political dividends in Congress and state houses . Three years ago , when volunteer lobbyists from the Susan Komen Foundation for breast cancer in Dallas decided to press the Texas Legislature for a bill mandating insurance coverage for base-line ( first-time ) mammography for any woman over 35 , " people almost laughed us out of Austin , " says foundation president Linda Cadigan . " But we got it through in one session . " Thirty-three states now require insurance companies to cover base-line mammographies , though the ages for the tests vary . This year , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every two years for women over 65 , as well as a $30 million screening program for poor women in four states . <p> No follow-up : To date , poor women have benefited the least from early detection . While breast-cancer death rates for white women have remained virtually unchanged in the 1980s , the rate for black women has increased 14 percent . Some 70 percent have never had a mammogram . New York City comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman was stunned to learn that most of the city 's public hospitals provide no mammogram screening for their patients , that a third of those diagnosed with breast cancer received no follow-up treatment and that death rates in such facilities are more than 70 percent  --  nearly three times the national average . " It 's a horrifying indication of what priorities are for breast cancer , " she says . <p> In fact , mammography rates could be better for women in all income groups . According to one recent study , the number of women over 40 who have had at least one mammogram has risen sharply , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only 31 percent of U.S. women are following official recommendations to be rechecked every one or two years after that . Part of the fault lies with doctors : almost half the women who have never had a mammogram said their physicians never recommended one . <p> Even when women do have mammograms , the results may not be reliable . The number of mammography machines in the United States has mushroomed from 184 in 1982 to an estimated 10,000 this year , and there are growing concerns about false positives and , worse , false negatives . " A mammogram is only as good as the person performing the test or reading the result , " says Santa Monica gynecologist Dr. Robert Friedland . To date , less than a third of the facilities have been certified by the American College of Radiology , and there are no federal standards about who can set up shop . Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland hopes to remedy that next year with a bill to require federal standards and monitoring . <p> ' Pentagon hammers ' : Rep. Mary Rose Oakar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plans to reintroduce a bill for a $25 million annual increase in the NCI 's research budget for breast and cervical cancer . " A couple of hundred million sounds like a lot . But it 's just the cost overrun of hammers or toilet seats for the Pen- tagon , " she says . Activists want the federal health bureaucracy to devote more attention to investigating the underlying causes of . breast cancer . To date , a paltry $17 million is earmarked annually for that purpose . <p> In particular , outside advocates have been pushing NCI to conduct a major study on the role of dietary fat in breast cancers , since the rates are so much lower in parts of the world , like China and Japan , where diets are low in fat . One proposed $106 million study involving 24,000 women over 15 years has been on the drawing boards for nearly a decade . Many cancer experts have opposed it , arguing that it is too expensive and impractical : it would require more than 10,000 women in the test group to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless if the control group inadvertently reduced its fat intake as well . Despite such objections , pressure by the National Women 's Health Network this year has helped to resurrect the study , though it awaits final scrutiny by the National Cancer Advisory Board . <p> Meanwhile , a growing number of breast-cancer patients are finding themselves in court , battling for insurance coverage of a promising new treatment known as autolo-gous bone-marrow transplant ( ABMT ) . The procedure , in which doctors remove some of the patient 's bone marrow , then administer extremely high doses of chemotherapy , and later reinject the marrow , has shown remarkable success . More than 30 percent of women with late-stage breast cancer are alive and disease-free up to two years after ABMT , compared with only 5 percent on standard chemotherapy . But ABMT costs up to $150,000 , and insurersoften refuse to pay on the ground that it is still " experimental . " This leaves patients in a double agony : they must endure a horrendous treatment , and , as Doreen Yip Hackett , a 38-year-old ABMT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying about how you 're going to pay for it . " <p> Insurers have long approved ABMT in cases of leukemia and lymphoma , and plaintiffs ' lawyers charge that they are balking only because the universe of potential breast-cancer patients is so much larger . " This is about money , " says attorney Richard Carter of Alexandria , Va . " It 's such an outrage . " After judges sided with the patients in several states , Blue Cross/ Blue Shield recently agreed to pay millions of dollars to support an NCI study evaluating ABMT 's effectiveness . <p> Patients ' attorney Eleanor Acheson agrees that courts are not the place to evaluate breast-cancer treatments . " This is no way to have a reasonable , rational , health-care policy , " she says . " This is n't Blue Cross 's problem . This is a real , screaming national problem . " Women dying of breast cancer should certainly not have to spend their last precious months in court , or on picket lines . But for victim Ellen Overlan , it beats giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " You can bear the surgery . What 's unbearable is the fact that this disease is going to get you and kill you .
