While upscale foodies have been proudly learning the gastronomic alphabet ( A is for arugula , B for balsamic vinegar and C for imported chevre ) , mainstream America has been mounting a kitchen counterrevolution by mastering new cooking techniques like zapping and nuking . With microwave ovens now installed in three-quarters of the nation 's kitchens , the U.S. is in the midst of a food upheaval that may leave taste buds as imperiled as the Panamanian drug trade . <P> The microwave oven is not to blame : it is not machines that kill taste but the people who use them . What is destroying American cuisine is the growing fetish for cooking entire dinners during the commercial breaks on Wheel of Fortune and Family Feud . " Unlike in Europe , where someone might savor the experience of food , " says Joel Weiner , the former executive vice president of Kraft , " Americans have gone the other way in a rapid-fire , lowest-common- denominator world . " <P> Make no mistake , America has not yet reached that degraded state where most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation of harried two-income families , where meals are primarily an opportunity for refueling , it is hard to dismiss market researcher Faith Popcorn 's bold prediction that " there are n't going to be stoves very soon . " Others forecast that by 1995 half of all American kitchens will play home on the range with two microwaves . A Wall Street Journal survey found that 75% of Americans believe the microwave oven has made " life a lot better . " Consumer demand is so keen that the food industry is racing to catch the microwave . Packaged products primarily designed to be hyperheated in these kitchen reactors have exploded into a more than $2 billion-a-year industry . To distinguish old-line cooking from microwave preparation , food-marketing experts are actually beginning to use " stovetop " as a verb ( as in " Most Americans still stovetop dinner " ) . <P> There are , of course , food purists who treat the microwave with the disdain once reserved for Cheez Whiz  --  a product , incidentally , that is undergoing a dramatic resurrection because it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wonderful invention " before adding with a sniff , " I do n't go in for it myself . I like regular cooking . I like to smell the food , poke it and look at it . " <P> Still , there is a grudging consensus that the microwave prepares certain foods , like fresh vegetables , very well indeed . Roger Berkowitz , co-owner of the highly regarded Legal Sea Foods restaurants in the Boston area , has become a convert to microwaving shrimp and lobsters at home , though he warns that " you have about ten seconds to leave the room , or you see their claws hit the oven window . " Both microwave-oven size and New England tradition militate against applying this technique in his restaurants . As Berkowitz puts it , " How do you tell someone , ' I just nuked your lobster ' ? " <P> Cookbook-author Barbara Kafka ( Microwave Gourmet ) has quieted many culinary Luddites with dishes like her almost effortless microwave risotto . A sampled batch was creamy , a bit chewy and nearly identical to risotto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonstop , laborious stirring . " Microwaves do n't cook everything well , " Kafka cautions . " Manufacturers originally claimed that they were a magic pill that could do anything . They can  --  badly . "
