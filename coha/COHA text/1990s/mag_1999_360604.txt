Parenthood did not come easily to Kevin and Kim Knussman . First there was a painful year of fertility treatments . Then complications in Kim 's pregnancy forced her doctors to induce labor prematurely , leaving her bedridden . Kevin , a trooper with the Maryland state police for 18 years , applied for extended leave to tend to his wife and infant , a request that fell under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and a state law that provides paid leave for primary caregivers . He was allotted just 10 days , at the end of which his wife was still hemorrhaging and too weak to care for the baby . He asked for more time , but claims that the personnel manager responded , " Unless your wife is in a coma or dead , you ca n't be primary care provider . " <P> When Kevin went back to work , he filed a complaint that he had been denied the leave solely because of his gender . Then he sought help from the American Civil Liberties Union , which sued the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin , awarding him $375,000 in the first-ever sex-discrimination case brought under the federal act . The state argued that Kevin did not alert the right people to his wife 's condition and failed to prove that he was the primary care provider . " It was never a gender-based issue , " says Maryland assistant attorney general Betty Stemley Sconion , who may appeal the verdict . <P> The long legal fight has turned Kevin into a poster dad for the Family and Medical Leave Act , now six years old . Though about 2 million people a year take parental leave under the act , only half a million of them are men . Kevin is working to even the scales . He has testified before a federal commission and even got a mention in Hillary Rodham Clinton 's book It Takes a Village . But the biggest changes are back home . When he and his wife had their second child , in 1996 , Kevin was granted a full 12 weeks of paid leave . " It 's such a precious thing to hold that little life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost that the first time . " <P>  --  By Jodie Morse
