<p> U.S. needs moderation <p> I was pleased to read the details of the administration 's balanced budget proposal ( Chronicle , Jan. 7 ) . <p> You are to be commended for your unbiased reporting . <p> President Clinton proposed a balanced budget . It cuts taxes by $ 87 billion over seven years . It cuts Medicare by $ 102 billion and Medicaid by $ 52 billion . It cuts $ 295 billion from several other government programs . It provides for $ 194 billion in new spending . It proves that the budget can be balanced in seven years without sacrificing a lot of our education and environmental programs and without hurting the elderly and the poor . <p> Newly elected Republican congressmen have purposely shut our government down twice , and they threaten to shut it down again if they do not get their destructive , seven-year balanced budget approved by our president . <p> These congressmen disregard our nation 's basic precepts . The judicial branch oversees legality . The congressional branch formulates and passes legislation . The president either approves or vetoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overridden by a two-thirds majority congressional vote . Shutting down the government rather than formulating different approvable legislation borders on fanaticism . <p> This extremism that has plagued our nation is not the Eisenhower , Nixon , Ford or Bush legacy . We are plagued with the Goldwater , Reagan and Gingrich ilk . <p> This extremism does n't " " give a hoot or a damn " for our country ; all that counts is legislation favorable to special interests . <p> America needs moderation . It 's easy for political extremists to continually criticize and hold stubbornly to unreasonable positions . But extremism will not get the budget balanced . <p> Moderation will , because moderates talk , assess , debate , listen , decide and , yes , lead . <p> Denis E. Bergeron , Friendswood <p> Extremely interesting <p> I find it extremely interesting that the people who want the federal government to get off their backs are now asking for money and help from that same " " repressive " government because of the snow storm . <p> Kenneth L. Russell , Huntsville <p> Very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his legal bills and said if he and Hillary compared their assets with their liabilities , likely their net worth would be close to zero . <p> Without regard to their economic status , this coincides with my appraisal of them since I heard about Whitewatergate , Cattlegate and Bill 's bimbo problems . <p> Ford A. Bankston , Houston <p> Could have been spared <p> I agree with Gayle Harris Birk when she stated , " " The Whitewater investigation has reached ridiculous proportions " ( Viewpoints , Jan.10 ) . <p> If Hillary and the Clinton aides had cooperated with the investigation at its onset instead of prolonging it by practicing sloppy recordkeeping of critical and possibly incriminating documents , the administration could have spared us two years of taxpayers ' money spent on a lengthy investigation . <p> And even if the alleged criminal activities under investigation " " occurred many years ago when President Clinton was governor of Arkansas , " would not a similar code of ethics apply to elected officials of a state that apply to elected officials of a federal office ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this does n't guarantee her honesty . If Hillary had been truly brilliant , she would have pretended to " " put her brain in neutral , cook , clean and raise the children . " This would have pulled the wool over the eyes of the otherwise threatened " " good-old-boys " who have been out to get her from the start . <p> And since these boys would have no one to pick on , any of Hillary 's possible misdeeds could have gone unnoticed . But then , this behavior would make Hillary appear too domestic and she would no longer be worthy of Birk 's hero standards . I bet Bill wishes that Hillary had only been " " seen and not heard . " <p> Laura Hilsmeier , Houston <p> Nothing substantial <p> I find Peter J. Riga 's dittohead Republican Party line assertions offensive ( " " Lies will destroy liars , " Viewpoints , Jan. 13 ) . <p> The problem the dittoheads have is discovering something substantial to investigate since all the facts create dry holes . All they have left is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , inferred or thought was seemingly improper . <p> Of course , this scrutiny is much more important than the many other problems this country faces . <p> J. D. Hughes , Houston <p> Get with it , or be left <p> When I was very young , we had no phone numbers . We picked up the phone and waited for an operator . <p> When she ( it was always a " " she " ) answered , we told her to whom we wished to speak and she connected us . Then came dial service and everyone was assigned a four-digit number . <p> Exchanges followed . We still dialed the same four-digit number , but to call someone outside our exchange , we had to dial it , too . My grandparents were in the Lehigh exchange , so we dialed L ( Lehigh ) - XXXX . Later , Lehigh became LE4-XXXX . Up until that time , all long distance calls went through the operator . <p> Progress ! Direct long-distance dialing became a reality and we learned to use area codes . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call dialing . So what else is new ? I 'm sorry the boomers and " " X-ers " are n't handling it so well . Tell them to " " get with it , " or the world will go off and leave them . <p> George A. " " Slim " Jones , Fresno <p> Leon Hale made her day <p> Leon Hale 's Jan. 9 column , " " Lots to forget about getting old , " made me feel great . I am not the only senior citizen with the same kinds of problems about forgetfulness and losing things . <p> Thanks Leon , you made my day . <p> Katherine Colley , College Station <p> There is a connection <p> Regarding Benedict F. Giamo 's Jan. 7 Outlook article , " " Quit blaming those least able to make it on own " : <p> Giamo compares the gap between rich and poor in the United States and Japan , indicating that the United States has the biggest gap and Japan the smallest . <p> He did not compare the number of uneducated illegal immigrants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneducated unwed teen-age mothers in the two countries . I believe there is a connection between these numbers and the gap between rich and poor . <p> Lisa Lee , League City <p> They 'd sacrifice it all <p> The Jan. 9 editorial , " " Unbalanced , " concerning the Medical Transformation Act requirement of families to pay part of their parents ' medical or nursing home requirement - even if it takes from the savings and druthers of these offsprings - misses an important point . <p> In my world , it would not take long to call the roll of those parents who would not give up everything to care for one of their children , regardless of that person 's age . <p> William H. Knotts Jr. , Huntsville <p> Stifling honest debate <p> Regarding Editorial board member James T. Campbell 's Jan. 15 Sounding Board column , " " Houston smart not to follow others ' lead " : <p> What makes words such as " " quotas , " " " reverse discrimination " and " " preferential treatment " racially coded words ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called racist by you people in the media ( including Campbell ) instead of discussing the validity of his argument . <p> This only serves to stifle the honest discussion of the issues . <p> Meanwhile , a black separatist can have a " " Million Man March " and the media act as his public-relations wing , not calling him what he is : a racist , black separatist . This allows certain groups to practice their hatred with immunity from embarrassment while others are called racist , whether or not they really are racist . <p> John Harris , Houston <p> TYPE : Letters
