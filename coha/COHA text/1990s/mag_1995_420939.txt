" To cultural exchange " Misha , the failed Russian soft-core pornographer , raised his vodka glass yet again . I feared this was a reference to the Kiev Project . It was cabaret night at the Cafe Arbat in the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn , and Misha and I had been locked in a duel of toasts for several hours : to each other 's health , to long life , to the future of Russian democracy , but mostly to the various joint business ventures that Misha was convinced we were soon to embark upon . Although I had been studiously noncommittal about his other schemes  --  starting a marriage-brokering service that would match beautiful Russian girls with American dentists , obtaining U.S. licensing rights to the miracle male-sexual-potency drug secretly being developed by a team of German scientists  --  I had been unable to mask my curiosity about the Kiev Project . After all , it is not often that one is invited to organize an international goodwill tour for a troupe of Ukrainian exotic dancers . " The best dancers in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all personally . I am organizing them in Kiev , you are fund-raising here in America-maybe your magazine bosses are contributing-and we will be having very good cultural exchange . " " Cultural exchange , " I had come to realize over the course of our acquaintance , was a complex term in Misha 's lexicon , elastic enough to encompass , simultaneously , making money , committing fraud , and having sex . Quite aside from the Kiev Project and the vodka , however , cabaret night with Misha had begun to go badly awry . During the last band break , the middle-aged " entrepreneur " ( " always I am thinking how to involve myself in free-market ideas " ) had waved over Anna , a cabaret singer wearing a tight sequined dress and an extravagant red wig , and introduced me as a wealthy and important American journalist . These oxymorons clearly did n't translate in Russian , for Anna had been dedicating songs to me ever since , casting pouty smiles in my direction during the accordion player 's extended riffs . These affectionate displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on my left ; interspersed with dark mutterings to his companion , he had taken to glaring at me and ostentatiously rolling his head , like a boxer about to step into the ring . The outlook was little better on my right , where a party of perhaps two dozen Russian Jews were becoming increasingly vexed by the anti-Semitic remarks that Misha  --  Jewish himself  --  had taken to proclaiming loudly whenever the tension elsewhere seemed to flag . Nor did I have much confidence that any one in the Cafe Arbat would come to my aid if things got ugly , for I remembered what had happened to Oleg Korataev . In January 1994 , Korataev , a former boxer and a reputed enforcer for the Russian mafia in Brighton Beach , was celebrating Russian New Year in the Arbat when he stepped outside with a companion . When Korataev looked away for a moment , his companion shot him in the back of the head with a .38 , then left his body on the sidewalk and returned to the nightclub to resume the festivities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one who could identify the killer . In short , it seemed like a good idea to wrap things up with Misha and get to the point of our meeting . I asked if he had learned anything new about Yaponchik . " Of course , " Misha said . " All the time I am making more and more progress on the Yaponchik Project . " Yaponchik  --  " Little Japanese " in Russian  --  was the nickname of Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov , one of the most infamous godfathers of the Russian underworld . Rumor had it he was in New York to unite the Russian emigre mafias . For months , I had heard Ivankov 's name darkly muttered by law enforcement officers and Brighton Beach residents , and had collected news articles alluding to his exploits . Misha filled our vodka glasses once more . " Yes , very soon we will be meeting with Yaponchik . It might be expensive , naturally . " " How expensive " Misha shrugged . " Impossible to say . " With a pleased smile , he raised his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one more maddening episode in my long search for Little Japanese . At the outset , it had seemed straightforward enough , a classic gangster-story assignment : meet the godfather , talk to his law enforcement adversaries , chronicle his crimes . Instead , Yaponchik had become a journalist 's worst nightmare , an enigma always beyond my grasp , a figure of legend , the protagonist of a dozen whispered  --  and unprovable  --  stories . It would be many months after that meeting with Misha before I finally understood why . In my hunt for Yaponchik , I would come to realize , I had left the underworld as I knew it and entered a far more mysterious place , a shadow world where gangsters , cops , and journalists maneuver and manipulate one another in a volatile game of bluff and intrigue . It is a game in which fortunes and reputations are made , in which the line between enemy and ally shifts constantly , in which the stakes grow ever higher . For a while Yaponchik played this game and played it very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , I have been fascinated with gangsters . Not run-of-the-mill criminals but those of a refined darkness : outlaws with panache , a taste for the high life , snappy nicknames . Through both chance and design , I 've come to know quite a few such men over the years , often in odd corners of the globe . My proclivity first found expression at the age of fourteen , when , left virtually unsupervised in Bangkok for two months , I fell in with a group of young Chinese vice lords in the Patpong red-light district . It was n't that I wanted to become one of them exactly , but there was something undeniably thrilling about being in their company  --  the deferent looks we engendered walking down a street , the ripple of consternation that accompanied our entrance into a nightclub , the cryptic and whispered conversations with bar girls and bouncers and nattily dressed confederates  --  and it would be many years before I fully grasped the depths of moral bankruptcy to which I had been subjected . By then it was too late ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . One evening in West Beirut , during the bloody summer of 1983 , I found myself on the balcony of a penthouse with a middle-aged Druze named Suheih , a war profiteer in a white linen suit , watching artillery shells fall on the city from the eastern foothills . Oblivious to the shells and sporadic sniper fire , Suheih leaned against the railing , eating pistachio nuts and noting which neighborhoods were being hardest hit , already speculating about which commodity would be the most lucrative to deliver across the battle lines the next day : penicillin , bottled water , even body-sniffing dogs brought in from Europe . " Times of difficulty are also times of opportunity , " he explained . Over the years , my circle of gangster acquaintances expanded  --  aging mafiosi in Nevada , paramilitary warlords in Belfast , a smuggling patron in northern Mexico  --  enough for me to gradually notice a remarkable sameness among them . No matter what their age or ethnicity or criminal specialty , all gangsters seemed to possess the same essential outlook on life  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the same basic public persona : a dead-fish stare ; a haughty , contemptuous manner ; a predatory aura that tended to keep " civilians " out of their way . It was these universal signs of the underworld that first led me to notice the two Russian gangsters on the F train out of Manhattan . The men were in their early thirties , pokerfaced , their powerful builds cloaked in expensive fur coats . They stood with arms crossed , their backs against a closed subway door , and carried on an intermittent sideways conversation in Russian while methodically sizing up everyone who entered their immediate orbit . It was n't these details that tipped me off  --  hyper-vigilance , after all , is a common phenomenon on the New York City subways  --  but the requisite touches of underworld dandyism : permed hair , gold chains visible past the fur collars , the profligate use of cheap aftershave . Russians were not an unusual sight on the Brooklyn-bound F train . The line ends at Coney Island , adjacent to the waterfront community of Brighton Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in this area-primarily Jewish refugees in the early days , but increasingly a polyglot of other ethnic groups from the former Soviet Union  --  making it the largest Russian emigre neighborhood in the Western Hemisphere and earning it the nickname " Little Odessa . " I had chanced upon the ebb and flow of this community at various times on the F train  --  the middle-aged women going to their early morning janitorial jobs in Manhattan , a few hours later the carefully groomed secretaries with their romance novels and Reeboks , in the evening the Orthodox Jews in their long black coats and fedoras returning from the garment and jewelry districts . The gangsters , however , were something new , and after that first sighting I began to see more and more of them . My curiosity was piqued ; in the summer of 1994 , I decided to explore their world . Just in time too . From the sound of it , the Russians were taking over American organized crime . In magazines and newspapers across the United States , there had been an explosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing prostitution rings and protection rackets , hiring themselves out on murder-for-hire schemes , collaborating with the more venerable Cosa Nostra to make inroads into the heroin trade . Most terrifying of all were reports that they were in the RD phase of an international black market in nuclear material , stolen from the fire-sale emporium that the Soviet Union had become . The American headquarters for this Organizatsiya , journalists and law enforcement officers seemed to agree , was Brighton Beach . The specter of nuclear holocaust notwithstanding , the rise of the Brighton Beach godfathers appeared to be a fairly typical immigrant success story , one previously played out by the Italians , the Irish , the Chinese , and a half-dozen other ethnic groups that had settled in enclaves in America 's larger cities . In the early days of Little Odessa , the Brighton Beach criminals had been two-bit thugs largely preying on their own , running numbers rackets , pyramid schemes , and loan-sharking operations . No one took much notice until Marat Balagula , the owner of the Odessa Restaurant in Brighton Beach , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . In the mid-1980s , Balagula teamed up with members of various Cosa Nostra crime families to pull off an elaborate gasoline distribution scheme that cost the government over $42 million a year in lost tax revenue . When Balagula was finally locked up in 1989 , Russian crime figures had already been introduced to the world of high finance and " real " mafiosi . The collapse of the Soviet Union and a second wave of Russian emigration to the United States in the early 1990s made the situation even worse . Whereas the early emigres had been primarily Jews granted political asylum , now virtually anyone could obtain a Russian exit visa and slip into the counting as a tourist ; along with tens of thousands of bona fide refugees came an estimated 2,000 convicted criminals . Although Marat Balagula was out of the picture , it appeared that there was now a small army of excellent students to take his place . " Spreading out from their base in Brighton Beach , " Robert Friedman wrote in the January 1993 issue Vanity Fair , " the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Medicare fraud , in American history , with a net haul exceeding $1 billion . They are importing heroin into the U.S. from Southeast Asia as well as from poppy fields around Chernobyl .... Through their control of gasoline terminals and distributorships in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere . Russian mobsters evade as much as $5 billion a year in state and federal taxes , a portion of which goes as tribute to the Italian Mafia . " Other journalists painted an equally ominous picture . " More and more Russian Mafiosi and their hired thugs are pouring into the United States , " reported Andrew Meier in Image magazine in December 1993 , " and expanding their murderous network into new markets at a rapid clip . " The statements of American law enforcement officials involved in tracking the Russian gangsters were even more alarming . " The Russian criminals are networking and developing much faster than any group I 've seen in the United States , " Jim Moody , the head of the FBI 's organized crime section , announced at a Moscow news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now that they can get to the U.S. more easily , they 've hit the ground running . " " You better believe the hype , " an investigator for California 's Soviet Organized Crime Intelligence Team had told Meier . " The Russians are n't coming anymore . They 're here . " In meeting this new threat , the American government had gone " proactive . " In January 1994 , the Justice Department announced that it was placing the Russian mafia on the highest investigative priority status , on the same level as the Cosa Nostra and the Colombian cocaine cartels . The FBI opened a Moscow liaison office and formed specialized Russian Organized Crime ( ROC ) squads in New York and Los Angeles , complementing the new Russian-crime task forces being hastily established by a half-dozen state and local governments . A U.S. Senate subcommittee heard frightening testimony from a parade of experts on the growing power of the Russian crime syndicates . For a bit of guidance on finding my own niche in all this , I sought out one of the preeminent authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue in Manhattan , Alexandre Grant , news editor of Novoye Russkoye Slovo , the largest Russian-language newspaper in the United States , has had a bird's-eye view of the changing face of Brighton Beach . His newspaper has played a peripheral role in the underworld struggles being waged there : Brighton Beach con artists have used the NRS classifieds to advertise their scams , the FBI periodically buys space to run Russian-language appeals for information about the mafia , and its obituary page is frequently the first official notice that a new gangland rubout has taken place . " You have to look at the language the family puts in , " the genial , middle-aged editor explained . " If you see that a thirty-five-year-old man is dead , and they say he " tragically died " during the night , you know he was murdered . " Grant chuckled . " ' Tragically died . " Everyone in Brighton Beach knows what this means . " At one time , Grant told me , there had been an element of cooperation among the godfathers , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants . " Now no one trusts anyone else . The whole order has fallen down because there is no incentive to cooperate . If you want to kill a rival , all you have to do now is hire someone to come over from Moscow . For $2,000 , they will fly in , do the job , then fly out again , and no one knows who they are . The situation is very fluid and very dangerous right now . " Grant brought out a folder of news clippings and 8 x 10 black-and-white photos , his chronicle of the rise and fall of a score of Brighton Beach thugs . In some of the photos , sullen men glowered into the camera  --  mug shots of still-active players  --  while photos showing smiling , relaxed men tended to mark those who had gone by the wayside , studio portraits selected by families to run on the NRS obituary page . One photograph caught my attention . It was of a stern-faced , bearded man in his forties , with a strong jaw and prominent nose , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most arresting feature . Beneath extremely thin eyebrows , they sloped dramatically downward . I was reminded of paintings of Genghis Khan . " Yaponchik , " Grant said . " His real name is Vyacheslav Ivankov , but everyone calls him Yaponchik  --  Little Japanese  --  because he looks Oriental . They say he is trying to organize the Brighton Beach mafias into one syndicate . " Grant dug through his sheaf of news clippings and handed me an AP news article from December 1993 : " Moscow Underworld Boss Puts Down New Roots  --  In Brooklyn . " It seemed that with Little Japanese I had lucked into a key functionary in the Organizatsiya hierarchy . Arrested for robbery and sentenced in 1982 to fourteen years in a Siberian prison , the AP article explained , Ivankov had built a personal power base there and become a vory v zakone ( thief in law ) , " an obscure old Russian term for a ceremonially installed criminal leader who decided disputes and divided spoils according to the thieves ' " law . " Released in 1991 , Ivankov somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he then settled in Brighton Beach-a source of great concern to police on both sides of the Atlantic . " Dozens of " thieves in law " run gangs across Russia , " the AP reported , " but Yaponchik ... has stood out among them . A leader of his stature controls a large region and possibly thousands of criminals through a dozen or so underbosses , Russian police say . " A weird nickname , a face out of Central Casting , a mysterious honorific , and a grand evil scheme to boot  --  Yaponchik had it all . When I asked Grant how to find him , however , the editor sighed . " He will not talk . I have tried , but he 's always refused to say anything to the press . He 's still pulling the triggers and at the levers , and the criminal law of the vory v zakone is to have no contact with the press . When he retires , maybe , but not now . " But Grant could see that his cautions were lost on me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he offered . " A lot of people say they have seen him walking on the boardwalk . If you want to find him , go to Brighton Beach . " Misha , drinking copious amounts of medicinal tea to ward off a suspected flu , began to complain bitterly about his lot in life within minutes of our first meeting at his Brighton Beach apartment . " Always I am being cheated and taken advantage of , " he said , holding a tissue to his nose . " And now it is affecting my health ... " Although Misha had a list of betrayals and failed business enterprises dating back years , his chief complaint at the moment was the sorry fate of his last project : an hour-long " documentary " on the changing role of women in post-Communist Russia and Ukraine . Having found investors to fund his research , Misha had been unable to sell the finished product . " And now the investors are upset with me , " Misha said , inserting the video into his VCR . I saw the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of young women in varying stages of undress , dancing and exercising to industrial disco music  --  displayed a certain exuberance , there appeared to have been a breakdown in production values : poor lighting , a jerky and unfocused camera . I also suspected that there might be some legal complications with the segment showing a group of underage schoolgirls lined up in a Kiev plaza , all fully clothed but eating bananas for the camera . " So you see , " Misha said , turning off the video , " there are very many businesses we can be doing together  --  films , books , so many cultural-exchange businesses . " For some reason , Misha had decided that a new economic alliance had been forged the moment I knocked on his apartment door . Capitalism had seized his mind and found there a particularly fecund garden , and the only thing to be decided was which commodity from his homeland we would peddle : medical cures , real estate , precious metals , girls ; the entire country was on the auction block , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever I reminded him of the comparatively narrow scope of my journalistic interests , he would nod and smile slyly , as if this were a fiction he would uphold for as long as I saw the need to maintain it . Finally , I steered the conversation to Ivankov , asked Misha if he knew how I might meet him . " You mean the godfather Yaponchik ? " He seemed momentarily alarmed , but then shrugged nonchalantly . " Yes , it is no problem to find him . We can be doing very many projects together on Yaponchik . " I decided to keep it vague . Misha would arrange a meeting with Ivankov ; after that , I lied , I would give careful consideration to his various joint-venture ideas . In the meantime , I set out to explore Brighton Beach . I usually began these explorations by taking the F train out to Coney Island and cutting through the seedy amusement park , past the forlorn-looking rides and roustabouts , to the boardwalk . Walking east along the shore , I would come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples dissipated , a brief stretch where I had the boardwalk almost to myself , before reaching the edge of Brighton Beach and the beginnings of a very different crowd : elderly Russian women packed hip-to-hip on benches , wearing scarves and long dresses even at the zenith of summer , knots of men hunched over card tables and domino games , a sudden profusion of outdoor cafes with names in Cyrillic script . I arrived as a tourist , certainly , but a special sort : the tourist-journalist , the morbid voyeur drawn to the darkness of a place even on a sunny afternoon . In those early days , Brighton Beach was like a vast museum to me , the repository of a hidden history , and I came to know where a few of the more interesting artifacts were . On the corner of Sixth Street and the boardwalk , I watched as workmen put the finishing touches on Naum Raichel 's new Winter Garden Restaurant . Raichel was a Russian emigre who had gone to prison here in 1987 for extortion . Through the restaurant 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleated napkins sticking out of wine glasses . Just a few days earlier , on the night of July 11 , two unknown men had confronted Raichel around the corner and fired three bullets into his chest and stomach . Up on Brighton Beach Avenue , the main commercial strip of Little Odessa , I could almost pretend I had been transported a continent away to the Russia of my imagination : the Cyrillic signs of the pastry shops and shoe stores ; the sidewalks taken over by old women selling knickknacks , matrioska dolls , and produce ; the butcher shops with their great loops of sausage in the windows . Even the elevated D train track , which cast the avenue in permanent half-light , its cars clacking and screeching overhead at regular intervals , fit my image of Russia as a drab and dreary place . But invariably I focused on the sidewalk before the Cafe Arbat , where Oleg Korataev 's body had been left , or on the stolid facade of the National Restaurant , where one morning in May 1991 a gunman stepped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandelier and the framed photographs of Jackie Mason against the brocaded wallpaper , and entered the crowded dining room to put eight bullets into Emil Puzyretsky . This particular killing had already entered the realm of local folklore ; I tended to doubt the stories about the waiter continuing to serve omelettes during the shooting but tended to believe those that told of extremely cooperative National patrons moving tables and chairs for the gunman as he scoured the carpet for his spent bullet casings . In the side streets of the community , I became familiar with a half-dozen alleys and apartment building foyers where something ugly had happened  --  a tragedy for a family , a source of rumors for the neighbors , but for me one more anecdote in an observer 's diary , another glimpse into the brutal and exotic world I was studying as if it were under glass . There was an element of distraction to these tours , for out of the corner of my eye I was always looking for someone . Among the domino players and boardwalk strollers but also in the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectral image of Little Japanese . Toward this end , I checked in with Misha periodically . " Our good fortune continues , " he would announce . " There is no longer any question  --  a few last arrangements to be made and we are meeting Yaponchik . " Although reassuring at first , Misha 's grand pronouncements  --  our breathtaking march of progress , the unbroken string of great strides forward , but always just one or two more unforeseen complications  --  began to remind me of an old Soviet Five Year Plan . It did n't help that others seemed to be bumping into Little Japanese with some regularity . Ivankov , the New York Times reported that August , " has been seen strolling on Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay , Brooklyn , and dining at the Rasputin , a nightclub in Brighton Beach , and at the Russian Samovar , a midtown Manhattan restaurant . " I was also becoming troubled by Misha 's offhand but persistent suggestion that the ultimate success of " our Yaponchik project " would probably require an outlay of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was met with a flippant wave from Misha  --  " impossible to say at this point "  --  before he swerved the conversation toward his newest roster of business proposals . There was something about importing pornographic Japanese comic books to the Crimea , something else about buying the deed to a copper mine in Kazakhstan . " No need to make an agreement tonight , " he would say at the end of these sales pitches , usually while raising a vodka glass in toast . " You are probably wanting to discuss these attractive offers with your magazine bosses . " Gradually I began to meet other raffish elements of the community , a succession of young men  --  most with crew cuts and tattooed biceps  --  who also offered to act as my guide through the Brighton Beach underworld . These prospective guides were expansive in discussing the past deeds of the Organizatsiya  --  or , at least , in recycling the old rumors  --  but chary when it came to describing the current scene . I also noticed in them a mirroring of Misha 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief moment of consternation , a thoughtful gazing into space , and then the casual , confident shrug  --  " Yes , it is no problem ; I can take you to Yaponchik . " Always underlying these offers was the tacit understanding that such an endeavor would require money  --  possibly a very considerable sum of money  --  but , as with Misha , none of my newfound friends wished to sully our relationship with details . As with any foreign culture , the longer I stared at the Brighton Beach underworld , the more opaque it became . Beyond the folklore and sensational newspaper accounts  --  and the dramatic re-enactments in my own imagination  --  many of the killings that had occurred there began to take on a decidedly small-time quality the more I investigated them : a falling-out among petty thieves , a bar fight gone bad . And while the body count might have been alarming to someone in Iowa , say , it hardly constituted an epidemic by New York City standards . What 's more , if there was any signature to a Brighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak of incompetence . Victims had a way of lingering on in hospital beds for days  --  or not dying at all . Where in all of this , I began to wonder , was the smooth hand of a professional Organizatsiya ? And then there was the riddle of Yaponchik . If the authorities knew Ivankov was in New York , why was he being allowed to operate with such impunity ? Why , with so many sightings of him in the nightclubs and on the boulevards of New York  --  sightings of such frequency that at times it seemed the man had cloned himself  --  were the authorities never able to find him ? " Because no one 's looking for him , " Peter Grinenko said . " He 's not wanted for anything . All Ivankov 's doing is working a hustle , and he 's not going to get busted for that , because everyone wants to believe it . You want me to tell you about Ivankov and the Organizatsiya ? Okay , I 'll tell you : it 's all bullshit . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his massive barrel chest and small angry eyes , he looked a lot like a mafioso himself . Except that Grinenko , a native Russian speaker , had been a New York City detective for twenty-three years and was now a part-time investigator for the Brooklyn district attorney , specializing in Russian crime cases . He was also something of a pariah on the Russian emigre crime-fighting circuit . It was easy to see why : within moments of our first meeting , he had launched into an angry diatribe  --  liberally scattered with scatological references  --  on various state and local law enforcement agencies , whole branches of the federal government , journalists in general . " What you 've got in Brighton Beach , " Grinenko said , " are a bunch of two-bit hustlers . You 've got junkies ripping each other off , you 've got a few punks fighting over their little rackets , and you 've got a whole mess of people  --  old ladies , doctors , housewives  --  ripping off the state . This is organized crime ? " As one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police force , Grinenko started getting pulled onto Brighton Beach duty with the first wave of Soviet emigration in the late 1970s . Over the years , he has been at least peripherally involved in nearly every major law enforcement operation launched in the emigre community . " And after every operation , " he said , " I look at what the newspapers say and I ca n't recognize it . Two fuck-ups get arrested at JFK with a couple of kilos of heroin , and suddenly everyone 's talking about how the Russians are setting up the next Cali cartel . Last year , a dozen guys get busted with some illegal slot machines , and it 's " the Russian mafia is taking over the gambling industry . ' ' " Grinenko held up a finger a few inches from my face . " Now , there 's one kind of crime that the Russkies are very good at , better than anyone else in the world : fraud . And that 's what Ivankov is . " He chuckled derisively . " Let me tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grinenko said , stole a car in 1980 and tried to extort ransom for it . " When he went to collect , he was busted . That was Ivankov 's big crime . This guy is a mafia godfather ? Forget about it . " After that meeting with Grinenko , I went back to my collection of Brighton Beach articles , to the ones I had glided over before , the small , insignificant items tucked away in the back pages of newspaper Metro sections . There was the occasional robbery and auto theft , of course , but . what emerged was a consistent and overwhelming pattern of fraud . Sophia Perett , director of the nonprofit Center for Russian Immigrants in Brighton Beach , and her husband , Henrich Barel , arrested for fraud and trafficking in phony Social Security cards and birth certificates . Boris Bronshteyn and Vladimir Slobodsky of I &; S Surgical Supply , indicted on charges of bilking Medicaid for $727,000 worth of nonexistent orthotic back supports . Five Russian doctors  --  along with thirty-five of their patients  --  nabbed in a bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability notes to their patients , enabling them to ride the subway for half price . The continuum of fraud extended from the hapless penny-ante practitioners who had found their way onto the local police blotter even to the most celebrated of the mafiosi : Marat Balagula and his gasoline-tax fraud , the Shmushkevich brothers and their $1 billion medical-insurance swindle in California . In the Brighton Beach emigre community , I began to see , were many who had been shaped by seventy years of misrule , who had learned to lie , cheat , and steal in order to survive . I now understood Misha and his fellow Brighton Beach " tour guides " as newly hybridized men  --  half socialist , half capitalist  --  frantically seeking to find their way in a strange new world where everything was a potential commodity , everyone was a potential mark , a bountiful land that offered endless opportunity for those with the gall to exploit it . I had been just such a mark , for I had come to Brighton Beach as a buyer  --  in the market for Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informants-and they had done their best to sell me . Here , I felt , was finally the answer to the Yaponchik riddle . He had remained a legendary figure because it was lucrative to do so . With a certain smugness , I watched the Yaponchik myth continue to grow . In February 1995 , the Washington Post put his photograph on its front page and used his story to illustrate the " extraordinary growth of Russian organized crime . " The following month , CNN joined in with an alarming " Special Assignment " report on the newcomers to the American underworld , linking the Russians to " extortion , prostitution , insurance fraud , guns , heroin , money laundering , murder for hire . " At the climactic moment , the old , familiar photograph of Yaponchik filled the television screen . " From New York to Los Angeles to Miami , " the reporter intoned , " this is the man from Moscow who federal agents say has come to take control of the Russian mob : Vyacheslav Ivankov . " He was also , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Post , Ivankov was " a man who tended carefully to his appearance , favoring a dapper little kerchief tucked neatly in his suit pocket , " the master criminal who had escaped capture and prosecution with " fast cars and smart lawyers . " On CNN , the ubiquitous Alexandre Grant offered that Ivankov liked music , drank in moderation , and was " very good with girls . " And as Yaponchik 's public image grew , so did his resume ; now his biography filled out with a host of colorful  --  and often conflicting  --  new incarnations : crime boss of Vladivostok , " the father of Soviet extortion , " kingpin of all Soviet Far East Asia ; mentor to Otari Kvantrishvili , the godfather of Moscow 's Somnetskaya crime syndicate ; close personal friend and underworld confederate of Yuri Churbanov , Leonid Brezhnev 's son-in-law . " Certainly he 's the biggest Russian mafia figure that we 've seen or heard of yet here in the United States , " DEA administrator Thomas Constantine told CNN , an analysis reiterated by Alexandre Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing missing in all this was the same component that had been missing all along : hard facts . No one writing or broadcasting the Ivankov story had actually interviewed him or independently verified his criminal background . Rather , they were simply parroting the vague pronouncements of the FBI and other federal agents who , in turn , appeared to be recycling information supplied by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs , or MVD , an offshoot of the old KGB . If nothing else , this suggested a remarkable change of heart by both the American media and government in the post-Cold War era : in five years the Soviet intelligence services had gone from symbolizing all that was dark and treacherous in the Soviet Union to being trustworthy sources for both news stories and federal investigations . I made these observations with a faintly sanctimonious pleasure , rather like the man who has already been duped in a game of three-card monte shaking his head at the craven stupidity of new victims . But then something unexpected happened : Yaponchik emerged from the shadows at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its denouement in the offices of Summit International , an investment-advisory company based in New York . As with the rest of the Yaponchik story , however , there was nothing simple about the conclusion . Despite its prosperous-sounding name , Summit International was a decidedly modest operation established by two Russian emigres , Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin , who had found their market niche in servicing the flight of capital from the chaos of Russia . In November 1994 , the company officers were visited by two Moscow " businessmen , " Roustam Sadykov and Maxim Korostishevsky , who had come to collect 60 percent of a $2.7 million investment made by a third party , now deceased ; for their cooperation , Volkov and Voloshin could keep the other 40 percent and be free of any future " aggravation . " But the Summit executives balked at the offer . For the next several months , they stalled for time , enduring a series of increasingly angry and threatening calls and visits from the Russian visitors . Things turned ominous on the afternoon of February 21 . Shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Voloshin panicked and fled the Summit offices . From behind the plate-glass window of a store across the street , they watched Sadykov and Korostishevsky arrive with a man they recognized from newspaper photographs : Vyacheslav Ivankov . That was enough for the Summit executives . Fearing for their lives , they hastily packed up their families and fled to Miami . They also went to the FBI . " They were very frightened , very concerned , " recalled Raymond Kerr , the special agent in charge of the FBI 's ROC squad  --  or C-24  --  in New York . " With Ivankov appearing on the scene , they sensed they were in serious trouble . " The FBI , which had been intermittently watching Ivankov since early 1993 , now intensified their effort . By the end of March , they had placed a wiretap on Ivankov 's cellular phone and were cataloguing the involvement of a half-dozen lesser-known Russian emigres  --  " mutts , " in FBI parlance  --  in the attempted Summit shakedown . It appeared that Ivankov had signed on with a particularly hapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his co-conspirators were in the habit of discussing their plans on the phone . All showed a rather quaint willingness to believe the Summit officers ' promises of settlement even as the officers stayed on the move and broke one scheduled appointment after another . After Volkov failed to show at yet another meeting , this time at Manhattan 's Russian Samovar restaurant on April 19 , Sadykov complained about him to the Samovar waiters , saying that he was stranded in the United States because Volkov owed him thousands of dollars . Even Ivankov bean to complain . " I have lots of people around me and things to do , " he told Sadykov at one point . " I did not want to be on the phone all the time . I 'm being pulled in all directions . " In late April the patience of the would-be extortionists apparently ran out . On a Moscow train station platform , Vladimir Voloshin 's elderly father was set upon by thugs and severely beaten ; he died from his injuries within the week . To the Summit officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . On the evening of May 25 , they were taken to the Troika Restaurant in Fairview , New Jersey , where Sadykov waited in an upstairs office with a bit of dispiriting news : instead of 60 percent of the $2.7 million , he now wanted 100 percent of $3.5 million . Before the night was out , the Summit executives had signed a promissory note , agreeing to pay Sadykov hat amount in nine installments over the next two months . As if this was n't going to be painful enough , the terms soon changed again . On June 5 , Volkov and Voloshin were summoned to another meeting , this one presided over by Ivankov . Ivankov explained that the first payment was to be made not in a week 's time but by 2:00 P.M. the following day . For the undercover FBI team working the case , it was time to move . " This might not have been the way we would have preferred to take this case down , " explained Raymond Kerr , the agent in charge of the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some people . " The wait had been well worth it for investigators . Throughout the shakedown effort , Ivankov had remained carefully in the background  --  never personally confronting the Summit officers , conspicuously absent from the conclave at the Troika  --  and investigators had compiled only a thin string of circumstantial evidence against him . That all changed with the June 5 meeting . At the last moment , Yaponchik had stepped into the open and handed his pursuers the rope they had so desperately sought . At 7:00 A.M. on Thursday , June 8 , arresting FBI agents pounded on the door of a Brighton Beach apartment to be greeted by a bleary-eyed Ivankov , clad in underwear and a black T-shirt . In contrast to his reputation in the media for courtliness and charm , the fabled Yaponchik kicked and spat at reporters when led into court for a preliminary hearing . Elsewhere the FBI dragnet was somewhat disappointing . Although five of the low-level accomplices were collared , the two principal architects of the Summit extortion  --  Roustam Sadykov and Maxim Korostishevsky-had slipped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yaponchik , and this was enough to warrant a triumphant press release : " In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States , the FBI today arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov , allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country .... The FBI described the arrests as a significant step toward stemming the efforts of major Russian criminal organizations and a key example of the newly-developed law enforcement cooperation between Russia and the United States . " From his spacious corner office on the twenty-eighth floor of 26 Federal Plaza in New York , FBI assistant : director James Kallstrom has a spectacular view not only of upper Manhattan and portions of New Jersey but , on a clear day , the Long Island Sound and the Connecticut coastline . In the conference corner of the room , there is a low coffee table upon which sits a piece of highly polished brown granite with a small metal label : " Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , April 19 , 1995 . " As the special agent in charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians show up on law enforcement radar in the early 1990s . " We saw a problem and the potential for that problem to get worse , and that is why we moved so quickly to establish a Russian squad . Our philosophy was to contain it , to not let it gain a foothold the way the Cosa Nostra did in the Fifties and Sixties . " A big , affable man in his early fifties , Kallstrom takes a rather long view on the battle against organized crime in emigre communities , seeing it as a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the populace . " We 're in the information business , " he said . " Theoretically , we could just sit here and answer the phone and get all the information we need if the people who knew would tell it to us . Well , we do n't get it all that way , so we have to do other things . You go to Brighton Beach , or to any emigrE community where people are less familiar with the way things are done in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust law enforcement , and you can see crime thriving in those areas . The real challenge we face is Americanizing them to the extent that justice can work . By taking out Ivankov , a major criminal back in Russia , we are putting the word out that we will take action , that the system of justice here prevails . " But was Ivankov , in fact , a major criminal back in Russia ? I asked . Kallstrom motioned to the other FBI agent at the meeting , ROC squad commander Raymond Kerr . " That 's certainly the way it was told to us , " Kerr said . " A representative of the MVD told us exactly that , that Ivankov was sent here to organize the Russian criminals in North America , not just the United States but North America . " As I steered the conversation into the specifics of the Summit extortion case , Kerr became increasingly circumspect , constrained both by the limits of what could be said before the case went to trial and by the gaps that remained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he operation had n't been allowed to run a while longer , but he was generally pleased with the outcome . " Obviously , we would have preferred to wait and learn more about the structure and then taken it apart , but we could n't do that in this case , so you can say we ended up with Ivankov and essentially a bunch of mutts . But like any organization , the top management people are the ones you want to take out to destroy it . It 's no different from entering a battlefield . You talk to a tanker , what do they look for They look for the tank with all the antennas on it , and that 's the first one they want to take out . That 's the same way we do it . " James Kallstrom nodded . " The arrest of Ivankov is much more important than the case itself  --  geometrically more important than the case itself  --  because it sends a message into that community . We need the honest citizens out there to tell us what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we got Ivankov . Now there are people in those communities who understand we will take action , because they have seen the giant fall . " A funny choice of words , for the firs thing that struck me when Ivankov was led into Judge Carol Amon 's chambers in the U.S. District Courthouse in Brooklyn on the morning of June 23 was how tiny he was ; about five foot four and maybe 150 pounds . No one I had spoken to , nothing I had read , ever mentioned that . Standing alongside his celebrity lawyer , the tall and rail-thin Barry Slotnick , I was reminded less of Genghis Khan than of Mutt and Jeff . Still , he was an imposing figure : compact , muscular , the peculiar , downward slope of his eyes given an added severity by his crew cut and close-cropped beard . Sitting alone as he waited his brief turn before the judge , he seemed to withdraw into himself , staring into space with a slight , distracted frown , as if trying to remember something . Only occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost imperceptible nod the waves of the two attractive Russian women who attended all the preliminary hearings . Several times he caught me staring at him and briefly stared back , without curiosity , before gazing into space again . I suppose I was hoping for some telltale sign that would finally reveal who Ivankov was . He looked like a criminal , of course  --  anyone dressed in prison blues does  --  but I still harbored doubts about his godfather status . Rather than be assuaged , these doubts had only grown since my meeting with the FBI , since I read their account of the Summit extortion case . Just how intimate a role had Yaponchik played in the plot ? The shakedown attempt had begun in November 1994 , but Ivankov did n't physically appear on the scene until three months later . The " contract " signed at the Troika was for payments to Sadykov , not Ivankov . While it seemed clear that he had played some role in the conspiracy , this merely raised a larger question : why ? Why had this master vory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worked so hard and put himself at such risk for the 10 or 15 percent commission he would collect on a piddling $3.5 million deal But watching Ivankov in Judge Amon 's courtroom , I finally saw that all along I had been asking the wrong questions , that viewing everything from the perspective of a journalist searching for facts and documentation and plausibility  --  I had missed what was important in the Yaponchik story . An entirely different perspective was required , for I had entered a shadow world where cops , journalists , and gangsters exist and maneuver in a complex symbiosis . In this world , there was no separating myth from reality ; myth and reality were the same thing . Ivankov was a mafia godfather because it served everyone 's interest that he be one . It gave the media a frame , a way to personalize stories about a complex issue . It gave the FBI a symbol to take down , a tool with which to convince the Russian emigre community that justice would prevail . It gave the Summit extortionists the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , not least of all , it gave Ivankov the necessary status and cachet to be called upon as muscle in the first place . " Seems to me you got two possible explanations , " said Peter Grinenko after Ivankov 's arrest . " Either he guy just did n't understand the way all this works in America , or he 's a fucking idiot . As soon as the Feds started talking about him being this big vory v zakone badass and the press started putting him in silk suits , he should have seen that he was going to get whacked . Instead , it turned his head . He 's done crime the hard way his whole life in Russia , so he thinks , " Hey , I 'm a big mafia boss now , I can start making money the easy way . ' So he rides the crest of being a badass , uses it to his advantage to come in on the Summit deal , and the Feds are waiting for him . Now it 's Yaponchik 's turn , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Ivankov 's arrest , I met up with Misha , and we went for a stroll on the Brighton Beach boardwalk . He seemed happier , more relaxed , than I 'd ever seen him . Better dressed too . I wondered if it had anything to do with the Podiatry Project . I 'd heard through mutual acquaintances that Misha had teamed up with an unscrupulous Russian podiatrist , and together they were bilking Medicaid for enough foot casts and crutches to hobble a good portion of the Brooklyn citizenry . That was the rumor , anyway . When I tried to pry , Misha simply shrugged and smiled mischievously . " Some businesses are happening , some market successes . " The conversation eventually turned to Ivankov . Like many in the Russian emigre community , Misha was now openly scornful of Yaponchik , convinced that no true vory v zakone would have involved himself in something as stupid and clumsy as the Summit deal . " From the beginning , I was suspecting he is a fraud , " he said , giving a dismissive flip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources . " <p>
