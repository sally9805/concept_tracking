IN HIS NEW BEAT-'EM-UP BLOCKBUSTER , CLIFFHANGER , THE audience first glimpses Sylvester Stallone crawling along the underside of a mountain ledge , a zillion feet above sea level . Indeed , most of the movie is devoted to gorgeous Alpine scenery and daredevil feats by its star , who gets to scale icy slopes and trade gouges with villainous John Lithgow atop a chopper perched on a sheer cliff . <P> All in a day 's work for the man who turned Rocky and Rambo into household names ? Well , no . Stallone , as it happens , is deathly afraid of heights . He also suffers from tinnitus , which makes him feel dizzy and off-balance . So how did Sly , who says he handled about 75% of his own stunt work , get over his fears ? " I did n't , " he says . " I was just able to manage it . I 'd sit near the edge . Then I would move about 5 ft. closer , 2 ft. closer , not look down , psych myself out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rock face that might be 4,000 or 5,000 ft. straight down , I would look straight out and say over and over , ' Do n't look down ; do n't look down . ' " <P> The director helped . Renny Harlin ( Die Hard 2 , Nightmare on Elm Street IV ) took Stallone on location months before shooting began to get him used to the heights . He also reassured Stallone by first doing some stunts himself . That included the daring opening sequence : a failed rescue attempt that has Stallone hanging upside down on a cable between two peaks , 13,000 ft. in the air . " I was shamed into doing it , " Sly admits . " And that 's a pretty hairy stunt . " <P> Not nearly so hairy , though , as a later scene in which he clutches a ladder dangling from a helicopter as it crashes into a cliff . Or a sequence in which Stallone and a hood roll down a sharp incline together . " We were going 200 , 300 yds. straight down  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if there 's a branch or a hidden jagged rock under the snow . That really worried me . " <P> Stallone trained for the film on a 30-ft. concrete wall built next to the tennis court at his Beverly Hills home . Despite vertigo , he was drawn into the sport 's intoxicating lure : in one shot he was doing upside-down situps , hanging from a chopper , when a crew member noticed that he had no safety belt . Stallone was bothered most by scenes filmed on a seven-story indoor wall at Rome 's Cinecitta studios . " That was a lot scarier than the Alps , " he says . " There 's something about knowing that the floor is there and you could go splat at any time . " <P> What about rock climbing as a hobby ? " Are you kidding ? " Stallone says . " The pleasure climbers get from ascending cliffs is worth the pain they incur while attempting it . I never got the pleasure . The pleasure was not worth the pain . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
