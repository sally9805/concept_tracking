<p> Dear lottery player : You 're going to win the Georgia Millionaire grand prize . <p> But before that happens , you 'll probably become a pro football player , drown in a bathtub 11 times and die in your next automobile ride . In fact , there are many fates more likely to befall you this month than winning that 8 million-to-1 grand prize , which would earn you 1,000 clams a week for life , or the next 20 years , whichever comes first . <p> Some of those fates you do n't want to think about . <p> Luckily there are people like David Rorvik to think about them for you . <p> With co-authors Bernard Siskin and Jerome Staller , Mr. Rorvik compiled more than 650 unlikelihoods in the book " What Are the Chances ? " ( Signet , $ 4.50 ) , which lets us know that you are more than twice as likely to be killed by a poisonous snake than to win Georgia 's longest long shot . <p> I have no problem believing in long shots . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I did n't die , I also accept the idea of the happy freak accident . <p> I was hiking in the Grand Canyon at the time , with my friend Gordon , the physicist . Gordon says it was n't a bona-fide bolt , but an " ion path , " whatever that is . It turned my hair vertical . <p> It also convinced me not to ask too often for lucky breaks . Who knows what other big sparks I 'll need to avoid ? You use up your good luck on a dinky lottery ticket , you might get fried next time . Incarnation itself is the happiest of freak accidents . To want more is unseemly . <p> Not that there are n't some pleasant slim chances awaiting you . Mr. Rorvik 's book takes note of several , including the encouraging news that your newly published book has 1-in-487 odds of becoming one of the year 's 10 best sellers . ( In other words , you 're 16,427 times more likely to rub shoulders with Stephen King at the next booksellers ' convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But much of the book is devoted to detailing possibilities both nasty and remote . <p> Like the odds of being killed by terrorists overseas ( 1 in 650,000 ) . Or the odds of being killed by an American in Baltimore ( 1 in 4,000 . ) Or , if you do become a professional football player , the odds of sustaining a disabling injury ( virtually a 100 percent certainty ) . <p> " Death , destruction and mayhem , we have a penchant for chronicling that kind of material in our culture , " says the Portland , Ore. , writer , explaining the preponderance of unpleasant fates discussed in his book . " Just look at the evening news . " <p> " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . " <p> - William Shakespeare <p> Mr. Rorvik says compiling the book changed his mind about some dangers . <p> " There were certain things that did affect me , " he says . " We all worry about AIDS , and it is certainly a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to get us that we do n't think about . Like crossing the street , smoking a cigarette , the flu . " <p> The flu ? <p> Yes . Influenza still kills about 70,000 Americans a year , according to Mr. Rorvik 's book ; AIDS killed 29,763 in 1992 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> What 's scarier , the flu or the medicine you take to beat it ? According to " What Are the Chances ? , " adverse reactions to prescription drugs kill 125,000 Americans annually , more than AIDS and the flu put together . <p> It is the prospect of these bad endings , however marginal , that drives us into the arms of the insurance industry . We do n't mind long odds when the outcome is positive . But when we face the downside of risk - illness or accident - we 're scared even to roll the dice . We let others take that risk for us . <p> " We 're all willing to take a very tiny risk , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ econometrician Brian Sullivan . " We also pay big money to avoid big risk . " <p> " There 's a probability that you 'll come down with some dread disease and lose your house , your car . . . and so to avoid that probability you run out and get medical insurance , " says Dr. Sullivan . " And I guarantee you , on an expected-value basis , you 're paying more than what that insurance is worth . " <p> ( That is , after all , how insurance companies stay in business long enough to underwrite wildlife shows . ) <p> In other words , says Dr. Sullivan , in life 's big gamble , most of us are a bunch of pikers . <p> Why are we moon-faced optimists when we stand to win , but risk- averse worrywarts when we stand to lose ? <p> Call us too responsible . <p> It seems that our fear of real risk has expanded in this dwindling century to the point where we whine at even the inevitable slings and arrows of mundane existence . If something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better pay . <p> So we file the kind of lawsuits documented in the syndicated column News of the Weird.Such as the $ 150,000 complaint lodged in June by a Baltimore woman against Hardee 's for serving her a cup of tea that was so hot she burned her lip . And the suit filed by a New York high school student against two of his classmates , whom he charged with giving him a " flat tire " by stepping on the heel of his shoe . <p> This type of guy ought to go through life packed in bubble-wrap . <p> " A wise gamester ought to take the dice even as they fall , and pay down quietly , rather than grumble at his luck . " <p> - Sophocles <p> Yet even the pencil-neck who took offense at having his shoe stepped on probably lined up for the simulated scares of " Jurassic Park . " We 're a nation of wimps but we love the packaged fright of , say , a quick ride on Six Flags ' Free Fall . <p> Perhaps we 've insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flavor of danger , and maybe that 's the real secret of our love of casinos and lotteries , at which we threw more money last year than we spent at Kmart . <p> In fact , according to John Oliver Jones , a Hamilton , Mont. , author who is writing a book on gambling , Americans bet $ 286 billion in 1990 , " which is more money than the top three retailers took in . " <p> Says Mr. Jones , the gambling we like best is the lottery . " A hundred million people play in the lottery , " he says . " It has the worst odds but the best chance of making a million bucks . " <p> Do n't bet on it , says Dr. Sullivan . The " expected value " of the average lottery ticket - the payoff , times the odds , divided by the cost of a ticket - is generally low . By that formula , a dollar ticket for the Georgia Millionaire game is worth 54.03 cents . <p> By contrast , adds Dr. Sullivan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 95-cent payoff . That 's a much better ratio . " <p> In other words , of every dollar you pop in a slot machine , the casino keeps a nickel . The lottery keeps almost two bits . It 's a lower profit margin for the casino , but its slot machine payoffs are also lower . In the long run , both the slot machine owner and the Georgia Lottery Corp . make money , but the lottery makes it faster . <p> ( For you incipient high-rollers , Mr. Rorvik has some more odds : One in 5,000 gamblers regularly turns a profit . ) <p> " I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world . " <p> - Albert Einstein <p> How about if you just take that dollar you 'd be throwing away each week , stuff it under your mattress , and treat yourself to a movie and dinner at the end of the year ? That 's a real reward in exchange for an imaginary one . <p> But apparently it 's tough for the itchy-fingered many to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people do n't project that far ahead , " says Mr. Jones . " I 'm more inclined to think of a more immediate return . " <p> And to pray for a long shot . <p> Just be careful that when you ask for pie from the sky , you do n't get 200 million volts of juice to drink with it .
