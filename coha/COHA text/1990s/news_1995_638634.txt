<p> The nation 's Superfund law , Democrats and Republicans agree , is badly in need of legislative repair . The law that was intended to launch a federal cleanup of the nation 's most seriously polluted sites , has instead mostly produced a mountain of litigation , regulatory conflict , files of unfinished remediation plans and proposals and widespread frustration . <p> This year , amid one of the busiest congressional sessions in living memory , it will be rewritten . <p> Committees in the House and Senate are working on exactly how it should be changed , and a special task force appointed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich , is working on the particular problem of what should be done to better handle the cleanup of sites where the federal government is the prime polluter . <p> Colorado has two of the nation 's biggest Superfund headaches , the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant , where the government left behind about 14 tons of plutonium , and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal . At the latter site , the U.S. Army is responsible for the cleanup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as significant pesticide pollution which occurred when the Army leased its facilities to the Shell Oil Co . Both of these may be affected by any changes that would enlarge the role of the states in dictating the scope and pace of the cleanup . <p> Much of the congressional attention is on rewriting the general provisions of the Superfund law to limit the retroactive liability of companies and individuals that were acting lawfully when they contributed to the original contamination . The application of Superfund law has turned up hundreds of instances in which companies , or their insurers , have had to pay huge sums of money to correct problems created by waste-disposal techniques that were perfectly legal at the time . One proposal in Congress would exempt companies from liability for any acts that occurred before 1980 . Another sets the cutoff at 1987 , when federal law required an improvement in record keeping of waste disposal . <p> There also is expected to be a major debate over whether firms that played very minor roles in the contamination of a given site can be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the existing law . <p> Still another dispute involves whether municipalities should be shielded from having to pay their fair share of cleanup costs . <p> While the outcome of these issues will have significant effects on Colorado Superfund cleanups , they are not as immediately important as the unresolved question of whether the state regulators should have a larger role at Rocky Flats , the state 's most expensive Superfund site . <p> Earlier this month , Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton , joined 36 other state attorneys general , and 11 governors , including Roy Romer , in asking for a set of Superfund changes that could effectively put states in charge of specific federal cleanups . <p> The proposals were clarified at a meeting in May at Reston , Va. , among representatives of various states that have contaminated federal sites , many of them nuclear weapons facilities . Playing a lead role , in addition to Norton , was Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire . Gregoire 's home state contains the Hanford nuclear facility , often cited as the nation 's most contaminated weapons plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proposed nine principles to guide the cleanup of federal facilities and a series of specific reforms that generally would enlarge state authority over federal Superfund sites . They have asked President Clinton and congressional leaders to include their proposals as part of the Superfund rewrite . <p> The principles generally assert that states are chiefly responsible for protecting the environment and the safety and well-being of their citizens and that public participation must have " meaningful involvement in federal-facility environmental decisions . " The federal government is asked to " honor its obligation to the citizens of this country to clean up its facilities " and to " comply with environmental laws to the same extent as private parties . " To that end , it is asked to make a " sustained and sustainable commitment " and to rely more heavily on " negotiated compliance agreements " that will reduce both the costs and delays of cleanup . <p> The attorneys general are rightly critical of past efficiencies in the Department of Energy ( DOE ) and go to special pains to point out that barely one-quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the billions spent on environmental management are little more than costs associated with storage and monitoring . The agency also is taken to task for excessive reliance on outside contractors , who simply drove up the federal expense through their lucrative " cost-plus contracts . " <p> Some of these defects in the application of the existing law have already been addressed by DOE , which recently signed a " performance-based " contract with the private firm managing Rocky Flats . <p> Two of the larger issues can be addressed only through new legislation . They are : <p> Who should supervise the project ? <p> How should fights between the states over limited resources be resolved ? <p> The attorneys general propose that " qualified states " should be given authority to become the " sole regulator " of specific cleanup projects . Each state with its own " Superfund " program would be able to " implement it at federal facilities " in lieu of the federal statute . This change would allow states to review " DOE orders , as appropriate . " Superfund , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land uses for a specific site be determined early in the process . Because those decisions are not clear in connection with Rocky Flats , for example , there is no uniform agreement on what the 6,500 acres of land should eventually become . Obviously it matters greatly if the area is to be readied for residential development , or left vacant . <p> The other issue , how to reconcile conflicting budgetary demands , is addressed with a recommendation that there be an " appropriations reconciliation " meeting each year so that all of the players know about shifts in funding between sites . Such a meeting would presumably force the Department of Energy to put its national priorities on the table and allow all of the concerned states to make comments and recommendations . <p> Norton and the others who fashioned this proposal deserve credit for their efforts , but this is not one of those puzzles that can be easily or quickly solved . There remains the lingering question of why would the federal government want to turn significant spending decisions over to the states ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal facilities that are on the Superfund list . The federal taxpayers will pay the entire bill for the cleanup of these sites . Congress , faced with demands on all sides for tax revenue from school lunches to defense , wo n't want to give a blank cleanup check to the states . <p> Keep in mind that at this point it is n't possible to even estimate the full expense . Indeed , some of the wastes involved in these Superfund sites present storage and treatment issues for which there is no readily available technology . Knowledgeable people disagree on what should be done first and whether it should be done at all . When people disagree and there are delays , costs increase . One of the challenges across the country and at many sites is how to harness the skills of private industry to develop new disposal , treatment and cleanup technologies . Is that best done with national policies , or site-by-site programs ? Are local regulators in every case going to be as concerned as a national agency in keeping costs down ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the state regulators who have held out for the most expensive treatment , thus driving up the costs . <p> The fate of the recommendation of the attorneys general will properly hinge on whether Congress believes it offers adequate safeguards against expensive conflicts in the future .
