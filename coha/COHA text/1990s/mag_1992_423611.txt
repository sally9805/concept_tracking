Section : Science &; society Embarked on a search for meaning , more and more Americans are turning to the mythic psychology of the late Carl Jung <p> It came one night just as she was falling asleep , a dream of an old man all bent over , wearing shoes made out of lead . I closed my eyes , and there he was , ' Nancy Sugars recalls . Other people might have paid no attention , might have pulled up the covers and settled more deeply into slumber . But to Sugars , such images are not to be ignored . They are pregnant with meaning , the key to a world of buried symbols , a path to greater understanding . The old man is not just an old man . He is Saturn , Roman god of the seed and of the sower , ' an archetypal figure representing her animus or masculine ' side . The lead shoes are a message : Anchor yourself more closely to the Earth . <p> Nancy Sugars is not the flaky ' type . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter of a department-store manager . She lives in a modest bungalow in San Anselmo , Calif. , and on hot days serves visitors iced tea and homemade chocolate cookies . But like an increasing number of Americans , Sugars felt there was something missing in her life , a spiritual gap that needed filling . Raised an Episcopalian , she attended services but found the church 's answers unsatisfying : I was born a questioner , and it did n't make sense to me to think of heaven and hell as literal . ' Conventional psychotherapy , which ignored religious concerns , seemed equally unfulfilling . What she was looking for was something that spoke to her entire being , to both her mind and her spirit . And what she found , finally , was the work of Carl Gustav Jung . <p> Cultural touchstone . Thirty-one years after the Swiss psychiatrist 's death , Jung 's theories are surging in popularity , becoming a cultural touchstone , a lens for processing experience , in some cases almost a religion . In churches , quotes from Jung 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pages liberally with Jungian buzzwords . Books on Jungian topics  --  most recently , Women Who Run With the Wolves , ' by Jungian analyst Clarissa Pinkola Estes  --  are climbing the bestseller list . And while the men 's movement urges men to reconnect with the masculine archetype of the warrior , ' drawing on Jung 's notion of universal symbols buried in the human psyche , feminist writers encourage women to explore the goddess ' inside them . Even Madison Avenue has discovered Jung : In a recent commercial , a beer drinker jokes that an appreciation of Budweiser 's finer qualities may be stored in the collective ' unconscious . Says Chicago Jungian analyst Murray Stein : It 's a theory whose time has come . ' <p> Not all that long ago , the relevant question for many Americans was Carl who ? ' Freudian theory , with its emphasis on early childhood experience and repressed sexual and aggressive drives , dominated psychiatry and penetrated deeply into popular culture . But Jung was familiar to most people only as a footnote to Freud : The fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary . Jungian theory , stressing psychological wholeness and filled with myths , fairy tales and literary and philosophical allusions , attracted a select following  --  creative artists , Freudian renegades , a celebrity or two , wealthy ladies with a yen to travel to Zurich . James Joyce brought his daughter to see the psychiatrist ; painter Jackson Pollack sought Jungian analysis . And Jungian theory enjoyed brief bursts of broader popularity : His memoir , Memories , Dreams , Reflections , ' published in 1962 , became something of a counterculture classic . <p> But psychology courses gave Jungian psychology only passing mention , and scholars in other disciplines shunned him , dismissing his theories as unscientific ' and quasi-mystical . There were reports that Jung was antisemitic , that he became romantically entangled with former patients . Psychiatrists rarely bothered to read him at all . Jung was , in their view , an eccentric genius who had strayed into areas that could only be called loosey-goosey . ' As one Freudian analyst scoffed , Jungian theory ? What theory ? ' <p> But if Freud spoke most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jung has the public 's ear as the century draws to a close . Ironically , the appeal of Jungianism may hinge on the very quality that made it unacceptable to an earlier generation : a blend of psychology and spirituality that draws no firm boundary between the language of the psyche and the language of the soul . While scholars may view the two as uneasy bedfellows , some experts see in Jung 's rising influence a larger popular trend , a movement that Peter Homans , professor of religion and psychological studies at the University of Chicago Divinity School , dubs Religion-and-Psychology . ' <p> When social structures fall apart and traditional belief systems disintegrate , Homans says , people engage in meaning-making ' to restore cohesion in their lives . There is a hunger these days , a gnawing dissatisfaction with the answers provided by materialism and scientific progress , a craving for an inner life . Politicians sense it in their constituents , and grasp at words like values . ' College professors detect it in students who wonder if there is n't something beyond deconstructionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flock to them , ready to try everything from holotropic breathing ' to channeling . Increasingly , Americans are looking for solutions that speak to the spirit as well as the psyche . <p> No creeds . In this climate of yearning , Jungian psychology is blossoming . It offers a spiritual path for people too skeptical to embrace fundamentalism or the traditional Sunday-service view of heaven and hell . It draws those who are psychologically minded but unwilling to have their behavior explained solely in terms of childhood insecurities or frustrated drives . What Jung provides , ' says Ann Ulanov , of Union Theological Seminary in New York , is the explicit recognition of spirituality , without reducing it to psychological complexes , or trying to define it in specific creeds . ' <p> On a March afternoon in 1907 , a 50-year-old Viennese Jew and the 31-year-old son of a Swiss Protestant minister met for the first time . Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung talked that day for 13 hours straight , and in the years that followed forged a friendship more intense than either man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help him carry his revolutionary theories to a wider audience . He had been waiting , Freud wrote to his disciple , until a voice from the unknown multitude should answer mine . That voice was yours . ' For his part , Jung found in Freud 's work a source of illumination . ' Freud was , Jung reflected later , the first man of real importance I had encountered ; in my experience up until that time , no one else could compare with him . ' When , after six years , their relationship dissolved into recriminations and then complete estrangement , the loss was profound , scarring both men for life . <p> The split between Freud and Jung was a complicated one , a father-son rivalry involving petty jealousies , disputes over theory and deeply injured feelings . But in part , it centered on an argument about the meaning of religious experience . To Freud , an atheist steeped in scientific rationalism , religion was merely a comforting illusion , ' a sublimation of sexuality and aggression , the true forces that underlie human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirituality was not a crutch but life 's noblest ground . Asked once by a BBC interviewer if he believed in God , Jung replied , I do n't need to believe  --  I know . ' <p> Early visions . Jung 's religious quest was a deeply personal one . As a young man , he rebelled against his father 's rigid theology but never questioned the existence of some higher spiritual order . Even as a child , he reported dreams and visions ' of a religious nature . My whole being was seeking for something still unknown which might confer meaning upon the banality of life , ' Jung wrote in his memoirs . Like Freud , Jung considered himself a scientist , and he , too , stressed the importance of dreams and the workings of the unconscious mind . But in the end , Jung rejected both Freud 's focus on sexuality and the older man 's pessimistic conviction that neurosis is an inevitable part of human life . Instead , he held that in every human being  --  and every society  --  there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect with something larger . <p> Jung found confirmation of his theories in his patients ' dreams , in the myths , fairy tales and folklore of diverse cultures , in Eastern religion and Christian icons . Where Freud saw the unconscious ' as the domain of childhood ideas and wishes repressed by the conscious mind , Jung found this concept too limiting . Deeper than Freud 's personal ' unconscious , Jung argued , lay the collective ' unconscious , the repository for archetypes ' or universal images and modes of perceiving the world that could not be explained in terms of a single person 's life . Archetypes , Jung held , were rooted in instinct , and emerged in dreams , in the age-old stories of gods and warriors , in tales of giants and evil stepmothers . They often represented the hidden or shadow ' side of human nature , both negative and positive . We can never legitimately cut loose from our archetypal foundations , ' he wrote , unless we are prepared to pay the price of a neurosis , any more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing suicide . ' <p> Yet by investigating and interpreting the archetypal images buried deep in the psyche , Jung maintained , an individual or a culture might grow and become whole . A man , for example , could explore the anima archetype , developing the latent , feminine side of his nature ; a society might become aware of the concealed , destructive images that influence its ebb and flow . And through an understanding of the collective unconscious , the psychiatrist believed , lay the path toward inner transformation . ' <p> To the generation of the 1940s and ' 50s , newly enthralled with the promise of science and technology , with Darwinian evolution and Einsteinian physics , the Freudian view of mental life struck a sympathetic chord . But in a country deeply imbued with Christian religious striving and family values , ' Freud 's scorn for religion and emphasis on childhood sexuality never sat entirely comfortably . Admiration gradually gave way to a detailed examination of his clay feet  --  his attitudes toward women , his psychological reductionism , ' his focus on early parenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Americans to accept . <p> Transcendental roots . By contrast , Jung 's vision presents less of a challenge to the way Americans see themselves , making room for the life of the spirit ' unfettered by more iconoclastic analysis . Jung appeals , as Jungian analyst and men 's movement leader James Hillman puts it , to our Emersonian roots . ' Where Freud pulled back the curtains on what he regarded as self-deception in religious life , Jung went to work with an embroidery needle , distrusting any theory that robbed human beings of something transcendent in which to believe . As a result , Jungian psychology has become , for many people , a way to reclaim and enrich their religious upbringing . Says one Jungian analyst : I left the church because it was dead and boring . Now I go back and appreciate services in a way I never could before . ' <p> Perhaps sensing this , a growing number of Christian clergy are incorporating Jungian ideas into their work with parishioners . Jungian training institutes count among their students both Episcopal and Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centerpoint , a network of study groups once affiliated with the Episcopal Church but now free-standing , has an estimated 15,000 members worldwide . Jung 's theories are even finding their way into sermons and pastoral counseling programs . It fits so much better than a Freudian approach , because Freud was an atheist , ' says the Rev. Philip Blake of the Jesuit Retreat House of Los Altos , Calif . I live my life according to the Gospel message , not according to Carl Jung . But it 's a help to me . ' <p> Indeed , for some devotees , Jung 's work has replaced organized religion altogether . Analyst Edward Edinger , for example , places Jung among history 's greatest religious figures . And in a paper entitled With Jungian Psychology , Do We Need Religion ? ' psychologist Kendra Smith reports that a woman she knows claims Jungian psychology as her spiritual path and dream analysis as her spiritual discipline . ' <p> Not everyone is celebrating the current Jungian vogue , to be sure . While Jung 's work is making inroads into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain critical of a theory that mixes discussions of the soul , alchemy and Jesus Christ into treatises on neurosis . Psychology is supposed to be scientific , and in the final analysis all religion tops out with the supernatural , ' protests psychologist Albert Ellis , president of the Institute for Rational-Emotive Therapy in New York City . Even admirers of Jung 's work find his explanations of the link between psyche and spirit sometimes fuzzy and inconsistent . Says Richard Smoley , editor of the San Francisco-based journal Gnosis : There is something fundamentally problematical about mixing the two . ' <p> Jungian analysts , hypersensitive to the psychiatrist 's reputation as a mystic , often sidestep the religion ' question and tend to steer away from Jung 's wilder theoretical notions  --  his discussions of astrology and UFOs , for example . Some analysts worry that the spread of Jungian terminology in popular culture is already resulting in the oversimplification of complicated ideas . A lot of things are done in the name of Jung that would make the old man roll around in his grave , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the History of Religions . <p> In the end , the appeal of Jung 's view of life may go beyond matters of spirituality , touching something deeper , something that has to do with the jumbled , confusing image reflected in a late-20th-century mirror . A typical Jungian case history moves quickly from a discussion of psychological symptoms to analyses involving Greek gods , wise old men , spirit guides and witches . Viewed in its most positive sense , the new interest in Jung represents an effort to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world , its myths and symbols creating what Doniger terms an invisible community . ' Jung 's theory , says British analyst Andrew Samuels , is a mongrel ' psychology , mixing myths and symbols of disparate cultures , yet linking all humanity through the collective unconscious . It speaks , he says , to a question on many people 's minds in the 1990s : To what extent am I supremely myself , and to what extent do I share an identity with others ?

In the lore that surrounds him , there are stories of miracle ' cures , prophetic visions and mysterious coincidences . <p> Yet Jung also had a darker side , a shadow ' aspect of his character that made him a lightning rod for controversy . From the start , both his theories and actions drew censure , with one critic labeling him a fascistic , frothy psychoanalyst . ' As interest in his theories grows , Jungian scholars find themselves questioning how much Jung 's personal history should influence the way his work is viewed . <p> There is , for example , the matter of his romantic involvements with two former patients , Toni Wolff and Sabina Spielrein . Did he take advantage of these women 's vulnerability ? Or was he simply operating under a different set of moral principles that must be understood in historical perspective ? Jung himself did little to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 for a psychotic depression following the death of her father . After recovering , she became the psychiatrist 's colleague and also his mistress , accompanying him home for Sunday dinners with his family and even going into analysis with Jung 's wife , Emma . If eyebrows were raised , they were raised without comment . It never went outside his circle , ' says Thomas Kirsch , president of the International Association for Analytical Psychology . <p> Quiet liaison . Less open was an earlier entanglement with another former patient , Sabina Spielrein , the subject of a forthcoming book by New York psychoanalyst and historian John Kerr . Spielrein , an intense , black-haired Russian , was admitted to Burgholzli Hospital , where Jung successfully treated her for hysteria . Like Wolff , she later worked side by side with her former psychiatrist . She also became his lover , Kerr says , though Jung eventually broke off the relationship , fearing its disclosure would hurt his career . <p> Jung 's romantic involvements , some critics contend , set a dangerous precedent and speak to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst and patient in Jungian circles . In today 's world , where romantic relationships between therapists and patients are deemed unethical and in some states even criminal , Jung 's followers have had to struggle to distance themselves from his example . <p> There are other aspects of the psychiatrist 's life that scholars also find troubling . Last year , for example , a conference in New York addressed the question of whether Jung was antisemitic . His characterization of Hitler as a true leader ' in a 1933 radio interview and his role as president of a Nazi-controlled medical society sparked allegations that he was a Nazi sympathizer , though he later denounced the Third Reich . Some critics go so far as to question Jung 's mental stability , pointing to the unusual experiences he describes in his memoirs and to some of his more outlandish theoretical wanderings . <p> Whatever the truth , finding full answers to many of the questions surrounding Jung 's life may take years . The psychiatrist 's intimate letters have yet to be made public , and The Red Book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional turmoil following his break from Freud , also remains unpublished . The Red Book ' is very private , and C. G. Jung was against publishing it , ' says his grandson , L. Niehus . Yet even when the full historical archive is made available to scholars , odds are that the Swiss psychiatrist will still be controversial : The name Jung seldom leaves people cold , ' wrote the Jungian analyst Marie-Louise von Franz in 1972 about her longtime friend and colleague . When one mentions him , one almost always runs into emotionally loaded rejection or enthusiasm and only rarely objective judgment . ' <p> Picture : Jung and wife , Emma .
