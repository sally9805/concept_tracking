A CHANGE IN THE WIND , MARIAH <P> If Whitney Houston can do it , why ca n't MARIAH CAREY ? The diva of deep record sales is dipping her toes into the waters of acting . The video for her new song , Honey , which debuts this week , opens with a comedy sketch , after which she scampers around like a Bond girl ( read : lots of changes into different , but equally skimpy , outfits ) . She 's also in discussions about doing a movie . " It 's a great way to release different creative energy , " Carey says of acting . Her music is also changing  --  away from touchy-feely ballads to more collaborations with hip-hop artists . And her lyrics are more personal , perhaps because her separation from Sony honcho Tommy Mottola has given her more to write about . She also finds she 's more written about . " Every time I meet someone now or just talk to them at a party , " she says , " people speculate . " <P> FAREWELL TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most colorful , vibrant palettes in the fashion business , but at his memorial Mass , few could bring themselves to wear anything but sober black . More than 2,000 mourners , from family and fashion-industry friends to some of the world 's most celebrated clotheshorses , including PRINCESS DIANA and CAROLYN BESSETTE KENNEDY , gathered in the Duomo in Milan , where ELTON JOHN and STING ( who wore Versace to his wedding to TRUDIE STYLER ) performed an a cappella rendition of Psalm 23 , The Lord Is My Shepherd . The designer 's sister DONATELLA and brother SANTO wept profusely , as did NAOMI CAMPBELL . John too was particularly overcome . Before the service he broke down in tears in front of the urn containing Versace 's ashes . Earlier in the week , a British newspaper editor had borne the brunt of the singer 's wrath when he called to remonstrate about a less than flattering obituary . Better not tell him that at least three Versace book projects are already under way , including a quickie true-crime novel . <P> CELEBRITY COURT SHUFFLE <P> COPPERFIELD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COPPERFIELD 's learning : if you ca n't make something disappear , sue the people who created it . Paris Match says Copperfield 's long engagement to CLAUDIA SCHIFFER is an illusion  --  something millions of males would dearly love to believe . The mag published a contract between Copperfield 's German promoter and Schiffer that showed she was paid $20,000 for attending the 1993 show where the two met . The suit states that Paris Match added that the supermodel now gets paid for pretending to be Copperfield 's fiance and does n't even like him . Copperfield is n't denying the first deal , but he 's so incensed at the second that he 's suing for $30 million . <P> STATE V. AUTUMN JACKSON
