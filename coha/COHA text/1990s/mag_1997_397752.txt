With GPS satellites whizzing overhead , who needs a compass anymore ? Why , you do . // TWO OF THE WONDERS OF the Orient that Marco Polo brought back to Italy under the sails of his Venetian galley were gunpowder and the compass . In the 700 years since , man 's fascination with the former has gotten him lost in such disparate hunting grounds as the Kalahari Desert and the Kenai Peninsula , while his ability to use the latter has returned him safely to camp . Staying found is simply a matter of knowing approximately where you are at all times , and any discussion must begin with the sliver of steel that points to the poles of the earth . The earliest Mongol compass was nothing more elaborate than a shard of ore that , when floated on a piece of wood , aligned itself with one end pointing to the magnetic north . Today 's compasses , with their steel needles damped in housings of alcohol , offer the cheapest , most reliable navigational tools available to the hunter and , next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has against becoming lost . Taking a bearing on distant landmarks has been reduced to a simple formula with the protractor or baseplate-type compasses pioneered by Silva ( see diagram ) . These compasses can also be aligned with the edge of a U.S. Geological Survey map to give a precise bearing between two mapped positions . The only fly in the ointment is that you must take into consideration declination , which is the difference between magnetic north and the true north that is marked on the map . ( The angle of declination is marked at the bottom of the map . ) For example , I hunt in Montana , where the declination is 18 degrees east . To compensate , I use a ruler and pencil to overlay the vertical north-south lines on my map with a series of diagonal north-south lines that correspond to the magnetic declination . The alternative is to compensate by adjusting the dial of the compass , which I find confusing and bothersome . Good baseplate compasses need not set you back more than $15 to $20 , and I strongly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor 's farm obtain a manual such as Bjorn Kellstrom 's Be Expert With Map and Compass , then practice on open terrain before taking to the woods . Better yet , sign up for an orienteering course . Compass navigation , which is very simple indeed , seems complex when it is described or illustrated in articles . With an instructor at your side , you 'll pick it up in 5 minutes . Courses are periodically offered in my area through adult education programs and by the local outdoor society . The U.S. Orienteering Federation , P.O. Box 1444 , Forest Park , GA 30298 , telephone ( 404 ) 363-2110 , : can put you in touch with a program in your area . ONCE YOU 'VE LEARNED THE IMportance of marking your progress on the map , taking a bearing between obvious landmarks and looking over your shoulder to see what those landmarks will look like upon your return , there is n't much excuse for getting lost as long as you follow two axioms of compass navigation . The first is to trust that the magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of direction . If your head says camp is one way when the needle is telling you the opposite , believe the steel . The second is to plan your hunt with regard to straight lines of reference . Photograph To navigate with a baseplate compass , first pick a landmark you can walk toward . Then point the direction-of-travel arrow at it and turn the compass housing until the needle lies over the orienting arrow . The direction you want to go is 160% SSE. // The lines may include roads , forest trails , power lines , fire lines , rivers , or any other features of geography that follow relatively straight courses . For example , I track elk along the ridges that rise to the west side of a river that flows roughly north to south . No matter how aimlessly I hunt , I can always find my way back to the river by heading east . It 's simply . matter of taking a bearing on a distant tree , hiking to the tree , taking a bearing to another tree , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket thrown into the mix , until reaching the bank . Because I know the country , it does n't much matter if I come back to the river upstream or downstream of the ford I waded across in the morning . But were I hunting in unfamiliar surroundings , it would be important to plot a return course that would take me definitely to one side or the other of the crossing , so that I 'd know which way , to turn to find my waders ( see illustration ) . Hunting in country that lies beyond the end of a spur road or trail is a little trickier , but by following the principle of setting a course to return to one side or other of the road , rather than attempting to hit it dead on , a hunter can cut back with the certainty of finding his car again ( see illustration ) . // Rather than attempting to return directly to a river crossing , plot a compass course that returns you to one side or the other . Then , when you hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the crossing . To find your vehicle on the return trip , plot a course that takes you to one side or the other of the deadend road . Walk until you 're certain you 're past the dead end , then cut in to find the road and backtrack to your vehicle . Bisect a drainage or ridgetop with a line of flags extending from your campsite to ensure that returning hunters know where to turn to find camp . // Pitching camp in a monotonously uniform forest is never a good idea unless you enjoy verging on panic when the tent is n't where it 's supposed to be at the end of the day , but sometimes you camp where you can . Here again , a wise man hunts by the rule of straight lines , except in this case it 's necessary for him to make those lines . I knew a marten trapper who blazed tree trunks in a cross pattern that radiated from his tent in the Selway Wilderness for more than a mile in each direction . My brother and I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ridge or a creekbottom along which returning hunters will travel ( see illustration ) . Today , the practice of blazing trees is rightly frowned upon , but marking tape affixed to branches does the job as well ; just remember to collect your tape at the end of the hunt . Steep , heavily forested country , where it 's impossible to walk more than a few feet in a straight line , can make exact compass navigation exasperating . This is where an altimeter shines ; it will tell you when you 've reached the elevation of the saddle where your tent is pitched , or if you have to climb another 300 feet to reach the contour of the ridge where your partner got into the elk last week . I never leave camp without both tools in my pack , together with an aerial photograph of the country superimposed with contour lines ; still , on more than one occasion , I have caught myself turning in circles through thickets of pine . LAST FALL , MY BROTHER KEVIN and I left an elk wallow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the same wallow an hour later , tied again , and wound up quenching our thirst in the tiny spring by that wallow after a third circuit well past nightfall . We both carried survival packs and I was all for spending the night then and there , envisioning a Jack London scenario with two men spinning ever tightening circles until dropping from exhaustion . Kevin talked me into trying again , and this time navigating by the stars , we stumbled back to camp in the small hours of the morning . This brings up several points . One is that trying to navigate in failing light leads to poor judgment . Allow plenty of time to hike back before nightfall . If you insist on hunting at last light , at least pick a place beside a trail that will lead you directly back to camp . Remember , too , that staying found is knowing only approximately where you are . My brother and I were found , all right ; we simply could n't locate a tiny tent on the flat top of a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't find camp are no more lost than we were . The difference-and in cold weather it can be a fatal difference-is that some may be unprepared to spend the night . A pack will see you through the darkness , and as long as you are carrying a map or know your position with regard to one straight line of reference , your compass will guide you home in the morning . <p>
