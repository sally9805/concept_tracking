You sit on a rocker on a porch on an island in the Caribbean and try to make sense of what really happened then . The mother was a chain smoker and it played into the plot . The father was a camera enthusiast and it was key to the outcome of the story . Typical tourists is what you tell yourself . You replay your memory tape of the day once again . No hard copy exists . We are a quiet island , you say , mostly nothing ever happens here . Except for that one time , nothing does . But that once , everything came flooding tidal wave fast and furious . Only you did n't see it coming . <p> Or did you ? You were saying to Harry , " Look at the rush of them . " <p> " Looks like the usual crowd to me . " <p> " Are you kidding ? The Caribbean Star is the biggest new ship in the fleet . It 's too big to anchor at our dock . They have to dinghy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> You watch Harry shrug his shoulders and hike up the waist of his shorts . " So I guess we 'll sell more cameras and film today , " he says and pours you some iced teas . He seems neither happy nor disappointed about it . He is just stating a fact . You like the way Harry is casual about things . How nothing seems to be a problem for him and how things that need doing will get done in their own good time . Nothing ruffles Harry . You wish you could adopt his unruffled manner . Hope some of his easy ways will rub off on you . An osmosis , you think . Maybe that 's why you come here every day to his camera shop when you should be out around the island scouting stories . Getting juicy tidbits and eye-catching headlines for The Press . Wait , you tell yourself , the best stuff can always be found at Harry 's . Everybody comes to Harry 's Camera Shop . <p> You look at them rushing up Mongoose Run . Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more of them . They 're here with cameras hanging from their necks and knapsacks bulging behind their backs . They wear pouches on zippered belts with hiding places for their money . Some have shoulder sacks . All have those pink booklets to tell them where to shop and what to buy . The booklets are all over the island , in every shop , at the airport , and have been given to all the cruise lines that dock here and airplanes that land here . Maybe we 're not so quiet an island , after all , you think . You know every word of copy and all the advertisements . You worked on putting the pink thing together . Faint memories of the paste-ups , even the whiff of the inks at the press okay , still come to mind . Harry sips his tea and gives his rocker a few more rocks . His feet are propped up on the porch railing . No reason for him to move until the first tourist puts a toe on a step and starts to climb up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building from the slave days of sugar and rum , built with thick white walls to keep the heat out . One step inside and right away you start to feel cool . Generally the breezes of the trade winds blow off the porch through Harry 's opened doors and windows clear to the back of the store . It makes one hard put to leave Harry 's too soon . <p> Especially since Harry keeps a jug of iced tea and paper cups stacked on the porch . There are a few chairs which the tourists like to rock in . Whether they 're on their way to Pelican 's Perch or on their way back to Coral Bay , and whether they buy cameras or lenses or film , or just leave off film to be developed , or not even that , most folks enjoy a stop at Harry 's . Harry himself is happy if there 's a quiet spell in the flow of business . Then he 'll sit and rock and spin stories about the island and this Caribbean Sea we 're plunked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , " you say , which for you means until twoish . Harry smiles . His wife , Becky , will be in at eleven , but his regular helper , Hector , is off in Puerto Rico on a short vacation , so you think Harry 's glad you 'll be staying to work the lunch crowd . Today he 'll need all the extra hands he can get , even though he is not saying it . <p> Some days you do interviews on the porch , but not today , you tell yourself sharply . You get up and walk into the shop before Harry does . The clamor starts . A buzz of conversation , the whir of the fans , and the sound of locks being unlocked and glass cases sliding open and closed , take the quiet out of the place . You feel a heady kind of high with the noise , and you 're happy now that people are here and you 're not in the rocker drinking tea . In the back of your head the old line echoes : Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye the tourists like they are items for sale . Things to be bartered . Riches to be traded . Look at their assets : how pretty they are , how handsome , how short or how tall . Sometimes how strange . Search for their flaws , some quirk that can be parlayed into a sentence , a story . Who makes a character ? you wonder . How many snippets of how many people can be patchworked together to fabricate one good one . Look for the news , you say , as you pull a Nikon from the case on the far wall and slide the glass closed and lock it . This man knows exactly what he wants with no jabber as to the camera 's special features . You let him be and put your back to the case . You face the main counter where Harry is showing a different camera to another man and try to be nonchalant . Let your customer view the camera without pressing him the way you 've seen other salesmen do , and the way you 've had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of talking , asking a lot of questions . He 's looking through the lens of the camera and focusing as if to shoot first into one corner of the store , then into another . He walks to the door , and from behind the camera , eyesup Mongoose Run and down . This is a serious purchase for him . You try not to stare or to be preoccupied with his decision . From where you are you hear him say : something , something about apertures , something else about film speeds , something or another about sunny days and gray days . You let your eyes wander around the room , as one does , when one wants to appear to be passing time . Then you see it . It 's a wicker basket sitting on the floor tucked in a niche under Harry 's main counter . There is a column on one side of it and the basket is in a protected spot out of the way of people 's feet . Recessed the way it is under the showcase of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as you are able to tell . Something in the basket moves . You 're not sure what , so you look harder . You see a hand . A tiny hand stretches up and into the air . Now it reaches back to . . . a mouth . <p> " God , it 's a baby , " you say only to yourself . You look , not believing it . It is in a simple wicker basket , not one of those baby-carrying things . Whoever the parents are , they seem content to leave the basket in this niche while they go about their purchase . Outside on the porch , other people are drinking iced teas . Some are smoking cigarettes and others rocking gently and you hear the creaky noises they 're making on the floorboards . You look harder this time . She is dressed in pink gingham and is terribly new . Small . With a little round head and big eyes . Such a good baby , not a peep comes out of her . She does not sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their fingers in their mouths . She puts you in one of those dazes people let themselves get into when they 're captured by something and ca n't quite believe it . <p> It 's then the man standing next to you says , " I 'll take it , " and hands the Nikon over . He is too busy to notice the basket . He keeps his eyes on the Nikon in your hand , afraid you will drop it or scratch the lens . That 's when you walk behind the counter and write up the sale and wrap the camera . It 's when you stop studying the basket . Stop letting yourself be caught in a dream over the tiny hand . It 's when the man tears the package from your hand with a tug and jolts you back to Harry 's shop and all the people in it . He then bolts out the door and you happen to notice the profile of a woman who is leaving Harry 's a few steps in front of him . She is a small woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue top and has shapely legs . On her feet she wears sandals . She is carrying the basket . <p> You think nothing of it . Inside you gloat a little because you 've sold an expensive Nikon fast . Though really you do n't deserve credit for it . The customer simply knew what he wanted . Harry 's man is another story . He seems to be taking forever to decide . Until finally he does and you 're surprised to see him flipping out his wallet . He pays for his camera and leaves . Seconds only after he walks out , he walks back in . A tall woman is with him . Her hair is dark and she wears it pinned up in a topknot . She has on a white pinafore with a ruffle that flounces at the hem and looks ready for a tea party , you think . <p> " The basket-have you seen the basket ? " the man asks . His voice has an excited pitch , and he is eyeing the counters and floor with quick looks everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ago , " you tell them . <p> " Did n't you see her ? " he says to the woman with the topknot . <p> " I thought you had the baby ? " the woman says . <p> " I thought she was with you . I was buying the camera . " <p> " I only went out for a smoke . " <p> " You must have closed your eyes and dozed in one of those rockers . " <p> " I did not doze . " <p> " Did you see the woman go with the basket ? " <p> " Do n't ask me what I saw . You were too busy examining cameras to see what was going on in front of you . " Her voice this time , is a growl . <p> The man growls too , " Lollygagging with a cigarette . Always smoking . Did you have to leave her on the floor ? " <p> " I thought she 'd be cooler . " <p> " Thought ? Why did n't you think with your eyes instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . You hear her sandals make swift clicks on the cobblestones . She hurries in and out of shops screaming , " Have you seen a woman with a wicker basket ? Where is my baby ? Have you seen my baby ? " She pulls the topknot of her hair free and combs her fingers through it , the way a person in a frenzy often does . There is a stormy and manic look about her . She looks trapped in the trauma of this catastrophe . She pulls at her dress and flattens and crimps it with shaky hands . She rubs her skin at her breasts and by the top of her pinafore and at her neck . She comes back to Harry ' s and paces his porch . She chain-smokes miles . <p> The father does not stay put either . He is the madman who races to Front Street and back . Opens the closed doors of shops and shouts , " Where 's the baby ? " Runs through doorways like wind . Clatters hangers on racks and shakes the clothes dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shades of umbrellas if they have seen anything . It is as if people have gone blind . In the instance when someone has n't , the conflicting news they have to give throws the father into only more confusion . " Does n't anybody on this island have eyes ? " he shouts up the cobblestones on his return to Harry 's . His body is in a sweat , his hair wild from tearing at it . <p> " Ca n't you see we 've lost her ? " the mother huffs . <p> Mother and father bicker until the police come . Their voices carry loud down the street . Quickly the news travels to the airport and the harbor . The Coast Guard sends men to man the ships , which are kept frozen at their anchors . Everyone is stopped and questioned . Coves are searched . Nooks are looked into . Branches are lifted and islanders finger for baskets down near the roots of plants . The police do not give blond women peace . The rest of us do n't get any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police have and ones the FBI sends in . But none of the women has her face . I sit with an artist and tell him what to sketch . He charcoals in and rubs out and I am never satisfied . Finally he draws a face close to the one I keep seeing in my mind . Still it does n't help any of us find the woman . <p> Weeks pass and they 're still here , the mother and father whose name is Joy . You choke for breath at the irony of their name . James , the husband , has set up a command center in an empty storefront the island has donated to the Joys on Front Street . They have installed fax machines and phone lines . James has designed flyers and a newsletter dedicated to finding his daughter , Penny . He has posted information and included pictures of her in major newspapers throughout the U.S. , at leading airports , and at ports of call for the cruise ships that come here . He worries , he says , about the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South America ? he wonders , not to mention everywhere else . He claims he will not rest until Penny Joy is found . And if she is n't ? we islanders ask . <p> Do n't say it , he tells us . <p> But what if ? some persist . <p> Then I 'll dedicate my life to finding missing children . He does n't give up . <p> You fear his wife , Addie , has already given up . She walks the tightrope between sorrow and madness . <p> Addie Joy is sedated . Doctors argue over the dosage of her medication . One thing they agree upon : if they prescribe less than so many milligrams she weeps without stopping . This weeping starts with an eerie moan and ranges to a high-pitched wail . It includes muffled sobs and outright cries . Her face and eyes have become a grandmother to the face and eyes you saw at Harry 's the day of the baby stealer . Women of the island have taken turns looking after her while James is kept busy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often she wanders on the beach in her pinafore , which has turned to gray . She refuses to put on anything else . Recently a bulletin went out across the island that she was missing . The police found her crouched down and hiding in an old sugar mill . She had smoked several cigarettes whose butts were on the floor . But before their red tips were put out one last time she had tried to stamp out the little fires on her arms and hands . Tiny burns zigzagged in trails and clusters on her . She was singing , the police reported : Hush little baby do n't you cry , daddy 's gon na find you by and by . <p> Early mornings gentle trade winds blow and often in the nights . Life on our little island has become again predictable since the year the family of Joys have left us . Word is the father has gone , as he has said , and made children his cause . Addie Joy , on the other hand , has lost her mind . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps saying on days when she talks at all , we hear . So much for happy endings . <p> Every day , no matter how bright the sun or how cool the trades , you swallow the bitter pill that with eyes so opened it turned out you were blind . Yes , it happened here on paradise where nothing more than God 's sweet sun and gentle trades are supposed to happen . Since the fall of paradise , things you thought you believed , you find no longer to be true . You 've come up with new guidelines : <p> Not all people can be trusted . <p> Memories can not be erased . <p> Mistakes are irreversible . <p> All things are possible . <p> We have a false sense of security to the real dangers among us . <p> Life is full of riddles you 'll never figure out . <p> Expect the unexpected . <p> Today starts out the same as every other . More tourists come up Mongoose Run and Harry slaps his hands on his knees and gets up from the rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Look , what 's happened is done . Get on with it . Do n't look back , " he says . <p> " Do n't you wonder , Harry , if she 's riding a bike , or swimming , or ice skating right this minute ? " <p> " You 're looking for a happy ending . " <p> " We do n't know if she 's alive . " <p> " Exactly , " Harry says . " You ca n't unmake the past . " <p> Still you fight Harry 's advice and rummage for a better sense of things . Retape finishes of what might be to replace any real ending which you probably will never know . Penny Joy is gone . She has vanished . No one ever found her . There is no happy ending here . <p> You wonder about the tickings of people 's inner clocks . What made the mother go on the porch for a smoke and leave the basket where she did ? What made the father be so preoccupied with his multitude of questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoned lip ? A simple word or two might have done the trick and gotten the baby stealer to stop in her tracks and put the basket down . <p> Perhaps the father would have quit his questions and forgotten the camera long enough to get his hands on the basket . Maybe the mother would have smashed the cigarette , stepped out of the rocker and stood in front of the doorway on Harry 's porch . What if she grabbed the basket and took hold of her baby ? The ending would have been different if , if , and if . <p> Harry comes out on the porch with a pitcher of iced tea in his hands . " Still looking for a better ending ? " he asks . <p> You take a deep breath and suck in all you can of this Caribbean air you know to be precious . " You know me , it 's what gets me through until tomorrow . " <p>
