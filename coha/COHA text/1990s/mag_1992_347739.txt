AS HE WALKS IN A SOFT DRIZZLE TO his car next to the campaign headquarters in Little Rock , George Stephanopoulos hardly seems like a major player in any drama  --  much less a presidential succession . Described by his colleague and close friend Paul Begala as a guy " well over four feet tall slumming in a jeans jacket with an MTV haircut , " he has , at 31 , leaped ahead of his elders to be at the red-hot center of the Clinton universe . While everyone knows who he is  --  his face is now beamed round the world as transition communications director  --  it is hard to figure out how someone so self-effacing ended up where he is . <P> In 1988 he worked on Michael Dukakis ' campaign as head of the " rapid response " team , a wildly misnomered unit that reacted to Bush 's assaults by dreaming up counterattacks that the candidate then rarely delivered . His main job , Stephanopoulos jokes , was to serve as a sounding board for one-liners to see if they would get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek without a sense of humor . " <P> Still , he made enough of a reputation for himself that in 1991 he was wooed by both the Bob Kerrey and Clinton campaigns . Stephanopoulos recalls the instant rapport that he felt during his first meeting with Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg . " Midway through the interview , " says Stephanopoulos , " I started working for him . " <P> This time around , his fantasies became the campaign . After traveling at Clinton 's side through the primaries , Stephanopoulos settled last May into a messy office with two banks of phones . He became Clinton incarnate , so imbued with the candidate 's philosophy and policy that when he spoke it was as if Clinton were there . " He made everything happen , " says media consultant Mandy Grunwald . To mainline the candidate 's unfiltered personality to the voters , Stephanopoulos orchestrated appearances on talk shows and MTV . He pulled together Clinton 's compendium of economic solutions , Putting People First , a task that required him to ride herd on a disparate group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for the deficit and the qualities to be Treasury Secretary . <P> Begala recalls screaming at Stephanopoulos not to allow network star Ted Koppel onto the plane to do a special on the campaign 's last 48 hours , since it would n't air until after the election . " But George 's argument was that when you see Clinton unhandled and unproduced , people like him . And he was thinking down the road . That 's my definition of vision : anybody who can think beyond Election Day . " <P> With an intellect unencumbered by a comparable ego , Stephanopoulos was able to bridge the chasm separating the campaign 's often mismatched personalities . He made sure that Hollywood 's laid-back producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , who made the convention bio-film , was on speaking terms with chain-smoking , laser-intense Grunwald ; he doled out face time on television among aspiring talking heads ; not least , he soothed the brilliant , tightly coiled gonzo strategist James Carville by watching infomercials and Julia Child with him when Carville was too nervous to work .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
