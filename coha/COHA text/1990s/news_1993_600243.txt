<p> Big changes in the way hospitals and other health-care providers do business have been coming for years . This week , there came clear evidence of what those changes will do to the operations and earnings of medical-products suppliers . <p> U.S. Surgical stock fell 15 1/4 to $ 31 3/8 Thursday after the company said late Wednesday that measures hospitals are taking to make inventories more efficient will cause this year 's earnings to be below last year 's . That shocked investors who had seen the surgical-equipment maker 's earnings soar 47% in 1990 , 78% in 1991 and 48% last year . Other health-care stocks , star performers in the ' 80s and early ' 90s , also are plunging again . That 's even though worried investors already had pushed those stocks far below 1992 peak prices . <p> An unprecedented combination of public and private pressures are creating turmoil in the health-services industry , hurting medical suppliers like U.S. Surgical , drug companies , insurers and many others . <p> Hillary Rodham Clinton 's task force on health-care reform will make its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to recommend sweeping changes in the health-care system in an attempt to control costs and increase access to high-quality care . <p> Hospitals have seen change coming since the mid- ' 80s , when the federal government put limits on fees paid to doctors and hospitals by Medicare . Attempts to cut costs began to accelerate 18 months ago . That 's when managed-care programs designed to hold down employer health-care costs began to dominate the health-insurance market . The past six months , Clinton 's interest in making health-care reform a priority has added more urgency to hospital cost cutting . <p> " There is a trickle-down effect from the changes in the structure of the insurance industry , " says William Boyles , editor and publisher of the Health Market Survey newsletter . " Eventually , it hits hospital managers and medical staffs and there may be an avalanche effect now that market share has gone beyond 50% for managed care . " Among the cost-cutting measures : Just-in-time inventory procedures . Some hospitals are borrowing that inventory technique from the auto industry and other manufacturers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some thought carrying lots of inventory could save them money by allowing them to buy in bulk . <p> Now " our objectives are focused on reducing our inventory levels , " says Randy Smith , executive vice president for operations of American Medical Holdings , which runs 35 hospitals from California to Florida . " It 's more cost-effective not to have your cash tied up in inventories . " <p> Alternatives to surgery and less-invasive procedures . Douglas Goldstein of Medical Alliances , a hospital-and-physician management-consulting firm , says physicians today are more likely to question the need for coronary-bypass surgery . Some patients can be treated through changes in diet and exercise . Similar questions are being raised about hysterectomies and Caesarean sections . <p> A move to reuseable medical products . That goes for everything from gowns to surgical instruments . " For some procedures , it is much more cost-effective to use reuseables instead of continuing to buy disposables at current prices , " says Smith . Reuseable products also help reduce medical waste , which is becoming more expensive to dispose of as landfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in attitude at hospitals that hurts U.S. Surgical , which makes disposable surgical equipment . " There are studies being done all over the United States that show clearly that reuseables cost as much or more as single-use when you take all the factors into consideration , " argues U.S. Surgical CEO Leon Hirsch . <p> Investors do n't know who to believe . So many are getting out of the stocks . " There 's a cloud hanging over the medical-products industry because of uncertainty , " says Evan Sturza , editor of Sturza 's Medical Investment Letter . " People are assuming the worst until they see the plan . The attitude is to sell first and ask questions later . " <p> Whatever the outcome of health-care reform , stock analysts say there 's little chance health-care stocks will become investor favorites again soon . During the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , medical stocks soared . Investors bought them , noting that the USA 's fastest-growing population segment was the elderly , who need more medical attention than other age groups . There seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Biotechnology companies were coming out with promising technology for drugs to treat cancer , AIDS and other diseases . The question was not if there would be a new wonder drug , but which company would discover it first . <p> Medical-product makers , including drug companies , reported big earnings gains year after year . Merck 's earnings per share jumped 37% in 1988 , 24% in 1989 and 21% in 1990 . Earnings gains supported stock gains . U.S. Surgical surged from $ 13 in 1989 to as high as $ 134 1/2 early last year . <p> Since then , investors began to worry that U.S. Surgical and other companies could n't keep growing so fast . U.S. Surgical fell back to $ 100 . Clinton 's election and the onrush of health-care reform knocked it to the low $ 50s before this week 's slide . <p> Nobody expects these medical-products suppliers to go out of business . Most will remain solidly profitable . So are the stocks now great buys for investors ? <p> Many stock analysts say no . Earnings could fall this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be much slower at almost all health-care companies , analysts say . Dan Lamaitre , analyst at Cowen &; Co. , says it will be a while before investors fully realize the difficulty ahead . Of the stages of a drop-off in business - realization that demand is off , a working off of inventories by customers , followed by a price war among suppliers - health-care companies now are early in the first phase . " You have to realize this is not going to be a one-quarter phenomenon , " he says . As for the stocks , " there 's no reason to rush in . There are a lot of people looking to sell . " <p> Some analysts think the group should be outright avoided . " I believe this quarter has been a peak in earnings growth , and there is potential for a very difficult period the next year or two , and maybe even down earnings , " says Ruth Alon , analyst at Kidder Peabody .
