<p> Gift-shopping the week before Christmas can be enough to make one rethink whether it really is better to give . <p> But do n't tell that to Kathleen K. Reardon . For her , choosing just the right gift is a year-round undertaking  --  an around-the-world one for that matter . <p> That 's because Reardon 's expertise is sensitizing people to the art of global gift-giving . And in a small world where big cultural and religious differences can make even an innocently inappropriate gift nearly unforgivable , that 's not easy . Still , Reardon has made her presents known . <p> " We always think that we do n't have any oddities with regard to gift preferences , but when you think of it , we all have customs , if not rules , about giving and receiving , " says the professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California School of Business , in Los Angeles . <p> For 10 years , Reardon has investigated gift etiquette in other countries and cultures . She has advised international corporations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She conducted research sponsored by Parker Pen Co. on how to avoid implications of bribery and assure positive feelings in giving presents to foreigners . She has written a book , " Gift Giving Around the World " ( Passepartout , $ 9.95 ) , and is completing another that will include the findings of two current studies she 's conducting . During all of this , Reardon has come to this conclusion about cross-cultural gift-giving : " It is an awkward thing . It is very touchy . " <p> Reardon also collects horror stories to illustrate just how the best intentions can produce the worst outcomes . One American corporate executive , she recalls , had nurtured a trusted business relationship with a Chinese family over many years . When a daughter in the family was about to be married , he carefully chose a beautiful clock and sent it to her . By Chinese standards , his choice had n't been careful at all . <p> " The word for clock in Chinese is similar to their word for a pre-funeral visit to the dying person , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... A clock is associated with death or termination of a relationship , so giving it as a wedding gift was worse than if he 'd given it in almost any other circumstances . " <p> To save face for their daughter , the father and mother of the bride immediately sent the executive the equivalent of a dollar in Chinese currency " as a way of buying the clock to offset the negative implication , " explains Reardon . " But they never did business with him again . " <p> Once , while in France , an acquaintance aware of her research showed Reardon a vase prominently positioned in his house . The vase , he told her , was a gift from an American friend " and I abhor it . " <p> She asked why he displayed it so nicely . " My friend visits me regularly , " lamented the Frenchman . " I hate to say it , but it is a constant reminder of his bad taste . " <p> Besides flowers ( a must for any dinner guest to bring to a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people of other cultures  --  and particularly to the French , who are proud of their artistic history . " People 's homes are their castles , " she says , " so it 's best , unless they have shown a specific preference , like for Baccarat or Remington , to stay away from decorating gifts . " <p> But Reardon does n't want people to become paranoid about gift-giving across cultural lines  --  just aware . She knows of no country , religion or culture where a gift offends the recipient  --  so long as it is a proper one . And , as cultures come into greater contact and understand each other better , reasonable tolerance for a neatly wrapped faux pas increases . " You do n't have to be traumatized by this , " she says . " You just need to be sensitive to it . These are generalizations about other cultures that are not etched in stone . " Among her observations about other cultures : <p> Because the Japanese are a ceremonious people , gifts are important . " They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it is not appropriate to give a gift of significantly greater value than the gift you have received . You 're just obligating them to reciprocate . Sometimes the gifts they give are not expensive , just tokens of their appreciation . I 've heard people ask , ' Why did he bother giving me this plastic pen ? ' The process of gift-giving for them shows high regard . " <p> It 's also best to present a gift when alone with the recipient , she warns , unless you have gifts for everyone else . Consumables such as top-label liquors ( scotch but not bourbon ) and fine candies are appreciated . So are small conversation pieces , books and the latest rage in American toys for the children . <p> Wrapping also can be tricky . Simple is best . Red paper is associated with good health , and plain rice paper is considered in good taste , but nix the bold colors and save the black and white combinations for funerals . Also pass up the ribbons and bows . " And do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . <p> While Arab nations differ greatly , they share some guidelines in gift-giving . Like the Japanese , reciprocity counts for much , so if given a gift , you are obliged to give one . Unlike the Japanese , Arabs tend to give lavishly . Another rule : " Do n't admire an object of theirs openly because they will feel obligated to give it to you , " says Reardon . " That 's good to keep in mind in many cultures . " <p> For specific gifts : Never liquor , which is taboo in the Islamic religion . Logo or designer-name gifts are n't recommended unless they have unique significance in the relationship . Forget the meaningless gadgets as well . " Intellectual gifts are appreciated , such as a book , " advises Reardon . But avoid merchandise that depicts animals , since some of them symbolize bad luck . <p> Warning : " It is inappropriate in some Arab cultures even to ask about the wife , " says Reardon . " Then , on top of it , to bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For Latin Americans , " says Reardon , " you do n't want to give knives or handkerchiefs . " Knives imply cutting off of relationships and hankies , tears . The colors black and purple are associated with Lent and should be avoided . So should the number 13 . <p> " Something for the entire family is best , " says Reardon , who describes Latin Americans as openly family-oriented . " Artwork from North America , the latest toys from the United States for their children , but nothing too expensive . ... Thoughtfulness is what counts , and not the expense of the item . " <p> " The people closest to us in gift-giving are the British , " says Reardon . " For them , entertainment is the primary means of showing appreciation . So if your friend or colleague is from Great Britain , provide him with maybe a small gift  --  not personal , something representative of your hometown or a photo or special candy  --  and dinner . " <p> For continental Europe , the rules differ nation by nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Western European countries , " says Reardon . Germans appreciate silver items , especially if you stay in their home . Perfume for women is too personal . Fancy chocolates and liquors work . <p> " When giving to people from China and from most Asian countries , do n't make a big deal about your gift , " says Reardon . Underplay the significance of the gift , saying it is a token of your regard or esteem . " From their earliest birthday parties on , Americans open a gift and everybody oohs and ahhs and touches it and comments on it , but this is n't appropriate in Asia . " <p> To be safe in most regions of the world , Reardon advises a gift of thought over a gift of great expense . Invariably a good gift , she says , is a photo of the recipient while visiting or accompanying you on a special occasion , placed in an attractive frame . " Even though you might spend a fair amount of money on the frame , it does n't stand out because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's an especially appropriate gift if you have the frame engraved with the date and , on the back , a little note that commemorates the occasion . " <p> Another safe gift that travels well is a picture book representing the United States , or the specific region of the country you 're from . " In a card , if possible , link the meaning of that gift to the beginning of your relationship to make it personal . <p> " But what usually really counts to that person is that you show high regard for his country and culture .
