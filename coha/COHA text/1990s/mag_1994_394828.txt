They thought it might be impossible , perhaps difficult at best . But when the 23 major fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 started smashing into Jupiter 's clouds , it was easy . Backyard astronomers all around the world armed with telescopes as small as two inches in aperture watched Jupiter as it accumulated bruises . It was the week of July 16-22 , 1994 , and it was a week astronomers will not forget for a long time to come . As the national media focused on the latest explosive results and scientists sat glued to each morning 's press conference , amateur astronomers delighted at simply soaking in the views of Jupiter 's southern hemisphere and recording it on film , with paper and pencil and through electronic CCD cameras and image-processing software . The planet was high in the sky as the sky began to darken each night and remained above the horizon for several hours before setting in the west . All of the strikes occurred out of view from Earth but the planet 's rapid rotation carried them into view after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before rotating out of view . As more and more pieces of the comet struck the same latitude but different longitudes of Jupiter 's southern hemisphere , a game evolved of attempting to keep the spots straight . After a few days , as the spots changed their appearance and new spots appeared , it became difficult to keep them sorted out . But such trivial problems did n't enter the mind at the outset . Some viewers even tried to spot Jupiter and its cloud damage in the daytime . From Miami , Florida , Jeffrey D. Beish and Carlos E. Hernandez filed the first amateur observation of the spot created by fragment A at 7:35 p.m . EDT on July 16 , less than four hours after the impact . Beish , Hernandez , and Donald C. Parker of nearby Coral Gables are Mars Recorders for the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers , and they produced some of the finest eyepiece drawings ( Beish and Hernandez ) and CCD images ( Parker ) of the comet crash sites ( see pages 70 , 71 , 76 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made with a 16-inch f/7 reflector at 225x and 382x , Beish and Hernandez say the spot " appeared as a dark , crescent-shaped albedo feature at the southern border of the South South Temperate Belt and within the South South Temperate Zone . A dark ray system preceded the spot as it rotated and a pair of small , bright ovals followed it . " Beish and Hernandez were the first among thousands who saw the A spot and others that followed . Along with almost all backyard observers who had a clear sky , I ventured out and trained an 8-inch SCT on Jupiter . After swatting a mosquito and focusing carefully , I saw two dark blotches , A and E , plain as day . It was incredible  --  here was an event of historic proportions that failed to fizzle . On July 19 Ralph E. Mackenstein of Seymour , Connecticut , found the spots easily visible in a 60mm refractor at 72x . " The only Jovian features I could see were the two belts , the northern one being darker , and the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots located near each other were the most conspicuous features on the planet . " " What a surprise it was to see that first inky black spot , " says Charles Manion of Owensboro , Kentucky . " On July 18 , from 9 to 11 p.m . CDT , I continued to watch it slowly move across the face of Jupiter . It was an incredible sight . " Robert Royce of Northford , Connecticut , sketched the planet with a 10-inch f/25 Gregorian reflector . " I was amazed to see two of the spots , U and G , displaying a significant smearing . The spots spread out into pancake-shaped areas by July 21 , " he says . Jeff Jones of Hewitt , Texas , observed the planet for three nights before spotting a crash site . " In my 60mm refractor I was able to see two spots on July 19 , " he says . " They appeared as red-brown holes in the planet 's glowing clouds , and I later discovered they were impact sites G and L. " Despite high clouds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.S. Virgin Islands , observed the spots from his beachfront condo using a 6-inch reflector . " The spots were incredibly black , " he says , " like the shadows from a Jovian moon transiting the planet 's cloudtops . " And the Jupiter watch goes on . In mid-August many of the spots remained prominently visible , and astronomers expected them to remain so for weeks or months to come . While they are continuing to watch the zones of destruction , backyard astronomers are already filing their fond memories of the central week of the event . Says Randy Pakan , an observer in Edmonton , Alberta , " This event has done more for us than a dozen Halley 's Comets ! " What great , unexpected event lurks out in the distant solar system now ? A bright comet ? A Leonid meteor storm ? We can only wait and watch and hope , content for having seen this rare and spectacular death of a wayward comet . <p>                 @ @ @ @
