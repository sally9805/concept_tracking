Seattle , schmattle . Try to convince a Louisianian that the Northwestern city woke the rest of the country to the delights of coffee and you 'll get laughs between sips of Southern brew as stout and rich as its heritage . The craze may have whooshed into Seattle like an espresso machine in the last couple of decades , but it 's dripped steadily into the New Orleans culture for nearly 300 years . French immigrants brought their coffee traditions to the city in the early 1700s , and by the turn of the next century , New Orleans had so much of the bean delivered to its port that the wharf area became " Coffee Row . " ( Today it 's the country 's number one importer , surpassing both New York and San Francisco . ) Cafe Du Monde  --  the famous all-day , all-night eatery serving beignets ( fried , powdered sugar dusted , square doughnuts ) and cafe au lait ( half coffee , half scalded milk )  --  started more than a century ago . You want to challenge that Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourmet coffee craze ? Well , Antoine 's restaurant in New Orleans took plain coffee a few steps further in the mid1800s with its cafe brulot ( coffee with spices , orange and lemon peel , and brandy ) , always flamed tableside , often spectacularly poured onto the tablecloth and torched . You can still experience that tradition today . ( Ask for that at Starbucks . ) Seattle may deserve accolades for recent revived in terest in the perky beverage , and even New Orleans has reacted with a surge of new coffeehouses . With these additions , the city is up to about 60 now . We recently spent a couple of days poking into as many as possible , switching to decaf as needed . Here are a few of our finds . I started one morning at True Brew . It 's quiet except for the occasional espresso machine burst and floating classical music . As I took on a massive cinnamon roll and " coffee of the day , " a locksmith hunched over his own breakfast , a professor tapped away on a laptop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cups at an outdoor table big enough to shade the dog beneath . Evenings , the place gets more lively . The tiny in-house theater offers entertainment five nights a week , and the bar pours wines and liqueurs as well as java . // <p>
