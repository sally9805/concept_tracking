The motto of the FBI is " Fidelity , Bravery , Integrity . " How well did William Sessions ' all-powerful predecessor , J. Edgar Hoover , uphold these words ? Not very , according to a just published biography of the late FBI chief . Anthony Summers ' Official and Confidential : The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover is sure to disturb the old crime fighter 's final rest . <P> Even as he railed against gays as " sexual deviants , " Hoover apparently struggled with his own homosexuality . Summers offers fresh details of Hoover 's 40-year friendship with Clyde Tolson , a handsome young agent he plucked out of the rank and file and quickly promoted to assistant director . The pair ate dinner together almost every night and vacationed together every year ; Summers contends that Luisa Stuart , a former fashion model , once saw them holding hands in the back seat of a limo . According to Summers , the Mafia claimed to have the goods on Edgar and Clyde , including compromising photographs of the two men engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackmail material . It protected gangsters like Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello from FBI scrutiny for more than 20 years and forced Hoover to insist that syndicated crime was not a national problem . <P> Perhaps Summers ' most bizarre revelation is an account provided by Susan Rosenstiel , the wife of a liquor distiller and gambling crony . Rosenstiel recalls attending what she thought would be an elegant private party at New York City 's Plaza Hotel in the company of lawyer Roy Cohn , Hoover and others . Instead , Cohn introduced Rosenstiel to a woman named " Mary , " dressed in a fluffy black dress , lace stockings and high heels . It was obvious Mary was no woman . " You could see where he shaved . It was Hoover , " said Rosenstiel . Joined by Cohn , Hoover stripped down to a tiny garter belt and proceeded to have sex with two young boys . Cohn later joked about the evening . " That was really something , was n't it , with Mary Hoover ? " <P> Hoover 's presidential snooping included efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most famously , with eavesdropping on J.F.K. frolicking with Mafia moll Judith Campbell and Marilyn Monroe . <P> " We had to be not only as straight as an arrow , " recalled a former agent last week on PBS 's Frontline . " We had to give every perception that we were straight as arrows . " In 1972 , at age 77 , the omnipotent FBI chief became the first civil servant to be granted a state funeral , at which he was eulogized by Richard Nixon in the Rotunda of the Capitol as " one of the giants . . . a national symbol of courage , patriotism and granite-like honesty and integrity . " But the year before , bedeviled by fallout from his efforts to tap the phones of journalists , the President had confided to John Ehrlichman , " We may have on our hands here a man who will pull the temple down with him , including me . " It is not surprising that not one of the eight Presidents he served dared fire him .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
