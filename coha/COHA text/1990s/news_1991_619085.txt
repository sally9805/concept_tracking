Proposed in 1904 to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal , then interrupted by the 1906 earthquake , the Exposition , the authors say , was rebuilt and refinanced for $ 15 million .

" <p> So writes Patrick McGrew in " LANDMARKS OF SAN FRANCISCO " ( Harry N. Abrams ; 304 pages ; $ 49.50 ) , an eclectic mix of color and black-and-white photos of familiar but unique buildings that make our city so beautiful . You can expect old favorites such as the Palace of Fine Arts , Hibernia Bank , Mission Dolores , the Flatiron Building and Trinity Episcopal Church , but the lesser- knowns are what make this book so fascinating  --  the Empire Malt House in North Beach , for example , and the Campfire Girls Building on Arguello , the Refugee Shack on 24th Avenue , the Chinatown YWCA and the South San Francisco Opera House , which , with typical San Francisco eccentricity , " is not located in South San Francisco and is not an Opera House .

' " That 's the 1876-1917 period when , as Bogart explains , the American rich indulged themselves with $ 100,000 railroad cars and $ 50,000 bathtubs . Out of it came the Carolands Chateau in Hillsborough , a magnificent estate built for Harriet Pullman Carolan by Willis Polk in 1914 after the 1665 design of the Chateau Guiry-en-Vexin in Paris .
