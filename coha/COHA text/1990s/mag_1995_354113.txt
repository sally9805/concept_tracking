MOST YOUNG CHILDREN LIKE TO play dress-up , parading around the house in their dad 's wing tips or smearing their mom 's lipstick all over their face . But for a few youngsters , usually boys , this childhood rite is more than a game . They are obsessed with their mother 's clothes and wear them at every opportunity . It is as if a part of their mind were trying to erase the maleness of their body and allow an inherent femaleness to emerge . As they grow older , their discomfort with their gender often increases , until finally they turn to doctors for help . Some take feminizing hormones to grow breasts . Some even have their sex organs surgically altered so they can live completely  --  including anatomically  --  as women . <P> But are such people , who are known as transsexuals , truly women trapped in men 's bodies ? For years , scientists searched for but never found any measurable differences between most men and the ones who become transsexuals , whether in the level of hormones , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did scientists find any fundamental similarities between transsexuals and women . <P> Last week , however , investigators from the Netherlands Institute for Brain Research in Amsterdam reported preliminary evidence that transsexuals may be inherently different , after all . Their study of six male-to-female transsexuals showed that a tiny structure deep within a part of the brain that controls sexual function appeared to be more like the type found in women than that found in men . If confirmed , the study seems likely to challenge long-held beliefs about what it takes to make someone a man  --  or , a woman . <P> The Dutch research is part of a growing body of evidence suggesting that nature is just as important as nurture in determining how we think and behave as sexual beings . Neurobiologists have cataloged apparent differences in the way men 's and women 's brains process information and interpret facial expressions . Geneticists have begun sifting through tantalizing clues that sexual orientation  --  as opposed to sexual identity  --  may at least be partly inherited ( see box ) . Yet the subject matter is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evaluating all the various claims dispassionately can be very difficult . <P> In many respects , studying transsexuals would seem to be the most difficult undertaking of all . Not to be confused with transvestites or cross dressers , true transsexuals are rare . By some estimates , no more than 1 person in 350,000 believes he or she was born the wrong gender . Moreover , the portion of the brain that seems to be different in transsexuals is smaller than a pinhead . Even advanced imaging techniques , like the pet scan or mri , can not detect such tiny variations . To do their research , the Dutch team , led by Dr. Dick Swaab , had to dissect the brains of transsexuals in autopsies and examine them under a microscope . Little wonder , then , that it took Swaab 's team 11 years to find transsexual candidates , persuade them to donate their brains and then wait for them to die to make the comparisons .                    @
