Chapter One&lt; Only the most discerning observer can sense the deep , hidden places in the sea of another 's life . And only the unwary or the truly brave dare to look into those secrect depths .  --  " On the Way of Water , " from the journal of Hayden Stone He waited deep in the shadows at the back of the poorly lit shop , a patient spider crouched motionless in his web . There was something about the very stillness emanating from him that made Charity believe he would wait as long as necessary for his prey to venture too close . " Mr. Winters ? " Charity hesitated in the open doorway , clipboard in hand , and peered into the gloom interior of Charms &; Virtues . " Ms. Truitt . " Elias Winters 's voice came out of the darkness behind the cash register counter . " Please come in . I had a feeling you might show up sooner or later . " He had spoken softly from the far end of the cavernous old wharf warehouse , but Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alarm went through her . His voice was as deep as the sea , and it beckoned her with the same dangerous allure . She took a cautious step through the doorway and tried to shake off the strange mix of wariness and excitement that gripped her . She was here on business , she reminded herself . " Sorry to bother you , " she said briskly . " It 's not a problem . " " I 'm the owner of Whispers , the bookshop at the other end of the pier . " " I know . " An extraordinary quality underlay the very ordinary words . Charity had the feeling that she was being summoned . Uncertainty made her pause . When in doubt go into full executive mode , she told herself . She had been out of the intense , competitive corporate world for a year , but she could still tap the old skills when she needed them . The important thing was to take charge immediately . She cleared her throat . " As the President of the Crazy Otis Landing Shopkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to our little group , " she said . " Thank you . " Elias Winters did not sound particularly impressed . On the other hand , he did not sound unimpressed , either . There was something unnaturally calm about that dark , velvety voice . She wondered if he was tanked to the gills on tranquilizers and then decided that was highly improbable . No one who was stuffed full of sedatives could have managed to infuse so much subtle power into such softly spoken words . She took a step closer . A floorboard creaked . The gentle lapping of the waves beneath the aging pier clearly audible in the solemn quiet . Another step produced a ghostly moan from a protesting timber . Dust motes danced in the air . Whenever she entered Charms &; Virtues , she thought of haunted houses and old cemeteries . As she had occasionally pointed out to the previous owner , Hayden Stone , a little dusting and some decent lighting would do wonders for the place . Elias stood , unmoving , behind the counter . He was cloaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little slits of windows located high on the walls . She could not make out his face . In fact , she could barely distinguish him from the looming bulk of the antique fortune-telling machine positioned just behind the counter . Elias Winters had opened the doors of Charms &; Virtues three days ago on Monday , the first day of August . Thus far she had caught only brief glimpses of him as he came and went down the central walkway between the pier shops . She had been left with disturbing images that intrigued her and aroused her curiosity . For some reason she was pleased that he was not too tall , just under six feet . A rather nice height for a man , Charity reflected . He was not built like a side of beef , either . There was , however , a disturbing aura of elegant , lean strength about him . He did not walk , he paced . Each time she had seen him he had been wearing a dark , long-sleeved pullover and a pair of jeans anchored at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His nearly black hair was a little too long for a man who appeared to be in his mid-thirties . Yesterday Charity had assigned her counter assistant , Newlin Odell , the task of foisting off Hayden Stone 's obnoxious parrot , Crazy Otis , on the new owner of Charms &; Virtues . The excuse she had instructed Newlin to give to the unsuspecting Winters was that Crazy Otis missed his old , familiar surroundings . It was true , as far as it went . Otis had fallen into a serious depression when Hayden had failed to return from his last trip to Seattle . It was Charity who had nursed the ungrateful bird through the trauma . She had held her breath while Newlin ambled down the length of the pier to deliver Crazy Otis and his cage . She had fully expected that Elias would refuse to accept the responsibility . But to her unmitigated relief , Newlin had returned empty-handed . Newlin 's only comment on Elias was that he was " kinda strange . " Newlin tended to be a young man of few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd also like to talk to you about some business matters that concern all of us here on the Landing , " Charity continued crisply . " Would you like a cup of tea ? " " Tea ? " " I just made a pot . " Elias set two round , handleless cups on the grimy counter . " A very fine grade of China keemun . The Abberwick Tea &; Spice shop in Seattle imports it especially for me . " " I see . " Charity did not know any men who drank tea . All the men she knew in Seattle were into espressos and lattes . Here in Whispering Waters Cove , they tended to favor plain coffee . Or at least they had until Bea Hatfield , owner of the caf a few doors down on the pier , had installed the town 's first espresso machine three months ago . " Yes . Thanks . I 'd appreciate a cup . " " Please come back here and join me . " The deep voice echoed in the cavelike surroundings . Feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her way through the cluttered shop . Elias seemed to be alone . She glanced around to be certain , but there definitely were no customers to disturb the tomb-silent atmosphere . She frowned . This was just the way things had been when Hayden Stone had run Charms &; Virtues . The curiosity shop had been closed since Hayden 's death two months ago . Hayden had been away in Seattle when he had collapsed from a heart attack . A quiet funeral had been arranged by some unknown associate in the city . It had all been over before Charity or any of the other shopkeepers on the Landing had even learned of their odd landlord 's demise . There was no question but that Hayden would be missed by the Crazy Otis Landing crowd . He had been a little strange , but he had also been a sympathetic landlord . No one had ever gotten to know him well . Hayden had lived in his own world , detached and remote from those around him , but he had never been rude or unfriendly . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had precipitated a potential financial catastrophe for the shopkeepers of the Pier , however . The threat had roused Charity 's executive instincts , which had lain dormant for months . Like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon , she had shaken out her wings and allowed them to dry in the sun . She was determined to head off disaster before it overtook her newfound friends . Her plans required that the shop owners form a united front . That meant that the new proprietor of Charms &; Virtues had to be convinced to get with the program . She went forward determinedly between the aisles formed by the sagging , disorganized counters . What little summer sunlight managed to filter into the room through the high , narrow windows was dimmed by the years of grime on the glass . Charity wrinkled her nose at the sight of the heavy shroud of dust that covered the assortment of bizarre goods heaped on the display tables . She was dismayed to see that the new proprietor had made no effort to tidy the premises . The goods were still stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the displays . Odd little carvings were piled high in one corner . A jumble of brass bells and whistles overflowed a nearby packing crate . Small , colorfully dressed dolls with exotic faces painted with startlingly grim expressions tumbled from a box . Plastic masks leered down from the walls . Below was a counter laden with invisible-ink pens , little magic smoke-producing tubes , and puzzles composed of interlocking metal rings . And so it went throughout the shop . Oddities and imports from far-off lands filled the shelves of Charms &; Virtues . Handwoven straw baskets from the Philippines sat next to a hoard of mechanical toy insects manufactured in Hong Kong . Miniature plastic dinosaurs made in Southeast Asia occupied shelf space with rubber worms produced in Mexico . Cheap bracelets , music boxes , imitation military medals , and artificial flowers littered the countertops . Most of it looked as if it had been sitting in the same spot for years . The wares sold in the dusty import shop could be described in a single word so far as Charity was concerned . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply some energy and enthusiasm if he wanted tar revive his newly purchased small business . She made a mental note to present him a feather duster as a welcome gift . Perhaps he would take the hint . Charity had never figured out just how Hayden Stone had managed to make a living from Charms &; Virtues , or the pier rents , for that matter . He had lived a life of stark simplicity , but even eccentrics had to pay real estate taxes and buy food . She had finally concluded that he 'd had a private income from some other source . " I do n't have any milk or sugar , " Elias said . " That 's all right , " Charity said hastily . " I do n't take anything in my tea . " " Neither do I. Good tea should be as clear as a pool of pure water . " The comment brought back memories . " Hayden Stone used to say the same thing . " " Did he ? " " Yes . He was always muttering weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know , Zen-like . He once told me that he was a student of some sort of ancient philosophy that had been forgotten by almost everyone . He said there was only one other person he knew who also studied it . " " Hayden was more than a student . He was a master . " " You knew him ? " " Yes . " " I see . " Charity forced herself to a more confident pace . She held her clipboard in front of her as though it were a talisman and summoned up what she hoped was a bright smile . " Well , on to business . I realize that you have n't had a chance to get settled here on the Landing , but unfortunately the lease problem ca n't wait . " " Lease problem ? " " The shopkeepers have decided to band together as a group to deal with our new landlord , Far Seas , Incorporated . We 'd like you to join us , We 'll have a great deal more negotiating power if we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple brown teapot with a curiously precise but fluid motion . " What do you intend to approach Far Seas about ? " " Renewing our leases . " Charity watched , fascinated , as Elias poured tea . " As you no doubt know , this pier was owned , lock , stock , and barrel , by Hayden Stone , the former proprietor of this shop . " " I 'm aware of that . " A muted shaft of sunshine from one of the ceiling-high windows slanted briefly across the right side of Elias 's face . It revealed a bold , hawklike nose and savage cheekbones . Charity drew a deep breath and tightened her grip on the clipboard . " From what we can gather , at the time of Hayden 's death , the ownership of the Landing was transferred automatically to a company called Far Seas , Incorporated . " A low hiss interrupted Charity before she could continue . It was a familiar sound . She spared a brief glance for the large , brilliantly plumed parrot that was perched arrogantly atop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , Otis , " Charity said . Crazy Otis shifted from one clawed foot to the other and lowered his head with a menacing movement . His beady eyes glittered with malice . " Heh , heh , heh . " Elias examined the bird with interest . " I sense some hostility here . " " He always acts like that . " Charity made a face . " He knows it irritates me . And after all I 've done for him , too . You 'd think that bird would show some gratitude . " Otis cackled again . " I took him in after Hayden died , you know , " Charity explained . " He was extremely depressed . Moped around , let his feathers go , lost his appetite . It was terrible . He was in such bad shape I was afraid to leave him alone . During the day he sat on the coatrack in my back room office . I kept his cage in my bedroom at night . " " I 'm sure he 's grateful , " Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . " That bird does n't know the meaning of the word . " Crazy Otis sidled along the tree limb , muttering with evil glee . " You do n't know how lucky you were , Otis , " Charity said . " No one else on the pier was willing to take charge of you . More than a couple of people suggested that we try to sell you to some unsuspecting tourist . And one individual , who shall go unnamed , wanted to call the pound and have you taken away . But I was too softhearted to allow that . I gave you shelter , food , free rides on Yappy 's carousel . What did I get in return ? Nothing but nasty complaints . " " Heh , heh , heh . " Otis flapped his clipped wings . " Take it easy , Otis . " Elias reached out with one long-fingered hand and scratched the bird 's head . " An obligation exists until it is repaid . You owe her . " Crazy Otis grumbled , but he stopped chortling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented stupor as Elias stroked his feathers . " Amazing , " Charity said . " The only other person that bird ever treated as an equal was Hayden Stone . Everyone else is just so much old newspaper beneath Crazy Otis 's grubby claws . " " Otis and I had a long talk after Newlin brought him over here yesterday , " Elias said . " He and I have decided that we can share this shop together . " " That 's a relief . To tell you the truth , when I sent Newlin down here with that nasty beast , I expected you to refuse to take him . In all fairness , Crazy Otis is n't your responsibility . Just because you took over Charms &; Virtues does n't mean you have to take charge of him . " Elias gave her a long , considering look . " Otis was n't your responsibility either , but you took him in and gave him a home for the past two months . " " There was n't much else I could do . Hayden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he was a little weird . " " The fact that you liked Hayden did n't mean that you had to take care of Otis . " " Unfortunately , it did . " Charity sighed . " Somehow , Crazy Otis has always seemed like one of the family here on the pier . A particularly unpleasant relative , I admit , one I 'd prefer to keep stashed out of sight in the attic , but , nevertheless , a relation . And you know what they say about your relations . You ca n't choose them . You have to take what you get . " " I understand . " Elias stopped rubbing Otis 's head and picked up the teapot again . " You do n't have to keep him , you know , " Charity said in a burst of rash honesty . " He 's not a very lovable bird . " " As you said , he 's family . " " Parrots like Otis have long life spans . You 'll be saddled with him for years . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheered by the fact that Elias was not going to change his mind on the subject . " Otis is settled . Now about this situation with Far Seas . " " Yes ? " " All of the rents on the pier are due to be renegotiated before the end of September . Today is the fourth of August . We 've got to act quickly . " " Just what action do you plan to take ? " Elias set down the teapot . " As I said , we want to approach Far Seas as a united front . " Charity realized with a start that she was staring at his hands . They were very interesting hands , powerful hands imbued with a striking , utterly masculine grace . " A united front ? " Elias watched her as she hurriedly raised her gaze from his hands to his face . " Right . United . " She noticed that his eyes were the color of the sea during a storm , a bleak , steel gray . Her fingers clenched around the clipboard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lock in long-term leases at reasonable rents before the corporation realizes what 's happening here in Whispering Waters Cove . " " What is happening here ? " Elias 's mouth curved faintly . " Aside from the impending arrival of our visitors from outer space ? " " I see you 've already met some of the Voyagers ? " " It 's a little hard to miss them on the street . " " True . " Charity shrugged . " They 're quite an embarrassment to the town council . Most of the members think the Voyagers give Whispering Waters Cove a bad image . But like the mayor says , one way or another , the cult should be gone by the middle of August . " " What happens then ? " " Have n't you heard ? " Charity grinned . " Gwendolyn Pitt , the leader of the group , has told her followers that the alien spaceships will arrive at midnight on the fifteenth to take them all away on an extended tour of the galaxy . During said tour , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophical enlightenment . " " I 've been told it 's difficult to mix the two . " " Yeah , well , evidently the aliens have mastered the problem . As you can imagine , the town council is hoping that when nothing happens that night , the Voyagers will figure out that the whole thing is a hoax and will leave Whispering Waters Cove bright and early on the morning of the sixteenth . " " In my experience people tend to cling to a belief even when they are confronted with clear evidence that it 's false . " " Well , it wo n't bother me or anyone else here on the pier if some of them decide to stay in the area , " Charity admitted . " Most of the Voyagers seem pleasant enough , if a little naive . A few have become good customers . I 've made a killing during the past two months with paranormal and New Age titles . " The long blue and white tunics and bright headbands worn by the members of the Voyagers cult had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt and her followers had arrived early in July . They had parked their motley assortment of trailers , motor homes , and campers on a patch of primeview land that had once been an old campground . The town 's mayor , Phyllis Dartmoor , had initially been as hostile toward the group as the council members , but after a short flurry of fruitless efforts to force the Voyagers out of town , she had become surprisingly sanguine about the situation . Whenever the local newspaper produced an editorial denouncing the newcomers as a blot on the landscape , she reminded everyone that the cult would likely disintegrate in the middle of August . " The Voyagers do add some local color , " Elias said as he handed Charity one of the small , handleless cups . " Yes , but they do n't enhance the new upscale image that the town is tying to create to draw tourists . " Charity took a sip of tea . The warm liquid rolled across her tongue , bright , subtle , and refreshing . She savored the feel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man did know his tea , she thought . " Like it ? " Elias watched her intently . " Very nice , " she said as she put the cup back down on the counter . " There is something very distinctive about keemun , is n't there ? " " Yes  --  , " " Well , back to business . Actually , it 's the town image thing that makes it necessary for those of us here on the pier to move quickly on the lease issue . " " Go on . " Elias sipped tea . " The mayor and town council would like to see this pier converted into a boutique art mall filled with cutesy shops and antique galleries . They want to attract high-end tenants . But in order to do that , they have to convince the owner of the landing to remove the current shopkeepers . We 're not exactly trendy , you see . " Elias glanced around at his own gloom-filled store . " I get the picture . And you think Far Seas will go along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course . Far Seas is a big corporation in Seattle . Its managers will be interested only in the bottom line . If they think they can lease these shops to a lot of upmarket art dealers who can afford sky-high rents , they 'll jump at the chance to get rid of us . Or , they may try to sell the landing itself . " " What do you know about Far Seas ? " " Not much , " Charity admitted . " Apparently it 's some kind of consulting firm involved with the Pacific Rim trade . A couple of weeks ago all of us here on the pier received a letter from Hayden Stone 's attorney instructing us to start paying our rents to Far Seas . " " Have you spoken to anyone at Far Seas ? " " Not yet . " Charity smiled grimly . " It 's a question of strategy . " " Strategy ? " " I decided it would be best to wait until the new owner of Charms &; Virtues arrived before we made our move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So at this point you 're operating on a lot of assumptions about Far Seas ? " The hint of criticism irritated her . " I think it 's safe to assume that Far Seas will react in the same way that any large company would in this situation . As the new owner of a piece of commercial real estate , the company will naturally want to get the highest possible rate of return . Or the best offer , if it chooses to sell the pier . " " When one studies an opponent 's reflection in a pool of water , one should take care to ensure that the water is very , very clear . " Charity eyed him uneasily . " That sounds like more of Hayden Stone 's old sayings . Were you a very close friend of his ? " " Yes . " " I suppose that 's why you got Charms &; Virtues ? " " Yes . " Elias 's eyes were unreadable . " It was his legacy to me . I also got his cottage . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , Mr. Winters , but you wo n't hang on to your legacy for long if we do n't get those leases renegotiated with Far Seas . We 've got to move fast now that you 're here . There 's a strong possibility that someone on the town council or Leighton Pitt , a local realtor , will contact Far Seas directly . " " Elias . " " What ? Oh , Elias . " She hesitated . " Please call me Charity . " " Charity . " He repeated her name the way he sipped tea , as if he were tasting it . " Unusual name these days . " " You do n't meet a lot of people named Elias , either , " she retorted . " Now , then , if you 'll just give me a few minutes to explain our plans for dealing with Far Seas , I 'm sure you 'll see how important it is for you to join with us . " " Yes . " " I beg your pardon ? " Elias raised one shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of Charms &; Virtues , I see the importance of joining with you in your what did you call it ? Ah , yes . Your united front . I 've never been part of a united front before . How does it work ? She smiled with satisfaction . " It 's quite simple , really . I 'm the president of the shopkeepers association , so I 'll do the actual negotiating with Far Seas . " " Have you had much experience with this kind of thing ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact , I have . I was in the corporate world before I moved here to Whispering Waters Cove . " " Charity Truitt . " Recognition gleamed in the depths of Elias 's eyes . " I thought the name sounded familiar . Would that be the department-store Truitts of Seattle ? " " Yes . " Charity 's spine stiffened in automatic reflex . " And before you say anything else , let me answer all your questions in three sentences . Yes , I 'm the former president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now running the business . And , yes , I intend to remain here in Whispering Waters Cove . " " I see . " " While I am no longer involved in the operation of Truitt department stores , I have n't forgotten everything I learned during the years I ran the company . If your rsum is stronger than mine , I 'll be glad to turn the job of confronting Far Seas over to you . " " I 'm satisfied that you 're the best person for the task , " he said gently . Chagrined , Charity set the clipboard down on the counter . " Sorry to sound so belligerent . It 's just that my decision to leave Truitt last summer was , uh , complicated and difficult . " " I see . " She studied him closely , but she could not tell if he had heard the rumors of a broken engagement and a nervous breakdown . She concluded that he had not . He showed no signs of curiosity or concern . But , then , he showed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to plunge ahead . " The pier is prime property , " she said . " We 're going to have to fight to keep our shops . " " Something tells me that you will be successful in renegotiating your leases . " " Thanks for the vote of confidence . " Charity glanced at Crazy Otis . " If I 'm not successful , we 're all going to be looking for new locations . And that includes you , Otis . " " Heh , heh , heh . " Otis slithered along the perch until he reached the far end . He stepped off the fake branch onto Elias 's shoulder . Charity winced , recalling the occasions when Otis had climbed onto her arm . Elias did not seem to notice the heavy claws sinking into his dark green pullover . " Another cup of tea ? " Elias asked . " No , thanks . " Charity glanced at her watch . " I 'm going to call Far Seas this afternoon and see if I can get the lease negotiations started today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in luck . " He looked thoughtful . " The stream flows inevitably into the river and then on into the sea . The water may take on different aspects at various points in its journey , but it is , nevertheless , the same water . " Newlin was right , Charity thought . Elias Winters was kind of strange . She smiled politely . " Fine . Wish me good karma or something . We 're all in this together , remember . If I do n't pull this off , everyone on this pier is going to be in trouble . " " You 'll pull it off . " " That 's the spirit . " Charity turned to go . Belatedly she recalled the other item on her agenda . " I almost forgot . The shopkeepers are having a potluck here on the pier Monday night after we close for the day . You 're invited , naturally  --  . " " Thank you " " You 'll come ? " " Yes . " " Good . Hayden never came to the potlucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We still need hot dishes . Can you manage an entre ? " " As long as no one minds if it does n't contain meat . " Charity laughed . " I was just about to tell you that a couple of us here on the pier are vegetarians . I think you 're going to fit in nicely . " " That would be a novel experience , " Elias said . Charity decided not to ask him to elaborate . Something told her she would not like the answer . Her comment had only been a polite , offhand remark . She doubted that Elias made those kinds of comments . She had the feeling that everything he said was laced with several layers of cryptic meaning . She 'd had the same sensation whenever she talked to Hayden Stone . It did not make for a lot of comfortable , casual conversation . Charity experienced a surge of relief as she walked quickly out of the dark confines of Charms &; Virtue into the sunlight . She hurried down the wide corridor between the shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odell looked up from a bundle of weekly news magazines that he was placing on a rack . His thin features were pinched in the expression of someone who had just recently returned from a funeral . For Newlin , that was normal . He was a skinny young man of twenty-four . His narrow face was partially obscured by a scruffy goatee and a pair of wire-framed glasses . Charity was almost certain that he trimmed his lanky brown hair himself . It hung in uneven hunks around his ears . " How 'd it go ? " Newlin asked in his blunt , economical fashion . Charity paused in the doorway of her small office , aware of a familiar wave of sympathy for Newlin . She had hired him a month ago when he had shown up out of nowhere to ask for a job . He had come to Whispering Waters Cove to be near his girlfriend , a young woman named Arlene Fenton , who had joined the Voyagers . He spent the time that he was not working at Whispers trying to coax Arlene away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed in his mission to talk sense into Arlene , Newlin had stoically determined to wait out the situation . He hoped that on the fifteenth of August Arlene would finally understand that she had been taken in by a scam . Charity sincerely hoped that he was right . She found his devotion to Arlene heartwarming and quixotic in an old-fashioned , heroic sense . But she secretly worried about what would happen if Arlene did not come to her senses at midnight that night . Having nursed a depressed parrot for two months , she was not eager to deal with a stricken Newlin Odell . " You were right , Newlin , " Charity said . " Elias Winters is kind of strange . He was a friend of Hayden Stone 's , so I guess that explains it . But the good news is that he 's willing to go along with the rest of the shopkeepers in order to negotiate the new leases . " " You gon na call Far Seas ? " " Right away . Cross your fingers . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into giving you a break on the leases if Pitt or the town council has already gotten to ' em and convinced ' em that the pier is valuable real estate . " " Do n't be so negative , Newlin . I 'm banking on the fact that the town council does n't yet know who owns Crazy Otis Landing . We only found out ourselves a couple of weeks ago . I told everyone on the pier to keep quiet . " " I do n't think anyone 's blabbed . " " I hope not . " Charity pushed open the door of the back room and wound her way through stacks of boxes to her desk . She sat down and reached for the phone . Quickly she punched in the number for Far Seas , Inc. , which had been included in the letter Hayden Stone 's attorney had sent to the shopkeepers . There were some odd noises on the line , a click , and then the phone finally rang on the other end . Charity wondered if the call had been forwarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly familiar voice answered . " Charms &; Virtues , " Elias said .
