July 18 , $ 26.50 and $ 31 ( 312 ) 335-1650 <p> John Mahoney and Gary Cole are together again . And again . <p> Onstage the Steppenwolf ensemble members are starring with Rondi Reed in Ariel Dorfman 's political drama " Death and the Maiden . " The roles were played on Broadway by Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss . <p> And on screen , they 're co-starring in the new Clint Eastwood flick " In the Line of Fire . " Eastwood , playing as a maverick Secret Service agent , takes on yet another Steppenwolf stalwart , John Malkovich , as a would-be presidential assassin . <p> In Dorfman 's play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raping and incarcerating a suspected dissident ( Reed ) , when she was a government prisoner 15 years earlier . Cole plays her husband , a lawyer appointed to a government committee to investigate just that kind of political torture . <p> Although reportedly inspired by real life events surrounding political unrest in the playwright 's homeland , Chile , in the ' 70s , Dorfman 's play is set in an unspecified small South American country . " He 's always very specific about saying that it could be anywhere , " Mahoney says . " He wants to universalize it . " <p> For the 53-year-old British-born Mahoney , a 1986 Tony Award winner for " The House of Blue Leaves " who makes his home in Oak Park , " Death " offers him some stage time between film assignments and the upcoming NBC series " Frasier , " a " Cheers " spinoff , in which he plays the father of Kelsey Grammer 's Dr. Frasier Crane . <p> " Of all the places I work , this is where I prefer to work most , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do theater , I 'd rather do it in Chicago than in New York . It 's as simple as just the fact that I live here really and feel more comfortable here . I 've never done a play in New York that was done any better than the things I 've done at Steppenwolf . <p> " I feel like I helped build this theater . When we moved into our new space at the Hull House , we put up walls , we built box offices , we scraped floors , we sold subscriptions . I 'm invested totally in this theater emotionally and artistically . And so , it just means a lot to me to come back and do a play here . " <p> Mahoney and Cole acted together in " Philadelphia , Here I Come , " Steppenwolf 's final venture in its old Highland Park digs . " We go back a long way , " says Mahoney , a 13-year veteran of the company . <p> Mahoney says the ambiguity in " Death " attracted him to his current Steppenwolf project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it does . And I like that , " he says . " It does n't preach , but it raises questions about an individual 's rights . " <p> The multifaceted nature of his role also attracted him to the play . " At times , he 's very charming . At times , he 's very menacing . At times , he 's very weak and he ends up very strong , " Mahoney says . " That sort of is what appealed to me as opposed to being all good or all bad or all charming or all one way or another . It just goes in so many different directions and I like that because it 's very lifelike . " <p> About his part in " Death , " Cole says , " I thought that it would be something kind of different for me . . . a little bit of a stretch for me . <p> " I 've played a lot of characters who seem to initiate more action than this character does . This character is really a reactor . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played , " says Cole , a Steppenwolf ensemble member since 1985 . <p> Cole , 36 , a Park Ridge native who makes his home in Los Angeles , is best known for his lead role in the " Midnight Caller " TV series and such TV-movies and miniseries as " Fatal Vision " and , more recently , " The Switch " and " When Love Kills . " He appeared briefly in two big-screen efforts , " To Live and Die in L.A. " and " Lucas , " before " Fire . " <p> In " Fire , " Cole plays a Secret Service agent who heads field operations of the presidential protection detail . " ( He 's ) somebody with zero sense of humor and who is very by-the-book ( and ) procedure-oriented , which ( the character played by ) Clint Eastwood is not , " Cole says . <p> Cole says he had a good time making " Fire " with Eastwood . " He takes the work seriously but he does n't take himself seriously . It was a very pleasant place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the set . It was just about the work , which was good , " he says . <p> " This is somebody that 's really a legend , somebody that I grew up watching . There 's awe that you 're face to face and working with somebody like this who you 've liked and grown up on . " <p> And he was glad to be joining fellow Steppenwolfer Mahoney on the film . " Any anxiety or nerves you have , if you know somebody you 're working with , that immediately helps that or reduces it , " Cole says . <p> Mahoney has appeared in some 20 films since the mid- ' 80s including " Tin Men , " " Moonstruck " and " Say Anything . " He plays Eastwood 's oldest friend and boss in " Fire . " " It is one of the most enjoyable films I 've ever made , " he says . <p> Mahoney labels Eastwood " just about the nicest guy I have ever worked with " and " just a real gentleman . " He calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great , wonderful , wry sense of humor . " <p> Comparing his work in theater to movies , Mahoney says , " You know , it 's funny , people usually ask you when you do stage and film , which you prefer . And , you 're supposed to say , I think , ' Oh , the stage and I only do the film for the money . ' I hear a lot of people say that and it always sounds kind of hoary to me . <p> " I 'm not going to bite the hand that feeds me . Films feed me a hell of a lot more and better than stage does . <p> " Both have their advantages and their disadvantages . You can be a lot more subtle on film than you can be onstage because you 're doing it right for ( the ) camera . You do n't have to worry about somebody in the back row of a 500-seat theater knowing what 's going on in your mind , " Mahoney says . <p> " But , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking that rollercoaster ride with the audience , that exchange of energy , it 's great . " <p> Working in the theater , Cole says , " Each night you come back and you get another shot at it . . . . When you shoot something on film , no matter how long it takes you . . . you shoot it and it 's over with and you go on . It 's done . You ca n't change it . Only the editor can change it . . . . But here we get eight chances a week at the same material . " <p> Fred Nuccio is a Chicago free-lance writer .
