In her new book No Go the Bogeyman , British scholar Marina Warner set out to study male characters in fairy tales ... and wound up on the theme of ogres " since princes were on the whole too insipid . " Richard Bowes sat down to watch the film Basquiat and was inspired to write this lovely story , which investigates the roles of men in fairy tales in an entirely different manner . Mr. Bowes is a librarian and a sometime antiques dealer who lives in New York . His most recent book , Minions of the Moon , assembles into novel form the Kevin Grierson stories we 've been so lucky to publish over the past years . <p> 1 . GOOD EVENING ! HERE I AM back working the door at an exclusive event . Like old times . It 's been a while since we met . I 'm not sure anyone else can see you in your coat of moonlight . Or what any of them would understand if they did . The secret behind my being able to recognize you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job , how I got married and had kids . If I 'd been able to read , God knows where I 'd be now . My not being able to write things down is why my memory got good . It 's why , even though I have n't done doors for a few years , I can still remember every face and name on the Lower Manhattan Art circuit . Tonight they 're celebrating the memory of the late Seventies . And back then no Downtown event was complete without me . So when they organized the party for the release of Victor Sparger 's Raphael ! I was asked to provide security for old time 's sake . The idea of this event bothered me and I was n't going to do it . Then something I read to my kids recently made me change my mind . That and something my wife told me . My wife , when we were wondering if you 'd be here , told me to say hello . Raphael ! is one painter directing a film about another . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . The movie 's set downtown twenty years ago when the art world was the buzz in New York 's ear . Big money changed hands . Large reputations got made . Victor Sparger was in right from the start . Painter and sculptor , very smart and pretty talented , he knew all the right names : Picasso and Braque , Warhol and Geldhazer . He was and is a prudent man . He invested his earnings , cultivated his image , bought real estate . Then out of nowhere came Louis Raphael . And in magazine articles about the scene Victor Sparger suddenly looked like a footnote . In this film , Sparger gives the world a movie about Louis Raphael . He intends that people interested in Raphael will find out about him through Sparger . It 's not exactly crooked or illegal . But it 's unjust in some way that 's beyond the reach of human law . That kind of thing only gets resolved in fairy tales . Which I take it is why you are here before me in that blue and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into Ling 's Fortune Cookie . You 're on everybody 's guest list whether they know it or not . The Fortune Cookie is new since the last time you were around . Back then the site was still an upscale gay baths . Now it 's a Chinese restaurant with waitresses who happen to be Asian guys . Drag is the gimmick of the moment . From inside the door we get to see the aging , slightly raddled survivors of the Mudd Club plus their younger tricks and camp followers . The walls are hung with shots from the movie . Some of the stills are of Raphael 's paintings . Out of backgrounds of dark carnival colors , Caribbean faces stare . Like they 're looking out of a deep , rich night into this bright room . Not angry . Not happy . Glaring not at but right through the viewer . And scrawled on the canvases are phrases in spanglish and Pidgin French , slogans that when you decipher them are like bizarre ads . " Breathe Oxygen Every Day , " that one over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Sparger has yet to make his dramatic entrance . It 's uncool to turn and stare at new arrivals . So everybody glances out of the corner of their eyes as the door opens . It 's obvious from their reactions that they see nothing but me surveying the room . I alone am aware of you . Everyone goes back to watching the murderers . Two of them are in the room . For an event this big , the jealous sculptor who threw his wife out the thirty-story window and the cokecrazed art dealer who tortured and butchered the fashion design student both showed up . They arrived separately and alone . Once each realized the other was here , they tried to stay as far away as possible . Like both are afraid of guilt by association . It 's the chance to witness this kind of encounter that brings out the crowds . Alert as forest animals , they watch a wife killer/sculptor powerful enough to throw almost anybody out a window , a sadist/gallery owner , sleek and taut , who could be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen . Not to people who have survived Max 's Kansas City , The Factory and Studio 54 . The craziest part is that I 'm here to keep out dangerous riffraff . In the mundane world , justice is a contest between bad luck and cold cash . The sculptor walked free , the dealer only served time for tax evasion . I almost feel sorry for the murderers . Compared to some of the guests , they seem pathetic . And theirs is n't the kind of wrong that concerns the Huntsman . Fairy Tale Justice is sure if not always swift and the punishment is appropriate . My only question is which tale gets told tonight . You smile at the question and there 's a glimmer like gold , like sunfire when you do . Seeing that , I remember how I found my place in the world . The place where I got brought up was in the Five Towns out on Long Island . Kind of a surprise , right ? But I was the tough , poor kid in the soft , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twice . And I was big to start with . Dyslexia , as I say , was the problem . My oldest girl has it too . Now they can actually do something . Back then when I reached ninth grade , they sent me to this old lady who sat in a little office in the cellar of the school . Just her and me . She 'd have me read and correct me . Stupid stuff . Not Dick and Jane but very simple sentences . It did n't seem to help and I hated her at first . Eventually I worked my way up to a book by the Grimm brothers . Those stories stuck with me . Maybe because I 'd never read anything else . Or maybe because the old lady was a witch . No disrespect intended , in case you belong to the same union or something . The characters I liked were n't the princes or princesses . In fairy tales , they 're a dime a dozen . You ca n't tell them apart . Poor tailors and honest woodcutters did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like to be poor if not honest . The out-of-work soldiers , sly , smart and smoky , making deals with the devil , caught me first . Like a prophecy , you know . Because rich kids get into as much trouble as ones in the ghetto . Drugs , stolen cars , breaking and entering : whatever they did they wanted me along as protection . But the rules are different for rich kids . When trouble came down , they all went into counseling . Thirty years ago , poor kids went in the army . Right then that meant " Nam . I did my tour in a bad time . When it was over , I became a discharged soldier , every bit as bent and nasty and bitter as the ones in the stories . It happened the devil was n't signing deals for souls at that moment or I would have gone that way . Instead , I bummed around for a couple of years , then started to contact old friends . A lot of them had finished college , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . So I followed them to this city with nothing but a dufflebag with my clothes and the only book I ever read . But everything was in that book . New York was full of frog cabbies who were actually actor princes under a cruel spell . Cinderella waited tables in every bar . Acquaintances had started their own little kingdoms : clubs and restaurants and galleries . Sometimes those places were n't in the best neighborhoods , or the patrons forgot their good manners , or the wrong kind of people wanted to come inside . They started calling me . Maybe a tiny bit wiser , I put the idea of the discharged soldier behind me . There 's another kind of guy in a lot of the stories . He never has the major role . But I did n't want stardom . He gets different titles : forester , game keeper , the hunter . He plays key parts . And I have the feeling he 's around even when he 's not talked about . Every king or queen needs a royal huntsman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods of Manhattan . 2 . WHAT 'S MY SECRET identity . It 's because of Rinaldo Baupre that I discovered it . And it 's because of him that I first saw you in action . Rinaldo is standing over there looking , as always , like he 's in pain . No , the years have not been kind to him . Drug treatment . Mental hospitals . It 's like something 's been tearing Mr. Baupre in two . Sometimes with celebrities , it 's amazing how much smaller they are in real life than in the media . With Rinaldo it 's the opposite . I 'm always surprised that he 's average height and build . On first meeting , he seems pretty creepy but in no way misshapen . Inside , though , he 's a dwarf , a troll . Mr. Baupre wrote the script for Raphael ! And he 's treated his own part in Louis 's life very sympathetically . It turns out he was the kid 's mentor and inspiration . Lots of amazing changes have gotten rung on history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , a sponger , a scene maker . And he had a legend . I mean , the name demanded one . So he was the illegitimate son of a French Resistance fighter who abandoned him and a minor Mexican muralist who died young . Rinaldo is a critic . Twenty years ago , the art magazines kind of used him to keep watch at the crossroads where art and the underground intersected . People were starting to pay attention to the downtown scene . Victor Sparger had started getting hot . Victor had gone through a careful rebellion , done graffiti , nailed broken glass onto boards . Rinaldo Baupre had a small part in his rise . But mostly Victor managed himself . By then I 'd met Louis Raphael through a young photographer , Norah Classon . Norah loved Louis like he was a little brother . He was this skinny Caribbean kid , living on the street , bumming money and cigarettes and a couch to crash on . I 'm supposed to say I got knocked out the first time I looked at his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could kick myself for not having the fifty bucks or whatever he was charging for a painting . In reality , the first time Norah talked me into letting Louis stay at my place I was pissed off because he got paint on my walls . And he was apologetic and cleaned it up . That was shortly before Rinaldo discovered Raphael . Like Columbus finding America is how my wife described it . That is , America was always there , big and rich and unexploited . A lot of Indians knew about America . But Columbus talked it up where it counted . Rinaldo was the same way . Others had the goods . But he had the contacts . And a talent for spinning . Most people ca n't do it . Publicity is the magic that spins gold . And once Mr. Baupre had done that for you , he never let you forget it . Rinaldo was always real nice with me . He was too smart to insult headwaiters or gate keepers . To our faces . And I was always polite enough . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classon . To give him credit , he saw what she had done and made sure that others noticed too . Of course , then he wanted her first born . For Norah in the days before she had children , that meant her work . And he claimed a major chunk . " Oh , this is beautiful ! Darling , I must have it ! " That kind of thing . He told people that he had n't just discovered Norah Classon , he had shaped her art . Norah and I were stepping out back then . She had gotten a one woman Soho show . He wrote the auction catalog and wanted his name bigger than hers . When she objected , he decided to sink the whole deal . One night in the packed bathroom at the Mudd Club , I was trying to fight my way through to the can . And I heard the unmistakable voice of Mr. Baupre saying , " I 'm the only hose in this hick town gas station . You want fuel , baby , you line up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discovered Louis Raphael . You do n't know who he is ! " Someone said something I could n't make out , a couple of other people got mentioned . Then I heard Norah 's name and Rinaldo said . " Not if she begged . Ms. Classon is over and done . She 's screwing doormen now . The next step is busboys . " And , yeah , I saw red . But I knew that decking Rinaldo would n't help Norah . These days I 've got a private investigator license . I 'm entitled to carry a gun if I ever want to . But a Swiss Army knife is about all I usually pack . Back then , I was still learning . I already knew enough , though , to stand aside and wait . As Rinaldo made his way out of room , he looked at something in his hand , grimaced and threw it aside . Curious , I recovered it and stepped out of the club . Under a light on Milk Street , I unfolded a matchbook for the Thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke or a camp , I was ready to toss it aside . And this figure appeared . A radiant being , I guess I 'd say . My first thought was that you were an acid flashback from the sixties . Then you spoke one word . What you said was , " RUMPLESTILTSKIN . " I did n't remember any hunter in that story . But I went home and reread it slowly , taking my time with every word like always . The girl whose future depends on her weaving straw into gold and the little man who appears and does it for her fit perfectly . She becomes queen but he 's going to take her child if she ca n't guess his name . I still did n't see where I fit in . Then I reached the part where the queen sends out a messenger to scour the countryside for the secret name . He 's the one who comes back just before the little man appears to claim the baby and says , " At the edge of the forest where the fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What he goes on to tell her is that he 's seen a bonfire and a little man dancing and heard the song with the name Rumplestiltskin in it . But that stuff about the fox and the rabbit gives him away . He 's a hunter . It makes sense . Who else would she have sent out to comb the woods ? So I made a couple of calls , took a little trip down to Pennsylvania . I found the trailer park outside Wilkes-Barre where a certain Mona Splevetsky lived . Oh , there was a dance and a song all right . Thursdays were polka night at the Thunder Ranch and I got her drunk and she boogied and told me all about her son Marvin . For people like Rinaldo their most important creation is themselves . With anyone else I would have called it the old and sorry tale of an unhappy kid who leaves his past behind . But I wasted little sympathy on Mr. Baupre . Unlike Rumplestiltskin , Rinaldo did n't put his foot through the floor when Norah Classon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it had so much power over him that he begged her to keep it secret and gave her back her career . 3 . A reminder of my next case is also here at Ling 's Fortune Cookie tonight . That scary looking lady waiting for Victor Spanger to appear is Edith Crann , the producer of Raphael ! The guy with her is an Italian industrialist . Her new husband . Edith 's face is amazing , tragic but unlined , pained but cold , crazy but contained . Bankrolling the film was a way of enhancing her investments . Edith Crann was the first important buyer of Louis 's work . She had no idea of why it was good . But Rinaldo advised her and took a commission . In the movie , Rinaldo and Victor have turned Edith into Louis Raphael 's muse . It seems that the tragedy of losing her daughter is supposed to have made her sensitive to the plight of a kid thrown out on the street by his family . Back at the time their daughter disappeared , I worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hired as a bodyguard-chauffeur for young Alycia . It did n't take me long to recognize Mrs. Crann . Everyone around knew she was an evil queen or a wicked stepmother . The only question was which story . Cinderella ? Hansel and Gretel ? I heard bartenders and waitresses , people who had worked for her , actually discuss this . Alycia was seven years old when we met . Her picture was in the papers all the time . She attended Broadway openings . She was at Met galas . Any little girl likes to dress up . All children are thrilled to be out late at night . Little twitches of adulthood . But mostly kids have childhood . Missing that is death as sure as having your lungs and liver cut out . One day I heard Mrs. Crann talk about her daughter to an interviewer . " We have long discussions about what she 's going to wear . I never push her . This is what she wants . " And the kid said nothing . Just looked at herself in the mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear . As a huntsman , I watched the animals . Like in the tales , they spoke the truth while people lied . Mr. Jimbo was the springer spaniel , brown and white , that followed the kid around . Alycia had named him when she was three . Whenever the mother put her hand on her daughter 's mass of careful curls , the dog tensed . I understood what he was saying : he had taken on a job that made him feel bad inside . Another time Mrs. Crann told someone , " I talk to Alycia in ways I never had anyone talk to me . It 's amazing . I come into her room the first thing in the morning and we discuss what she has scheduled for that day . " Queen Milly was the Persian cat . She got up from Alycia 's lap where she was sitting and slunk out of the room . I understood : even the cat could n't stand to listen to this . The parakeet actually spoke , of course . " Hi gorgeous ! DD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and asked , " Who 's the fairest in the land ? " " You are ! " said the parakeet . " Lady . You are ! " Then the bird flew into the next room and lighted on the little girl 's shoulder . " Hi gorgeous , " it said and whistled . " Fairest ... " , it started to say and fell silent as the mother appeared . Her face was like a mask . But the eyes behind it were wild with anger . Two things finally did it for me . First was seeing Alycia trying to skip like every seven-year-old does . Except she was wearing high heels and tripped . The second was the picture of her in a leather outfit . She was posed in what was supposed to be a worldly and sophisticated way . The idea , maybe , was to be cute . But her eyes under false lashes looked lost and desperate . In Fairy Tales , everyone 's a prince or a princess . Stepmothers move in to perform wicked deeds . In real life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty work . The parts of the story are just that , parts . They 're all shaken up and reassembled when you actually encounter them . What Edith Crann was doing was stealing her daughter 's most precious possession , her childhood . Seeing her parents , I knew that Edith herself probably had n't had one . They were a loveless pair of sticks . I almost felt sorry for Edith . Alycia did n't like those grandparents either . I know because we talked all the time in the car . She sat up front with me . Going to her mother 's parents , she 'd fall silent . They 'd look at her and would n't crack a smile . With her father 's side of the family it was different . Harris Crann 's family had gotten bigger and dumber with each generation . Harris was six foot tall and Ivy League . Waspy and stiff as a board . If he saw what was being done to his kid , he never let on . His parents were , maybe , five foot six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had established a charitable foundation . In the city , they had this huge co-op up on Riverside Drive , several floors , countless rooms . Kind of pretentious . But when they saw their granddaughter , their eyes lit up . Once I took her up there and they were n't home . Alycia smiled which she did n't do a lot and beckoned me down a hall like she was showing me this great secret . We went up some stairs and into this whole separate apartment within the larger one . That 's where I met her great-grandparents . Theodore and Heddy Kranneki were ancient and tiny . They had founded the family fortune long ago . They spent part of the year in the Homeland . They had done lots of work for the independence movement there . Probably they were little to start with but now they were no bigger than their granddaughter . They were entertaining some friends equally old and small . And smart still , with amazingly bright eyes behind bifocals . They looked at the kid in her leather outfit as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine and we all understood exactly what had to happen . So now we had the wicked stepmother and the magic little people in place . And the huntsman . That 's all the identity the story gives . He 's a royal employee , as I see it . One day he 's told to take the little girl out in the woods , kill her and bring back her liver and lungs as proof he 's done it . The boss 's wife has given him the orders . But he looks at the little girl and she 's so beautiful he ca n't . Thinking that the wild animals will kill her , the huntsman lets her go and brings back a young boar 's liver and lungs . These the queen has the cook boil in salted water then eats . I 'll be fair to Edith Crann , she was into more sophisticated dining . The day came when I was supposed to drive Alycia up to the Hotel Pierre . Edith 's parents were going to meet her and take her on vacation . Alycia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything her mother had done to her , she had the beauty that 's given to all kids , however the world may bend and warp it . When we were in the car together , we used to sing songs like I do with my own kids now . Old corny stuff . " Singing in the Rain " when it was raining . " A Little Help from My Friends , " when one of us was down . Or I 'd tell her stories . That particular day I told her Snow White . Not because she did n't know the story , but for the same reason I 'm telling you : to make it clear in my own mind what led up to this situation and what will happen afterward . Alycia understood . She was crying when I came to the part about the huntsman and the woods . We got up to the Pierre and there was a delivery truck broken down right in front of the hotel just as I 'd been told there would be . As instructed , I parked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb while I went around to get her bags out of the trunk . In their prime , Ted and Heddy Kranneki must really have been something . I turned away and on a gray morning there was a flash like sunlight reflecting on a passing rearview mirror . Magic . When I turned back , Alycia was gone . It was THE hot New York story for a couple of weeks . Cops grilled me . Reporters wanted my story . The question was whether I was an idiot or an accomplice . I had expected that . Alycia 's picture was in the papers and on TV . Posters were everywhere . The thing was , Edith Crann could n't help herself . The picture she used showed the kid in a slinky dress and a tortured expression . People began to wonder about little Alycia 's home life . That summer there was a nasty mayoral primary and a racial killing in Brooklyn , the Mets arose from the dead and ran for the pennant , someone named Louis Raphael came out of nowhere and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen in various places . But no new leads appeared . The Crann kidnapping story quietly died . That summer also Norah Classon and I both started going out with other people . Somehow , it did n't make me as happy as I thought it was going to . And it did n't give her more time for her career as she thought it would . I heard that she was having booze troubles . Probably the same stories were going around about me . A couple , friends of us both , invited me out to the Hamptons for the weekend because Norah was staying nearby . But when I dropped around to see her , she had left for Fire Island . When I took the ferry over there , she was gone . There is no tale where we see the huntsman get his rewards . Believe me , I 've looked and I know . But that Sunday evening I took the late train back to Penn Station . Walking underground along the platform of the Long Island Railway , I was n't paying much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humidity , I saw a figure of light . And when I looked your way , you pointed at the window of a car on the train I 'd just gotten off . Inside was a commotion , a bunch of conductors and nosy citizens standing over a sleeping woman . She looked vulnerable , beautiful , her hair long and loose . I got right onto the car , told them I knew her . They seemed doubtful . So I bent over Norah and kissed her . She woke up , put her arms around my neck and said . " Prince ! " And I picked her up and carried her off the train , up all the stairs and back home . Who 's to say that the huntsman did n't get to marry above his station and have three beautiful kids ? What tale says he did n't form a nice , discreet little security business , or that his wife has n't had a good career showing her work , teaching . When our oldest kid was little . I told her that story with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in the moonlight dress . When my daughter asked me who you were , I said to ask her mother . My wife also was raised on Fairy Tales . Maybe that 's what the marriage has going for it . But the book she had as a kid is different . French . There are n't a whole lot of Fairies in Grimm , in spite of the title . The French stories are choked with them . Fairy Godmothers especially . Even when they 're not mentioned , you figure they 're operating behind the scene . For a long while Norah would n't tell me much about her Fairy Godmother . Lately , though , she 's said a couple of things about you . She loved Louis , like I say , and this film has bothered the hell out of her . Which brings us to the matter at hand . People are stirring . Victor Sparger is about to make his entrance . 4 . LOUS RAPHAEL got a lot of money very fast . It 's too bad . He was basically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , like that life-size picture in the movie still on the wall . The staring face is almost familiar . the words are like slogans you heard in dreams . He came out of nowhere and caught the attention of the world . Everyone wanted to be his friend . Then something else caught their attention and he was left strung out , crazy and deep in the hole . Nobody wanted to know him . Then he was dead , way shy of thirty . Now everyone wants to be his friend again . That particular scene is now history . The boat has sailed , the balloons have gone up , the reputations have all been made . And anyone in the future who wants to set a movie in New York in 1980 will make it look like a Louis Raphael painting . Like they use Gershwin tunes when they want to say it 's 1930 . The downtown ethic is that if you 're not moving you 're meat . Enter Victor Sparger . Victor was the artist who had made all the right choices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , donated to the right charity , bought property at the right moment . In life he had been no friend to Raphael . As a rival , he was nowhere . But with Louis dead , Victor saw his chance to swallow him whole . He could make sure that anyone interested in Louis Raphael would have to go through Victor Sparger . That 's when his real talents came into play . He tied up all the rights to Louis 's life . He enlisted the help of Rinaldo Baupre and Edith Crann . He oversaw Rinaldo 's script . And in it he is Louis 's best friend , his big brother , his idol in bad times . The fact that back then Victor was busy jumping on the fingers of everybody who tried to crawl out of the hole disappears from history . Rumplestiltskin , after they guess his name , stamps so hard he puts his foot through the floor and rips himself in two trying to pull himself free . Watching Rinaldo Baupre tonight , I remember his mother telling me how Marvin Splevetsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous writer . Instead he 's a supporting player in the story of others " lives . And it 's tearing him apart . Owning Louis Raphael 's work has given Edith Crann a certain claim to existence . She is the sum of her possessions . She accumulates because she ca n't help herself . In that same way she once tried to collect the soul of a child . A short time after Alycia disappeared , Mrs. Crann started sporting a nasty little smile . It reminded me of poison apples and long comas . I worried about the kid . Tonight , though , Edith seems nervous . In the story , the queen 's spell is broken , Snow White wakes up and falls in love . The Wicked Queen is invited to her wedding and ca n't refuse to go . For the wedding , iron slippers get heated over a fire . When the queen sees them , she ca n't help herself . She puts them on and dances until her heart bursts . Did today 's mail bring Edith her invitation to Alycia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I said , my wife grew up with a different book . Sometimes the stories are different versions of the ones I know . I 've been reading them to my kids . As much of an education for me as for them . The other night , I sat down with the four-year-old and read him one I 'd never looked at before , the French Little Red Riding Hood . In the story I remember , she was Little Red Cap . I 'd already been asked to do this gig and certain things about it bothered me . But I could n't have told you what . As I read , though , I began to understand exactly what was wrong . Then I got to the end of the story and there was no huntsman who happens to be passing by . He 's the one who rushes in , cuts open the belly of the wolf and saves the kid and her grandmother . In my wife 's book , they get eaten and stay eaten . It 's one of the big hunter parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . All they have is some piece of smartass poetry telling us not to talk to strangers . That bothered me until I remembered that no Fairy Godmother appeared dropping clues in Rumplestiltskin . But you were there . You 're not in Little Red Riding Hood either . So I figure since you showed up today it may mean there 's a place for me in this version of the story . Now there 's a stir in the room . Victor Sparger , unshaven to just the fashionable degree , walks among us in a two-thousand-dollar workman 's jumpsuit . He 's smiling and sleek . The way you look , I guess , after you 've swallowed someone whole . And I do n't know how I 'm going to cut open this particular beast . See him one way and Louis Raphael was no innocent child . He 'd come off the street and that part of his life never left him . Another way of looking at it , though , is that nobody is more trusting than a street person who puts his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist who shows everybody in the world his riches . Almost asking to be eaten whole . As I think about that , your hand moves , a wand flashes like a laser . Something moves behind Victor and I realize the eyes in the Raphael painting have shifted . They stare , haunted , trapped , at Victor Sparger . The graffiti now says , " In Prison There Is Nothing to Breathe . " And the face is Louis Raphael 's . Everyone : Rinaldo and Edith , the murderers and the Chinese drag waitresses , the battle-hardened Downtown circuit riders who you can bet have seen a lot , turn toward Sparger and say things like , " Oh , Victor , what a big film you 've got ! " Sparger smiles , false modesty and vindictive triumph on his face . And he replies , " All the better to eat you with . " Or words to that effect . Then people see the staring face , read the words on the picture above Victor 's head . You nod to me that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that a Swiss Army Knife can kill in a dozen ways . I 've made it a point to learn none of them . But for this it 's perfect . I step forward and make a single cut across the front of the still . And , simple as magic , out leaps the one trapped inside . THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG . <p>
