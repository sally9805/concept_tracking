Richard Rorty 's Achieving Our Country : Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America is a tough but friendly criticism of the American Left , which today exists primarily in universities. ( n1 ) The criticism is written as a pragmatic or political defense of the United States , and so against both Marxian and " cultural " anti-Americanism . It is also written as a defense of our country as part of the Western project to reduce cruelty and achieve indefinite progress toward a fully classless society . Rorty cleverly revives the American perception , first described by Tocqueville , that pragmatism is the genuinely democratic way of thinking . MARXISM <p> The pragmatist Rorty agrees with Marx that the point of philosophy is to change the world , not to understand it ( 27 ) . But Marx and Marxists err by not going far enough in the pragmatic direction . Marx connected changing and understanding . By working toward history 's end and comprehending the results of historical struggle theoretically , Marx aimed both to end the misery of the oppressed and to make himself wise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as freeing the proletariat from its misery . <p> Rorty is able to lump together Marx , Leo Strauss , Adorno , Nietzsche , Heidegger , Foucault , Lenin , and Mao as antibourgeois and illiberal thinkers . The real enemy of these thinkers has been what Heidegger called the " wasteland " and Nietzsche the " last man , " the unselfconscious , enjoyment-oriented culmination of bourgeois culture . This thoughtlessly vulgar culture " is the contemporary counterpart of the culture that put Socrates to death , " the contemporary excess of democracy. ( n2 ) Antibourgeois or pro-Socratic ire is what Rorty says produced " Nietzsche 's occasional antidemocratic frothings , Heidegger 's attempt to climb on Hitler 's bandwagon , Sartre 's period of mindless allegiance to Stalin , and Foucault 's quasi-anarchism , " the versions of intellectual justification of cruel tyranny in our century . Liberals , such as Rorty , " think that cruelty is the worst thing we do . " ( n3 ) <p> Due to Marxism 's influence , Rorty observes , " the term bourgeois culture ' has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mainly the happy indifference of the " many " to their claims for wisdom. ( n4 ) Marxism has also kept intellectuals from facing up to their antidemocratic contempt . The Marxist-Leninist imagines that the revolutionary destruction of " the present , degenerate bourgeois many will be replaced by a new sort of many  --  the emancipated working class . " ( n5 ) This new class will somehow be both perfectly content and self-conscious or Socratic . So Marxist intellectuals claim not to have to choose between their own happiness and the happiness of the many . <p> But the experience of communist tyranny  --  Rorty actually echoes Reagan by calling the Soviet Union an " evil empire " ( 66 )  --  and the successful revolution against it in 1989 make it impossible for anyone to find Leninist hope credible anymore . So intellectuals now can not avoid asking whether " we are more interested in alleviating misery or in creating a world fit for Socrates , and thus for ourselves . " We now know that antibourgeois thought can not be , in effect , democratic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , the people who value self-consciousness , may be irrelevant to the fate of humanity . That Plato , Marx , and we ourselves may just be parasitical eccentrics. " ( n6 ) The pragmatist acknowledges that the pursuit of wisdom is an idiosyncratic , unachievable whim . The philosophers have no right to dominate others on its behalf , and they can no longer " hold on to the Platonic insistence that the principal duty of human beings is to know . " ( n7 ) If intellectuals are to be judged useful or unparasitic , they must contribute to the alleviation of cruelty and other forms of human misery . Rorty calls this new kind of philosophy " liberal irony , " which is the result of the philosopher applying Socrates ' method to Socrates ' activity. ( n8 ) THE PRAGMATIC VIEW OF TRUTH <p> Rorty repeatedly acknowledges that the alleviation of misery is , in truth , as arbitrary a goal as any other . So he shamelessly appeals to American chauvinism to defend it . Reflecting on Nietzsche , Heidegger , Strauss , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The former is " dominated by the German ' longing for some destiny higher than . . . last men . ' " ( n9 ) That longing comes not from nature or God but from idiosyncratic German culture or socialization . <p> The Anglo-American intellectual world is dominated merely " by the desire to avoid the infliction of unnecessary pain and humiliation . " ( n10 ) That reduction or simplification of desire is also a social or cultural product . Rorty quotes Nietzsche to show their agreement : " Man does not live for pleasure , only Englishmen do that . " ( n11 ) But Nietzsche should have added , " Man does not long for something higher than pleasure , only Germans do that . " And surely Americans do not long to be Germans . By showing that Nietzsche 's contempt for democracy is nothing but German chauvinism , Rorty hopes to have saved our intellectual world from antidemocratic infiltration . <p> So the Anglo-American Rorty , uninfected by German longings and the cruel illusions they generate , has no trouble subordinating truth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true whatever makes them happy . There is no " objective " or nonarbitrary standard of truth by which human beings can criticize what works in alleviating human misery . The view that God or nature provides no standard by which human beings might be judged turns out to be the most comfortable view of the truth . Without it , conscience or " sin " might impede enjoyment ( 32 ) . Belief in external standards produces unnecessary suffering . By choosing the most easygoing version of the most minimalist view of truth , Rorty shows how philosophy might be unparasitical . <p> If self-consciousness produces misery , the philosopher Rorty asserts , then it should go . He helps that process along by saying that there is no true self about which one might be conscious . So Rorty does not really mean to include himself among those intellectuals who value self-consciousness . We can wonder whether Rorty really regards his doctrine concerning the self as a true or a useful one . But the pragmatist denies the truth and utility of that distinction . <p> Rorty presents his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent or radically historical , and so all human experience is a linguistic or social creation . This antiessentialism is also " antiauthoritarianism . " Opposition to authoritarianism , Rorty reports , is what finally and correctly motivated Dewey 's opposition to all forms of Platonic or " otherworldly , " or soul- or external reality-based thought ( 29 ) . Dewey and Rorty refuse to privilege any view of the truth that does not improve the condition of beings with bodies . Rorty adds that Dewey and Nietzsche agree that we should " abandon the idea that one can say how things really are , as opposed to how they might best be described to meet some particular human need " ( 32 ) . So <p> Rorty does not really think his choice against cruelty or misery is arbitrary at all . Given Dewey 's and Nietzsche 's antifoundational agreement , the Anglo-American choice deserves to be the universal choice , and Rorty hopes it eventually will be . Rorty does not hesitate to add that the cruelty produced by selfishness and sadism , especially that produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is most inhumane , and so pragmatism is the true humanism . The pragmatist hopes , in love or charity , to free human beings from any residual longings they may have for the truth about God and nature . The pragmatist will help them forget about eternity , and so any form of immortality , for their own good . <p> The pragmatist does not teach the radical contingency of human existence to encourage existential courage in the face of the " abyss " ( 32 ) . But Rorty is not above striking a Socratic or Epicurean pose to shame intellectuals into becoming pragmatists . He says in one place that he hopes that human beings can overcome " the infantile need for security , the childish hope of escaping from time and chance " ( 17 ) . He also accuses intellectuals who cultivate religious longings at the expense of happiness of a " lack of intellectual courage " or " a failure of nerveO ( 34,37 ) . By not facing up to the truth about the finitude of all that is human , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 135-36 ) . <p> But Rorty 's more common and consistently pragmatic view is that a secure , risk-free existence is indispensable for overcoming cruelty . People have to be " relatively safe and secureO before it is possible for thinkers , poets , and so forth to manipulate their sentiments effectively in the direction of universal niceness. ( n12 ) The end of cruelty depends on universalizing material prosperity , but it requires more . People must actually experience themselves as secure . Living well with the prospect of one 's own death depends on not being strongly moved by it , on not experiencing the abyss as an abyss . Because " Dewey is as convinced as Foucault that the subject is a social construction , that discursive practices go all the way down to the bottom of our minds and hearts , " our minds and hearts can be deconstructed or reconstructed discursively any way we find useful . ( 31 ) . <p> Because there are no necessary limits to the human imagination , there are no limits to human experience . We can even talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Leninist dream of a misery-free , Socratic existence could not be talked into existence . Rorty 's thought that we must choose to be either cruel or unselfconscious contradicts the nerve of the pragmatic doctrine concerning our minds and hearts . Rorty 's criticism of Marxism implies some intractable limit to human manipulation . <p> Rorty 's own long-term goal , in any case , is to universalize " an agreeable cultural cosmopolitanism " ( 85 ) , the easygoing , sentimental , " nice " culture of sophisticated Anglo-Americans. ( n13 ) Rorty 's hope is that the nation and probably political life as such will wither away . But that apolitical future depends on political activity now . THE AMERICAN CULTURAL LEFT <p> Rorty criticizes today 's American Left for putting knowledge before hope , or truth before effectiveness , for claiming to know too much to have a pragmatic vision for American political reform . Our professorial leftists view America as a " farce , " as " Disneyland " and nothing more , from the perspective of a " detached cosmopolitan spectator , " from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-disgusted self-mockery . They have been taught by European thinkers such as Foucault and Heidegger that the American wasteland is the culmination of the technological devastation of human thought and imagination wrought by the Enlightenment ( 4 , 7,95-96,99 ) . <p> Cultural leftists pride themselves in being a " saving remnant " in an " inhumanly corrupt country , " one that is beyond help but not beyond understanding . They distinguish themselves from other Americans by the " insight " that allows them " to see through nationalistic rhetoric to the ghastly reality " that is America ( 7-8 ) . By writing as detached theorists rather than as engaged citizens , they leave their fellow citizens immobilized as political agents . Their dark , sardonic teaching becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy , a sort of negative pragmatism . The nation is left to nonhuman and humanly unworthy forces , and the caricature of America that the cultural leftists present might well become the real America ( 9 ) . <p> Rorty notices that the detached despair of the cultural left goes deeper . He asserts that " Foucault 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his " sagacity " but " of his unfortunate inability to believe in the possibility of human happiness " ( 139 ) . But Heidegger , Foucault , and their followers create the impression that human happiness is both impossible and unworthy of those who know . They dismiss all reformist pursuit of happiness as " discredited " or naive " humanism " ( 37 ) . Those with insight know that human desire is " inherently unsatisfiable " and that political life will always be distorted by power and oppression . They claim to write against sadistic cruelty , but there is something sadistic in their view of the inevitability of human cruelty . So the cultural Left denies the goodness and possibility of all that really matters to pragmatists or liberals such as Rorty . <p> Too much matters to cultural leftists . They have succumbed to German longings . Their theorizing aims to " satisfy the urges that theology used to satisfy " ( 38 ) . Their thought is marked by a revival of a form of religious otherworldliness in the longing for the ineffable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left is a form of authoritarianism , aiming to perpetuate cruel or useless longings that might be described out of existence . They give voice to those " urges which Dewey hoped Americans might cease to feel " ( 38 ) . Their longings are antibourgeois impediments to political reform in the service of human happiness . <p> The pragmatist deconstructs the theoretical pretensions of the cultural Left with stock Marxian/Nietzschean , which are also pragmatic and democratic , epistemological assertions . The detached or spectator perspective does not exist . All human thought is socially or linguistically or historically determined , and so all human thought or imagination must be judged by its practical effects . All human conflicts over truth and justice can only be resolved politically : " Disengagement from political practice produces theoretical hallucinations " ( 94 ) . Cultural leftism is not only practically pernicious but theoretically groundless . <p> For Rorty , the true distinction is between " cultural politics " and " real politics . " And hence cultural leftism , in truth , is at least almost an oxymoron . The founder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary Henry Adams , who parted from his statesmen-ancestors by mocking " real politics " rather than devoting himself to it ( 36 ) . <p> From Rorty 's perspective , Allan Bloom 's The Closing of the American Mind , with its preference for Socratic wisdom over justice , or knowledge over hope , is part of the fashionable , professorial , antibourgeois hopelessness of our time. ( n14 ) For Rorty , all " spectatorial and retrospective " thinking , all Platonizing and hopeless theory , belongs on the Right ( 15 ) . He does not state this conclusion so bluntly in Achieving Our Country , for rhetorical or pragmatic reasons . He hopes to reform the cultural Left with a political appeal and so build a new leftist political coalition . <p> Rorty portrays the American Right as ignorantly and incorrigibly selfish and sadistic from its beginning until today ( 45 ) . That obvious caricature is meant to inspire cultural leftists to enter the political fray to vanquish enemies . He uses fighting words to restore the political struggle of the virtuous , cooperative , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary Right . He observes that when American political competition is determined by that division , the Left wins ( 14 ) . Rorty 's outlandish demonization of the Right is also meant to mask the extent to which he shares contemporary conservative criticisms of the Left . He calls Pat Buchanan a " scurrilous " demagogue , for example , while agreeing with his pro-union economic nationalism and his criticism of the apolitical emptiness or indifference to social justice of contemporary cosmopolitanism ( 83-86,149n ) . NATIONAL PRIDE <p> A characteristic pretension of Socratic and cultural types is that patriotism or nationalism is nothing but " simpleminded militaristic chauvinism " ( 4 ) . It is a prejudice to be overcome through the cosmopolitanizing tendency of knowledge . But Rorty begins his book with " national pride , " making it clear how indispensable it is today for human improvement ( 3 ) . National pride is the political equivalent of self-respect . Too much pride breeds complacency , but too little produces a paralyzing self-disgust . Without a national pride that outweighs national shame , " imaginative and productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American political reform requires human beings proud enough to act as citizens and so emotionally involved enough with their nation not to find " vigorous participation in electoral politics pointless " ( 7 ) . <p> National pride is an imaginative creation . So all vigorous nations , Rorty observes , rely on " artists and intellectuals to create images of , and tell stories about , the nation 's past " ( 3-4 ) The pragmatic or only true purpose of those stories is always " competition for political leadership " ( 3-4 ) . In America , the long-standing competition between the politically active Right and Left is largely over the " nation 's self-identity , and between differing symbols of greatness " ( 3-4 ) . So national history and the symbol of America are best viewed as tools , generated by intellectual elites , to gain power and achieve reform . Those stories , in a democracy , must be convincing to and hence effective in moving the majority ( 101 ) . <p> So those who tell such historical , inspirational stories do not aim " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective truth about the past . Their descriptions are " attempts to form a moral identityO ( 13 ) . But such stories should not be called mythological or ideological as if there were a true story with which they should be compared . We know that the hypothetical objective story would be " of little relevance when one is deciding what sort of person or nation to beO ( 11 ) . We should say that objective history is impossible because it is not useful . We should not hesitate to add that the story that moves the nation in the desired direction is true . Perhaps a pragmatic criticism of Rorty is that he makes it too obvious that his story is not true . <p> Rorty can not completely obliterate the " objectiveO distinction between historical truth and falsity . He is limited by the standard of plausibility . He has to give credible versions of events that actually happened and persons who actually lived . He does not claim or want the Orwellian freedom to make history out of nothing , to make the past simply his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malleability of all things human to accept pragmatically the constraints of free political and democratic competition under the U.S. Constitution . His pragmatic view of the uses and disadvantages of history for the nation 's life is Nietzschean : Living well , in hope , toward the future depends on having neither too much nor too little knowledge about the past . Henry Adams and the cultural leftists both perversely insist on telling a story based on too much knowledge , and of the wrong kind . <p> Rorty presents a statesman 's view of the American intellectual 's responsibility to form the nation 's imagination . His elitism is political , not cultural . So he claims to be both a " thorough going " secularist ( 15,30 ) and an unreserved proponent of " civic religion . " The academic Left sees such religion as " narrow-minded and obsolete nationalismO ( 15 ) . But Rorty wants national devotion properly understood to become the whole of human devotion in America . Following his inspirational American heroes Dewey and Whitman , he wants reform toward " the utopian America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So " the struggle for social justiceO should become " the country 's animating principle , the nation 's soulO ( 17 ) . Human longing in our country should be for nothing more or less than " a classless and casteless America " ( 30 ) . <p> Rorty implies that a really thoroughgoing secularist would not speak of the nation 's soul . He does not mean to dispense with the religious " impulse to stand in awe of something greater than oneself " ( 17 ) . That impulse is not permanent or natural . It was a social or linguistic construction and might be destroyed in the same way . But a thoroughgoing secularist would be an apathetic , detached individual , without hope . He might be a person , like Socrates , who preferred knowledge or self-knowledge to doing what is possible to alleviate human misery . Without a hopeful awe for the nation 's future , Americans will not act as citizens . So a pragmatist can not work to end religious devotion now , because that would be the end of pragmatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his " easygoing atheism , " which is kinder , gentler , and more effective than the Marxist 's cruelly " aggressive atheism " ( 142 n ) . <p> With seemingly unprecedented candor , Rorty admits that civic religion is merely useful for achieving political goals . He does not say that human beings need to live in awe of something greater than themselves to live well . Nor does he say that political action is some sort of human need or perfection . Eventually , we should hope that nations and so civic religion will wither away . National pride is required today in the effort to create a cruelty-free and nationless world , and eventually we will need to take pride in the effort of our nation to evolve itself out of existence . <p> Rorty can be too easily accused of using the nation and the devoted individual to achieve a world in which both will be obsolete . That accusation , for Rorty , employs knowledge at the expense of hope . Yet in the absence of some external standard such as God or nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human freedom as such , civic devotion does not make sense from an individual 's perspective . That is one reason why Rorty observes that the eighteenth-century rhetoric of individual liberty was abandoned by twentieth-century leftists as no longer useful ( 50 ) . And he adds , of course , that there is no such a thing as a " self " with which an individual could have a perspective . <p> But such rhetorical denials do not seem particularly effective in answering the libertarian sort of democratic criticism that devotion to political reform requires the manipulative authoritarianism of an intellectual elite . They also do not do well with the Christian and Socratic criticism that civic religion is rooted in personal self-deception . Civic religion seems as antibourgeois or anti-individualistic as cultural elitism . Civic religion replaces " individual freedom " with " social justice as our country 's principal goal " ( 101 ) . <p> Still , Rorty 's version of civic religion , compared to others , is honest . He asserts that American devotion should be free from " obedience to any authority  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , " no standards . . . against which the decisions of a free people can be measured . " A free people does not submit , even in speech , to " anything which claims authority over America " ( 15 ) . <p> Rorty 's Whitmanesque American religion depends on the hope that there is " no need " for Americans even to be " curious about God " ( 17 ) . Their longings can be limited to American political choices alone . Anything can be described in and out of existence and be made to look either good or bad , even God . Because God was the justification for much cruelty and is no longer useful in the pursuit of social justice , and there is no evidence at all of his existence , the pragmatist is freer in dispensing with him than with historical truth . Americans , Whitman thought , are even free to " redefine God as our future selves , " making God self-creation ( 22 ) . <p> By denying that there is an external standard by which American political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most extreme American chauvinism . But Rorty does judge American choices from the perspectives of cruelty alleviation and the classless society . And he employs " the Hegelian idea of progressive evolution ' " as the most useful way of viewing the West and America ( 24 ) . HEGEL <p> Rorty 's standard is historical progress toward a world in which all American citizens and then all human beings are equally free from misery and humiliation . Despite his Anglo-American chauvinism , he admits that the most inspiring Americans , Whitman and Dewey , were in turn inspired by the German philosopher Hegel . Hegel is to be praised for focusing all human hope on the historical goal of a classless society . He is to be blamed for seeming to put theory over practice or for making historical progress appear inevitable ( 27 ) . <p> Rorty writes that Whitman thought it " obvious . . . that Hegel had written a prelude to the America saga " ( 3-4 ) , and in his Hegelian eyes , " the American Declaration of Independence had been an Easter dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of the ages would first be realized " ( 21-22 ) . The realization of this promise depends on the success of the difficult task of " forgetting about eternity " ( 19 ) . Hegel 's denial of the reality of eternity through his assertion that " time and finitude " or history are all that there is flows from his inspirational choice of pragmatic hope over knowledge ( 19 ) . And his antiauthoritarian denial of all reality but history helped the Americans choose the classless society as their history 's end . <p> The Hegelian idea of progressive evolution , Rorty explains , shows that the American story can not include multiculturalism . What is anti-American or anti-Hegelian about multiculturalism is its easygoing relativism , its " morality of live and let live , " its " politics of side-by-side development in which members of distinct cultures preserve their own culture against the incursions of other cultures " ( 24 ) . The Hegelian , unlike the relativist , has a standard with which to judge cultural and political development and oppose the preservation of anything unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political contest between " alternative forms of human life , " with the hoped-for result being a " synthesis " superior to either of the competing parts . Rorty 's example here is the American Civil War . He calls attention to the identification of the nation with egalitarian reform in the Gettysburg Address ( 9 ) ; the synthesis on his mind must be the moral nationalization of the Fourteenth Amendment . Rorty is usually for nonviolent and piecemeal reform of existing law , but the Hegelian must affirm the results of the " necessary " Civil War ( 24 ) . <p> Generally , Rorty 's American story praises the growth of the egalitarian reach of the national government , with its leftist , redistributive vision , its courts , and its expertise . Local government tends to be dominated by unsophisticated populations uninspired by the nation 's civic religion , so it tends to be racist , sexist , homophobic , nativist , and sadistic ( 52 ) . The pragmatist does not favor an active citizenry for its own sake , but only when it is imaginatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The constitutionalist political correction that Rorty makes of Dewey 's pragmatism concerns Dewey 's naive connection of virtue with participatory democracy . Rorty prudently recognizes that good government , whatever its form , requires technocratic expertise ( 103-4 ) . The Hegelian uses nationalist constitutionalism against reactionary , localist populism in the service of democracy properly understood . So he praises court decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education and Romer v. Evans ( 53 ) . They are useful in extending the reach of the national government in eradicating the cruel humiliation connected with popular racism and heterosexism . <p> Rorty writes that the Hegelian Whitman identified the progress of civilization with the end of the cruel repression of sexual eros and so with the growth of " the kind of casual , friendly copulation which is insouciant about the homosexual-heterosexual distinction " ( 25-26 ) . His vision began to become social and political reality in America with the " youth culture " of the 1960s . Prosperous young people became erotically and morally casual enough not to privilege one form of sexual activity over another and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But the struggle for social justice in the sixties was not only through casualness . In addition to the more famous civil rights movement , Stonewall , the revolutionary uprising of homosexuals against the police , deserves to be presented as a key event in American history ( 51 ) . <p> The American Right wrongly believes that civilization was devastated by the sixties because it connects civilization with the perpetuation of arbitrary standards of personal virtue ( 34 ) . But the Left regards that connection as a failure of the imagination , coming from the illusion that human experience is shaped or limited by " sin , " some ineradicable , cruel flaw ( 32 ) . For Rorty , all moral restraint is repressive cruelty unless it contributes to progress toward social justice . <p> Although a Deweyan pragmatist might be resistant to innovative forms of liberation from cruelty , he must admit that sex , drugs , and even rock ' n ' roll contribute to the production of a fully classless society . So Rorty agrees with Socratic cultural critic Allan Bloom that sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rutting animals are signs that today 's students have become nicer and more devoted to the American idea of justice and less moved by love and death . Bloom and Rorty both emphasize that a nice society is a classless one , and Rorty rejects Bloom 's Socratic objection to its unselfconscious contentment . Rorty goes as far as to say that universalizing the experience of the sophisticated students whom he and Bloom taught differently but described in much the same way is " all that is needed to achieve an Enlightenment utopia. " ( n15 ) <p> The Hegelians recognize no human limits to the reach of government in contributing to such reform , and so they praise as progress the indefinite growth of the welfare state ( 105 ) . And Rorty identifies the one achievement of contemporary cultural leftists as political correctness . Leftist professors , and the educational , governmental , and corporate bureaucracies formed by their influence , insisted that American language be purged of humiliating and degrading references to African Americans , women , gays , and so forth ( 76 ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students at leading universities , and then correctly formed college graduates imposed it on unsophisticated or cruel Americans . The result was a progressive reform of ordinary language . With a change in language , human experience changes too . This progress toward a fully classless society reduced the amount of inegalitarian humiliation in America ( 81-83 ) . It pushed back the influence of know-nothing American populism , " the religious fundamentalist , the smirking rapist , or the swaggering skinhead . " ( n16 ) <p> In Rorty 's Hegelian eyes , political correctness should also be viewed as a way of removing barriers to the common pursuit of social justice by all citizens . The " cultural , " including religious , experiences that separate one American from another can be talked out of existence . And the key American fact then becomes the imaginative recognition of citizens as citizens . Rorty sees that the function of civic religion in America has always been to oppose cultural diversity with pride in being an American citizen ( 100 ) . In an America freed by Hegel from nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of serious human differences . Rorty 's optimism concerning the linguistic or historical extinguishing of the experience of " otherness " separates him , of course , from the pessimism of the cultural Left 's multiculturalism , which he connects with the " otherworldly " Christian view that sinful human beings are always resident aliens in this world ( 95-96 ) . The pragmatist does not say that such success is certain . If the Left does not once again become nationalist and political , it may leave the American future to the demagogic Buchanans . But there is no necessary limit to the extent to which cruel otherness might be eradicated from human language and so from human imagination and experience . RORTY 'S RATIONALISM ? <p> I have only said enough about Rorty 's story of American achievement to show its Hegelian character . Nothing about it explains why a Hegelian , anti-multicultural vision of a classless society is not , finally , an extreme form of Western rationalism . Rorty agrees with Marx against the cultural leftists that human desire might be transformed to achieve complete historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about human existence . There will be nothing irrational  --  or cruelly , perversely contrary to human happiness  --  in the agreeably cosmopolitan life that the pragmatist hopes will eventually be possible for all human beings . But Rorty persists in asserting that the leftist America he is trying to construct " is neither more natural nor more rational than the cruel societies " of the past ( 30 ) . <p> That assertion , I think , is Rorty 's answer to Nietzsche 's " insinuation that the end of religion and metaphysics should be the end of our attempts not to be cruel . " ( n17 ) Morality defined as an egalitarian alleviation of cruelty , Nietzsche contended , was biblical , and its goodness depends on the biblical God 's existence . If that God is dead , that morality should be abandoned , because it is not self-evident or rational . <p> Nietzsche 's standard for that conclusion was " intellectual probity , " or a truthful confrontation with the human condition. ( n18 ) But Rorty rejects what amounts to Nietzsche 's rationalism . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality and achieve for themselves what God allegedly promised . <p> As long as human beings remain self-conscious  --  or moved by the intractable limitations of their finite , death-defined existences  --  the promise can not become true . Rorty talks away Nietzsche 's objection to linguistic self-deception by saying that Nietzsche confused the Christian , existentialist self " the one miserably agonized by its awareness of the abyss that surrounds contingent human existence  --  with the true self . But there is no true self , as Nietzsche himself said in opposition to Socrates , and so no reason not to create a less-miserable self . <p> In Rorty 's hoped-for and worked-for future , the world of human beings will be agreeable and reasonable or predictably tranquil , because they will be largely unselfconscious , or unmoved by the limits of their individual existences . Socratics and Nietzscheans affirm the perpetuation of cruel and unreasonable inegalitarian political oppression as the precondition for the existence of rational ( meaning self-conscious ) individuals . Both the " last man " and Socrates live reasonably in their own way . <p> Rorty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that pragmatic denial is not all that convincing . He lectures Marx and Marxists for imagining that a classless society could also be a Socratic one . He presents that impossibility as the only limit that reason or reality can place on the pragmatic imagination . The choice between Socratic or individual and historical or social rationalism has to be made , and neither is clearly more rational than the other . In that sense , Rorty can not call his hopeful choice rational . <p> It seems to me that Rorty remains too charmed by the fundamentally undemocratic Socratic or rationalist tradition by presenting his choice in that way . The Socratics and pragmatists seem to agree that most people can not live well in light of the truth about death . And so the ironic philosophers or intellectuals humanely give ordinary people linguistic therapy . Both Socratic and pragmatic thinkers and poets provide lies to talk away the truth in view of its cruelty , and they both use ordinary people to achieve their not wholly rational ends through civic religion. ( n19 ) <p> Rorty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to privilege the experience of Socrates . But in another way he is more elitist because his political or rhetorical struggle against the common perception of eternity , and so against the limits of human effort , is more extreme . The Socratics , by perpetuating the distinction between man and God , mean to keep some intimation of the truth in human imagination , but Rorty claims that distinction was a failure of the imagination that the Americans have overcome . So for Rorty there are no limits to what political reform might achieve , and there are no human limits to the reach of a government inspired by therapeutic intellectuals . <p> Although much of Rorty 's political criticism of the cultural Left is sensible , finally nothing is less rational than pragmatism . The fundamental , ineradicable human experience , as the American Thomist Flannery O'Connor said , really is consciousness of limitation . And it is beyond the capacity of thinkers and poets to make human beings unselfconscious . <p> The lesson Rorty should learn from the experience of the failure of Marxist communism is that Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invariably resist manipulation . From the Russian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , Rorty should consider the reasonable observation that if human beings were born only to be happy , they would not be born to die . It is both degrading and impossible for a human being to forget his or her relationship to eternity through total immersion in the thoughtless materialism of everyday life . Death can not be talked to death . More matters , in truth , than human happiness , and only by attending to the human responsibility of living morally in light of the truth can we be happy as human beings . It is only by renouncing the right to be happy that human beings can become happy . For that reason , it is misanthropic simply to identify God and morality with repressive cruelty. ( n20 ) <p> Still , we can be grateful to Rorty for reminding us that even a more humanly adequate version of the story of American greatness would have to include a place for liberalism 's humane aversion to cruelty , as well as justice defined as the eradication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
