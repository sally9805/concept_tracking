Not long after her 19-year-old son was murdered two years ago , Joyce McField of Broadview , Ill. , was contacted by a woman who said she was pregnant with his child . McField was inclined to believe her , and when the baby girl was born , she became a doting grandmother . Now and then , however , she wondered if the girl was really her granddaughter . So one day she took a sample of her dead son 's blood that the police had kept as evidence and hired a Houston company called Identigene to conduct a DNA paternity test . " I just wanted there to be no question marks , " says McField . The tests showed that the little girl was not her son 's ; McField has since severed relations with both the woman and the child . <P> McField is one of a rapidly growing number of people who , in the post-O.J. , post-Monica world , are taking advantage of the rapidly falling costs of DNA-testing technology to settle lingering paternity questions . And where there 's a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a company that comes along to fill it . In the DNA-testing industry , Identigene is it . <P> Though an estimated 200,000 DNA profiles are run each year by states trying to document child-support or welfare payments , folks with paternity issues rarely have the wherewithal to order up a test on their own . About five years ago , however , that started to change . It was then that Caroline Caskey , 32 , a French-literature major turned business student , thought to combine cutting-edge DNA analysis with old-fashioned , hawk-the-product marketing . A few years earlier , a lab headed by her father Thomas Caskey patented something called the " short tandem repeat , " a shortcut method of sampling DNA . Caskey saw the new technique for the cash cow it could be and founded Identigene , advertising her father 's technique as a simple and  --  at $475 a test  --  affordable way to establish paternity . Launching an ad blitz that included direct mail , TV talk shows and billboards in 30 U.S. cities , Caskey made sure she got her company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business has doubled in each of the past five years . This year the company expects to field 67,000 telephone inquiries and conduct 10,000 DNA tests , compared with 650 tests in 1995 . It now has offices in Japan , Korea , Brazil and the Czech Republic . <P> The business is not without controversy , however , most of it centered on tricky questions of privacy . Short tandem repeat technology is so sensitive that it can identify DNA from little more than the saliva residue on a soda can . " A moral principle in genetic testing is that it should always be done with the consent of the individual , " says Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania . " No one wants someone snooping into his DNA . " <P> But such niceties carry little weight for people desperate to establish something as consequential as paternity , and Caskey plans to keep cashing in on that need . Identigene is preparing to offer an even cheaper , $150 test that will profile newborns ' DNA to reassure anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . " It 's potentially a much bigger market than paternity testing , " says Caskey . And a bigger payoff too .
