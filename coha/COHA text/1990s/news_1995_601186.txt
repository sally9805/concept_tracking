<p> When President Clinton tried to redesign the nation 's health-care delivery system in 1994 , the American Association of Retired Persons decried the " powerful special interests " seeking to stop him . <p> This year , the AARP could look in a mirror . Republicans want sharp restraints on the growth of seniors ' health care , in order to balance the budget and save the financially strapped system . And the AARP is the most powerful special interest in their way . <p> Today , one of the AARP 's 31.5 million members , GOP Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming , opens hearings designed to cut the elderly empire down to size . <p> It wo n't be easy . In a city where special-interest groups ' money talks and membership walks the halls of Congress , the AARP is armed to the teeth : <p>  --  It 's got money - $ 469 million in revenue last year alone , including $ 165 million from the sales of insurance , mutual funds , prescription medications and other products . Yet most of AARP 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 1,752 employees , including 17 who lobby lawmakers for federal aid . Yet the group receives $ 86 million annually in tax dollars to administer federal grants . <p>  --  It 's got media - a bimonthly magazine and monthly paper that reach 21 million households , most in the nation . It 's even got its own ZIP code . <p> " It 's really a huge conglomerate , " says Tom Holt , who wrote a report on AARP for a conservative rival group . " Compared to the AARP , the National Rifle Association is a bunch of pikers . " <p> Second only in membership to the Roman Catholic Church , the AARP 's " halo effect " as protector of the nation 's elderly is in jeopardy , along with its postal subsidies , tax exemptions , federal grants , non-profit status and congressional clout . <p> Now Simpson is doing what Republicans , conservatives and AARP competitors have dreamed of for years , hoisting the group with its own petard . <p> " I 'm after the AARP , " says the 63-year-old senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the group . " I 've had a bellyful of them for years . " <p> Simpson 's motives are questioned by critics . While he grouses about the group 's business practices and federal perks , some suggest it is AARP 's defense of Democratic social programs and opposition to GOP spending proposals and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that have prompted his probe . <p> Many go further , accusing Simpson of a personal vendetta against the AARP born of his objections to the group 's defense of Medicare and Social Security , which Simpson would trim to tame the deficit . <p> Simpson 's " attack on the AARP smacks of the return of ( Richard ) Nixon 's enemies list , " says Patrick Burns of the labor-based National Council of Senior Citizens . Adds Dixie Horning of the Gray Panthers : " It seems like . . . ( Joseph ) McCarthy might be returning . " <p> But the investigation is sure to raise complex questions : <p>  --  Should the AARP get tax exemptions and postal subsidies when much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those battles have been fought with the Internal Revenue Service and Postal Service , and AARP has made concessions . The biggest , a $ 135 million payment in lieu of taxes last year to settle a nine-year-long dispute over the tax status of money AARP makes by endorsing privately marketed products , was settled when AARP simply wrote a check . <p> About $ 146 million of last year 's $ 469 million total came from membership dues of $ 8 per year or less . But even more came from the royalties - opponents call them " kickbacks " - AARP gets from insurance , investments , medications , credit cards and travel-related products sold by private companies , with its endorsement . <p> " They 're a money-making machine , " says James Martin , chairman of the 60-Plus Association , another of AARP 's smaller , right-wing rivals . " Nothing wrong with that , but go out and do that . Be a business . Do n't live off the taxpayer . " <p>  --  Should the AARP be allowed to run federal grant programs while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the organization received $ 86 million for a variety of grant programs , the largest of which employs low-income seniors in part-time , minimum-wage jobs . AARP says it spends every dime on the programs . At the same time , $ 35 million was spent on lobbying . <p> Says Marshall Wittmann of the conservative Heritage Foundation : " In essence , the taxpayer is subsidizing ( AARP ) to . . . advocate for more taxpayer dollars . " <p>  --  Should the products from which AARP reaps revenue be recommended to members over the competition , even though they 're not always better or cheaper ? <p> The July issue of Money magazine grades AARP 's financial products and services and finds them only slightly above average . Yet the most recent issue of the AARP Bulletin contains half-page ads for AARP 's auto , health , life and mobile home insurance plans , its investment program and its pharmacy service - and no ads for competing products . <p> " AARP is a media giant . AARP has more market penetration than any four publications in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxpayers Union Foundation . " They have the biggest propaganda machine in Washington . " <p> To all the accusations , AARP Executive Director Horace Deets , 57 , a former Catholic priest who now earns nearly $ 300,000 per year , appears unflappable . He defends the group 's non-profit status , its federal grants and subsidies , its lobbying techniques and membership service . <p> " The implications are there 's some wrongdoing , " Deets says , but notes Simpson has not questioned the legality of AARP practices . There 's no scandal , Deets says , so " why are we having this hearing ? " <p> Deets , in fact , declined to appear at today 's hearing , arguing that a previously scheduled board of directors retreat takes precedence . The group will respond to today 's accusations at a hearing next week . <p> In the meantime , AARP , founded in 1958 as an outgrowth of a group providing private health insurance to retired teachers , is getting both bigger and smaller : <p>  --  It 's gone online , offering members the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into annuities and life insurance and expanded its credit card offerings and is considering its own cable TV channel . <p>  --  At the same time , membership is dropping . Partly because of the group 's position on health-care reform and the rise of conservative rivals , it now has a paid membership of about 21 million households with 31.5 million individuals age 50 and older , down from a high of 33 million . <p> The group 's own surveys show only one in seven members joins for representation on issues , a fact opponents cite to argue AARP 's positions do n't reflect a majority of its members ' opinions . More than one in three join primarily for information , 22% for insurance and 21% for travel discounts and other benefits . <p> And they are not of one mind . About an equal number are Democrats and Republicans . And they have a wide range of views on fiscal and social issues affecting seniors . <p> Even within the same family , seniors are not of one mind about AARP . Utah 's Joyce Stumphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that I 'm against most of the time . " But she says her husband , Al , 56 , remains a member , to get " some good deals on traveling . " <p> AARP 's revenue and expenditures <p> The American Association of Retired Persons reported a $ 39 million in earnings last year . Some of the not-for-profit group 's finances : <p> 1994 revenue : $ 468.8 million ( in millions ) Membership dues $ 145.7 Advertising $ 47.3 Federal , other grants $ 86.4 Investment , programs , other $ 87.7 Group insurance $ 101.7 1994 expenditures : $ 429.8 million ( in millions ) Publications $ 100 Legislation $ 35.1 Federal , other grants $ 86.4 Member services $ 73.7 Programs , field services $ 71.4 Administrative costs $ 63.2 Member services Service ( provider ) Participants Revenue ( in millions ) Group health insurance ( Prudential ) 5.8 million people $ 102.0 Auto/home insurance ( ITT Hartford ) 1.6 million policyholders $ 25.0 Visa/Mastercard ( Bank One ) 1.2 million cardholders $ 8.7 Mutual funds ( Scudder Stevens &; Clark ) 800,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National ) 1.7 million members $ 4.5 Pharmacy ( Retired Persons Services ) 2.5 million people $ 4.3 Motoring plan ( Amoco ) 900,000 households $ 1.9 Mobile home insurance ( Foremost ) 113,000 policy holders $ 1.7 Travel services ( American Express ) 4,000 travelers $ 0.2 Total revenue $ 155.9
