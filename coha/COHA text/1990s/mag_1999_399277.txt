Section : Software Trends : TR 100 <p> You might think software is in for a relatively placid future compared with hardware or the Web . Sure , there will be higher version numbers and new featured but you might assume that there wo n't be any advances as revolutionary as the leap from the calculator to the spreadsheet or from the typewriter to word processing software . The TR100 say : Guess again . Big changes are coming in the next decade , they predict , affecting where software resides , whether we can tinker with its source code ourselves , how complex it is , and how we interact with it . These changes could make computing in 2010 more accessible and reliable than can easily be imagined today . Complexity Crisis <p> One reason the TR100 forecast sharp changes in software is that they think today 's consumer software is mostly pretty bad . Not only that  --  software , they say , is actually getting worse , as commercial designers add bell after bell and whistle after whistle with little concern for what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a serious decrease in the quality of software people are running , as complexity has increased , " says Paul Kocher , head of Cryptography Research . Computer vision researcher Michael Acheson Isard of the United Kingdom agrees : " As computers get faster , the applications people use from day to day continue to run at the same speed , or slower , and incompatibility forces people to continually upgrade to newer versions , often against their will . " <p> Many of those interviewed stressed that greater simplicity and design elegance is central to cleaning up this software mess . Kocher cites Java as a good example of what 's needed more widely . " Make the system as simple as possible , use small amounts of high quality code  --  the Java model tries to do this . " Eric Brewer , chief scientist of Inktomi , sees the move to simplicity manifested in specialized devices like the Rio M music player  --  which has its own very simple operating system . Although these computing devices do only one thing , they do it well  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet space ( see p. 102 ) . Open the Books ! <p> Perhaps the most radical method of increasing the simplicity and elegance of software design is to take it out of the hands of big corporations altogether  --  and give it back to the community of hackers . That 's the goal of the " open source " software movement , which the TR100 believe will be of great significance in the decade to come . Major open-source software is written by large collectives of hackers , collaborating over the Internet and fixing each other 's mistakes . The product is distributed free of charge , and those who use it are free to look at the source code . Open-source software offers two antidotes to the epidemic of complexity : The software 's components have been thoroughly tested before they 're used , and , if bugs crop up , they can be fixed in-house , because the source code is available . <p> These features will make open-source software resonate through the early part of the next century . Until now , however , the Linux operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , has been the province of serious programmers only . Packaging it in a more accessible form with new PCs may help to change that . The GNOME project , spearheaded by TR100 member Miguel de Icaza , aims to make a big difference and get free software onto everybody 's PC ( see " Programs to the People , " TR January/February 1999 ) . GNOME offers an intuitive interface ( written collectively , of course ) for high school students and everyday end-users . In speaking with TR , de Icaza displayed an intriguing combination of self-effacement and self-esteem . On the one hand , he acknowledged repeatedly that he was " very biased " in assessing GNOME . But lots of developers , investors and analysts agree with one of his " biased " predictions : " My project is going to kick ass ! " <p> David Gee , who started IBM 's alphaWorks online research lab , says the future may lie in a combination of open-source and proprietary approaches . Corporations may use an open-source operating system and Web server ( Linux and Apache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but , " for other software  --  corporate customers are looking for stability and someone to turn to for features and functionality . Databases , transaction-processing software , messaging , Web application serving , office productivity tools , and so on , require support and development and availability in numerous countries and languages " says Gee . " This is not a strength today of the open-source model " The Network Is the Software <p> Whether the software of tomorrow is open-source or made on the Microsoft model , it may well undergo another sea change , say the TR100 : departing the user 's desktop for the Web . Hotmail has already scored success by implementing this concept for e-mail . Eric Freeman , interface designer and CTO of Mirror Worlds , says other examples are out there . " Many of the online portals are providing e-mail , file storage , and PIM Personal Information Management capabilities all from the Web , " he said . " Essentially they are replicating the desktop . I think already there are a great many users who spend more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's de Icaza says he expects desktop software to remain important , but the Web approach allows more rapid updates to software , without the need for the user to do anything . ( His project 's GNOMEMail will soon offer a Web interface to e-mail . ) Speaking to Software <p> The disappearance of the " desktop " and the appearance of the " Webtop " might not be the biggest change we experience in software in the near future , according to the TR100 . Perhaps the most dramatic change will be that we wo n't type our commands  --  we 'll simply speak them . " Speech is the most natural and efficient form of human communication , " argues AI researcher Lawrence Saul of AT &T; Labs . " It remains a great scientific and technological challenge to understand how humans recognize speech and to mimic this ability in machines . Meeting this challenge will unleash a new era in man-machine communication . " Will the challenge be met soon ? " I certainly think speech recognition will arrive in this decade in a big way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naming speech recognition as the next decade 's single biggest breakthrough . And it will come none too soon , he claims , since " we are making major advances , but we still do n't have the relationship with the computer that allows us to talk and receive intelligent responses . " <p> Although the TR100 think talking to machines will be very important in the near future , they do n't necessarily think its largest impact will be on the PC  --  or that it will make the keyboard obsolete . The major use of the talking interface , they told us , will be in systems that are nothing like a desktop computer . Matthew Brand , an AI researcher at Mitsubishi Electronic Research Labs , looks to the Japanese cellular phone market , where interfaces for tiny devices are already cumbersome . " Perceptual interfaces , particularly those that interpret speech and visual gesture , will come to dominate as devices become too small to have keys and buttons , " he said . <p> But as in the other areas of technology , what gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TR100 expressed concern about new interfaces that track human speech and gesture . Isard says that in a few years machine-vision systems may well be able not only to detect people , but also to " give a good estimate of whether or not those people are acting ' suspiciously . ' " Isard expressed concern about potential abuses , citing a camera now being used in the United Kingdom to record the license plate numbers of all passing cars . Kocher of Cryptography Research mentioned similar cameras in the United States . Combined with computers and increasingly intelligent software , the cameras could automatically recognize license plate numbers and identify the car 's owner . " The FBI 's attitude is that if it 's not illegal , we should do it . If it is , we should get the law changed " says Kocher . And that 's an attitude that worries some of the TR100 a lot . <p>
