I caught the zombie weeping in the middle aisle , between breakfast cereals and cookies , staring at an empty patch of moonlit wall near the ceiling . The broom rested lightly in his hands , cradled in his dead fingers with its bristles still flared at the bottom , as though he had stopped his sweeping in mid-stroke . That lack of sound , the sudden hush , had drawn me down the stairs , as someone who lived by the sea would have been surprised one night if the waves had suddenly stopped their gentle shushing and broken in silence on the sand . <p> I had stopped my silent pacing in the hall above the store ; an art that I had mastered out of necessity and long practice , I spaced my footfalls carefully to thread the maze of loose boards that would wake Gwen , tell her instantly that I was out of bed again . If she found me here she would yell , plead , sulk in silence , coerce me to return to bed , to sleep . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still could not bear . <p> So at night I walked , measuring over and over the corridor that ran the length of the building , from one end of the apartment to the top of the stairs that led to the store below , until I collapsed from sheer exhaustion into utter darkness , too tired to dream . <p> Until the night the broom stopped . <p> " Albert ? " <p> I did n't realize at first that he was weeping , I 'd never heard of such a thing , and what could make a dead man weep ? My first thought as I came down the stairs , seeing him motionless and striped with light and shadow falling through the shuttered window , was that something was wrong , that perhaps he had simply shut down , as sometimes they did , falling over in their tracks at their employers ' feet , dropping their garden tools or the packages they were carrying , uncommon as such incidents were , it was the possibility of them that had kept from the zombies the right to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't until I stepped closer that I saw the trails , silver ribbons in the moonlight , that ran down his cheeks . <p> " Albert , are you all right ? " <p> His jaw hung slack , his shoulders slumped , and his gaze never wavered from that spot high on the wall . I followed it with my own eyes , straining to see what he was seeing , but whatever he watched was visible only to a zombie 's eyes . I touched him lightly on the shoulder ; I had never touched a zombie before , never had to handle Albert in the year that he 'd been working for me . The flesh of his arm was unnaturally soft and pliant , like dough , and I shuddered . <p> " Albert , " I said , a little more harshly . <p> After a long moment he lowered his gaze , turning toward me , and for a brief instant I thought I saw something there , a fire in the emptiness , a spark of " life . " But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling off down the aisle as the store filled again with the soft rasping of straw on linoleum . <p> In retrospect , it feels like it was that moment that the thought first entered my mind . It 's not possible , of course ; I did n't yet know what I later learned , had n't yet discovered what Albert saw , what was to be seen through the eyes of the dead . But perhaps some premonition , some shiver of a guess , had already set my mind in motion . <p> And I noticed , as Albert walked away from me , that he had not stopped weeping . <p> Life has a way of pushing you in directions you never intended to go , of carrying you in its currents to whatever eddy or tidepool it chooses to deposit you . We had certainly never intended to own a comer grocery , my wife Gwendolyn and I. That was too " normal " for us , so damnably normal that I used to wake at night with knives in my stomach , the small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted adventure , high times and glamor . Unfortunately we were both dogged by an equally strong streak of reasonableness , a prudence that belied our years . When I finished school , working my way through as a stocker and then assistant manager at Brock 's Groceries , we made plans to escape the city , settle someplace where adventure lurked around the comer ( though you could still come home to a soft bed and a warm house at the end of the day ) . Colorado , maybe . Or Idaho . <p> Depressions have a way of changing plans . <p> When the time came , we just could n't justify packing up for parts unknown without a job waiting , not in the state the country was in . The odds were against finding anything , and we had neither the savings to wait it out nor the passion to risk starvation . In the end , we settled . <p> I stayed on at Brock 's , and Gwen at Swanson 's department store , and we kept telling ourselves that one day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but right now we still owed on the car and could n't afford to make the payments and insurance without a steady income . As soon as that was paid off , we 'd head east , to the mountains . <p> Then came the furniture payments , and the credit card bills we 'd racked up . <p> We bought Brock 's the year I turned thirty . We 'd thought long and hard , but in the end could n't pass up the security ; old man Brock offered it to me at a special price , seeing as how I 'd been there thirteen years and basically running it the last five . The bank considered me stable and gave me the loan . <p> And that was that . Roots . Foundations . We were stuck . <p> Then we told ourselves that we 'd take great vacations , but we could never afford much help , and with both of us working full time and then some at the store it was impossible for us both to be off at the same time . Someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll hire some more help , promote Bobby to Assistant Manager , let him run the day-to-day , and then we 'll be free to go whenever we want . Someday . <p> So of course , when they began offering the zombies , we snatched one up right away . <p> " Albert ? " <p> The zombie turned toward Dr. Spaar , who checked a box on his clipboard and gave a nod that transformed into a shake of his head . <p> " I do n't know what to tell you , Mr. Richards . In every test that I can run here , Albert checks out just fine . Motor control , homeostatic functions , sensory response , everything seems fine . I do n't know what 's wrong . " <p> Albert faced front again , his eyes unblinking and locked on the wall , as if he were supremely interested in the six food groups as delineated by the FDA 's poster . In fact , he probably could n't even see the poster through his tears . Albert wept almost constantly now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second night I found him standing in the middle of the store , gazing up at nothing with overflowing eyes , I began to worry . After the first incident , I had made a perfunctory search for any information on weeping zombies , assuming it to be a rare but explicable phenomenon with highly technical causes , perhaps even something involuntary . I had been surprised to find absolutely nothing . Nothing in the local libraries , nothing in the free-access databases , no rumors among friends and acquaintances of anything of the sort that I had seen . <p> Perhaps , I thought , it was just an anomaly . <p> Two nights later I found him again in his state of . . . what , despair ? Can a zombie feel despair , or any emotion ? I had thought not , thought that had been a motivating factor behind the drive to hire them . They worked steadily , unemotionally , reliably ; almost like robots in those stories . Not that anyone would mistreat them for it . After all , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had families , their living kin . They had everything the living had , except for one thing : they had no mind . <p> A week after the first incident , Albert came in weeping and nothing would make him stop . He still worked ; he just wept while he did it . I thought it best to bring him for a checkup . <p> " The trouble is , " Dr. Spaar was saying , " we just do n't know enough about the brain still . Or about zombies . In many respects they 're like coma patients : certain involuntary systems continue to function even though there 's no EEG activity . But obviously they 're more than that . The zombie have consciousness , of a sort . They see , hear , touch , feel . But do they think Do they experience emotion ? Is this sadness , " he touched Albert 's dam cheek , " or is this watering eyes ? It would be helpful if they would speak t us , tell us what they 're experiencing . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak ? ' I assumed they could n't talk , " I said . <p> Dr. Spaar just shrugged . " They do n't , but not for any physical reason : not most of them anyway . Another one of the unanswered questions about zombies . " <p> He smiled at me and shrugged again , gave Albert a pat on the shoulder . He did n't know , did n't particularly care . Nobody particularly cared about the dead . Unless it was one of theirs . <p> Karen was born on the Fourth of July , so that later I would tell her the whole country celebrated her birthday . Gwen , exhausted after thirty-seven hours of labor , collapsed into a well-deserved sleep , and I sat with our daughter for a time , until the doctors told me to put her down and leave her be , to go home for the night and get some sleep myself . Instead I lit sparklers and fireworks and danced through the streets like a madman . <p> She was the type of child that everyone , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mostly took after Gwen . Physically , she was my wife in miniature , with the same small nose , the widely spaced green eyes , the hair just one brown tone shy of blonde . And her smile , the mischievous cocked-head grin . <p> Inside , she was Daddy 's little gift , and she clung to me and followed me around the store as soon as she could move , first at a crawl and later in that perpetual run , half a step ahead of a fall forward , of the two-year-old . For a time I carried her in a rucksack on my back as I worked around the store , fearful of mischance and mischief , humming songs to her and feeling her small , warm breath on my neck . Gwen told me I looked like a Bolivian housewife , and besides the child would never learn to walk if her feet never touched the ground . I gave in , and turned her loose . <p> For months I still thought I felt her breath on my neck , and would smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that time , had been around long enough to have entered the work force . Mitchell , Albert 's predecessor as general helper at the store , had been left as Bobby 's sole help in the days we were gone , the almost two days of labor , of Gwen screaming with the delights of natural childbirth and me hovering and pacing and chain smoking the celebratory cigars I had bought . By all accounts they managed things quite well , to our pleasant surprise . <p> Even more surprising , as we discovered when Gwen returned to work and brought our daughter with her , Mitchell was . good with children . He handled Karen like a flower , hovering protectively nearby whenever we let her play on the floor in front of the cash register , and though initially images of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein 's monster crowded my mind so that I vowed never to let the two of them near daisies or wells , Mitchell never raised a finger against her , never even bumped her accidentally . <p> I learned later he 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived . <p> Something is happening in their brains ; it 's not raw pulp , I 'm convinced of that . They tell us , for those who care , that they lack higher brain functions , that the brainstem and cerebellum still function for the most part , but the cerebrum and cortex are almost functionless . They have no memories , no real thought , just baseline comprehension and reaction ; but Mitchell remembered his daughters , and saw in mine a reflection of them . <p> I know that look in his eye , recognize it in hindsight . I see it in the morning when I look in the mirror , written in the dark circles of sleeplessness . Loss , longing and delicate shades of madness . <p> And now I know why Albert weeps . <p> I drove him out to the small tract house that was his family 's home . A cute little box of a place , identical to the rows upon rows of cute little boxes that surrounded it , all of which had sprung up in the forties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were old now and starting to collapse , the ones not kept up , but it said something to me that slapped-together houses of fifty years past looked better than " quality-built " homes erected ten years ago . <p> They did n't have a porch , just a concrete stoop that jutted out from the front door . Barbara Ann Davison sat on it , a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other , talking with her husband Bill and a neighbor . I could hear her laughter as I drove up . <p> The neighbor glared darkly at me , muttering something to Barb and scurrying off as I opened the door for Albert . <p> " Hi , Mr. Richards . " Barb nodded as we walked up . " Hello , Dad . " I noticed she had to take a swig of beer before the second greeting . <p> Albert did n't acknowledge her , simply stepped past her and into the house beyond . She flinched as his arm brushed her shoulder . <p> " What brings you but here to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in false conviviality . <p> " Well , I wanted to bring his paycheck by  --  " <p> " Could 've mailed it as usual , " Barb said . <p> "  --  and talk to you about something . " <p> " Dad ? " <p> I nodded . <p> For a long moment I was n't sure what she might do . She stared at the cracked cement , the cigarette dangling between her fingers and the smoke rising in chaotic swirls . After a long while she sighed . <p> " Bill , go in and make sure Dad 's okay , willya. ? " <p> Bill nodded and patted his wife on the shoulder , following the zombie inside . We all knew zombies did n't need looking after . <p> I waited until Bill was well gone . " You 've noticed it , too. ? " <p> " The crying ? Yeah , I 've noticed it . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> She shook her head , refusing to look at me , staring off down the street of houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two mirrors held facing each other . <p> " What do you think it is. ? " <p> " No idea , " she said . She gave a harsh , barking laugh . " Dad never was what you 'd call a real happy person . Even when he was alive . " <p> She lapsed again into silence . <p> " There 's something you 're not telling me , " I said . <p> " Just thinking how to say it , " she answered . " All these zombies and stuff , it 's real hard to talk about . Oh , I expect you do n't have much problem . He 's just a guy that comes and works for you , stays with you five days a week , good worker once you get used to the sight of ligaments and muscles and shit hanging out of him . But that happens pretty quickly , does n't it . He 's just an employee . You ever had one of yours come back ? Just when I get used to the idea that him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in Florida until May , just when I can say ' they 're dead ' without breaking up , he shows up . " She looked away again ; her eyes were dry , but a deep flush colored her cheeks , and her voice skipped along in breaths . " Like that . All gross , it still scares me to look at him . He does n't talk , does n't hold me close , just sits there staring . But what can I do ? He 's my dad . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " It 's pathetic and useless , and it 's all I can say . She was right ; I did n't know what it was like . Part of me wanted to ask her , " Is n't it better that he 's here at all ? He 's still your dad , and are n't you grateful for a second chance ? Not all of us got that , some of us would kill for that . " But I had no right . Instead I just asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " About two weeks ago . I woke up , middle of the night some time . Thought I heard a noise or something , so I get up and look down the hall . Dad usually sits in the chair in the living room at night , right where the hall empties out there , so I can see him when I look down the hall . Only he was n't there . And I hear this noise , like I left a window open and the wind 's coming through . So I follow it . <p> " Dad 's standing in the kitchen . Just standing there in the middle of the room , looking up by the ceiling . His arms are out , like he 's reaching for something , and in the moonlight I can see he 's crying . He 's crying and I did n't even know they could cry , and he never cried once while he was alive , not that I saw . And he 's making this sound , this whisper , I got up real close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , so I can hear . And he 's saying ' Maggie , Maggie , ' over and over , looking up at the wall . " <p> Barb 's voice had become a thin scratch of sound ; the effort to keep it steady made the veins in her neck rise in cords beneath the skin . I glanced up , and Bill stood behind her , inside the screen door . He looked as if he might cry himself ; he wanted to come out , to comfort his wife , but she was not the type of woman who accepted such things , so Bill held his ground . <p> " Maggie was my mother 's name , " she finished , and finally she turned toward me , a flame in her eyes , a fire of grief like I 'd seen in her father 's eyes nights before . " How come she did n't come back , too , Mr. Richards ? She was with him when they died . How come he came back alone ? " <p> I did n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel my own grief overwhelming me , and a damnable hope and despair . I drove off quickly , leaving her alone on the stoop , watched over by the indistinct form of her husband , half-hidden by the screen and the shadows indoors . <p> Karen grew fine and strong and all the things a parent wishes for a child . Gwen and I , for the first time , I think , accepted our lot in life , the place we 'd ended up . We might not have a life to sing about , but we had Karen , and she was more than compensation . Maybe , we told ourselves , when she 's grown , when she 's a young woman and leaving for her own life we 'll think again of adventures and faraway places . For now , we have paradise here . <p> Five short years , half a decade of paradise , is too cruel . It would have been better , I screamed at night , never to have given us a taste of it at all , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days rather than . . . <p> A car . Like so many others every day , but it 's always others . It 's never our own . A car trying to beat a red light , failing , not even close , accelerating to squeeze through before the flow of traffic changed direction , failing . <p> Gwen and Karen , pulling into the intersection . <p> They were both belted , strapped in and secure , as well protected as they could be . Gwen had become quite fanatic about that , had even lobbied for stronger seat belt laws after Karen was born . You protect your own . <p> Sometimes it 's not enough . <p> Gwen lived , to her great and utter despair . The car hit the passenger side . Karen 's side . The cheap metal crumpled like paper . It drove inward , slamming into Karen , into her side and her head , the window shattering and spraying across her face . <p> They said she never felt a thing . I do n't believe them . In my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that every instant is an endless moment of recognition and fear : the sight , out of the comer of our eye , of the oncoming car , our mouth , opening in a high scream , the door bulging , reaching for us , the glass bending in , gleaming like a bubble before it pops , bursting over us ; the long , clawing descent into darkness . <p> Five short years of Heaven before we were cast out . You learn sympathy for the devil . <p> The funeral was well attended , for Karen was a well-loved child , and a small sea of black-garbed children and adults covered the manicured lawn . Gwen stood beside me still as a stone , her face locked in an impassive gaze into the distance . Bruises marked her cheek and forehead , and when we were alone I 'd seen her wince when she walked as the broken ribs ground at her , but this was all the damage the crash had caused her , physically . And that was her punishment , she had told me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms , and I 'd been unable to stop my own endless torrent of grief and longing , and Gwen had watched in silence , dry-eyed . Shamed and raging , I had screamed at her , accused her of not loving our daughter , of not caring . I do n't know how she did n't hate me. in that moment . <p> " This is my punishment , " she 'd said , touching the green and black stains on her face . " This is God laughing at me . He took my baby , and all he left me was this . " In some odd way it would have been kinder to her if she 'd suffered more , been more severely injured , participated more fully in Karen 's death . Instead she 'd been shut out entirely , left to live with it and unable to justify her own pristine condition . <p> I had held her then , and asked her forgiveness , and cried through the night . <p> And now her eyes were still dry and her mind was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew , those I did n't , all wrinkled in grief and pity as they gazed on her pathetically small casket and the minister spoke in solemn tones about resurrection and rebirth . <p> My eyes fell on Mitchell . He stood somberly , as he always did , and somewhere he had found a dark suit . It was moth-eaten , holed through in several spots , many years out of date and exuding an aura of dusty dinginess . It so perfectly belonged on a zombie that I almost laughed out loud . <p> And bit my tongue as my brain leapt to associations . Zombies , resurrection . Dear God , it had never occurred to me before that moment . No one thinks of the dead , until it 's one of theirs . <p> No one understood , no one could predict who would come back . Would Karen return to us in a few weeks ' time ? Would we see her little body shuffling blankly around our home , an empty husk , a flameless candle ? Could we stand that ? Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no love in her eyes , forever ? <p> I do n't remember the rest of the service . <p> I never told Gwen of my thoughts , and if similar ideas occurred to her , she never told me . We went about our lives in fear and hope . <p> When it was obvious Karen was not coming back , I sat up all night and cried . I do n't know if they were tears of thanks or of despair , that I would truly never see my little girl again . <p> The zombie found me weeping in the moonlight , huddled behind the counter in the dark store . He never said a word , of course , never showed any emotion ; he just reached out a hand to me , reached down and helped me to my feet . <p> July 18th . The day was always like this , always found me , by its last minutes , crying someplace . But it was n't usually this bad , this overwhelming . She would have been twelve years old , I 'd thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a different route , or the other driver had , or I 'd held Gwen for five seconds longer at the door before they left , or Karen . Just as I 'd thought , in years past , she 'd be eleven today , ten today , if only , if only . <p> But this year there was Albert , who held his hand down to me and pulled me to my feet from behind the counter . When I looked at him , I could see he was weeping too . <p> What a pair we made ! A middle-aged man and a dead man , standing in the night and weeping for our loves . <p> " Is that why you cry , Albert ? " I said , brushing away my own tears and sniffing like a schoolboy , not really talking to him but simply giving voice to my morbid thoughts . " Because you 'll never see Maggie again ? Like I 'll never see my little Karen ? " <p> Albert turned away . <p> But there had been something there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , suddenly . Something between derision and pity . From a zombie . <p> " Albert ? " He had disappeared down the rows , and I glanced up and down them in the darkness , trying to find him , to know what that look meant . <p> I found him standing between the breakfast cereal and cookies , looking at a spot , hidden in darkness , high on the wall , weeping furiously . <p> " Albert , what are you seeing ? Tell me , please . " <p> His lips , I could see now as the moon slid through the window , were moving though no sound escaped from them . I leaned closer , straining with both eyes and ears , trying to decipher the movement of his mouth , and I recalled Barb 's story of the day before . It was easy to see after that . <p> " Maggie , " he whispered over and over . " Maggie , Maggie . " <p> " What do you see , Albert ? Dammit , tell me . " My voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And , impossibly , he answered me . A zombie , a being that supposedly could not speak , who felt no emotion and did only what he was told , answered me , told me what he saw , what I think they all see . And know I knew why the zombie wept , and why all of them , as we would now if we followed them at night or into their private places , wept . Albert just could n't control it as well as the others , could n't keep it inside , the pain and despair and longing that sprang from the curse of the zombie , trapped between two worlds and seared into silence . <p> " Heaven , " he said . " I see Heaven . " <p> I stand in the dark . Albert 's not with us anymore ; no zombies are , not after what I learned about them . Not when I know the pain they 're in . And yet . . . <p> So I 'm alone in the dark , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strips of light and darkness through the pulled blinds . I 've left a note for Gwen , so she wo n't be surprised when she comes down to the store ; she 'll be shocked , angry , disgusted , alone , but she 'll know what to expect , lying in the aisle between breakfast cereals and cookies . <p> Through the heart will be fastest , easiest , least messy . It needs to be quick , so that the brain shuts down automatically ; I 've read that much , at least , about zombies . People whose brains have been physically damaged never come back , and there 's some evidence that lingering deaths are less likely to return . A gun would be quickest of all , I guess , but I ca n't leave Gwen with that . <p> The best of both worlds . I 'll come back  --  somehow , someway  --  and so I 'll still have Gwen , still have the sight of her that I 've gloried in since the day we met . And when I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the threshold , into Heaven or whatever you choose to call it , into the place that Albert looked and saw his Maggie , I 'll see my Karen , my little girl . And I 'll whisper her name at night , and weep in solitude so that Gwen will never see the tears on my cold cheeks , will never know and never be tempted to follow me to the borderlands . <p> I raise the knife , and I 'm weeping already . <p> <p> By Carroll Brown <p> Carroll Brown is a third generation science fiction fan , with a master 's degree in Literature from Michigan State University .
