The poet Lord Byron -- vain , athletic , and often cruel -- was characteristically scornful of people whose bodies were swathed in too much fat . He called corpulence the " oily dropsy . " His biting description , was quoted by the great physician William Osler , one of the four founding professors of Maryland 's Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . Writing in his Principles and Practice of Medicine , the premier textbook of the 1890s and early 1900s , Osler declared that people were inclined to eat too much and too richly , exercise too little , and become too fat . He felt those habits made people less healthy , but -- surprisingly from our modern perspective -- he was not particularly worried that they might cause heart problems . <p> Osier reckoned there were approximately 6,000 American heart-attack deaths in 1917 . ( In 2008 , for comparison , there were 24,000 heart-related deaths in New York City alone . ) He did n't see diet and obesity as the biggest triggers for the problem . Heart disease , wrote Osier , was " met with most frequently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoke hard . " In fact he was anxious that it typically threatened doctors : " The life of stress and strain , particularly of worry , seems to predispose to it , and this is perhaps why it is so common in our profession . " He felt such stresses gave rise to high blood pressure , leading in turn to arteries furring up with the fatty plaques of atherosclerosis . <p> During the early decades of the twentieth century , the Western world saw a vast decline in the burden of infectious disease . As a result , doctors such as Osier increasingly turned their attention to the rising numbers of heart attacks and strokes . They could offer few treatments , making it vital to discover some means of prevention . Even so , the effects of stress and fat were not well studied until 1948 , when the National Heart Institute ( now called the National Heart . Lung , and Blood Institute ) began a project to monitor the health and lifestyles of more than 5,000 citizens of Framingham . Massachusetts . The aim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and others did not . <p> The researchers were particularly suspicious about the influence of a fat that could be measured in the bloodstream , a fat whose levels were not simply a reflection of overall weight . That fat was cholesterol , a sterol , or steroid alcohol -- a group of waxy , insoluble substances . Cholesterol already had a poor reputation , and was headed toward its present-day vilification . Yet it is a substance that is also essential to our lives . To lift a mouthful of cholesterol-rich food to one 's lips may seem tantamount to taking poison , but the health effects of such indulgence are far harder to assess . <p> In 1665 the English scientist Robert Boyle noticed mammals had a specific system for moving fats around the body . Experimenting primarily on dogs , he saw that lymphatic ducts became clouded after rich meals as fats were transported in from the gut . About a century later , cholesterol itself was first isolated from gallstones . Most of those stones are formed when the liver secretes excess cholesterol as component of bile but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First impressions do make a difference : in the early nineteenth century the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul coined the term cholesterol , which means " solid bile " in Greek . It was not a substance people seemed predisposed to like . <p> Physician William Osier conducts a clinic at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal , 1905 . <p> Cholesterol , however , turned out to be vital for life . During the first half of the twentieth century , chemists began to clarify cholesterol 's structure and essential nature . It became obvious that the molecule plays a key structural role in cell membranes . Moreover it forms the basis for much of our internal communication , both diffusing over short distances within single cells and traveling through the blood from one part of the body to another . Steroid hormones , including testosterone and estrogens , are made from cholesterol , as is vitamin D. It turns out that cholesterol is so basic to multicellular life that it is essential not only in mammals but in other animals -- even in plants and fungi , Our bodies get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it in our liver . That holds true for other species too . <p> It took until 1961 for the Framingham study to show that higher cholesterol levels were linked with increased rates of heart disease . Even then , the researchers were cautious . All it proved was the existence of a correlation : simply recording observations can not reveal whether correlations are causal . It might not have been high cholesterol , in other words , that caused heart disease . There was the possibility that some people possessed traits that caused both heart disease and the high cholesterol levels , or that heart disease caused an elevation in cholesterol levels . The difference mattered . Muddle up causality and correlation in human health and at best you end up telling people things that are wrong and useless , wasting their time , At worst you kill them . <p> In 1976 two groups of researchers isolated a drug that blocked normal cholesterol synthesis . They had found that it existed naturally in a Penicillium mold . For those interested in distinguishing among members of this useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and P. brevicompactum -- not from P. camemberti or P. roqueforti , which give us delicious cheeses , nor from P. notatum , the source of the antibiotic penicillin . And it is worth remembering that " antibiotic " did not start out meaning a drug that made us better . Rather , it meant a drug that was against life ( " anti-bios " in Greek )  - -  a substance manufactured by one species to wage chemical warfare against another . The drug that was isolated in 1976 was an antibiotic ( in the original sense ) belonging to a group now known as **42;1688;TOOLONG A reductase inhibitors . Their catchier and more commonly used name is statins . <p> Although Penicillium evolved statins because they blocked cholesterol synthesis in competing microorganisms , statins affect such a basic biological mechanism that they work in humans too . Not for the first time , scientists took a substance that was naturally poisonous and tried to find a way of adjusting it to become therapeutic . ( The notion that " natural " means " safe " whereas " artificial " means " dangerous " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of effectively and efficiently lowering levels of cholesterol in their patients . That meant that they could revisit their observation that cholesterol was linked to disease . It had become a hypothesis that could be tested . Correlation and causality could now be told apart . <p> Cholesterol crystals . <p> By that time , cholesterol was understood to consist of various components performing different jobs . The main two components are low-density lipoproteins ( LDL ) , so-called " bad " cholesterol , and high-density lipoproteins ( HDL ) , or " good " cholesterol . LDL was known to correlate with atherosclerosis and vascular disease , and statins lowered the blood levels of those molecules . The evidence for their consequent clinical effects began to appear in the 1990s . By 2005 , an overview of all the available data found fourteen trials that together included more than 90,000 patients . The results were clear : statins worked . They lowered LDL cholesterol and , as a result , lowered the risk of heart problems . <p> Today , much attention has turned to levels of HDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tire molecule 's physiological function appears to be to reduce atherosclerosis . Raising it should be a good thing . So far , however , every well-designed trial that has intervened in order to raise people 's HDL levels has been a disappointment . Current ways of raising HDL are ineffective at best , and , unexpectedly , they may even be harmful . There is a vital message here : the human body is so phenomenally complicated that the impact of an intervention can not be reliably determined on the basis of thoughtful argument and clever theory . Correlations and theories are marvelous ways of generating ideas . Their brilliance is no substitute for putting them to the test . <p> How frightened should we be of cholesterol-rich foods ? We are showered with different pieces of health advice . Some matter a great deal . Osler was right about smoking : it kills . No matter how old you are , stopping smoking is good for you . Eating more fiber , by contrast , although it is something we are often advised to do , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber and having a lower risk of gut cancer . Actual trials , however , show no such benefits . It is possible that they have been too small or too short to pick up small benefits , but it is very clear that eating fiber is not as good for you as smoking is bad . That matters . There 's only so much effort we 're willing to make in pursuit of health . If you love smoking and hate eating fiber , maybe you can face changing only one thing in your life at the moment . Between the two , your choice should he clear . <p> Eating less fat lowers your LDL cholesterol . To put it in perspective , though , it is helpful to consider the impact of lowering LDL by other means . Statins are the commonest , and like most medicines their benefits are moderate . If you 've already had a heart attack , then you 're at high risk of having another . For every five years you swallow your statin you gain a one in ten chance of avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance of the statin helping you is reduced . At the moment most doctors , myself included , do n't believe statins are worthwhile for people who are at really low risk of heart trouble . <p> It seems sensible to think that same way about foods designed to lower LDL -- spreads and drinks ( such as Benecol products ) fortified with plant sterols . Are they worth the trouble ? Assuming that lowering LDL via these molecules does the same as lowering it with a statin , you can estimate the benefits . At the age of forty-five , around 40,000 people need to eat sterols for a year in order to avoid just one of those 40,000 dying from a heart attack or a stroke . By eighty-five years of age we 're much more vulnerable anti therefore much more likely to benefit . Only around five octogenarians need to eat sterols annually to prevent one of their deaths . Your chance of benefit depends on your initial risk . <p> Applying that reasoning to dietary fat intake is difficult . Our information is shamefully incomplete . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live longer . The idea is so widely assumed to he true that there 's been little effort to test it -- always a worrying situation . The limited data we possess do point to a low-fat diet being a real cause of heart health , albeit without great confidence . Those studies suggest that people who manage to change their diet over the long term -- something most people find remarkably difficult to do -- may possibly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease by one-sixth . For comparison , those who manage to take their statin pills cut their risk by a third . Diet seems to matter , but other things can matter more . <p> Cholesterol <p> It is easier to think in black and white than in shades of gray . Doctors -- and I am as guilty of this as any other -- too easily offer dichotomies . We talk of healthy ways of living and unhealthy ones ; of good and bad diets . We do not do a good job of communicating the magnitude of harms and benefits , or how confident we are in them . We correctly say that cheese and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we fail to express the very different degrees to which these things are true . Smokers have a one in two chance of dying from their habit . Cheese eaters do not . <p> Perhaps because we doctors are so used to making decisions for our patients , we do n't often give them the information they need to make their own . But it is also because the moment you try to move away from presenting simplified pictures of what is healthy and unhealthy , you have to start using numbers to express yourself . Statistics , even simple ones , do not come easily to most of us . Nevertheless , there is no excuse for doctors not doing their best to use them in as helpful a manner as possible . At medical school we get trained how to do so . Politicians -- the other big group of professionals who like to advise us how to live -- have more of an excuse . They simply do n't get that statistical training . <p> Doubt can be as healthy as certainty . Not everything that seems good or bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks equally serious . Cholesterol is like the iron in our blood and the oxygen in our lungs : essential for life and deadly in excess . There is the risk that we do more harm from worrying about cholesterol than from eating it . Panicillium notatum did us a great favor by providing penicillin . I submit that P. camemberti is just as much to be gloried in . Understanding the impact of diet on health should make you thoughtful about what you eat , not destroy your pleasure in eating .
