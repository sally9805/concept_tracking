When a gun battle broke out three weeks ago over casino gambling on the vast Mohawk Indian reservation on the New York-Quebec border , journalist Doug George , 35 , became part of his own story . He picked up an AR-15 assault-style rifle and took part in an all-night shoot-out against pro-gambling forces . George , editor of two newspapers , the Akwesasne Notes and Indian Times , later wrote a gripping story about the battle , warning , " Unless we have permanent peace here , we 're going to resort to terrorist methods .

The victim : Harold " Junior " Edwards , who reportedly had taken no side in the inter-tribal feud .
