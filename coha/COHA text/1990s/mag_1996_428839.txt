Pulsar Planets and Bode 's Law Several years ago I looked into the relationship between the order of the planets from the Sun and their orbital radii in an attempt to upgrade Bode 's Law . On a semilog graph I plotted each planet 's sequence number , n , against r=kasup n , where r is orbital radius and k and a are calculated for the best straight-line fit . I found that Mars through Neptune fall along a reasonably straight line , as do Mercury through Earth so long as a blank space in the sequence is left between Mercury and Venus ( see the diagram below ) . While I was reading " The Planet of 51 Pegasi " in your January issue ( page 38 ) the illustration of the planetary systems of the Sun , 51 Pegasi , and pulsar 1257+12 attracted my attention . What caught my eye was the similarity in the spacing of the three inner planets of the Sun and those of the pulsar . I plotted the latter in the manner mentioned above . Again it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a tight straight-line fit . Surprisingly , the two straight lines are nearly parallel . If r for each of the pulsar 's planets is multiplied by 2 , the resulting values are 0.38 , 0.72 , and 0.94 a.u. , remarkably close to the 0.39 , 0.72 , and 1.0 a.u. for Mercury , Venus , and Earth . DICK McCUSKER 7505 Rocksham Dr. Towson , MD 21286 " True Color " Not So True The Hubble Space Telescope picture of the Eagle Nebula has gripped the imaginations of all who have seen it ( S &T; February issue , page 32 ) . Created by J. Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen , it became an instant classic and must already be one of the best known of all astronomical images . The caption says the rendering is a " close approximation of true color . " This can confuse many readers , who may wonder how bright blue stars can have red diffraction spikes and why hydrogen - normally colored red - is represented by green . // Bode 's Law Revisited // The caption for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imaged emission lines . Blue represents doubly ionized oxygen at 5007 angstroms ; green , hydrogenalpha at 6563 ; and red , singly ionized sulfur at 6725 . In the visible spectrum 5007 angstroms falls in the blue-green region , 6563 in the red , and 6725 in the deep red . This is a definite shift from the colors chosen to represent these wavelengths . It suggests , in one sense at least , that the M16 color image is not " true . " DON KURTZ Department of Astronomy University of Cape Town Private Bag , Rondebosch 7700 South Africa Hester Replies I agree that " true color " may not have been the best choice of words to describe the HST image of M16 . I believe the words I originally chose were " representative color . " Any attempt to produce a true-color image , short of exactly duplicating the response of the eye , is at best approximate and can occasionally be downright misleading . This problem is especially tricky for objects like M16 , where light is concentrated at specific wavelengths rather than spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensitive to the deep red of a nebula 's strong hydrogen-alpha emission line , while the human eye is not . At the same time , the bright blue-green lines of oxygen that dominate what the eye does see fall into a " hole " in the response of most color films . The net result is that color photographs of objects like M16 or the Orion Nebula almost invariably show them to be red , while through a large backyard telescope they appear noticeably green . As Don Kurtz mentioned , the color scale in the M16 image has been shifted along the spectrum from what the eye perceives , so that a blue-green emission line is blue , a red line is green , and a deep red line is red . Despite this , the published image is closer to what the eye would see than a color photograph would be . The blue-green cast of most of the nebula is not terribly different from the dominant color seen through a telescope , while the yellow and reddish parts would look somewhat redder . The net effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true color in the strictest sense , are representative , or at least suggestive , of the colors the human eye would see . Finally , the eye 's response to color can vary from person to person . True color is literally in the eye of the beholder . Nonetheless , I hope people continue to enjoy the show ! J. JEFF HESTER Arizona State University Dept. of Physics and Astronomy Tempe , AZ 85287 Haphazard Reporting Leads to Confusion At a planetarium show I recently gave to a group of children , I asked who had heard about the new planets circling other stars . About half the students raised their hands . A third grader chirped that one planet is nine times the size of Jupiter . I replied that the planet around 70 Virginis is at least nine times as heavy as Jupiter , but that does n't mean it 's nine times bigger . Another child volunteered that one of the planets has liquid water , though in fact discoverers Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler had said only that the planet was warm enough for liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard there 's oxygen on one of the planets . And that means there could be life . " I was truly taken aback - where had she gotten that notion ? Detailed spectroscopy does n't yet exist for these objects , so nothing can be said about oxygen being present in quantity . The children 's ideas might have been simple misunderstandings , but a glance at media coverage suggested otherwise . For the most part reports were accurate , but a few glaring errors are evident . The Toronto Star informed us that the planet circling 47 Ursae Majoris has an orbital radius " comparable to that of the Earth from its sun , " even though the announced value is twice that . The Toronto Globe and Mail reported that the " planet orbiting 70 Virginis is about nine times as large as Jupiter . " This was probably where one student had gotten his news . Yet Marcy and Butler 's unpublished paper and their press release cited at least 6.5 Jupiter masses . I was shocked to realize that " nine " had lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed , or less scrupulous , periodicals to be guilty of inaccurate reporting , but major newspapers should be above these kinds of errors . Educating people about science is n't the easiest thing in the world , and the task becomes more difficult if the popular media can not report new discoveries accurately .
