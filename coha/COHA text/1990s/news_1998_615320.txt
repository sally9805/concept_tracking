<p> The series by Journal-Constitution reporter Jane Hansen on the children of crack-addicted parents brought an outpouring of responses from readers . Here are some of them : Overkill on babies ' plight <p> It began as an eye-opening , hard-hitting report on the insidiousness of babies born addicted to crack . But after a weeklong barrage , the series " Growing up with crack " helped desensitize me and many other readers to their plight . Enough , already . <p> We are bombarded with stories of massacres , such as what is happening in Kosovo , to the point where we are no longer outraged . We are bombarded with stories on presidential sexual shenanigans to the point where we are no longer outraged . We are becoming less and less outraged by criminal activities of all sorts , for that matter . <p> Reporter Jane Hansen 's points about crack have been made . Allow us the opportunity to ponder them  --  and be moved by them . Then we can move toward solutions . TOM THOMAS Marietta Treatment should be funded The series " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem : the plight of the children . The heart of the solution is found in a public policy that makes substance- abuse treatment a priority . To that end , the Department of Human Resourcesboard recommended to the governor in our fiscal 2000 budget an additional $ 7.7 million for substance-abuse treatment for women . Now it is up to the opinion makers , such as the editorial boards of the Journal and Constitution , and the citizens of Georgia to compel our next governor and General Assembly to fund this request . LASA JOINER Joiner is chairwoman of the Department of Human Resources board . Cause for tears I cried . MITCHELL GOODWIN Denver Widen focus on the problem I will never understand why , in a city of many cultures , the worst is almost always shown as African-Americans . This problem with crack has no respect for person , ethnic background or financial status . The views and facts should reflect the problem as well as the public . CATHERINE WILLIAMS Hampton There are ways to prevent birth At the risk of sounding politically incorrect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't taken to ensure that these drug-addicted women do n't give birth to any more children , who must suffer for their mothers ' their sins . Would our local , state and federal governments prefer these atrocities to continue , rather than provide free birth control or sterilization to these women ? DONNA KRODMAN Marietta For kids to have a chance , everyone should have a role Directors of county social service programs should be fighting for more staff to meet the need . The community should get behind such efforts , which will gives kids a chance . Otherwise we are all guilty of the " Dumpster baby " mentality . <p> My heartfelt thanks to the medical staff and social workers at Grady Memorial Hospital , who face this problem with courage and perseverance . SUSY MARTORELL Atlanta Dealing in extremes was n't necessary <p> Unfortunately , in this series Jane Hansen had a tendency to villainize the women who are addicted and canonize the people who work with them . In reality , the people we serve have a treatable disease , and those of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do want to thank Hansen for calling attention to a disease and the people who deserve quality care . MARJORIE BUSH Bush is chairwoman of the Georgia Association for the Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse . Officials ' lax attitude is harmful The Sept. 28 segment opened describing " Jurassic Park , " an open-air 24/7 drug and prostitution carnival " just off Edgewood Avenue " at Boulevard . Successfully addressing housing code and drug violations would have had a tremendous positive impact on many of the kids in this neighborhood . Unfortunately , police politics and mismanagement of the code enforcement and compliance processes have thwarted the process . DAVE MacDONALD MacDonald is president of the Edgewood Heights Neighborhood Association . Mothers entitled to our help Most of these mothers were born and raised in homes of severe drug and alcohol abuse . They are addicted to crack and alcohol . This is a disease , not unlike diabetes or cancer . These women need help and counseling  --  not punishment . They are sick , and we can help them . With places such as the Mary Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are taken away from their drug-infested neighborhoods and given a chance to live the lives that God and humankind intended . SARAH MABAL Atlanta Permanent solutions The article " A forsaken generation " Oct. 4 brought to mind the fabricated Washington Post series about an inner-city youth addicted to heroin . Though Jane Hansen 's articles may be true and disturbing , they still serve the same white , affluent class ' need for the perfect victim : innocent children doomed solely by the actions of others . Undoubtedly , an outpouring of emotion and even money may now result in some relief for the crack children . <p> Nothing , however , will be done to help solve the larger issues of poverty and addiction , and the crack users , the mothers and fathers , will be further demonized and incarcerated by a discriminatory criminal justice system . Let us hope journalism may lead to more permanent solutions to our complex social problems . OLIVER SMITH Atlanta Fathers must share the blame <p> I am tired of reading articles in the paper making it look as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmothers . Where is the big article on the fathers of crack children ? Get off the backs of the poor mothers ; get on the backs of the no-good fathers . BADIA A. SHAHIL East Point A face that remains unseen <p> The graphic story of drug-addicted mothers and their babies , detailed so vividly by reporter Jane Hansen , left me wondering : When are we going to get the other side of the story ; namely , when will we see the faces of the fathers ? JOSEPH JOHN MILES Atlanta Joint effort proves helpful <p> Jane Hansen 's excellent portrayal of the children essentially orphaned by the crack cocaine epidemic points out how many agencies must work together to address their problems . Through the Grandparents Project , the Atlanta Legal Aid Society works with local law firms and Georgia State University 's Project Healthy Grandparent to provide free legal assistance in adoptions . The project 's attorney interviewed Mary Shannon ( featured in the " Moms Again " segment Oct. 1 ) and arranged for an attorney from Kilpatrick Stockton , a leading Atlanta law firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kilpatrick Stockton has adopted the Grandparents Project and sponsors training sessions for attorneys from many firms . Through this collaboration , the effect of the project is multiplied many times . <p> Attorneys who are interested in volunteering for adoption cases should call Monoka Venters at 404-614-3955 ; the next training session is scheduled for January . STEVEN GOTTLIEB Gottlieb is executive director of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society Inc . Ca n't be ignored As an organization concerned with improving the quality of life for women and infants , the Healthy Mothers , Healthy Babies Coalition has long advocated increased funding for substance abuse treatment for pregnant and post-partum women . This series has brought to light a problem that has been ignored for too long . It is an opportunity for the governor , General Assembly and the private sector to have a real impact on the lives of women and children in Georgia . KATHLEEN COHEN Cohen is chairman of the public affairs committee for Healthy Mothers , Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia . Cruel and unusual punishment <p> The mere fact that a mother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to take her child home is horrifying . It is sickening that children must suffer to protect their mothers ' " rights . " For many of these children , family reunification should be considered cruel and unusual punishment . <p> If there is a shortage of qualified foster or adoptive families , the state needs to open orphanages . These orphanages , with a loving and competent staff , would be safer and more nurturing than placement with drug-using , often negligent , parents . Churches , synagogues and other organizations could provide volunteers to supplement the staff . After permanently losing a child or two , many women might finally find the will to enroll in treatment and stick with a rehabilitation program . LYNN DEUTSCH Dunwoody Dilemma crosses racial lines Though I assume that the newspaper 's goal is to inform your readers of the problems and repercussions surrounding cocaine abuse , I find it appalling that all of the articles featured only pictures of African-American children and their families . Cocaine is not an African-American problem . It is a national problem that affects all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series " Growing up with crack " did not attempt to tell the complete story of crack cocaine in America , but rather was a depiction of how the crack epidemic has affected children in Atlanta and how one hospital , Grady Memorial , is responding .
