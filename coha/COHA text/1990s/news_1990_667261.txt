<p> William H. Donaldson 's first entrepreneurial ventures were in the paper-route and lemonade-stand businesses . But the broad-smiling man who becomes chairman of the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 2 did n't really make his mark until he was a teenager . <p> " I had a company I founded when I was in high school called United Enterprises , " says Donaldson , 60 . United employed 50 students who did everything from mowing lawns to teaching tennis . " We were one of the biggest private contractors in Buffalo , " he says . Make money ? " Oh sure , " he answers with a laugh . <p> NYSE officials were laughing for different reasons in 1959 , when Donaldson , then all of 28 , proposed founding a brokerage firm with two college buddies . Donaldson Lufkin &; Jenrette became the 10th-largest NYSE firm , catering to the growing institutional-investor community , which needed more sophisticated securities research than mainline brokerages were producing . <p> By 1970 , DLJ was the first U.S. brokerage to sell shares in itself to the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYSE rule prohibiting brokerages from going public , says Arthur Levitt , former chairman of the American Stock Exchange . The move opened the once-clubby brokerage community - and its profit statements - to unprecendented public scrutiny as others rushed to issue shares in DLJ 's wake . <p> Today , in some Wall Street circles , they 're laughing at Donaldson again . Detractors already are taking potshots , noting he 's been out of Wall Street 's mainstream for years . Since 1980 , he has been CEO of Donaldson Enterprises Inc. , a venture capital firm whose concerns are vastly different from those of a stock exchange or a major brokerage . From 1975 to 1980 , he was also out of Wall Street 's power loop , working as dean of the Yale Graduate School of Organization and Management , which he conceived and founded . <p> The diversity is a plus to his fans , who include James Jones , CEO of the rival American Stock Exchange . " He can bring a fresh outlook as an outsider who sometimes can see the forest a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Donaldson has rattled more than a few with his first hints of the NYSE 's new priorities . He already has made sarcastic remarks about some of Wall Street 's newer products , including the " derivative " securities used for program trading . And although his new employer gets three-quarters of its business from institutional investors , Donaldson is campaigning to win back the individual investor . <p> His daughter , Kimberly , 23 , says her dad was at first hesitant about the job because it meant " going back into the public eye " - something he found less than pleasant in a disastrous stint as No. 2 to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . But becoming NYSE chairman was appealing because " it would give him a chance to bring Wall Street back to the small investor , " she says . <p> Donaldson confirms that he likes the old-fashioned notion of Everyman buying a piece of the USA . " I believe that common stocks are a fundamental investment vehicle - a place where savings can be placed , " says Donaldson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference room chair . " The individual has clearly been frightened in our marketplace , feeling that it 's somehow a game just for the big boys . ... I 'm gon na do everything I can to re-establish the marketplace as a place where the individual feels more comfortable . " <p> That might be a good message to the general public , but Donaldson 's emphasis on the small investor will be fraught with controversy at the NYSE . Already , the exchange is losing business to regional and international exchanges ; and member firms and institutional investors are finding ways to bypass the NYSE . Donaldson 's risk in taking the part of the small investor is that some of the very things the small investor hates - program trading among them - are huge profit centers for the NYSE 's powerful members . <p> He also takes a risk being critical of those who do business off the exchange . Donaldson suggests that those who go to other markets sometimes do so with dark motives , such as avoiding stringent U.S. and NYSE disclosure rules . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes for the NYSE 's inability to keep its business . Another Donaldson view that could be seen as self-serving : that " dealer systems " such as the NASDAQ can take advantage of customers because they do n't allow buyers and sellers to come together in an open auction system . <p> Donaldson seems resigned to take the heat . " I 'm gon na try and say what I believe and take the slings and arrows that come from that . " <p> In his favor will be his understated style fitting for Wall Street 's post- 1980s hangover . " He 's not flamboyant , " says longtime friend Charles Symington of S.G. Warburg . <p> Jones , who met Donaldson earlier this year , says he was struck by the lack of " rhetoric and PR " from the new NYSE chief . With most people in the business , " you never seem to tear past the facade , " says Jones . But Donaldson said " How do you do " and then launched into a talk about family and the work ethic , Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's just the combination of entrepreneur and traditionalist the job calls for . " If you dialed Central Casting and told them what you needed for the NYSE , they 'd send Bill , " says Gordon Macklin , former chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers . If his detractors win the bet , it means Donaldson is the old- fashioned choice to oversee the decline of an outdated institution . <p> Bio Position : Incoming chairman , New York Stock Exchange .
