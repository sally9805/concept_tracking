There was a time when gas station attendants cleaned car windshields with soft blue paper towels . My dad inherited the company that made those blue paper towels , and shortly after the Arab oil embargo , due to poor financial planning , he went bankrupt . With no responsibilities in the towel business he turned to what really interested him , inventing disposable items , reasoning that if they could be thrown away , they would be bought . He invented dustpans to be tossed away with the dust , and paper bathing suits you could wear and tear . None of his inventions took off , and he had to get a job . The job did n't last , though , because he did n't seem to get along with the people at work . When the bank took the house and nothing was left in our savings account , he still was not defeated . He brought us out to the desert to live . <p> We pulled up in our Cadillac to the new place , a pink-and-white aluminum trailer set up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelle , " Dad said to my mother . " Do you see what I see ? " <p> " Yes , it 's a trailer . " <p> " No . " He pointed to a rusted white sedan sunk in the sand next to some cactus outside the trailer court path . " Do you have any idea what that is ? " <p> " No , Frank . I do n't . " <p> " Well , you have to hang on because I 'm not exactly one hundred percent positive . " <p> He jumped out of the Cadillac and within seconds was kneeling in the sand beside the sedan . <p> " It 's a Cortina , all right , " he called . " How do you figure that an English-built Ford would show up here ? " <p> She got out of the car without glancing in his direction . " Hot as an oven , " she said . <p> I said , " We 'll get used to it . " <p> " Come over and look . I bet you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hotter than hell , " she said , staring straight ahead . <p> I grabbed her hand . " Let 's look inside . " <p> After we walked a few steps she let go of my hand and returned to the car . She reached through the window for her purse and then laughed . " What 's the point , Marybeth ? I have nothing left to steal . " <p> Inside , an orange carpet patterned with red sunbursts covered the floor ; matching curtains hung from the window . " Not bad , " I said . <p> " Yes , Marybeth . " <p> We walked down a hall and opened the first door . " The shower 's all built in one piece . " <p> " So I see . " <p> Our voices echoed in the bathroom . She rapped her knuckles on the plastic-wood vanity ; when we passed the rippled mirror she stopped and examined herself , leaning into the mirror , almost touching her eyebrows to the glass , as if she wondered if it would reflect what lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the scent of Black Flag . She sat on the bare mattress , biting the inside of her lip , her eyes scanning the room . In our old house a room this size held her clothes . She got up and stood by the flowered curtain . <p> " I think it has potential , " I said . <p> " Why do n't you go help your father . " <p> " Let 's keep looking around . " <p> " You heard me . " <p> He was on his back under the Cortina . " Dad . " His face peered up at me from under the bumper . " Morn wants you to come inside , " I said . " Right now . " <p> I lifted my bike out of the U-Haul and followed the main road to town . Pretty pink adobe hotels gradually gave way to dilapidated houses surrounded by broken vehicles . The mountains lifted flush out of the powdery desert floor as if you could stick your hand right out and touch them . <p> When I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unloaded . Mother darted around giving Dad orders while he staggered under the weight of boxes . Her eyes were shining and her cheeks were flushed . " Here , Frank . Right here . " She pointed to a box bearing a label printed in her big , even hand . KITCHEN APPLIANCES : ELECTRICAL . He carefully lowered his box down on top of it . KITCHEN APPLIANCES : MECHANICAL . <p> Her hair was pulled back , and damp , soft feathers whisped around her face . " Perfect , " she said . " Just perfect . " <p> My bedroom was lined with wood-grained Con-Tact paper , and if I left my door ajar and lay with my head at the foot of the bed , a bar of light slanted through and I could read . I was deep into 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea when their voices rose . <p> " I was not born to cut supermarket coupons out of the newspaper , " Mother said . <p> " You 're terrific at it . " <p> " But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're the queen of coupon clippers . Everyone in Palm Springs is envious . " <p> " Do n't make fun of me , Frank . " <p> " I 'm sorry . Would you like to hit me ? Oh , please , " he said . <p> " Please hit me . " <p> " Stop it . " <p> " Come here . " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'd trade places with those scissors just to be in your hands . " <p> " Get away from me . " <p> " Adelle , Adelle . " His voice was as soft as buttercups . " You 've been wonderful . This has been awful and you 've been wonderful . <p> Now would you come here ? " <p> " You smell like onions . " <p> " So do you . Come here . Miss Queen . " <p> A chair scraped . I shut my door . <p> The court manager let Dad use an empty shed , and he went back to inventing . He took jobs intermittently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep us going . And although we were n't well off , Dad kept up a certain dignity ; he still had a few monogrammed shirts left and he insisted we buy Italian leather shoes as we 'd always done , even though people seeing us trudge through the sand in our fancy shoes must have thought we were odd . <p> He took so much pride in our well-made shoes that once a week he gathered them up and arranged them by the cactus outside our trailer . Then he hunkered down in his webbed lawn chair under the pink desert sunset , and with blue paper towels and a tin of English boot polish , he polished our shoes , setting them down on the Astro Turf . First my little shoes , then mother 's , then his . <p> In a discarded mailbox I found on the way to school , I kept a pair of Keds . Each morning before I bicycled to seventh grade , I stopped at the mailbox and changed out of my Italian pumps and into my sneakers . On polishing days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned that it was obvious I 'd barely worn them . <p> In the shed , Dad lifted a stack of newspapers and set it down on a coiled garden hose . " Have a seat , " he said to me . <p> I sat on the newspapers and looked at his cluttered worktable which he 'd made from a door . <p> " Just tell me how this strikes you . " He paused for drama , his expression shifting between pride and nonchalance . " Paper bed sheets . " <p> I did n't say anything . <p> " For overnight guests . You never have to wash them . Think of all the time you save . " <p> " Sounds great . " <p> " Great ? People love to buy things they can throw away . I bet this is as big as my cardboard cameras . I think we 've hit the jackpot . What do you think ? " <p> " I would n't mind if we had some money again . " <p> " What kind of attitude is that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists clenched . " This is bingo , Marybeth . Let 's celebrate . " <p> We drove to town , passing men in aloha shirts and women in vinyl high heels looking at store windows that showed wicker models wearing bikinis . <p> It was high season and the town was crowded . 31 Flavors overflowed with parents and kids , all of whom seemed to have the same color hair , plaid Bermudas and freckles . The people in front of us babbled about exorbitant condominium fees to the couple behind us as if we were an invisible sandwich filling . " You can have anything you want , " Dad said . " Order a triple , " he said , and I did . <p> We were halfway up the block with our ice cream cones when the counter gift caught up with us . " You forgot these . " She dangled Dad 's car keys in the air . <p> " Keep them , " Dad said . <p> She held the keys even higher . <p> " Who needs a car ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He touched her shoulder , bent his knees so he was her height , and pointed . " See that old blue Caddie up by the Rexall ? It 's yours . Bad on gas but it 'll get you around . " <p> She flushed and thrust the keys forward . <p> " Keep them . Really . I do n't want my car . " <p> " Please , sir ? " She gave a sickly smile . <p> " Sir ? " He turned to me . " Do I look like a sir ? " <p> " Look , " I explained to the girl , " we really do n't want our car . " Her mouth trembled . " Oh , all right . " I made an exasperated sigh and took the keys . " I 'll drive , " I said to Dad . <p> I woke in the middle of a dream where I was swimming in a thunderstorm in a turquoise-blue swimming pool . Something was dragging across the floor in the other room ; it was early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out my window . <p> Mother , wearing enormous dark glasses and an emerald-green silk scarf tied around her hair , was tossing things into the Caddie . Dad stood beside the car in his pajama bottoms , resting his hands on the top of the lowered window as if he were trying to sink the car into the sand . She dropped a stack of books . Dad did n't move a muscle to help her . She leaned over , and one by one the books sailed into the car , their jackets lifting out like bug wings . <p> I ran to the hallway when she came inside . <p> " What are you doing ? " I asked . <p> " Get your things . " <p> She brushed past me and flung open her closet door . <p> " What ? " I said . <p> " I do n't have time to argue . Get your things . " She shoved her clothes together and lifted them out of the closet in one bundle ; hangers clattered to the floor . <p> " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marybeth . " She moved past me again . " Or do n't . It 's up to you . " She shoved her back against the door and it slammed . I ran to the window . <p> Hangers lay in a pathway to the car . She was hunched over the steering wheel , fumbling with the keys . She got the ignition started and roared away without looking back . The dust settled , and my father , wearing his blue pajama bottoms and brown leather slippers , walked down the white line in the middle of the black road she 'd driven away on until he disappeared around a bend and I could n't see him anymore . <p> I walked in circles inside the trailer . Three times I opened her closet and it was always empty . I checked the little bathroom with the one-piece shower . The mirrored door on the medicine cabinet hung wide open , exposing enormous gaps between the bottles on the shelves . All of her things were gone . <p> I thought he would always stay up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could jump up to an alarm clock and sit in the breakfast nook and pay bills and organize his sock drawer and stop inventing . But he did . I hated my mother for making him live like this . Sometimes I 'd imagine planting a mine field around our trailer to keep her away from us if she ever returned . Other times I 'd devise ingenious ways of getting a job and hiring a private detective to return her . I knew exactly what would happen when he brought her back ; I 'd pay him off outside from a wad of hundred-dollar bills and lead her in by the hand myself . Dad would n't notice at first and then her fragrance would fill the room and he 'd spin around and his face would light up . <p> The Palm Springs supermarket was painted with pink icing swirls meant to resemble a mission built by the Franciscan fathers . Quaint wooden balconies clung to the stucco facade and overlooked the cars in the parking lot . I pushed the cart while Dad cruised every aisle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stranded in a snowstorm . He dropped a net sack of Coachella Valley grapefruit into the shopping cart next to three packages of chicken parts for freezing . <p> " We do n't even like grapefruit , " I said . " Who 's going to eat them ? " <p> " You are . They 're good for you . " We used to make fun of health food ; the vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists living in the valley were one of our best targets . <p> " Oh . Grapefruit tacos ? " I said . <p> He reached over and picked out two cabbages as if he had n't heard me . <p> When we got to the checkout line I began to unload the cart : a 12-pack of toilet paper , toothpaste tubes the size of logs , a quart of Tabasco sauce . Nobody uses a quart of Tabasco sauce , but I knew it did n't matter , he just did n't want the future to take him by surprise again . <p> " Can we stop at 31 Flavors ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled proudly and lifted up a carton of Neapolitan ice cream ; the picture on the carton was smeared and the colors looked like bad TV reception . " We can have ice cream at home . I 'm miles ahead of you , " he said . <p> After we unpacked the groceries , I took a fide . In the summer when the mercury rose to 115 in the day and plummeted down to 100 at night , it was too hot for the rich people to stay ; only the waiters and manicurists and maids all the people who lived in the Hacienda del Sol remained , having nowhere else to go . Most of the local shops taped butcher paper over their windows and closed . But the fancy national stores like Saks stayed open . <p> A blast of cold air hit me when I opened the door . The store was a glistening , pearlescent cavern filled with costumed mannequins and saleswomen . <p> Mother and I used to spend hours here away from the heat . We 'd start at Cosmetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wrists or to brush on makeup from the paint-box displays . By the time we got to Accessories we must have looked like twin prostitutes , but we took the escalator upstairs to Better Suits and Dresses and browsed as if we were queens . <p> The little bells that rang by the elevators , a muted ding ding , sounded in the distance . <p> " Can I help you find anything ? " A saleswoman looked at me from the perfume counter . <p> " I 'm waiting for my mother , " I said . <p> When the Fourth of July rolled around , Mother did n't call , which was not a significant event in itself , except that it was my thirteenth birthday . I stayed around the trailer , reading . About six , Dad knocked on my door and came in . He said , " I 've got a little something for you . " <p> We crunched down the gravel path to the shed . There was a bounce in his step I thought had vanished ; he was walking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Close your eyes , " he said when we got to the shed . <p> I shut my eyes and could feel waves of heat rising up from the gravel . " You can look now . " <p> I opened my eyes . There was my bike . Attached to the handlebars was a heavy metal box , and underneath , an object that appeared to be a hand grenade . <p> " That 's neat , Dad . " Did the box turn my Schwinn into a Harley ? Could I hop on , rev it up and jet through the dirt roads , passing cactus in a blur ? And what about the hand grenade ? " You do n't like it ? " he said . <p> " No . I love it , " I said . " What is it ? " <p> " It 's a portable air conditioner . " He pointed to the hand grenade . " Battery operated . It 'll keep you cool all summer . Try it . " <p> Watching expectantly , he leaned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so unbalanced . I got on , threw my weight against the pedals , and discovered that I needed all my strength to keep the handlebars even . But if I shifted to keep the handlebars from going out of control , I would lose my power on the pedals . The bike would stand there teetering , and then it would topple over . <p> I could n't fall down . He was watching me . <p> I could sense his inventor 's mind marking my sloppy course as I wove down the path . I struggled , trying to steer straight and keep upright at the same time . <p> I did n't fall down . <p> He was smiling with pleasure when I returned . My heart pounded . I concentrated on slowing my breathing so it would appear normal , and I held on tightly to the bike . I felt a strange kinship with it because it had n't toppled over on me . <p> " How 'd you like it ? " <p> I pointed to my face . " Cool as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I came home he was n't there . His things were still in the bathroom cabinet . I sat in the lawn chair outside , the Astro Turf looking naked without our shoes  --  big , medium , small  --  to cover it . The sky turned pink , then peach , then copper . Sprinklers spurted on , air conditioners hissed , bats skitted from tree to tree . I watched the palms turn black against the crimson sky until it was dark . I sat there for a long time and finally heard him crunch up the gravel path , whistling . I watched him go inside and turn on the lights and look for me . Then I went inside . <p> Things gradually smoothed out . Dad got a job at the Racquet Club as a salad chef , and on his days off he worked on shoes that told you how far you 'd walked . He planted a garden and made Mexican hot sauce in the blender . When I took the air conditioner off my bike , he did n't say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone call came . I had been watching an old Twilight Zone about a magic piano . <p> It was Mother . She was whispering . " If Frank 's in the room just say , ' Sorry , you 've got the wrong number , ' and I 'll call back later . " <p> " Mom ! Where are you ? " <p> " Is Frank listening ? " <p> " No , but why do n't you want him to know you 're calling ? " I turned The Twilight Zone off so I could hear her better . <p> Her voice returned to normal range . " Marybeth , I called to talk to you . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " You know I miss you , " she said . <p> " Sure . " <p> " How 's school ? " <p> " Out . " <p> " Out ? " she said . " Oh , of course , it 's summer . Have you made any new friends ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " <p> " Having a good time , then ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Things are good for me , too . I 'm in Los Angeles again and I found a nice apartment on a street that does n't have any palm trees . " She started to laugh and then changed her laugh into a cough . " Anyway , I took a job in a doctor 's office in Beverly Hills , and anyway , what I 'm calling about is we fell in love , the doctor and me , and we want to get married and start a new life . <p> " I did n't say anything . <p> She said , " All I need is for your father to sign the divorce papers . " <p> I sat down and turned The Twilight Zone on , but without the sound . <p> " Marybeth , are you there ? " <p> " I 'm here . " <p> " That 's disapproval in your voice , is n't it ? " <p> " No . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " <p> " You know how he is . " <p> " How ? " <p> " He could sell ice to the Eskimos with his charm . " <p> I did n't answer . <p> " Listen , " she said . " I do n't want him to talk to me just yet . I 'm not ready . " <p> " Why are you telling me this ? " <p> " I love you , Marybeth . " <p> " Is that why you phoned on my birthday ? " <p> " Oh , honey . I 'm sorry . " <p> " You 're calling because you want me to tell him . " <p> She did n't answer right away . I looked at the TV screen . Whoever sang at the piano had to sing the truth . " Listen , Marybeth , " she finally said . " If it 's too much for you , do n't bother . <p> He 'll get the papers in the mail , anyway . " <p> I hung up . <p> A month later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folded over three times . On the line at the bottom , marked with red-penciled crosses , I signed my father 's name . Then I bicycled over to the post office and dropped the divorce papers into the box with hourly pick-ups . <p> Dad had finally gotten it into his head that it was n't a sign of dishonor to wear tennis shoes instead of Italian loafers . We had just bought his first pair in town and were walking down Frank Sinatra Drive . <p> " How 'd you like to go out to dinner tonight ? " He kept looking down at his new shoes and increasing his pace as if his feet were trying to get away from him . " Would you slow down ? " " All right . " <p> I said that dinner would be fine . <p> He said , " Good . Because we 've been invited to someone 's house for dinner and I said yes for both of us . " <p> " Someone ' ? " <p> " Michelle . She 's the masseuse at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She 's great . She gives me tennis lessons and I give her Caesar salads . " <p> " Michelle the masseuse ? " I could just see her dangling earrings and short-shorts . <p> " You do n't have to take that tone of voice . She 's very nice . " " Good . " <p> " We could both take lessons and beat Spiro Agnew in the Bob Hope Open . " <p> " That 's golf . " A man in kelly-green pants and a lemon-yellow blazer was approaching us and I bumped into him on purpose . " I 'm not going anywhere for dinner , " I said . " I 'm staying home and that 's final . " <p> I crossed the street and left him . At the end of town I walked through the loopy golf course , watching Mexicans in power machines mow the greens , sending up sprays of grass that glittered in the light like chopped-up cocktail straws . After a while the path dropped out of the emerald golf course and I followed it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleached-white gully strewn with colorless beer cans and rifle shells . When I inhaled , the heat left a metallic taste in my mouth , as though my teeth were melting and all that was left were fillings . <p> Dad was in the armchair when I got back . I could n't see his face because it was almost dark . Something was wrong . <p> " I had a surprise when you were out , " he said friendly-awful . " Why do n't you turn on some lights ? " <p> All I could see was his silhouette . " I like it this way . " <p> He nodded and did n't say anything for a while . The kitchen clock ticked . " Are n't you curious ? " he asked . <p> " Sure , " I said . " But I 'm not going to Michelle 's . " <p> " Your mother called . " <p> He sat forward in his chair . " Do you know what she told me ? She told me I 'd forgotten something . That 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten to have a notary sign the divorce papers , she said . Now is n't that interesting ? " He paused and I could feel my face bum . " Oh , she was angry but she wants me to sign so she can marry this doctor guy . " He stopped again . " I suppose you know all about him . The two of you are as thick as thieves . " <p> " No we 're not . " <p> " He 's rented the room at the Bel Air for the reception already . Do n't look away from me when I 'm talking . It 's called the Garden Room . " <p> I forced myself to look into his face . <p> " Is there anything else in my life I should know about that you 've forgotten to tell me , Marybeth , or is that it ? That my wife wants to marry some doctor who bought honeymoon tickets to Florence three months ago . Anything else , Marybeth ? " <p> I did n't know if any words would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you pay the rent here ? You could sign my name to checks . Oh , I forgot ; I do n't have a checking account anymore . I 'm sure he does . No . He bought those tickets with a credit card . Maybe you 'd like to move in with him , too . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . <p> " It 's because of you she 's marrying that doctor . " <p> " That 's not true , " I said . But I wondered if he could be right . <p> The muscles around his eyes twitched and he stared at me . Then he slammed his back against the chair so hard that the chair jumped back . He was silent , his eyes inward . At last he spoke . " You do n't know a thing , Marybeth . Not a thing .
