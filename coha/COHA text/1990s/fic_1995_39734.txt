MICHAEL DUMAS STROLLED around the base camp at Cam Ranh Bay with his friends . Cooper and Blaine had taped plastic bags of marijuana to their cocks . They smiled knowingly at each other when they walked past the amnesty boxes where soldiers were encouraged to dispose of marijuana , heroin , amphetamines , and opium . <p> But Michael 's cock swung free and unencumbered in his fatigues . He did n't do dope or speed because he believed he needed to keep himself straight to survive the war . He drank scotch in base camp . Lieutenant Wiseman , his platoon leader , always bought Michael a bottle of the PX 's best scotch when he killed anyone above the rank of captain . <p> Michael was a sniper . He 'd volunteered for the job . When he was a boy , he 'd often thought about what it might be like to be a sniper . One of his ancestors had been a sharpshooter in B. R. Johnson 's division . Michael 's father had inherited Phidello Dumas 's Whitworth rifle . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a telescopic sight mounted on the side instead of on top like Michael 's rifle . It was possible to kill a man with it ae two thousand yards . When Phidello had been captured at the battle of Kennesaw Mountain , he 'd dismounted the rifle and hidden the parts in his blanket . Before he 'd left for Vietnam , Michael had taken the rifle out of the gun cabinet and felt its weight and imagined what the war might have been like for Phidello . Michael 's father had flown bombers over Germany . He 'd never talked much about the war . <p> Michael 's hunts were based on patience . He 'd locate an enemy base camp and lie in cover and wait , usually for days . Once he 'd lain in his favorite type of cover , a stand of bamboo , for nine days before he found a target . Instead of eating army rations , freeze-dried food that all tasted the same , he ate homemade fig preserves and peanut butter his grandmother sent him . She lived in Ruleville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his summers there . He recalled sitting on her porch and shooing bluejays out of the fig tree that grew at one end . Now , after he ran out of peanut butter and preserves , he ate snakes and insects and fruit favored by the monkeys . <p> He 'd discovered that working alone had an unexpected bonus . He 'd expected to feel more afraid going out by himself than with his platoon , but he did n't . He realized it was because he no longer had to watch his Friends be blown apart and imagine his next step would be on a mine . Now when he met the members of his platoon in base camp they gathered to the sounds of drunken shouts and laughter , not to the screams of wounded men . <p> Out on the mountains , if he stayed off the trails and moved carefully , the enemy would never know he was there . They searched for him after he killed , but he 'd found a way to escape them . He 'd climb a tree and stay there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than three days , not even to defecate . He 'd string a camouflaged nylon hammock high in the third story of the triple-canopy forest and sleep while the North Vietnamese searched in vain for him on the forest floor . He never left the fear completely behind . Out alone in the forest , especially when he was lying in wait to make a kill or drifting off to sleep in the hammock while birds sang and monkeys fed in the canopy around him , it took on the quality of something intangible : a smell he could only half remember or a sound he 'd heard only once but no matter how hard he listened never could hear again . <p> His latest kill was a North Vietnamese brigadier . He 'd waited a week for a shot at the man . Michael found waiting easy . That was his gift as a sniper , for he was only an excellent shot , not a superb one . He had a way of stepping out of time , so that even while he was awake and attentive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were part of some waking dream . And when the chance for a shot came he was always relaxed and ready . <p> He 'd lain in a clump of bamboo , on the soft leaves . His position overlooked a pool in a stream that wound through a narrow valley . On the other side of the stream was a North Vietnamese base camp . The brigadier , a brilliant strategist , had been giving Michael 's division plenty of trouble . <p> The general was a product of the French airborne school in the Pyrenees . Captain Williams from division intelligence had shown Michael a black-and-white picture of the brigadier as a young man , sitting in a cane chair at a Paris cafe . He stared stiffly at the camera , with both his arms resting on the table . He held a cigarette between the fingers of his left hand while in his right was a glass of wine . A closed book lay on the table . His face was blank , indifferent , as if he were taking no notice of the city street that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is an exceptional man , " Captain Williams said . " He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne . He knew Sartre and Camus . They sat in cafes together and talked . " <p> They were in Captain Williams 's office , which had an air conditioner set in the window . Michael 's file was open on his desk . <p> " A poet-warrior , " Michael said . <p> " I see you were a history major , " Captain Williams said . " You can appreciate him . " <p> " I 'm going to kill him . I do n't want to know too many personal things . " <p> Captain Williams had told Michael a little about himself . He was from Mobile . He had gone to Vanderbilt where he majored in philosophy . He 'd gotten his commission through ROTC . There was something in his manner of an older fraternity brother . <p> The captain produced a bottle of scotch . Michael wondered if his preference for scotch was somewhere in his file . <p> " Dumas , do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave fifteen thousand years ago in Spain ) " he said . " Men shooting arrows at each other . " <p> Michael nodded his head . He 'd seen the picture in a textbook . Little stylized stick figures of men . The artist had skillfully rendered them in violent motion . <p> " What happened before that is the question , " Captain Williams said . " I wish I knew the answer . " <p> " Folks were always killing other folks , " Michael said . <p> " Maybe . But there might have been a time when they did n't . Animals do n't kill other animals of the same species . At least not often . Not in any organized way . Lions do n't se out to hunt other lions . " <p> " Too dangerous . " <p> " That 's a good answer . " <p> Captain Williams filled Michael 's glass . <p> " Nietzsche believed we need enemies , " Captain Williams said . " That we 've given up on a life worth living if we renounce war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael said . <p> " The man you 're going to kill has , " Captain Williams said . <p> Michael was uncomfortable . He wished that someone would come into the office so Captain Williams would stop talking . <p> " And Nietzsche held that the spiritualization of sensuality is called love , " Captain Williams said . " Do you believe that ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Michael said . He felt cold . He wished that Captain Williams would turn-off the air conditioner and open the window . <p> " I 've read all the books that General Son read as a young man in France , " Captain Williams said . He stood up and began to pace back and forth across the room . " He surely read De Sade , " Captain Williams said . " De Sade said there is no better way to know death than to link it with some licentious image . God , what an insight ! " <p> " De Sade was sick , " Michael said . <p> Captain Williams returned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he said . " Love and death are twisted together . We live not recognizing that . A fatal bit of ignorance ; " <p> Michael had met this sort of soldier before . Captain Williams , who had never killed anyone , had an insatiable , almost voyeuristic curiosity about the nature of the act . <p> " Why did you volunteer to do this sort of thing " Captain Williams asked ; <p> " I 'm a good shot , " Michael said . <p> " Do n't you ever think about the sort of killing you do " Williams asked . " Do n't you have some sort of reaction ? Something you do n't understand ? " <p> " I do n't get a hard-on if that 's what you mean . " <p> Captain Williams laughed . " You come to Mobile next year , " he said . " After you 've read those books . Then we can have a real talk . " <p> Captain Williams told Michael he was going to graduate school at Harvard after he got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ole Miss . He wanted to teach history in high school . But he did n't tell Captain Williams this . <p> " You get this guy , " Captain Williams said . " I 'll debrief you . " <p> Captain Williams dismissed him . Michael stepped out of the building into the heat . It was a relief to feel he humid air heavy and wet in his lungs . <p> The first two days the waiting had been easy , as if the forest-covered mountains and the blue sky and the green water were all part of a dream . On the third day thoughts of women intruded with a sudden and disturbing violence . Michael would not have been more surprised if the forest had suddenly disappeared from the mountains , revealing the naked rocks and the enemy camp beside the stream . He was always careful not to think about women . But all during that third day , from the moment the sun had risen over the mountains , falling in bars through the bamboo stalks and falling on the water below and turning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  centerfolds , strippers , old girlfriends , a singer in a base camp rock band  --  had settled upon him with a palpable weight . <p> He 'd opened his fly and taken himself in his hand , something he 'd never done since he 'd arrived in Vietnam six months before . A moment later he 'd come onto the leaves . After that he found it necessary to masturbate once a day ; otherwise time passed with maddening slowness as images of breasts and nipples and curly patches of hair moved lazily through his head . The come dried quickly in the hot sun , leaving a sticky , ghostlike patch that attracted flies . He wondered what his debriefing with Captain Williams might : be like if he reported his behavior . <p> At noon soldiers brought a table and chairs and a white tablecloth to a spot overlooking the pool . They laid place settings and see out bottles of wine . Michael imagined the furnishings and wine being carried on trucks or bicycles or even on elephant back down the Ho Chi Minh Trail so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then the brigadier and his officers arrived and sat down for lunch . The brigadier called for a toast . Michael did n't think he very much resembled the thin young man in the Paris cafe . He had grown pudgy ; he was animated instead of stiff . He moved his hands as he talked and laughed with his officers . That was probably the way he talked with Sartre . As the general put the wineglass to his lips , Michael shot him in the head , and the tablecloth blossomed red with wine and blood . <p> He 'd spent five days lying in the hammock , high in the canopy , while the Vietnamese hunted for him . After they 'd given up he went over the mountain and used his radio to arrange a helicopter pickup . The chopper took him directly to division intelligence , where he expected to be debriefed by Captain Williams . He was angry at Williams for planting in his mind those thoughts about the nature of killing . And he wondered just how much of his experience he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was debriefed by a lieutenant instead of Williams . Williams had been killed when a rocket struck a mess hall . <p> Soon Michael was back with his company , drinking scotch and telling Cooper and Blaine , who had just come in from a month in the bush , how he 'd killed the brigadier with one shot . <p> Now he was on his way to Singapore . He planned to spend a week with some girl . And he 'd return for the last six months of his tour refreshed , his mind washed clean of those troubling Rubensesque images of women with huge breasts and rosy nipples and plump pudenda covered with light brown hair . <p> Michael spent most of the time on the plane asleep . When he woke briefly from time to time , the infantrymen were speaking of bad patrols or dead friends . Everyone talked with the nervous ease of the temporarily safe . <p> Cooper shook him awake for the landing . Below he saw the blue sea and then the city and houses with red tile roofs amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind he houses ? " Cooper asked . <p> " Badminton courts , " Michael said . " Slopes are big on badminton . " <p> Michael had read about the city in a travel book one of the Red Cross girls had given him . <p> " Michael , you gon na play badminton with the slopes ? " Blaine asked . <p> Michael laughed . <p> " It 's tennis he plays , " Cooper said . <p> Michael looked down at the houses again . He did n't see any tennis courts . Singapore had public grass courts  --  at the YMCA . He was on his college team . He 'd played on grass only once , in Tuscaloosa , Alabama . He imagined the springy feeling of the grass court beneath his feet . <p> As the plane banked , he saw the green square of the Botanical Gardens . They 'd preserved a section of the rain forest that had once covered the entire island . <p> " Look at that , " Blaine said . " The slopes have got their own jungle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd cut it down , " Cooper said . <p> Michael explained how the gardens were established by the British . They grew orchids and did research in rubber production . <p> " I do n't care about no flowers or rubber trees , " Cooper said . " I 've come to Singapore to fuck myself to death . " <p> They all laughed . <p> They were met with hot towels at the army reception station . The army had rented entire hotels for the troops and staffed them with girls , who were periodically inspected for venereal disease . The soldiers were warned not to bring uninspected girls to their rooms . The girls were required to carry medical cards and present them upon demand . <p> " I never thought the army would be running brothels , " Michael observed . <p> Cooper laughed . " Whorehouses , " he said . " That 's what we got in Birmingham . " Cooper was from Alabama . <p> " They do it so we can fight , " Blaine said . " If they did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syph . " <p> Blaine produced a set of pictures . The pictures were all of the same girl . Sometimes she was completely naked ; sometimes she was partially clothed . In all of them she was smiling . This was Blaine 's second leave in Singapore . He and the girl had been writing to each other . <p> " She 'd be mad at you , " Cooper said . " Showing everybody those pictures . " <p> Blaine laughed . " Naw , she do n't care , " he said . " A whore ca n't afford to be sensitive . Are all he girls in Birmingham sensitive like that " <p> Cooper laughed . " Let me see that first one again , " he asked . <p> After watching a slide show of four different hotels that featured swimming pools , tailor shops , and bars , they picked one and boarded a bus . Cooper and Blaine talked about girls , some trick that Blaine 's girl could do . Cooper was laughing . Michael thought of how good the girl 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning to her and clean sheets . <p> Michael bought a Malaysian girl named Susu for the week . It was n't going to be a quick , semiprivate affair in a boom-boom room . And her English was good , so they could talk . The hotel was an excellent one . He could be in Memphis for a football weekend at the Peabody Hotel . <p> He lay on the bed and watched her take off her clothes . She stood beside the bed and smiled at him . <p> " You like me , sergeant " she asked . <p> They 'd given him the third stripe for killing the brigadier . He reached out and pulled her down onto the bed . He rolled on top of her , and she put her hands on him to guide him into her . Her fingers were callused . He supposed she must be a farm girl who had come to the city to make money off the Americans . <p> She ran her fingers over the head of his cock . He expected himself to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and onto his back . She took him in her mouth . He closed his eyes . <p> He found himself thinking not of he girl but of Mississippi , of the Delta . He was going into the autumn woods between the levee and the river to hunt deer . It was a gray day , a light rain falling , and he was sitting in the back of a pickup . He smelled cigar smoke and mud and water . <p> She was on top of him now . He felt her wetness against the head of his cock . For a moment she had him inside her , but as she began to move he slipped out . She lay down on him , stretched out her full length against his body . He felt his heart pounding . <p> " Sleep , " she murmured . " You sleep . You are tired from the war . " <p> And maybe that was it , he thought . <p> He wrapped his arms around her and slept . <p> When he woke it was dark outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine and smoking a cigarette . She was still naked . She smiled at him and put the magazine on a table . He looked at the hair between her legs and expected to feel himself become hard . Instead he felt nothing . His hear was pounding ; he felt desire for the girl sing in his blood . But it was as if his cock were separated from the rest of his body . <p> She lay down beside him and repeated what she 'd done in the morning . She sucked on him , running her tongue over his cock and taking his balls in her mouth until she lay on her back on the bed beside him , breathing hard , as if they 'd actually made love . <p> " You rest , " she said . " You sleep . Forget the war . " <p> He did n't think he needed to forget the war . He did n't think that was it at all . He wondered what explanation Captain Williams might have given him for what was happening . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes and slept . <p> He woke to the smell of coffee . It was light outside the window . She 'd ordered breakfast from room service . They ate omelets and drank big glasses of orange juice . He ordered himself a Bloody Mary from the bar . She did n't drink . After the drink he felt good and loose , the way it felt to bring up the telescopic sight on a target , to know he was looking at a dead man through the scope . <p> " Do you know Warrant Officer Adams ? " she asked . <p> He shook his head . <p> " I met him here , " she said . " Every week he sent me flowers . He said he would be back . Then the flowers stopped . Perhaps he was killed . " <p> " It 's hard to say , " he said . <p> " Could you find out " <p> He imagined the list of the dead some computer kept in Saigon . <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming back to Singapore . " <p> After breakfast they took a bath together . He soaped her breasts and opened her with his fingers . He expected to make love to her in the tub , but nothing happened . He remembered himself lying on the leaves , his hard cock in his hand and then the sharp smell of semen . He wondered if something had happened to him during that week , something so terrible that he 'd forgotten it , but his body had remembered and was now betraying him . His most vivid memories were the wet smell of the forest and that white tablecloth , brilliant amid the green . <p> They lay on the bed together . His skin felt fresh and clean for the first time in months . That jungle stink was gone . Only a small patch of a white fungus remained on the left side of his groin . It itched , but he 'd resisted the urge to scratch it . <p> And she worked on him , this time he thought with a sense of exasperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer unfamiliar to him . He slept again and woke to a limp cock . He tried to apply his conversation with Captain Williams to what was happening , but that yielded only confusion . He did n't know enough ; he had n't read any of those books . All he knew for certain was his inability to make love to the girl and an overwhelming feeling of panic because he was three days into his leave . <p> He took her to lunch at a restaurant and to a double feature . It was two Chinese gangster movies set in Hong Kong . She loved the gunfights and the car chases . <p> They returned to the hotel . Cooper was in the lobby shop that sold custom-tailored suits . He was being fitted for a suit while his girl watched . <p> " Ai n't this great , man ! " Cooper yelled at him . <p> Michael did n't stop to talk . He went up to his room with Susu . There they spent another frustrating afternoon . He decided that he needed to relax ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Other soldiers have been like you , " she said . " Before they left they were tigers . " <p> In the morning he ate a leisurely breakfast with her by the pool . <p> They were the only people up besides a solitary soldier swimming laps . The soldier finished his workout , and they were left alone . <p> " Today you will be a tiger , " she said . <p> He wondered what kind of work she 'd done to put those calluses on her hands and how she 'd learned to speak such good English . He supposed they studied English in school from an early age . <p> They went into town where he bought a seersucker suit at a good men 's shop . He imagined himself wearing it to Memphis . It would be cool in the heat . The alterations were made while they waited . He bought two button-down shirts  --  one white and one blue  --  a striped tie , a good leather belt , and a pair of English shoes . It was how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tie and wore the suit out of the shop . <p> She was wearing a silk dress with a slit up one leg . It had gold threads woven into the fabric and a dragon embroidered on the bodice . The people at the shop knew she was a whore . He 'd noticed the way they looked at her . In a women 's shop he bought her a simple black dress , the sort of dress a girl might wear to dinner in Memphis . <p> When they went out on the street together , it was almost as if she were one of those girls from Greenville or Yazoo City he 'd taken to football games in Memphis . And he recalled lying naked on summer nights with a girl on a blanket spread on the levee , the fields stretching away from them like a dark sea , <p> He bought a tennis racket and shorts and a pair of shoes at a shop . Then they took a cab to the YMCA in the center of town , where the street made a circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully smooth green grass . <p> He found someone to play and hired ball boys . She sat in the shade and drank orange squashes . He liked the grass . It suited his game . He 'd been taught to hit the ball flat and hard . He had a good volley and serve and overhead . He played until it was nearly dark and they had taken down all the nets but his . His body had the pleasant fatigued feeling play always produced . <p> She bathed him while he drank scotch . He got out of the tub . She toweled him dry . He looked down at his cock hanging limp between his legs . She lay in bed beside him and told him about working on her father 's farm . She explained to him how dry rice was planted and harvested . And how they tapped rubber trees for cash to buy cigarettes , coffee , and ice cream . <p> " My father killed a man and was sent to prison , " she said . " My brothers are children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make money so the family could survive . This was her first year . He expected that in a few years she would be spending her wages on opium . That was what was waiting for her . She would begin taking opium . Then she would become useless as a prostitute . He imagined her dying , lost in an opium dream . <p> He went to sleep with her in his arms . She was wearing a new sort of perfume . He drifted off to sleep surrounded by that sweet scent . <p> When he woke in the morning , she was sitting in the chair wearing the new dress . <p> " Come to bed , " he said . <p> For the first time since he 'd arrived , he felt rested . But he tried not to think of his cock . He wanted to be surprised that everything had returned to normal . <p> She laughed and shook her head . " Tonight you will truly be a tiger , " she said . She explained that she was taking him to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The powder would restore his potency . " The teeth are the best , " she said . " Others sell inferior bones . Mr. Tung can be trusted . " <p> He had heard of the belief Asians had in rhinoceros horn as an aphrodisiac , but he had n't known about tigers . <p> " Come to bed , " he said . <p> " No , I am dressed , " she said . " You get up . Come with me . " <p> Reluctantly he did as she asked . As he shaved he regarded himself in the mirror . He was tanned from the tropical sun . He looked healthy . He felt good . Nothing permanent could be wrong with him . <p> She took him into the heart of the old Chinese section of the city on Upper Nankin . Street . The streets were bordered by shops , the smell of incense and food in the air . <p> Mr. Tung turned out to be a young man . His father had recently died , and he 'd taken over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation in a mixture of Malaysian and English . He assured her that the powder they were buying was made from one of the eyeteeth . Michael wondered what Mr. Tung thought of a Malaysian prostitute and an American soldier showing up at his shop to buy an aphrodisiac . But if Mr. Tung had these thoughts , he was careful to hide them . He smiled and gave Michael instructions for the use of the powder . It came in a paper packet that Mr. Tung had tied at the top with a piece of string . <p> " Take it three times today , " Mr. Tung said . " Take it when you are happy . " <p> They went to the Tiger Balm Gardens and looked at the statues representing figures from Chinese mythology and fed peanuts to the monkeys . He took the first dose dissolved in an orange squash as they sat on the grass and watched the dominant male casually and quickly mount the receptive members of his harem . <p> The second dose he took with scotch at the bar in the Raffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a good white wine . Afterwards they wandered about the city . They went to a museum where there were models of Malaysian villages and stuffed animals of the rain forest . In a glass case was a king cobra fully twenty feet long , its head raised to the height of Michael 's knee . <p> In the evening they went to the ballet . The Leningrad Ballet Company performed at an open-air theater . She had never seen a ballet before . He had been twice , once as a child in Memphis and the second time when the Russians came to Ole Miss . He wondered if Susu were watching the cocks of the young dancers , who with smiles on their faces made powerful , seemingly effortless leaps . <p> After the performance he took the remainder of the packet with coffee at a cafe . <p> " Tomorrow you will be a tiger , " she said . <p> That night he went to sleep with his arms around her . He was n't expecting much from the powdered tooth , if that was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake with a hard cock . He realized for the first time that what he really needed was to know he would not have to go back to the war . He pictured himself in hiding with her on a sampan in the harbor where they would make love as the boar . swayed in the wash from the ships . <p> In the morning he woke early . This would be his last full day . And he knew that he was going to get on the plane with the others . She was still asleep . He got out of bed carefully so as not to wake her and looked out the window . The soldier was swimming laps . Michael stood and watched him for a long time . The man was an excellent swimmer . He took the same number of breaths on each lap . <p> Michael dressed quietly in his new clothes and left Susu in the room . He walked downtown and looked at the green expanse of dew-covered grass at the YMCA . Later in the morning they 'd put up the nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nietzsche and De Sade and a dictionary . He wanted to know what Captain Williams had known . All morning and into the afternoon he sat in a cafe and read . But hours later he found himself even more confused and overwhelmed by De Sade 's hatred of women . Much of Nietzsche did n't make sense to him . In neither writer did he find anything that might explain what had happened to him on the mountains and what was happening o him with Susu . <p> He left the books on a table and took a cab to the Botanical Gardens . A sign informed him that tours were over for the day . No one was at the sentry box at the entrance . He walked through the gate and up the road toward a group of tile-roofed buildings . On his right orchids grew in unbelievable profusion . Off to his left was an expanse of lawn that ended at a grove of rubber trees . Beyond the orderly rows of trees towered the canopy of the rain forest . <p> He walked across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the grove came a tapping sound . Someone was incising the trees with a heavy knife to allow the latex to ooze out . Susu had told him of helping her father tap their trees . <p> For a moment he paused and considered going to watch the workers , but instead he walked along one of the corridors formed by the trees . The rubber trees ended at the green wall of the forest . <p> He crossed a gravel road and stepped into the forest . It was much darker in the triple-canopy forest than beneath the rubber trees . He heard the faraway sound of falling water . It felt good to be alone . <p> For a few minutes he walked steadily until he reached the base of a huge tree , its buttressed roots higher than his head . Then he took off his clothes because he knew a walk in the forest would ruin them . He folded each article carefully and laid it in a pile at the base of one of the roots . He coiled the belt and placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty bed . He imagined Cooper and Blaine waking to make love to their girls on this , the last day of their leave . He walked off , his naked body feeling loose and easy and the leaves soft beneath his feet . Somewhere in the forest there might be a place where wild orchids grew . He decided he would walk until he found orchids . Then he 'd return to where he 'd left his clothes . He 'd dress and take a cab back to the city . <p> A bird began to sing from high in the canopy , repeating the same notes over and over , and he suddenly began to fear , as he followed the sound into the heart of the forest , that he would never go home . That one day he would make a mistake because of his inattention , his mind caught up in a reverie of some girl , and the enemy would kill him . <p> The land rose . Overhead he heard the sound of an airplane making a landing approach . Then the land dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the small waterfall that was the source of the sound of falling water . <p> He sat beside the stream . He took himself in his hand and felt the pleasant rush of blood into his cock . He gazed at himself and tried to understand how it could happen here and no in the hotel . He thought of Susu , but . for some reason he found it impossible to call up a picture of her . All he could manage were fragments : a breast , a leg , her eyes . So he gave up on her and worked on himself in a sort of desperate frenzy . He came almost immediately . <p> Then he swam in a pool and stood beneath the waterfall , letting the water pound against the back o his neck . He stood beneath the water a long time until he was certain the smell of the semen was off his body . He sat on a rock while the sun , which shot down in the gap in the forest caused by the stream , quickly dried his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find his clothes . He 'd dress and go back to the hotel where he did no think he would make love to Susu . The next day he would board the plane with Cooper and Blaine ; he would return to hunt men on the mountains . It was going to be difficult because he believed that time would lie heavy on him . His thoughts of girls would make the days pass slowly . But he refused to believe that love and death were intertwined . Captain Williams had been wrong . Love was something separate from death . <p> He left the stream and started back , carefully picking his way among the trees , watching the ground for snakes . There was an abundance of cobras in this forest . He told himself that if he lived carefully and prudently on those green mountains he would return to Mississippi and one summer evening put on the clothes he had bought in Singapore and pick up the girl he loved in Greenville or Indianola and drive across the dark , flat land toward the lights of Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
