Dr. Laura Bowman seems in a perpetual Burma daze . In 1988 Laura ( Patricia Arquette ) , the heroine of Beyond Rangoon , is with a group of tourists who want to get out of Burma before the thugs who run the place start killing everyone . But Laura has not recovered from a personal trauma back home , and when her group leaves she just ... stays there . It 's a pretty region  --  like the Mekong Delta in the mid- ' 60s . Now if only she can find an escort . Why , here 's an amiable native ( U Aung Ko ) . " Hello , " he says , in effect , " I 'm an illegal guide in a military dictatorship , and I 'd like to plop you into a genocidal civil war . " " Hello , " she virtually replies , " I 'm a shell-shocked ninny . Let 's go . " <P> The history of Myanmar , as Burma is now called , resonates with melodrama and tragedy . The heroic battle of Aung San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonviolent resistance against the ruling junta , is surely worth a movie . But in Hollywood the problems of one little country  --  or one big country with little brown people  --  do n't amount to a hill of unsold scripts . The Burmese must have a Caucasian mediator , Laura , whose sufferings illuminate those of the locals . <P> Director John Boorman , an artist-adventurer with an eye for pictorial rapture and social turmoil , brought this sort of scenario alive in The Emerald Forest . Not so here , where he lapses into banal visual stereotyping : the rebels are thin , winsome , saintly , while the nasty soldiers have bad skin and potbellies . <P> Cast at the last minute ( after Meg Ryan left to make another American-twit-abroad epic , French Kiss ) , Arquette can do little but whine and pine in an impossible role . And the film simply forfeits belief with its notion that Laura , who stumbles through Burma like a girl in a monster movie after she 's seen the giant ants , is a physician . She hardly seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
