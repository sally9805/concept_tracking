How to get the best plan for your budget . // If you 've considered upgrading your old kitchen lately , but find the array of design and product options a bit overwhelming , take heart . The design process , though exacting , is not as mysterious as it might appear . The space and your budget will probably limit the options . Your family 's lifestyle and personal tastes will also narrow the field . While this may sound discouraging , it 's really not . The space you own , the life you live , your stylistic likes and dislikes-these make the best foundation for a uniquely personal and workable kitchen . Finding help When a kitchen requires only cosmetic or modest mechanical improvements to make it new again , chances are you can do that work yourself . The more extensive the job , however , the more likely it is that you 'll need professional tradespeople and a trained kitchen designer to see you through it . How you proceed is directly related to how much work needs to be done and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes-and the inclination to handle it yourself . The most popular approach is to hire a kitchen-remodeling outfit that is nothing more than a design/build contracting firm specializing in kitchens , and usually in baths too . In these cases , the contractor employs a trained kitchen designer , who melds your space with your needs to create the best design for you . The cost of the design-the blueprint-is often waived when you sign the build contract . The contractor then manages the job from start to finish , using subcontractors as needed . This approach is popular because it works well for most people . And the busier we are , the better this option appears . It does have its limits , however . In searching for the most competitive , competent design/ build firm , you can end up with as many plans and product lines as contractors . The bidding process requires an appleswith-apples comparison , which tends to complicate the matter a bit further . It 's not an insurmountable problem , but it requires an upfront discussion with everyone concerned . For this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target price and take bids on the work . Another approach is to commission a plan by a registered architect . An architect 's plan will almost always cost more than one generated by a builder , because a builder has a hundred ways to recoup the design costs . The plan , in the builder 's case , is an admission ticket . For the architect , the plan is the actual event . An architect offers two clear advantages : He or she is generally better trained and produces just one plan , with a detailed product list . You then hand copies to a variety of builders , certain that all will be bidding on the same goods and services . And finally , you might act as your own general contractor , hiring and coordinating subcontractors , and perhaps doing some of the work yourself . While some people are actually good at this , the rest of us do n't have the time , patience , knowledge or organizational skills needed to do it . And , you 'd probably need time away from your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for quality control , call backs and arranging warranty work . In the end , it 's often better to stick to what you do best and pay a general contractor to do the same . You should expect a 15 to 20% markup on all goods and services to pay for the general contractor . Where to begin No matter how you choose to complete your kitchen upgrade , you should start by looking at as many kitchens and kitchen products as you can . Keep a file and stuff it with magazine clippings , product literature , prices and your own ideas . Immerse yourself . Become a minor expert . It will all pay off , whether you do the work yourself or hire someone to do it . Many large home centers now have computer-aided drafting programs . Bring a simple drawing of your kitchen space , with critical dimensions noted , pick a cabinet type and have the computer operator run the numbers for you . What you 'll get is a plan and an elevation view of your kitchen with your choice of components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that drafting is not designing , and it 's certainly not building , but the resulting pictures can help you refine your ideas , assign priorities and approximate material costs . Lifestyle influences While it 's easy to overstate lifestyle differences-kitchens generally have more in common than individualshow you live should influence some of your choices . If you enjoy making bread , for example , a slightly elevated section of counter will make kneading dough more comfortable . If you make and freeze several days ' worth of meals at a time , then a refrigerator with a large , convenient freezer makes sense . If you shop for groceries only a couple of times a month , then increased pantry space should be a priority . If you prefer meat-andpotato meals , convenient pots-andpans storage and a first-rate oven are important . But if you favor convenience foods , a larger , carouselequipped microwave oven , which also offers convection heat for browning meats , is a good choice . Kitchen upgrades can range from $1000 to $50,000 and more . The low figure , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require do-it-yourself work . The high end , no matter how you spend it , will buy a whole lot of kitchen . Budqet facelifts If your kitchen is adequate in most respects , but is showing its age , a simple facelift may do . This could entail new flooring , improved lighting , refaced or refurbished cabinet fronts and perhaps a new countertop , sink and faucet . These improvements typically fall in the $1000 to $3000 category , with costs keyed to material selection , the size of the space and the amount of cabinet frontage . Many older homes have site-built cabinets , which were often made with solid pine or fir face-frame lumber and pine or birch plywood doors and drawer fronts . Despite the economic lumber , these cabinets are often better built than today 's low- to midrange modular units . Moreover , they often include space and shape accommodations and storage features unique to each kitchen . Unless you 're really set on a completely new kitchen , painting these quality cabinets is often a good choice , and can be completed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer and door pulls , and you 'll be surprised at the improvement . All you 'll need to do is degloss the existing paint or stain . The best approach is to scuff the exposed areas with a palm sander and hand sand the tight spots . Stripping and restaining is another option , but it is tedious and messy work that can tie up your kitchen for days-if not weeks-and subject your family to unpleasant and even noxious chemical fumes . Still , if your cabinets are an attractive hardwood , and the layout is still acceptable to you , stripping and refinishing can be a real moneysaver . Another economical solution is to have your stained cabinets refurbished . The Kitchen Tune-Up Comnany ( 131 N. Roosevelt . Aberdine . SD 57401 ) specializes in refurbishing cabinets that are in good overall condition but are beginning to show signs of wear . Using patented cleaners , colorizers and finishes , workers are able to remove years of accumulated grease and grime , restain worn areas around handles and drawer pulls , repair scratches , reglue raised-panel doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . The results can be quite dramatic , and the cost is usually $300 to $500 , depending on the size of the task . Kitchen Tune-Up has 300 franchises in 40 states . For the nearest dealer , call 80-333-6385 . And finally , when cabinets are structurally sound , but are too beatup , too dark or just too ugly , you might consider having them refaced with hardwood veneers and fitted with replacement doors and drawer fronts . You 'll find this service in the Yellow Pages , with prices ranging from $1000 to $2000 for a small to midsize kitchen . Replacement doors , drawer fronts and veneers are also carried by home centers and lumberyards . If you 're patient , you might do this work yourself , at a substantial savings and with few tools . The veneers come with heat-sensitive adhesive . Just degloss the cabinet faces , cut the veneer strips to length and apply them with a household iron . Then trim , stain and seal the veneer and install the new doors and drawer fronts . Prices will vary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with iron-on adhesive , priced at $4.60 each . We also found 151/2 x 22 1/2-in. recessedpanel red-oak doors , already stained and sealed , for $16.99 . A raised-panel equivalent was priced at $22.99 . Beyond the quick fix As reasonable as these options are , they 're not for every kitchen or everyone . If improved efficiency , increased capacity and a dramatic change in appearance are what you 're after , cosmetic changes simply wo n't do . In fact , many kitchen upgrades require complete tearouts and may require mechanical , electrical and structural changes . If your kitchen is really cramped or dated , and you can afford an entirely new kitchen , then that 's the route to take . Structural changes In many cases , kitchens are just too small for any real improvement in space management . Of course , you can add space by building an addition . Although appropriate in some cases , additions are always costly and not always feasible . For that reason , it pays to consider the less expensive alternatives . What you do n't spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better cabinets , lights , counters , fixtures , flooring and appliances . If you live in a single-story home , one option is to bump out an exterior wall by 24 in . In this scenario , a section of the existing wall is cut out and replaced by a laminated header to support the roof . The old floor is then cantilevered outward and new exterior walls are built along the perimeter of the new floor . The whole extension is covered with a small roof and you have a lot of extra space without paying for a foundation . Assuming a 24in. bump-out , the new space could hold a bank of cabinets and appliances , giving you 2 ft. of wiggle room in front of them . While it 's impossible to fix an exact price , $3500 to $5500 might do it , which is one-third the cost of a modest room addition . In other cases , the wall enclosing a small breakfast nook can be removed , extending the length of the kitchen . A breakfast bar over a peninsula cabinet would occupy much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dine-and-dash eating habits . In some situations , the mere illusion of more space can make the difference . By widening the opening of a U-shape kitchen , or by providing alternate access to a dining area , the impression of openness and the benefits of rerouted traffic can make a kitchen feel bigger . Similarly , moving a door can open up many new layout possibilities . These alternatives are very affordable . Sometimes merely cutting a rectangular opening in the top half of the wall that separates a kitchen and living or dining room will help . At the very least , it will allow the cook to feel less confined . Anyone who has ever thrown a party knows that cooking can be a spectator sport , so open it up and invite them in . When it comes to creating open space , nothing can compete with removing a wall between your kitchen and dining room . While the results of this choice are dramatic , the cost can be pretty low , often as little as a few hundred dollars . But it pays to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can harbor plumbing , heating and electrical equipment that must be moved and can easily prove to be a bigger challenge than you want to take on . Electrical requirements Almost all kitchens more than 10 years old are underpowered . Electricians and builders of old simply did not fathom the number of large and small appliances found in most kitchens today . Depending on the age of your house , you can expect only one or two receptacle circuits , with illumination pulled from a general lighting circuit powering all ceiling lights . Safety is another important issue , as most older kitchens do not have ground-fault protection . In a complete kitchen overhaul , upgrading the wiring is fairly easy , given enough room for new breakers in the service panel . Lacking enough room for expansion , a panel and service upgrade is a must . The job will run $600 to $1200 in most markets , and is always money well spent . As for powering a new kitchen , give the refrigerator its own 15-amp circuit . The microwave , too , could benefit from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is serving a spikeproducing microwave oven . If your kitchen is large . try to power the small-appliance receptacles with two 20-amp circuits , with the circuit serving the sink area protected by a GFCI receptacle or breaker . Codes now require groundfault protection within 6 ft. of the sink . Island and peninsula cabinets must also be wired with receptacles , with " wet " islands requiring GFCIs . In addition to these circuits , the dishwasher may need its own circuit , while a food disposer and hot-water dispenser might share a circuit , depending on local codes . When in doubt , and when possible , provide more , not less . Also , electric ranges , cook-tops and ovens require dedicated 240-volt circuits . Lighting basics Many kitchens are poorly lighted . The light from a single fixture centered overhead is usually blocked by your own body as you work at the counter . Wall cabinets also block overhead light , leaving the primary food-prep spaces darker than the rest of the room . And it 's not just the age of the kitchen that matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re- . : quire at least 100% more light to read than they did when they were 20 . The solution ? More versatile , task-oriented light in more places . Fluorescent undercabinet lights can make a big difference and cost very little to install and operate . Expect a 1 X 4 X 18 - In. ' fixture to cost less than $25 . Not every ca inet will need a fluorescent light , but those nearest your primary workspaces should have them . Recessed 120-volt incandescent fixtures can also brighten a workspace inexpensively and do double duty when controlled by a dimmer switch . At full power , they 're task lights , at one-third power they 're accent lights . When shopping for recessed fixtures , opt for the slightly more expensive zero-clearance models if you live in a single-story house . These can stand direct contact with attic insulation . While 120-volt incandescent fixtures are still popular , the tiny but mighty low-voltage halogen and incandescent alternatives are gaining ground pretty quickly . Used primarily as accent lights , their advantages are compact design , energy efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , while incandescents are always warmer in color . Some fixtures are so compact that they fit invisibly beneath wall cabinets and even inside dinnerware and curio cabinets . Some fixtures have their own voltagereducing transformers , while in other cases , several fixtures are ganged together . A 100-watt transformer , for example , could serve five 20-watt lamps . Some of the small fixtures come in striplight form , with lamps in fixed positions , while miniature tracks allow a variety of twist-in lamp holders . Most applications blend exposed spots with concealed puck lights ( the shape and size of a hockey puck ) for the best coverage . The disadvantages ? These small lights are expensive , often costing two to three times that of standard incandescent fixtures . Halogen lamps also burn very hot , so care is needed in keeping them away from combustibles . Some manufacturers substitute zenon for halogen to reduce the heat output for some applications . Give as much thought and planning to lighting as you can . Most retail lighting dealers will be able to lead you through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive kitchen remodels require some changes in plumbing , heating and ventilation piping . Unless your changes will be minor , this work requires the assistance of a professional . All perimeter-wall drain lines must be vented through the roof . If you 're lucky , you might be able to tap an existing vent pipe . but manv older kitchens were inadequately vented from the start . One sure sign that a kitchen is not vented is an S-trap under the sink . Because of its shape , an - trap pipe can not be vented and should not be utilized . If you install an island cabinet with a sink , the drain line serving that sink can not be vented conventionally . In this case , an automatic-vent device or a barometric ( loop ) vent is required . A licensed plumber will know which is best for your application . Changes in the heating system are usually minor , but new exhaustvent requirements are often complicated . If at all possible , choose a range hood that vents to the open air , with a capacity of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install a cook-top with a griddle/grill combination and a downdraft exhaust vent , be sure to check the basement ceiling for clearance room . Floor joists that run parallel to the preferred vent direction will allow you to install the vent between joists , and avoid dropping the ceiling . In either case , you 'll need access to the joists , so a finished ceiling can really complicate matters . Choices and more choices The basic behind-the-scenes requirements of your kitchen remodel can be pretty straightforward . Small changes to the structure and the mechanical systems do n't often require much thought because usually the choices are n't that complicated . But nothing could be further from the truth for the kitchen components that everyone sees , namely the cabinets , counters , appliances and flooring . In these areas , the options can be absolutely overwhelming . For example , it may take you just a moment to decide you 'd like laminate countertops . But how long will it take to choose between the hundreds of colors available ?
