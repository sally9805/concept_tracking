<p> Spinach is culinary litmus , distinguishing an inspired cook from a kitchen hack and Popeye from Brutus every time it 's served . Its name alone can make a contented youngster cringe and send responsible adults running for cover . Yet its natural affinity for anything from garlic to ham hocks has made it , and other green leafy vegetables , some of the most widely eaten , if not well appreciated , side dishes on the American table . <p> The challenge to cooking spinach , and practically any other dark green leaf , is the ingredients ' tendency toward bitterness . From the acrid aroma of simmering cabbage to the overt bitter bite of broccoli rabe and chicory , the tendency to love or loath these vegetables depends largely on one 's reaction to bitterness . <p> Our palates are built to reject bitter foods , a wise bit of engineering given that they are often an indication of harmful alkaloids present . Nonetheless , we have come to accept some bitter flavors , like quinine and caffeine in low concentrations , usually by sweetening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , fruit or dairy products , or by balancing the bitterness with other strong flavors . <p> The same solutions can be , and have been , used with greens to make them more palatable to diners , who would otherwise find them overly bitter . Collard , mustard , beet and broccoli greens are typically cooked with the sweet aromatics of smoked meats , a fruity olive oil or a pungent jolt of garlic . We serve sweet-and-sour cabbage , creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts with cheese sauce . We toss radicchio and escarole with creamy dressings and pungent vinaigrettes , or shadow the sharpness of braised endive with shades of lemon juice , white wine , shallots and chicken broth . <p> The bitterest of all greens are those in the chicory and In this stage the vegetable is relatively mild , although with a perceptible bitter aftertaste . As the plant matures and becomes greener , through exposure to sunlight , the bitter flavors increase . <p> For that reason growers of endive and chicory " blanch " the plants . In gardening terms , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible until harvest . Belgian endives are covered with soil to keep them out of the sun , and broad-leaved escarole or curly endives are tied so that only their outer leaves turn green and bitter . The smaller leaves , protected in the center of the head , have a more subtle flavor . Therefore , greenness in these vegetables is not only a sign of freshness , but one of toughness and bitterness as well . <p> In addition to buying paler specimens , you can temper bitterness during preparations by controlling the amount of water and heat used in cooking . Soaking endive or chicory will increase bitterness . Therefore wash these vegetables quickly and dry them well . <p> Soon after they start cooking , the bitter components in the vegetables will be released and become more overt . Eventually this bitterness will dissipate , but in the interim it will become more pronounced . This means the most palatable ways of serving bitter greens is raw in salads , barely wilted in a flavorful mixture of herbs , acids and oil , or braised until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens al dente unless a puckered palate is your idea of a good time . <p> The following recipes include several for spinach , allowed by individual recipes for less common greens . The cooked spinach recipes are written for both fresh and frozen spinach . Use whichever is better at your market . Since spinach freezes well , and these products are processed when the leaves are quite fresh , frozen spinach is frequently of higher quality than the fresh spinach available in the produce section of the market . Unless the spinach is being served raw , the frozen product may be a better choice . <p> Spinach With Capers <p> ( 4 or 5 servings ) <p> 2 tablespoons minced onion <p> 1 teaspoon minced garlic <p> 2 tablespoons butter <p> 1 tablespoon nonpareil capers <p> 20 ounces defrosted frozen chopped spinach or 2 pounds fresh spinach , washed , stemmed and chopped <p> 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice <p> Salt and pepper to taste <p> In a large saute pan over medium heat , cook the onion and garlic in the butter until soft .
