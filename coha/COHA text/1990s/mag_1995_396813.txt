Hood River , Oregon , is the only ski town on earth where wind calls the shots . And at sunset on a summer afternoon , as the snowy cone of Mount Hood towers over the horizon , it seems as if every card-carrying skier on earth has chased the breeze to one place . On a highway shoulder along the Columbia River Gorge , hundreds of cars , trucks , and vans  --  their bumpers plastered with ski and snowboard stickers  --  are shoehorned into makeshift parking lanes . Around the vehicles , everyone is scrambling against time . Men and women , broad-shouldered and tanned , shimmy into brightly colored wet suits and hustle equipment  --  sailboards and masts , harnesses and helmets  --  to the riverside , rushing to ride the rising gale . It 's all action and movement , a deep-powder morning gone temperate . As the wind continues toward a howl , the crowd 's collective energy can be scooped up like syrup . Doug Coombs surveys the scene and laughs . He points down the beach , isolating a few dawdlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace instead of hyperspeed . " When the wind comes up , you can always tell locals from visitors , " he says , slowly tugging neoprene overalls across the brown slope of his shoulders . " The locals are n't hurrying ; to them , this is just another day . " Doug and his wife , Emily Gladstone Coombs , count themselves among the lucky locals . Doug , who won the World Extreme Skiing Championships in ' ' 91 and ' ' 93 , and Emily , herself the top-placing woman in the World Extremes in ' ' 92 , spend ski seasons running their Steep Skiing Camps in Jackson Hole and their heli-skiing guide service in Alaska . But they spend their summers in the Gorge , living and training from a rustic , lakeside cabin they purchased outside the town of Hood River in 1991 . Looking up from her rigging , Emily , sun-freckled and strawberry-blond , points along the beach . " There 's Victor , " she says , identifying Victor Roy , a former pro racer who now coaches at Cooper Spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Sean here ? " Doug asks . Emily nods to the river , at the orange sail belonging to Sean Aiken , a snowboarder turned pro windsurfer . " Out already , " she answers . And there are hundreds  --  maybe thousands  --  of other ski types who summer here as well : gear regs and action photographers , World Cup racers and skiwear designers . Coombs lifts his assembled rig and makes for the shoreline . Hundreds of bright sails pound back and forth across the wind-driven whitecaps . The sailors carve the stiletto-thin boards like surfers ; they do skiers ' leaps , slamming off watery lips ; sometimes they twist from earth altogether , looping through the sky like snowboarders . Just before lifting his sail to join the buffeting throng , Coombs turns to me . " This is why we live here , " he says , grinning at the river and 11,235-foot Mount Hood in the distance . " We ski until Labor Day . We sail every afternoon . We hike , go mountain-biking , hang out with friends . For us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the right words as the wind seduces his thoughts , " for us in summer , the Gorge is , uh ... the Gorge ... aw , hell , just say it 's perfect . " A hundred years ago , had you told Hood River 's dusty loggers and pioneers that their town would someday be filled with Day-Glo athletes and banana-nut muffins , they 'd have tied you to a felled Douglas fir and rolled you into the Columbia . Back then , orchards and timber were Hood River 's main industries . The place 's dew-kissed combination of mountain and seaside climates , plus the mighty river flowing at its feet , imparted a rough , magical richness to Hood River 's dramatic landscape . Local orchards and logging operations on the surrounding mountainsides thrived , and soon fruit canneries , sawmills , and grand Victorian homes rose along Oak Street , Hood River 's main drag . The tow was a regular stopover for boats transporting passengers and goods . And when the transcontinental railroad was slapped through town , a big-time future of fruit-growing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the past century , Hood River was slow to change with them . As timber demand dwindled , local sawmills shut their doors . In the 1930s , when the Columbia itself was dammed , the river traffic that Hood River had counted on for dollars dried up , too . Hood River 's thriving pear orchards make it one-of the foremost fruit producers on earth , but refrigerated trucking torpedoed the canning business , and the local economy along with it . By the 1970s , unemployment was high and Hood River 's population was a fraction of what it had been 60 years earlier . Some days , in fact , it seemed the only living thing on the streets of Hood River was a freak , uncontrollable wind , a typhoon that rose every afternoon and often tore through town at 60 or 70 miles an hour . That wind , it turned out , would be Hood River 's salvation . The physics behind the wind are simple . They begin with the broad Columbia , the longest navigable waterway west of the Rockies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the river passes through the Cascades on its way to the Pacific , it runs through the Columbia Gorge , a steep , 85-mile-long canyon whose cliffs rise straight up from water . At the center of the Gorge sits the town of Hood River , named for a Mount Hood-runoff tributary that joins the Columbia nearby . Just east of town , the high desert of Oregon 's central plateau begins . To the west , the Cascades keep the Pacific 's cool , damp ocean air at bay . Each day as the desert heats up and its air rises , the heavier , colder air from the coast rushes through the canyon , which acts like a natural wind tunnel . Other times , when the desert is cold and the Pacific Coast is warm , the wind blows in the opposite direction . It 's this windy swinging door , plus the dawn of high-tech sailboarding , that brought renewal to town in the ' ' 80s . Lightning-fast , requiring balance and strength , sailboarding meshed exactly with the skiers ' need for summertime endorphin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wind-smitten skiers and snowboarders gravitated here and began to stay . They lived in trucks and vans , ate off camp stoves , did odd jobs when money got tight . Sail makers and sailboard manufacturers set up shop in the abandoned fruit canneries and warehouses , and entrepreneurs , seeing Hood River as the next Aspen , renovated the neglected Victorian buildings . Hood River became one of the world 's windsurfing hotbeds , and skiers started putting down roots . People like Jake Lombard , the heli-ski guide for Mike Wiegele who 's also an aerial stuntman . And Kim Reichhelm , the extreme skier , ex-pro racer , and proprietress of Women 's Ski Adventures . And freestyle great Nelson Carmichael , U.S. Ski Team racer Monique Pelletier ( who moved here from Aspen ) , and Mike Jacoby , one of the world 's top professional snowboarders . Before long , the storefronts along Oak Street again coursed with customers , and the old , carved-wood lobby of the Hood River Hotel was alive with travelers . Houses were selling into the six-figure range , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plied the river from dozens of beaches on the Oregon and Washington sides of the river . When the wind was n't blowing , they found other ways to get a rush : mountain-biking on old logging trails , climbing Mount Hood , kayaking the White Salmon River , and fishing the Deschutes . Soon the microbrewed beers , Isuzu Troopers , and foamy lattes of a 1990s sports town were as good as dialed in . In 1983 , Doug Coombs arrived in Hood River , having just quit his job as a geologist for a mining company . " They would n't let me take winters off to ski , " he says , " and I was more focused on skiing than geology . " Having been a boardsailor since his college days in the late ' ' 70s , Coombs was acquainted with the Gorge thanks to a couple of long weekends , and he simply showed up , planning to sail and sleep in his car until the ski season started . He found a job as a construction worker . " The guy I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Coombs says with a smile . " You know , when the wind got past 25 knots , I was gone . " The day 's sailing is over now , and Doug and Emily have convened with friends at The Northshore , a bar and restaurant in Bingen , on the Washington side of the bridge from Hood River . The energy so visible only a few hours ago has disappeared , blown away on the gale . In its place , everyone has a moony , languid peacefulness . Steely Dan drifts from the bar 's low ceiling . People talk , pick at their neighbors ' quesadillas , step to the bar for a fresh beer . They speak lovingly of the wind , of the way it rose , then promptly " turned off " at sunset . They speculate how it affected other beach along the Columbia , a waterway that has more varied zones than the largest ski area . Sitting across the table from Coombs , like a California-blond surfer in a 1960s Life magazine , is Sean Aiken . Formerly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windsurfing full-time in 1992 and never looked back . Now he leads the sail bum 's life , living out of his van at the Gorge . " I 'm still not sure how it happened , " he says . " Things were going great on snow . Then I picked up sailing  --  that was it . I learned here , then went to Maui . And I got to thinking : Do I want to spend winter in cold , wet snowboard gear on the Northwest 's boarding circuit , or warm on Maui ? So I called Burton and said : " Hey , sorry . ' ' " He pauses to munch a tortilla chip , then , thinking over his decision , says : " I feel kind of irresponsible about it .... " Emily reaches up and cuffs Aiken  --  bap  --  on the head . " Yeah , right , " she says , smiling . " You 're hooked . You 're a goner . Admit your weakness and be free . " Seated next to Coombs is Jim Conway , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alaska . The three have been best friends since their student days at Montana State University , when they ballasted the no-legendary band of Bridger Bowl skiers called The Ridge Hippies . But rather than take up a dicey ski career like his friends ' ' , Conway holds down a job as a Salt Lake City engineer , taking a five-month leave of absence during heli-ski season as well as long-weekend expeditions to the Gorge . He has to go home tomorrow . Now he looks around the room , seeing full-time pro skiers at summer roost , and thinks about the difference between his life and the lives of his friends . He 'll have a career long after his knees go south , but his chosen life clearly chafes a bit . He takes a sip of beer , a fork-load of dinner , and then the inequity ca n't be contained . " Sometimes in summer I sit in my office and think about the Gorge , " he finally says . " Once you get this lifestyle in your blood , if you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a ... a ... a bitter sailor . " Another afternoon , this time at Swell City , and Moe Dixon is taking a break . He sits beneath some trees , a fresh pinch of sunburn on his checks , sipping a bottle of Evian , With his fast smile , athlete 's build , and graying ponytail ringlets , he resembles Sammy Hagar , the lead singer for Van Halen . And , in fact , aside from having run ski-racing clinics at Vail , he 's renowned as Hood River 's town musician : His weekly " Moe Night " at the River City Saloon is a longtime local tradition . Dixon unzips his wet suit and looks around . The best windsurfing action is here on the Washington side of the river , and from where Dixon sits , he can see a few miles upriver along The Corridor , a popular stretch of beaches . Each beach has its own character  --  and set of characters . Swell City , with its private parking lot and sandy beach , is for yuppies , tourists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boulder field to enter the water , is home to the strong and reckless ; it 's nicknamed the Smashery for the frequent collisions among hotdoggers . Midway  --  also called Cheap Beach because there 's free parking  --  draws a big Utah crowd . " Know what I love about this place ? " Dixon asks . " I love everything . Sure , the skiers are here , the community is here , but for me , " he sweeps a hand across the landscape , tawny and steep , the green orchards rising toward Mount Hood in the distance , " what I love is the Gorge . More than the sailing . More than the people . " Across a narrow , graveled pathway , doling burritos and burgers from the open window of his panel truck , is Bob Larson , proprietor of the beach 's only concession , The Killer Take-Out Stand . Festooned with zebra stripes and painted splotches and topped by an old sailboard that doubles as a sign , the stand fits the scene so perfectly it seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Larson 's maiden year as a Hood River chef . A ski technician in Jackson Hole , Larson and his wife , Lexey , a veterinarian , own a " surf cabin " in Hood River and a " ski cabin " in Jackson . First he pounded nails for a living here . " Then I decided it was time to trade up , " Larson explains , " to get a steadier summer thing going , so I bought this truck . " It 's an arrangement that has worked better than he could have imagined . When the wind rises , Larson places heavy steel bowls of bananas , raisins , cookies , and candy bars on his stand 's counter , then abandons his work for the water . Alongside the rations , he leaves a box topped by a sign reading SELF SERVICE , HELP YOURSELF , and underneath that , in smaller print , REMEMBER YOUR KARMA , gently reminding patrons they 're expected to pay for what they eat . Cold drinks and hot coffee are available as well , all managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes hours-long " wind-checks . " For Larson , the line between skiing and windsurfing is a muddy one , with his moods and situations dividing the year by themselves . Usually he shows up in Hood River sometime in April . " Like this year , " he says . " It was Easter Sunday in Jackson . I woke up and looked outside and the snow had n't refrozen . It looked . like it was going to rain . So , I said : " That 's it . " I jumped in my truck and was sailing right here that afternoon . " A customer steps up to place an order , and as Larson folds her a fresh vegetarian burrito , he seems happy and at peace , a man whose life is in perfect balance . Slowly , like a winding bola , the wind has been coming up for an hour or so , and now the wind pulls Larson from his truck . He sets out his bowls of food and the cash box , then shuts the truck tight for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he steps outside and makes for the beach  --  where his already-rigged sailboard awaits  --  he smiles and throws his palms toward the sunny sky . " Look at this , " he says , grinning and turning in a 360-degree circle , taking in Swell City . " It does n't suck . " At 7:30 on Thursday morning , the telephone in my hotel room rings . It 's Doug . " We 'll meet you downstairs in 45 minutes , " he says . " We 're going up to Mount Hood , to make some turns . " So at 8:30 on a bright August morning , I find myself standing in front of the Hood River Hotel , a cup of coffee and blueberry muffin in hand , scanning Oak Street for the Coombs ' Toyota van . Finally , it rounds the corner at a stop light  --  listing with centrifugal force  --  and streaks down the pavement toward the hotel . Doug and Emily are inside , the expectation of a ski day etched across their faces . We talk for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their van  --  which is now choked with skiing and boardsailing gear . Then , after a 20-second burst of highway directions , the Coombs are off again , their van winding quickly out of sight through town , headed toward the volcanic cone of Mount Hood . Driving on Highway 35 , the ride from Hood River to Timberline ski area takes an hour , and as the pavement rises in altitude , it passes through apple orchards and tall stands of Douglas fir , finally exiting above tree line at the historic Timberline Lodge . There , at the foot of the Palmer Glacier , I find Doug and Emily already dressed to go . Emily and I ride the chair together . Below , the snowfield lies inside gray , sharp , volcanic rock . The U.S. Junior Ski Team . clacks gates on a nearby run . Doug is stretched out on the chair behind us , getting a little sun , watching the racers and trying to pick out his next line . At the top , he takes off downhill , Emily on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoother somehow . Away from the concerns of teaching and operating heli-trips , they 've been allowed to just go , and the freedom is evident in their every move , just as it is in their boardsailing . On the next ride up , where Emily has gone a few chairs ahead , Coombs talks of the business he conducts on the mountain : the promotional photos , the equipment testing . Then , his eyes lifting to Mount Hood 's ragged peak , he points out a few of his favorite off-piste runs . Thankfully ( for me ) , it 's too late in the summer for us to take such runs now ; the snow is far too thin . Still , as he talks about skiing the steep , volcanic cliff faces , you can tell he ca n't wait to be on the steeps again . " In July we hike up there at night , especially during the full moon , " he says , " then we ski down at first light : It 's beautiful . " When he and Emily are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's when he really sees what brought him to the Gorge . From the mountaintop , the vista takes in the river , and the mountains stitched with lumber roads , and the nearby summer snow , ready for skiing . And still , he says , it is n't any one of these things that 's been bringing him here for more than a decade ; it 's all of them , together . " When I 'm down on the river , " he says , " I always think I live here for the sailing . And whenever I 'm out biking on the trails , I think I 'm here for that . And then at times like now , when I 'm skiing , I know I live here because of the snow . " He pauses a bit , turning his face toward the sky as the chair rocks gently uphill . " I think you 've found a rare place to live , " he finally adds , " if , no matter what you 're up to , you feel completely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place is here . " It 's a sentiment echoed over town . Yet nowhere in Hood River is the town 's communal sense of luck shouted more loudly than the River City Saloon on Thursday nights . There , inside the sail-draped , wood-paneled beer hall  --  usually starting sometime after nine o'clock  --  Moe Dixon begins pulling them in . Soon , they 're four or five deep at the bar , and every table is suddenly without an empty chair . As Dixon takes the stage , the place erupts . For the next two hours , his joyous presence expands to own the room , then Hood River 's streets , and then , it seems , the entire Gorge itself . When he launches into a fast song , everybody 's up : hands and heads and shoulders and beers in the air , dancing  --  with Dixon stopping his lyrics to shout at an offending woman friend , " No dancing on the tables , there , please . " Then , when he drops the tempo for a calypso-inflected ballad on his guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody out there may try to kiss you . " As the show careens on , the line outside the door begins stretching up the block ; people are coming to feel the glow , to dance and have a good time while Dixon bashes his guitar with melodious energy . By 11 o'clock , two songs before the first set ends , everyone is dancing and singing along . They 're shouting and sweating and just letting the summertime wash across them before the ski season begins again .

Tracking the Wind There are two popular ways to find out where the wind 's blowing on a given day . Windsight is a pay-per-use service that provides up-to-date wind speeds via sensors installed at the major sailing sites around the Gorge . The sensors report back to a meteorological center in Hood River . Subscribers buy a Windsight card good for 10 , 25 , or 50 minutes ( last year the cost was $10 , $20 , and $35 , respectively ) and access a voice-mail menu with a PIN number .

A free way to find the wind : Bart 's Best Bet , which airs every half hour from 7:20 to 9:50 A.M. on Q104 ( 104.5 FM ) . Amateur meteorologist Bart Vervloet , a Gorge wind-watcher for nine years , uses a combination of high-tech tools ( downloading data from the National Weather Service ) and low-tech techniques ( sticking his finger out in the wind ) to predict wind patterns and velocities . Bart 's motto : " Never leave wind to find wind . " He cites a common  --  and time-consuming  --  Gorge syndrome called " wind-searching , " where sailors drive around on rumors of better wind , which he likens , with a laugh , to " going from Alta to Snowbird to see if the powder 's different .
