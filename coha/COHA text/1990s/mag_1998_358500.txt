No pyramids loom there ; no mausoleums mark it as a portal through which Egyptian nobles entered the afterlife . Think of it as the Peoria of Pharaonic times , a backwater where ordinary peasants and farmers lived and died  --  and left pretty ordinary remains . <P> Yet the ordinary can sometimes prove remarkable .

The French team has already returned the bodies to their resting places . And given the remote location , it seems unlikely they will ever be removed again . <P>  --  Reported by Andrea Dorfman/New York
