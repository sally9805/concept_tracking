July 1952 There was roast lamb for lunch . Roast lamb with mint sauce , newish potatoes , and carrots . The mint , potatoes , and carrots came from Lady Marjorie 's garden . Molly glanced nervously at her father as Mr. Paget carved two slices of lamb , each heavily streaked with fat , and laid them on Molly 's plate . But her father did not intervene . He had one hand curled comfortably around a glass of claret and was listening to a racing anecdote , one with which even Molly , who had not yet been born at the time of the incident , was familiar . From her father 's smile , Molly could tell that , far from being bored , he was listening to the story with pleasure . Tibby Hassard was enjoying himself . Sunday lunch at the Pagets ' , although the household was not luxurious nor the family famous for its wit , gave pleasure to Molly 's father . Shared memories -- there were photographs of a younger Frank Paget among those in the Hassard albums -- of a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a feeling that had started with the glass of sherry before lunch . The modest lunch party was a small respite from the worries , largely financial , never far from the minds of all the adults present . Molly was eight years old , and although not old enough to be able to describe her father 's attitude in words , she recognized it . Mr. Paget was also enjoying himself , was maybe even happy . His wife ( not called Mrs. Paget but , as Tibby had reminded them in the car , Lady Marjorie , since her father was a duke ) did not share her husband 's light spirits . If Molly 's mother had been at lunch , she would have smiled , too , but she , unlike Tibby , would have prevented their host from serving Molly with a piece of meat that , although a treat for Tibby ( and an extravagance for Lady Marjorie , one of five daughters brought up on a heavily mortgaged Scottish estate ) , Molly was unable to eat . Even if she could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into her mouth , Molly could not have swallowed it . But Morag was not at lunch . She was at home , resting . Morag 's resting was why Molly and her father and her ten-year-old cousin Sophie were visiting the Pagets instead of eating Sunday lunch at home . The lamb -- pink , greasy , and oozing a tinted liquid that ran into the mint sauce -- prevented Molly from eating the vegetables -- the safe part of the meal -- with any enthusiasm . Playing for time , she cut her potatoes into small pieces , lifted them to her mouth , and chewed them until she felt able to swallow . The plate in front of her was part of a Mason 's ironware service . There was a small chip on the side of the plate . The fork in her hand and the spoon and fork above her plate were silver , so old and worn that the tines of the forks were a little shorter than they were meant to be , and not quite even . Since silver is too soft to cut meat , the large knife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stainless , and turned black where it had touched the juices on her plate . She laid down the knife and fork and looked despairingly at her father . Mr. Paget 's anecdote was finished , and he was refilling Tibby 's wineglass . The glass was Waterford , and it was beautiful but not large ; Tibby 's relief was apparent to Molly . " Eat your lunch , child , it 's getting cold . " Lady Marjorie had been partially deaf since childhood , and her voice , in which her Highland origins could still be heard , was loud and somewhat strident . Molly felt her face turn red . She was afraid that she would begin to cry . Her lip began to quiver . " She 's not hungry . " The Pagets ' nineteen-year-old son , Desmond , had not spoken since the beginning of lunch , although Molly had noticed that he , too , had appeared entertained by his father 's steeplechasing story . Molly looked at him with her complete attention for the first time . Before lunch while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Molly and Sophie had been sent to admire a mother cat and her kittens in a basket beside the fire . Since Tibby did not permit animals in the house , the kittens had been of greater interest to Molly than had been the young man in a tweed suit whom she knew to be attending an agricultural college in England . She now realized from the way he spoke to his mother that he was not quite a grown-up but , although he belonged to the younger generation , his voice suggested that his opinions carried weight in the family . " Do n't be silly , Desmond , Molly needs her lunch . I 've never heard of such a thing , " Lady Marjorie said . The rest of the table was silent . Molly glanced at her father , who seemed mildly put out by the interruption of the more entertaining reminiscences . Sophie , from whom Molly hoped for nothing more than sympathy , was looking thoughtfully at the velvet cuff on her dress . She , too , had been silent during lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining table , were not encouraged to speak unless spoken to , Sophie did not usually take that convention to apply to herself . Unless Tibby were present . Her uncle Tibby was the one adult whom Sophie treated with respect . Even by the age of ten she seemed to give his good opinion more value than Molly had ever seen her give anything else . Today , content with the knowledge that she was by far the prettiest and the best-dressed person in the room , she was acting the part of a demure princess . The sudden silence was , however , too much for her . " My mummy says that I --  " she started when , to Molly 's amazement , Desmond pushed his chair back from the table and stood up , smiling . " She does n't feel well ; look how pale she is . I 'll take her to the greenhouse and show her the fleurs du mal . Be sure to save us some gooseberry fool . " With a gesture of his hand , he indicated that Molly should follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Marjorie say : " The child is worried about her mother . " Desmond closed the dining-room door behind them . Molly felt a wave of embarrassment overtaking the relief she felt at leaving the plate of congealing food behind her . " On second thought , I think it might be wise to make sure of the gooseberry fool now . Why leave anything to chance ? " Molly followed silently as Desmond left the large paneled hall and turned right through a swing door into a long , bare corridor . Just inside the door , which was lined on the back with green baize held in place with brass studs , was a large gong . Desmond pointed to the gong stick , a piece of polished wood with a bulbous end covered in worn chamois . It was hanging from a piece of equally worn leather . " Like to have a go ? " Molly shook her head . " Mind if I do , then ? " Molly was fairly certain that Desmond was not really asking her permission to strike the gong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent as Desmond took the gong stick and , holding it in both hands , raised it over his shoulder and slowly swung it toward the gong . As the discolored chamois met the metal , it produced a low , deep , booming sound . Molly hoped that no one would think that she had been responsible for the noise , but at the same time she hoped that Desmond would repeat his invitation . But Desmond , turning right again , led them into the butler 's pantry . Not since a brief period around the time of the First World War , when the Pagets had received a large payment under the Wyndham Act and had dipped into what was intended to be capital , had they employed a butler , but , as in the house in which Molly lived , many of the rooms bore obsolete names , evocative of the days when some of the Anglo-Irish landowners had not only the money and power to live in a feudal manner but the necessary proportion of cold blood to carry it off . From behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room could be heard the low hum of conversation and the clink of glass and silver . Desmond raised a warning finger to his lips , and he and Molly moved carefully to a table on which had been set the gooseberry fool , a large Stilton almost entirely hollowed out , and a salver with a decanter of port . Molly was now quite hungry . While Desmond helped them to the smooth , pale-green pudding , Molly looked into the Stilton . At the bottom of the cheese a small , fat , white maggot crawled slowly over a blue vein . Molly looked away . The decanter contained only a couple of inches of port . Her father had once complained on the way home from a previous visit that he had been given the smallest glass of port that he had ever been offered without humor having been intended . " We 'll eat this in the greenhouse . " Desmond handed Molly her plate and led the way through the hall , not pausing , as Molly would have liked , for a better look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in the past been encouraged to pat its huge head and gaze into its yellow glass eyes . At the far end of the hall , Desmond pulled back a heavy baize curtain and opened a glass-paneled door . A border of stained glass , wine red and a faded green , surrounded the larger opaque central glass panels . Desmond led them into a small , unused conservatory ; ferns and one lichen-covered wall all that remained of what had once been a palm-filled male sanctuary where Desmond 's grandfather had been in the habit of smoking an Egyptian cigarette each day after lunch . The conservatory smelled of mold and damp , and Molly was glad to reach the open air through a peeling white door at the far end . Outside , a eucalyptus and a jungle of bamboo served , more than the pantry named for a long-departed manservant , as tangible reminders of a time when Desmond 's grandfather could afford -- or , rather , not afford but had access to enough money -- to collect exotic trees and shrubs and plant them in the mild , moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Molly into a large , domed greenhouse in the center of which was a lily-filled pond . Molly was happy to sit beside it and take tiny bites of her gooseberry fool . " Look , " Desmond said . A large pink goldfish was nosing the underside of a lily pad on which sat the smallest frog Molly had ever seen . " Sophie 's your cousin ? " Desmond asked . " Yes . She stays with us when her parents are away . Sometimes I stay with her . She 's an only child , too . " " But your mother 's having a baby ? " Molly looked at the dark-red tile at her feet . More than thirty years of mud and grit had coated and scratched it . " Yes . " Molly was old enough to understand that her mother was pregnant , but she had never been told that this was the case . She worried that this meant she was n't supposed to know . The idea embarrassed her , and she put it out of her mind much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with a nurse and there was a reason why she and Sophie had been taken out for the day by Tibby , but she did n't want to think about it . " I suppose they 're hoping for a boy ? " Molly supposed so , too . If she had it to choose , she would have preferred a girl . She and Sophie could dress up the baby in the old lace dresses and embroidered shawls that were kept between sheets of frayed , crumpled tissue paper in a chest of drawers in an unused bedroom . But she knew that each family needed a son to inherit the property and encumbrances and to carry on the name for at least one more generation . " If I ever have children , I want them to be girls , " Desmond said . Molly looked at him in surprise . It was not a view she had ever heard expressed before . " Why ? " Desmond was silent for a moment . Molly had the impression that he knew what he wanted to say but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The wine glasses at lunch . Did you notice them ? " Molly nodded . She remembered them not only because she had been watching her father but because they were similar to some that were kept in a glass-fronted cabinet in the dining room of her own house . " When I was a child there were eleven wine glasses left . There had originally been twenty-four of each kind . Now there are seven , and one has a chip in it . They set that glass in front of my mother because she does n't drink . The glasses ca n't be replaced . They 're original Waterford , not the stuff they make now and sell to Americans . We could n't afford to replace them , anyway . Everything 's like that -- we 're living on leftovers , preserving and patching and making things last . There 's not quite enough to last my parents ' generation , and there really wo n't be enough for you and me , but we 'll probably do it anyway . But after that ... If I have children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics or have jobs . " " Sophie 's going to be a film star . " Desmond laughed , and Molly wished that she had not proffered this information in quite so reverential a tone . " A film star . It 's perfect . The healthy impulse to swim away from a sinking ship , modified perhaps genetically by the Anglo-Irish compulsion toward the impracticable . I admire the long-shot aspect of it , of course . How 's she going to go about it ? " Molly did n't know , and she suspected that Sophie did n't know either , and she wanted to protect herself as much as Sophie , to change the subject . " Where are the flowers you were going to show me ? ' " They 're in the other greenhouse . " Desmond closed the door of the second greenhouse behind him , and Molly noticed that the temperature was a little cooler and that air was moving through openings where panes of glass had been removed and stacked , grimy and a little green around the edges , against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves of soft lead , less than an inch wide and shaped like blunt hooks , into which the glass could be slotted at night or during inclement weather . Her family had briefly employed a Swiss au pair , and Molly , if pressed , knew enough French to understand what " fleurs du mal " meant . But when Desmond had first spoken of the flowers , Molly had been occupied with the food on her plate . Nor did she remember the implications of the phrase now that she saw them -- irises in stained , lichen-covered clay pots ; pansies in flat wooden boxes ; tulips in a freestanding trough . All of them black . The darkness of the flowers did not seem sinister to Molly ; what surprised her was the absence of warm color . In a greenhouse or garden , she expected her senses to be a little more stimulated than they were indoors . " They 're black , " she said . " We 're still working on getting them black . They 're really only a deeply compromised purple . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say how he did it . I thought maybe he soaked the bulbs in black ink . " " That 's not the way it 's done . Do you know who Charles Darwin was ? " " Daddy says that what he said was n't true . It 's in the Bible what really happened . " " Ah . " Desmond smiled . Molly was shocked . It was the first time that one of her father 's opinions had not been enough to clinch an argument . " Let me put it another way . If you wanted to breed a Dalmatian with more spots , you would choose the most spotted male you could find and the most spotted bitch . When they had puppies you would take each puppy and count its spots . " Molly laughed . " You would discard the less-spotted puppies from your breeding program and breed the more-spotted dogs with other highly spotted Dalmatians . You can see that that would work ? " " Yes , " Molly said . She could see where this was leading ; it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do the same thing with a tulip . You breed for darkness -- sometimes you breed in a related species to accelerate the process . These things happen in nature , only there it is more random . " " But there are n't any black flowers in nature . " " I was thinking of people . You import a fairly large number of English people into Ireland . The strongest , richest men and the prettiest women tend to get first choice of who they 'll marry . From the strongest , richest , prettiest pool they look for other desirable characteristics : a good seat on a horse , wit , nerves of steel about unpaid bills , the ability to hold large quantities of alcohol , a way with words , good enough circulation to live in large , cold houses , and the ability to eat awful food . Pretty soon you 've got the Anglo-Irish . They 're not exactly not English , but they 're different . " Molly 's mind was racing . She wondered if her father would like the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who despised excess , might have admired . He would have liked , too , the greenhouse oddly drained of color . Except for a strand of wisteria that had forced its way through a broken pane on the roof , the grayish-green foliage of the black flowers was the only color in the glass building . Molly wondered if the vine had broken the pane to get inside . After lunch on Sundays , unless the rain was heavy ( the occasional shower not considered a deterrent ) , Molly 's father would take her for a walk on Woodstown beach . If Sophie were visiting , she would , a little less enthusiastically , come , too . Walking was a large part of Tibby 's life . He wore old knickerbockers , hand-knitted stockings , and brown laced shoes that had been very expensive twenty years earlier . He walked for reasons he knew about and for reasons he did not understand but never questioned . In winter , if there was still enough light , he might carry a gun in hopes of putting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of his walk , either . Tibby walked over the field , not looking for something , not thinking of buying the land , not to flatten his stomach or to work off a heavy lunch , but because it gave him pleasure . It would be a rare afternoon in which he did not see , or remember , something of interest . One of the most admirable aspects of Tibby 's character was his ability to remember without bitterness or regret . After lunch -- a little later than usual ; Tibby had lingered at the Pagets '  - -  her father took Molly and Sophie for their usual Sunday walk . The heavy jacket and matching trousers that Molly had changed into in Lady Marjorie 's bedroom were recent hand-me-downs from Sophie . Molly felt none of the resentment that children usually feel while wearing clothes that had been chosen and bought for someone else . She attended a school in Waterford , where her fellow pupils -- largely the children of Church of Ireland tradesmen and farmers from the surrounding counties -- admired her clothes and their London department-store labels with the same frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more important areas . The material of the jacket was thick enough for her to feel warm on the deserted beach . A thin mist blew in from the Atlantic . Molly felt nervous and guilty . She was not sure whether there would be repercussions from her behavior at lunch . Tibby seemed preoccupied . She was fairly sure that she was not the object of his thought , but she hoped that Sophie would not introduce the uneaten meal into the conversation . Rush , the aging black Labrador that had waited patiently outside during lunch , ran joyfully on the beach , splashing in the water , making ineffectual attempts to catch a seagull . Sophie bent and picked up a small piece of driftwood and threw it into the water . Rush dashed after it and returned , shaking doggy water on them . He laid the piece of bleached wood at Tibby 's feet . " Good Rush . Who 's a good boy ? " Sophie said in a tone somewhat like that of Belinda , her mother , as she crouched down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that animal , " Tibby said , not unkindly . Sophie leaped to her feet , a little pink , remembering that what was considered charming in her own family was , by Tibby , thought affected and confusing for a dog that was supposed to earn its keep . " Look ! Look ! " Molly shouted , pointing to the far end of the gritty beach where , partly concealed by the gusts of light mist , a small aeroplane was about to land . " Heel , Rush , " Tibby said , leading his small party up onto the low dunes that were held in place by clumps of beach grass . There were small sheltered pockets of clean , warm sand where Molly 's family sometimes ate picnics . They stood and watched in a silence broken only by Rush 's panting as he sat on his haunches , mouth open . Molly watched as the plane , still tiny in the distance , touched the sand , bounced lightly but unevenly once , and came toward them . There was no sound . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun penetrating the sea mist -- came closer , they could finally hear the sound , not loud , of its engine . The colors , too -- yellow wings , silver body , mahogany wing struts -- became brighter as the plane came level with them , then rolled to a halt about seventy yards down the beach past them . Molly waited to see what her father would do . Unlike Molly , who was often unable to voice her simplest needs , Sophie had no difficulty in stating her wishes . " Let 's go and see , " she said . " It 's Mr. Hannon . From Knockboy . " Tibby was walking toward the small plane , from which a man was alighting . Sophie , without hesitation , put herself at his side . Shy , nervous of the unknown , Molly made a pretense of calling Rush . The dog , obedient to a command from Tibby , ignored her , choosing instead -- tail wagging and nose to the ground -- to make his way back to the water . Molly came to the tracks in the sand made by the aeroplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two wider than the others . Following the tracks , Molly walked slowly to where her father was talking to the man who had just climbed from the plane . Sophie was holding Tibby 's hand . " Mr. Hannon is going to take me for a ride . Do you want to come ? There 's room for two , " Sophie called out . Her excitement made Mr. Hannon laugh . " Two very small girls , if one sits on the other 's lap , " he said . Molly looked at her father . " Would you like to , Molly ? " he asked , his smile encouraging , although his tone did not give the question any particular weight . The light craft appeared insubstantial , fragile , but not so small as it had appeared when she had been watching it land . She saw , with some alarm , that the section of plastic that served as a roof to the cockpit was transparent , and it was even more fragile than the rest of the aeroplane . " No , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting his eye . For a moment she thought that Sophie would try to persuade her . Then she realized that Sophie , who was clambering into the passenger seat without a backward glance , had been counting on Molly 's timid nature . She was pleased to sit , like a grown-up , beside Mr. Hannon , without the disadvantage of a small girl on her knee . Molly felt sad . She slipped her hand into her father 's ; he had no way of knowing that for her to do so was a tiny act of courage . Molly and Tibby drew back as Mr. Hannon switched on the engine . The propeller began to turn . The noise of the engine was loud , and there was a smell of fuel . They watched as the plane moved along the sand and then , gradually , lifted off and rose over the small tree-covered headland at the end of the beach . Tiny again , it circled out over the sea and then turned landward behind them . Soon it was out of sight . Tibby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete attention of her father was a rare pleasure for Molly , and she felt as though she should say something to please him , but she was considering the easy way in which Sophie had taken Tibby 's hand . If her mother really was having a baby , might not that baby also want to hold Tibby 's hand ? Molly did not for a moment imagine that Sophie would graciously withdraw her hand , either literally or metaphorically , to allow Molly her place at Tibby 's side . " Mr. Hannon 's father was the agent at Carrig when old Mr. Butler was alive . I went to school with the Butler boys : they were about the same age as Hannon . He went to Newtown . Old Mr. and Mrs. Hannon were very good sorts -- he 'd been in my father 's regiment in the First World War and she was the rector 's daughter from Dungarvan . " Tibby 's conversation was full of biographic and geographic references . Being an agent on a large estate such as Carrig was one of the few acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferred that the Hannons were socially modest . Tibby and the Butler boys had gone to school in England at Repton , which was where Anglo-Irish families of their sort sent their sons . Mr. Hannon , however , had been educated at Newtown , a Quaker school in Waterford . " Hannon used to come home from school sometimes at the weekend and his parents -- well , the Butler boys were away at school , and I think they wanted their son to have friends that he 'd have more in common with -- told him if he wanted to bring a friend home with him that he could . He was a shy boy , and I suppose they thought it would be something pleasant he could offer another boy of his age : real food , only going to church once on Sundays -- you know . So , early on in his second term he said he would like to bring a friend to stay . Old Mr. Hannon went to collect them after school on Saturday , and there was young Hannon with a little girl from two classes below his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Irene . Her father was a solicitor in Cahir . The Hannons were surprised , but they had n't specified a boy and they did n't know what to say . Later , that was ; of course , they welcomed the little girl . Mrs. Hannon quickly made up the spare room -- they 'd assumed that young Hannon would share his room with his guest -- and neither of the children seemed embarrassed by the mistake . The weekend went off well enough , although the little girl hardly spoke a word . Then the same thing happened two weeks later . " " What was she like ? " Molly asked . " I saw her one weekend when I was visiting the Butler boys . She was little and thin . She had ginger hair , and she was wearing a dress I imagine was a hand-me-down . She was almost silent . I was mystified , the Hannons were mystified , but the Butler boys did n't go in for being mystified , and they tried to tease Hannon about the girl . He did n't rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were off at a tennis party -- they were beginning to have places to go that I had n't been asked , and they and I were invited to parties that young Hannon was n't ; we were getting to that age -- I walked over to see Hannon . I took the path past the vegetable garden and along the lake . " Molly nodded . She had a clear although not necessarily accurate image of how the house and grounds looked . She had never been to Carrig , now a hotel , the Butler family long gone . " When I got to the old boathouse -- even in those days it was crumbling ; now I suppose it 's gone -- I heard voices coming from the reeds . They did n't see me . The path was in the shade , and they were in the sun . They were sitting in the old punt in the reeds , young Hannon listening to Irene . I was too far away to make out what she was saying , but he was listening and nodding . She had a little book in her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stopped speaking . They brought the punt in and got out . Irene did n't say a word except hello all the way back to the house . " " What was the book ? " Tibby smiled . " I thought you 'd ask that . She slipped it into her pocket as she stood up . As though it was something private . " " And then what happened ? " " Well , nothing . The family got used to having her around . George Butler nicknamed her ' The Wife , ' and it stuck . " " And what happened when they grew up ? Did they get married ? " " Oh , yes . I never doubted it for a moment after I saw them in the punt , although I still have no idea what she was saying or what the book was -- it could have been Latin verbs or her diary . It was the way he was listening to her . " Molly was silent for a moment , trying to imagine Mrs. Hannon , whom she knew by sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , and she saw the aeroplane was returning . It appeared against the white herring clouds and pale-blue sky as a dense black insect , then it grew to the size of a bird . The sound of the single engine , choppy but not unpleasant , became audible , and Tibby tightened his grip on Molly 's hand and drew her up to the dunes . For the second time that afternoon they stood in silence as the small craft landed on the beach below . Sophie was exultant . " You can see everything ! We saw the cook at Woodstown House picking raspberries and Mr. Mulcahy walking his greyhound and an old woman feeding hens and some little girls skipping rope . You should have come , Molly . " Molly hoped that Mr. Hannon would repeat his invitation . She wanted to see what Sophie had described , to look down into the walled garden at Woodstown House . And she wanted an opportunity to look at Mr. Hannon , now that she felt some curiosity about him . But after a moment her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his watch , and said it was time to go home . Late-afternoon sun reflected on the upstairs windows of Fern Hill as they approached the house . A well-tended lawn , weed-free gravel , and syringa bushes in bloom under the library window suggested peace and order . A frightened , inarticulate maid weeping in the hall was their first intimation that something was wrong . " Go into my study , Maisie to Tibby 's tone , stopped crying , and Molly hurried upstairs followed by Sophie , who had opened her mouth as though to ask a question and had then thought better of it . Molly , scared , although her fear had no name , did not want to be left alone with Sophie and to bear her curiosity and speculation , and when Sophie went directly to the night nursery , Molly continued along the corridor to the nursery bathroom . Next to the nursery bathroom -- the house had been built along simple plumbing lines rather than for comfort -- was the bathroom that served the guest rooms . The door stood ajar , and Molly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion 's claw foot of the bathtub , a pile of stained sheets . Appalled , fascinated , she stopped and looked , trying to understand . There was blood on the sheets , of that she was certain . But pale blood , diluted with some other liquid and darker at the edges of the stains . Understanding that the stained sheets and Maisie 's tears meant that something terrible had happened to her mother , Molly slowly closed the bathroom door .
