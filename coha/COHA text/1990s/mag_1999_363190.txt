In an interview with TIME 's Michael Fathers and Hannah Bloch , Pakistan 's new ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , discussed his vision for Pakistan 's future : <P> TIME : Having ended 14 years of representative government , what do you plan to put in its place ? <P> Musharraf : I would like to move toward the substance of democracy and away from the sham democracy we have had . I want a true democracy at the grass-roots level in which people can govern themselves and run their own health programs and road construction . Members of the National Assembly were doling out uncontrolled funds and controlling people 's destinies at their whims . I 'll change that . <P> TIME : How long will your honeymoon last ? <P> Musharraf : I can not really give any time limits because I do not know how much time it will take . It 's the people of Pakistan on whom I am banking . I 'm pretty sure when we are performing , when we are delivering , when there is better governance , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial harmony , the people will see and the honeymoon will continue . <P> TIME : In New Delhi you are held responsible for last summer 's war with India . How do you hope to normalize relations with India ? <P> Musharraf : I was chief of army staff , so I take full responsibility for whatever my army does . However , Kargil has to be seen in the total perspective of Kashmir , and such far-reaching decisions are not taken by one man alone . Everyone was on board , including the Prime Minister . As far as my attitude toward India is concerned , I 've been very realistic . I surely believe there has to be peace in the region and we have to resolve all our issues with India . But can we do anything without progress on Kashmir ? No , we ca n't . It 's just not realistic .
