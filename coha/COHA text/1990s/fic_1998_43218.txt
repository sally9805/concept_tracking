Backward , turn backward , oh ! time in your flight Make me a child again , just for tonight . - " Rock Me to Sleep , Mother , " popular Civil War song 1 <p> Y MOTHER LEFT ME A bradshaw when she died , along with her house on the Scofield College campus , together with all its contents , and my father 's guaranteed pension with six years left to run . The bradshaw was a surprise , to put it mildly . Anything to do with alien technology was so horrendously expensive for an average citizen , I figured she had to have scrimped for nearly a decade to buy it , starting not too long after I 'd told her the truth about Dad , which was several years after he died in 2023 . Had he still been alive at the time , I knew she would n't have let a word of my story slip past her defenses . As it was , she remained deeply vested in her own version of their marriage , and after that one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bradshaw was my first clue that , over time , she must have begun to acknowledge there could have been something to what I 'd said . It was n't like she did n't already know what Dad had done , or a lot of what he 'd done . But her own father had died when she was little . She 'd always thought that just having a daddy must be the most wonderful thing in the world , and took it on faith that whatever Dad did to me was normal . He was my father , was n't he ? For all she knew , any father might take an obsessive interest in his daughter 's extremely large breasts and talk about them constantly . Or assume a spraddle-legged stance before his daughter and her girlfriend , both young teenagers , to ask if they could tell whether he was wearing briefs or boxers under his trousers . Or describe to this daughter , with terrific zest , the circumstances ( creek valley after school , big flat rock , older boys ) under which he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his obsession with my breasts had been aired even outside the family circle . " I think it 's terrible the way Shelby talks about Pam 's boobs all the time , and I do n't understand why Frances just laughs , " a friend of my parents " told her daughter , who eventually told me . " And remember those tight sweaters your mom used to stuff you into ? " Betsy added , recalling a certain deep-pink lambswool number with short sleeves and a little round collar , and a row of pearl buttons down the swollen front . I remembered , all right . Why had n't I refused to wear those sweaters , chosen for and pressed upon me by Mom , Dad 's former sweater girl ? Considering how violently I loathed my huge breasts , why oh why had the sweaters I went out and bought for myself fit the same way ? After years of therapy I sort of understood the storm of conflicting feelings present in every member of a family like mine , but thinking about it still made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Scofield College , or a full-time standing faculty , since 2028 . But Scofield was popular with conference organizers . Our group from the Bureau of Temporal Physics had chosen the campus for good reason , but throughout the week we 'd spent steaming up and down the river between Scofield Landing and Hurt Hollow in the rain , the managers of Landfill Plastics Inc. had been using the other half of our dorm , and three other dorms were booked up and bustling too . My house - the one my mother left me - was regularly used by the college as conference lodging . During our conference , naturally , I stayed there myself , and I 'd invited my old friend and ex-lover Liam O'Hara to join me there for auld lang syne . Liam and I had trained as BTP Apprentices together ; he 'd visited me in this house when we were kids . After I lost the mathematical intuition that had qualified me for an Apprenticeship , relations between us had become somewhat erratic and conflicted . Inevitably , they 'd worsened after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , probably for the same reason I 'd extended it : nostalgia for a distant time we both preferred , in certain ways , to the present . When the conference was over I went up to Liam 's room , my parents " former bedroom , on the morning we 'd both planned to leave . I found him packing and marveling at the framed pictures crammed on the top of my mother 's big mahogany dresser . " My God , look at us , " he said . " When did she take that one ? " The picture was a holo of Liam and me in the spring of 2014 , when for several weeks we 'd lived at Hurt Hollow with the alien Humphrey , our teacher at the Bureau . The Hollow had been a working homestead then , not the museum it had since become , and the goats , bees , and big organic garden had still been the basis of somebody 's livelihood . The entire set-up was a powerful , attractive model of the sort of lifestyle the Hefn had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homesteader , a friend of mine since my earliest childhood , had been bitten by a copperhead . Liam and I had been helping out while he recovered , and Humphrey 'd dropped in at Liam 's suggestion to check the place out . I had a treasured memory of Humphrey on the terrace at Hurt Hollow one morning , in a chair that tried to make his legs bend the wrong way , pausing in the rapid spooning of blackberries and yogurt into his mouth to ask , " Do you clever children know , either of you , how to cook a " cobbler ' ? " I could see his spoon clutched in a hand like a tongs , two short hairy fingers opposing two others , and the gray hair around his mouth , sticky with honey and stained with berry juice . At that moment Humphrey had been one happy Hefn . But not for long . In the holo , Liam was standing on the same terrace with a brimming pail of goat 's milk in each hand , grinning at the camera ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers without socks , and looked as if he had n't a care in the world ( not true ) . I had started ahead of him down the steep path to the spring house . All you could see of me was a blur of lightcolored clothing and another of straight , brown , shoulder-length hair , but even so I had contrived to look both furtive and embarrassed , an impression emphasized by Liam 's own sunny , open good looks . The picture made me feel somewhere between weird and desolate . " That was that time Mom and Dorothy What's-her-name stopped by the Hollow , right after Humphrey came , I think . Listen , how long does it take to set up a bradshaw ? " Liam looked up sharply from this ambiguous image of our shared past . " A bradshaw ? I never handled one , I du n no - couple of days ? Why ? Oh , " he said before I could answer . " The one your mother left you ! Thinking of shooting it while you 're here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smirked at me across the bed . " Just tell me , how do I arrange to get one set up on short notice ? I need to get back , I probably should n't take more than a couple of extra days out here . " Before he could reply , his pocket phone dinged . I leaned against the wall while he talked to Bureau Headquarters , glancing back and forth between the live Liam and the holo of the Goatherd , considering how that handsome , cheerful-looking kid had been transformed into the balding , restless , dissatisfied , thirty-eight-year-old person in the BTP uniform , hunkered among tumbled sheets on my parents " old four-poster , taking notes on a Landfill Plastics pad . As the conversation wound down he glanced up and caught me at the back-and-forthing . " Hold it a second , Johnny - do you know how to set up a bradshaw on short notice ? " The little squeak of John Wong 's voice came through while Liam looked at me . " Pam Pruitt , " he said , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Kentucky ? " I nodded . " She inherited one from her mom , and she wants to get it shot while she 's out here - she 's here for the conference too . " Johnny 's voice squeaked again . To my ear it had a surprised sound , and I imagined him saying , " Pam 's there ? Why ? " and felt my face get hot . But actually he was asking something else . " As a matter of fact , I do , " said Liam , " Have n't used it , though , the weather 's been terrible till today . " He listened . " Come on , somebody else must be in the neighborhood . Artie and Ray were here till yesterday , are n't they still around ? I 've never done a bradshaw in my life . " " Let me talk to him , " I said . " Pam wants to talk to you . " Liam clicked on the room mike and aimed the phone at me . " Hi , Johnny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned a tiny grin . " I never knew you owned a bradshaw . " " Listen , I do n't want Liam put in charge of this , if that 's what you 've been leading up to . " " You have n't got a lot of choice if you want to shoot it now , " he said . " Artie and Ray are already in Canada on special assignment . And bradshaws are tricky , we usually get a couple months " advance notice . What was this , some kind of spur-of-the-moment decision ? " " Yeah . Scofield is where I 'm from . I do n't get back here very often , and I 've been busy as hell . " " The thing is , Liam 's got a transceiver with him , " Johnny said , a fact that was certainly news to me . I darted a surprised , offended look at Liam , who shrugged . " He 's your only hope . We can spare him for a few more days , that 's all , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't , I should say . If you do n't want him to shoot it , you 'll have to wait and go through the usual procedural web work . " While I hesitated , trying to assess pros and cons , Liam clicked off the mike and clapped the phone to his ear . " Hey , before you start disposing of my weekend , I need to get back , I 've got plans and I 'm beat . Pam can do this bradshaw some other time ... okay . Okay . I 'll let you know . See ya tomorrow . Bye . " He folded the phone and slipped it back into the inside pocket of his uniform jacket . " Do n't look at me like that . There was n't any reason to tell you . " He 'd been hiding the transceiver in my own house . " Listen , for the last time , I do n't like you sneaking around sparing my feelings . The more you do that , the more you rub it in that the rest of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I want to think of myself , so do me a favor , okay ? Cut it out . " " You 're the boss . " Liam reached under the bed and pulled out a transceiver in its case , along with a family of dust bunnies ; the housekeeping staff was getting sloppy . He did n't look at me . I 'd lost my mathematical intuition when my father died . In Liam 's view this was a tragedy ; it embarrassed him to remind me that his gift was still vital when mine was not - that he was a starter and I now only a bench warmer in the world-saving game Humphrey had trained us both to play . My therapist , who 'd once been Liam 's , hypothesized that my intuitive ability had developed so I 'd have a means of escaping an intolerable situation , and that when I had n't needed it anymore it had simply shut down . This " instrumentalist " view of things horrified Liam , to whom the thought of losing intuition , and therefore attunement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyesight , or sexual potency . Since I put a lot of energy into denying that it horrified me as well , and since I was deathly serious about not wanting to think of myself as a Poor Thing , this conference-which I 'd attended under protest , at Humphrey 's insistence - had given me a wretched week . We 'd convened to brainstorm about ways of using the transceivers to address the developing worldwide Baby-Ban crisis : where in civilized time had a human population stabilized its numbers and sustained them ? What were the means , the incentives , the geophysical circumstances ? Where could we look that we had n't looked already ? Because the Hefn insisted that if the model was n't somewhere in our past , it was n't going to be anywhere in our future . All through the discussions , urgent and fascinating though they were , I 'd been acutely conscious every instant of my sidelined situation , and of the overpolite attentiveness of my colleagues whenever I tossed out an idea that somebody else would have to follow up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a lot to have me up and running again - I 'd been very good at my job while I was doing it - but under the circumstances they could n't see , any better than I could , why Humphrey had insisted that I attend . Even the Hefn Alfrey , who was running the show in place of the hibernating Humphrey , obviously had no idea what I was doing there . So Liam 's pity was the last thing I wanted right now . Were it not for my lost gift , of course , I also would n't now be in the position of pleading with Johnny Wong to order some other tech to drop everything , requisition a transceiver , and make his way overland to the Ohio River Valley to do a job I could once have done for myself with one hand tied behind me . I need n't have even considered allowing Liam to make the bradshaw for me , let alone trying to persuade him to , let alone - the ultimate humiliation  --  exploiting his pity to get him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't really sure I even wanted a bradshaw . I opened my mouth to say so , but Liam beat me to the punch . " Okay , I 'll do the shoot , but that 's all . I 'm on that plane tonight whatever , I 'm not crossing the blinking continent by rail . You can keep the recording and have the virtual program written after you get back to Salt Lake . Take it or leave it . That 's my best offer . " 3 WAS ELEVEN when the He &; took control of the world , and fourteen when they delivered me , temporarily , from my family difficulties . Because the Earth was in such terrible ecological shape when the Hefn arrived , their first priority was to reverse the process of destruction , get humans to stop overbreeding and squandering their nonrenewable resources . It was to accomplish this that they gave us the Directive , and punished those who would n't abide the rules by removing their memories . They did n't want to annihilate us , but they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the applied threat of mindwipe , to get us to cooperate . Except , of course , too many of us would n't . When the Hefn realized we were n't going to mend our ruinous ways and stop destroying our planet just because they said so , then they did seriously consider eliminating us . But some among them persuaded the rest to try a different approach . A handful of mathematically gifted kids - me included - were recruited to be Apprentices , to go and live in Washington DC at the newly created Bureau of Temporal Physics . There the Hefn Humphrey trained us to operate the time transceivers that , by opening a window upon our past , might reveal a moment or moments in human history when our relationship to our world had been balanced and sustainable . Then humanity would have a useful model for the right way to live upon the Earth , or so they reasoned . Meanwhile - and this was critical - they imposed a worldwide moratorium on fertility . Even some of the people who approved of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ban . I heard the Hefn called fascists and dictators , and benevolent dictators , of course , is precisely what they were . Humanity would eventually judge the Ban a means that could not justify its end , and act accordingly . But I liked it at the BTP . I liked my teacher , Humphrey , and what I was learning to do , and I liked being fussed over by the media . I settled in and worked hard . Absent my mother 's pressuring and my father 's intrusive scrutiny , I spent the rest of my adolescence as an egghead in tent-like tee shirts and sweatshirts , which , while they did not conceal the difficulty , had the virtue of failing to emphasize it . 4 Beginning about the year 2025 , in the fifteenth year of their presence on Earth , the Hefn had gone into the bradshaw business in a small way by making their time transceivers available to individuals for personal use . Somebody might give a bradshaw as a gift for a really special occasion , or make one for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la bradshaw mostly raved about the results - I 'd seen a viddy documentary to that effect-but not many people had ; apart from movie stars and business tyros , hardly anybody could afford the things . Hefn time transceivers are very expensive to run . We Apprentices used them so commonly that we seldom thought about the fortunes being spent on our training . But the media always emphasized the staggering price tag , whenever yet another glittering personality arrived at the decision to buy a bradshaw . The Hefn did n't offer employee discounts ; Mom could n't have gone behind my back to buy one from Humphrey for cheap . A time transceiver is the rarest object on Earth . The process-and the expense  --  began when one of these priceless artifacts was liberated from its usual function and removed to the site where the event to be revisited had occurred . Then somebody had to set coordinates , a Hefn or a BTP tech , because nobody else knew how . Then they needed someone to record the event ( if at all possible , without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a therapist to guide the client through the experience of running the bradshaw after it was made . A Hefn might also be required , to wipe memories , if anybody back in the past happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . Committed to preventing abuses - the potential for abuse , by child pornographers and sadists and the like , was obvious - the Hefn kept scrupulous track of every completed program . Each had to be filed at a public VR parlor and played only there . You could therefore never be sure , while running your bradshaw , that a Hefn Observer was n't looking in . Transceivers had to open the time window upon the actual site of the event . A person could n't sit comfortably in Boston and look in on one of her father 's alcoholic rages in Topeka ; she had to go to Topeka , to the actual house she 'd lived in at the time , if it was still there , or to whatever building or abandoned freeway or rubble field presently occupied the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself could be cumbersome enough . When King William V made a bradshaw to replay a certain painful scene with his father , he 'd had to sail the royal yacht Britannia to New Zealand , with a time transceiver and assorted technicians on board . The Hefn decided who got to fly in a plane , and a king 's desire to experience a virtual intervention in his own past was no reason , in their view , to authorize a flight . Until the moment my mother 's will was read , the idea of my making a bradshaw had literally never crossed my mind ; and after I owned one or a voucher that could be exchanged for one - I was conflicted about what to do with it . On the one hand , conventional therapy had already helped me confront and deal with my feelings about my father ; on the other , despite the relief I 'd derived from that , I was still pretty much of a mess . Obviously there was more work to do ; but my several attempts to dig deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me sick of the whole struggle . Frankly , had I not felt that the bradshaw represented a final communication from my mother - a sign that she 'd taken my allegations seriously after all - I might very well have sold the thing . Even if I 'd been downright eager to make this bradshaw , I still needed to get back to Scofield , Indiana , to record it , and ordinarily that was n't easy . Scofield College  --  where my father had been Director of Libraries , where I 'd lived the first fourteen years of my life before the Hefn whisked me away to DC and safety - was a long way from Salt Lake City , and my early life equally far from my present posting as Hefn Emissary to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , or so it usually seemed . I seldom went home even while my mother was still alive . We were uneasy with each other , and overland long-distance travel was exhausting and expensive enough without the stress of a filial visit at the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bradshaw if Humphrey had n't decided the brainstorming session about the Baby Ban should be held at Hurt Hollow , and that I had to be there . As it was , not once during that long week - not until the day of my own scheduled departure , when it was almost too late-did my unconscious relent , and let the idea occur to me that , since I was here anyway , what about the bradshaw ? The thought threw me instantly into a state of urgency verging on panic . The bradshaw ! Why had n't I recognized this trip as the golden opportunity it was , and arranged to make the bradshaw while I was here ? I could n't imagine what was wrong with me , to overlook something so obvious . On second thought , yes I could . I 'd overlooked the obvious so I would n't have to decide whether to make the thing . It was in this muddled state that I 'd gone looking for Liam . 5 The house at Hurt Hollow had been my home for several years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesse Kellum , and its transformation into a museum . Liam stood just off the terrace , around the corner of the house - in almost the exact spot where his Goat Boy picture had been taken- and fussed with his instruments ; I sat on the stone step , munching a sandwich , looking around . Being committed to a definite course of action made me feel calm and clear-minded , ready for whatever might be coming . Liam and I had visited here together as teens at exactly this time of year , mid-April . The trees were a lot bigger now but their leaves were the same bright varieties of green as before , and were as full of noisy birds birds whose songs were intelligible to me , unlike those of the western species I 'd not yet gotten to know very well . Beyond the fence , the paleblue river spread out forever , as it had through all the springs of my life , though the beach where Liam and I - and Humphrey - had gone swimming in 2014 had been scoured away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told him humbly . " The weather was so lousy all week , I did n't really get a chance to take all this in , and we were too busy anyway . " Liam looked up distractedly . " I 'm too busy now . Do n't talk to me for ten more minutes . " " Sorry . " He was rushing , bound and determined to make that plane . He 'd pressured me to pick an event that had occurred back at the house in Scofield , or someplace on the campus , or our canoe launching from Scofield Beach twenty-three Aprils ago - he 'd actually witnessed that ghastliness himself - but I 'd held out for the Hollow at the cost in time of a five-mile taxi ride and a ferry crossing , and he 'd grumpily given in . I finished my sandwich and got up . " I guess I 'll walk down to the dock . Yell when you 're ready . " All sixty-one acres of wooded river bluff had been fenced in long ago , while Jesse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the place was still closed to visitors ; we had it to ourselves . Descending the steep path from the terrace to the gate , I thought again how different this country was from the mountains and deserts of Utah , and how the Hollow was still and always the one place on Earth that I belonged to , heart and soul , mind and strength-the one place that was absolutely mine , though the deed was registered now in the name of the Hurt Hollow Trust , and I never came back anymore . I would n't have used such language to a living soul , Liam least of all , but this - cluster of buildings , wooded hillside , stretch of river - was my heart 's home . Unfortunately , Liam knew this anyway , without being told . In my opinion we knew far too much about each other for the good of either . I unlocked the gate and cut down toward the dock . The past winter 's currents and storm waves had undermined the bank to the point where the trustees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept back from the edge . The dinged-up metal buckled and boomed as I walked out to the end of the dock , shrugging off the thought of sunblock , and sat down to watch the river roll massively by while I got myself as centered as I could . It was n't recommended that a bradshaw be undertaken in a rush . The candidate was supposed to ready herself with counseling and meditation before embarking upon her personal time-travel adventure . Of course , I would n't be running the virtual program for a while yet . But I was going to watch through the window while Liam made the recording , and knew that whatever I saw was bound to jolt me and that I should prepare myself as best I could . Liam had n't even tried to talk me out of watching . He knew it would be a waste of time , and he did n't have time to waste . It was my lookout anyway . " Ready ! " he called finally ; and when I 'd mounted again to the terrace and joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The transceiver had been erected on its tripod , a confection of molded black metal and meshwork spread like a cobra 's hood . For all my brave talk it hurt me to see it there , see Liam 's casual confidence as he moved around it adjusting things , unthinkingly at home in a country where I 'd once lived and been happy and could never return to . I looked away . " April 2013 - I do n't know the exact date , you 'll have to scroll . Start in the middle of the month and work forward , scanning for Dad and me coming out the front door . We were looking up into those trees over there , up the hill . The time window 'll open behind us , I do n't think we 'll notice a thing . " " Roger . " Liam slipped his hands into indentations on the sides of the cobra 's hood , and almost at once the area directly in front of it began to shimmer and then swirl , forming a pattern in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the house , ready to flatten myself against the wall to be out of the way when the window opened . I had n't seen a temporal field in formation for years , but I could still read patterns , and followed as the field shaped itself around the early twenty-first century , then 2013 , then spring , then April . Liam was concentrating , leaning into the transceiver 's field with his eyes closed , deepening his trance . When the pattern entered his mind and became visual , he would free his hands to finger the little abacus-like device the Hefn used to calculate coordinates . Then he would set the coordinates mentally , by hurling each number into the pattern precisely where it needed to go . There had never been a feeling quite like that absolute mastery , being so in tune with the shimmer pattern that the numbers snapped into their places without conscious effort , the way a lacrosse player snatches the ball from the air and hurls it into the net . I would never feel that mastery again . Desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked back , Liam had opened his eyes and stepped away from the transceiver . The window had opened ; the silent recorder was running . Anyone on the other side , where it was 2013 , would have needed a sharp eye to spot the open window . It was April afternoon on both sides , and fine weather on both , and Liam and I were watching from positions where we could look through without being seen from the other side , if my father or my younger self did happen to glance our way . Voices murmured inside the house , a pot banged on a stove top . Presently I heard what I 'd been waiting for : a loud and piercingly sweet ripple of birdsong from a tree on the hillside behind the house . I got a grip on myself in time not to move or react when the screen door swung open with a squeak , and a girl came down the steps followed by a man : Young Pam at almost-thirteen , and Dad at thirty-six . The bird 's song had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I 'd been expecting them , stopped my heart . I could feel Liam 's head turn to look at me . I 'd been just a little older than the girl in the window when he and I had met in Washington to begin our studies with Humphrey . Her father passed the field glasses to Young Pam , who raised them to her eyes and scanned the treetops . Almost at once she smiled ; she 'd spotted the singer , a rose-breasted grosbeak , high in a tossing beech tree full of flowers . " Is the female this pretty ? " she asked , and at the word pretty a stab of pity and loathing pierced me . That poor , homely kid with her potent binoculars ! Her nose was much too big for her face , and her hair hung limp and mousy to her shoulders , but the thing that struck you was the huge mass of her breasts , like a single enormous tumor thrusting forward beneath her red-and-blue flannel shirt with the rolled-up sleeves . How I 'd loved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it blurred my proportions ! It had n't of course ; I could see now with terrible clarity how the breast mass strained at the buttons and the fabric between them . Really , the most that could be said for the shirt was , it was n't a tight pink lambswool sweater . " No , " said Pam 's father , answering her question . In the round frame of the window he stood there younger by a year or so - astonishing thought - than I was now myself . " The female 's duller , like most of the other female finches . Looks kind of like a great big song sparrow , but a duller brown . " Young Pam held the glasses tight on the vivid bird . From my hiding place he was out of my line of sight , but I remembered perfectly how actively the grosbeak had moved through the foliage , eating flowers and pausing ever so often to proclaim his territory . He was so pretty ! Black above and white below , with a triangular bib the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bill . The rippling song poured forth again . Pam 's father suddenly chuckled . " You know something , " he said , " you and that bird up there are a whole lot alike - he 's got a big strong beak , and he 's got a pretty pink breast ! " He laughed again , an innocent-sounding laugh , not cruel at all . " Never thought of that , did you ! I expect he likes both of his better'n you like either of yours , too . " Again I felt Liam swivel his head toward me , and this time I glanced back . His face had filled with indignation ; he understood , now , why I 'd insisted on choosing this incident . Young Pam seemed to falter - and precisely in that instant , the split second between the faltering and the hesitant lowering of the binoculars , a strange thing happened . Before my eyes , suspended in midair , flashed the image of a small book bound in red , with gilded page-edges , gold lettering on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it came a whiff of feeling , gone almost too quickly to register . The image had vanished also . Pam lowered the glasses halfway and stood stock-still . Then , without a word , without glancing at her father , she handed him the binoculars and went quickly up the stairs into the house . Shelby Pruitt stood looking after her , holding the field glasses awkwardly . Unbalanced as I 'd been by what I 'd just seen and felt , it still astonished me - I had n't , of course , witnessed this part of the scene - to see that my young father 's boyish , handsome face now wore a baffled , even a desolate look , a look that plainly said I did it again , but I do n't know what it was I did . Presently he stirred , lifted the field glasses again to scan the treetops ; and I signaled Liam to close the window . This he accomplished quickly and neatly . The lens that formed the window spiraled out from the edge , went opaque , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridge out , and flipped it to me ; I fumbled it , squatted to retrieve it - and could n't stand up again . " Bastard , " he spat , truly furious . " That stupid bastard . That son of a bitch . I 'm sorry I never blacked his eye for him when I had the chance . " He scrubbed his hands through his hair , watching me . In a minute , when I had n't responded or risen , he said , " So - did you get what all you needed ? " And then , sharply , " Are you okay ? " As Liam said this , I sat down abruptly on the paving stones of the terrace , clutching my temples ; a headache had come on like a crack of lightning , making my stomach heave . He came and hunkered down beside me , saying again , " Are you okay ? " I shook my head , truthfully ; I felt ghastly . " No wonder . I 'm pretty thrashed myself . God , this bradshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I think what we just saw actually hit me harder than that realtime thing in the canoe , when he was going on about your swimsuit being too small - " He stood and reached for my hand as he spoke , to help me up . He should have known better ; he did know better . I batted him away and got up on my own , putting our eyes on the same level . " Right after he said that about me being like the grosbeak , did you see a little red book in the air ? " " See what ? " " A red book . In the air , " I repeated , already sure of the answer . " In the air ? No . What are you talking about ? You mean - you did ? " Somebody jabbed an ice pick in my right temple and wiggled it around . " Liam - " I grabbed his arm so desperately that I dragged him off balance , forcing him to take a step toward me " - I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He looked at me like I 'd lost my mind . " What was n't what ? " " I made a mistake . This was n't the right time . " " Right time for what ? The bradshaw ? " And when I nodded , " What are you talking about , it was a classic ! " Then , realizing where I had to be leading , he started to get mad . " Hey , you do n't get a second shot at a bradshaw , just because you rush into it without thinking about it carefully enough beforehand . " He 'd yanked his arm free . " I would have made exactly the same mistake no matter how long I 'd thought about it beforehand . I did n't know this was n't the right time till I saw this time . " " That 's not the Bureau 's fault , Pam ! You had one bradshaw coming , you were hell-bent on making it today , and you worked on me till I caved in and played along . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're gon na have to settle for this one . " He turned away and started to collapse the transceiver . " I know all that , " I said , trying to sound reasonable though I felt like hurling myself on the ground and screaming , " but this one wo n't get me where I need to go . " " Which is where ? " " I do n't know . But now I know how to find out . " Exasperated , he turned to glower at me . " Something to do with the little red book in the air , I suppose ? " " It was a diary , " I said , and heard my voice wobble . " A kid 's diary , that old-fashioned type you were meant to keep in longhand . My diary . From when I was in the sixth grade . I threw it away . " Liam glanced at me again without replying ; I moved to stand beside him . " I 've regretted it a million times , but I always thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the reason was ? " he prompted obligingly , without breaking the rhythm of his work . " I was reading this book , about a Navajo girl . She and her family lived in a hogan , where space was tight , I guess , and her mother was talking about her one day , and she said something like " That one ! She has more possessions ! " and I thought , " I have too many possessions , " and started poking around my room to see what I could throw away . " " You were one weird kid . " " I do n't remember whether I got rid of anything else , but I grabbed this diary that I 'd gotten for Christmas and been writing in all year , and decided to pitch it . And then I was n't sure . I remember saying to Mom that I was going to throw my diary away , and she said , Do n't you think you might want to have it later on ? " and I said , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates . " " Liam emitted a guffaw , but kept working . " She could have stopped me , " I said sadly , remembering that day . " If she 'd said , " Oh , do n't do that , you 'll be really glad to have that diary someday , " I would have kept it . At least , I 'd 've kept it that time ... probably I 'd 've tossed it later on anyhow , though , because I think - I just realized this - I think throwing it away because of that Navajo-girl book is a cover story . " There was a brief silence while Liam finished compacting the transceiver into its case . He looked at his watch . Then he walked across the terrace and decorously sat down on one of the low chairs Orrin Hubbell , the original Hurt Hollow homesteader , had built so long ago . " Okay . Enlighten me . Why do you think you threw it away ? " This was the question it had only just occurred to me to ask myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I went along . " Maybe there was something in it that I needed to get rid of ... something somebody did n't want me to tell anyone about . Maybe the person threatened me - I 'd get sick and die if I told , or whatever . And I do n't think it was Dad , " I said , feeling sure of this at least . " He did what he did , and it was horrible , but I think - I 'm just now starting to think - that somebody else might 've gotten to me first . " " In that same way , you mean ? " " I do n't know . It could have been some other way , I guess . Maybe I saw something I was n't meant to see . " As I spoke the words I knew they were untrue ; I knew it was n't the residue of any " other way , " different from Dad 's , that lay festering inside of me . Whatever the secret was , it was sexual and concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But even if that 's true , I still ca n't see why you 'd hallucinate the diary in the air right then . And I also do n't see what 's wrong with the Navajo-girl explanation . Why could n't you have just taken a notion to throw your diary in the trash ? People do throw stuff away , you know . Why does it have to be some heavy repressedmemory thing ? " But , in my mind , a conviction was strengthening moment by moment . " No , think about it . I 'd pasted some stuff in the diary-a straw from an ice-cream soda bought for me by a boy I liked , named Rick , a locket a different kid named Rick gave me , that had his name engraved on it . You know , souvenirs . Well , before I threw it away I carefully peeled the straw and the locket off the pages , to keep . Why would I do that - keep the trinkets and toss the diary ? It does n't make sense ! I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary , such as it was , I kept a piece of paper with the signatures of all the kids in my fourth-grade class on it , I 've got diaries and journals from the age of fourteen up to and including right now ! Julie says mine is the most thoroughly documented life she 's ever dealt with in her entire career as a therapist ! " " Okay , okay , calm down . " Liam made pushing-down motions with his hands . " What became of all that souvenir stuff  --  where is it now ? " " I 've still got it ! All of it ! " He repeated the gesture , more broadly this time . I sighed heavily and said " Okay . I 'm calm . " " Good . Now . When you claim you 've still got these mementos , do you mean you could go straight to where they are and put your hand on them ? " " Absolutely . That stuff is all in Salt Lake . The straw and locket are pasted in a scrapbook labeled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . " " Hmm . What about the fifth-grade diary ? " " In a bookcase with all my other diaries and journals , above my desk . At the far left of the row . They 're all in chronological order . " " I 'm sure they are . " He made a sour face , then fired one last test question : " What color is it ? " " The fifth-grade diary ? Brown , dark brown . Smaller and skinnier than the others . Flexible cover . " " Pam , " said Liam , " Humphrey might okay shooting a second bradshaw , since the virtual program for this one has n't been written yet - for you he might - but I 'm getting on that plane . " " Humphrey 's hibernating , we 'd have to ask Alfrey , " I said , but things had stopped . We stared at each other . I was now supposed to back down , though both of us knew that , in Liam 's place , I would already have groaningly accepted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time I was n't having it ; the stakes were just too high . " I ca n't stop you , " I said , now very calm indeed , " and I would n't exactly blame you , I know you 've already disrupted your plans as a favor to me . But . If you 'll do this for me too ... well . Let 's just say I 'll never forget it . " Liam 's expression gradually altered . Moving slowly , he got up from the chair , so our eyes were again on the same level across the terrace . " Meaning that if I do n't do it , you 'll never forget that , either . " In my hypervigilant state , his pupils seemed to shrink into sharp , hard pinholes . " And the next time I call you up at midnight or the crack of dawn , to vent about my problems , you might not answer the phone . " " I 'd say that 's probably a pretty shrewd guess . " " So it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't reply . Both of us understood that nothing less than the fundamental balance - or working imbalance - of our relationship was on the line . If Liam went home to Eddie and his heavy weekend , and left me in this particular lurch , I realized that not only would I never forget it , I would n't be able to forgive him . And he had to decide now whether he wanted to deal with that , because we both knew that at this point in our long , difficult friendship , I had less to lose than he did . 6 PERSON MAKES A BRADSHAW in order to revisit a traumatic event in her past as her adult self , equipped with the knowledge and experience she 'd lacked as a child . The transceivers are windows , not doorways ; you ca n't go through , and the Hefn would n't allow it if you could . When something goes wrong , and people in the past become aware of the time window , the Hefn wipe their memories ; they do n't particularly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception ( almost ) if the need arises . They do n't worry at all about changing the future , certain as they are that " Time is One , and fixed " - a maxim of our training as BTP techs . That is : if it 's going to happen , it already has happened , from the foundation of the universe . Because Time is One , there are no alternate realities . Anyway , with or without the participants being aware of the window , with or without mindwipe as a regrettable coda to the use of the transceiver , the recording is made . Besides the visual dimension of the event , shadow memories are also captured and recorded . The transceivers ca n't manipulate memory as well as specialized Hefn memory-control equipment does , but they can get something ; how much varies with the individual and the context , and probably some other factors that are n't yet understood . After that , the VR people use the recording to create a program in which the adult can stride in virtually upon the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervene . He can beat his drunken , raving father to a pulp . He can slap his mother six ways from Sunday . He can pick up the little boy he was , age six and a half , sobbing and bleeding from the rectum , hold him in his arms and tell him , I know , I know all about how awful you feel , how scared you are , how much it hurts , and I 'm never going to let that bastard touch you again . It 's all over now . You do n't ever , ever have to be scared of him anymore . I 'll keep you safe . From now on I 'll be taking care of you . " The point is that while you ca n't make the promise good to the actual six-and-a-half-year-old sufferer back in the past , you can make it good to the six-and-a-half-year-old who still lives inside of the adult you , who 's still traumatized by the awful things done to him and still feels powerless to protect himself . A person need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to find a bradshaw beneficial . People tell themselves that , compared to some of what they 've heard about , the stuff their grandfather/ neighbor/brother did to them is no big deal ; but lesser abuse can also damage its victims much more profoundly than seems reasonable , as I have cause to know . The fellow who gave his name to these virtual interventions was a late-twentieth-century self-help guru called John Bradshaw . All too often this character , a Texan , came through to casual viewers of his very popular media series as a cross between a sleazebag televangelist and a snake-oil salesman . A lot of educated people dismissed him in his day , without troubling to figure out what he was using this off-putting style to explain . This was too bad . No original thinker himself , Bradshaw had an uncommon gift : he could synthesize the ideas of major psychological theorists , without distorting them , and communicate the practical side of these ideas to the sort of people who might never , otherwise , have access to psychotherapy . On TV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences do an exercise . They were to choose a painful scene from their childhoods , one in which they had felt particularly helpless , miserable , betrayed , and Bradshaw 's special buzzword-shamed . They were to close their eyes and picture this scene vividly . Then they were to imagine walking in upon the scene as their adult selves , and doing whatever was necessary to protect the helpless child they used to be . It was n't unusual for workshop participants to burst into violent weeping as they followed their leader 's instructions ; and these interventions were " merely " imaginary . The effect of using the Hefn transceivers to capture actual events , making virtual interventions possible , was phenomenal . Without professional guidance ( and even with it the experience could be overwhelming . A more affordable bradshaw could certainly have become addictive to people who got off on that kind of emotional kick . The actual event captured when the bradshaw was made sometimes proved to be very different from the way the event had been remembered . But nailing the exact cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would never again be alone , defenseless and terrified , in the face of torment . 7 On the morning following the scene with Liam , I woke when a voice spoke inside my head . " Pinny 's Hefn , " said the voice . I was used to waking up with the impression that someone had just spoken aloud , typically a name or an innocuous word or phrase " Carrots , " " That 's the target ! " So in itself this was nothing remarkable . This voice sounded no different ; the difference was in what it said . In retrospect it struck me as a kind of aural equivalent of the diary-in-the-air hallucination . Pinny 's Hefn was the title of a " novel " I 'd written the summer I turned fourteen . The novel dealt with the doings of a peculiar girl Pinny , short for large-nosed Pinocchio - who much resembled me , and a Hefn named Comfrey ; I 'd been extremely taken with the only Hefn I 'd met in the flesh - my mentor-to-be , Humphrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I could . My novel was set , and mostly written , at Hurt Hollow . I had n't paged through the manuscript in years , though ( naturally ) I knew exactly where it was : in a blue folder , in a cardboard box in a Salt Lake City storage closet , among the Memorabilia ( or possibly the Juvenilia ) : 164 pages scribbled in longhand on blue-lined paper with three holes punched down the side . What I thought about after the voice startled me awake , while my mind was clearing , was the looseleaf binder I 'd kept those pages in while I was writing and accumulating them . I could visualize it perfectly , that binder : a ratty old thing even then , made of fake brown alligator skin , with a zipper around three sides . I 'd liked that zipper ; it made the story feel secure . The binder had been Dad 's ; he 'd passed it on to me when I started working on Pinny 's Hefn , at the beginning of my last whole summer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , maybe a year before that , because I 'd already possessed it when I needed a folder to put certain secret papers into for safekeeping . What secret papers ? I could barely remember ; and yet like the image of the red diary - the thought of them carried a powerful emotional charge . Concentrate now , I told myself : what papers ? Some news clippings about horses and horse races - I 'd gone through a racehorse stage , during which I 'd cut things out of the paper . There was one particular Kentucky Derby when I knew who all the horses and jockeys were and who was favored to win by how much . That had been the fifth grade . I was ten . What in the world could have seemed so secret about race horses and horse races ? I 'd always supposed , when I remembered this at all , that I must have made a secret of it just to have a secret ; but it struck me now as peculiar . What else ? I lay perfectly still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some sheets of computer paper on which a code had been worked out by me and a couple of guys named Charlie and Steve , my best friends since earliest childhood , no offense to the two Ricks . We 'd made up this code , with a symbol for each letter of the alphabet , so we could write encrypted notes to each other in school and leave them under the pedal of the drinking fountain out in the hallway . We did that in Mr. Hopper 's class ... so that had been the sixth grade , when we were eleven . Lying there in bed , it drifted back to me . I 'd kept those clippings and the code key in the alligator-skin notebook , tucked into the pockets inside the flaps . When I 'd needed the notebook for Pinny 's Hefn I 'd transferred the other papers to a big manila envelope , and kept the envelope in my bottom bureau drawer , under the T-shirts . Then at the end of that summer , before leaving for Washington to start my apprenticeship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed novel in the blue folder and the clippings and code keys back in the notebook , and put both into a larger box that I stashed up in the attic in my parents " house in Scofield - this house . My room was to be the guest room while I was away ; I did n't want people poking through my stuff . I recall debating whether to keep the notebook at all ; the prospect of the new life before me had made me feel like making a clean break with the past , or certain parts of it . But I did keep it , at some level perhaps remembering the red diary and beginning to understand the mothhole its loss had gnawed in the fabric of my life . Later , when Liam and I had graduated from the BTP and were preparing to move out to Bureau Headquarters , relocating that year in Santa Barbara , I made a farewell trip home . On that visit I boxed up all my books and belongings , acting on a vague wish to get them out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the course of this packing I crawled up a ladder through the trap door that was our access to the attic . Sitting up there cross-legged under a naked light bulb , I went through all my stored cartons and divided everything into two piles : take and chuck . I remembered lifting out the alligator binder and holding it in my hands . I remembered dragging the zipper pull around the edge , with a sound like heavy cloth ripping , and leafing through the yellowed paper scraps within . Several times over the years I 'd winnowed down my stash of " possessions " in the attic . Each time I 'd considered throwing out the papers in that notebook , but had always held back . This time I did it . The odd thing was that I knew , as I sat there in the dust making the decision , that someday I 'd be sorry . This precedent suggested that even if my mother had persuaded me to save the red diary when I appealed to her , another day it would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Hill was it about that year , my sixth-grade year , that I could n't afford to remember or keep any evidence of ? The Hefn had returned that October ; but that was n't it ; I 'd felt only intense interest , untinged with fear , when I heard they 'd come back to stay . I 'd loved my teacher , my school , playing Tarzan on the wooded bluff above the river with Steve and Charlie ; had anyone asked , I would readily have said that that year , my last of real childhood , was the happiest of all . Eleven years old . No period , not quite yet . No boobs yet to speak of , though I 'd received my first training bras already , two of them in soft cotton , a gift from Grandma for my birthday just before the start of the new school year . Obviously , Mom had been discussing my " development " with her mother-in-law . Not with me , though ; the first I knew that there were going to be bras in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both my parents looking on , and there they were . Could it be that I 'd resented Grandma for forcing those bras upon me , and with them the issue of the terrible changes about to possess my body ? So much so that afterward I never wanted to go over to her house when we went down to Louisville ? No , because I could remember sitting in a rocking chair in Granny 's front room one evening , engrossed in a Tarzan book , and Mom touching my shoulder and saying , " Time to go to Grandma 's now . You 're sleeping over there tonight , better get your pajamas and some clean underwear . " I remembered clearly how , at these words , my heart sank like a stone ; and I could n't have been more than eight or nine at the time - much younger than eleven . Old enough , however , to understand that I was n't to object or whine or say I did n't want to sleep over , did n't want to go over there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt about things , unless the feelings were the sort Mom wanted to know about , and I did n't have to be told she did n't want to know about these . Or hear about them , rather , because she did know . She just did n't care . She cared about what I did , not how I felt about it . Feeling agitated , I rolled out of bed , pulled on my robe , and padded down the hall . Liam 's door was open , his bed stripped , his neatly repacked suitcase open on the mattress pad . The time transceiver , in its case , stood on the floor by the door . I trotted down the stairs and found my reluctant guest drinking hot cider at the kitchen table . He was dressed for overland travel , not in uniform but in a loose light tunic and trousers , and his scalp gleamed through his neatly combed hair . " Hi , " I said . " Are you speaking to me today ? " " No , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , and a train tonight that will get me to California Wednesday afternoon . I put my sheets in the washer , which is n't working very well , by the way , you 'd better have it serviced . I 've ordered a taxi for onethirty . Eat something and let 's get it over with . " His last hope for getting off the hook I 'd hung him on had been dashed yesterday when his request for permission to re-record my bradshaw had been instantly approved by the Hefn Alfrey , already back in California and still acting for the sleeping Humphrey . After that he 'd had to choose for himself . I glanced up at the clock : 8:35 . " I can eat later . I 'm ready now if you are . " " Fine . " He scraped back his chair and pushed past me , taking the stairs two at a time . I trailed him , thinking . Diary or alligator binder ? If I could n't have both , which was more important ? Liam grabbed the transceiver as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without looking back , " Where do I set up ? " Both were important , but the diary mattered more . " In the doorway of my room , I guess . " He snapped around . " Do n't guess , all right ? Decide and- tell me where . " " Oh , knock it off , " I said mildly . " The doorway of my room , then , definitely . " He was very angry , but I did n't mind so much about that ; what mattered was , he was here , and that meant the two of us were fundamentally okay , or would be again in time . So , walking stiffly to be sure I understood how mad he was , Liam carried the transceiver down the hall and set it up in my doorway . From that position the lens could take in the whole small room . Though furnished sparsely enough now , it seemed crammed by contrast with the time we were about to revisit . My parents had n't figured that a child 's room needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a bed and a bureau , and nothing else : no desk , no chair , and - astonishing in a librarian 's household - no bookshelves . Mom could never see the point of kids owning books . Once you 'd read a book , why keep it around , when you could check books out of the library for free , then exchange those for others ? If I 'd appealed to Dad , he would probably - no , certainly - have intervened , but I do n't think it ever occurred to me to ask for his help . My few books had been arranged neatly on the floor , along the baseboard of one wall , an arrangement I 'd accepted without question ; the first bookcase I ever had the use of was the one in my room at the BTP , in Washington . There was a ceiling light and a bedlight , but no lamp . I used to do my homework on the dining-room table . I could n't remember where I 'd kept the diary - in the row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe under my bed ? - but I did remember sitting on the bed to write in it . When the window opened , we would at the very least see that . To hide the transceiver was going to be impossible ; unless she happened to be very engrossed in her writing , the eleven-year-old kid I used to be would have to be mindwiped , as Liam pointed out while setting up . The possibility did n't worry me at all . Time is One . ( Lost gift or no , I probably believed this Hefn doctrine more deeply than Liam did . If I 'd been wiped in 2010 or 2011 , that experience had been part of my life ever since . If I had n't , then it had n't been . Either way , nothing would change . " Ready , " he said finally . " Dates . " " Summer 2011 . " The sixth grade would be over and the diary account of it completed . He was to scroll for prepubescent Pam sitting on her bed , reading or writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands into the dimples , and began . Our first problem was an embarrassment of riches . Prepubescent Pam read in bed every night of her life ; that was the point of the bedlight hooked over the headboard . A bewildering jumble of girl , bed , and book , not images but ghostly implications , replaced one another in the shimmer pattern . I could n't look ; the visual mayhem hurt not just the eyes but the brain of an observer not attuned to the transceiver . Even Liam , in perfect attunement , moaned a little with the mental effort of searching a haystack for one particular type of golden stalk . So I sensed rather than saw him arch back out of the field . I looked , and the lens had dilated . A skinny , scabby , sun-tanned girl perched on the edge of the bed , on the side near the window so her back was mostly toward the door , writing in a red book with a pencil . She was dressed in yellow shorts and a plaid halter . Her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her long bare leg , bent double , stuck out over the foot of the bed like the hind leg of a grasshopper . Limp brown hair fell forward , screening her face . It was afternoon of a bright , breezy , hotlooking day ; sunlight streamed in through the open window and the curtains were blowing . The bed was made up with my favorite of several old quilts made by Granny and her spinster sisters , a pattern of silhouetted Dutch girls in bonnets and wooden shoes . I looked upon this scene and felt - heartache . Intense longing . Nostalgia that without much pressure could approach hysteria : joy impossible ever to know again , shimmering just beyond the lens in the sunny room . And something else , a sinister potential , inescapable and dire but for the moment far away . At the sight of myself - of everything I 'd been just then , just there , extreme two ways at once - my ears rang and the edges of my field of vision went black . But Liam , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the door jamb and lowered my head till the ringing stopped and my vision cleared . When I looked again , the girl had closed the red book and turned sideways on the bed . Her face and body in profile fleshy nose that nobody 'd yet realized had once been broken and had n't healed correctly , little tethered breasts pointing beneath the halter made my throat ache . She clicked the diary 's strap into its lock and held the book in both her hands , a moment of utter privacy , before reaching under the bed to pull out a scuffed navy-and-white saddle oxford , a school shoe . She shook something out - a key chain , that fell into her hand with a little clink . And I knew , abruptly , what was on that key chain : a four-leaf clover embedded in plastic , and a tiny gold key . The girl pushed the key into the keyhole with two long fingers and turned it , locking the diary . She dropped the key chain into the toe of the shoe and stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up - and I signaled Liam to pull us out . I did n't need to see her hiding place , not at the cost of having to wipe her . I had what I needed . 8 MONTH LATER found me sitting , hunched forward , in a private cubicle of a VR parlor in Salt Lake City , my bradshaw 's virtual program disc in my lap . My therapy session by videophone was almost over . My therapist , Julie Hightower , was seated in a big upholstered chair in her Washington DC office-actually a room in her own house in Georgetown - looking as calm and composed as I felt anything but . We 'd had four weeks now to prep for this , but my shock at seeing the child I used to be , in that room full of extreme and contradictory feelings , had n't entirely faded , and we 'd spent this session talking about the pros and cons of proceeding vs. further preparation . " I do think , if you want to run the program now , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I think you should be careful , and be ready to jump out and regroup if you start to feel the waters closing over your head . Remember , you can always have another go tomorrow , or next month , or whenever . " One of the things I liked most about Julie was the judicious , respectful way she talked to her patients . To me , anyway . She was Liam 's therapist too-he 'd referred me to her-but we 'd stopped exchanging notes about Julie years ago ; I had no idea how , or even whether , she talked to him these days . I grinned weakly and said , " I 'll remember . " I 'd asked if she wanted to monitor , but Julie felt the value of the experience  --  especially this first time - might be compromised if my concentration on it were less than total . On the other hand , given the circumstances , extra contact time was okay by Julie . " Call me if you need to , " she urged . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . We confirmed the next week 's appointment , said our goodbyes , and hung up . For fear of charging away without it later , I took the time to disassemble and stow the phone in my backpack . Then , before I could lose my nerve , I slipped the disc out of its sleeve and fed it into the slot . I did n't frequent VR parlors ; unfamiliarity and terror made me clumsy , but the boots , gloves , and helmet were designed to be userfriendly . Finally the light on the console glowed green , and a speaker said , " When you are ready , initiate the program by saying the word " Begin . " " Feeling as if I were about to be hurled from a plane at my own request , I did as instructed 9 - and was standing in the doorway of my room , the no-frills 2011 version , ten feet from Prepubescent Pam in what appeared to be the living flesh . Awkward with the gear , I took a couple of jerky steps into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed , opposite the girl absorbed in her diary . I sat right on the Dutch girl quilt and felt its nubbly texture under my hand . She looked up , startled , snapping the book shut and clicking the lock ; and at this first full-face view of her - synthesized from her profile with the aid of a couple of old holos - I almost stopped the program . But I did n't , I let it run . I let her scramble up , back away against the wall , say her first alarmed words to me , which were , not surprisingly , " What 're you doing here ? Who are you , anyway ? " They 'd worked with Liam 's earlier recording made at Hurt Hollow , tuning the voice to be slightly younger . This kid sounded exactly like an eleven-year-old who was a little bit scared . I was impressed . I was also utterly nonplused . But , again , I stayed with it . I answered her question the way I 'd planned to , when and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the person you 're going to be when you grow up . " I 'd been apprehensive about how she would react , but all she did was look surprised and say " Oh . " No real child would have settled for such an answer ; by accepting it , Little Pam identified herself as virtual , and let me recover some sense of control . But then she started giving me the once-over , and I saw her take in the size of my chest , and her eyes widen in dismay . " Nunh-unh , I 'm not gon na . hat big , no way ! If I ever get as big as you I 'm getting reduced ! " ril " io ettem reduced , " I said-and was astonished to realize I meant it , that I could n't in fact imagine why I 'd tolerated the despised breasts for so long . With plastic surgery booming worldwide , and an enormous aging clientele to bring prices down , I might have done something long ago about myself . Why had n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink lambswool sweater ? ) And that was all it took , a blunt remark from the kid , to shatter a twenty-five-year mindset ? If running a bradshaw could do that to you in the first five minutes ... thoroughly unnerved , I stared at Little Pam as I might have stared at a wizard . She glared back , suspicious of me now . " I 'm not waiting till I get as old as you are . What are you doing here , anyway ? " She sounded more accusing now than scared . I had the answer to that one ready too . " I came to see the diary . " Pam glanced down at the little book , still in her hand . " This ? " I nodded . " What for ? " " Because I ca n't remember what 's in it , and I 'm pretty sure I wrote something important in there . " " But why do you need mine ? Ca n't you just look up whatever it is yourself ? " " No , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coloring , Pam clutched the little book against her flat stomach . " I 'm keeping this diary forever ! " She shook her head so hard her straight brown hair whipped about her face . " I do n't believe you . You 're lying . You 're not me . " Getting into the question of why I did n't have the diary anymore was the last thing I wanted . It was all going wrong . " Pause , " I croaked desperately , and the figure of Pam froze in place , indignant expression and all , between the bed and the wall . I closed my eyes , realized I was sweating , thirsty , and exhausted , that the back of my head was pounding , and that I was going to have to stop pretty soon . Arguing with the kid was no good , and I knew instinctively that to wrestle the diary from her by force would n't work . She would have to show it to me of her own free will , and for that to happen I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took some deep breaths , telling myself to calm down . After a minute I opened my eyes and said " Resume , " and Pam came back to life , glowering at me . " Look . " I leaned across the bed and placed my right hand flat , fingers splayed , on the Dutch girl quilt . " Put your hand there , next to mine . " She did look , then looked at me , then back at my hand . Then , reluctantly , she gave a kind of capitulating snort . " I do n't have to . They 're the same . " " Do it anyway , okay ? " Pam hesitated , but sat back down on her side of the bed , laid the diary on the quilt , and spread out her left hand , long palm and spidery fingers , nails tapering instead of wide and blunt the way she wished , beside my right one . The turquoise thunderbird ring a house cleaner had stolen out of my closet , years ago , was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a size , though my skin was wrinkled and veiny and her nails were dirty . " Convinced ? " " They 're like a pair of gloves , only one 's been worn a lot and one 's practically new . " Little Pam withdrew the hand and hid her bony fingers in a fist . " Becky said in church last week that having big hands is good , because you can climb trees better . And I said , But yours are n't big for a woman . Mine are big for a woman . " " I 'd forgotten that exchange till she reminded me . " Ca n't get hands reduced , hon , not even in my time . " I might have added that I had had a nose job ; but Pam would be thirteen before she realized there was anything wrong with her nose , and besides , I could hardly claim credit . The rhinoplasty had been done over my violent objections . Dad was the one who really had n't liked my nose . Now Pam flashed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , okay ? If you can recite " Lone Dog " all the way through without making any mistakes , I 'll believe you 're me . " Smart move . I rattled off " Lone Dog , " a poem from our sixth-grade reader , without hesitation or error , and added , " Want me to quote " Now Chil the Kite brings home the night ' ? " It was a chapter heading from The Jungle Books - the very first Kipling poem I 'd ever learned by heart . " Never mind , " she said , relaxed and grinning now , " you win . You said it exactly like I do : " Oh , mine is still the lone trail , the hard trail , the best ! ' " " I hung onto that , anyway . " She nodded . " So how about it : can I see the diary ? " She looked down at it , shiny red , and up at me , and then she picked it up and reached it over to me across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little book , feeling her eyes on me , then clumsily pushed up the button that released the lock and opened it to the middle , June , 2011 . The diary had a lumpy feel because of the objects - straw , locket , some folded notes  --  pasted into it . I flipped slowly backward , then forward . May , April . July , August . All the pages were blank . 10 Julie was sympathetic , but not at all discouraged . " I guess we should have known it would n't be that simple , " she said , after we talked about how I 'd felt when I discovered the diary had no writing at all in it ( crushed ) , and how I felt now ( wildly agitated ) . " Look at what you accomplished , though . You figured out a way to establish your authenticity , and you won her trust . Not bad at all for a first session . Also , I think it 's significant that the diary was n't locked . " It had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go into that . " Not literally it was n't , but so what ? I was locked out anyway . " Despite Julie 's efforts , this still felt fairly shattering . " That kid , God , she really threw me . I did n't expect her to be such a tough customer . I ca n't imagine myself , at her age , standing up to a total stranger like that , scolding her for not having gotten a breast reduction ! " Julie grinned . " That 's not my impression . " Professional ethics forbade her to tell me that Liam had given her a different picture of me as a child , the jerk , but I was pretty sure that 's what she meant . " So where do I go from here ? Any ideas ? " I felt fresh out of them myself . The whole experience of the bradshaw , so far , had been one rude , exhausting shock after another . " It would probably be more useful if the ideas came from you , " Julie predictably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diary and the papers in the alligator binder . Undoubtedly you had an excellent reason at the time , but it would seem that your unconscious will let you see what you wrote in the diary only after being reassured that it 's safe to reveal the secret now . How to reassure it is the challenge . " " I see that , " I told her , " but is n't there more than one way to skin this cat ? What about trying hypnotherapy again : It 's been , what , four years ? Lots of water under the bridge since then . " Julie frowned . " Hypnotherapy is certainly still an option , and , as you say , a lot has happened since we tried it before , but I do n't think I 'd recommend it right now . Your history of resistance is n't the only reason I say this ; I 've also found that it 's usually better to stick to one approach until you 've given that approach a fair chance to work . If you should decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or permanently , we can talk about this again , but for now ..... " I was considering abandoning it , actually . " " Well , " said Julie , and I knew at once which side of that line she was about to come down on , " of course that 's your decision , but you 've been given a rare means of delving into your unconscious mind - something many of my patients would love to be able to make use of- and I hope you wo n't throw that opportunity away without giving it very careful consideration . " I said wryly , " I suppose you had no ulterior motive when you said you hoped I would n't " throw it away . " " Julie grinned broadly . " Of course not . " She waited , looking expectant , while I cudgeled my wits , but my mind was as blank as the pages of the diary had seemed . Finally I said , " Look , I know I was no great shakes as a hypnotic subject , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bradshaw operator . Could n't you at least suggest a strategy for coming up with some ideas ? " She chuckled . " Come on , Pam , you do n't need me to tell you how to do that . I wonder if , by trying to get me to tell you something you already know , you are n't actually saying you feel a need for help and support . " Actually , of course , she did n't " wonder " this at all . And she was right , I did know perfectly well what to do , really : keep track of my dreams , focus my meditations , write down every single detail I could recall about that year . It all added up to a lot of work , and I had plenty to do without any extras . Baby Ban riots had recently torn through the capital cities of Malawi and Burundi , and were now popping up all over South America . The Pope and the Head of the U.N . had requested a joint audience with a Hefn delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and her people , continued to work at a frantic pace on the population problem , a majority of the Hefn now favored abandoning humanity entirely . Alfrey and Godfrey , both overdue for the long sleep , were taking antihibernation drugs , which made their hair fall out in patches . They desperately needed Humphrey , but Humphrey would be sleeping for seven or eight more weeks at least , and they did n't dare wake him prematurely - too dangerous . Under such circumstances , even a bench warmer like myself was as busy as a one-armed paperhanger , processing computer data generated by the techs running time transceivers . It was almost impossible to have a personal life at all , let alone a personal crisis or epiphany . Julie was also right that I was asking for support ; but till she said so I had n't realized it , and was embarrassed . Little Pam never asked anybody for help . I glanced at the clock to see if the session were n't just about over . " Of course , " Julie went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do , and will continue to support you in every way I can . I do believe that you can use this bradshaw to find out some things you need to know about your past , in order to get on more constructively with your life . But whether or not you proceed with this , or proceed with it now , is entirely up to you . It was pure coincidence that the convention you attended was on your home turf . If you do n't want to work on the bradshaw just at present , that probably means you 're not ready , and that I was mistaken to think you were . " I shook my head . " No , no , you were n't mistaken . I am ready . And I 'll do it , the dream log and free-associative writing , the whole nine yards , but I still do n't want to , I wish I did n't have to - you might have been mistaken about that much anyway . " Julie smiled . " One day we must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're out of time for today , though , so I 'll limit myself to reminding you of one more thing you already know : that every word you put down in that little book is still in your memory somewhere . " " I do know that . Thanks . " Julie stood up and smiled . " Good luck on your next trip through the time portal . " 11 HE NEXT WEEK was a blur of conference calls and computer modeling , but I used whatever odd scraps of time I could find to prepare myself for my next encounter with the girl in the bare bedroom . To that end I got out the brown 2010 diary and browsed through the entries for the summer before the beginning of sixth grade : July 31 . Today Igot my cast off my arm . The muscle is little . dr. ogden said it wont hurt too long . We star gazed tonite . Pam I 'd broken my arm falling out of a August 1 . Nothing happened today . Hank Hank ? Trying out boys " names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming . We star gazed tonight . Sam August 3 . Last nite I slept downstairs I saw a viddy , It scared me. we went to Madison to get a water melin . Sam August 4 . Nothing happened today . Pam August 5. today was boring nothing happened not even token punctuation , apparently August 6 . Tonight I saw Dungeon of mutations . Hope I do n't have nightmares , but bet I will . I did calculus with Doug Doug Emmi , my math tutor . August 7 . Dear Diary , today was boreing we had hamburgers for supper Harry Apart from scaring myself with horror viddies , most of August did sound fairly " boreing . " I stargazed ; Dad was teaching me to recognize the easy constellations and locate bright stars like Arcturus and Vega . I went swimming at the quarry , played Tarzan with Charlie and Steve ( before the broken arm ) , played " Mumbley Peg " with Becky . Nothing the least bit remarkable there . I skipped ahead : August 24 . Today I packed for Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " good " grandmother , Mom 's mother - for a week 's visit , to end with my eleventh birthday on September 11 August 26 Dear D today I had fun sewing and playing dolls with Granny . A dexterous child , I could stitch a neat seam from the age of five or six ; and while I did n't " play dolls " in the usual way-a girly-girl thing to be despised and scorned-I loved making little pants and jackets for my two diminutive plastic boy dolls with patient Granny , the only adult who ever played with me . And now the diary reported again and again throughout the week : Today I had fun.l August 29. today I went to town with Granny &; saw Churchill downs . I got 2 books , the son of Tarzan eJ Woof howe hob . Pamfrey Woof Howe Hob was a book about the stranded Hefn mummified in a Yorkshire peat bog . Obviously , two months before their return , I was already interested in the Hefn , to the point of appropriating their - frey suffix into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hefn actually was called Pomfrey . August 31 . Dear D today Mom came . I missed her a lot . Dad definitely came too . Nothing about missing him . September 1 . Today Is my birthday . I am eleven years old . I got a boomclox , a tunic , a blue bedlamp ! , swimming goggles , and I blew out all the candles &; wished for an elec. canoe . Pam And in very faint pencil , along the margin of the bound edge : MOM ei ) DAD WOULD N'T SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME THEY MADE ME CRY BUT THEY DID N'T KNOW IT . Oh God . Now I remembered that birthday . My parents " strange refusal to sing was n't the worst of it . Granny had bought me a boomclox we 'd seen in a shop window on our ritual trip to town , unaware that Mom had also planned to give me one . When we got home to Scofield Mom showed me her boomclox  --  which I instantly recognized as superior to Granny 's in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking it back to the store , I could n't have it ; Granny 's clunky boomclox was the one I had to keep . It occurred to neither of us certainly not to me-that the redundant gift might have been exchanged for something else . I could visualize Mom 's " present " in perfect detail . The " clock " part of it was Swiss . Every hour on the hour a bugle blew and a little door flew open , releasing three adorable clockwork thoroughbreds , each with a tiny , crop-wielding jockey on its back . Horses and jockeys raced each other around a semicircle to another door that closed behind them . The programing was randomized ; you never knew which horse would win . I was less besotted with the Japanese " boombox " part , but no doubt its sound quality was excellent . I pleaded and begged to keep that boomclox , but to no avail : back to the store it went . Needless to say , my pleasure in Granny 's gift was a casualty of all this fuss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was a place-holder for the unmentionable bras from Grandma . September 2 . Mom sang to me late last night , and dad sang to me this morning . Now all I want is the boomclox mom got for me . Pam I was starting to feel sick . I shut the little book and put it away . 12 Homely , skinny Little Pam sat on the double bed covered with the Dutch girl quilt , one long leg bent double , a foot tucked beneath her , scribbling in the red diary with a yellow pencil . To the left of the door , on top of her bureau , squatted the boomclox , displaying the time and date in violet numbers . A little rack of CD 's squatted beside it , but no music was playing . The room was full of sunshine . " Hi , " I said , and sat down on the bed . Pam looked up , then dropped her pencil and snapped the diary shut . " You came back . " " Mm-hm . How are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you come back ? What were you so upset about ? " " I could n't read your diary . Sorry I rushed off like that . I want to try again , but first I want to talk to you about your boomclox . " Pam 's eyes turned toward it , then back to me . " What about it ? " " Granny gave you that last summer for your birthday . " She nodded . " But Mom got you one too , and she would n't let you keep it . " " No . She took it back . " " Why 'd she do that ? " Pam shrugged . " Granny bought me that one " cause I asked her to ... well , not exactly asked her to . We were walking along and I saw it in the window and told her I liked it , and she said did I want her to get it for my birthday and I said yes . But Mom , see , she 'd already gotten me one , and I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " " So you 're saying it 's kind of your fault that you could n't have the one Mom got for you . " " Well .... yeah . Because if I had n't asked for that one , I could have kept the cool one with the racehorses . " " Honey , " I said , leaning toward her , " it was n't your fault at all . Not at all . It was n't anybody 's fault , but Mom was mad at Granny for messing up her plan and she needed to blame somebody . And she could n't punish Granny , so she punished you . " " You mean - by taking the nice boomclox back to the store ? " " I really mean , by showing it to you at all . You were happy with Granny 's till you saw Mom 's , right ? There was no reason at all to show it to you if she meant to take it back . She just did it to make you feel bad , to get even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deserve it . I want you to understand that . I did n't understand it till I was a lot older than you are now , and I wish I had . " The girl stared at me , eyes filling with comprehension , then suddenly with shiny tears . " It was n't fair , " she said wonderingly . " No , it sure as heck was n't fair . And I 'll tell you something else : she wo n't ever pull anything like that on you again , because I 'm here now , and I wo n't let her . " " You wo n't ? " " I wo n't . I promise . " Pam rubbed the back of her bare wrist under her nose , snuffling a little . Then , without being asked , she handed the diary across the Dutch girls to me . I held it prayerfully for a moment . Then I let it fall open and looked down . 13 " It was all in code , " I reported to Julie , " that code Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write secret notes to each other in school . I looked down at the page - dreading that it would be blank again - and there were these lines of spirals and stars and triangles and pitchforks , in pencil . " " Did you keep the diary in code ? " " No , no , in ordinary cursive English ! I might 've tried the code for a page or two , but it would have been too slow for everyday , even if I 'd memorized it , which as far as I can recall I never did . " " Well , that 's fascinating . That 's really fascinating , " said Julie . Plainly , she meant it . The ways and means of bradshaws still had n't been studied much - too few cases - so this was all psychological terra semicognita . I could practically see the preliminary outline for the article she was planning to write coming together behind her eyes . " So after I checked to make sure the whole diary was in code , I asked the kid if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the alligator notebook ! " " Right . " " And ? " " She said , " I ca n't . It 's out in the hall closet , and I have to stay in my room . " And I realized that by setting up the transceiver in the doorway , we 'd trapped her in there . Nothing outside that one room was available to either of us . Well , then I had a kind of desperate brainwave ; I asked her if she could call Charlie or Steve on her phone and ask them to bring a copy of the key over and pitch it up to her through the window . " Julie sat back in her chair . " I take it that did n't work . " " How 'd you guess ? She did call them up , but both their phones just rang and rang . They were n't available . I do n't know why not , actually ; it seems to me that she ought to have been able to reach outside the room in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in the whole bradshaw phenomenon that keep you from proceeding in a way your own unconscious does n't endorse . But it 's like the shadow-memory phenomenon ; we do n't yet know why a virtual person can remember the things she remembers , but only those things , or why someone running the virtual program - like you - can accomplish some things and not others . " She leaned forward , toward the camera . " So : how did you feel when Charlie and Steve did n't answer their phones ? " " Defeated for this round , but not as discouraged as before . But I realized the phone idea was a bust , so I shut the program down till I could hash things over with you . " Julie smiled cheerfully . " Well ! It 's encouraging , is n't it ? First you get blank pages , then you get a code you once made up yourself . That feels like progress to me . " " To me too . It feels like things are moving forward , and that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to go . " Julie nodded . " I agree . Shall we start on the hashing-over , then ? What was different about this run ? What did you do this time , that you did n't do the first time ? " I could tell her that , all right . I 'd done what Bradshaw himself had recommended : in his own gooey phrase , I had " championed my inner child . " I 'd told the kid that our mother had punished her for something that was n't her fault , and that showing her the pretty clock was mean . I 'd also promised her that I would never allow this to happen again . In life it had happened many times over , and none of those meannesses could be undone . Still , to this eleven-year-old version of myself , I had made a commitment of protection . According to Bradshaw , this should do both of us good . The funny thing was , I 'd said what I 'd said spontaneously . I had n't been thinking about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd glared at that charmless boomclox on the bureau and told the kid what I 'd needed to hear myself - when I was Pam/Sam/Hank but never had . 14 Dream Log , 5/17/37. l live in a duplex . There are bears next door . The Fire Dept. comes to take them away , but the next day two cubs appear in the hallway of the half where I live , and rush into my room . I shove them out , but now the mother bear is in the hall . She sticks her paw in the doorway , tries to get in . The hasp on the door is frail and she bends the plate with her paw ; have to hold it shut and bend it back with my thumb so the bolt will engage . Several times I discover that the door 's slightly open . When I close it she attacks , but not when it 's ajar . Once the mother bear actually comes into my room , standing upright , and I escort her out . We both maintain our dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm able to control her in her presence , but when the door 's between us she becomes savage . There 's an antique table phone in the hallway , white , on a tall stalk . I rush out and grab it , run the cord under the door , slam the door . The bear attacks . I call the Fire Dept. and they come right away . The bears are hiding . One of the firemen wants me to sit beside him on a bed and read a book of stories for a purpose now unclear , except that it had something to do with catching the bears . Dream Log , 5/17/37 . I 'm weeding the flower beds of some house llive in with Mom , and accidentally break several tulip stalks . Mom yells angrily , but I reply that it does n't matter because we 'll never sell this house or move out of it . Will we ? She acts furtive and moves away . I run after her , shouting , screaming even , furious that she walked away like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brandishes a shiny black handgun ! I wrestle it away from her immediately - no question that I can dominate her in this literal , physical sense - but I understand that she 's sold the house , my home , right out from under me . I have to go to an orphanage nearby . I 'm crying and carrying on , terribly upset . We go past a gatehouse where Mom collects the money , big handfuls of bills . Then suddenly she 's lying face down in the long grass nearby , reduced to an impression of her body and outstretched hands , fingers extended , nails long and blood-red . The orphanage is horrible beyond description . The next day I put my hand into my pocket and realize I still have my keys . I decide to go spend one more night in my house , but when I get there I see a light in the basement , and opened , empty boxes in back : the newpeople have already moved in . Every night for years before my father died - but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaleidoscope of fractal patterns undulating like manta wings , reds , blues , rich and various , impersonal and pure . I took them completely for granted ; they 'd always happened and they always would . Those were the days . h : . * " Hi , " Liam said when I 'd ordered the screen to come on . " Just dashing in the door , were you ? " " Your powers of observation render me speechless , " I told him dryly . I 'd run in from the back yard and was puffing and flushed ; we were having another heat wave in Salt Lake . I almost had n't bothered to catch the phone , but now I was glad I 'd made the effort . Liam and I had n't talked in six weeks - not since Kentucky and the bradshaw . " What were you doing ? " " Feeding the robins , out back . At this moment , six fledgling robins call me mother . " For the past couple of summers I 'd been hand-raising orphaned and/or injured birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this year I was really much too busy to be doing it . Although the four healthy babies were flying well , all six still expected to be fed several times a day . I 'd push open the screen door to the back yard and the quartet of good fliers would dive out of the apricot tree , straight for my head . Adolescent robins are n't little , tiny birds ; I could n't wait for this stage to be over . " Feeding them what ? " Liam wondered . " Worms and bugs ? No wonder you 're out of breath . " I shook my head . " Dry dog food softened in water . High protein content . Comes in a bag . " " Oh . Well , I wo n't keep you , I know you 're as swamped as we are here . I just thought I 'd check in to see how the bradshaw 's going . " We exchanged looks . " Slowly , " I said , " since you ask . It does seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The second shot hit the bull's-eye ? " " I think so . Hit the target , anyway . I really appreciate your staying to shoot it , by the way . " " Yeah . " Liam regarded me thoughtfully . " You 're welcome , I guess . Although to describe Eddie as pissed about it would be a feeble representation of the truth . " " Apologize to him for me . What about you - does this call mean you 've decided to forgive me ? " " For making me admit that I ca n't afford to lose you out of my life ? I 'll probably never forgive you for that . But Eddie being furious , the interminable train trip I suffered through , etc. , etc. , that 's all water under the bridge . I called because I was interested . " And because you miss waking me up when something 's on your mind , I thought but did n't say . We both knew why he 'd called . Things being what they were with Liam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other eventually . " I have n't got time right now to fill you in completely , " I told him , " but in a nutshell , I ca n't read the diary . The first time I tried , the pages were completely blank except for the printed dates and lines . The second time the writing was all in code . " " Code ? " " A code my friends and I made up to pass notes in school . Stars , triangles , pitchforks . I do n't have a clue which symbols stood for what letters anymore . " " Codes can be cracked . Bring in an expert . " I shook my head . " I thought about that , but I 've got this hunch that if the answer 's going to be worth knowing , I have to discover it via the right process . Anyway , Julie would n't approve . " Liam laughed . " Let me guess . She 'd say , " You 're the real expert , are n't you ? You 'll figure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed with him - Liam , a clever mimic , had nailed Julie exactly - before adding , " She 's probably right , that 's the hell of it . Listen , sorry to cut you off so fast but I was supposed to be back in my office five minutes ago . " As usually happened when I tried to hang up first , this triggered a perverse refusal in him to end the conversation . " Okay , but just tell me , what about the straw and the locket , were they in the diary ? " " They were there . Just no writing . " " I get it , " he said eagerly . " Because you already knew they were in there and what they looked like . What you ca n't see is what you ca n't remember . " " I guess so . " I looked at my watch . " She remembers . You two kids need to learn to work together . " " Liam - " " Okay ! So long ! Call me if you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm watching a preview of a viddy flick . A man with sharp features is driving a car like the one we had before the Hefn came . There 's a passenger in the back seat , a woman . In his rearview mirror the driver sees the woman pull up her dress , which is like a long T-shirt , and whammo : out falls a perfectly beautiful set of male genitals . The driver sees this in the mirror ; " we- ( viewers ) see it directly . I rent the flick to watch in bed and fast-forward through it , trying to find that scene . Suddenly Mom climbs into the bed with me and lights a cigarette ! I scream at her to " Get out of my personal space ! " and force her out of the bed physically ; there 's a violent tussle and she 's upset and cries . She goes off . If feel very bad and have an impulse to go after her , but fall asleep instead . Dream Log 6/13/3 7 . I 'm awakened within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her crib , in the laundry room next to my bedroom in this house . The sink ( actually full of orphaned Mallard ducklings in a cage at present ) has vanished , and the crib stands in its place . Both rooms are black as pitch , but I get up , grope my way to the little girl , and put my arms around her . At the same instant I become aware that Dad is sitting in a rocking chair where the washer ought to be . He 's facing the crib , and he 's stone blind . He rocks in a gentle , regular rhythm , a little smile on his face . ( This does n't sound terrifying , but I woke up terrified . ) Later : another dream . I 'm running the bradshaw . Little Pam and I are sitting across from each other on the bed . Again I ask her to try to get the code key for me . She activates her phone , which has turned into a modern wall-mounted videophone , and places the call . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did at fifteen . When Pam explains that we need his help , he reaches right through the screen and hands her a big iron key like a dungeon key from some old horror show . " You kids need to work together , " he says . 17 Julie frowned and rubbed the sides of her nose with her extended fingers . " Let 's go back to basics for a bit . We know your father was inappropriate with you , and that your mother turned a blind eye . We know that his behavior made you so anxious in early adolescence that you developed a dissociative disorder , though you did n't realize his sexualizing of your relationship was the cause . You 've spent a lot of time connecting feelings to events and doing the necessary grief work . What I 'm wondering now is , where 's all this anger at your mother coming from ? " " The business about the boomclox ? " " That 's a factor , of course , but I 'm not convinced that that accounts for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dreams too . Could you be angry at her for leaving you the bradshaw , and afraid of what you might learn ? " " If I could read the damn diary , " I told her wearily , " maybe I 'd know . " 18 " Oh good ! I was hoping you 'd come back , " said Little Pam . " I wanted to ask you about something . " I sat down on the Dutch girl quilt . " Shoot . " " You know that time last spring when Steve and Charlie and I had a fight before church , and I did n't want to sit with them so I sat with Ninnie ? " Ninnie was a family friend , older than my parents , who occupied the same front pew every Sunday . Surprised that the program would let her bring up a subject I had n't introduced first , I said " Sure I do . " " And before the sermon started , Dad made me leave and come home with him ? " I nodded . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were walking along next to him , trying not to cry . And finally he said , in this terribly angry voice , Why were n't you sitting with the boys ? " And you said - " at this point Little Pam chimed in , and we chanted together , " I do n't want to talk about it . " " And then , " Pam finished , " he said , " I do n't suppose you 'll ever want to talk things over with me . " " She brought it all so near . " He sounded disgusted . You were totally bewildered . The whole thing just seemed like some big craziness . " " Yeah . Then we got home and I ran inside and threw myself on Mom , bawling my head off . She said , " What in the world is the matter ? " But I could n't talk , I could n't tell her . And anyway , I did n't know . " We sat silent for a bit . Finally I said , " So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me soberly . " Well , you knew why Mom showed me the good boomclox before she took it back . I thought you might know what Dad was so mad about that time . " I got up , went around the foot of the bed , and sat down next to Pam . I put my arms around her tense little body and pulled her against me . She did n't resist , but neither did she respond . I did n't expect her to ; Little Pam thought hugs were mushy , or thought she ought to think so . " I did finally figure it out , " I told her . " He was mad because if you were n't going to sit with Steve and Charlie , he wanted you to sit with him . " She pulled away open-mouthed , totally flummoxed . " With him ? " I knew , of course , that the idea of sitting with Dad had never crossed her mind . Mom had n't been in church that day for some reason ; if she had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninnie . But Dad , by himself ? It simply never occurred to us . It would never have occurred to us in a million years . " Now I 've got one for you , " I told her , releasing her from the circle of the embrace . " What happened next ? After Dad came in . I ca n't remember . " " Mom just told me to go on up and change my clothes . They were talking downstairs . Then we had Sunday dinner . " So the episode had just been dropped . Mom had probably remonstrated with Dad for dragging us out of church , but neither of them had talked with us about it later , explained anything . We had n't expected them to . They backed each other up through silence , believing instinctively that if nothing were said , it would be the same as if nothing had happened . I tended to think of Dad as the " problem , " but it was n't only Dad . And suddenly I had a flash of insight about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their very different ways , had been stupid and cruel about plenty of things - and that neither had protected us against the stupidities and cruelties of the other . Now I hugged Little Pam again , hard . " Dad wants to be closer to you , but he does n't know how to make it happen . Then he gets frustrated when he can tell you do n't enjoy being with him . But it 's not your job to fix that , honey . He 's the dad , it 's his job , only he does n't know how to do his job - and that 's not his fault , either , but it sure as shootin " is n't yours , and it was really , really wrong of him to blame you and scare you like that . " Her arms clutched back at me , then let go . She wiped her nose on the back of her hand , as before , and sniffed a couple of times . Our tears always mostly ran down our nose , where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go now , but I 'll be back . " 19 " We 're kind of getting to know each other , " I reported to Julie . " Reminiscing almost . It 's nice . She 's a pretty unattractive kid , actually , but we sure do have a lot in common . " " And she needs you so badly , too . " I nodded . " I 'd like to shake John Bradshaw 's hand . All that hokey , cloying inner-child stuff ? The hell of it is , he was right . " And a couple of sessions later : " We 're sitting on opposite sides of the bed , chatting about her birthday-in 2013 she 's got a birthday coming up - and she hands me the diary , I let it fall open in the middle - not really paying that much attention , for once - and then I see there 's writing on the page , a pencil scribble , and my heart jumps into my throat . But then a second later I see what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets upset - she thinks I 'm laughing at her , at something she wrote . I had to convince her that was n't it . Here , I keyed it out for you . " I held the pad close to the screen so Julie could see , and read aloud : " Kotar Tublat yud gom-lul kambo yang ta nala zor den . Kotar b'wangTublat om zan dano histah , ho yummas Kotar tand gree-ah ho gree-ah histah unk lul . " Julie 's baffled expression made me laugh again . " You do n't recognize it ? It 's Ape English  --  Tarzan talk ! " Julie leaned forward , squinting at the screen . " Tarzan talk ? You mean , it 's a language ? " " But of course ! My pal Steve and I learned a whole list of words of what was supposed to be the language of the Great Apes , from the Tarzan books , and we 'd talk to each other in Ape while we 'd be playing in the woods . It 's a grammarless language , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus tar-Mighty White . Pretty braggy name for such a scrawny kid ! Steve was Tublat-it means Broken Nose , but he just liked the sound of the word . Actually , should have been Tublat , I was the one whose nose had been broken . Not that I knew that at the time . " " Pam , the suspense is killing me . What does this passage say ? " I laughed again , the Tarzan talk made me feel so happy . " Sorry to disappoint you , after all the build-up , but not much . It basically just says we went to the river bluff and swang on the rope swing and played sex games  --  Steve used to let me play with his penis and watch him pee , and I 'd let him kiss me . " " You 're dismissing sexual play as " not much , " given your particular history ? " " What I mean is , nothing new . I 've always remembered going to the woods with Steve after school , and the stuff we did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that says sex games ? " " I held the pad up again . " I 'm paraphrasing . Yumma was our word for " kiss " - we made it up , Burroughs does n't supply one . The Great Apes probably did n't go in for a lot of kissing . It says " I held Steve 's long skinbone snake , many kisses , I did n't like that too much but I love it when his snake pees . " More or less . " Pee " is " go water , " literally - unk lul . " " Did you write in the diary in Ape , or is this another involuntary translation ? " " Hmm . " I considered this . " Actually , something as purple as this passage I might have written in Ape . In high school , when I wanted to record something embarrassing or private , I 'd switch into German . " " But was the rest of the diary in Ape ? " I shook my head . " The other pages were blank , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ! This is all extremely interesting " said Julie with great relish . " Your unconscious is still protecting the diary 's contents using a code from childhood , but now it 's a code you 're able to read . More progress ! " " Yeah , " I said . " I believe it is. " 20 " How are the robins doing ? " Liam inquired . He 'd called me twice more , very late at night , waking me on both occasions ; it was like old times . P-mail would have been far less intrusive , but he did n't like p-mail ; he liked exchanging live comments with a face on-screen , even a grouchy , sleepy face . That being so , it was clever of him to ask about the birds . " Wingy , Pesky , or Gimpy ? " " These names you give them stun me with their originality . Gimpy would be ... " " The sick one - the one the dog roughed up , that 's got everything wrong with her , leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever hear a bird cough ? " " I did n't know they could . " " Me neither . Well , she 'd been hobbling around for a week on one normal foot and one fisted-up foot . Then yesterday , all of a sudden the bad foot opened up and bingo : two sets of . toes ! And I know she has at least partial vision back in the bad eye . So the news on Gimpy is cautiously good . " " I had no idea birds caught cold . " " Well , it 's a flulike virus of some sort . I stick the dogfood in and sometimes she spits it back out - her beak hurts , she ca n't swallow big pieces-and it comes out slimy . Yesterday I saw her blow a bubble . And she 's always scraping her beak on things to clean it off . Then there 's the cough , this little pathetic hack hack . " " You 're breaking my heart , " said Liam . " Actually , you sort of are . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feather duster that got caught in a fan . Nobody thought she could possibly recover enough to be released , but after her foot unclubbed I started to hope . " I had n't mentioned the bradshaw . Finally Liam could stand it no longer and asked how things were going . " Still making slow progress , " I told him . " If we get a breakthrough , you 'll be among the first to know . " " Mind if I stick my , ah , beak in a little ? " And when I grinned and did n't say no , " I do n't mean to mess with whatever Julie 's strategy is here , but I keep wondering if she 's suggested that you ask the kid to help you . " I frowned . " No , I do n't think so . Not even implicitly . Julie 's been bending over backward not to make suggestions , even when I request them . She does interpretive stuff , but she 's maintained the position from the start that I 'll hit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . " I waited for him to go on , but he screwed his face into a skeptical mask and just sat there . Finally I said , " Come on , say what you 're thinking . How can she help me out ? The kid . " " See , Pam , " said Liam , " it never occurs to you to ask for help . You did n't ask me to help you , when you realized you 'd picked the wrong event and needed me to re-record your bradshaw . Instead you put our whole relationship on the line . You forced me to help you . " I blinked . " I should n't have had to ask . You should have offered . " Liam shook his head impatiently . " Maybe so , but that 's not my point . My point is , you help people without thinking twice , but you do n't expect people to help you , you always think you have to do it by yourself . If help 's offered , you accept it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very trait in Little Pam , of course , and been uncovering its roots in her family life . " Hunh . Okay , I accept that . But you kept repeating that you were n't going to miss that plane no matter what . Are you saying now that all you wanted was for me to ask you nicely ? " " To tell you the truth , " he admitted , " I 'm not absolutely sure . Eddie was piling on the pressure , I might 've felt you were asking too much . I do n't mean you were , " he added quickly , " but that 's beside the point . What I would 've decided back then is about me ; and the point I 'm trying to make now , and want to stick to , is about you not asking people for help . " " I did ask Julie , " I reminded him . " So you did . And she said you 'd solve the puzzle by yourself when you were ready . But are n't you forgetting something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yourself ! Julie 's probably going nuts , wondering when you 're finally gon na figure that out . " 21 Little Pam looked up from the diary and gave me a big smile . " Hi ! " " Hi yourself , " I said . " How 're you feeling ? " " Better . Lots better . I love it when you come here . " I sat down on " my " side of the bed . She held the diary out to me ; but this time I smiled and shook my head . " I guess we both know by now that I ca n't read it by myself . So I 've had an idea : how would you feel about reading it to me ? " She looked surprised , then uncertain . " Out loud ? " " Just the parts you do n't mind reading out loud . You could skip anything you did n't want me to hear . " " It 's not ... I mean , I do n't mind you knowing things . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it I do n't like to say out loud . " Little Pam was almost morbidly hypersensitive to the power of words . " I know . You could leave those parts out , though , that would be fine . " " We-e-e-e-l-l ... " She wrinkled her fleshy nose , still not sure . Pressuring this child was the very last thing I wanted to do ; I reflected that Liam was wrong and Julie right about not pushing things in this direction quite so soon . " You do n't have to read any of it to me if you do n't want to , honey , " I reassured her . But she surprised me . " No , I do want to . Really . It 's just , you know , embarrassing . " She bent the covers back , ruffling the pages . " Where should I start ? " In answer , I sang the mother 's part from the end of Amahl and the Night Visitors : " ' Are you sure , sure , sure ? " " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in on the joke . " Well then , how about just starting at the beginning ? " Whereupon , to my inexpressible relief , Little Pam flipped to the front of the red book and began : " January 1 , 2011 . We went to the candlelight service last night and I stayed up till midnight . Today I worked on linear algebra . January 2 . Today I went to Doug 's and we did linear algebra . I got all the problems right . It looked like snow all day but it never snowed . January 3 . Today it snowed . I went sledding with Charlie on the scenic drive . There was a hefn on the viddy tonight , his name is Pomfrey ! ! January 4 ... " I listened to her flat voice speaking these flat facts . After a while I shifted around and lay down on my back on the bed ; and when Pam broke off inquiringly , " I 'm just getting comfortable , " I explained . " Do n't stop , you 're doing great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today I went to Hurt Hollow with Dad . We walked down the hill . I got to feed the goats . " I laced my fingers together across my stomach , closed my eyes , and let this voice possess me . Time passed , or was borne along on the all-butexpressionless murmur I floated within . Once I opened my eyes and glanced over to ask , " Are you getting tired We could do some more next time . " " Nunh-unh , I 'm fine , " Pam said , and went right on : " May 12 . Today we came to Louisville . May 13 . I went to the store for Granny and we played Chinese checkers . Aunt Maude is n't feeling too well . I came to Grandma 's for supper . May 14 . Today we came home . I slept with Granny the first night and I went to Grandma 's the second night . I fell off the couch in the middle of the night . I found three four-leaf clovers and one six-leaf clover . May 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pam had gone on without me . I lay in the dark by myself , breathing in the hateful smell of Grandma 's living room , knowing that if I opened my eyes a tall shape would be stooping over the couch , but if I kept my eyes closed I would n't have to acknowledge its presence . 22 " Who do you think it might be ? " Julie asked quietly . I 'd called her from the VR parlor 's public phone , whose cheap lens added ten years to her age ( though the late hour may have added one or two . " I feel like all that 's keeping me from dying of terror is that I still do n't know . " Just thinking about it , I shook like an aspen leaf . " But it must have been Edgar , Dad 's stepfather , Edgar Cranfill . You remember I talked about him . A really bad alcoholic . Arrested for exhibitionism one time . On our visits he 'd either be sleeping it off in the basement or sitting at Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was supposed to act like I was glad to see him . " My teeth chattered as I said this . Julie looked concerned . " Time for a break ? You could take a couple of weeks off , get used to the idea of what you 'll be confronting - " I shook my head . " No , I have to go right back in . The kid has no idea why I ran away like that . One second I 'm lying on the bed with my eyes closed and the next I 'm halfway out the door . She had this jolted look on her face-I do n't even remember getting off the bed , I must have levitated ! I have to get right back , as soon as I calm down a little bit . " Julie nodded . " Sounds like you 're getting the hang of the gear , anyhow . Listen now : call me after you end the program tonight . Do n't try to prove how tough you are . I 'm here , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you pace yourself appropriately with this , okay ? " " Okay , " I said shakily . " Thanks . " 23 " Let 's go back to the beginning of May , all right ? " I 'd apologized for bolting , and resettled myself on the bed . " I 'd just like to go over that part again . We can do the rest another time . " " Okay , but I 'm really not tired , so if you want me to keep going ... " She found the place and began to read . " May 1 . Charlie built a soap box racer and he gave me a ride but he pushed me too fast and it turned over . Mom made me come in . May 2 ... " I waited tensely for the trip to Louisville , but knowing it was coming left me too well defended . The replay was unrevealing . Despite the kid 's protestations that she was n't tired , I stopped the bradshaw when she 'd read to the end of May ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to Julie and was stowing the gear in the hall locker when the pay phone beeped and blinked on , and Humphrey 's dear hairy face peered benevolently down upon me . " Hello , Pam Pruitt , " he chirruped . His was the very last face I expected to see there . " Humphrey ! I thought you were still hibernating ! However did you find me ? " I glanced up and down the hallway , but at this late hour we had the place to ourselves . " I was asleep , " he said , " but someone woke me . " The Hefn stayed awake round the clock for half the year , then slept for several months together , bedded down in their mother ship on the moon . Since only aliens ever went there , this rude arousal might mean that Humphrey was in trouble again for supporting us humans . " Why 'd they do that ? Will you be okay ? " " I will be fine ; I was to awaken in a few weeks " time in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should initiate your bradshaw during my long sleep , and it should approach a climax , someone was to wake me . My dear , you must not waver in your resolve . You must complete the bradshaw , as quickly as you can . " It struck me then that Humphrey had eavesdropped on this evening 's session . The Hefn were within the terms of their sales agreement to do that at any time , but I did n't like it that Humphrey had n't given me advance notice , and found it irritating to be urged not to quit , when I 'd had no thought of quitting . I said , rather resentfully , " Why " must " I complete it ? " " Because there is so much important work to be done , and you are so badly needed . " " Humphrey , " I said wearily , " You know I ca n't do the real work anymore , and what the Sam Hill has the bradshaw got to do with it anyhow ? " " We shall see . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and sleep now , my dear . I will stay in touch . " 24 E WAS N'T GOING to tell me anything more , and I was too tired to think , so I did as he instructed : I biked home and went to bed and to sleep . In my dream I 'm lying again on the Dutch girl quilt , afloat within the uninflected sphere created by Little Pam 's reading voice . I ca n't make out the words , but behind my closed eyelids I see myself get up from Grandma 's living-room couch and wander into the kitchen . Dad is standing near the sink in the dark . He 's aware of me but takes no notice and does n't stop what he 's doing . At first I do n't understand what this is , but suddenly I realize his pants are unfastened and he 's masturbating with his right hand , intending to ejaculate into the kitchen sink . In his left hand he 's holding a metal bowl full of water and crushed ice , swirling the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating-off . My reactions are two , and contradictory . I 'm very turned on . And I 'm frantic to get out of there . In my panic flight from my monstrous father I try desperately to wake up . I labor and groan , try to pry my eyes open , struggle against sleep with all my strength ; but I 'm weak as water . Despite everything I can do I 'm still supine on the bed , and Little Pam 's voice is still droning on , when out of the fog of words her voice says clearly : Take Two . - and I 'm back on the couch in Grandma 's house . It 's the middle of the night , and I 'm lying on my back in the dark , on top of someone or something whose meaty hands I 'm holding . Terror has suffused me utterly . I get up and walk into the bathroom , holding on with horror and loathing to the meaty hands . I 'm just about to look in the mirror over the basin to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Take Three , says Little Pam , and then Take Four , and each time the ghastly bradshaw of my dreaming starts the program at the same place : me on the couch in Grandma 's dark living room , in the middle of the night . Every " take " is different , but many of the same elements are incorporated into each : a male masturbator , a basin or sink usually full of water , myself as a very young child - much younger than eleven - in the role of participant/observer , and the emotional conflict of arousal and extreme fear . 25 " We 're getting close , " Julie said the next morning , stating the obvious . " How do you feel ? " " Terrible . Like horses have been kicking me all night . " " You do n't look too chipper , I have to admit . Maybe you can catch a nap later . Have you had dreams like these before ? " I massaged my aching temples with my fingers . " Yeah , a few . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about my cousin Will standing naked in front of a bathroom basin full of water , while two " pornographic hands " - that 's how they were styled in the dream - came up out of the water to help him masturbate . And the one about ... well , about me sloshing Liam 's penis around in the basin of a hotel bathroom , while a strange man in a navy blue suit stood by with his shriveled genitals exposed , saying You can do anything you like with these . " That 's all I can remember , there might be others . " " Affect of that last one ? " " Mixed . I wanted nothing to do with the icky man and his icky organs , and told him so , but still I touched his dick when he invited me to . " " Terror ? Arousal ? " " Not that I recall . More like disagreeableness . Look , Julie ... " She waited , holding perfectly still . " Would you consider monitoring the next one ? I 'm scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm asking . I 'm not sure I can do this by myself . " She smiled and nodded , looking and sounding as positive as possible , to reassure me . " You probably can , but why should you ? I 'd say right now is an excellent time to bring in flank support . Did Humphrey agree to monitor as well ? " " I did n't ask him to . He said he 'd keep in touch , that 's all . I tried to reach him this morning in Santa Barbara but he did n't answer , and I 'm not even sure that 's where he was calling from . Liam had n't seen him - did n't even know he was awake . Something seriously weird is going on . " " Well , " said Julie briskly , " Humphrey and I may have different perspectives and agendas , but we both agree that finishing your bradshaw is all-important . And whether he 's there or not , I will be , whenever you want me . " So the following evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my childhood . That is , she was in VR hookup in Washington . She could monitor my vital signs - pulse rate , brain wave patterns , skin moisture  --  through transmitters built into the VR equipment ; I 'd connected myself up to them for the first time for this session . She could see everything in two dimensions on a lifesize screen : me and Little Pam , the bed with its handmade quilt , the bureau and its hideous boomclox , the row of books along the baseboard , the window streaming with sun . She could hear what both of us said , and if I were to address her directly she could answer me through the transmitters in my helmet ; but , unless I did that , Little Pam would be unaware of the third party present at our meeting . Pam could n't see me , either , till I passed through the doorway . I stood outside for a minute first , readying myself , watching her write in the red book , trying to discern outward signs that she 'd repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her surface seemed perfectly blank . If there was trauma there - and surely there was - it was very deeply buried . I tapped on the door frame and stepped through smiling . " Hi , kiddo . " " Hi ! Want me to finish the diary now ? " She was all eagerness , relishing the attention . " That would be way cool . " I flopped down on the bed and , deepening my voice , sang Balthasar 's question to Amahl , " ' Are you ready ? " " " ' Yes , I 'm ready ! " " " ' Let 's go , then . " " " June 1 , " she read promptly . " It was pretty today . I saw a yellow warbler and an indigo bunting at the Point . June 2 . Mom wants me to take dancing lessons and I do n't want to . I watched the Hefn program on the viddy . It was good . Dad got me a book at the library about the Hefn for my school report . June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons , they cost money . Today Grandma came with Uncle Tommy . June 4 ... " - and , without even an instant in which to signal Julie , I 'm afloat upon the surface of the light flat voice - and watch myself get up from Grandma 's couch and wander through the dark house to the bathroom . The door is partly closed . There 's a light on inside , and a radio playing lively music . I reach up for the doorknob and push the door open wider . Uncle Tommy is standing at the basin , running it full of water . He 's back late from the race track , he 's been playing the horses . He jumps when he sees me peering around the door - I 've startled him - but then he smiles . " Hi , hon. Wan na see somethin " nice ? C'm on in here , I 'm gon " show you somethin " real nice . " Tommy is wearing his dark blue sailor uniform ; he joined the Navy when he was sixteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I see that the front of his pants is unfastened and hanging down , and behind the square flap is a round opening like a cave , and coming out of the cave is a thing like a big white snake . My eyes fill with the white snake , and two feelings seize me simultaneously . One is intense sexual excitement and fascination . The other is guilt : I know I 'll be punished if anybody catches me in here . I know this from the sneaky way Tommy 's talking . He smells terrible when he talks . " See it ? " Uncle Tommy says , and I ca n't help myself , I come closer . I put up my hands and hold onto the edge of the basin . There 's a towel folded against the basin 's front edge , and the snake is lying on the towel . " See , now , this is my peter . Ever see a peter like this before ? " I shake my head . " Well , it 's kinda dirty so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just wet your hands and soap " em up real good " - he holds my hands under the faucet and rubs soap on the palms - " and then you can help wash my peter for me . " I put my slippery hands around the snake and Tommy says , " Oh , Jesus . " Then he says , " Just wash it off real good , just rub it up and down . " I know I 'm in terrible danger , but the snake feels hard and smooth . I love the feel of it . I love the silky skin of its pink head shaped like a blind frog 's head , and the long shaft like a smooth enormous finger gloved in kid . I lean my elbows on the sink and dunk the snake in the warm water and trace the lovely curve of its head with my soapy fingers ; and then suddenly something happens . Tommy grabs my hands in his big ones and squeezes them hard around his peter , and stuff spurts out of the end , dirtying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peter and moans . Is he crying ? I do n't like this part , but Uncle Tommy 's gasping like he 's been running , he wo n't listen and he wo n't let go of my hands . The sleeves of my pajamas are wet , I 'm trying to pull away and he wo n't let me go , and I start to get scared , and I start to cry . And then the door swings wide open and it 's barefoot Grandma in her nightgown with her hair all mashed flat on one side , saying " Tommy Cranfill , what in tamation are you doin " to that child ? Pammy , you git yourself back into bed right this minute . " I ca n't , though . In the shock of being discovered , to my intense horror and shame I 've wet my pajamas. 26 Little Pam 's voice came abruptly into focus . " July 4 . Today is the Fourth of July . We had a church picnic in Happy Valley . I climbed up the falls . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Point . July 5 - you 're crying , " she blurted , sounding scared out of her wits . She could n't stand to see people cry , even other kids . She 'd never seen Mom cry in her whole life . I lifted my head from the pillow and smiled shakily to reassure her . " Yeah , I am , a little . It 's okay to cry if you 're sad , you do n't have to be afraid of it . Nothing bad will happen . " " Are you sad ? What about ? " " I ca n't explain right now , but do n't worry , everything 's okay . You 're not making me sad . Go ahead , keep on reading . " So she did , nervously at first , then relaxing as the diary reabsorbed her attention . I lay there feeling the heavy rise and fall of my chest , listening , accepting what I heard ; and finally " August 25 , " she read , " Today I packed for Louisville . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packet . That 's all ! That 's what I was writing when you came in ! " She slapped the book shut and beamed at me . I sat up groggily ; I was exhausted . " You 're going to Louisville tomorrow ? " She nodded . " Will you stay at Grandma 's part of the time ? " Pam 's face slipped a fraction . " I do n't know . If Mom wants me to . " I circled the bed , sat beside her and pulled her against me fiercely . " If you stay at Grandma 's , here 's what I want you to remember . You do n't have to do anything if it makes you feel bad . Not even if a grownup tells you to , and not even if you 've done it before , and not even if Momgets mad at you : if it makes you feel bad , do n't do it . Refuse . Say no . " I leaned back and looked into her face , brushing her stringy hair back from her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can say no . " She frowned , puzzled ; she 'd been conditioned all her life to believe that children were n't to bother , inconvenience , or disobey adults . She 'd never been taught to protect herself , and - because Tommy 's abuse , visit after visit , got consistently repressed - she had no idea why I was telling her these things in such a serious way . She said as much . " I do n't get it . " " Never mind . Just remember what I said . Promise . " " Okay , I promise . " And then , seemingly taking herself by surprise , she lunged against me in an awkward hug . I hugged her back , stood up carefully ; I felt heavy as lead . " Time to go now . Thanks very , very much for reading me your diary , honey , it 's been a huge help . Did you leave much out ? " " Only a little part , about a book I read . " " Was it Shane* " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . I do n't blame you a bit . " Bye now . Have a great time at Granny 's . " I tottered to the doorway , smiled back at beaming Pam , and closed the program down . " Julie ? Did you get all that ? " " I did indeed . My phone 's set up ; we can talk right now , as soon as you 're out of your gear . " 27 Julie asked dutifully , " Are you okay ? " but clearly she was dying to debrief me , and when I nodded she cut straight to the chase . " When Pam Junior read the entry for June 3 , you slipped into deep trance . Pure alpha waves for eight minutes , then back to normal . What happened ? " I told her . " I do n't think it was a dream . I think it was a memory , triggered by the reference to Grandma and Uncle Tommy . " " Do you know , in all this time you 've never mentioned an uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There did n't seem to be any reason to . He was Dad 's half-brother , the son of Grandma and Edgar the Souse . Much younger . A very minor figure in my life , or so I thought . I had totally forgotten that Tommy lived in Grandma 's house during the years Mom used to make me sleep over there on Saturday nights . He was between marriages and probably out of a job . But that was later ; in the memory dream ? - whatever , he was wearing Navy dress blues . And I could n't have been more than three , I had to reach up for the doorknob . By the time I 've been talking about , four-plus years later , he was n't in the Navy anymore . " Julie had her hot-on-the-trace look ; her eyes were glittering . " As a child , how did you feel about Uncle Tommy ? " I was almost too tired to think , but I tried . " Actually , I kind of liked him when I was little- he played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking . Though funnily enough , when I cleaned out the house after Mom died I came across some old holos of him and was surprised at how ... dissolute and seedy he looked in them . Not handsome at all . Even in a portrait made when he was about twelve there was something wrong , and I know when I was a kid I thought he looked so cute in that picture . It fits , does n't it ? Julie- " I leaned toward the screen . " What do you think ? Memory or dream ? It did n't seem like a dream . No symbols , perfect narrative coherence- " " Well , it was n't REM sleep . As I said , according to the readings you were n't asleep at all ; it was a trance state , a very deep involuntary hypnotic trance . Now , I know you 're done in , and we 'll stop soon , but I 'd really like to hear anything at all that you can remember about Uncle Tommy . " At once , to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's something . One time-I was ten or eleven -I wrote , " Souls I want to save : Uncle Tommy " on the fly leaf of my Bible . And I 've always remembered I did that , because Mom told him I 'd written it . According to her , Tommy said he appreciated that and he 'd think about it real hard . She was pleased , she thought Tommy was pretty much of a bum . She was pleased with me for wanting to save his soul . " Thinking about it , I got agitated . " I know exactly where I was sitting- in the living room , at the hallway end of the couch - when Mom told me she 'd done this , beaming with approval . I pretended not to mind , but I was embarrassed and stricken to realize she 'd been snooping into my private stuff . " Julie shook her head , imagining our family . " Why do you suppose you wanted to save his soul ? That seems kind of unexpected . " A wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy required in heavy-duty therapy was a constantly renewed astonishment . In the midst of this wave I sat and remembered how Little Pam had read out the facts of her encoded life , in terse declarative sentences , skipping over the one place where her feelings were so intense they 'd forced her to try to put them into words . But out of this assembling heap of dry little facts a static charge had built up and built up until the bolt had struck and stunned me . Only me : Little Pam felt nothing , as I 'd felt nothing when I was Little Pam . Her feelings had been shoved down into a place where they would fester in the dark for nearly thirty years , because for thirty years there was nobody in her life who wanted to help her not suffer so much , or so she believed without question . I answered Julie as best I could . " I do n't know why . Maybe I thought , if he was saved , he 'd leave me alone . There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love your enemy " thing . Tommy had an awful life , both Dad 's brothers did . " I looked up , startled by a thought . " I just remembered , one of my aunts told me Tommy 's first wife was an abused child , she 'd been raped by her uncle ... her uncle , by God ! " " Did Tommy rape you ? " Julie asked quietly . " Nobody ever raped me . Actually , Tommy was a diabetic ; he may have been impotent as an older man . He had two wives but no children , that I know . But he must have gone for me , every time I spent the night at Grandma 's while he was living there . Every time . " I flashed on the menacing presence I had sensed leaning above me on the couch , that first day Little Pam had read to me from her diary , and gagged with claustrophobia , though what he might have done to me then I could n't begin to guess . " Except , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year before this one . He might not have been living there that year . " Julie nodded alertly . " You kept the fifth-grade diary . " " No , not for years . He died of.something to do with the diabetes . He did n't take care of himself at alive ? " " No , not for years . He died of something to do with the diabetes . He did n't take care of himself at all . " My exhaustion was by now so extreme that Julie quelled her curiosity with a visible act of will and pushed back her chair . " We can go over it some more tomorrow . You need to get to bed . Just one last thing I 'm not clear about , " she could n't help adding . " Your uncle abused you sexually , that now seems clear . You hated going to the place where he had access to you . Yet you speak of him without anger , almost with compassion . The anger and fear are all directed at your mother . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , " I replied at once ; and for the first time in all my years of off-again on-again therapy with Julie I broke down in her presence , or at least her videopresence ; I started to cry . Julie had witnessed my exchange with Little Pam on the subject of crying of course ; but that was the bradshaw . This was the two of us , therapist and patient , and she tried not to appear to gloat as the tough nut cracked at long last before her eyes . As for me , I was past caring . " Tommy was an ignorant simp . He used me but he did n't mean me any harm , he did n't know I 'd be damaged , I 'd lay odds he was Granddaddy Edgar 's sex toy as a kid-maybe all those kids were , nobody in Dad 's family knew a boundary from a turnip . But Mom loved me , and I loved her . She really loved me , and she betrayed me over and over and over . With Tommy the stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with Mom- " I broke off , sobbing like a baby . " Take your time , " said Julie , kindly if avidly . " Mom knew I did n't want to sleep over at Grandma 's , " I said when I could talk , " but she made me go . She did n't care why I did n't want to , she only cared about not offending Grandma by letting me stay both nights at Granny 's house . We 'd all three get in the taxi and drive over there , and we 'd have dinner , and then Mom and Dad would get back in another taxi and go back to Granny 's in the dark , and leave me behind . And pick me up for church the next morning . " By now I was bawling again . " And you do n't blame your father for allowing this to happen . " I mopped my face with a handful of tissues and blew my nose . " Whew . No . Well , yes - but not in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there or not . Mom was the one who cared about preserving appearances - and , to be fair , about not hurting Grandma 's feelings . " " But your feelings did n't matter . " " No , " I said , and in spite of everything I still felt surprise at this sign that somebody-Julie-thought they did . " Dad did n't stop her , true , but if I 'd appealed to him ... I just hit on this : if I 'd pleaded with him to stick up for me , if I 'd told him how much I did n't want to go , he might very well have intervened with Mom . " " But you did n't . " " It never , ever occurred to me . Like it never occurred to me to sit with him in church that time . On some level of my childhood , he just did n't exist . " 28 The next morning I called in sick . Then I called Julie and put her off till after the weekend . Felled like a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the living-room couch in my pajamas and bathrobe , the tattered Dutch girl quilt tucked round me . I turned off the phone , kept the blinds closed , ignored the mail , and generally treated the reaction I was having like a bad case of flu , rousing myself only to feed the robins their disgusting lumps of dogfood . I 'd been napping , I guess , when the doorbell woke me . I glanced at the clock : nearly midnight . Whoever was out there must be on urgent business , but I simply did n't care . Another long brmingt sounded , and another , while I lay in my apathy , wishing the importunate caller away . Instead , brief silence was followed by the scrabbling of a key in the lock ; and , before I could bestir myself enough to rise from my bed of misery and confront the intruder , a stumpy figure in a hooded cloak had slipped inside and closed the door . " Hello , my dear , hello . No , no , do n't get up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't ; I sat up and reached above my head to switch on a lamp . And there , of course , was Humphrey , his gray visage bristling and peering out of the draped maroon folds of his cavernous hood . He made a hilarious sight , but I was n't in a laughing mood . " You look exactly like one of Tolkien 's dwarves in that getup . What brings you here at this hour ? " Or at all , I might have asked , since as far as I knew he should have been in Santa Barbara . " I am traveling incognito . " ( This did make me grin in spite of everything . ) Throwing back the hood , he shrugged off his cloak and stepped over it to straddle the Hefn chair I kept around the house for him . " Did I not say I would stay in touch ? And has your phone not been turned off all day ? I was not speaking idly , Pam Pruitt . There are things I must now tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible , but the main thing Humphrey had to tell me made me feel worse than I did already . It turns out that my mother had n't sacrificed and saved to buy me my bradshaw . The bradshaw represented no vote of confidence from beyond the grave , because Mom had n't given it to me at all . He had . " I always found it do you say hard to swallow that a mathematical gift like yours , so powerful , so elegant , could be only a mere means of escaping a painful situation . I did not believe that such a gift could simply be discarded , when escape was no longer required , " he explained , all unawares , while I clutched the quilt tight around me , blindsided by this new grief . " When we began to market the bradshaws , it came to my attention that a bradshaw , used effectively , could restore power to people who had for various reasons of trauma lost their power . And the more attention I paid , the more it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of this lost power was not unlike your own . " But I saw also difficulties . The frontal attack was not a way to success . Nor could the customer be coerced . In every instance , the lost power returned incidentally , a byproduct of a freely chosen confrontation with the source of trauma . Unhappily I was forced to conclude that to press a bradshaw upon you and urge you to use it , in a deliberate attempt to regain what you had lost , must result in failure . " As far as I knew , this was more by a good deal than human psychologists had figured out about bradshaws . While most of my mind remained stunned , some small piece registered Humphrey 's summary , aware of how much it would mean to Julie . " I schemed therefore , I plotted . The Bureau needed you back . The work needed you back . I needed you , most urgently . " His wide flat eyes gleamed and his oddly jointed arms made stabbing gestures in the air ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with himself . " There were other reasons why I could not openly , directly , as myself , make a bradshaw available to an employee of the Bureau of Temporal Physics - you understand ? - but when Frances Pruitt became ill I saw an opportunity . I obtained a copy of her will , and I altered it . " I felt a stab of hope . " Did Mom provide you with the copy of her will ? Did she know what you were up to ? " " No no no , indeed not , my dear , she knew nothing . I never spoke with her of this . But when she died , I acted . I substituted the altered will for the genuine one , and supplied a voucher for the bradshaw . There was then nothing more to be done , but to hope that you would use the bradshaw soon , and that using it would restore your gift . " Humphrey crowed on about the excellent chance that remembering what Tommy did had indeed unblocked my intuition , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat hunched in the semidarkness , so angry I did n't trust myself to speak . Telling him how I felt would have been pointless ; the delicate crime he 'd perpetrated , by raising false hopes about my mother 's faith in me , is n't the sort of thing a Hefn understands . By his own lights he had done well ; and I think I realized even then that false hopes were part of what had empowered me to work past the obstacles and tolerate the terrors of running the bradshaw . But if I refrained from remonstrating , still it was impossible to forgive Humphrey , that evening , for his stupendous presumption . I refused to let him test me then and there ; and after he 'd swirled the wizard 's cloak around himself and stumped upstairs , to work at my computer complex till morning , I had no heart to put myself properly to bed . I fell on my side , pulled the quilt up under my chin , and went back to sleep where I lay . 29 WO DAYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ormelius , Head of the United Nations , met with Alfrey and Pomfrey at Thingvellir , the Hefn base in Washington DC . Miguel declared that he could no longer in good conscience counsel the Catholic countries to patience and restraint . Ormelius wasted no time making threats he could n't carry out ; he simply told the aliens that U.N . forces were inadequate to deal with widespread social chaos of the type we were beginning to see , and pleaded with them to lift the Baby Ban , as the sole means of avoiding a complete breakdown of international order . The Hefn acknowledged the realities of the world situation by agreeing that on New Year 's Day 2038 , a little more than six months from that day , they would either present humanity with a final plan for keeping its numbers within bounds - or return to the moon and the ship and depart , leaving Earth to her fate . 30 The next evening I called Liam to discuss the BTP 's redefined situation . The Hefn and their human collaborators now had just about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering the workable population-control strategy that had so far eluded us . The months ahead would be filled with very hard work . We all understood that everything was at stake ; we had to find some model in the past with power to instruct and inspire the future , if human beings were to have a future on Earth at all . No one at the Bureau of Temporal Physics was despairing ; the urgency of the situation only made them all the more determined . That was how I felt myself . Probably it was how the scientists on the Manhattan Project felt , and the ones at NASA before the first moon shot . Deadline pressure had already had a terrifically energizing effect on Liam . My call found him in top form , bursting with resolve and fresh ideas . He 'd made plans to leave in a few days for the Four Comers region , on the powerful hunch that if we could discover exactly why the Anasazi people had abandoned the Mesa Verde area and migrated south , that information might shed some useful light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the really popular mysteries must have been cleared up years ago . " You mean we still do n't know what happened to the Anasazi . What have the anthropologists been doing with themselves all these years ? " " Nobody ever went down there with a transceiver to find out . They 've got about fifteen different competing theories about what happened , and turns out they all feel like it would be cheating not to figure it out from potsherds and tree-rings . " I shook my head at this interesting example of human behavior . " I thought we were supposed to call them Hivasu or something now . The Anasazi . " Liam grinned . " Hisatsinom . Not at present . What have you been doing with yourself , all that time in Utah ? Anasazi is the Navajo word for ancient enemies , " but the Anasazi are ancestral to the modem Pueblos . It 's political , it goes back and forth . This week it 's correct to say Anasazi . Did you just call up to chat , or have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my " breakthrough . " Even in the midst of his planning Liam had enough surplus energy to find the story fascinating , and was quick to claim credit for the part he 'd played : " Did n't I tell you you and the kid should work together ? " " You did . You were right , O Genius . Thank God you stayed and shot that second bradshaw . " A look passed between us , establishing that Liam was by this time actually glad he 'd given in , but was n't going to come right out and say so . Instead he said , " You 're better off knowing , then ? " " Yes , technically I 'm sure I 'm better off , and Julie thinks so too . I ca n't honestly say I feel better yet , but I think I will eventually . " " Yeah , well , that 's an article of faith with Julie . Ironic , is n't it ? Your mom leaves you the bradshaw , and here it turns out that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Ironic indeed . " I thought how this result would have infuriated her , how angrily she would have defended against it , and felt a wrench of grief like a muscle cramp . Liam , alert and sensitive today , said at once , " Funny how the personal life always perks right along regardless , whether or not the world 's going to hell . " " You 've noticed that too , eh ? " " Have I ever . " He paused . " So things are pretty good ? Speaking personally . " " I 'd say , " I said carefully , " speaking personally , that things are better than might be expected , but that all this will take some getting used to . How are things in Santa Barbara ? How 's Eddie ? " " Eddie 's okay . Listen , I should have told you first thing- Humphrey showed up here this morning . " " I know , I talked to him . " " He 's calling a general meeting out here , did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to come out . Are the dates on the calendar yet ? " " Not the exact dates . Whenever Jeffrey and Godfrey come out of hibernation - couple of weeks , something like that . We 're supposed to be prepared to drop everything when the word comes down . I 'll be back from New Mexico by then , processing my data like mad to get it ready in time to present . " " And I 'll be up to traveling by then . Let me know if you want some help with the data . " " Thanks , I might at that . What did you mean , " up to traveling by then ? " I felt a wicked smile spread across my face , the first in a long , long time . " I 've scheduled some elective surgery . Nothing to be concerned about , just something I should have taken care of a long time ago . And do n't ask , " I said as he opened his mouth to do so , " I want to surprise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a far more amazing , more wonderful surprise to spring- purchased at a brutally high price , but none the less wonderful in the end for that . Liam , however , looked smug . " You 're getting a cosmetic remake as a Hefn . I knew it would come to this eventually . " And when I only grinned , refusing to take the bait - and when he sensed I was about to break the connection - he forestalled me by saying quickly , " So , uh , how 's avian life perking along in a world gripped in crisis ? How 's Gimpy ? " I was being manipulated , but this time I did n't mind . " Gimpy , my lad , is the greatest success in my entire career as a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Rehabilitation Permit sub-permittee . I told you her foot opened up and her eye was better ? Well , just in the past two days she started eating by herself - and whole pieces of dogfood , so her beak must have healed up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Broken , I guess . Sprained ? The upper and lower halves did n't meet right . Anyway , that 's not all . Her broken wing had healed too , she 'd started flying a little , but just low to the ground . Well , because of all the cats I 'd been making the other robins sleep in the apricot tree - " " How do you make a bird sleep in a tree ? " " You grab it and throw it up in the air as hard as you can , right at dusk . It 'll come down in a tree and stay there . Anyway . Gimpy could n't fly or perch , so she 'd been spending the night on the back of a folded lawn chair . Then yesterday afternoon she went missing . " " And you went looking for a corpus delecti . " " I did . But I finally found her next door , way up in a big lilac bush . She looked like she 'd climbed up there using both wings and both feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and I figured if she could do that , maybe she could perch on a tree limb . So last night I stuck her up in the apricot tree , to see what would happen . And she held on ! She spent the whole night up there , and flew down out of it this morning when I went out to serve breakfast , looking for all the world like a normal bird . Well , a normal bird who 'd been through a truly terrible experience . " I laughed ; I was extremely happy about Gimpy 's recovery . " And she gobbled up her dog food , and I have n't seen her since . I think maybe she 's taken off . Two of the others have . She finally got over her cold . " When I concluded my tale with an enormous yawn , Liam relented and said goodnight and see you soon . I repeated my offer to help analyze Anasazi data if time were tight , and hung up . What I 'd refrained from saying-though he would know soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next frenetic months in exile in Salt Lake City . After flying out to Santa Barbara for Humphrey 's meeting , I 'd be staying for the duration . Still wiped out from the upheavals of the past few days , I told the phone not to bother me till further notice and went straight to bed . No sooner had I burrowed under the covers and doused the light than I was out cold ; and almost that soon the kaleidoscope of fractal dreams began to revolve , transmigrating one pattern into the next , just as it had each night since the night of Humphrey 's midnight visit . Pure fractals were all it showed me . I did n't dream about my relatives at all . " - for Shayne Bell
