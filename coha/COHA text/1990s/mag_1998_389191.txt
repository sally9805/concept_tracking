Section : World report How the FBI unraveled the Africa embassy bombings <p> Special Agent Sheila Horan 's flight had just landed in Rota , Spain , for a quick refueling . As Horan strolled into a forward cargo hold to stretch her legs , she saw smoke . " Out ! " she yelled to her team of FBI agents and rescue specialists . " Get out of the plane ! " No one was hurt , but it took mechanics 12 hours to fix the faulty valve that had routed engine exhaust into the cabin . Horan 's government KC-135 arrived in Nairobi , Kenya , at 3 a.m. on August 9 , a long 41 hours after the bombings of U.S. embassies there and in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania . <p> It was an inauspicious beginning for what would become the FBI 's largest overseas investigation  --  and for Horan , head of counterterrorism at the FBI 's Washington field office and the first woman to run an operation of this size . Within days , 375 FBI agents and crime experts would pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phones that did n't work , and myriad obstacles of distance , culture , and logistics , that investigation is now widely judged a success . Osama bin Laden , an exiled Saudi millionaire , was indicted this month with five of his associates , based largely on the work of the FBI and its partners in Africa . Among the highlights : The key to cracking the case came , as in many investigations , with a lucky break . A man arrested a thousand miles away with a phony passport identified many of the bombers and tied them to bin Laden , who prosecutors say masterminded the attacks . The FBI has determined that the bombs used against both embassies were big , crude devices that packed as much as 2,000 pounds of TNT into each charge . Blasting caps and plastic explosives were used as detonators ; other parts gave the bombs a Middle Eastern signature . The trail that provided money for the bombings led through accounts at a Saudi-backed bank in Dar es Salaam and through Islamic charities in Nairobi . But investigators have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only shards of metal and an ID plate , the FBI traced the bomb vehicle in Tanzania back to its manufacturer in Japan , then through at least five owners to one of the bombers . <p> U.S. News has interviewed Horan and her deputy , Kenneth Piernick , at length . The agents took pains not to comment on the results of what is a continuing investigation ; but their interviews , along with those of African police and U.S. justice and intelligence officials , provided fresh glimpses into how the case of the embassy bombings was solved . <p> In those first August days after the bombings , the FBI flooded East Africa with its best people : From Washington , D.C. , came bomb experts and lab technicians . From Pocatello , Idaho , came computer specialists trained in logging and analyzing data . From New York came counterterrorism agents who for two years had followed Osama bin Laden . The bureau also brought to the scene a lesson it had learned in Saudi Arabia . There , investigating the bombing of the Khobar Towers , agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended in frustration . Here , Horan hoped the bureau would fare better with local police . <p> In Kenya , Peter Mbuvi was the man the FBI needed . As deputy director of Kenya 's Criminal Investigative Division , Mbuvi , a man of infectious enthusiasm , knew his country 's criminal side intimately . But he knew the FBI only by reputation and worried how the Americans would view his CID . " They expected a developing country , maybe an inferior police force , " he said . Mbuvi was determined to prove them wrong . His CID agents paired up with FBI agents , running raids and interrogation sessions together . He even gave the FBI space for its command post : a half-dozen utility tables thrown together in a spartan police conference room . <p> While FBI-CID teams fanned out across the city , Mbuvi 's men had set up a hot line . From it came leads of all sorts : Some callers claimed to know the killers but , agents discovered , actually only wanted a free ticket to America , courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested police check out a suspicious fellow named Rashed Daoud al Owhali . When the CID found him , his face and hands were covered with cuts , and a large wound ran down his back . He claimed he was an innocent victim of the blast . <p> In Tanzania , where FBI agents also teamed up well with locals , differences quickly emerged . One Tanzanian commander told his FBI counterpart that American interrogators were simply too polite . " In our country , that is a disadvantage , " he explained . " Our people understand force . . . . Now we 're going to be a little more direct . " But as in Nairobi , the Americans gained a growing respect for their partners . " They continually found evidence we overlooked , " says Piernick . <p> In Dar es Salaam , Piernick found , the evidence even grew on trees . Visiting the bomb site , he was standing in the shade when a breeze jarred something loose from a branch above him . He looked down to find a piece of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who found the nearby trees littered with body parts , car pieces , and other potential evidence  --  blown there by the force of the bomb . Local cops had puzzled over the FBI 's grisly work at collecting human remains ; an agent finally showed them a portable X-ray machine the bureau had brought to examine pieces of flesh for bomb fragments . At the Nairobi morgue , victims ' bodies were cut apart in the search for bomb components . <p> Big and crude . Eventually , from the rubble and elsewhere , 3 tons of materials were packed up , sealed , and shipped to the bureau 's crime labs back home to be analyzed . Bomb experts , meanwhile , used computer models to reconstruct the blast . Their conclusions : The crude bombs that devastated the U.S. embassies each contained some 2,000 pounds of TNT . Investigators found blasting caps and traces of RDX  --  a plastic explosive  --  that were used as detonators . They also found bits of cylindrical tanks that held oxygen and acetylene , commonly used by Mideast terrorists with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explosive residue were later found at the home of Rashid Saleh Hemed , one of the suspects held by Tanzanian authorities . <p> At the bomb sites , agents combed the rubble for auto parts  --  looking especially for the VIN , or vehicle identification number , of the delivery vehicles . In Dar es Salaam , the FBI found the terrorists had welded their bomb to the chassis of a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigeration truck , which investigators painstakingly reconstructed . Agents tracked the VIN back to Nissan in Japan , and then followed a trail of ownership that ran from a Japanese dealership to the truck 's first owner , and then to the exporter who shipped the used vehicle to Tanzania . The path led to a local importer , then to the broker who peddled the truck , and , eventually , to one of the bombers . Still , despite their progress , investigators needed a big break . It came from an unexpected place . <p> On the day of the bombings , a slight , cleanshaven fellow named Mohammed Sadeek Odeh arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration officer noted that Odeh looked nothing like the photo in his Yemeni passport , which showed a bearded , heavy-set man . Odeh had just come from Nairobi and was bound for Afghanistan . <p> For three days , unknown to Americans , Pakistani security officers interrogated Odeh . He later claimed he was coerced into confessing a key role in the bombings , but Pakistani officials say he boasted of his feat to them . By week 's end , a team of CIA and FBI agents were secretly escorting Odeh back to Nairobi . <p> " We were very hopeful , but guarded , " says Horan . " These kinds of things happen and then do n't pan out . " Indeed , on his return to Kenya , Odeh stonewalled his interrogators . Two days later , confronted with evidence found in his Kenyan home , he broke . <p> Bomb building . From Odeh 's mouth , investigators say , spilled details of the Nairobi bomb plot : how he and others had cased the area before the blast , where they built the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack . He even offered up names : Owhali , the suspect whom the CID picked up that first week , his body covered with cuts ; the driver , Azzam , who had likely perished in the attack ; Fazul Mohammed , an explosives expert ; and others Odeh had only met at the airport . Two of the bomb makers , he said , already had escaped to Afghanistan : Mohammed Saleh , a Sudanese , and Abdullah , a Saudi . Best of all , he named the group responsible , Al Qaeda , and its leader  --  Osama bin Laden . <p> Within hours , agents were knocking on doors , raiding sites , and grabbing documents . An FBI-CID team pushed its way into the Hilltop Hotel , a $10-a-night lodge in a seedy Nairobi neighborhood , where Odeh and others planned the attack . Odeh 's tips also led them to a steel-gated villa in an exclusive part of town , which had once been rented by Fazul Mohammed ; inside , they found explosives residue everywhere . <p> Under pressure , Owhali also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week before the attack , he had traveled from Pakistan to Kenya , scouted the embassy , and rode in the bomb vehicle , expecting to die in the blast . But Owhali left the truck to throw a grenade at a guard stationed outside , he said , and then fled . <p> At the FBI 's makeshift command center , the excitement rose . Agents burst into the command center after interrogations , shouting about what leads to follow . " We are getting close to our aim , " Mbuvi told Horan . " We are breaking through . " <p> Other agents began to follow the trail of money to the bombers . Funds were traced through bank accounts at the Saudi-backed Greenland Bank in Dar es Salaam and through Islamic service organizations in Nairobi . Kenyan officials shut down five of the groups , and a FBI-CID team hauled away documents from one , Mercy Relief International . But following the funds has not proved easy . " We know where they sent the money , " said one agent . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the paper trail the bombers left behind . Officials in East Africa were sticklers for bureaucracy , and their records were voluminous . Telephone bills , vehicle registrations , entry-exit records  --  all proved useful in tracking the terrorists . From the Hilltop Hotel , investigators traced a call from the bombers to the Comoros Islands , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean . Horan 's agents worked with local police there to track Mohammed , the explosives expert fingered by Odeh . The agents apparently had just missed him . Two days after the FBI 's query , investigators believe he slipped out of the islands to Dubai and disappeared . But at his home , agents found incriminating letters and computer disks tying him to al Qaeda and a U.S. citizen named Wadih el Hage . Ostensibly a tire repairman in Arlington , Texas , officials say , Hage had served as a top bin Laden aide during the early 1990s and was tied to terrorists who had bombed the World Trade Center and killed 18 U.S. soldiers in Somalia . <p> U.S. intelligence already had linked bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. military trainers in Saudi Arabia and the murder of dozens of tourists in Egypt . Two months before the embassy attacks , a federal grand jury in New York had secretly indicted the Saudi exile for his role in Somalia . Now , with growing evidence from Africa , U.S. officials expanded their assault on bin Laden 's organization , sparking arrests in at least six countries . Prosecutors in New York filed criminal complaints against Odeh , Owhali , and Mohammed . Then , two weeks ago , in a sweeping indictment , the Justice Department added their names to those of bin Laden , Hage , and another top aide , charging the entire group with conspiracy to commit murder in the embassy bombings . <p> Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan , protected by the fundamentalist Taliban militia . But those pursuing the man believe he can not hide forever . If he is captured and brought to trial , the evidence found in the rubble of East Africa may yet prove his undoing . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Bomb squad .
