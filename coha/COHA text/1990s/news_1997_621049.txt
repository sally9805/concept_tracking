<p> Eco-entrepreneur Doug Tompkins is losing ownership of Chile 's largest private nature preserve just the way he wants : The Chileans have begun to accept it as his gift . On July 4 , after two years of acrimony and stalemate  --  seven years after he began the spending that would bring his 800,000-acre Parque Pumalin project to life  --  Tompkins and the Chilean government inked an accord that allows the vast project to move toward completion . <p> Bay Area residents are used to seeing sparks fly from the path of this highly motivated high-school dropout . In 1965 , at age 22 , Tompkins founded an outdoor gear-and-garment company here , The North Face . Then , he and then-wife Susie developed her small dress company , Plain Jane , into the casual-wear behemoth known as Esprit Corp . At its pinnacle , in the mid-1980s , this clothing empire grossed $ 800 million annually . But Tompkins refused to lose himself in business . Half of each of year was devoted to climbing , kayaking and other wilderness adventures . The vision gained led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He and Susie parted company both as business partners and as a couple in 1990 . Then , with ample fiscal fuel gained by selling his half of Esprit , Tompkins flew south . In Chile , now using his business skills for environmental goals , he built a network of holdings in the rugged region south of Puerto Montt , and formed a Chilean foundation to be the ultimate receiver . More than 670,000 acres are now in the park ; Tompkins eventually plans to commit all 800,000 acres of his holdings to it . He has invested more than $ 14 million of his own in the project , and $ 2 million from other donors . <p> Yet economic clout by itself did not ensure success . Tompkins faced fierce opposition from Chilean nationalists and industrialists . They were suspicious of a foreigner owning a huge swath that bisected the nation , and feared encouraging Chile 's fledgling environmental movement . In any event , the sheer nastiness of a smear campaign leveled against Tompkins is the stuff of legend . <p> However , after study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past all the calumny and deemed the project worthy . It 's now likely Parque Pumalin will succeed . A natural zone 200 square miles larger than Rhode Island , featuring snowy Andean peaks , dense virgin forest and pristine fjords will endure as a nature preserve , where pudu can scamper and puma prowl , and human enterprise shall be subordinated to the general health of this landscape . Tompkins spoke to The Chronicle during a visit with friends and family in San Francisco . <p> Q : Last year , you were hanging tough , saying if you saw no progress on the Pumalin project , you 'd deny access to the land . What finally broke the logjam on park approval ? <p> A : Well , polemic against the project had a life its own . We spent most of our time defending ourselves . I think President Frei and his chief of staff , Juan Villarzu , saw this was an issue that had to get sorted out . Villarzu 's a level-headed , square-shooting guy . After some study , he saw the project was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it had been blown so out of proportion . I credit our U.S. ambassador to Chile , Gabrielle Guerra Mondragon , for opening the dialogue . <p> The agreement we signed is a protocol , not a binding document . But it spells out the necessary cooperations . It makes the government comfortable , and helps push this project along . <p> . <p> Q : Any behind-the-scenes arm- twisting or concessions required ? <p> A : No . Actually , we had zero discussions with Chilean industry . The government may have talked to them , and tried to calm apprehensions . Some news reports said there were concessions made as to roads , power lines , mines and so forth . But their government has always possessed the power of eminent domain for such things . They also have an Environmental Impact Study process to mitigate the bad effects . <p> They have a highway-and-ferry link down the coast they 've wanted to complete for years . Any power lines would likely run along it , for easy servicing . A new mining study of the area found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of that . And as far as timber harvest , there wo n't be any activity in this area at all . That 's out of the question . <p> . <p> Q : So , what kind of reaction are you getting from the Chilean people and press now ? <p> A : Really good . It 's been 90 percent positive . There 's still complaints from a few dissenters , and politicians who must satisfy powerful constituents . And opposition party members always feel they have to hammer the government . Plenty of people just want to wait and see . <p> A poll was done in Chile last June . It found that 30 percent of the respondents who knew of the project thought it was a good idea , and another 30 percent figured it was probably OK . About 33 percent had a bad opinion . That indicated a great shift ! Back when we were getting hammered by bad press all the time , " good " and " OK " together would have equaled only about 20 percent , at best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmentalists and students who were for us in a very strong way . <p> But now , I think you 'll see the people with a bad opinion move into the middle , and the people in the middle get positive . The fact that the government investigated us thoroughly  --  for instance , we underwent a huge tax investigation  --  and came out in favor should gradually swing more fence-sitters over to a positive view . <p> . <p> Q : To what degree will natural systems be preserved in this park ? <p> A : All ecosystems will be held intact . There 's no talk about doing anything other than that . The only question will be how many trails should we put in . For those , we 'll probably stick to the sites that people can access easily by boat and road . There 's some access through valleys other than the park land . The thing visitors wo n't be able to do is branch off the trails and whack their way around with machetes . Climbers who want to reach peaks in the backcountry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parks . I do n't want to see anything natural get hurt . But I wo n't be around forever , so it will be up to the future park directors to ensure that everything gets held to the straight and narrow by environmental impact studies . <p> . <p> Q : How does it feel to win this success after working and fighting for it over the past seven years ? <p> A : It 's a step in the right direction . It does n't mean it all will run smoothly from now on . I 'd say another eight years of serious work lie ahead . The best change is that we used to spend half our time fending off attacks of all kinds  --  tricks , threats and criticism . Now , we can concentrate 98 percent of our time on working on the park . That feels pretty good . <p> We achieved a little bit of a blow for the environment . A drop in the bucket . But it 's going to take lots of drops in that bucket from a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrective force for looking after our world . <p> . <p> Q : You and Chris McDivett live out near the park , on a small organic farm with solar power , draft animals and so on , in the Renihue Valley . As the park project advances , will you continue to live there ? <p> A : Renihue will be one of the demonstration farms and information areas for the park . We want to teach the locals , the colonos , how to have prosperous subsistance farms on the land that 's adjacent to the park . And we do intend to live out there , at least until we turn our attention to other things . Whether that will be our home for the rest of our lives , I ca n't say . <p> . <p> Q : One charge leveled at you by park opponents was that you were trying to oust native Chileans ( about 250 families ) from the area . Are you saying you actually want to make it easier for them to live there ? <p> A : Nobody will live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration farms along the edges , one in each of the major watersheds , where we will try to show ways to live with appropriate technology . Here we 'll teach things like bee- keeping , and how to market the honey . Also , organic gardens , animal husbandry , knitting woolen goods and so on . <p> The idea is to encourage things that break them out of the cycle of poverty , get them over that desperate line of survival . Then they wo n't be forced by economic circumstance to invade the park in ways that run counter to the aims of the park  --  like with timber theft , which happens occasionally now . And there are jobs in the park for them ; we 're the region 's biggest employer . They 're helping us build the visitor infrastructure  --  trails , bridges , cabanas and so on  --  with local materials . <p> . <p> Q : How can Northern Californians visit and enjoy the park ? <p> A : We 've got about a dozen hiking trails in place so far , covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ancient alerce trees . There will be five visitor centers , including the main one at the ferry port of Coleta Gonzales , where we also have a campground . There are another two campgrounds at fjord sites . Many other facilities , including horse riding stables , are planned . The best way for U.S. visitors to plan a trip is to fax our foundation at Puerto Montt ( 011-566-5255-145 ) . <p> I 've climbed some of the peaks . There 's big granite walls up toward the Argentine border , but the weather 's serious and a lot of the rock is mossy and wet . The whitewater runs are short and very difficult . Reg Lake ( a noted river explorer ) and I tried a 15-mile run in Renihue and nearly got our wings clipped . <p> . <p> Q : OK , so how will you celebrate ? Are you going to Disneyland ? <p> A : I 'm short on celebrations , and long on getting to work . I 'll be at our foundation office here for the rest of this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves , and push to get ready for their summer . We want to put our best face forward for the tourists and visitors . Then we can slack up over winter , when they 're not around so much . <p> . <p> Q : What will be the next project for you in the realm of ecology of global conservation ? <p> A : I 'm not planning on getting into any other project of this type or size for a while . I 've got so much on my plate right now , I could not take on any other obligation . We will occupy ourselves with adding corners to this park as the land comes available over time . <p> Then , there 's the park endowment to get together . My part was buying the land , and after I put $ 13- $ 14 million into the infrastructure , that will put me over the top . Beyond that , we need a $ 15-$ 20 million endowment , a trust for operating funds into perpetuity . I 'm petitioning for donations from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a thousand individuals toward it right now . <p> . <p> Q : What lessons have you learned from trying to build this project ? <p> A : Well , we were clearly a little naive about the amount of political and nonpolitical opposition we would face . Nobody we talked to told us it could be like that . In my mind , I replay how we might have done some things better . We did make mistakes , misjudgments . The same thing happens in business ; you make an error in hiring , say , and you learn from it and go on . We also might have done a lot worse , I can tell you that . The main thing you have to do is try for a correction as fast as possible , and not repeat it . <p> Our main mistake was that we underestimated how much our job should be speaking clearly and dealing directly at the local political level . We should have tried to know more , going in , about the political culture . We 're getting better at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to be out of the limelight ; instead I got sucked right into it . Now I know you 've got to be ready . If your project is big , it 's automatically controversial . And that light 's going to shine on you , and you 'd better be ready to deal with it . <p> I was advised to have public relations people running things , but I do n't believe that 's a good solution over the long term . That puts a layer between you and reality . It does n't give the public a genuine impression of who you are and what you 're doing . It takes time and it 's a bit harder to deal with people directly , but then you do n't have to worry about interference from that filter . <p> And I should have taken two months of total immersion Spanish at the begining , rather than trying to pick it up as I went . So , I was not as articulate as I could have been in the Chilean media . I 'm better now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still self-conscious on TV ; if I make a mistake , I get nervous , then that vicious circle grows tighter and tighter . But in front of a small bunch of people , or friendly students , I do pretty good . Actually , I can speak to a huge group of students and stay comfortable . <p> . <p> Q : Any fresh insights on how to operate in Latin America in general , or Chile in particular ? <p> A : In the business world for years and years , I operated in some 50 different countries . Everywhere I went , people would say , hey , this country 's really different . But I kept discovering that 's not true . People all over the world are fundamentally the same . Yes , there are some cultural differences , but those are relatively minor in comparison with the main values . People like to be fair , they like to be treated with respect , they appreciate honesty and all the other things you might put on the list of good virtues . Some cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious of foreigners . But the deep soul of humanity remains the same . <p> Chile did have its idiosyncrasies , and I certainly arrived there with mine . But there are a lot of things I like and admire about Latin culture . I can identify with it . It 's not that far away from my own view of the world . <p> You know , it 's not the differences in cultures that cause problems in the world today , anyway . It 's the globalizing economy , huge corporations acting in tandem with governments . It 's the giant , technological push to proliferate a consumer society . This challenges the indigenous , agrarian cultures , and causes more disruption than anything else . <p> Our project ran into problems because it favors conservation and care for the environment , and confronts that runaway , pro-development juggernaut . Any project similar to ours would face similar opposition , whether in Africa or Australia . It 's an inevitable clash of concepts . The real name of the game is , how do you dredge through that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear on the issue ? <p> . <p> Q : What will Parque Pumalin look like , one century from now ? <p> A : Ah , that 's so far away , it 's hard to predict ! Hopefully , it will look similar to how it is today . A large , natural area , with prosperous , agrarian minicultures in the valleys , and 100 years of rebirth in forest around its edges . And a carefully managed stream of people who visit from all over . <p> One of the great aspects of this park is that it allows elements of a remarkable biodiversity to move on forward through time . Like the alerce trees . These are giant cedars , with a shaggy , fluted bark that makes them look a lot like redwoods . They occupy a similar microclimate , and they may actually live to be a few thousand years older than redwoods . Research is still being done on that . <p> Elsewhere in Chile , very few virgin alerce groves remain . The wood was too good , too useful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of groves that will stay protected . One of our trails goes right to them , so you can appreciate what they 're like . <p> . <p> Q : Do you hope this project will set an example for other people with large economic assets , showing them what they can do to influence the future ? <p> A : Well , it 's hardly the first time it 's been done . The Nature Conservancy has set up this type of thing for a long time . The important thing is to get lot of people doing this on all sorts of different scales . <p> People have to free their imaginations and realize everyone can do something , on a large or a small scale , depending on their ability . Those who can do a lot because of their position and potential should jump right in there . They will find tremendous pleasure in doing this , and discover that it 's worth every penny they spend . <p> DOUG TOMPKINS <p> * 1943 : Born in Conneaut , Ohio , on March 28 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation , and goes climbing in the Shawangunks . <p> * 1961 : Makes first trip to Chile as a skier and mountaineer . <p> * 1963 : Marries Susie Russell . <p> * 1965 : Founds The North Face outdoor company in Berkeley .
