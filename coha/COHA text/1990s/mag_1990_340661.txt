The Midwest 's best political reporter , David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register , is poised and waiting for the first 1992 Democratic presidential prospector to jet across the Mississippi into Keokuk or come stealthily by Hertz into Council Bluffs . His early-warning network , tuned to the Iowa caucuses that will kick off the next presidential season two years from now , is unerring . <P> But these days Yepsen looks out over the rolling fields greening in the spring sun and sees nothing . " Strangely quiet , " he says . Last October , Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen showed up and added his weight to a notably leaden fund raiser . A couple of months ago , Colorado 's voluble Congresswoman Pat Schroeder came around for two eminently forgettable speeches at Drake and Iowa universities . Since then nary a candidate . <P> With no bona fide contender to write about , Yepsen lobbed in a column two weeks ago on the virtues of neighboring Nebraska 's telegenic Senator Robert Kerrey . In the great political quiet , the piece created a sonic boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , is now the toast of political pundits and television interviewers . They dwell less on his vague achievements in government than on his travels , his Medal of Honor from Vietnam , his mastery of a restaurant business and the fact that he lured Hollywood 's sexy superstar Debra Winger to his bachelor quarters in Lincoln . Those credentials play well in a party that has had trouble defining its patriotism and gender . <P> But Kerrey , like other Democratic mentionables , has not formed a political- action committee to raise funds , set up an exploratory committee , hired a pollster , secretly gathered a brain trust or assembled any of the normal paraphernalia of political conquest . At a similar point in previous election cycles , John Kennedy had barnstormed the U.S. ; George McGovern , Gary Hart and Walter Mondale had functioning organizations ; and Jimmy Carter and Richard Gephardt had wandered purposefully through Iowa 's byways . <P> Jesse Jackson is out and about , of course , but he is a shooting star in search of a constellation . New Jersey 's Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Gore are all up for re-election and have pledged their loyalties to their constituencies  --  for now . So have Governors Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Mario Cuomo of New York , Senators Charles Robb of Virginia and George Mitchell of Maine , and such congressional possibilities as Schroeder , Gephardt and Speaker Tom Foley . <P> All but the most hopelessly addicted political junkies  --  and even a few of them  --  welcome the respite from the ceaseless campaigns of the past . " I 'm glad of it , " swears Democratic Chairman Ron Brown . " The American public can not take another three-year campaign . " But the main reason for the Democrats ' hesitation is not to give the electorate a break . Says election analyst Richard Scammon : " Bush is so high in the polls , ' 92 is so close , these people may have decided to pass it by . "
