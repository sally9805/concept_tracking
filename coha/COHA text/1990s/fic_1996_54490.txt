MIKE WAS SCANNING THE morning newsnet for Christmas ads , checking the competition as usual but also hoping to find a present for Sarah , when the phone rang . Sarah had been cleaning the house last night , so she had set the ringer to " air raid , " and apparently forgot to lower it again when she was done . The sudden clamor made Mike flinch hard enough to nudge his howl of cereal over the edge of the table . It hit the floor with a thump , not breaking the bowl but still spraying milk and Moonie Bits outward in a white fan of drenching destruction  --  most of which wound up in Mike 's open briefcase . <p> " Christ ! " he shouted , jumping up and upsetting his chair , which in turn upset the shelf of African violets beneath the window . One of the violets also fell into his briefcase . <p> The phone shrieked a second time . <p> He stood over his ruined briefcase  --  and the mined Bundy artwork , over which he had sweated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept and clenched his fists while the phone rang again . The morning had started so well . . . <p> " Do you want me to get it ? " Sarah asked from the bedroom . <p> Hmm . No reason why the morning could n't keep going wall , actually . All it required was the right attitude . " No , " Mike said , unclenching his hands . " No , that 's all right . I 'll get it . " Slowly , deliberately , he reached out and picked up the flatscreen from the kitchen countertop , set it upright on the table , and flicked it on . With a fiendish grin he shouted , " What do you want ? " <p> He heard an in drawn breath before the picture formed , then Greg Penzley , one of the advertising firm 's two senior partners , peered out of the phone at him with wide eyes . " Michael ? " <p> Mike grinned wider . " No , it 's the tooth fairy . Who 'd you expect , idiot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Michael , what in the world has gotten into  --  " Penzley suddenly laughed . " Oh , so that 's how it is , eh ? Well same to you , then . I 'd rather talk to the tooth fairy than your whiny little carcass . " He leaned back in his padded office chair , giving Mike a view past his bald head and rounded shoulders through the fiftieth-floor window overlooking downtown Portland . Penzley crossed his arms over his chest and said , " Your miserable attempts to come up with a new Bundy campaign are the laughingstock of the company . We 've got a betting pool here at the office on when you finally come up with something and I 've picked December 31st . Five years from now . " <p> Mike snorted . " Ha ! Well you lose , then , jerk-face . The new Bundy ads are done and sitting in a pool of spilt milk in my briefcase . " <p> Penzley laughed even louder . " Ah , so that 's it ! Well maybe you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with your washed-up career . " <p> " I think that 's just what I 'll do . " <p> " Good . Fuck you . " <p> " Fuck you too . " Mike slammed the phone screen-first onto the table , but Penzley had beat him to the switch ; his own image blanked out a fraction of a second before Michael 's screen fell . <p> " Aaarrrrggghhhhh ! " Mike 's growl was an animalistic , **27;1058;TOOLONG exhalation of pent-up fury . He picked up the phone and hurled it through the window . The glass shattered wonderfully , and Mike 's briefcase , still dripping milk and potting soil , widened the hole in the phone 's wake . <p> Sarah leaned out from the bedroom , dressed in only a light blue towel . " Hey , why do n't you make some noise while you 're at it ? " <p> Mike was breathing hard now , and grinning like an idiot . " Noise ? You want noise ? All right , I 'll give you noise ! " He grabbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor the pile of books , magazines , and newsdisks , plus their scanner and the vase full of roses he had brought home for Sarah last night . The reading material merely thumped , but the vase hit the edge of a chair and shattered with a satisfying crunch , and the floor shook when the table struck it . Mike shoved it on over into the Christmas tree , which went down in a shower of tinkling ornaments . <p> Sarah applauded . " Feel better now ? " <p> " Yeah . " Mike straightened , laughed , and stepped toward her , but his foot caught one of the shards of vase . <p> " Ow ! " He raised his foot and pulled out a long sliver of glass . Blood dripped to the carpet . " Oh , son of a bitch that hurts . " <p> Sarah winced in sympathetic agony . " Fun 's over . " <p> " Yeah . Guess so . " He limped down the hallway into the spare bedroom , where they kept the backspacer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't go back too far , okay ? " she said , batting her eyelashes and leaning out for a kiss as he passed . <p> He blushed . " I wo n't . " He gave her a quick kiss  --  his foot hurt too much to put any real feeling into it  --  stepped into the closet-sized booth in the spare bedroom , set the single dial in the waist-high control panel for twenty minutes , and said , " See you in another life , sexy . " <p> Sarah nodded . " Bye . " <p> He closed the door and pushed the " go " button . <p> The shower was still running when he opened the door again . He heard Sarah and himself giggling softly as they made love and thought briefly about joining them for a quick threesome , but the morning had really been going just about perfect without modification . Besides , his foot hurt like hell . Better just take care of business and get it over with . <p> He padded down the hallway , then stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hard to clean up as the cereal would . Shrugging , he went on into the kitchen , grabbed a wad of paper towels , and padded back to the backspacer . He wrapped the paper towels around his foot , set the timer for five minutes further back , and pushed " go " again . <p> The shower was just starting up when he opened the door . The floor was clean . Mike hobbled into the living room , set the telephone ringer to " gentle , " and turned back toward the backspacer , but as usual when he 'd made a change that created a paradox , he did n't have to climb all the way back in and push the " return " button . The universe , ever tidy in such matters , took care of that for him . He did n't feel a thing when it edited him out of existence . <p> The phone rang while Mike was reading the morning newsnet for Christmas ads . He laid down the scanner , took a bite of cereal , and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propping it up on the table , he swallowed and switched it on after the third ring . " Wilson residence . " <p> " Michael ? Penzley here . Just calling to confirm that you 've got the new Bundy ads ready for us today . " <p> Michael looked over to his briefcase lying on the floor beside the table . Hmmm , that bowl of cereal looked awfully close to the edge . He nudged it farther inward while he said , " No problem , sir . They 're sitting in my briefcase , ready to go . " <p> " Good . I knew we could count on you . See you at nine . " <p> " See you then . " Mike switched off the phone and turned back to the newsscreen . Nine o'clock . That left him just under an hour to find a present for Sarah before he went to the office . Plenty of time , if he just knew what to buy her . That was always the rob , though , was n't it ? When he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Oh , I already have everything I want , " which was very flattering but no help at all . After Christmas , of course , she would go out and buy whatever it was she 'd been hoping for all along , but she never told him what it was ahead of time . No , she evidently thought it was his job to figure that out on his own . <p> He did n't have to get a present this morning , of course . He still had this evening , and two more shopping days left after that before Christmas . He just wanted to get it taken care of early , so he could relax about it and concentrate on the last-minute ads for this afternoon 's and tomorrow 's electronic newsnet editions . The agency was swamped with clients this year , all of whom claimed that sales were way down and who wanted Mike and his co-workers to design completely new ad campaigns for them overnight . <p> Mike recognized the irony in an advertising art director who did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hype he spread about his clients ' products , he had n't yet found anything that Sarah might want . <p> He considered asking one of the women at the office what they thought , but he did n't want to resort to that . A present was supposed to be from the giver , not from his co-workers . And besides , they were all advertisers . They would just try to push their own product lines on him . <p> Sarah stepped into the dining room with just a fluffy blue towel wrapped around her body . Her red hair dripped water from the ends , and a few drops landed on Mike 's briefcase as she bent over to kiss him on the cheek . He glanced down to see if she 'd hit the artwork , but she 'd just missed it , so he nudged the briefcase aside with his toe and kissed her more enthusiastically , inhaling the aroma of soap and fresh-washed skin that he loved so much in the mornings . He slipped a hand under the towel , and she giggled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you start that again . " <p> " I could always loop back , " he said , tugging playfully on the towel . <p> " And I could invite the neighbors in to watch , " she said , backing away and re-wrapping herself in the towel . <p> It was an old argument , reduced by now to those two lines . Sarah saw no point in doing something that would obviously be edited out when the people involved backspaced into their normal lives , while Mike felt that any pleasant experience was worth exploring , no matter how illusory it might turn out to be . It was n't just an argument over fooling around , either . The fallout from their different philosophies spread through their entire marriage . Sarah did n't like going to movies that might gross her out or bore her , while Mike felt that he should try everything that came along , and just edit out later the ones he thought were a waste of time . Sarah did n't like experimenting with food , while Mike would eat practically anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried that once or twice , but if so then he 'd definitely backspaced over the experience because he did n't remember it . <p> That was Sarah 's point . If you did n't remember it , if in the final version of reality you had never even done it , then why bother to do it in the first place ? <p> And Mike 's answer was always " Why not ? " Lots of people did invite the neighbors over for orgies . Mike had heard of stranger things than that , too ; murder mystery parties with authentic murders , religious mass-suicides that were undone when the day of judgment failed to arrive , even full-scale wars between nations had apparently been fought to find out what concessions to make at the bargaining table before hostilities began for real . Mike suspected he had volunteered to fight in at least one such war , and though he had no evidence to prove it , the thrill of knowing he would have done it was still his . <p> But not Sarah 's . If she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence she did n't waste her time  --  even imaginary time  --  on things that would n't remain real . <p> It was possible to loop around and not create paradoxes , but to do that you had to make sure you did n't meet yourself or change anything you or anyone else would have done , and unfortunately this was n't one of those situations . <p> " Poor baby , " Sarah said . She kissed him on the cheek before she turned away toward the bedroom again to get dressed . " Do n't forget your umbrella , " she reminded him as she walked down the hallway . " It 's going to rain this afternoon . " Her implication was clear ; she did n't want him backspacing for something that trivial . <p> He looked out the window at the city skyline beyond , and felt a brief impulse to pick up the phone and throw it right through the glass . That would be reason enough to backspace , he supposed , but he knew what happened to people who gave in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was n't free ; eventually the poor buggers had to accept whatever life they wound up with and damn their rotten luck . No , Sarah was perhaps overcautious , but she did have a point . <p> THERE WERE THREE murders on the subway , and a bombing that took out half the station just as Mike 's train pulled in . The murderers were simply edited out before they got on the train , but in order to keep as much evidence as possible the police apprehended the bomber only moments before he set off the explosive , so Mike got to watch them lead him away in handcuffs . He was a normal-enough looking high-school kid , maybe early college age , dressed in a Santa suit to hide the dynamite taped to his waist , and he was grinning as he explained to the police how he 'd built the detonator from paperclips and an old chemical battery . " I just wanted to see if it 'd work , " he told them . " I guess it must have , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops said . He wore the puzzled look of someone trying to see through a paradox , but he finally just shrugged and said , " I do n't usually get wild hunches like the one that made me check you for explosives without a pretty good reason . " <p> The kid nodded , a slow frown replacing his own grin . " Why did n't you go back and stop me from building it ? " he asked . <p> " Got to have a deterrent , " another cop said . " You could have killed people . Probably did . If we let everybody do that whenever they wanted without fining them , we 'd be so busy backspacing we 'd never get past this afternoon . " <p> " So what 's the fine , anyway ? " <p> They passed out of sight and hearing before Mike could learn the kid 's punishment . It was pretty steep , he knew . A public backspace affected thousands of people , and though nobody had proved that it was any tougher to rebuild an entire city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sarah hated the thought of having the job forced on them , even if they did n't know it had happened . <p> Mike did n't care , particularly , though it did bother him just a little that he had probably died in the explosion . The kid had just been goofing around , sure , and the police had fixed it all before the fact , but it was still pretty bad manners to kill people without their permission . <p> He browsed the jewelry and knick-knack shops on his way toward the elevator , but his mind was n't really on it and he saw nothing that screamed out " Sarah ! " to him . Hmm . Well , then , he would try again this evening . He had plenty of time . <p> J.P . Bundy was a wiry , frenetic , balding man who had no doubt been called a yuppie back when he was young and the term had been coined . He 'd made a fortune selling men 's cotton briefs at a nickel a pair below his competitors ' price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undies was just another clothing company , and J.P . was merely an uppie . And by the looks of the sales chart at the head of the meeting room , he was rapidly becoming a downie . <p> " December sales are as flat as July ! " he shouted in his high-pitched voice , slapping his palm on the table for emphasis . " Three days before Christmas and we have n't even seen a blip in the curve . What kind of an ad campaign are you people running that ca n't sell product at Christmas ? " <p> Mike wanted to tell old J.P . that his particular brand of underwear was n't exactly a perfect Christmas gift . He made mostly boxers and jockeys  --  perfectly good ones , Mike admitted  --  but not the sort of thing a person bought for a gift unless they were desperate . And even then , if Mike were desperate enough to buy underwear for a gift , he would at least get something from Fredericks or Heidi 's . <p> But he would never tell J.P . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do it , he would tell J.P . that his underwear was the best damned Christmas gift in the known universe . He would even tell other people that , in tonight 's and tomorrow 's editions of the newsnet . He pulled the printouts from his briefcase and marched up to the front of the room , where he laid the first of them on the projector . It showed a sexy woman  --  Sarah , in fact  --  wearing a Santa hat and little else , and smiling invitingly as she twirled a pair of Bundy 's briefs by their elastic band . Underneath the picture was the line , " Bundy 's fit better under the tree . " <p> There was a tense silence as every ad executive in the room waited for some clue how to react . Mike obligingly told them . " J.P. , " he said as he brought the lights down . " This ad will sell underwear , and here 's why . Because your underwear is the best damned Christmas gift in the known universe , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy was n't the only client who needed reassurance . Sales were down all across the board , from fifty-cent stocking stuffers all the way up to new cars and diamond jewelry . Mike and the rest of the staff at Penzley 's Advertising spent the entire day scrambling to jump-start the usual Christmas buying frenzy , but the atmosphere in their offices was that of a submarine crew in a sea full of depth charges . There might be a safe path through the next two days , but none of them knew what it was . In all likelihood , unless one of them had a brainstorm , they would lose every contract they had by New Year 's . <p> The only consolation was the knowledge that nobody else 's ads were working any better . People just were n't buying this year . The shops were full of browsers , but their wallets were staying firmly in their pockets . <p> Mike dug through sales figures from last year . They had been down , too , but then the reason was obvious . Backspace technology had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every family that could afford one had a single , telephone-booth sized present beside the tree on Christmas morning . That no doubt accounted for some of the drop in traditional sales this year , too , as latecomers to the fad picked up their units , but damn it , most people already had their Backspacer . They should be buying gloves and hats and overshoes for each other again . And underwear . <p> Mike stared out his window as the sun dropped behind the western horizon . It would be great if some future version of himself would leave him a clue . God knew , he certainly would do it if he had a clue to give , but if his future self figured it out beyond the Backspacer 's two-week return limit , then he was screwed . And the fact that nobody in the entire agency had shouted " Eureka " all day did n't bode well . <p> He was too tired to shop for Sarah 's present on the way home . He probably should have , he thought when a wild-eyed street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of his subway car and began shouting about the evils of backspacing , but the sudden decrease in riders as people looped back to take another car at least gave him room to stretch out . The preacher focused his attention on the few remaining riders  --  the only riders to get on , from everyone 's revised point of view  --  but Mike tuned him out with practiced ease . He had bigger problems to occupy his mind . <p> Sarah was gone when he got home . Working late at the bank , no doubt handling another insurance company 's bankruptcy papers . That meant it was Mike 's job to cook dinner , but he just was n't up to it yet . He flipped on the TV and settled into the couch for a bad movie first . He could loop around in an hour or so and start dinner a few minutes from now , and if he was careful not to interrupt himself in either the living room or the kitchen , he would n't create a paradox . <p> Beyond the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside , just to the left of the window , the Christmas tree was dark in its corner . Mike aimed the remote at it and turned on its lights , then watched them twinkle in counterpoint to the city outside . His gaze slid downward to the packages beneath it  --  including one that had n't been there this morning . Bright green wrapping , with red ribbon and a red bow . About the size of a bread box . Had Sarah put something for him there after he 'd left for work ? <p> He got up to see , but when he read the tag he felt a shiver of excitement run down his spine . To Sarah , it read . Merry Christmas from your eternal lover , Michael . <p> From him ? But he had n't bought her anything . . . yet . <p> He looked at the package , picked it up , shook it . It did n't rattle , but it had some mass . It could be anything , though , in a box that size . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no doubt packed it that way deliberately  --  would no doubt pack it that way  --  to fool himself as well as Sarah . There was no reason for him to know ahead of time what he had bought her . In fact , it heightened the mystery if he did n't . <p> He suddenly felt ten pounds lighter . The whole weight of the Present Problem had just been lifted from his shoulders . Now he was free to concentrate on his other problem , which was why the hell nobody was buying anything this year . <p> He looked down at the package , then out the window at the city , and he laughed . He held the answer to that in his hand , too . It would n't enable him to sell a damned thing until after Christmas , and poor old J.P . ' s Bundywear was just going to have to get by on practical parents , but at least he knew why nobody was buying anything yet . After a year of growing used to the Backspacer , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives , and like him , they were all waiting to learn what the perfect gift would be before they went out and bought it . <p> At least he could point out to his clients one bright side to the situation : Nobody would be returning unwanted presents this year . <p> He shook Sarah 's gift again . Did it shift a little bit ? He held it up to his ear and shook it once more . Suddenly he felt all the excitement of being a kid at Christmas again . Only two days until he and Sarah opened their presents . He could n't wait to see what he 'd bought her . <p> <p> By Jerry Oltion <p> Every year , writers in Eugene Oregon , celebrate Christmas by reading stories in front of the fire .
