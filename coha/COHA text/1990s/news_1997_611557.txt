<p> Mobutu Kongolo always seemed to have a special affinity for Switzerland . The son of Zaire 's fallen dictator attended school here , bestowed gifts of diamonds on his closest friends , and basked in the attention of financiers eager to cultivate one of Africa 's bigger family fortunes . <p> Far from the chaotic poverty of his homeland , young Mobutu also found the Alpine nation a pleasant base for his mercantile interests . In May 1995 , he registered a trading company named Yoshad in the town of Martigny , according to the commercial registrar 's office in the Swiss canton of Valais . <p> Among its activities , the company listed " show business . " But its main purpose , Swiss investigators say , was to channel funds from sale of Zaire 's copper , cobalt , gold and diamond resources into family bank deposits . Letters signed by Mobutu Kongolo requested that clients make payments for precious metals and minerals into a numbered Swiss account . <p> As the Mobutu clan began a humiliating journey into exile last week , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family fortune  --  once estimated at between $ 4 billion and $ 7 billion  --  accumulated during three decades in power . <p> To the chagrin of Kabila 's government , however , the Mobutu money trail is proving maddeningly elusive . While the Swiss government says it has impounded all wealth linked to the dictator , Kabila 's envoys say they are getting no help in determining if Mobutu 's funds are still in Switzerland , have been moved , or have been spent . <p> " Everybody knows that Mobutu kept a lot of his assets here . So where did they go ? And if the money left the country , where are the documents to prove it ? We just want clear answers to these questions , " said Jose Mutombo-Kady , a member of Kabila 's ruling alliance who was sent here to find the money . <p> Some critics say the saga of Mobutu 's money could erupt into another scandal , damaging to Switzerland 's reputation as it tries to recover from charges that Swiss bankers and businessmen collaborated with Nazi Germany . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped a freeze on all family assets . The government ordered the country 's 400 banks to report by the end of the month on all holdings by Mobutu or any people and companies associated with him . <p> Swiss authorities say an initial search of the country 's 12 leading banks turned up no trace of Mobutu 's money . They surmise that Mobutu moved large portions of his wealth out of the country after Switzerland introduced new laws in 1990 making it more difficult to launder the fortunes of drug smugglers and dictators . <p> " I ca n't imagine that today any Swiss bank would still have money from Mobutu . Such a bank would be extremely silly , " said Kurt Hauri , president of the Federal Banking Commission , who is supervising the sweep of the nation 's banks in search of Mobutu 's assets . <p> Jean Ziegler , a Socialist member of parliament and longtime critic of Swiss banking secrecy , says he doubts the claim that none of Mobutu 's money is left in Switzerland . " Swiss banks are world champions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke screens , " said Ziegler . " We 're talking about companies owned by Mobutu 's family , with very complicated structures and accounts of the whole clan . " <p> The credibility of Swiss banks is at a record low following disclosures involving looted Nazi gold , dormant accounts of Holocaust victims , and earlier cases of protecting the stolen wealth of Third World potentates . <p> Ziegler said the banks undoubtedly know the fate of Mobutu 's assets but are reluctant to help because they do not want to compromise their reputation for secrecy . " Swiss bankers are absurdly precise bookkeepers , " he said . " This is one of the Swiss virtues . They cheat and lie to their clients and the world , but they are bookkeepers by heart . " <p> Even if Swiss authorities pin down Mobutu 's hidden assets , it is unclear whether Kabila 's government will be able to get its hands on his money soon . Much of the fortunes sequestered in Swiss accounts by the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and Haiti 's Duvalier family is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials say they are eager to return to the money to the now democratic governments , but they are forbidden from doing so until local courts decide who shall get the funds . In the Marcos case , more than $ 500 million is stuck in Swiss bank vaults because the courts have not resolved rival claims by the Philippine government , the Marcos family and victims of human rights abuses during the 1965-86 Marcos era . <p> " We are not the owner , we can not keep the money , we can not distribute the money , " said Switzerland 's economics minister , Jean-Pascal Delamuraz , who led a Swiss delegation to Manila recently in an effort to resolve the case . " It is none of our business . We just want the funds to go to the rightful claimants . " <p> The Mobutu fortune undoubtedly reaches beyond the Swiss domain . Roughly two dozen foreign properties , with a market value estimated from $ 40 billion to $ 60 million , are the only visible part of his financial empire . They include sumptuous residences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Africa , and coffee plantations in Brazil and the Ivory Coast . <p> The extent of Mobutu 's liquid assets , however , is open to question . Some experts believe he exhausted much of his fortune in the last few years , having to pay huge sums to the military , the political opposition and his own retinue to cling to power . <p> Others suggest that a considerable sum of money , still counted in billions of dollars , is parked abroad . Kabila 's representatives have been scouring Belgium , France , Luxembourg , Morocco and South Africa as possible havens . They say they have uncovered few significant assets . <p> The dry holes have brought them back to Switzerland . Until this year , Mobutu received VIP treatment here , including full police protection , during long sojourns at his villa in Savigny and his recent prostate cancer treatment in nearby Lausanne . His entourage would occupy two entire floors at the plush Beau Rivage hotel , running up bills amounting to several million dollars a month . <p> Even though the dictator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast bulk of his wealth is socked away in Switzerland . They said Mobutu Kongolo and other family members controlled funds running into billions of dollars and that over time they built up a vast network of front companies and false identities to mask the money . <p> With the country 's moral reputation at stake , Swiss justice officials say they will mete out harsh punishment to any bank found dealing in Mobutu 's money . The government insists it will no longer tolerate banking practices that shield illicit wealth . <p> This year , Swiss authorities accused Josef Oberholzer , a former vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland , of laundering $ 150 million for Colombian drug dealers over more than a decade . He was the highest-ranking Swiss banker ever to be charged with such a crime . <p> Oberholzer was convicted and forced to surrender all income earned from handling the account . But he did not have to serve a prison term because the prosecution could not prove beyond any doubt that he was fully aware that the money was gleaned from illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiver through the Swiss banking industry and prompted many banks to purge accounts they suspected of being linked to illicit activities . Zurich public prosecutor Dieter Jann said he is prepared to take future money-laundering cases to the highest courts to get convictions . <p> " Even though we were not able to show that this banker acted intentionally , we hope his trial will serve as a good lesson , " Jann said in an interview . " We are determined to apply these new laws to clean up our country 's reputation as a haven for dirty money . And we hope that Swiss banks will take this warning seriously . " <p> In recent months , Swiss authorities have taken other steps to show they mean business . They have frozen $ 84 million in Swiss bank accounts held by Raul Salinas de Gortari , the brother of a Mexican former president , because Mexican prosecutors have said the money came from drug dealers . <p> They also have taken unprecedented measures to settle accounts involving money allegedly stolen by dictators . Last month , Switzerland agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mali , which had pressed for the repatriation of funds taken by former dictator Moussa Traore , who was ousted in 1991 . <p> It is the first time that Switzerland will actually hand over money from a toppled head of state , based on claims by a successor government that the cash was deposited illegally , according to Swiss justice officials . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 28 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : An article on Monday erroneously stated that former Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko 's approximately two dozen foreign properties had an estimated total market value of between $ 40 billion and $ 60 million . The estimated value is between $ 40 million and $ 60 million .
