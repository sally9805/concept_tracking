<p> At end of winter every year , this corner of Europe is thronged for four days and nights of singing , dancing and firecracker-popping that climax in a fiery exorcism . The phenomenon  --  not Catholicism , exactly , but the distinctly local religion of the fallas  --  dates to the Middle Ages but has never been so popular or elaborate as in the last couple of decades . <p> Priestless and only barely sacred , this faith is rooted in more than 400 " associations " that gather in mean neighborhood clubhouses  --  usually little more than a clutch of card tables in a local tavern . Throughout the year , hundreds of ornate and outrageous 75-foot-tall papier-mache monuments  --  the fallas  --  are designed and built at huge time and expense borne solely by offerings from the people . Then , on the appointed night , the fallas are set to the torch in massive bonfires of release and redemption . <p> As an indication of a community of faith , measured in participation , financial support , spirituality , tradition and sacred rite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seldom does as well , as the fallas . <p> " This is what I identify with , this is where my faith is , " said Celedonio Toledo , a welder in the fallas club in the Valencia suburb of Masanasa . " If I were n't doing this , I would n't be doing anything religious at all . " <p> Valencia 's feast of the fallas , held in mid-March every year , is among a host of new ways Europeans are channeling the spiritual energy that science and state and a loss of religious memory have been unable to extinguish . <p> Late-century Europe can easily be called the most Godless quarter on earth . That , in any case , has been the prevailing wisdom . But today , following the rest of the world , Europe is effervescent with new religiosity  --  be it imported from afar , recovered from old , or renewed in a contemporary idiom . <p> More than half of Europe 's citizens still profess to be Catholics , while nearly a third identify themselves as Protestants . Yet few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the social upheavals of the 1960s . The most obvious sign and most profound consequence has been the tumble to near extinction of the traditional parish church and the geographically based congregation that sustained it . <p> " Many Europeans have ceased to belong to their religious institutions in any meaningful sense , but they have not abandoned  --  so far  --  many of their deep-seated religious motivations , " said Grace Davie , a sociologist of religion at the University of Exeter in England . <p> No one is certain just how large the new movements are ; much of the religious ferment is happening on the margins of established religions . But signs of it can be found throughout the continent . <p> The Spaniards are creating a national patchwork of local , Christian-inspired but overtly secular religions . The French are sampling Buddhism and massing on pilgrimages to shrines of obscure saints . The Italians are returning to long-buried Catholic forms and ideals in communities of renewal . The British are modernizing their parish life and feeding a hunger for Bible study . The Swedes are reclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans are struggling to absorb and convert a virtually de-Christianized East German population . And all Europeans are learning to live with the growing presence of Islam . <p> For a quarter-century , Europe has welcomed Protestant evangelism imported or copied from North America . Baptists , Methodists , Assemblies of God , Jehovah 's Witnesses , even Episcopalians , are spreading their message with slow but growing success . <p> Europe no less than the United States has cottoned to New Age spiritualism , Hinduism , Transcendental Meditation , the Unification Church , Krishna Consciousness , occultism , faith healing . The Church of Scientology is locked in struggle with the German government to enhance its tax status as a certified religion . Cults also have made a mark in Europe , most recently with the self-immolation of members of the Order of the Solar Temple . <p> Religious books , on Buddhism and Jesus alike , are bestsellers . This season 's French religious bestseller is the ultimate spiritual cafeteria line : The two-volume , 2,469-page , eight-pound , $ 120 " Encyclopedia of World Religions . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent long dominated by two major Christian churches . Its centuries of religious wars and the Holocaust may be history , but the rhetorical foundations of a secular society are being shaken anew by the continent 's growing Muslim community that has made Islam the third religion of France , Germany and Britain . <p> Much of a new generation is coming of age with little or no religion as a point of cultural and personal reference . The post-World War II generation could still remember a tradition ; but since they did n't pass it on , their children are religious blank slates . <p> For some this is an opportunity . The young " know nothing of religion , so they have no prejudices against it , " observed Neil Blough , a Mennonite church historian in a Paris suburb . " Some of them even think Jesus and God are American inventions . " <p> Such are the spiritual temptations for the young that Nick Cuthbert , founding pastor of a contemporary-style Protestant church in a suburb of Birmingham , England , devoted a recent Sunday message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing suggested what the old churches , even the ones trying to modernize , are up against in today 's thriving European religious marketplace . He named Ouija boards , " The X-Files , " witchcraft , levitation , divination , fortune-telling , palmistry and astrology . <p> Indeed , many young people exhibit a phenomenon familiar to American sociologists of contemporary religion : " zapping " among religions , surfing for faiths that appeal to them . A French term for it is bricolage , loosely translated as do-it-yourselfism . " Religion , like so many other things , has entered the world of options , lifestyles and preferences , " Davie said . <p> " We believe , but we do n't practice , " said Vicente Gamon , an electrician , one evening at his local fallas clubhouse in Valencia . Across the table , Juan Costa , a mason , put it differently . " We are Catholics , but we are not believers , " he said . " Each one of us takes Catholicism at his own speed and approach . . . . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't conform to reality , so in the course of my life I created my own . " <p> Not everyone has left the church , and those who have remained or come back have been drawn down one of two seemingly divergent paths that represent the growth sectors of European religiosity . <p> One is toward contemporary expressions of faith in a secular vernacular often inspired by American churches that demystify and deformalize religion with rock music , sneaker-wearing pastors and messages that emphasize psychological counseling , social justice and environmental protection . Much of Europe 's environmentalist movement is rooted in churches . <p> The other path is directed toward Christian roots , toward old and sacred forms of religious expression , including Latin prayers , ornate liturgies , the burning of incense and a rediscovery of mystery and emotion . These are often called charismatic Christians . <p> Much of the first trend echoes practices in the United States . The typical American 's strong religious identification and continuous reinvention of religious practices are often remarked upon by Europeans who , after all , bequeathed most Americans their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a case in point . An artist , teacher and mother of two who lives in Paris , Laporte-Bisquit left her Catholic church as an adolescent and looked ahead to life as an atheist . Then a friend gave her a Bible and introduced her to a Protestant evangelical community that she first embraced , then found cloying , even " paranoiac " about outsiders . <p> She moved to Washington for four years and found an American evangelical church she liked , Christ Church on Massachusetts Avenue  --  a " marvelously managed " place where , unlike the typical French church , her children were welcomed and ethnic minorities were abundant . Upon returning to France she joined the nondenominational American Church on the Left Bank of the Seine River for the same reasons . <p> Laporte-Bisquit feels liberated from a Catholic religion that was " a ritual , not a true statement of faith . . . . I do n't like to be obliged to think something . " Now , she said , " I tell the kids , we 're Protestants . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you choose not to follow , that 's your choice . " <p> Dominique Juray has taken a dramatically different path . An Air France flight attendant for two decades until her recent retirement , she too abandoned her Catholic religion in the countercultural wave of 1968 and became a " perfect secularist . " <p> But in her forties , beset by fears that African immigrants were going to " submerge " France and a sense of alienation from what the French called la pensee unique  --  political correctness is a loose translation  --  she started shopping for churches that reflected her conservative values . <p> Now she is a member of one of the religious renewal communities practicing a back-to-the-roots and implicitly anti-ecclesiastical Catholicism in the Brittany region of northwest France . She fulminates against all that the Vatican II Ecumenical Council in the early 1960s did to modernize the Catholic church by no longer conducting services in Latin and adopting informal and popularized liturgies in an effort to hold on to a distracted flock . <p> " That kind of thing lowers God to man 's level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets , in our memories , something rich and beautiful  --  and yet we insult God by offering him something ugly , like potatoes on a paper plate . " <p> The family of charismatic churches she has found represent European Catholicism 's most enthusiastic followers these days : communities of Christians who  --  following an example set from the 1960s in the United States among Protestant evangelicals and Catholics  --  express their love of God in Bible study and silent prayer , by " speaking in tongues " they do n't rationally comprehend , and by worshiping by lifting or waving their arms in homage to their God . <p> In the church Juray found , where Gregorian chants instill a sense of holy mystery , " I feel a continuity with our origins going back 1,500 years  --  the same ceremonies , words , gestures transmitted from generation to generation . " <p> A third path takes people on a quest far from the roots of their religious upbringing . Philippe Poiret , who received his first communion from Pope John XXIII in 1951 , has migrated from Catholicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , finally , to Buddhism . Now a prominent television production executive in Paris , Poiret , 57 , complements his high-powered business by meditating 60 minutes daily , practicing martial arts and listening to audio tapes based on the " Tibetan Book of Life and Death , " a major bestseller in France . " It 's an essential part of my life , " he said . <p> While regular churchgoing is down steeply in Europe , attendance at major religious events  --  notably during the Christmas season  --  is up . Increasingly , faith is being expressed not in ordinary habit , but in extraordinary acts of participation like the fallas . <p> The phenomenon is repeated across Spain and Portugal , and across the European continent at local saints ' festivals and quasi-religious rituals . The most ancient form of extraordinary religious ritual , the pilgrimage , is enjoying startling new life . Pilgrim magazine in France circulates to 340,000 customers every week . <p> Take the shrine of St. Therese of the Christ Child in the French town of Lisieux . A Carmelite nun who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , St. Therese left behind letters and other writings and an example of humility and piety that have earned her a place of extraordinary popularity among even disengaged Catholics , and intellectual respect among priests and theologians . <p> The Basilica of Lisieux , said the Rev. Raymond Zambelli , its rector , has become " an oasis , an island , a place to stop and catch your breath "  --  and a destination for nearly 2 million pilgrims every year . <p> Perhaps the most impressive recent sign of what French sociologist Daniele Hervieu-Leger describes as a burgeoning " pilgrim sensibility " was Pope John Paul II 's global youth rally on the Longchamp racetrack in Paris last August . For weeks before , the French media reported disappointing advance numbers for the World Youth Days festival . France 's rock-bottom church attendance , undisciplined sexual and social mores and century-long officially secular government presaged a huge embarrassment to the 77-year-old pope . <p> But as it turned out , more than a million young people from across the continent , well over half from France , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that struck many observers as a Christian Woodstock , a merger of a rock concert and a worship service . It left the French Catholic church marveling and wondering how to turn that latent religiosity into deeper faith or even regular practice . <p> The problem for the pope  --  and the reality of the religious scene across Catholic Europe  --  is that the young people who came to Longchamp " never set foot in church , " said Hervieu-Leger . For her , the event suggested opportunities for a renewed Catholicism if it recognizes the late-20th century appeal of the mass pilgrimage . <p> " It is everything parish life is not : mobile rather than stable , based on the individual rather than the territory of a parish , voluntary rather than obligatory , extraordinary rather than ordinary , " Hervieu-Leger said . It is also " modular , " she said  --  those who come feel the freedom to pick and choose , to express their admiration for the pope and the Catholic tradition while rejecting the church 's teachings on contraception and abortion . <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least nominally religious actors , those who flocked and continue to flock to the edges of the tunnel where Princess Diana died in Paris Aug. 31 are also pilgrims of a vaguely spiritual kind , praying , crying and laying flowers at an improvised shrine . She was " an archetype , a kind of modern saint , " said Frederic Lenoir , a French scholar of religion . <p> Jacques Duquesne , whose two recent books retelling the life of Jesus have been runaway bestsellers in France , said this youthful religiosity " is not a profound faith . " He said , " The young look for occasions to get together . ' It 's fun . Let 's go . ' . . . The church to them is like Amnesty International . It 's very good on human rights , but when it interferes in your personal life , they do n't want it . "
