<p> Will Troy 's back heal in time for the Redskins ? Will Emmitt ever sign ? Will the Cowboys repeat as Super Bowl champions , or will they fade into the background as yet another one-year wonder ? <p> The questions might be few , but they are intriguing nonetheless as players report today for the start of another training camp in Austin , where Jimmy Johnson and his staff will be hoping once again to find all the right answers . <p> 1 . " " Will Troy Aikman be ready to play in Washington on that opening Monday night ? Early projections were he might miss as many as three regular-season games . " Aikman was throwing the ball , and with zip , at the final quarterback school this week . Remember , the recovery time was estimated at six to 12 weeks . Split the difference , and he 'll be ready for the final preseason game , if not sooner . Barring a setback ( and there is concern Aikman 's stubbornness will be a problem in that regard ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten by October . <p> 2 . " " What if newly acquired backup Hugh Millen has to play ? " <p> That probably would n't be a total disaster . Millen , acquired from New England after Steve Beuerlein got big free-agent bucks from Phoenix , has played well at times , and for subpar teams . He knows offensive coordinator Norv Turner 's system . Assuming Emmitt Smith is in the fold by opening night , the supporting cast will be first rate . <p> And , remember , Dallas made a nice late-season run two years ago behind Beuerlein . No one is excited about 16 games of Millen , but the Cowboys could survive a few . <p> 3 . " " So the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player can be replaced , at least on a temporary basis . Is anybody indispensable ? " <p> Emmitt Smith , three-time Pro Bowler , two-time NFL rushing champ . The Man Who Makes the Cowboys Go . <p> Johnson and owner Jerry Jones know that . The bad news , for them , is that Smith and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made approximately $ 465,000 last year , has been making noises about getting a deal worth about $ 4 million a year . <p> He 's probably $ 1 million or more high , but he 'll get a nice raise . <p> Because Jones will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into agreeing on the $ 3 million , Smith wo n't be in training camp any time soon , if at all . <p> Expect him to be on hand at RFK Stadium on Sept. 6 , though . <p> Emmitt is no dummy  --  his outside interests dry up in a big hurry if he is n't wearing No. 22 for the Cowboys  --  and Jones and Johnson know they have a potential dynasty on their hands with him , an average team without him . After six weeks or so of the standard finger-pointing and general theatrics , everyone will kiss and make up . <p> 4 . " " Any other contract disputes of note ? " <p> Not really . Jones says fullback Daryl Johnston will be signed in time to report today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other than the Smith issue , Dallas is pretty well set . . . <p> unusually so for a defending champion . <p> 5 . " " How about the rest of the offense ? Any big changes coming ? " Coordinator Norv Turner is sure to add a wrinkle or two , but personnel matters are not a pressing issue . The Cowboys need to find a replacement for third wide receiver Kelvin Martin ( lost to Seattle in free agency ) , and that could be rookie Kevin Williams or second-year man Jimmy Smith . Nate Newton 's arthritic knee might be a problem , too , but Newton is talking a good game , and Kevin Gogan is a reasonable alternative at guard and tackle . <p> 6 . " No one seemed to believe the Cowboys were the NFL 's best defensive team in 1992 , but they ranked No. 1 in fewest yards allowed and gave up only 47 points in the playoffs . Will they be that good again ? " They might be better . The fight for jobs in the secondary will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darren Woodson at safety . Rookie Darrin Smith is expected to replace Vinson Smith at outside linebacker before season 's end . Middle linebacker Robert Jones should be better after a year of experience , and the line is solid two-deep . Even the loss of coordinator Dave Wannstedt ( the new head coach of the Bears ) should be softened by the promotion of highly regarded assistant Butch Davis . <p> 7 . " " Was n't the release of punter Mike Saxon a little strange , coming just a week before training camp ? " <p> Only in the timing . Saxon 's performance had fallen in recent years , and that blocked punt in the Super Bowl only sealed things . <p> As an eight-year veteran , Saxon was n't likely to get better , and the Cowboys think they might improve with potential replacements Steve Domingos and John Jett . Johnson 's history suggests he is n't afraid to hand over a big job to a rookie , as he did with kicker Lin Elliott last summer . <p> 8 . " " Where is the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the resolution of the Aikman/Smith questions all the more pressing . After opening at Washington , the Cowboys return home to face their Super Bowl acquaintances , the Bills , the following Sunday . Next : a road trip to improving Phoenix . For a team aspiring to home-field advantage throughout the playoffs , this is a rough way to open . <p> 9 . " " Any signs the Cowboys are fat and happy after winning it all so soon ? " <p> Not many . Many of these people remember 1-15 , and they are n't interested in going back that way . <p> Comfort is not something Jimmy Johnson encourages or accepts . <p> ( If Dallas had blown a playoff game the way the Oilers did in Buffalo , JJ would have been shoving people out the door at 30,000 feet on the plane ride home . ) Johnson will mix in just enough rookies to freshen things a bit , and the nucleus is sound . At this week 's final quarterback school , most of the principals appeared ready ( if not necessarily anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 10 . " " So the Cowboys will repeat ? " <p> Who knows ? Nearly everything went right in 1992 . Until backup tight end Alfredo Roberts was hurt in the regular-season 's final game , the only significant injury had been to special teams captain Bill Bates . This year , the Aikman question arose in June , and an offseason back injury to defensive end Charles Haley ( not considered serious ) raised an eyebrow or two as well . <p> Still , if the Cowboys get healthy and stay that way , they should be able to do it all again . Why not ? They caught and passed the 49ers last year , and San Francisco is a cut above anything the AFC has to offer . If they did n't leave their heart in Pasadena , the Cowboys should be pouring the bubbly one more time at the Georgia Dome in ' 94.
