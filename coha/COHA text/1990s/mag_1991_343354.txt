THE MARRYING MAN Directed by Jerry Rees ; Screenplay by Neil Simon <P> Yelling . Sulking . Wall punching . Dangerous objects flying through the air . And , of course , one of the stars threatening to take a few days off in Brazil . Seems she had an urgent need to consult with her psychic . The near unmaking of The Marrying Man and the on-set tiffing between its lead actors , Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger , made a much read and sermonized-over feature in Premiere magazine . See what happens , said Hollywood , when you give stars too much power as well as too much money . <P> Oh , well , you know the old show-biz saying : Bad rehearsal , good show . Or , in this case , pretty good show . Like a lot of us who came of age in the late ' 40s and early ' 50s , Neil Simon obviously based his youthful fantasies about the glamorous life on newspaper reports of " playboys " ( such a quaint word ) , who when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fast women . The script has about it a nice , sweet-dreaming quality , and animation director Jerry Rees , working for the first time on a feature , has invested The Marrying Man with a very pleasant innocence of spirit . <P> That is not as easy as it sounds . The lead lounge lizard , toothpaste heir Charley Pearl ( Baldwin ) , is engaged and attending a Las Vegas bachelor party when he falls into obsession with nightclub singer Vicki Anderson ( Basinger ) . She , in turn , is the mistress of the Strip 's founding mobster , Bugsy Siegel . In other words , these are not people with whom one feels an immediate natural identification . Nor is their problem  --  a stormy relationship that requires them to marry and separate four times  --  one for which most people are likely to have an affinity . <P> About all that can be said for Charley is that his reluctance to marry a spoiled-rotten fiance ( Elisabeth Shue ) and take on a classically choleric movie mogul ( Robert Loggia ) in the bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicki is that she is pretty and sings sexily . <P> It is the sleight-of-hand plot , which requires the pair to keep marrying and separating , that redeems the picture . The film is so quick and busy that most of the time one forgets they are essentially no-accounts , not entirely bright or likable . Indeed , Simon 's admission that they are based on historical models  --  shoe magnate Harry Karl and starlet Marie ( " the Body " ) McDonald , whose misadventures in multiple marriage titillated tabloid readers four decades ago  --  renders the jolliness of his writing , and Rees ' direction , all the more astonishing . They were , perhaps , a very odd couple , but not necessarily a fun couple . <P> Charley is surrounded by some funny best friends , led by comedian Paul Reiser , who keeps the one-liners bouncing . And Baldwin plays dumb and earnest in an engaging way . Basinger is something of a problem . She is a very self- absorbed actress who gives the impression of a woman trying to get in on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wistfully of tart , smart Michelle Pfeiffer in The Fabulous Baker Boys . But you ca n't have everything , and considering the difficulties of its creation , The Marrying Man is something : a comedy that bounces skittishly down a lane that memory has not traveled in a while . Maybe it 's silly . But it does awaken a nostalgic fondness for an era when celebrity dreaming was goofier , giddier and less consequential than it is now .
