August 5 , 1874 <p> Dearest Annie , <p> I trust you are well and not too lonely . A body needs company , no matter how much you resist that notion . Come visit me in San Francisco when you can . <p> Boston , whence I am writing you , is sweltering , as is usual for this time of year . I am in the city on business , the first time I have been east since October 1859 . Such a long time ago . I am much changed , as I expect you are . I wonder how you are . <p> I had dinner last night with a group of people at Miss Alice Hooper 's . In the dreadful heat of August we were served turtle soup , sole bonne femme , roast beef , wild rice with brown gravy , carrots boiled to the point of death , with the Irish maid serving at the right , and the black butler taking away from the left . <p> Microcosmic setting , to be sure . <p> I was seated between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other a cotton mill proprietor . The conversation veered into the past , of course ; to those days when righteousness and excitement came together . An almost unbeatable combination . <p> Miss Hooper led the way , with an obvious nostalgia for that time , when ladies usually confined to Transcendental conversazioni in parlors where windows were concealed by heavy drapes , and the air was heavy and there was no light , when they were let loose , went roaming all over the city on war business , the work of the Sanitary Commission , etc . <p> You know , and I know , that it 's probably a failing of mine , bred of a natural impatience and a learned mistrust , but I never had much truck with those ladies and their sewing circles . And I know that 's a way of making light of their contributions to the cause . Embroidery and abolition : threads on a runner delineating an African slave ( chainstitch particularly apt ) , supplicating , " Am I not a woman and your sister ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! !  --  but supplication was not our mode , and divergence was inevitable . But you know all this . <p> What will they do now that Boston and environs are proving attractive to southern black folks The WAR was one thing . All that glory ! ! hallelujah ! ! Robert Gould Shaw ( to whom everyone in Boston but the Irish claims to be related ) and his dry bones mixing with African bones ( for which his mother was greatly praised ; eschewing Mount Auburn for a nigger trench ) . Think he flew back home with them ? Or weighed them down ? Lord , have mercy , to be responsible for them after death when all you really desire is peace and the African landscape . Promise me  --  should you have any say in the matter  --  when I die they put me all to myself ? <p> Perhaps I 'm wrong . I am not much changed at all . Maybe thornier ? <p> The occasion for dinner at Miss Alice Hooper 's was an unveiling of a painting purchased on her behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was holding forth . He was introduced as someone or other , art critic , veteran of the War , at Antietam no less ( bumped into Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. , on the road back , someone said ) , sometime lecturer at Harvard , thinking of heading west to " seek his fortune . " The painting as he spoke was shrouded in white , waiting for the magic moment when his description , of the artist , the critical reception ( Thackeray ridiculed it , he said ; that I remember ) , the provenance of the work , would be ended and the painting , having been shed of its shroud , might breathe . <p> We were sipping some fine Madeira as he spoke on , and stopped , and with a flourish drew back the white cloth and Miss Hooper 's new acquisition was revealed to us , and it was something else besides . At first it seemed a painting of a fiery sky , a stark white light was at the center , on the horizon , and a ship foundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title ? " asked someone who apparently had dozed through the introduction , or taken more than his share of the Madeira , and the claret , and the pouilly-fuisse before  --  Lord , these folks can drink ! <p> Miss Hooper was graciousness itself , and spoke the title with apparent disinterest , " The Slave Ship : Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying , Typhoon Coming On , painted in 1840 by Joseph Mallord William Turner , a great genius , and sympathetic to our cause . " She gave sufficient information to silence the inattentive . Then she turned to me . <p> " Mrs. Pleasant ? " <p> " Yes , Miss Hooper ? " <p> " Perhaps you can instruct the company about the incident the painter was illustrating . " <p> I was n't at all sure . What incident did Turner choose ? Which of the hundreds that came to light ? Did it coincide with those I knew ? <p> " I 'm afraid I am not at all sure . " <p> " Oh , " she said , clearly disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the guests . That awful thing that can happen at a table of invited people happened : There was dead silence . Failure lurked . <p> In silence we were left with the painting , which dominated the room . It might well have cast shadows across us . <p> I wondered who would look away first . <p> " Perhaps I can help , Miss Hooper , " the sometime lecturer at Harvard spoke up . <p> " Please do , Mr. Bodley . " <p> I finally caught his name . <p> There was almost a collective sigh , as words drew attention from image . <p> " Turner based the painting on a ship named the Zong , an infamous case in which the traders threw slaves , living and dead , overboard , to collect the insurance money and not lose their investment . " <p> It is with statements like those , clear and dispassionate , that I am reminded of it  --  all of it . Who insured the ship and its cargo ? Was it Lloyd 's of London , for example ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlocking directorates ? <p> I wanted to cut off the conversation to avoid them becoming privy to my feelings . I could feel my emotions rising . My eyes were locked on the foreground of the painting , where a few brown arms , some lengths of chain , and one brown leg , glanced through the waves , alongside magnificently colored fish . The fish were clearly in their habitat ; the arms and leg and chains were alien to the sea . <p> I was grateful that the artist had portrayed it thus , indicating the horror of the thing aslant , by these few members , and a reminder of their confinement , the irons which would take them down . It got to me . <p> I turned to Miss Hooper . " Where will you hang it " I inquired . <p> " I have not decided yet , " she responded . <p> Mr. Bodley , apparently eager to tell us more , spoke up . <p> " You know , Ruskin , whose father gave it to him as a New Year 's present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but eventually had to conceal it . He found it impossibly painful to live with day after day . As I said before , it comes directly to Miss Hooper from Ruskin himself , via a dealer of course . " <p> Of course . And of course a father would give the thing to the son to welcome the New Year . And the son would adorn the parlor or wherever with it . <p> " I am sorry it caused Mr. Ruskin so much pain , " I could n't stop myself saying , but no one seemed to catch my bitterness . " Are there any suggestions from the assembled company ? " Mr. Bodley was about to turn the question of where to hang the painting into a parlor game , with each guest trying to be cleverer than the next . At least that was my fear . You know , I really do n't like to dislike people , to distrust them , but I felt the old wave wash over me ( perhaps in collusion with the slaves of Turner 's painting I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew someone was about to say something to justify my distrust ; why should this evening be different form so many others ? Someone did . " The thing is behind us ; surely we can enjoy the art it engendered . The man had a brilliance about him , with form , color . " I could not tell the speaker . I glanced at the butler , and we locked eyes , briefly , notice , we hoped by non of them . I turned to Miss Hooper , whose face was blanched ; who remained silent . Shortly thereafter , now deaf to all remarks , I got up , took a cigar from the humidor , causing a stir , and said goodnight . I returned to the Parker House , where the doorman inquired as to what floor I was working on  --  this despite my evening clothes , or perhaps because of them . And I a woman of sixty ! Perhaps the cigar smoke wreathing my head clouded his vision . I assured him I was a guest . Today I head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the places I grew up . Enough of my adventures . Write me at 1661 Octavia Street , San Francisco , California , when you get the chance . If you are still among the living . My love , as ever , Mary Ellen The dining room of the Parker House early the next morning was populated mostly by men of middle age , prosperous-looking , their heads bowed in conversation or in communion with their eggs . The noise of the room was dull and constant , but low . No one raised his voice . Waiters bowed slightly to take orders for the lush morning repasts people once enjoyed , all accompanied by the world-famous Parker House rolls , and pots of hot coffee , the beans for which had been imported , shipped , and sold by some of the men in this very room . Pewter bowls of golden demarara adorned each table . Behind the dark paneling the kitchen was in a frenzy , as orders piled up , and the heat of the day began to rise , enhancing the glow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another . Back in the dining room , a man was standing  --  hologramatically speaking  --  invisible to the unsuspecting eye  --  under the portrait of the autocrat of the breakfast table . The hologrammatical man wore the whit waiter 's jacket and black bowtie of latter-day Parker House waiters . He was waiting on his time , when he would first be called Home-boy , the Detroit Red , then X. When Mary Ellen Pleasant glanced in his direction , she glimpsed the shadow of someone , but that high-ceilinged , portraited , aged room must be overwhelmed by shadows . And she was used to shadows , so he did n't frighten her . She tried to locate him in the past , not knowing he was an impression of the future . She only hoped he might offer company . Her entry into the dining room , her request for a table , had caused a stir , and only the expression on her face , the severity of her dress , and the silver dollar in her palm stopped the head waiter from asking with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She swept by him purposefully and chose a table to the side . She felt the eyes of the hologrammatical man over her right shoulder , felt the comfort of his breathing against her hair , as she unfolded the letter left in her pigeonhole at the desk . " May I ? " his face across from hers at the table . " Of course . " She responded without speaking . He slid into the chair across from hers . She could see his beautiful , as yet unborn eyes before her , could see herself reflected in them . August 5 , 1874 , midnight My dear Mrs. Pleasant , I trust you will receive this not the first thing tomorrow morning . Patrick will be driving it to the Parker House himself . The hour is , as I have noted , midnight . My guests have long since departed . My mother is asleep , as are the servants , and I have to myself time which is mine alone . I treasure these hours . It is now that I read , write , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like myself . No one can claim me at this moment . I am no one 's daughter ; I am neither property-owner , nor hostess . I am writing you because I noted you distress this evening , and your abrupt departure , and I wish to apologize for any contribution I may have made to your state of mind . I think I Understand , but I can not be entirely sure . <p> I was very surprised to receive the Turner painting . A well-meaning ( I expect ) relation arranged the purchase for me as an investment , since Turner 's reputation , as is too often the case , is rising since his death . <p> I can only presume that this well-meaning guardian of my fortunes saw that the subject matter of the work would echo my own sentiments with regard to slavery and the trade , and make the capitalist endeavor palatable to me . I am known in my family as someone rather disdainful of investment and planning . even for a female . Too many New England fortunes  --  as you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one way or another . I have tried as much as possible to separate myself from any profit which might by any filament , however slender , have been linked to the trade . <p> And an interesting ethical question arises : Did the money , my money , paid to the art dealer on my behalf for the Turner constitute the dealer 's profiting off the trade ? Even at this remove ? <p> Am I also , given the painting is an investment , guilty ? <p> The whole thing could become a game . For if I cut every link to every enterprise which might have supported the traffic in human souls  --  sold every piece of stock in every maritime company , for example  --  I would still have to reckon with the mills , the question of property in and of itself . This is something I struggle with , believe me , and because of which I could be seen , at best , eccentric , at worst , a traitor to my class . <p> When I asked you at dinner about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of you as someone familiar with the horrors of slavery and the Middle Passage . Far better educated in that regard than anyone at the table , particularly poor Mr. Bodley with his extraordinary grasp of ephemera . I was prevailing on you to educate us . To be our authority . I am sorry . <p> I should have spoken about the Zong . About the white flash of typhoon at the center of the work , surely comparable , in foreboding and whiteness to Melville 's white whale and Coleridge 's albatross  --  emblems of that belief which allowed and supported something like the slave trade . The belief which endangers the white race as well as the African . No . I should not save these thoughts for the hours I spend alone . <p> The thing I most regret about this past evening , and that which instigated your departure , was the remark of Bishop Cowell , which I would hope might be ascribed to overindulgence , but I am afraid not . At the moment he spoke I was stunned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women keep silent in the churches , for it is not given for them to speak , " ran through my brain , out of nowhere , everywhere , There . I admit to being a coward , and so his conclusion stands without opposition . <p> Please accept this apology , with my respect , <p> Alice Hooper <p> I was expecting something like this . Now what ? Do I respond : Dear Miss Hooper , all is forgiven ? Dear Miss Hooper , would you feel better if you had no money ? Dear Miss Hooper , when you contemplate the trade , can you understand the constructive use of violence in the cause of liberation ? And , dear Miss Hooper , this is my final question : Can you accept , nay believe in the deepest part of yourself , the full humanity of the African ? <p> Dear Miss Hooper , I do n't hate you and yours . I love my own . <p> With that the hologramatical man , who 'd been reading her mind reading the letter , smiled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The woman was trying . <p> Yes . <p> August 6 , 1874 , 9 A.M. <p> Dear Miss Hooper , <p> I hold nothing against you . I wish for you all the best . I think the difference between us may be reduced to the fact that while you focus on the background of the Turner painting , I can not tear my eyes from the foreground . It is who we are . <p> Yours sincerely , <p> Mary Ellen Pleasant <p> Author 's note : Alice Hooper , here imagined , was an actual person , sympathetic to abolition , who was the owner of the Turner painting . It was hanging in her home until her death in 1879 at the age of 38 , after a long and rather mysterious , undiagnosed illness . Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying went in 1899 to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . Go see it .
