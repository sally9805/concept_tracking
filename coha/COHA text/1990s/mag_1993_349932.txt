Should a woman lie to obtain an abortion ? Norma McCorvey thought so when she cried rape 20 years ago . The ruse failed and she was forced to have the baby , but McCorvey became " Jane Roe , " the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing reproductive freedom . Today , with the right to choose protected , the equal exercise of that right is in jeopardy , and important abortion proponents are urging women to follow McCorvey 's example  --  a strategy the Clinton Administration may eventually endorse , if only implicitly . <P> Despite a pro-choice President and a Democratic majority in Congress , the abortion-rights battle is set to boil again when the Congress begins considering Clinton 's health-reform legislation this week . The political war reflects the public 's ambivalence : a majority of Americans favor a woman 's right to choose but wish she would elect to have the baby . " Most view abortion as a privacy matter , " explains White House pollster Stan Greenberg . " But most abhor the act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ca n't pay for them . " <P> At the center of the controversy , then , is a double standard . With Roe as their shield , the better-off do as they please . For the poor , though , and for those without health insurance , choice is meaningless without the means to choose . Only 13 states voluntarily fund abortions for those who ca n't afford them ; the poor elsewhere are looking to Clinton to save them from the back alley . But Clinton 's options are limited by the Hyde Amendment , the 16-year- old constraint on the use of federal funds to finance abortions authored by Illinois Representative Henry Hyde . The law , which initially allowed federally funded abortions only if the mother 's life was endangered , was expanded last , summer to include cases of rape and incest . Furthermore , the revised Hyde Amendment requires only that a woman " self-certify " that an abortion is necessary . So , Representative Nita Lowey said recently , " I 'd tell my constituents , ' Send a letter . Say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heart disease . ' " Lowey admits such advice is " lousy public policy " ( and claims she was being ironic when she offered it ) , but other pro-choice advocates insist that a woman 's got to do what a woman 's got to do . Appalled that anyone would " counsel fraud by saying women should lie , " Hyde says he 'll fight to tighten the " loose language . " <P> The Administration , meanwhile , appears charmed by Lowey 's " advice . " Fearing a dustup that could scuttle health reform , Clinton is trying to sidestep the controversy by promising to cover " medically necessary pregnancy-related services . " If the President thinks he can dance around the pro-lifers with that language , he should think again . " Medically necessary " is a term of bureaucratic art . It dates from the days before Hyde 's amendment and was routinely interpreted as permitting abortion on demand . Hyde is ready for war : " No way am I going to let the crucial definitions be determined by the little one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
