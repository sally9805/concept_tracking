DOUG FOREMAN 'S FAT-FREE TORTILLA CHIP WAS A WINNER , BUT THE PARTNERSHIP HE MADE WITH HIS BEST FRIEND QUICKLY CRUMBLED <p> IN MAY 1992 DOUG FOREMAN MET Drew Westbrook , his partner and best friend , for lunch . Westbrook was planning to discuss his return to their company after an extended leave of absence . But Foreman , the president of Guiltless Gourmet Inc. , had a different agenda for the company 's sales manager . He fired him . <p> Though he 'd agonized over the decision , Foreman had anticipated neither of its consequences : not only did it jeopardize his control of the $20-million-a-year company he 'd started less than three years earlier , but it also would make Westbrook a millionaire . <p> <p> AS A DINER OWNER IN AUSTIN , TEX. , Foreman had dreamed up a recipe for a low-fat version of tortilla chips in an attempt to eliminate fried foods from his personal snack menu . His August 1989 invention gained such popularity that he baked chips every night after a full day at the diner 's grill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , so that November Foreman recruited the help of a trusted friend . Westbrook was a crackerjack salesman for a local radio station . After only two months of selling , though , Westbrook demanded equity in the new venture . Foreman readily agreed , and Westbrook hastily accepted Foreman 's offer  --  49% of the company in exchange for $25,000 . Foreman formalized the stock transfer on a piece of notebook paper , but he and the company 's chief financial officer , Bart Glaser , say Westbrook ponied up only $6,500 of that $25,000 and immediately began to repay himself from company cash . Nonetheless , Foreman struggled to maintain a friendly atmosphere at the cash-poor business . <p> In May 1990 Foreman sold the restaurant and moved the tortilla-baking equipment to a new bakery and headquarters . The additional capacity called for a sales push , but Westbrook 's effort was unimpressive . Foreman , who had to educate Westbrook about the basics of low-fat nutrition , estimates that for every sale Westbrook made to mainstream purchasing agents , there was a matching unsolicited order from informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure in five states . <p> As interest in low-fat foods grew , selling the chips got easier . Nevertheless , Westbrook had taken to writing unprofitable orders , and , Foreman says , he made few of the calls expected of him . As Westbrook 's to-do list lengthened , so did his string of broken promises . <p> Foreman kept busy , though . In addition to filling and billing orders and managing his partner 's behavior , Foreman was looking for money to fund a $350,000 chip factory that would dramatically reduce costs while lifting production from less than $20,000 a month to an estimated $600,000 . He 'd uncovered several options , including a deal to make private-label chips for a California company , but financing growth out of profits seemed prohibitively slow . <p> Sales for 1990 had reached a profitless $200,000 , and the company 's meager assets amounted to a heat-sealing gun , a bagging machine , and an oven . But Guiltless did have a product with expanding market demand , a jump on the competition , a catchy name , decent graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole shebang was worth a million bucks . <p> At a dollar a share , he could sell 35% of the stock to raise the $350,000 . And he would go even-steven with Westbrook . " We would each have 30% and control the company by voting together . " Foreman valued their friendship . " What can I say ? I was a nice guy . " Five percent of the stock was held by people who had bailed them out of cash-flow , accounting , and legal binds . <p> <p> SINCE 1976 , JOHN KOERNER AND John Oudt had been the 50-50 co-owners of Barq 's Rootbeer Inc . They had raised Barq 's from 16th to second place in the market . The market for Barq 's root beer had matured , and Koerner and Oudt were ready to diversify . They were willing to bet on a nascent low-fat-snack-food trend , no matter how the chips tasted . " Diet sodas tasted awful when they were first introduced , too , " says Oudt , who envisions a Barq's-Guiltless Gourmet relationship like the Pepsico-Frito-Lay marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than investing corporately through Barq 's , Koerner and Oudt made individual investments . But no one from Guiltless Gourmet  --  including its lawyer , Winston Krause  --  was aware that Koerner and Oudt 's goal was eventually to merge Guiltless Gourmet into Barq 's . Krause , who questioned their commitment , says , " I called and begged Koerner for an exit strategy , and they said , We are in it for the long term . ' " Foreman agrees : " As far as I knew , this original arrangement was forever . " <p> Koerner and Oudt had no illusions about the Westbrook-Foreman partnership . Oudt says , " We saw the potential for shifting ownership in the future and decided to take what we could get at the time . " To that end , Oudt , who has a law degree , and Koerner added some nifty terms to the Guiltless bylaws . For Foreman the impact of those addenda was overshadowed by the mountain of cash the company so desperately needed . Impatient with any delay , he yielded on every sticking point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-person board . Only a few decisions  --  issuance of capital stock , loans to corporations , purchases of major assets , and amendments to the bylaws  --  required a unanimous vote by the three board members . Everything else , including management of such mundane concerns as compensation , hiring and firing key managers , or signing joint-venture and licensing agreements called for a two-thirds majority . However , such strategic decisions as mergers , sale of company assets , and changes to the articles of incorporation needed two-thirds of the voting shares . To gain their second seat on the board , Koerner and Oudt needed to control just 51% of the stock . They further amended the shareholder buy-sell agreement with a pro rata purchase plan that would divvy up the shares of a selling shareholder in accordance with the current holdings of interested shareholders . The cumulative effect of that legal fine print added up to a powerful acquisition strategy . <p> <p> WITH THE INFUSION OF CAPITAL , Foreman negotiated a lease for the new chip factory , purchased equipment , and started to research new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national sales organization and a customer-service department . <p> Business responded as Foreman had predicted , and by September , with the chip factory up and running , monthly sales were up to $370,000 . But Westbrook 's deals on cocktail napkins and failure to inform headquarters frustrated efforts to fill and deliver orders . Westbrook explains , " I was taking orders any way I could get them . " But Foreman says , " We 'd send out an invoice and be expecting $10,000 , and we would get a check for a drastically different number . " Westbrook could n't be found to straighten things out , and he refused to use the official sales order form that had been designed to eliminate the troublesome napkin agreements . Worse , the national network of distributors and regional sales managers was way behind schedule , and customer service had n't developed beyond triage . Foreman remembers that it was increasingly difficult to cover up for his friend . But Westbrook contends he fulfilled his mission . " During the three years I was with Guiltless , I almost single-handedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annualized basis , " he says . <p> " We played marriage counselor for them , " Oudt says . But by April 1992 it was evident to all but Westbrook that Guiltless Gourmet could no longer afford to subsidize his shortcomings . " There are some partnerships , " Oudt adds , " that ca n't be saved . " <p> At Foreman 's suggestion , Westbrook took a six-week leave of absence . While he was gone , Foreman reports , " a wonderful calm came over the organization " that made it crystal clear he had to fire Westbrook . He was prepared to vote with Koerner and Oudt and against Westbrook if need be . But it never occurred to him that Westbrook might sell his increasingly valuable stock . His decision to liquidate his holdings would activate the buy-sell agreement 's pro-rata-purchase term and give Koerner and Oudt the opportunity to control more than 50% of Guiltless Gourmet stock . <p> <p> IN JULY 1993 FOREMAN LEARNED that Westbrook had negotiated a price of $10 per share with Koerner and Oudt . Foreman and Krause had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional stock . To avoid forfeiting his entitlement , Foreman had to scramble to borrow $1.28 million to buy his portion of Westbrook 's stock , 128,000 shares . " It 's hard for me to feel sorry for Drew , " Foreman concludes . " What he got is not a bad return on $6,500 and two years of selling . " <p> It must sting to see a stable partnership profit from the Guiltless failure . But even Foreman vouches that Koerner and Oudt honestly tried to get Westbrook out of his funk . These days Foreman is proving to Koerner and Oudt that he is up to the task of growing Guiltless Gourmet . Their two board seats and 52% ownership make their approval crucial , but Foreman comforts himself with the knowledge that he is protected by Koerner and Oudt 's bylaw addenda . They 'll need his vote for a merger . " Hey , if I grow this company and Barq 's wants to buy me out , that 's a possibility I 'm comfortable with , " says Foreman .
