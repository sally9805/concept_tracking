First it was , Who Killed Laura Palmer ? Now the big question is , Who Shot Agent Dale Cooper ? But with Twin Peaks adjourned for the summer , the networks are pondering another , even deeper mystery . For help , they have called in Agent Cooper himself . We pick him up as he drives into a new town , dictating into his omnipresent tape recorder : <P> Diane , it 's 10:05 a.m. , and I 've just arrived in New York City . What a place ! Just smell those skyscrapers . Had breakfast at a little deli on Ninth Avenue . Cheese Danish and a cup of coffee , black as a moonless night . Hit the spot . Now I 'm looking for a place to stay  --  clean place , reasonably priced . Ca n't find one . <P> Something strange is lurking beneath the seemingly normal surface of this big-city life . Oh , there 's the usual flurry of activity at the end of the TV season : fall schedules being announced , old shows getting canceled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark secrets . <P> It 's the ratings , Diane . No , not just ABC vs . CBS vs . NBC . Since January there has been a dramatic and inexplicable falloff in all TV viewing . Overall and for the demographic group that advertisers value most : adults between 18 and 49 . Worse , the news comes just when the networks are getting ready to sell commercial spots for the fall season . <P> The investigation started before I got here . The networks are blaming the dropoff on flaws in the way Nielsen measures the audience . They point to a discrepancy between the national figures and separate local ratings that Nielsen took in February . <P> Here 's where it gets interesting , Diane . Nielsen used to depend on diaries and household meters to measure national viewership . But in September 1987 the company switched to people meters . These devices , currently in 4,000 homes , require every member of the household to push a button whenever he or she starts watching TV . Ad executives love people meters because they can tabulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the networks do n't trust the gadgets , mainly because they show fewer people are watching network TV than the old system did . <P> Network researchers suggest that viewers are just getting tired of pushing those buttons . Crazier things have happened . In 1975 Nielsen showed another alarming drop in viewership . Turned out the problem was the glue attaching the meters to the TV set . As the sets heated up , the glue cracked and the meters disconnected . <P> Nielsen is standing firm . We 've checked out the people meters , they say , and found no methodological problems . " We 've been at this long enough to be able to reach the conclusion that the audience decline is a real one , " says a top Nielsen executive , William Jacobi . Still , the company is continuing to study the mystery and will issue a new report in the next week or so . <P> The networks are n't happy . If the missing viewers ca n't be found , they stand to lose hundreds of millions in ad revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just at the time we need more precision , we have a methodology that seems to be providing more volatility.
