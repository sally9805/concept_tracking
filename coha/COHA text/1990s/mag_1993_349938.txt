It was a night to remember last May at the Italian restaurant Bice in downtown Tokyo . The room was agog because among the diners were two middle-aged men , one burly , the other downright fat . They sat around jawing about sports  --  soccer , tennis , Formula 1 auto racing . At one point they turned to chat about fashion with a neighboring party of awed Italians . The cause of the stir was that the two amiable gents were the world 's most famous opera singers and among the richest and best-known entertainers in any field : Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti . <P> Much ink has been spilled in the press about a supposed enmity between the two superstars . It is n't so . As Domingo puts it , " We are friends  --  and rivals . " The astonishing thing is that two such careers should blossom at the same time . This is the Golden Age of the tenors ' art  --  to be savored because both men are in their 50s and no successors close to their caliber are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schmooze session  --  notably during the 1990 World Cup soccer finals in Rome , where they were joined by Jose Carreras in what might be called the tenor superbowl . The CD of that event has been on the charts for three years , selling an unheard of 8.1 million copies . On Sept. 27 , onstage at New York City 's Metropolitan Opera , Pavarotti and Domingo will meet again : for a gala opening night , celebrating their common 25th anniversary at the Met . ( In 1968 Domingo made his debut in Adriana Lecouvreur , Pavarotti in La Boheme . ) The Met 's jubilee sounds like an inspired negotiation . Domingo , who lately has been turning to the German repertory , will lead off singing the first act of Die Walkure . Then comes Pavarotti in the first act of Otello , new for him , though it is Domingo 's signature role . The finale will feature both men in the third act of Il Trovatore , with its famous double-barreled tenor aria . <P> The event , to be on the radio internationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenors have no firmer fan than their maestro for the evening , Met music director James Levine . He bridles when critics chant the over-the-hill blues  --  that Domingo has lost his top notes or that Pavarotti phones in the arias . Says Levine : " When Pavarotti sings L'Elisir d'Amore with such youth and spontaneity or Domingo explores the depths of Parsifal , now that is artistry . " <P> In addition to consistent quality , the Spaniard Domingo and the Italian Pavarotti have some other things in common  --  among them sound technique and astute judgment in knowing what to sing and , more important , what to avoid . Technically , both are masters of breath control ; both know how to " mark , " that is , rehearse at half-voice and still give the conductor an exact idea of how their performance will sound at full volume . Singers who ca n't do that wear themselves out in preparation . Just as important , both have a personality that draws crowds , and both command a larger-than-life persona that turns fans into true believers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conservatively estimated at more than $25 million . Pavarotti 's commercial success is probably unparalleled by any classical artist in history . His fee for a single outdoor gig is several hundred thousand dollars . ( By comparison , for a night at the Met each gets a mere $12,000. )
