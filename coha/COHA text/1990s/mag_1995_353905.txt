EVEN WITH ALL THE HOOPLA ABOUT COLIN POWELL LAST WEEK , IT WAS THE silences that were most impressive . Powell told ABC 's Barbara Walters he favored gun control , but the National Rifle Association fired no rhetorical shot in reply . Powell said he favored abortion rights and was less than enthusiastic about promoting school prayer . Yet Ralph Reed , executive director of the conservative Christian Coalition , declined invitations to appear on TV to criticize him . Although he disagrees with Powell on those issues , Reed says , " There is a deep reservoir of admiration for Powell based on the integrity and rectitude of his own personal life . " <P> The general has become the nitroglycerin of the 1996 presidential contest . Virtually no one wants to jostle him out of fear that his popularity  --  and any slighting of his person  --  could prove explosive . Powell 's admirers say his appeal revolves around leadership rather than litmus tests , and polls support that idea . A TIME/CNN survey , taken after Powell proclaimed his moderate-to-liberal social views , indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would win 33% of the vote , against President Clinton 's 30% and Senator Bob Dole 's 24% . <P> As a result , Powell has become the man to see . At least six Republican Governors have asked for meetings with him when he comes to their states during his current book tour . Political consultants , media advisers and campaign pollsters have inundated Powell 's inner circle of friends with professional entreaties . And G.O.P. presidential hopeful Pete Wilson made a secret pilgrimage to Powell 's Virginia mansion on Sept. 6 to have coffee with him , even after Wilson was told Powell had only half an hour to spare and would not answer the central question : Will he run ? His deadline for that decision appears to be Thanksgiving , and he is leaning toward running as a Republican . In that scenario , the TIME/CNN poll showed that Powell would trounce Clinton , 46% to 38% . <P> This is not to say Powell made only friends . A few conservatives are complaining bitterly . Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council says that among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment . " The antiabortion Christian Defense Coalition plans protests outside Powell book signings around the country . <P> Still , most Republicans who might have been offended by Powell 's opinions remain complimentary . Words of praise came last week from Jack Kemp and William Kristol . Even House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is toying with the idea of entering the race , says that Powell could be a strong contender in the Republican primaries because of his standing as a war hero , an economic conservative and a person with strong family values . Says Gingrich : " I do n't think a social moderate will necessarily lose the Republican primaries . Powell could put together a very interesting coalition . " <P> Some prominent Democrats , including a key associate of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , are also privately urging Powell to consider running against Clinton in their primaries . Powell , they reason , might give the party a better chance of retaining the White House . The White House reacted by scoffing at some Powell comments . Press secretary Mike McCurry derided Powell 's left-leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlen Specter doing that well . "
