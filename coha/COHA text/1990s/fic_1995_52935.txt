Overnight , the population of the city doubled . But nobody new moved in . <p> When Iris woke , there were two other people in her bed , and she 'd gone to sleep alone . She felt hot , sweaty , crowded , and alarmed ; waking with someone next to her was not something she was used to , even in the still-unfamiliar svelte shape she 'd worked so hard to achieve and maintain . She still did n't believe anyone could look at her first thing in the morning and feel friendly toward her , so she usually kept people from spending the night . <p> The blackout curtains she used because daylight disturbed her sleep were doing their job ; the only light in the room came from her digital clock 's red numbers . The clock had n't alarmed ; it was only 6 A.M. , and she would n't have to get ready for work for half an hour yet . The warmth of other bodies had wakened her . She did n't know what to be afraid of yet : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ? Or Timothy , her new boyfriend , who had a key to the apartment and had never used it ? Would he bring a friend ? In a state of suspended fear and acute discomfort , she sat up and reached across one body for the switch of the lamp on the bedside table . <p> Yellow light touched the pink quilt , which was humped in three places : a big hump between her and the light , her own legs , and a smaller hump on her right . There were two fuzzy heads on the pillows , one to either side of her , faces down so all she saw was messy hair the mousebrown color of her own . Her sisters ? But she only had one sister , a redhead . She touched the head of the bigger lump , and it turned over and she saw her own face , sleepy and broad , fat-cheeked , smiling as it had never smiled in a mirror in all the years she had worn it . Its narrow eyes opened , glinting green at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering machine 's message . " We came home . " <p> " What ? " <p> The little lump stirred now , rolled over , stuck skinny arms up to stretch . It , too , wore her face , only smaller . Not younger . Herself in miniature , and gaunt , thinner than she had ever been ; she had spent her childhood as a dumpling , going from cute baby to distressingly plump child . <p> " We came home , " repeated her fat self . <p> " From where ? ' <p> " From wherever things go when they 're lost . We found our way home . " Her fat self sat up , the covers sliding down to reveal pale breasts with brown aureoles , stretch marks lacing the breasts like rivers of white lightning . <p> " This is n't your home , " said Iris . " Get out of here ! Go back where you came from . " <p> " Do n't you understand ? That 's why we 're here . " Fat Self held out arms whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinched shut in a delighted smile , hugged Iris . " We love you , " she said . <p> " Leave me alone ! " Iris screamed . She punched at the other woman , and her fist sank into a pillowing , welcoming belly . Fat Self giggled . <p> The little self was tugging at Iris 's nightgown with fingers thin as claws . " Give me , give me , " she said in a thread of voice . <p> " Give you what ! " Iris struggled in the grip of Fat Self , who finally released her . She turned to look at the little self and saw eyes wide and full of pain . <p> " More me , " said Little Self . It reached out and pinched at her sit-ups-flattened stomach . " More , " it whispered . " More . " <p> Its pinching was strong . It hurt . Iris slapped its hand away . Its too-wise eyes stared at her . <p> " Get out of here ! " Iris yelled . She shoved at both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one grabbed one of her wrists and held on . They were both strong . She tried to jerk away from them , but they did n't let go or even show a sign of strain . She thrashed with her legs . All she accomplished was a stirring of the covers . " Let go of me ! " <p> " We let go of you once . We wo n't do it again , " said Fat Self . <p> " Eat , " said Little Self , and it and Fat Self worked together to get her out of bed and into the kitchen . Little Self tied her to a chair with clothesline , and Fat Self cooked pancakes . The kitchen smelled of sizzling butter , and flour marrying eggs and milk . Little Self got out the ice cream Iris had hidden in the tiny freezer compartment , the secret shame she could n't resist , even though she had been dieting and exercising rigorously for five years . She still cheated some nights when the loneliness overwhelmed her . Mornings after those nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories . <p> Now Little Self was holding out a spoonful of chocolate mint . Iris heard her stomach growl . She opened her mouth . <p> Little Self fed her , gently , without spilling anything . They had just reached the bottom of the carton when Fat Self set a plate full of pancakes drowning in butter and Tim 's syrup on the table in front of her , and sat down in the extra chair , which complained . Fat Self smiled and cut the pancakes into bite-sized wedges , then fed them to Iris . The pancakes were light and fluffy , and the syrup was so sweet , a taste she had been denying herself . <p> Iris remembered being very small . Urna , the maid , had fed her then , making the food swoop and fly before it came to rest in her mouth . " Little frog , little frog , " whispered Urna , " here is your supper . Be very clever and catch it before it flies away ! " <p> " Little frog , little frog , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and then swooped into her mouth . She chewed , swallowed , and laughed , losing herself in the game of eating . <p> The alarm in the bedroom went off . <p> Iris tried to stand , but Little Self held the chair down . " Never mind , " said Little Self , " You have other work to do today . " <p> " Why  --  " Iris began , but as soon as she opened her mouth , Fat Self fed her . She turned her head away and swallowed . " Why do n't you eat for yourself ? " she managed to say before another mouthful of pancakes attacked . <p> " We ca n't , " said Fat Self . " That 's not what we are . " <p> " What are you ? " whispered Iris . <p> Fat Self giggled and fed her pancakes until she could n't eat any more . <p> Iris felt tired and sleepy after breakfast , so full she could hardly move . Little Self untied her , and both selves escorted her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing she heard before spiraling down into deep sleep was Fat Self on the phone , telling someone she was too sick to come to work today . <p> When she woke , she felt bloated and ill . The clock told her it was one in the afternoon . She struggled up and opened the curtains to look out at a blast furnace day , sun baking the pale wall of the building across from hers . The street nine stories below shimmered with heat . She fell back onto the bed , her hands on her swollen stomach . She had been so careful to eat small meals , her stomach could n't deal with big ones . Had that morning 's breakfast been a dream ? Rationalization for a binge ? She went into the bathroom to throw up , and was on the floor , leaning over the toilet , when a hand closed over her mouth . " Not that way , " said Little Self . " It has to go through you so I can get it . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put it on , then work it off . That 's the only way I can grow . " <p> Her stomach churned . She vomited before Little Self could stop her , and sat back , breathing deeply , stomach acids etching her tongue and throat . <p> " All right , " said Little Self , " I guess we 're doing this wrong . You need to build back up to it a little at a time . " Little Self went and got a glass of water and gave it to Iris . She rinsed out her mouth and spat into the toilet . Little Self flushed it . <p> When she woke later , one of them had gone shopping , and there were all her favorite foods in the house again , junk she had learned to stay away from and despise : Cheetos and Twinkies , ice cream and devilsfood cake , potato chips and licorice whips , and all the breads  --  sourdough , hearth rye , raisin bread  --  and real dairy butter to go on top , and raspberry preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scents of childhood foods , the ones that took revenge on you for eating them by huddling under the skin , moving in like houseguests who refused to leave . <p> Fat Self fixed her a salad , and she felt comforted by it ; surely a salad could feed them nothing . Maybe it even canceled out some of the destruction they were practicing . She tried to hold onto that thought while they were forcing her to eat the deep-fat-fried chicken with the skin still on , crackly and spicy . <p> Iris closed her teeth against invasion . Fat Self stroked her cheek and murmured , " Little frog , little frog , " and Iris felt her mouth open . The eating was hypnotic . She felt confusion as she ate , one part of her enjoying the experience as if she were young and being cared for , another part of her protesting every bite , screaming in horror at what this forced feeding was doing to her carefully established control , and another , more primitive part full of a hunger so deep that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they finished feeding her she felt only a little bloated . The two selves escorted her into the living room and turned on the television . After half an hour of some inane rerun , Fat Self took Iris 's arm and led her over to the Exercycle . With deep relief , Iris started cycling . Little Self adjusted the tension on the bike so that it was harder to pedal than Iris was used to , but she pushed and pumped till the sweat soaked through her nightgown and rolled down her face . Here was something she could control . <p> When at last she stopped , her arms and legs aching with fatigue , her seat almost as sore as it had been the first time she used the bike , Fat Self drew her into the bathroom and gave her a bath , soaping and sponging and rinsing her with strong , gentle hands . Iris was too tired to help . The warm water relaxed her . With her eyes closed , she could imagine she was a little girl again and Mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath was over . <p> They never let her leave the house . She did n't understand how they were handling her job . It seemed that one or the other of them must be going to work , because there was enough money for rent and groceries . Usually when Iris was awake both of them were home , but she realized , even though they had taken away the clock , that they had shifted her schedule so that she slept during the day ; maybe while she slept one of her other selves answered the phones , screened the applicants , and filed all the papers generated by Charisma , Incorporated . Somebody must be doing it . <p> She was relieved it was no longer her . <p> * * * Little Self grew steadily bigger . Her cheeks rounded , and flesh showed on her bones . The day came when Iris woke to discover twin Fat Self cooking dinner for her  --  Stroganoff lush with sour cream , potatoes holding lakes of butter , salad clothed in ranch dressing , and cherry cobbler for dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . " Have n't I done enough for you now ? " she asked . " Ca n't I get back to eating the way I want , living the way I want ? " <p> They patted her shoulder . She took this as acquiescence and pushed her plate away , but one shook her head , making a tsk tsk tsk sound , and the other went to the drawer and got out the clothesline , showing it to her . <p> Iris 's throat tightened . She took a gulp of wine to loosen it and dug into her dinner . Both selves beamed at her . She could no longer tell them apart . <p> In the morning there was a new scrawny starved self in the bed with the rest of them , and it was crying . <p> Overnight , the population of the city expanded . Trails of crumbs led the lost home . <p> ILLUSTRATION : EUPHEMISM <p> <p> By Nina Kiriki Hoffman <p> Nina Kiriki Hoffman 's first solo novel , The Thread that Binds the Bones , won the Bram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel appears .
