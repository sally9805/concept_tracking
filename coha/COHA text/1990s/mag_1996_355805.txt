Whether it succeeds or fails , the CBS sitcom Ink ( Monday , 8:30 p.m . ET ) will be remembered for inspiring one of the most refreshing bursts of candor in television history . When the pilot episode for the Ted Danson-Mary Steenburgen comedy was finished , the people involved could scarcely contain their lack of enthusiasm . Danson , at a press conference , said he did n't want to " disclaim the baby " but promised the show would improve . Steenburgen likened the series to making a batch of pancakes : sometimes " you throw out the first . " A few weeks later CBS tossed out all four episodes completed up to that point , fired the producer and delayed the premiere for a month so the show could be retooled . Said CBS Entertainment chief Leslie Moonves : " It is better to do it right than do it fast . " <P> They still did it fast . Diane English , the creator of Murphy Brown , was brought in as executive producer , and she scrapped virtually everything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the basic premise  --  a divorced couple working together at a New York City newspaper . The show was rebuilt from scratch in just five weeks , starting with a brainstorming session that English convened with a handful of writers on Martha 's Vineyard . " I flew in the day after Hurricane Eduoard and flew out the day before Hurricane Hortense hit , " she says . " We thought it was very symbolic . " <P> And it turns out they did it right : Ink does n't stink . The first version was a strained attempt at something resembling ' 30s screwball comedy : Danson and Steenburgen finalized their divorce in the opening scene and were back at adjoining desks the very same day ; when Steenburgen offered to quit , she was made managing editor instead . Even if the setup had been more plausible , the show proved how unfriendly TV is to stylized screwball comedy . Viewers do n't want to be distanced by brittle , rat-a-tat comedy patter ; they want comfortable characters they can relate to . <P> Ink II provides them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been divorced for 10 years ( with a 15-year-old daughter ) but are thrown back together when she is hired as the managing editor of the paper where he 's a star columnist . " Have you seen the buses ? " he boasts to his ex-wife . " I 'm on the M4 , the M10  --  and the 6 . That 's crosstown , baby . " She 's a high-strung but determined professional woman trying to give up smoking ; he pesters their daughter to find out whom her mom is dating . Next headline : ROMANTIC TENSION BREWING . <P> Danson , with his mix of insouciance and egotism , is in peak form  --  trying , for example , to foment a rebellion among his co-workers against " Evita in there " after they 've been thoroughly snowed by their new boss . Steenburgen needs to spend a few hours at the word processor before she 'll convince us that she belongs inside a newsroom , but she plays off him well . The secondary characters are better than their pilot predecessors as well , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Saul Rubinek ) are n't pushed on us too hard . The one exception is Christine Ebersole as a brassy nightlife reporter who 's been to one too many charity soirees ; but since she also has the funniest entrance of the show ( maybe of the season ) , she 's excused . Ink is now a workplace comedy that really works .
