Section : The American Illustrators Hall of Fame Leave the household chores for the day and come along to the Greatest Show on Earth , as seen through the talent of America 's greatest illustrators . <p> " Summer pleasures , they are gone like to visions every one/And the cloudy days of autumn and winter cometh on . " Thus wrote one autumn-wary poet . <p> One of those summer pleasures he surely had in mind would have been the yearly event of the circus coming to town , with excitement enough to brighten those cloudy days ahead with rays of pleasant memories . <p> The big top , however , never made it to some smaller towns . Thus the thought occurs that you might have been deprived of this unforgettable entertainment as a child . Or , perhaps , you were born too late and missed that golden circus era altogether <p> On this assumption , our Post Hall of Fame illustrators now bring these postponed pleasures to you , not in the big top but on their own type of canvas : Putting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crazy clowns with their funny faces and zany stunts . The tightrope walker that sends a boy home to break his neck trying to imitate him . <p> Yes , it 's all here , folks . Step right inside . Do n't push . There 's room for all . <p> How about some cotton candy or pink lemonade while you wait ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : For absence of pulse-throbbing excitement , a circus without clowns compares favorably with holding hands while wearing leather gloves . Cover artist John Atherton does not leave Post readers to question whether this is the face that launched a thousand ships . His face instead launched thousands of laughs  --  at a time ( during World War II ) when laughs were in short supply the world over . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Artist Stevan Dohanos chose for his circus cover of August 4 , 1945 , two Ringling Bros. and Barnum &; Bailey billboard posters at work , and too busy to keep a wary eye on the cows , should they try to horn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste pot , she might require a little more time for milking that night . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lest there be confusion , those are not the Ringling brothers in front , Barnum and Bailey behind , or a world-renowned aerial artist being borne to center ring . Should doubt remain , the sign suggests that sidewalk spectators come see for themselves at 2 p.m. that very day . Whose barn or garage to come to , unfortunately , has been omitted . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Water the elephant and get a free pass to the circus . A piece of cake ! Though ' t is said that all is well that ends well , artist Alan Foster seemingly has come up with a well that could bend before his dehydrated beast has drunk its fill . What the boy sees of the circus may well be the elephant act that ends it . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Right ) Fondly recalling the big parade on that great summer day when the circus came to town , artist Dohanos took brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clowning . " Circuses do n't parade much anymore , " he complained , " but I think it 's a grand old custom . " The dentist in the window appears to be pulling for them , too . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : We can almost hear the barker 's spiel : " Circus today at three o'clock . Come see the strong man in action ... this tower of strength ... Goliath ... Sampson ... Atlas ... all rolled into one mighty body ! You 'll be amazed ! You 'll go home vowing to begin exercising this very day ! " And if that grapefruit should slip , the boy could very well be going home that very day by a back route . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Left ) This scene did n't just fall into artist Dohanos ' lap . He had the beam rigged and borrowed the boy to try his hand ( or foot ) at duplicating the circus act . But keep your eye on the eggs in the nest to the left . They were deposited during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the chicken never returned , Dohanos believed she wanted to leave a little of herself to appear on a Post cover . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Samuel Johnson wrote about " creatures ... that produce laughter , like dancing dogs . " Whether this dog includes dancing in his act , we are left to imagine . But the artist leaves little doubt that the dog is saying to his master , " How 'm I doin ' ? " Or perhaps , " How about where I balance that bratwurst on my nose and then catch it before it hits the ground ? I never get tired of that one .
