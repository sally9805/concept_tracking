Two intrepid groups of dreamers attempt to recreate the world 's most famous ship . // It is truly a titanic endeavor . Tempting the fates , two newly formed shipping companies hope to revive the golden age of the transatlantic passenger liner by building full-scale replicas of the Titanic . The keel of the frist ship could belaid as early as this month , in Durban , South Africa . If the work steams ahead on schedule , the replica 's owner , RMS Titanic Shipping Holdings of Durban , could welcome passengers aboard for a Dec. 29 , 1999 , maiden voyage . About hvo years later , a second replica proposed by White Star Line Limited of Basel , Switzerland-a new company unrelated to the original White Star Line-could begin her maiden voyage . Both transatlantic crossings will be largely ceremonial . After retracing-and hopefully completing-the Titanic 's interrupted journey from Southampton , England , to New York City , thev will head for southern waters to begin careers as vacation cruise liners . A Titanic Obstacle Creating floating steel palaces worths of their namesake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wolff , the Titaiiic 's builders . The biggest problem is the Titanic herself . After the 46,000-ton ship slid beneath the sea on April 15 , 1912 , killing 1523 , the seafaring nations tightened passenger ship construction and safety regulations , " There is no way you could rebuild the original Titanic , " captain Christopher McMahon of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in King 's Point , N.Y. , tells POPULAR MECHANICS . " They the replicas may look like the Titanic , but they wo n't be the Titanic . " Even the Titanic 's sister ship , the Britannic-under construction at the time of the disaster-could n't be built to the original plans . And it 's older sister , the Olympic , was put into dry dock for a major overhaul that included massive structural changes . Photograph Photograph // Even if some sort of special exemption could be granted to allow construction of a down-to-the-rivet replica , it is questionable how many passengers would be willing to pay $30,612 to $382,650 to spend four to five days tossing about the Atlantic on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition . The Britannic , which served as a World War I hospital ship , sank after it hit a mine , and suffered similar damage to the Titanic . Thirty of the 1100 on board died . Sarel Gous , managing director of the South African project , acknowledges that there will be differences . " Our Titanic will look identical to the original , but of course with the latest safety technology , " he says . Steel Dreams The two would-be replica builders were still negotiating with naval arcitects and shipyards when PM went to press . So we asked Neil Gallagher of Webb Institute in Glen Cove , N.Y. , the country 's foremost school for naval architects , how closely the replicas were likely to mimic the original . It depends how close you look , he said , because the great ship 's most distinctive features will have to be faked . Not the fakery is new to the Titanic name . In her era , the Titanic 's most distinctive features were her four proudly raked funnels . Actually , only the three nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was added to make her look , well , titanic . Both replicas will have four funnels . However , all will be ornamental because the modern ships wo n't have steam engines . " I doubt you would find anyone who would build a reciprocating steam enginge , " said Gallagher . The same holds true for the Titanic 's boldly riveted hull . Once again it is n't simply a matter of finding skilled labor . Today 's ship hulls are welded . The shape of the hull will also need to change . " The hull design of the Titanic was pretty good for its day , " said Gallagher . He quickly added that the same design could spell economic ruin in today 's highly competitive cruise-ship industry . The biggest change will occur just below the waterline , where the ships could be fitted with a bulbous protrusion that prevents the formation of an energy-robbing bow wave , explained Gallagher . This , in turn , will improve fuel economy by about 4% . That is the equivalent of a free fill-up for every 26th transatlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the replicas will do when they arrive in port . While the Titanic 's 159 furnaces burned 825 tons of coal a day , the replicas will sip diesel fuel . " They will probably use diesel generators so they can provide electricity for both propulsion and what we call a " hotel load ' ' , " said Gallagher . Modem cruise ships are , in fact , floating hotels . To keep passengers happy as they tour tropical climates will require , among other things , air conditioning , more than double the three passenger elevators on the Titanic , and enough current to power all the hair dryers that will be turned on a half-hour before each dinner seating . Photograph Inside The New Titanic // " The beauty of multiple diesel generators is that you can redirect the power from propulsion to the hotel load as needed , " said Gallagher . In the space occupied by about five of the Titanic 's 29 boilers , the replica 's five diesel generators will crank out enough power for the ship 's electric motors and today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free up lots of space , but pose another design problem . Weighing less than the original , the - replicas will ride higher in the water . This , said Gallagher , will make them less stable . " They would probably need a permanent or sea water ballast , " he said . Photograph The Titanic was not only the largest ship of its day but also the most elegant Replicas of its furniture , like the ship itself , will have to be updated , chiefly by using woods , upholstery and carpeting that meet today 's safety standards . The builders of the South African replica say that for added authenticity , the furnishings for its ship will be made in England // Ship owners will also have to worry more about what comes out of the cabins . In the Titanic 's day garbage and waste , sanitary and bilge water were simply thrown overboard . McMahon says that to meet U.S. Coast Guard regulations the replicas will need modern sewage treatment plants and garbage compactors to store solid waste until it can be trucked away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shipping , an organization that certifies the structural and mechanical fitness of ships , says that although the replica projects face substantial challenges , the problems are all solvable , for a price . Project backers have placed the cost of their ships between $400 million and $600 million , about twice as much per passenger as modern cruise liners , estimates McMahon . Annette D. Volcker , of the White Star Line , believes the expense will be worth it . " We are giving back to sea travel what it has lost in modern times-an air of magnificent elegance .
