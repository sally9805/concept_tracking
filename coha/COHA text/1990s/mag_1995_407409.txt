How to bond through a special way to play It began as the story of a family in crisis . And it was their youngest , an 11-month-old boy , who was tearing them apart . He had n't napped at all as a baby . Now , a healthy , active  --  but exhausted  --  toddler , he was unable to let himself go and fall into the sleep he so desperately needed . For days on end he just walked around the house wailing . And then came the nights . Eight , nine , ten times he would awaken , screaming , bouncing around his crib like a little pinball . He resisted his parents ' attempts to soothe him , nor could he put himself to sleep . The family doctor proved unhelpful  --  she said he would just grow out of it . But he did n't . His parents tried every technique in every book they could get their hands on . But nothing worked , and month after month , the exhaustion and frustration wore on . " We were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother . " I was ready to walk out because I just could n't cope with him anymore . " But she did n't walk out . Instead the family got help . Now , six months later , this same toddler is sleeping through from 7:30 at night to six in the morning . He naps two hours each morning and two hours each afternoon . He 's a happy , thriving child ; the apple of his mother 's eye . " I just adore him , " she says , " and I never ever thought I 'd reach that point . He 's just wonderful . It 's like having a new baby . I ca n't get enough of this kid . " What was the miracle that gave Catherine Hollett back her son Callum ? She began to play with him as part of a program called " Watch , Wait and Wonder " at Toronto 's Hincks Centre for Children 's Mental Health . The program is geared to mothers and babies who are experiencing difficulties in their relationship . Through play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in her parenting role , and learns how to sort out the problems between them . Fathers are usually involved in the assessment and review process . When I look back now I think we had nothing between us , " says Hollett . " Callum and I were non-connected . " Problems with sleeping had developed over time into problems of attachment between mother and son . But as Hollett came to realize in her discussions with psychotherapist Elizabeth Muir , her shaky start with Callum began even before his birth  --  a rough pregnancy , an extremely stressful delivery , tensions about the new baby being a threat to her relationship with her first-born and the additional day-to-day burden of dealing with a newborn . Nothing extraordinary here  --  Hollett 's experiences and concerns are shared by lots of parents . But when Callum proved to be a " difficult " baby  --  sleeping poorly , unaffectionate  --  the problems seemed insurmountable . PLAY it 's how babies learn about the world , says Penelope Leach in her classic Your Baby and Child , and how they practise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses to explore their environment ; what we as parents do is try to stimulate and encourage their activities in a pleasurable way . We initiate playtime with our babies by handing them a toy . " Shake the rattle . Yes ! Can you hear it ? " We show them how to play with the toy . " You put the puzzle piece in here . That 's right ! Good girl . " We teach them songs and rhymes and counting and the alphabet . " This little piggy went to market , this little piggy stayed home ... " It 's play that 's fun for our children and for us . Researchers at the Hincks call this kind of play " reactive play . " Parent-initiated and goal-oriented , it is the most common kind of play . By teaching our kids about the world we feel as though we 're doing our job as parents . And we are . But there is another way to play and that is what Catherine Hollett and Callum learned together at the Hincks . It was this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between baby and mother . Follow the child " sums up the Watch , Wait and Wonder way to play . The mother puts her own agenda aside  --  how she thinks she should be playing , her ideas of mothering , how she was mothered herself  --  and gets down on the floor and lets her baby lead the play . The environment at the Hincks  --  quiet , comfortable floor , childproof  --  is helpful . So are the open-ended toys that lead to imaginative play : family puppets and figures , jungle and farm animals , balls , bean bags and pillows , cars , stuffed toys , blocks , dressup clothes , medical kits , dolls of both sexes with diapers , bottles and cribs . It gave us special time together , " explains Hollett . " We learned how to relax around each other . I learned how he played and I enjoyed watching him . I learned how to finally see him as something other than the monster who would n't sleep . I started enjoying him . " When Elizabeth Muir began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a decade ago , a mother participating in the program gave permission for sessions between her and her son to be filmed . It 's painful to watch their first playtime  --  the baby avoiding contact with the mother ; the mother full of " no , no , no 's " in her interaction with her baby . But what a change by the sixth session ! They are making eye contact , touching each other , the mother is waiting for the child to initiate the play , she 's listening to what he 's saying and echoing his words . " He was n't my baby before , " we hear her say , " but now he is . " So how does this marvellous change in the relationship come about ? Muir explains it this way : " The baby is allowed to experience himself as a being with some efficacy in terms of influencing the mother . This establishes a stronger sense of self . The mother is allowed time to really see her baby objectively rather than as a shadow of herself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the child is encouraged to be expressive and lead the play , while the mother is taken out of her everyday script . Families in crisis with children who have feeding , sleeping , tantrum , separation and bonding problems come for help to the Watch , Wait and Wonder program . But what about families who are not in crisis ? I think it 's a wonderful idea for a mom or dad , for a pocket of time during the day , to get down on the floor with the child and just relax and let the child take over , follow the child 's lead , " says Muir . " It lets the parent recognize that there are other ways of being with the child than having to look after him and feel anxious and in charge all the time . " Parents are anxious about doing a good enough job  --  often too much so , Muir says . But when they are able to get the program " into their guts , " she finds that this new way of being  --  accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes part of their interactions with older children in the family as well . Instead of bombarding their children with questions at the end of the school day , they let their kids come to them and really listen when they do . Instead of jumping in right away to solve their children 's problems , they let the kids struggle to come up with their own solutions . Instead of trying to be in charge all the time , they show their kids respect and let them take responsibility for their lives . If all this sounds familiar , it is  --  this powerful message has been articulated by such parenting experts as Penelope Leach , Haim Ginott , Barbara Coloroso , Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish . The Watch , Wait and Wonder way to play can lay the groundwork for positive parenting attitudes and practices that last a lifetime . Follow That Child ! Here are some tips from the therapists at the Hincks : Get on the floor with your child . Position yourself so that you can see your child 's activity ( but if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refrain from initiating play or selecting the toys your child will play with . When your child is playing or simply being , hold your urge to take over the activity . Do n't clear up after your child . She may return to play with those toys . Follow your child 's lead , which means responding when he initiates an activity with you . Fully attend to your child 's activity and let yourself become immersed in it . Stay in the moment . Accept whatever your child wishes to do and play . Remember , anything your child does is OK ( as long as no harm is being done to anyone ) . Share in your child 's satisfaction and success . Have fun ! Although this may sound easy , in practice it is quite difficult . Do n't be discouraged . Keep with it and soon you will notice the difference . To help you remember these instructions , think about the name watch , wait and wonder .
