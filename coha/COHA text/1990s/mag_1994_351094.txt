Was our cover story ( ( THE WHITE HOUSE , March 21 ) ) on the travails of Hillary Rodham Clinton unfair ? At least 70 readers support her . " Why are you endorsing this witch-hunt ? " asks Clara Beard of Los Angeles , who , like many , suspects the furor over Whitewater is " a ploy to divert attention from much needed health-care legislation . " Others agree with Huguet Pameijer of Simsbury , Connecticut , who thinks " the current bash fest " stems from the perception that the First Lady is " too accomplished , too powerful , too darn inexcusably uppity . " But some 50 readers have harsh words for Hillary . While the milder critics deem her a " political liability , " at least one person suggests aggressive action , asking , " Is there any way to impeach Hillary ? "
