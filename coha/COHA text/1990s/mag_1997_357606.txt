The scariest part about working for Bill Clinton used to be his " purple rages "  --  violent bursts of room-shaking anger that could drain the blood from the face of even the most confident aide . Back then , Clinton 's emotional engagement in his presidency could be measured by the intensity of his hair-trigger temper . <P> Which is why his response to the latest White House blunder says so much about Bill Clinton 's presidency now . Four years ago , a staff member would rather have resigned than be the one to tell the boss about the ill-timed release of the videotapes made of Clinton 's coffees with big-money donors . Yet when deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills brought him the news , first disclosed by TIME , Clinton responded in private much as he did last week in public : with frustration , but also with fatalistic detachment . " He does n't do the big temper tantrum as much as he used to , " says a senior White House official . " The undisciplined Bill Clinton of the past would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let things like that preoccupy him . " <P> That might be a relief if it also did n't reflect something more troubling : a White House without energy and a sense of purpose . Clinton 's 1997 has been slow off the ground . His initiatives on race and volunteerism have fizzled from lack of follow-up . His push to improve public education has lacked ambition : Administration officials admit they made standardized tests the centerpiece of their plan not because anyone thinks they are the most vital improvement but because they are the least expensive . And the President 's current efforts to bolster his trade-negotiating authority may have come too late to save the legislation . Even the balanced-budget deal was more an item off the President 's 1995 and 1996 checklists than a postelection new idea . Yet since midsummer , White House aides have been saying not to expect a new agenda from Clinton until his next State of the Union address in January . " We 're still not sure what a post-balanced-budget world looks like , " laments one . <P> For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a long time to spend on forging a legacy . But Clinton 's mind is elsewhere . He no longer sits in on lengthy policy bull sessions with his advisers , and he has stopped reading about new developments in the various investigations and lawsuits that nip at his Administration , preferring the occasional briefing instead . Since recovering from his knee injury , he has taken to playing golf not just on weekends , but on workday afternoons . White House press secretary Mike McCurry praises the President 's newfound balance between work and leisure , and insists Clinton 's hours on the fairways provide important " think time . " Says another top adviser : " No one can ever accuse this President of keeping Ronald Reagan hours . "
