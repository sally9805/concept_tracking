TONI CHILDS has done something tougher than just make another terrific record here . She has beat the jinx . Her debut album in 1988 , Union , was one of those comet-like appearances that occur more frequently in pop music than they do in the firmament , leaving the listener simultaneously dazzled and wondering , a bit uneasily , if she could ever do it again . Many do n't , after all . But then , it 's becoming increasingly clear that Toni Childs plays only by her own rules . HOUSE OF HOPE ( A &M); is a record about emotional battering : in love , in childhood , in marriage . The songs , mostly written and produced with the formidable David Ricketts , soar and surprise ; the lyrics have a spare astringency , which is just the right tone in which to tell these tales of burdened hearts and spirits that , against all odds and expectations , refuse to * be broken . You can hear House of Hope pouring out of the car radio this summer as Thelma and Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American pop culture . When they stop to refuel , they 'll find Childs right there . Outlaws of the heart , all of them . J.C .
