##@x <p> Following are excerpts from a commencement speech that Clarence Thomas , President Bush 's nominee to the Supreme Court , gave at Savannah State College on June 9 , 1985 . <p> I grew up here in Savannah . I was born not far from here ( in Pinpoint ) . I am a child of those marshes , a son of this soil . I am a descendant of the slaves whose labors made the dark soil of the South productive . I am the great-great-grandson of a freed slave , whose enslavement continued after my birth . I am the product of hatred and love  --  the hatred of the social and political structure which dominated the segregated , hate-filled city of my youth , and the love of some people  --  my mother , my grandparents , my neighbors and relatives  --  who said by their actions , " You can make it , but first you must endure . " <p> You can survive , but first you must endure . You can live , but first you must endure . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must endure the bigotry . You must endure the segregation . You must endure the indignities . <p> I stand before you as one who had the same beginning as yourselves  --  as one who has walked a little farther down the road , climbed a little higher up the mountain . I come back to you , who must now travel this road and climb this jagged , steep mountain that lies ahead . I return as a messenger  --  a front-runner , a scout . What lies ahead of you is even tougher than what is now behind you . <p> That mean , callous world out there is still very much filled with discrimination . It still holds out a different life for those who do not happen to be the right race or the right sex . It is a world in which the " haves " continue to reap more dividends than the " have-nots . " <p> You will enter a world in which more than one-half of all black children are born primarily to youthful mothers and out of wedlock . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always is more than double that of white teenagers . Any discrimination , like sharp turns in a road , becomes critical because of the tremendous speed at which we are traveling into the high-tech world of a service economy . <p> There is a tendency among young , upwardly mobile , intelligent minorities to forget . We forget the sweat of our forefathers . We forget the blood of the marchers , the prayers and hope of our race . We forget who brought us into this world . We overlook who put food in our mouths and clothes on our backs . We forget commitment to excellence . We procreate with pleasure and retreat from the responsibilities of the babies we produce . <p> We subdue , we seduce , but we do n't respect ourselves , our women , our babies . How do we expect a race that has been thrown into the gutter of socio-economic indicators to rise above these humiliating circumstances if we hide from responsibility for our own destiny ? <p> The truth of the matter is we have become more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities . <p> Over the past 15 years , I have watched as others have jumped quickly at the opportunity to make excuses for black Americans . It is said that blacks can not start businesses because of discrimination . But I remember businesses on East Broad and West Broad that were run in spite of bigotry . It is said that we ca n't learn because of bigotry . But I know for a fact that tens of thousands of blacks were educated at historically black colleges , in spite of discrimination . We learned to read in spite of segregated libraries . We built homes in spite of segregated neighborhoods . We learned how to play basketball ( and did we ever learn ! ) , even though we could n't go to the N.B.A. <p> We have lost something . We look for role models in all the wrong places . We refuse to reach back in our not too distant past for the lessons and values we need to carry us into the uncertain future . We ignore what has permitted blacks in this country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation . We overlook the reality of positive values and run to the mirage of promises , visions and dreams . <p> I dare not come to this city , which only two decades ago clung so tenaciously to segregation , bigotry and Jim Crowism , to convince you of the fairness of this society . My memory is too precise , my recollection too keen , to venture down that path of self-delusion . I am not blind to our history  --  nor do I turn a deaf ear to the pleas and cries of black Americans . Often I must struggle to contain my outrage at what has happened to black Americans  --  what continues to happen  --  what we let happen and what we do to ourselves . <p> If I let myself go , I would rage in the words of Frederick Douglass : " At a time like this , scorching irony , not convincing argument , is needed . Oh ! Had I the ability , and could reach the nation 's ear , I would today pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For it is not light that is needed , but fire ; it is not the gentle shower , but thunder . We need the storm , the whirlwind and the earthquake . " <p> I often hear rosy platitudes about this country  --  much of which is true . But how are we black Americans to feel when we have so little in a land with so much ? How is black America to respond to the celebration of the wonders of this great nation ? <p> In 1964 , when I entered the seminary , I was the only black in my class and one of two in the school . A year later , I was the only one in the school . Not a day passed that I was not pricked by prejudice . <p> But I had an advantage over black students and kids today . I had never heard any excuses made . Nor had I seen my role models take comfort in excuses . The women who worked in those kitchens and waited on the bus knew it was prejudice which caused their plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My grandfather knew why his business was n't more successful , but that did n't stop him from getting up at 2 in the morning to carry ice , wood and fuel oil . Sure , they knew it was bad . They knew all too well that they were held back by prejudice . But they were n't pinned down by it . They fought discrimination under W. W. Law a Georgia civil rights leader and the N.A.A.C.P. Equally important , they fought against the awful effects of prejudice by doing all they could do in spite of this obstacle . <p> They could still send their children to school . They could still respect and help each other . They could still moderate their use of alcohol . They could still be decent , law-abiding citizens . <p> I had the benefit of people who knew they had to walk a straighter line , climb a taller mountain and carry a heavier load . They took all that segregation and prejudice would allow them and at the same time fought to remove these awful barriers . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only do you have to contend with the ever-present bigotry , you must do so with a recent tradition that almost requires you to wallow in excuses . You now have a popular national rhetoric which says that you ca n't learn because of racism , you ca n't raise the babies you make because of racism , you ca n't get up in the mornings because of racism . You commit crimes because of racism . Unlike me , you must not only overcome the repressiveness of racism , you must also overcome the lure of excuses . You have twice the job I had . <p> Do not be lured by sirens and purveyors of misery who profit from constantly regurgitating all that is wrong with black Americans and blaming these problems on others . Do not succumb to this temptation of always blaming others . <p> Do not become obsessed with all that is wrong with our race . Rather , become obsessed with looking for solutions to our problems . Be tolerant of all positive ideas ; their number is much smaller than the countless number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get . <p> Most importantly , draw on that great lesson and those positive role models who have gone down this road before us . We are badgered and pushed by our friends and peers to do unlike our parents and grandparents  --  we are told not to be old-fashioned . But they have weathered the storm . It is up to us now to learn how . Countless hours of research are spent to determine why blacks fail or why we commit crimes . Why ca n't we spend a few hours learning how those closest to us have survived and helped us get this far ? <p> As your front-runner , I have gone ahead and taken a long , hard look . I have seen two roads from my perch a few humble feet above the madding crowd . On the first , a race of people is rushing mindlessly down a highway of sweet , intoxicating destruction , with all its bright lights and grand promises constructed by social scientists and politicians . To the side , there is a seldom used , overgrown road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obstacles . It is the road  --  the old-fashioned road  --  traveled by those who endured slavery , who endured Jim Crowism , who endured hatred . It is the road that might reward hard work and discipline , that might reward intelligence , that might be fair and provide equal opportunity . But there are no guarantees . <p> You must choose . The lure of the highway is seductive and enticing . But the destruction is certain . To travel the road of hope and opportunity is hard and difficult , but there is a chance that you might somehow , some way , with the help of God , make it . @@649970 New York City Present day <p> " Oh , now I do like this ! " Eliza Knight exclaimed , though there was no one within earshot . <p> She brushed a thick layer of dust from the mirror of the scarred little vanity table and peered into the silvery glass . The sudden appearance of her own reflection startled her and she paused for a moment to regard the hazy image . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not exactly beautiful , then slightly exotic , with its high cheekbones , straight if somewhat narrow nose and full lips . Her dark eyes were , she confirmed , still her best feature , though she also liked her glossy black hair , despite the longish , flyaway cut she 'd let her hairdresser talk her into a couple of weeks before . <p> Grimacing at the hair , Eliza stepped back to take a better look at the old-fashioned rosewood dressing table . In the hour or so that she had been poking through the clutter of the shabby West Side antiques warehouse that was allegedly open only to the " Trade , " the vanity was the only thing that had caught her eye . She had spied it just moments earlier , crammed between an art deco floor lamp and a Jetsons pink 1950s Formica coffee table , and had immediately felt herself drawn to it . <p> Taking her eyes from the dulled mirror , Eliza scanned the rows of dusty merchandise stretching in every direction like a bad Cubist painting . She finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taking stock of an ancient gasoline pump with a cracked glass top . <p> " Jerry , " she called excitedly , " I want your opinion . Come over here and take a look at this ! " <p> Jerry had gotten them admitted to the wholesaler 's warehouse through one of his clients , who ran a small freight-forwarding business . Now he smiled good-naturedly and waved back . He carefully replaced the brass nozzle on the gas pump before starting toward her , the round lenses of his wire-framed glasses glittering like little moons beneath the cold fluorescents of the overhead fixtures . <p> Eliza sighed inwardly as she watched him picking his way through the maze of old furniture , noting the extraordinary care he took not to soil his Old Navy khakis and spotless cotton pullover . They had met two years earlier , through an artist friend of hers , when Eliza had been looking for someone to manage the small investment portfolio her father had left her . Jerry had turned out to be an excellent manager , increasing the value of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shrewdly using the capital to secure the down payment on the condo that also served as her studio , thus eliminating more than half the taxes she 'd been paying as a renter . <p> Somehow while all of that was going on they had started dating and then , occasionally , sleeping together . It was marginally comfortable and definitely low maintenance on both sides . There had been a few times in recent months when she had felt as though the relationship was either going to progress into something more serious or end altogether , and had to admit that it would n't really bother her that much if it did end . Feeling slightly mercenary , she consoled herself with the thought that at least her net worth had never been higher . <p> Turning her attention back to the vanity table , Eliza dragged it out into the aisle and slowly ran her strong artist 's hands over the marred top . Despite its numerous scratches , the old wood felt comfortably warm to her touch . The slightly formal , squared-off design vaguely reminded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her antique guidebooks , and she wondered how old it really was . <p> " So , what rare treasure have you uncovered ? " <p> Eliza raised her eyes to the mirror and saw Jerry adjusting his glasses to peer over her shoulder . <p> " Look , " she said , stepping away to afford him a clear view of the vanity , " is n't it adorable ? " <p> " I thought you were looking for a floor lamp , " he said , barely glancing at the table . <p> " I was , " Eliza replied peevishly , " but I really like this . It 's kind of charming , do n't you think ? " <p> " Hmmm ... " Frowning as if he 'd just been served a piece of tainted fish , Jerry leaned over and examined a tiny pink sticker that Eliza had n't noticed adhering to the side of the vanity . " At six hundred dollars it 's not that charming , " he sniffed . " Besides , the mirror 's a mess . " Jerry straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment counselor , I heartily recommend going with a lamp . " <p> Chapter Two Fresh from a scalding shower , swaddled in her threadbare , old terry robe with her hair wrapped in a towel , Eliza stepped barefoot into her bedroom and regarded the prized vanity , which looked right at home among the mismatched collection of antique furniture filling the room . <p> " I really want your honest opinion now , " she said , turning to look at the figure sprawled carelessly across the colorful patchwork quilt covering her Victorian-era four-poster bed . " Do you think I made an awful mistake ? " <p> Wickham , an overweight gray tabby with a severe personality disorder , spread his considerable jaws wide and yawned to demonstrate his complete indifference to her question . <p> Not to be so easily deterred , Eliza scooped up the cat in her arms and crossed to the corner by the window , where Jerry had somewhat sullenly deposited the antique dressing table two hours earlier . The hazed rectangular mirror stood on the floor beside the table , leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment Eliza sank cross-legged onto the carpet before them , cradling the squirming cat in her lap . <p> " I think the whole problem with Jerry and our relationship , " she explained to Wickham , " can be summed up in this table . Because when I look at it I see something warm and beautiful . But all Jerry sees is a piece of used furniture . You 're a creature of discerning taste . What do you see , Wickham ? " <p> Eliza smiled and scratched the special spot between Wickham 's ears . The cat 's yellow eyes rolled back in his head and he stiffened and moaned in ecstasy . <p> " My point exactly ! " Eliza gloated . " Because , unlike you and me , Jerry has no soul , just a bottom line . " She released her grip on Wickham , who leaped out of her lap and settled himself comfortably on the carpet . <p> " It really is a lovely piece , " she said , gently reaching to stroke the satiny finish of an unscarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil but she was pretty sure that it was very old . <p> As Eliza carefully removed the single drawer from the table , setting it on the floor before her , she noticed that it was lined with now-faded pink wallpaper that still retained a floral pattern . Ignoring the liner , she turned the drawer around and examined the outside corners , which had been fitted together without nails . <p> The slightly irregular dovetails holding the sides of the drawer together meant they were obviously cut by hand , reinforcing her belief that the table was old , crafted before the age of machine-made , mass-produced furniture . <p> Eliza smiled ruefully , for though she was entirely correct about the dovetails , she had also exhausted virtually the entire store of knowledge she remembered from the NYU evening extension class she 'd taken two years earlier on appraising antique furniture . <p> Nevertheless , she turned the drawer over to inspect the bottom , vaguely recalling something about being sure the wood colors matched or did n't match or something . The pink liner fluttered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Interested at last , Wickham swatted at the crumbling paper . Eliza shooed him away and then stared in surprise at the liner . For adhering to its underside was another strip of yellowing paper densely covered in cramped black type . <p> " Look , Wickham , it 's a piece of ... old newspaper ! " she exclaimed , squinting to read the oddly shaped and embellished letters . " Listen to this , " she breathed , tracing with her index finger a heavier line of print bannered across the top of the sheet : " THE HAMPSHIRE CHRONICLE , 7 APRIL , 1810 ... My God , that was almost two hundred years ago ! " <p> Her attention now riveted by the partial sheet of ancient newsprint , Eliza carefully lifted it onto the top of the vanity and spent the next few minutes curiously poring over several tightly packed columns of ads for " Gentlemen 's best quality silk cravats , " " beneficial beef extracts , " " drayage and forwarding " ( whatever they might be ) , and a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potion , calibrated boiling thermometers and India rubber goods . <p> When finally her eyes tired of squinting at the strange , old-fashioned print she gave the sturdy little table another cursory inspection . Then she knelt beside the mirror and stood it upright , noticing again with some dismay that the silvered surface was , as Jerry had pointed out in the warehouse , badly worn . <p> Cheerfully dismissing the hazing as enhancing the overall charm of the piece , she experimentally tilted the mirror toward her and was distressed to see that the wood backing on one side was pulling away from the frame . " Oh , great ! The backing seems to be warped , " she murmured to the cat . " Now give me some support here , Wickham . I 'd hate to have to admit that Jerry might have been right after all . " <p> Wickham stretched and meowed . <p> " Thanks , " Eliza grinned . " I needed that . " <p> She pulled the mirror to her and turned it around to get a better look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visible gap appeared to be no more than six inches long . " Well , it 's not as bad as I thought , " she said . " I think it only needs to be reglued . " With her fingernail she experimentally lifted the edge of the backing from the mirror frame in an attempt to determine how far the separation extended . As she did so , something fell out of the mirror and landed on the carpet with a soft plop . <p> Attracted by the sudden motion , Wickham leaped onto the fallen object and hissed menacingly . Eliza pushed him away and stared at the thing in surprise . She slowly leaned the mirror back against the wall , then reached down and lifted the fallen object into the light . <p> She remained frozen on her knees for several seconds , gazing at her hand while she tried to reconstruct what had just happened . For she was holding a slim packet of thick , sepia-toned paper tied together like a Christmas package with a crisscross of bright green ribbon . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart back to the mirror and glimpsing her own puzzled expression . <p> Something swatted against her hand and she looked down to see Wickham resolutely batting at the end of the bright ribbon . Snatching her hand away from him , she got to her feet and examined the packet more closely . Held together by the broad ribbon , she saw , were two rectangles of folded paper . The one on top was smaller than the other and had been written across in reddish brown ink , the words obscured by the ribbon covering them . <p> " Letters ! " she exclaimed . <p> Eliza turned the packet over and saw that the larger of the two letters had been sealed with a blob of shiny red material that she guessed must be sealing wax , though it looked like no other wax she had ever seen , having more the consistency of brittle plastic . Intrigued , she carefully untied the ribbon securing the packet , so that she could read the address on the top envelope . <p> " Miss Jane Austen , Chawton Cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the famous nineteenth-century author , Eliza paused and took a deep breath before she could read the remainder of the address on the letter . Jane Austen ! Again she had to pause as her eyes raced ahead of her trembling lips . " Jane Austen Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy , Chawton Great House , ' " she squeaked . <p> Eliza stood there on her bedroom carpet for several more seconds , silently reading and rereading the words inscribed neatly across the front of the smaller envelope . <p> The thoughts racing through Eliza 's head at that moment were somewhat difficult to define . For although she would not have classified herself as a voracious reader , she was well-enough read , her tastes running largely to popular fiction with a smattering of respectable old favorites , ranging from the works of Agatha Christie and Damon Runyon to a few major poets and several classical novelists . <p> And , like many women , one of Eliza 's very favorite novels , numbered among half a dozen well-worn books occupying the small shelf beneath her bedside table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's uncompromising quest for a perfect love . <p> Which is only to say that Eliza Knight knew precisely who Jane Austen was , and she certainly knew who Fitzwilliam Darcy , the purported recipient of the letter she now held in her hand , was , or at least who he was supposed to be . <p> With the letters in her hand she went to the bed and sat down . Gazing at the window , her reflection surrounded by a moonlit halo , Eliza 's imagination swirled with what ifs and could it bes . She smiled to herself . Jerry would be laughing and berating her for such romantic notions and , in truth , as wildly romantic as the idea was , it was ludicrous , patently absurd ; because the relationship suggested by the enigmatic address on the letter was flatly impossible . Darcy was , after all , a fictitious character , was n't he ? <p> Looking down at Wickham , who had followed her to the bed , she said , " Well , there 's only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In spite of her well-founded skepticism as to the authenticity of the letters , Eliza felt her heart trip-hammer in her chest and her hands tremble as she opened the larger of the two letters : the one that was addressed to Jane Austen from Fitzwilliam Darcy with the broad , scrawled pen strokes of a man 's hand . She read aloud : <p> 12 May , 1810 <p> Dearest Jane , <p> The Captain has found me out . I am being forced to go into hiding immediately . But if I am able , I shall still be waiting at the same spot tonight . Then you will know everything you wish to know . F. Darcy <p> Eliza paused to consider the meaning of those few sparse sentences . And when she began to read it over again there was a slight quaver in her voice . For this was not at all what she had expected . Though , on momentary reflection , she was not quite sure exactly what she had expected to find in Darcy 's letter-some flowery romantic tribute , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair . How odd ... being found out , going into hiding . What did that mean ? Maybe the other letter was Austen 's reply and so held the answers . <p> Slipping the first letter behind the other in her hand , she examined it with awe . The lovely feminine handwriting flowed across the page and , turning it over in her hands , she saw that the sealing wax was still intact , a fanciful letter A impressed into it . This one had never been read , maybe never sent . Why ? Tracing the curves of the seal with the tip of her finger , she curiously experienced a tingling sensation that shot like a jolt of electricity through her body . <p> " Wickham , can you imagine what it would mean if the letter really was written by Jane Austen ? " She looked at the cat , who was unconcernedly applying his long pink tongue to one of his wickedly clawed front paws . Eliza sighed , " No , of course you ca n't , you poor thing , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it over and over again in her hands . If it was genuine and she opened it , she would forever be known as the stupid artist who ruined a historic document . <p> Before she burned her bridges , Eliza decided she needed to try and find out something about the fictitious Mr. Darcy . Maybe the Internet would give her the answers she sought . <p> Chapter Three In sharp contrast to Eliza 's bedroom-which , with its eclectic collection of old wooden furniture , framed prints and warm fabric accents , could only be described as cozy-the living room of her small condo ( actually the workroom and studio where she created her art and operated her Internet gallery ) was all twenty-first-century business . <p> In front of the large window that allowed her to look directly into the wheelhouses of passing freighters on the East River were arrayed her white IKEA computer desk and drawing board , and beside them the wide steel filing cabinets , airbrush , paints and other equipment necessary to her work . <p> Hanging on the otherwise bare walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other natural and whimsical subjects in which she specialized . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
