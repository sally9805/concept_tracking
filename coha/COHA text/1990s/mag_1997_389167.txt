For Jerry Linenger , who survived a fire on Mir , last week 's space crash was no Mir coincidence Photograph " Everyone kept talking about the fire because it was dramatic , " says Linenger ( aboard Mir ) . " But other things were on my mind . " // On June 25 , during a practice docking maneuver , a resupply ship crashed into the space station Mir . As an outer wall of Mir ruptured , oxygen began pouring out into space . Quickly the crew of two Russians and one American closed a hatch to seal off the damaged area . But the incident was a reminder that " spaceflight , " in the words of American astronaut Jerry Linenger , 42 , " is a dangerous business . " And it seems especially dangerous aboard Mir-as Captain Linenger , a physician , knows firsthand . Linenger recently returned from a 133-day trip aboard the trouble-plagued Russian space station , which was designed to last five years but has now been orbiting the Earth for more than 11 . Although Linenger has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he had bargained for . Soon after his arrival , he had to contend with a potentially disastrous flash fire . ( Although NASA downplayed it , the blaze was the most serious known to have occurred in an orbiting spacecraft . ) That was followed by critical breakdowns in Mir 's cooling , steering and air-filtration systems . In the meantime , in Russia 's Star City , an hour outside Moscow , Kathryn , Linenger 's wife of eight years , waited . As project science coordinator for NASA , she was on hand to help train the next Mir crew . She was also pregnant with their second child and worried because she was able to have only fragmented exchanges with her husband . Much of the communications time was claimed by technicians trying to correct Mir 's problems . When the Linengers were reunited at Cape Canaveral on May 24 , " she was really bawling , " remembers Jerry . Back in Houston since May 25 , Linenger now spends his days in physical rehab to help readjust to gravity and reclaim muscle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an American astronaut . At the fourbedroom home he shares with Kathryn , 32 , and his son John , 1 , he spoke with Laurel Brubaker Calkins from PEOPLE about his troubles on Mir . THE REAL CHALLENGES BEGAN 41 days after I arrived aboard Mir At 10:35 p.m . Moscow time on Feb. 23 , we were in the midst of a crew change-two Russian cosmonauts had arrived on Feb. 12 , and two more plus a German researcher were to leave on March 2 via a Soyuz capsule . Since there were six people onboard , Aleksandr Lazutkin , the incoming flight engineer , was in the Kvant I module opening a portable oxygen canister . Apparently there was a crack in the canister , because as he activated it , flames shot out about two to three feet . There was nothing subtle ; this was a major fire , a white-hot blowtorch with sparks and bits of molten metal flying around . I was in another part of the station , which is composed of six interconnected modules , working on a computer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying out to get the fire extinguishers . Just as I yelled , " Is it serious ? " I saw smoke pouring into the module I was in . We held our breath and stumbled over to our emergency oxygen masks , which were about 20 feet away . Very quickly the smoke built up , so we could n't see . I grabbed a second extinguisher and followed Valerie Korzun back to the fire . To reach it we had to go through a tunnel the size of a porthole , with the flames shooting crosswise across the other end of it . So we could n't get more than one guy in there to fight it . I ended up feeding him extinguishers and grabbing him from time to time-if he could still kick , I knew he was okay . There are two words you do n't want to hear on a space station : " decompression " and " fire . " We had the fire , and the next thing that could have gone wrong was decompression . If the fire had spread , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the atmosphere would have been sucked out of the station , and we would have burned to a crisp . Everybody was immediately ready to get onto those Soyuz rescue vehicles and get out of there . The problem was that you could n't get through the fire to get to one of them , and each vehicle could hold just three guys . But I was actually very calm . I knew I had to keep a cool head if we were going to get this fire out . Fortunately the fire burned itself out after 14 minutes . Afterward everybody got real calm-it was " let 's sit down and breathe quietly to conserve the oxygen in our respirators . " The smoke did n't thin out for 45 minutes ; you want to open a window , but of course that 's not an option up there . After it was all done , I was busyexamining the other crew members , checking oxygen levels in their blood and lungs . One of my concerns was : What burned ? Did we have toxic fumes ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I got to bed , I was totally exhausted , so I never really had that oh , my God ! thing about what happened . We conducted some great experiments after the fire , but soon I had other things on my mind : On April 19 the station lost its gyrodynes-motion stabilizers-and began a slow tumble through space . If we had n't been able to correct it , it would have been very difficult to dock the shuttle and catch my ride home . You could feel the roll even in weightlessness . That lasted maybe four days until we got one of the gyrodynes going again . Then the cooling system began leaking seriously , a problem that began before I got there and still persists . We 'd have temperatures of 95 degrees . That went on for five weeks , with the humidity going up . Meanwhile the antifreeze from the leaking cooling system made Mir smell like an old gas station . And the carbon dioxide removal system malfunctioned at the same time ; the COZ level began to rise , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to exercise was when it was a problem . You 'd have labored breathing , and it would be hard to distinguish what was bothering you-is it the COz or the fumes or the heat ? It did clear with time , as we got the systems repaired . And after I got home , I did some tests and determined I 'm okay .

Photograph After returning from space to Cape Canaveral , Linenger brought a bear for John and tulips for Kathryn. // Actually , heat was n't much of a problem-except when I was sleeping . You 're sleeping strapped to the wall , head down . When the station was on the sunny side of Earth , you 'd get hot and open up your sleeping bag . But 45 minutes later when you 're on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One interesting thing about being up in space unshielded by the atmosphere : When you close your eyes , you can see the cosmic radiation hitting your retina . It 's like little camera flashes . My spacewalk on April 29 was fantastic , glorious . But it was a bit of mind over matter , like the fire . Because of the speed of our orbit and the rounded surface of Mir , I felt as if I were falling off the edge of a cliff the whole time . In reality I was flying at 18,000 mph ; you just do n't feel it while you 're inside the station . So my initial impulse was to scream . I did n't want to let go of the handrail . To add to the excitement , I was walking in space attached to the end of a very long , thin pole . I felt like a fish on the end of a long fly-fishing rod , getting whipped back and forth . It was a telescoping pole , and Comdr . Vasily Tsibliev would move me where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " Whoa ! " He 'd move me a little bit and then he 'd stop , but I 'd continue to go , snapping back and forth . One of the things I missed most was communications with Kathryn . The phone connections were so bad , a lot of the time all I knew was that she was alive . Kathryn sent videos on the Progress resupply capsule showing John doing his latest things . I 'd watch them with a mixture of feelings . After I 'd turn them off , I 'd have this yearning and really miss them . You would compartmentalize those feelings and do your job , but then a video or a chance to talk to them would bring it all back . I tried writing John e-mails , just to let him know I was thinking about him . I gave him advice : " Do n't go five months without a bath , do n't eat your food upside down above the table , do n't sleep on the wall . " Of course it was all worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the edge . But to get back to Earth alive-I can now say it was the adventure of a lifetime . I 'd do it all again-just not today .
