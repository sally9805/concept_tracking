In the late winter of 1985 , John Rogan had been a surgeon for most thirty-five years , and though still active and vital , a tall , erect , white-haired man , with a reputation for audacity matched by success , he was thinking of retiring . His older brother , also a surgeon , had apparently committed suicide the year before . He had fallen or jumped from the turret of a castle he was visiting in Ireland , and Rogan , who had always pursued life as though sighting a rifle , suddenly found he was losing his aim . <p> It seemed possible that if his brother could destroy himself , then suicide might overtake Rogan as well . He struggled with this thought and concealed it . Now he was on his morning rounds , and Nina Hendersen passing in the hall caught sight of him and on an impulse stopped him , placing herself in front of him , blocking his way . She had heard other women talk about him and liked his looks but did n't know what she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago Rogan would n't have given her a second glance , but now he did . She was young-looking to be near forty . The tag on her smock said she was a physical therapist . She gazed up with an odd look of determination and then , remembering herself , smiled . Excuse me . I need some advice , she began in a small voice and then gathered strength and went on in an exacting way as though making a diagnosis . I have a patient with an injury to the adductor longus . It separated from the pubis in a skiing accident . She wants to know when she can have sex again . The words spilled almost without Nina 's awareness . She scanned Rogan 's face , thinking he looked like Paul Newman . He had the same blue eyes . <p> Rogan understood she was trying to flirt . Well , how long has it been ? <p> Nina pulled an answer from the air . Weeks . <p> Anytime , then , Rogan said with a trace of humor , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then it seemed Nina 's nerve failed . She blushed deeply , saying she would give the patient his advice , and then hurried off , her thick braid flicking at her waist , putting Rogan in mind of <p> girl he had once known who spent all her time riding horses , a small , angular , and oddly attractive girl who had little to say , at least to him . He watched her to the end of the hall . At the last instant , she looked back in panic  --  she did n't believe what she 'd said  --  and turned the corner and was gone . He smiled wryly and dismissed the event , yet at odd moments found himself thinking about her . The braid looked as thick as a man 's wrist . <p> Late that same day , Nina 's husband , Johnny Hendersen , arrived home from Cleveland , where he 'd been on business for Pharmikon , one of the drug companies that employed him as a PR consultant . She had not expected him that afternoon or any particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips had become more frequent , his delays unconvincingly explained in long distance calls from hotel rooms . <p> She had been vaguely waiting for him to call again from wherever he was , and now when she was startled by the familiar sounds of his movements  --  the cautious turning of the key in the lock and the surreptitious whisk of his door across the carpeting  --  as he came in through his office instead of the family entrance , she knew he had been with another woman this trip and could already see the dishonest grin that would greet her . She felt exhausted , her anger banked down to hatred . If she did n't act glad to see him , he would frown and go back in his office until Eric and Ian came home from school and he could avoid her by paying attention to them . If she confronted him , they would argue . But she knew what was true without asking . It was a year since they last made love . She would n't lower herself to accuse him . Yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faithful . <p> That night , after the children were in bed , Nina sat at the vanity and carefully unbraided and brushed her hair . It made static and sparks . When she was a girl , adults at parties often gathered around her and took turns touching her hair , holding her braid and exclaiming over its softness and weight . Hendersen , lying in bed , watched her over the top of his book . He loved her hair , and the sight of her brushing it , her arms raised so that her nightgown pulled against her chest and ribs , aroused him . Her eyes caught his in the mirror , and he glanced away . Soon , she came to bed , and they lay side by side , he with his book and she with hers . He was a former football player and lay under the blanket like an escarpment under snow . After a time , he closed his book and turned toward her . It 's not what you think . <p> How do you know what I think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She turned a look on him . What else can I think ? The way you act , the way you treat me . <p> I 've have n't been cheating on you , he said firmly . I 've just been going to see Polly for the past few months  --  whenever I travel , that 's all . I stop off and spend an afternoon or two with her . <p> did n't mention it because I knew it would upset you . <p> Polly was their teenage daughter institutionalized with severe cerebral palsy . They seldom talked about her , and it seemed to Nina that he was using Polly as an excuse . Why would you start going to see her again all of a sudden ? <p> I had a feeling . <p> A feeling , Nina said flatly . <p> That I should go , he said . <p> Her frustration with him was becoming unbearable to her . She marked her place in her book and put it on her chest , folding her hands on it . What do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days at a time ? <p> I just visit . Hendersen lifted a hand , and his fingers made a small gesture caressing the air . I hold her . I talk to her . Sometimes I take her outside in a wheelchair and put her on a blanket in the leaves . She 's getting better . <p> Nina 's voice rose with fear . Better ? How is she getting better ? <p> It 's just small things . She 's stronger , more alert . Sometimes she squeezes my fingers . I think she recognizes me . <p> You always think that , Nina said . <p> Hendersen was offended . No I do n't . <p> Yes you do . You just do n't remember . Anyway , the doctors have told us over and over : there 's no way to reach her . <p> How do we know that ? Hendersen sat up , dragging all the covers with him . If she 's aware , then everything we do reaches her , and if she 's only a little aware , then something reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what difference does that make ? It 's not about her recognizing us , it 's about us recognizing her . <p> I do n't believe this , Nina said tensely . Give me back the covers . I thought we 'd been over this all a long time ago . I thought we agreed . You have no idea how cruel it is to bring it all up again . Nina was seething . You have no idea  --  none !  --  what it 's like to be the mother . <p> A minute passed and then another . <p> His weight shifted toward her . Listen to me . Will you just listen to me . You do n't have to do anything , just listen . He reached for the book on her chest . May I put this away ? <p> She shook her head . I 'm going to read some more . <p> He lay down and closed his eyes , but it was hard to keep silent . He needed to talk it out . He wanted to know what Nina really thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Polly 's life ? If she was given life , was n't she also given love ? But if she could n't express love , what happened to it ? What was love ? What was their love ? His thoughts circulated until at last he said , You know , I get lonely . <p> Nina eyed him bitterly . Maybe you should stay home more . <p> Maybe I should , he said . <p> Later , she lay awake , and a troubling memory came to her . She saw the unborn child , like a small , beautiful darkling god , folded upside down waiting to be delivered . But afterward , the infant , whose injury showed in small indentations of forceps on the sides of her skull , seemed like a punishment for the unwed pregnancy , an atonement she was meant to embrace but could not . It was too ugly , and now it seemed to her she never would have married Johnny Hendersen if she had n't been pregnant . People said he was nice , but if you listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cold and confusing , coiling around your heart to trick you into admitting something when there was nothing to admit . There was a name for his trick , but what was it ? She tried to think until her mind grew weary and blank , and then as she was falling asleep , it came to her that the word she wanted was deceit , and she drifted off with the satisfaction of at least having named the thing . <p> The next morning , he was up early and out of the house , and Nina , feeling alone and defiant , picked up the phone and called John Rogan 's office . She invented an ailment and dropped the name of a well-known internist that would get her in sooner . An appointment was made for the next day . Nina felt herself expanding , pressing outward , filling space so there was no separation between herself and the things around her . She had a mad desire to tell someone , to shout , to break things . The inside of her face felt tight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror in her closet , she looked the same . It was like being two people at once . She parted her robe and drew a line down along her breastbone , over her abdomen , and smoothed her hand onto her pubis . She struck a pose , raising one foot on its toes . Her stomach was flat . She did n't look like she 'd had children . There were no stretch marks . She slid the robe off and leaned her forehead against the glass , imagining the other person was him . <p> When she arrived , a small woman , looking hurried and flushed , and dressed in an odd , plain brown dress as clumsy as <p> monk 's robe , Rogan greeted her with a slight smile . His memory of her did n't quite coincide with the reality . When she was seated , they grew silent until at last he said , What brings you ? <p> The color rose vividly in Nina 's face . She had imagined he would make everything easy . I 'm worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her chin strained upward in defended pride , revealing strong chords and vessels in her neck . She looked quite healthy . My heart makes a noise in my ears , sometimes fast , sometimes slow , like the wings of a bug trapped inside my ear . <p> have pains in my chest . She made a face as if none of it mattered . <p> The surgeon nodded . I see . And what did your doctor say ? <p> Nina made a small , indifferent noise . He did n't say much of anything . <p> Rogan thumbed up the corner of Nina 's folder and let it drop . It was empty except for the pink sheet she had filled out in the waiting room . I suppose , he said , we could order some tests . That has n't been done yet . He made an upward turning motion of his hand . <p> Are n't you going to examine me ? She was afraid she was about to be dismissed . <p> Rogan leaned back , pressing his fingertips together , and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cardiologist , assuming that 's what you need ? His eyebrow twitched up in query . <p> She seemed to draw back a little into herself . You have a good reputation , and I did n't know where else to go . <p> Rogan was n't sure why he was reluctant . The situation seemed clear , and in the past he would n't have hesitated . He swiveled his chair and stood up . Her eyes followed him , and she moved to rise , her hands closing like bird beaks on the flat gray purse sliding from her lap . <p> Rogan cleared his throat . I 'll go out while you undress . When you 're ready , have a seat on the table . He gestured toward it and smiled musingly . But I guess you know the drill since you have patients of your own . <p> Nina had been holding her breath and now exhaled . She wondered how much to take off . Her dress was two pieces , a skirt and top . <p> Rogan went out , pulling the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might as well take lunch early . <p> You look serious as a stone , she teased . I guess I know what that means . <p> She enjoyed his embarrassment . What 's the complaint ? <p> Heart , Rogan said . <p> Infectious ? <p> Hardly . <p> Then you 'll be safe enough . She fished her wallet out of her purse and touched his arm as she went out . <p> He was surprised to find himself alone . He went out into the hall , toward the men 's room , his heart quickening , which amused him because it would seem that at sixty-one  --  But I 'm young enough , he thought  --  and as many times as he had done what he was about to do  --  I 'm going to , are n't I ... yes , I think I am  --  he should not be particularly nervous , yet there it was , a quickening that would scare the wits out of a heart patient . He paused to take a drink from the water fountain . The arc of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could he trust her ? <p> He walled with his hands clasped behind his back , the posture he assumed when talking with the next of kin . By long practice , he approached questions in terms of their underlying statements : Ultimately , the woman in his office was not interested in him personally but in him as a means to an end . <p> Another doctor rushing by spoke out in passing , Hey , that was a nice piece of work in the ER . Looks like you 're back in the game . <p> Rogan nodded . So everyone thought he was flagging . His brother had once told him that being a surgeon was simply an extreme form of life . You oppose death , and you have to be strong . It was a question of will , and ego . <p> As he stepped into the men 's room , he glanced at his watch . He had an hour and a half free . Perhaps she had figured out his routine and planned her visit to fall before the lunch hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood everything . Or , perhaps she was acting impulsively . In any case , she was bold . But later , if she went home and realized she was more than ever alone , she would be inclined to come back . He would have to be dear with her , so they 'd make no mistake . <p> Glancing in the mirror , straightening a strand of his hair , he thought of his nurse . She had been with him twenty years . Longer than most marriages , and like a married couple , they had grown alike . Their separate lovers came and went , and they remained each other 's longest companion . She had an aunt in Iowa and went once a year to visit . When the aunt died , she would have an inheritance . If anything happened to him , she could retire if she wanted or go to work for someone else . But what could happen ? <p> He washed and then dried his hands , holding them up in the mirror . They were smooth from many washings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nina was seated on the end of the examining table in the bay window . The furniture in the room was heavy wood , which recalled childhood visits to the doctor . She liked going because there was comfort in being told you were well , or in having an illness named and being told what to do . She recalled how good it was to be young and strong and growing , and suddenly that sensation went cold . She put her hand on her chest and rubbed the cloth of the dressing gown . <p> The door opened , and the surgeon came in , drawing his stethoscope from his pocket and placing the earpieces around his neck . He closed the door , and Nina heard the click of the bolt . <p> He stepped forward , a single , narrow line pinching his brow . Are you all right ? <p> Her hand fell to her lap , and she gazed down . The top of her head seemed round and small . He worried he had misjudged her . Is it your heart ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to her he should already know what was going on . Her body ached . She wanted to stretch . <p> He saw it was up to him and cleared his throat . Usually I 'd have my nurse in , but it 's her lunch hour , and since you 're in the profession , too  --  he made a dismissive gesture with his hand  --  I thought we could get along without her . It 's a risk we can take , do n't you think ? <p> Nina spoke as if amused . I 'm not going to sue you . <p> So you say , Rogan said lightly , but patients are notoriously ungrateful , you know that ? <p> She smiled . I wo n't be ungrateful . <p> Good . He warmed the head of his stethoscope in his palm . Let 's listen to your heart . <p> He put the earpieces into his ears , and for a moment he and Nina watched each other . He saw the hooded anger in her eyes and knew she was scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He opened the vent in the back of her gown and auscultated her . His left hand rested on her shoulder , his thumb at the nape of her neck . Her braid was in the way , and she reached over her shoulder to free it , and their hands touched , sending a hollow sensation into her knees . <p> Cough , he said . And again . <p> You 're listening to my lungs , not my heart , she said . <p> That 's true , he said , but all we know is that you have a pain in the chest . Does it hurt when you breathe ? <p> Sometimes . <p> His hand tightened on her shoulder and then released . All right , he said , the other side now . <p> She slipped her arms from the sleeves of the gown and let it fall to her waist . She was muscular , the collarbones curving cleanly into angular shoulders , the sternum like a deep thumbprint between shallow breasts , the ribs and abdomen well-defined . She turned her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He placed a hand on her shoulder and brought the stethoscope to her heart and looked down as he listened . <p> She saw white hair sprouting in his ear and the shaven slickness of his cheek and the starched texture of his white smock , the weave of the cotton minutely dear . She felt dizzy . She wished he would say something . <p> He listened to the few small ounces of blood moving from auricle to ventricle . Your heart is normal , he said , though I think you 're nervous about being here . His hand tightened on her shoulder . Would you like to listen to your heart ? <p> She made a reflexive noise in the back of her throat , half yes and half no , raising an arm to cover herself . He placed the head of the stethoscope in her hand and moved it to her heart . Her eyes trembled with a sudden tenderness . He put the earpieces in her ears and turned and walked a little away to give her a moment 's privacy . Perhaps she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked , would n't the heart rebel ? Would n't it ache ? <p> Nina tried to catch the sound . It came pulsing through the stethoscope , and faintly from inside her . <p> What she wanted  --  his back was turned ; he would face her in a moment , and she knew she would have to be ready ... to lie down with him ?  --  was something she had always believed was wrong . But there was already so much wrong that the old rules no longer held , and something new had to be found . The colliding beats of her heart grew sharp . She pulled the earpieces from her ears . <p> The surgeon came to her and took hold of the stethoscope , which Nina started to let go of and then held on to , her hands folding in , his hand on the earpiece moving toward her so that neither of them knew how it happened  --  did she mean to ? did he ? The back of his hand rested against her breast . His thumb moved across it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a husband , he said . <p> Her hand closed tightly on the earpiece . It wo n't matter . <p> Everything matters , he said . <p> She pushed herself against him , putting an arm over his shoulder . The paper on the examining table crinkled . Her mouth bumped his , and her tongue darted against his teeth . His hands were on her hips . You 're determined , he said . But you ought- <p> Stop it , she said . She pulled the gown from around her waist . Take off your clothes . I want to see you . She tugged the ends of his bow tie loose . <p> Wait , he said . I 'll do it . <p> He folded his clothes over the back of his chair . She waited , crossing her arms , watching his freckled backside . And then he turned , and she saw he was attractive after all , lean and white-haired . He took her hand , and they lay on the carpet . <p> As he kissed her , he toyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek . His fingers tugged the red elastic band . Let me undo it , he said . <p> No , she said . <p> Why ? I 'd love to see it down . It 's so thick . He brushed the end against his lips . <p> It 's too much trouble , she said . I 'd have to braid it back . <p> I 'll do it , he said . <p> No , she said and drew it out of his hand , leaning forward to kiss him . <p> After a while , their breathing grew fast . Rogan got up and went to the desk . <p> Nina watched , propped on an elbow . You do n't need that . <p> Nevertheless , he said . <p> He looked ridiculous , the penis arching upward , armored for love , the nipple tip drooping , his testicles hanging like an old valise . <p> Her expression went unconsciously wry with the comedy of sex , and lying there propped on her side , one leg drawn up , she seemed at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know any better thought seduction was romantic , but it was usually complex , involving endless strategies . You 're beautiful , he said , like a girl standing up on horseback in a circus . Nina saw herself and was amazed . <p> He knelt , and she gravely drew him down . <p> For a time , it seemed the pair might exhaust themselves before they reached the end . She watched sidelong , with slit eyes , her head turning in small , rhythmic circles , Rogan raised on his fists , as if pushing up . He varied his tactic and began touching her , and his touches reached her like urgings in a dream . He was a stranger . What they were doing could not be undone . They would do it again and again . Nina came suddenly , dully ; and Rogan , a while after . As it rippled away , she saw her apartment , the rooms sunlit and still , the floors tilted yet everything in place . She thought of going there , and the distance seemed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fingers brushed her lips . He was watching . What are you thinking ? he said . <p> Nothing . My mind was wandering . She gave him a little push to get off her , and he rose and went to the sink and brought a small white towel . <p> Nina laughed abruptly . <p> What ? he said . <p> You 're a doctor  --  Her voice wavered and broke off . <p> It occurred to him that she was unstable and might make a scene . He wanted to end things gracefully but would end them abruptly if he had to . He offered a hand to help her up . <p> She made show of ignoring him , stretching her arms over her head , and then got up on her own . She did a little dance step . She was amused because she was supposed to be uncertain of what was next , yet she knew . AU she had to do was whatever she wanted . She went to the window and lifted an edge of the shade and peered out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a child , she said . <p> Rogan was buttoning his shirt . You have two , I think . <p> She spoke as though repeating something everyone knew . No , another one ... in a hospital ... she 's dying . <p> I 'm sorry , Rogan said automatically . Maybe that 's what 's been causing you pain . <p> Nina laughed . Did n't you know ? I made that up . <p> She turned from the window and walked toward him , raising her head . Let him look , she thought . <p> He saw that he had trapped himself . If he refused her , she would hate him . For both of them , it was a question of getting from one moment to the next . <p> She came to him with the soft impact of a small , dense body jostling a large , light one . He steadied himself against her . She took him into her hand and circled his waist caressingly . They lowered themselves to the floor , Rogan wondering if he could manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and went back to his desk . Nina studied him . Take off your shirt . <p> Of course , he said . <p> He moved to her , and at the last instant , she held him off , a hand on his pelvis , and stared into his eyes . They were deep blue , the pupils narrowed to points of lust in which she felt her power . His hips trembled , her hand sliding off . They joined , and some of her heaviness of soul went over into the emptiness of his . Then , they were nothing more than the act itself . <p> They scooted , inching across the carpet , and knocked into a sofa . Nina broke out laughing while Rogan plunged on . <p> She saw the blank ceiling and thought of Johnny who would n't love her , Johnny who did this with others . She held on to the surgeon and lifted her hips , and when they came  --  Rogan , in big , round pulses , and Nina , in sharp , high beats that opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you . She felt her heart going out to him and held it back . <p> Rogan touched her ear , traced the line of her jaw , and kissed her , covering the moment with decorum . <p> When she was gone , Rogan tidied up and glanced at his date book . He had one more patient to see , a call to make to his broker , and then a tennis match at his club . Afterward , he would go home to dinner . He would turn in early and read from a journal . His habits defined him . He leaned back in his chair and thought about the past , about other women , what they 'd said and done , but it was an odd thing about sex that before long it left no memory of the feeling itself . Each new episode replaced the last , or , no , Rogan thought , it 's something else . Each episode was replaced by desire , so that what he remembered was desire rather than love itself . And it came to Rogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left to desire was death . He turned back a page of his date book and then another , as if looking for something . <p> In the hall outside her apartment , Nina heard laughter . She pushed open the door and saw Johnny and the children and the new au pair lying in a circle on the floor with their heads in each other 's laps . When they saw Nina , they stopped laughing , and the room seemed sharply divided . Each of them saw it . Her eyes met Hendersen 's with a look of triumph . His face was red from laughing . It 's a game , he said and began struggling to his feet . <p> Nina motioned to the boys . Go get cleaned up , and I 'll be there in a minute . <p> The au pair hesitated and then followed the little boys . <p> Why do you keep trying to hurt me ? Nina said . <p> That 's unfair , Hendersen said . We were only playing . <p> It 's inappropriate , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I know what I see , Nina said . <p> That night , Hendersen read a good-night story to Eric and Ian . Tucking them in , he kissed each boy 's forehead just below the hairline and inhaled their simple smell , which was dizzying in its reminder of how easily happiness was lost , and as if sensing his father 's worry , Ian , the younger child , put his arms around his father 's neck and would n't let go . Hendersen took the boy into his arms and silently hugged him , their two hearts  --  Hendersen 's big , middle-aged heart bumping with cares and the boy 's small , light one  --  beating together until father and son were contained in each other , and Ian let go of his father 's neck and , placing his small hands on Hendersen 's cheeks , said , I see where it hurts . <p> A rush of shame filled Hendersen . I know you do , he said . <p> It was something of a miracle , Hendersen reflected , that no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The older boy , Eric , lay watching them from his bed . I 'm trying to sleep , he complained . Above the lip of the blanket , his eyes were full of suspicion and seemed to take in everything for an accounting to be made in the future . <p> As Hendersen went out , he glanced in perplexity from one child to the other . That his children looked on him with sorrow and reproach touched his conscience , and passing through the hallway toward the living room , he summoned his resolve to humble himself and try again to put things right . <p> Nina was in her chair reading , her feet under her , the lamp sending a pool of warm light onto the crown of her head and over her , as though she were in a world of her own . It was a sight that made Hendersen veer . He scarcely knew he was afraid of her , but paced quietly around the room , trying to compose his mind , hesitating to speak . He stopped at the stereo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , I 'm trying to read . <p> Hendersen lowered the volume and went partway to her . I 've been thinking , he said , and maybe it 's true : I 've been trying to hurt you . He gave a small , sad laugh , and Nina looked up alertly . <p> I think I 'm angry , he said , that I have to go see Polly alone and that you ca n't really talk to me about her . He knew he was on thin ice and hurried on . But that 's no excuse . I owe you an apology . <p> should have let you know where I was and what I was doing instead of leaving you to wonder . Or , I should have kept it to myself and handled it in a way that would n't have mistreated you . I do n't know , maybe I wanted you to think I was staying away to see someone else , but I did n't think that . I just thought I was saving you from worry . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act with resentment . <p> He stood there looking uncertain , and her heart wavered . She thought he would say something more to make up for her misery , but nothing came . Instead , he held his arms open and made a little motion of his hands for her to come to him . It was too clever . She could n't trust him . You only want to feel better about yourself , she said . <p> But Nina , Hendersen implored , if we do n't make up , what else can we do ? <p> I do n't know . All I know is you 're going away again ... are n't you ? <p> It 's for work , he said . <p> It 's always for work , she said . <p> The conversation continued , and they were like two sides of a sharply pitched roof , though neither of them quite saw it . Each counted on the tension provided by the other . Between them were twenty years of marriage , the bonds of familiarity , the hopes and promises begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they separated , their life so far would be wasted .

Ca n't you just let me read ? <p> Hendersen turned and left the room . <p> The piece playing on the radio was ending . Nina listened . A trumpet cried and faded , the string bass flurried and descended , disappearing , while the piano sent footsteps strolling , someone not ready to go home , rain beginning lightly to fall , and a car passing on the wet street , the last bright notes sounding like dawn and the promise of sleep while others wake . Nina wished for a different life than her own , a life of freedom and choices and exciting people and love . <p> She did n't owe Johnny anything . She was sick of feeling an obligation . She thought of Rogan and then of Ian 's swimming ' teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank suit when he got out of the pool . <p> Hendersen sat in his office and stared at mail and papers stacked on his desk . He thought miserably of forgiveness and how it was <p> simple matter of yielding to one 's better nature , but it was impossible to forgive someone who would n't forgive herself , and equally impossible to live with her if she would n't forgive him . He thought of how he had taken care of Nina after Polly 's birth , how he had made it all right for Nina to stop seeing the child , but now it seemed that all he 'd done was help her hide a pain that was worse for being hidden . There was no relief , and the interior of life was closed to them . He reflected that this misfortune was what their sons would learn from them , and he thought of taking Eric and Ian and raising them on his own . It seemed to him that he could manage it , but as soon as he thought it , the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would never let go . They were what protected her from the fear of being a bad mother , having rejected one child . It occurred to him then that he had everything backwards : She was punishing herself but somehow she had tricked him , or he had tricked himself , into acting like the one who was punishing her . No matter what he did , it would never be good enough . Anger rose in him and quickly grew stale . He reflected that he was responsible for his part in their affairs . But why he had taken on such a role mystified him . It was extremely disheartening , and Hendersen , who was a romantic , sat for a while longer , sentimentally recalling the past and resisting an ultimate conclusion . Finally , he took himself to bed . <p> Nina was curled under the covers in a fetal posture of sleep , her hair spilled on the pillow . He lay beside her , afraid to disturb her , but he ached with a longing for which he had no name  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took a thick strand of her hair in his fingers and rubbed it , as if it were all of her , and all of him . <p> In the morning , she looked so peaceful and rosy , he wanted to let her sleep . He got the boys off to school and was eating toast and reading the paper when she came in the kitchen barefoot , wearing a robe . He noticed the slimness of her ankles and calves and the straightness of her back . <p> She moved silently around him , fixing herself some tea . She poured water from the kettle , and somehow it slipped and fell , splashing water on her feet . She cried out , and Hendersen jumped up and gripped her shoulders , thinking to help . <p> Let go , she cried , I 'm all right . <p> Your feet , you 've burned them : <p> She wrenched from his grasp and rushed to the bathroom and ran cold water in the tub . She sat on the edge , thinking he was an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with an anxious look and an ice tray , which he cracked methodically into the tub , and then he stood there waiting . <p> What ? she said . What do you want ? <p> He looked surprised . What 's going on with you ? What happened in the kitchen ? <p> I had a cramp . <p> He nodded , pursing his lips . Do you want to take a Motrin or something ? <p> She waved him away . The medicine cabinet was full of his pharmaceutical samples . I 'm not an addict , she said . <p> Hendersen frowned . What does that mean ? <p> I 'm not  --  And then she cried out in exasperation , Ohhh God ! , and leaned over clutching her knees . <p> Hendersen put his arms around her . Water was thundering into the tub . <p> She breathed as if sobbing . Please , he said , what is it ? They stayed like that until Nina calmed down and sat up and cut off the tap . Hendersen stepped away . Cramps ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maybe you should see a doctor . <p> I already have , Nina said , and there 's nothing wrong . <p> There was a noise in the hall , and they looked up to see the au pair . It was as if they had been caught in a guilty act . Hendersen made an open gesture of his hand . Everything all right ? <p> The girl smiled glumly and continued down the hall . <p> Nina stood up , and Hendersen reached for a towel . He had an impulse to bend down and dry her feet . The idea frightened him . He had no idea where it might lead . <p> Nina , he said , I 'm worried about you . <p> What exactly are you worried about ? She took the towel and began to dry her feet . They were red and bony , and it occurred to Hendersen that he had n't done anything wrong and there was no reason to keep standing there . In his mind , he began packing to leave town the next day . <p> Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting out of her chest , and to keep up , she had to move fast . She discovered that certain kinds of shy and deceptively quiet men were drawn to her without her doing anything in particular to attract them . They liked her , and that was all . <p> A month went by . Late one afternoon she ran into Rogan on the sidewalk outside the hospital . You cut your hair , he said . <p> Her hand reached up to the blunt edge . Do you like it ? <p> Yes , he said . I miss the girl , but now I see the woman . It was exactly the kind of thing Nina wanted to hear but from him suddenly felt too personal . He looked older than before , slightly stooped . She could n't imagine him touching her . <p> There was an awkward pause , and Nina said she had to go . A moment later , Rogan found himself looking back over his shoulder , thinking she had called his name  --  John . He was sure he heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teenage boys crossing the street , and one of them , a tall , skinny fellow , trailing behind on a skateboard , pushing it with hard kicks , hurrying to catch up with his friends . The first rush of evening traffic was coming up the avenue , and the cars seemed to bear down on the boy with irresistible intent . Rogan wanted to tell him not to be careless , not to be fooled into thinking life would keep pouring onto him like a gift . The boy skated safely out of the street , and the cars rushed by , creating a hot wind . <p>
