A man walks into the gallery on a sunny afternoon carrying a fistful of golf clubs . I 'm aware that there 's been some kind of traffic thing going on outside for the last few minutes , but I have n't gone to the window to check it out  --  happens all the time around here . The softening silence of the gallery is protective that way , I guess . Anyway , the guy walks in with these golf clubs , maybe four of them , looking like some kind of whacked-out classical god with thunderbolts when he steps out of the elevator . <p> It 's around four-thirty or so , maybe later  --  you lose a sense of time keeping watch over an art gallery ; Keats notwithstanding , this stuff is n't eternally on the move . Anyway , I 'm paying only scant attention because in this part of town , we get all kinds . Some you keep an eye on , to be sure , but the guy seems harmless enough , and I 've seen him around the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last resort of the rich and the homeless alike , the edge of all kinds of worlds . No , that 's too poetic . It 's just San Francisco . I suppose a lot of people have this sort of other-world , romantic idea of San Francisco , but after you live here for a while , you realize it 's just another city . Maybe we do have more than our share of crazies , people who have n't come down from that last great acid trip of ' 68 , or drifters figuring it 's warmer here and you do n't have to spend half your life looking . for a heating grate . I do n't know . There was a time I probably ascribed more meaning to the place than there is , but that was a long time ago . Maybe the only thing left to say about San Francisco is that it 's a good place to get used to most things . Some say it 's tolerance . I think it 's probably closer to indifference . Or maybe that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The place I work is called the Gallery of Western Realism . Yes , we get our fair share of tourists wandering in looking for Remington statues , but that 's not what we mean by western . It 's contemporary realism that celebrates the culture of the western U.S. , but we stop short of bronzed horseback riders . Over the years , I 've made a habit of tracing trends from one group show to the next , and I 've found that disaster seems to play a leading role . Lots of paintings of the Golden Gate snapped in the middle or a high-arched bridge on U.S. 1 ending in midair , freeways coiled like DNA and men kissing against a backdrop of crashing trains . A sense of anticipated , if not invited , disaster . I do n't know many people who sit around out here worrying about the Big One , but that 's the general impression , I guess . Mostly , we sell stuff to people from the East , and I figure it 's because it probably makes them feel comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway , I 'm behind the desk , lost in mindless thought trying not to think about Nick and , of course , thinking about nothing else , and the elevator door opens , and this guy walks into the room with the golf clubs in one hand , and he 's got a shoulder bag on the other side , sort of a Navajo tapestry thing with ratty fringe , overflowing with papers and leaflets and God knows what . The only reason I recognize him as one of the regulars among the army of homeless who work this part of the city is that his thing when you pass by is to ask for " home for the changeless . " The first time I heard that , I actually dug down and handed him a buck . <p> I 'd say he 's around thirty or thirty-five , maybe younger , kind of wild , sticky-looking hair , wire-rims on the point of his nose , but they 're pretty bent up , so they slice across his face on an angle . He 's wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aquamarine bowling shirt with the name " Sal " stitched in white over the pocket . <p> The elevator door closes behind him , and he stands there a minute and then launches himself into the gallery , marches right past the desk without even looking at me , and keeps on going until he reaches the other end of the room . He stands there a second or two , then pivots like he 's on guard duty or whatever , and strides back to the elevator . <p> I 'm watching closely now and for once really not thinking about Nick , because even though this banana seems harmless enough , he 's got those golf clubs and might all of a sudden start slashing away at the paintings with his four-iron , or whatever . But he just pushes the down button and stands there waiting , and all the time I 'm watching but trying to be a little careful about it , too  --  subtle , I mean  --  because you never know what 's going to set them off . I hear the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as the door slides open , Changeless Sal picks up one of our brochures from the Lucite holder on the wall , looks at it a minute , and then turns to me and says , without even a trace of a smile , " So , I guess realism is the theme of the day . Right ? " <p> At first , I want to chuckle , like it 's a joke or something some rich airhead might say at an opening to be clever , but then I figure we 're not chatting up Robert Hughes here , you know ? So I just smile and say , very politely , " That 's right . Realism is the theme of the day . " <p> And he nods , real serious , like he just learned something important , something momentous , and scrunches up his face like he 's thinking very carefully about what I 've said . And he gets into the elevator , and the door closes , and that 's it . <p> I sit there for a minute or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't because I almost expect the doors to open again and Changeless Sal to reappear for an update on realism . But he does n't come back , and after a while it 's almost like he was never there , like the whole scene was just something I imagined or dreamed . <p> As usual on a slow afternoon , the gallery seems more empty now than before . You get used to the solitude , then people come in and you have to interact , smile , answer questions , try not to look as though you 're listening to their whispered comments  --  and it 's a blip on the screen . So when they go , you feel the emptiness more acutely for a minute or two until you readjust to the silence . <p> I can still hear the traffic on the street , horns honking more frequently because rush hour is starting . But the sounds are soft , muffled , like they 're coming from far away . I look around at the triangles of light descending from the ceiling over the paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wall . Now I 'm thinking of Nick again , and it 's all mixed up with Changeless Sal and the golf clubs , and for a second or two , nothing makes any sense . It 's as if the order of things , the stuff you take for granted , has just gone haywire . I wish there were other people here right now , or that at least the phone would ring . I glance toward the elevator door , as if I can make it open just by looking at it . I almost expect the figures in the paintings to start whispering the way they would in some old Twilight Zone episode , telling me everything 's going to be okay again , that things will all float back down to where they belong . <p> I am thirty-one and have worked at the gallery for two years . Before that , I lived in Seattle and then in Portland . Sometimes <p> figure I 'm working my way down the coast , but until recently , I 've felt more settled in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing feels settled at all . <p> I am attractive enough , I guess  --  dark-haired , black-eyed by virtue of my father 's Armenian-born grandparents , and I work out regularly at a gym in Hayes Gulch , which is on my way home . My life is very patterned , but I like order to things . I broke up with a boyfriend I 'd been living with for three months in Portland because he never bothered to close the doors to the kitchen cabinets . No joke . Well , it did start out as a joke between us , and he 'd sometimes leave them open on purpose , just to get to me , and it did . Of course , there was a lot more to why things did n't work out , but the open cabinet doors became a symbol of everything else that was wrong . On the day he moved out , I came home to find every cabinet door in the kitchen wide open . I remember thinking there was something obscene-looking about all those gaping cabinets . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life , San Francisco would n't be the first place to come to mind . This is a city that thrives on chaos ; because people have come here to get away from so many things , there 's this kind of universal empowerment against getting locked into anything again . But what can I say ? <p> moved here with Nick , and now he 's not here , but I am , and I do the best I can to keep things together . We met in Portland , after the kitchen-cabinet boy moved out , and I needed a roommate , put an ad in the local gay paper , and he answered it . Simple . To the point . We were roommates  --  I almost said " only " roommates , but of course there was always more to the story . <p> Maybe I was always in love with Nick because being in love with Nick meant I did n't have to be in love with anyone else . I never told him , but came close enough that he probably knew . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acknowledge it , I guess . I do n't know . <p> Anyway , Nick was the kind of guy everybody falls in love with . Yes , part of that had to do with his looks . Greek on his father 's side , Czech on his mother 's , he had dark blond hair that seemed somehow black and gold at the same time , olive skin , and pale green eyes . Everything made him smile , it seemed , and whenever be smiled , you did , too . He was n't tall , but he was one of those guys who seem taller than they are , who seem to occupy more space . A presence , I guess you 'd say . I remember every feature of his face , of course , but mostly the strange delicacy of his hands , delicacy that somehow always surprised you . More than once , I watched someone talking to him , and they 'd be held for a minute or two by the smile , but then , invariably , they 'd see the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more alive in marble than they ever could have been in life . <p> Okay . More now . I 'm afraid to get involved with other men unless I really know them for a while . No , that is n't true , although it 's what I 've told myself from time to time as an excuse . It would be easy enough to say that in recent years I have learned to be very cautious about dating , and I 'm sure that would make perfect sense , given what 's going on out there , what we all know  --  our common Fear of the Great Known in the nineties . But still , it would be misleading if I said that : It would n't be the whole truth or even a very significant part of it . Death is n't what I 'm afraid of . It 's something else , something I always thought I was searching for , but I 'm not sure that 's true anymore . <p> I have said and thought and almost convinced myself in the past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is all that counts and all that really lasts . How many times did I say that to Nick , aching for him to agree but secretly relieved , I suppose , when he changed the subject ? I thought I never wanted to be one of his flings , one of his one-night stands , and the fact is that I never was . <p> I 've made love , yes , and surrendered myself to another person , and of course everyone practices safe sex , but lately , I ca n't help wondering if there 's another kind of safety going on , a kind that is n't safety at all but something that keeps us too safe . If so , Nick did n't believe in it . Nick took square aim at life without the slightest hesitation or doubt , and if he fucked up , certainly there were never apologies or regrets . I do n't mean to imply that he was a callous person , just that he did n't believe the point of it all was to think too much about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past tense , wondering if he did the right thing or if he could have made another choice . Of course , he practiced safe sex , too , but that 's not what I 'm talking about : What I 'm saying is that it never occurred to him to play it safe with life . If you did n't really know him , you might say that Nick was reckless , or that he used sex as an excuse for not falling in love and somehow missed out on something , but I do n't think I could agree with that . I think he was always in love . You can fill in the object of that sentence yourself . <p> I would ask , " Are you dating anyone special these days ? " And he 'd laugh and invariably answer , " Baby , I 'm always dating , and they 're always special . " <p> We 'd say that all the time to each other , like a private knock-knock joke . And I 'd laugh , of course , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret pain to snake through my stomach . He 'd have relationships of a sort that would last several weeks or even a couple of months , and he 'd be gone from the apartment a lot more then . After a while , I stopped feeling like I 'd been kicked in the gut , praying that they would end soon and not turn into something permanent that might crowd me out of Nick 's life . Maybe if there had been more time , that would have happened eventually . Hard to say . <p> Anyway , in between , the briefer flings came and went , and I did n't mind them as much , believe it or not , because I never figured those men had much interest in the part of Nick I wanted , the part I was always sure would one day be mine , if I could just get through , if I could just wait it out until Nick finally understood that temporary intimacy with visiting strangers was nothing compared to the kind that came with trust and abiding loyalty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the street when he 'd catch sight of a former trick walking toward him , and it would make me feel oddly secure , somehow , almost smug , the way they 'd look at each other at a distance , maybe trying to place the face atop a clothed body . And then they 'd get close enough to greet each other , maybe still not sure of the " where " or " when " but willing enough to concede the " what . " They 'd talk a minute or two about nothing at all , and I 'd be introduced but then left to stand there to study the other guy . And I 'd be thinking the two of them sounded like <p> couple of salesmen who met casually at a business convention in another city . Nick always called these encounters " the street dance of the one-night stands . " <p> But of course I would be the one walking away with Nick . The other might even take me as Nick 's lover . They 'd be wrong , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell myself I had something none of them ever could have , something that would last beyond the next morning . <p> I do n't mean to imply that I did n't have flings of my own , but sometimes I have to admit I 'd get interested in someone else only as a defense against waiting for Nick , or maybe to gauge his reaction when I told him about the really hot guy I 'd met at Badlands the night before . I would have given anything then to have seen even the slightest flicker of jealousy or regret in his face , but he 'd just laugh and clap me on the back , thrust his fist into the air , and shout , " He scores ! " like a hockey announcer . <p> Even before I or anyone else knew about Nick , I would read the paper every day and get choked up over death notices of total strangers . Yes , I would see that some had achieved certain things in their abbreviated lives , others showed promise of one kind or another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . I should be ashamed to admit that , because death is sad at any age , but it 's human nature , I guess , to feel it 's particularly cruel when it comes too early . Well , we should be used to that by now , especially in this city , but I always figured it kept me human , so I 'd put myself through the daily exercise . <p> I would study the bare facts in the obits and try to use them to flesh out a real life , kind of like those paint-by-numbers kits you 'd get as a kid . I 'd try to imagine that certain awkwardness growing up , the feeling of not fitting in somehow , then the emergence and realization , followed by a kind of explosive defiance and energy . If the obit listed a lover among the survivors , I 'd think kindly about the dead man 's family for accepting their son or brother , at least in part , for who he was . It does n't always happen that way . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off and kept away from the grieving process , as if it was all their fault somehow . <p> Now I could tell you that I went through this daily ritual in order to grieve for the injustice of it all , for life cut off at the stem , but that would only be part of it . Sure , I 'd feel sad about the obvious irony of love being the eventual cause of death , but then in my mind , I would see them couple , open to each other , these lives I had created out of the agate type on newsprint . All shame and doubt would be cast aside , all hesitation , and there was no time then , no past or future , just the bellowing , split-second now of it , and of two bodies and lives , slamming into another , leaping dancers crossing in midair , forming a connecting arc that could never be duplicated in just the same way and therefore could never be broken again , either . <p> Imagining those moments of crossing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broke my heart , but the understanding that even though at least one of them was dead now , they had been more alive than I had ever been or maybe ever could be . I envied the dead for having lived , but my safe heart slept on while I kept telling myself I was waiting for Nick . <p> Nick told me he was sick on a September afternoon in Golden Gate Park while we stood by a wire fence , watching , sleepy-eyed buffaloes munching grass and lifting their tails to piss from time to time . I do n't know why he picked that time or place . Knowing Nick , he probably did n't give it much thought . <p> Maybe I should n't have been surprised at the news , but of course you always are . I felt my body give way and my forehead press into the fence , my eyes pinch shut against the damned , irretractable fact of it . I almost wished the fence wire would cut into the skin of my forehead , as if real physical pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest . <p> I turned to hold him , but I could feel his body tense up , so I stepped back . And I remember taking a very deep breath and then trying to say some hopeful things , but they all sounded lame . I was trying hard to be what I thought Nick wanted me to be , but then I lost it , and it was Nick 's turn to hold me and tell me it was okay , that it was just the luck of the draw or some such . I suppose , for him , it was okay , in a way , because he 'd never been afraid of living , so why should he be unduly afraid of dying ? <p> We sat down on the bench facing the buffalo pen and talked or did n't . In time , we even found a few funny , macabre things to say . And then there were these long silences with words swirling in my mind , but they would n't settle down into sentences the way I wanted them to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I 'd stick by him , because I remember him saying , " I know . " Finally , it was getting dark and too cold to stay there anymore , so we got up and started back to the car . <p> I remember how Nick laughed a little as we set out and said something about how he always used to think as a kid that all the buffaloes had been killed off . It was something he believed growing up in the East , that they were almost extinct except for a very few that he 'd seen once in the zoo in Buffalo , New York . Of course , he 'd learned otherwise somewhere down the line , but still he said he 'd been surprised when he first moved to San Francisco to find a small herd of them calmly grazing and pissing in Golden Gate Park . <p> " Reports of their demise were greatly exaggerated , " I remember him saying in a phony Mark Twain Southern accent . I think he was trying to break the tension  --  Nick was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't remember . <p> Nick died last month . You would n't say it was a peaceful or noble death if you had been there and did n't know him . And yet , because of the way he lived his life , I guess it was both of those things for those of us who loved him . No , he did not go gently , even when there was so little of him left to keep fighting . Pictures of every hour and minute are burned into my memory , and I do n't think they 'll ever fade . I thought I would be haunted by them above all , but if you 've ever lost someone from your life , you know that something much worse takes over , a hole in the middle of you deeper and darker than anything you could have imagined . There are even times when you 'd give anything just to relive that last second together , no matter how awful it was , because even the worst moment is better than knowing there will never be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could , and finally near the end , they just gave me a leave from the gallery because I was n't doing much good there anyway . I 'd take care of the medical stuff , attach the new IV bags when it was time , make sure the refrigerator was well-stocked with syringes , change the bedding several times a day . It helped to have visitors , if only because there 'd be someone else to share waiting for him to wake up for a while . And Nick knew everybody in town , so thank God there were a lot of visitors . At last , I was n't jealous of sharing my time with him . <p> If I had to be out of the apartment for any period of time , Nick would write notes for me and leave them scattered among the pill bottles next to the bed  --  sometimes just reminders of things that needed doing , people who had to be contacted , silly things he 'd seen on a talk show that afternoon . Other times , he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home later , and he 'd be asleep , it was almost like we were having a conversation . <p> The other thing he had , on the table next to the bed , was this stupid poetry box someone had given him a long time ago . It 's a long wooden box with eight cubes in it and a separate word in different typefaces on each side of the cube , so you can make up sentences depending on how you arrange the cubes . Sometimes , Nick would leave me a message , usually suggestive , before he went to sleep at night , so I 'd find it when I came in later to check on him . At other times , visitors would play with it while they sat there waiting for Nick to wake up . <p> I did n't pay attention to it over the final weeks , but then , when it was over , and we were cleaning things up , I noticed it : " GOD-*%# , ?  --  please  --  do  --  everything  --  to  --  TRUST  --  love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with the poetry box when they came to visit , so I do n't even know for sure that it was Nick 's arrangement , but obviously I like to think it was . <p> I wish I could say now that I learned what Nick tried to teach me by the example of his life . I wish I could say I so envied him for having truly lived that I have finally broken free of this half-life safety , that I have finally stopped waiting , or that I think I can at least try to break free as time goes on . <p> Mostly , since Nick died , I 've tried to get through from one day to the next . I do n't read the paper every morning : anymore and cry over strangers , so maybe that 's a good thing . I have a real loss to try to make sense of , I guess . I go to the gallery , I work out , I see people , but I 'm still waiting  --  at least for the time when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do think about moving , to another apartment at least , another job , another city , but it 's too soon to make those kinds of decisions . I guess I 'd think about the job thing first , because the real problem with the one I have now is that I have too much time to think about things . It 's not as though I spend all day smothering in a cloud of grief . Actually , I sometimes feel very pissed off at Nick , because wishing he 'd never come into my life in the first place is easier than wishing he 'd never left it . <p> Is that bad ? Maybe , but it 's how I feel . <p> Anyway , at the end of the day , I do the close-up routine at the gallery  --  answering machine set , security system activated , lights dimmed on my way out . <p> I did go back to the park a couple of weeks ago , just that one time , maybe in an attempt to focus or something . I stood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I thought I 'd find some comfort in knowing they are n't extinct after all , that life goes on , or that I would look at the high fence that keeps the buffaloes safe and remember Nick and the feel of the wire pressing into my forehead that day . I sat for a while on the bench where we 'd sat , wondering things like how long a fingerprint lasts on painted wood , but I did n't focus anything or feel anything I have n't felt every minute since Nick died . And the fact is that right now , at least , I do n't give a shit that life goes on and the buffaloes are still safe in their pen . <p> There 's still a trace of daylight when I leave the gallery and start walking toward the subway . I know I should go to the gym , but there 's time for that later . There are so many people on the sidewalks , it 's hard to move , but I 'm in no hurry . I remember one other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , not too long after we 'd moved here , how he 'd laughed and said , " Imagine if all these people were insects with silk threads coming out of their butts . How long do you think it would take to sew up the whole city like a cocoon ? " It was just some silly , throwaway thing he said , but I often seem to remember it when I leave the gallery at night and the sidewalks are crowded . When you lose someone from your life , you want to remember some big important thing they said , but sometimes all you come up with are throwaway lines . <p> What I am also thinking about now , walking along , is the banana with the golf clubs , wondering if I 'll run into him at his usual spot on the corner . Good old Changeless Sal . I look , but he is n't there , and I find myself wondering where he 's gone , how he lives when he 's not asking for " home for the changeless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked when I assured him that realism was the theme of the day , I ca n't help feeling a little envious . It 's not like how I used to feel about Nick 's life or even the lives I used to make up to go along with the obit data in the morning paper . But still , there 's this odd connection in my head somehow . Maybe it 's hard to see the point , but at this moment , at least , I think about the crazy guy and how his head is all mixed up , how he lives on some separate plane from the rest of us where nothing we probably think of as " normal " ever registers or is acknowledged . And one day he comes into an art gallery with his golf clubs , asks a simple question , gets an answer , and leaves . Bingo . His day is made . And when he 's outside again , the world might still seem pretty mixed up to him , but maybe not entirely . It may make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a bitch has been given one small answer , one tiny truth , and no matter how crazy it gets for him later on , maybe he can hold on to that just for a while . <p> I 'd give anything for that . <p>
