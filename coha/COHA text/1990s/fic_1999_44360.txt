What price is too high for a species " ultimate desire ? <p> To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom . - Bertrand Russell was assigned a rescue mission deep into unknown space . That simple assignment nearly destroyed the human race . The Alliance sent Marines instead of ambassadors-a seemingly sensible gesture since the galaxy 's been in various states of war for two centuries . We turned out to be the exact wrong people for the original mission , yet the exact right people for what the mission became . My boat fell into normal space at the coordinates where the Halifax , an ill-fated interstellar survey vessel , had reported discovering a camouflaged world . Alliance brass assumed the survey craft had stumbled upon a pirate stronghold and been captured ; that 's what such disappearances usually meant . Ryon 312-D-the planet 's interim designation-was visible only because of what was invisible . As the boat slowed to orbital velocity , swooping around an orb of darkness , background stars melted from sight aft and new ones appeared fore . Guidance told us we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravgauge told us that something massed .71E . I gave the order to engage the descent program . We were to duplicate the missing vessel 's every move , though with a bit more confidence : The Yantic was not a fragile survey craft , but an older T2-Mk. 1 armored Marine transport with room for the nine of us and a dozen more , in case we found survivors . What 's more , the old bird had been retrofitted based on the Halifax 's final reports ; they had been scientists until the end , detailing the loss of their vessel . At thirty-one kilometers , we came up against a barrier that acted like a balloon around the world , repelling and deflecting the boat without damage . Ship 's computers studied the phenomenon , telling us nothing useful except that we had lost twenty-one percent power while in contact with the barrier . " Maybe it 's some kind of huge energy field , " my pilot , Movi , suggested . I did n't care what it was , I just wanted through it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to plan B. " He smiled , nodded inside his helmet , and turned to his control panel . The railgun belowdecks thumped and made the deck shudder . Then the systems began to fail . My soldiers reported loss of power to weapons , then main drive , then secondary systems . We fell into the gravity well . This time the barrier only slowed our descent as artificial night swallowed us . My mind sharpened , knowing our real work was getting close : we 'd soon be down among the hostiles , something more familiar to a Marine than sitting helpless in zero-g . At seventeen kilometers above the still-invisible surface , the Halifax 's final reported altitude , we lost communications . Our suit telltales blinked off , the combat and nav computers forgot what they were thinking , and the vessel 's countless screens and indicators faded to pale LCDs and blank holopanels . Winds buffeted the hull . " All systems down , Captain , " Movi said . Her voice was muffled by her helmet , but our suits were designed so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems are n't engaging . Even the backup computers have gone to sleep . " She lifted her hands from the controls , looked at me , and shrugged . " Fire the chemical rocket , " I ordered . She nodded and reached for the ignition lever bolted crudely over a hole torched in the deck . The crew was a standard mix of jarheads ; " expendable " must have been the official designation on some Alliance database . Before Movi pulled the lever , I sensed sweat and silence , heard only the wind and the wheeze of anxious breath through my Marines " respirators . The suits were old tech , but I 'd picked them since they could operate without power : Just inhale hard and you get air , just urinate and a bag beside your leg collects the warm stuff . The rocket blazed to life beneath us . Ha ! I thought . Bet you did n't expect ancient-tech backup , eh ? To hell with you pirate bastards . But the laughs were on me : A few seconds later , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . I 'm glad she did n't ; I would have bitten off her head . How in hell could they shut down a chemical reaction ? There 's nothing like fear of the unknown to piss off a Marine . Then the dark shroud around the boat vanished , and a watery world appeared through the ports . My crew of eight Marines " breath heaved as one-slow , deep and hollow in their suits while we freefell toward a world whose homogeneous dark blue was broken only by paler shaDows and occasional green blemishes . We were 104 light-years from the nearest Kosmos Marines " base , we had no power , and the rocket that the brains in Engineering installed had only burned for a tiny fraction of the time it was guaranteed to run . I heard the crew 's breath stop for a moment , waiting , perhaps , as I was for Death to crash through the hull , fire and bones , perhaps riding a horse with skin made of interwoven energy beams , as in the nightmare I had so often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scared . Alliance brass had expected anything and had armored the boat against all but the heaviest weapons . But nothing violent happened , at least not for a time much longer than a human can hold his breath . During that long silence , Movi could n't restart the rocket . She finally turned a blank face toward me , shaking her head inside her helmet . I nodded , acting confident that everything was unfolding exactly as expected . We were soon gripped in a forcefield the Halifax had n't been able to report . I felt a sort of chill . . . we were up against planetary defenses of a kind I 'd never before seen . It seemed as if a vast , gentle fist dragged us across the sky . The boat continued to fall-though I was certain something was causing us to decelerate-at a steep angle toward the endless sea . Approximately ten kilometers above that ocean , I ordered the crew to brace for impact , knowing the precautions the engineers had taken at Base Station would have little effect if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Davis . He did n't need to elaborate . Staring out the fore port as ocean rapidly grew to encompass the entire view , we could make out artificial shapes in the water . At about five kilometers , they resolved into spaceships " hulls , split and discolored , strewn amid rocks as if this place had seen a great battle . Oddly , I could only see one area of concentrated ship graveyard , while the rest of the water was clear and uncluttered ; this spot appeared to be the outlet of an invisible funnel from space . At a thousand meters and falling , I do n't imagine my crew paid much attention to anything but how well their crash-webbing would hold . " Prepare for hardland , " I ordered , then we hit the water . Impact was milder than I 'd feared , even though we 'd been decelerating . I guessed the rocket had done its job . During the downtime we 'd spent en route to Ryon-D , I 'd imagined a thousand different endings to a meteoric descent , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we struck the ocean 's surface-crash-bubbles inflating via compressed air-then continued down like a spear thrown at a fish until we hit bottom . The sea was unexpectedly shallow , perhaps a hundred meters deep , the floor carpeted with a sort of mossy growth that transformed into black clouds as we tore through into the sand beneath . I got a brief glimpse of what looked like the ruins of a sunken city , but , whatever it was , it was buried in drowned space vessels . A sick grinding rang through the Yantic as the hull scoured against the sand , rebounded , and then the boat floated to the surface and began to bob , gently . Our crash bubbles deflated . However , if the leaks were any indication , the Yantic had taken the hit harder than we had . " Marines ! " I shouted , disentangling myself from the webbing , " check your suits and prepare for aquatic combat . Keep your arms on safety . Prepare to repel boarders . " Movi ! Take &squad; and secure all leaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Check the arms locker and make sure everyone has working gear . " Hakim and Davis ! Drop something for an anchor . I want this boat upright and stable . " Malkov and the rest of A-squad ! Prepare the water raft and get our gear ready to go out there and find the enemy . All of you , move , now ! " While my soldiers rushed to their business , brushing against one another in the cramped confines of the vessel , I peered through the fore and aft ports , starved for tactical data . All I could see were those derelicts as we floated on the waves , half submerging as crests washed over our hull . The ships protruding above the surface were vast , all larger than a Monte Carlo class cruiser , some bigger than a Chaos-Times dreadnought . They 'd have to be big in order to rest on the bottom and rise into the sky like metal islands , volcanoes , rotting fists . One mountain of a ship was so ancient it looked like little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might be leaking , but we were better off than the other ships . Maybe forty vessels broke the ocean swells , a few alternately disappearing and reappearing as waves passed over their sunken hulls . Who knows how many more were buried at sea , too small or too rusted to be seen . All stood in various stages of damage and decomposition , some crinkled lengthwise and split open at every seam , others torn and folded into origami shapes , still others barely ruined but enamelled with centuries of organisms and rot . And not a one recognizable as belonging to the Kosmos Marines . A few looked like the types of craft fielded in the Chaos Times , but most looked like nothing I 'd ever seen , and I 've become pretty famil iar with warships during seventeen years of service . Also sprinkled among that graveyard were rocks , big rocks . Not islands , no ; they were too uniform . They looked like asteroids , perhaps fired in anger at this world . One , which rose at least fifty meters above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I saw the curve of its underside before the waves hid it , like a god 's ball set near the wrecked ships , like a tombstone . If we had hit that instead .... " Captain ! - Hakim said . " Look ! " A small , alien figure approached . When I say that , I do n't mean it was riding in a raft or anything . It simply floated toward us on air , walking on water without even moving its feet . As it approached , I could resolve a simple torso , somewhat round , about the size of a human child 's ; head and neck much like a human 's in proportion to body but hairless ; no shoulders , but two long and spindly arms ended in what looked more like lace handkerchiefs than hands ; two short legs ended in stubby flippers . When it stopped , about ten meters from where we bobbed on gentle swells , it settled into what might have been a seated position and closed its two great eyes . I could n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could n't even see its thin mouth at that moment ; its skin was completely smooth , dark brown with a blue tint . I applied the sex of female to it , out of habit and since she just sort of . . I do n't know , seemed more female than male . It appeared that we were n't dealing with pirates , after all . The mission was getting more and more interesting all the time . I hoped we would survive this , if only because a first encounter with a new species can make an officer 's career . " What now , Captain ? " Malkov asked . gA-squad , we 're going outside to say hello , " I said . " We have a first-contact here , so hold your fire unless fired upon . " I tried to ignore the Yantic 's condition and concentrated on our primary objectives , rescuing the lost explorers and finding out why the locals had wrecked the Halifax and stranded us . Did they have their eyes on human holdings in nearby space ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this floating creature was an example of the dominant , native lifeform-a Ryonian , I decided to call her . " We have to try to communicate with this . . . Ryonian , " I said . Silently , I damned the otherwise-thorough planners for not including a xenolinguist in my crew . I assigned B-squad to remain with Movi and repair the boat while ordering the four others to exit with me . When we cranked open the outer hatch , the lock flooded with water ; Mk. 1 transports have their locks underdecks , so we emerged several meters underwater . After some awkward maneuvering in our heavy suits , we shoved out the rubber raft and gripped its handrail as one of the squad activated the raft 's inflators . It buoyed us up along the dented armor of the Yantic to the surface . Two soldiers rowed as another steered us toward the alien ; A-squad leader , Coleman , sat at ready , chemical pistol in hand . I noticed a haziness , about ten meters in diameter , enclosing the Ryonian , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten the creature in any way , but as soon as we got near the bubble , we all were slugged with blinding headaches that blotted out vision and sent our thoughts down the way of dreams . I imagined I was talking to someone , only I had no idea what I was saying or to whom . I felt alternately that I was back at primary school , then the university , then the academy and suit camp , working on school lessons and practicing combat . Soon I went to war again , fighting crazy rebels and pirates . Based on how far we 'd drifted , the headache and dreams could n't have lasted more than a minute ; still , it felt as if days or years had passed . When my mind was mine again , I surveyed the squad sprawled about the raft , gripping their helmets as if they could massage their throbbing skulls through the shatterproof plastic and carbonate armor . Before I could react , Coleman raised his pistol and fired at the alien . Belatedly , I tore the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel in a puff of exhaust . It screamed toward the alien only a few meters away , then began to slow instead of accelerate . Its tiny motor flared in place for several seconds before burning out , and the projectile fell harmlessly into the rolling waters . I turned to Coleman . " Vacuum-head ! " I shouted . " What were you thinking ? Never act except on your superior 's orders . This is not a battle situation . Take an oar from Kaplan , now ! " Just as he and the other Marine stood to swap places , an invisible hand ripped the pistol from my grip , hurled it thirty meters through the air , and slammed it against the fallen asteroid . Then Coleman grabbed his chest and began yanking at his suit 's tubes and switches . He opened his life-support casing and seized the oxygen regulator . " Coleman , cut that crap out ! " I shouted , my voice suspended on the thin edge between anger and fear . I automatically reached for the dangling hoses , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You fool ! What 're you doing ? " In a spasm , he twisted toward me , his face a blue mask , eyes bulging , lips pressed inward , nostrils compressed , blood popping in droplets against the faceplate . That sort of thing only happens in extremely hostile environments , not on gentle worlds like Ryon-D . I reached for him , but his body was yanked from my grasp and slammed into the water so hard that his helmet shattered and his body armor blasted across the surface for several meters before sinking . He vanished beneath the waves at the base of the great , round tombstone . It would have been futile to send a rescue team down after him . " Captain , " someone said . The voice sounded awfully clear without a helmet mic . " You will leave soon . " " Who is that ? " I shouted . Things had gotten out of control , and I was beginring to have trouble reasoning . " Since you name things , call me Sacra , " the speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . " Something about the sound of the voice made me look at the Ryonian . " You , " I said , pointing at the little- creature squatting just centimeters above the water , wavepeaks splashing her folded flippers . She raised both long arms above her head , lacy hands fluttering . " I. " " Captain . . ? " one of the soldiers began . I blinked . " How 'd you learn to speak my language ? " I asked . " From you , " Sacra said . From me ? " When did I teach you anything ? " There followed a long pause . A hundred meters behind her , a bird thing swooped down to the water from a wrecked vessel and returned with a fish in its beak . " You are quite primitive , " Sacra said . That kind of comment usually pisses off a Marine-we may be grunts , but we 're also educated , state-of-the-art , unlike the soft half of our Citizens-yet I 'd had specific instructions on how to deal with intelligent aliens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior races and then leave them alone . " As soon as you entered my personal sphere , " she said , " you began to share with me what you know . I severed the connection before I was severely injured . It is psychologically damaging and physically painful to learn the ways of your kind , so I have decided you must leave . I can not allow anyone else 's sphere to touch you , especially not that of the larvae , and you are near them . I must take you away . " " Wait , " I said . " We 're on a mission . We came a long way to rescue- " " Those you seek are - not here . Tell your companions to evacuate your spacecraft and join you . I have decided- " " Wait ! " I said , balancing between violent anger at her attack and the kind of patience officers are taught to use when confronting new alien species . " Notify your authorities that we need to speak to someone in command . " I am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated . I clenched my jaw a few times , considering . No leader would enter a dangerous situation without a division of guards , right ? " I do n't believe you , " I said . " We have no unbalanced government such as you burden yourselves with , " she said . " We have lived satisfying lives for . . . seventeen thousand of your years with no governments such as you serve , such as have nearly destroyed your civilizations . But I am the protector . I , alone among those still on my world , bear personality-scars from encounters with dangerous beings like you . For twelve of your centuries , I have been a protector , and they have been lonely years . Intruders are my only company , and a peaceful intruder is as rare as a supernova . Super novas are the pinnacle of violence , yet they are the ultimate force of creation . You see my position . " She stopped speaking and turned her face upward , toward the small , hot disk of the sun sinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at us , her deep eyes absorbing mine . " There will be no more discussion . I can not permit you to come into contact with the others and infect their minds . " My face burned , my fists hardened , my back tightened-especially on the left side where a fused bulkhead had slammed me long ago , during combat with a Marine ship stolen by pirates . I relived that fight again , only for a moment , but long enough to realize my damned mind had gotten raw , loosened since our encounter with Sacra . That little Ryonian had decided we were to leave before we even had a chance to accomplish our objectives . And after wrecking my boat and killing Coleman . Granted , Coleman had fired first , but I 'm responsible for my crew , even for hot-headed fools like Coleman . You ca n't ignore something like that , even if you command different crews each mission . " And if I refuse ? " I asked , keeping in mind the power she held over us . Waves splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made no sudden moves . " You have no choice . " I realized it would be fruitless to argue further . Could Sacra be threatened with violence ? No . Coleman attested to that . Surely , she could defend herself against our personal weapons with that protective field . Could she kill us if we attacked hand-to-hand ? It drove me crazy that I could be so easily manipulated by such a slight creature , to be surrounded by power which I could n't lay my hands on or even understand ; where was it , underwater ? And how did she control it , telepathically ? I glanced at the spaceship graveyard around us ; the Ryonians possessed the capability to bring down craft as big as our heaviest dreadnoughts . So much I needed to learn : How did their control fields operate ? What was the energy source ? Where was the Halifax and its crew ? Whose wrecks were these ? How long had they been there ? Did they belong to the races that were now covertly invading the edges of Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours that crashed here 220 days ago ? " " The vessel is one kilometer southwest , " she said . " The crew is gone . " " What " Do not ask any more questions , " Sacra interrupted . gI am severing communication with you . " " Not just yet , " I said . I thought it would be to our advantage to play a wild card . Because she had revealed what kind of danger we were to her people , I realized the Ryonians could be threatened , if not with violence , then with something more dangerous . It came to me all of a sudden , a flash of insight , an islet of rationality jutting out of a sea of fury . Power over , not overpowered . I smiled as I prepared to play the game . I saw it as the only way to accomplish our mission , and I always completed my missions . My bluff assumed she had no way to read our minds without our knowing it ; that is , without feeling a whopping headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind she had picked through did n't contain information that would work against me . " If it 's so burning important that you get us off your world , " I said , " how would you feel if I said that hundreds more ships will be arriving soon unless you cooperate ? I 'm sure you could kill any of us with a wish , the way you killed Coleman , but could you handle hundreds of ships and thousands of soldiers at once ? And even if you could , would n't our minds contaminate the rest of your people ? How does that compare to a few Marines looking for a few stranded civilian explorers ? " Sacra did n't answer immediately , but it was obvious she had heard . I was suddenly aware of the air 's pungent , briny scent . Sacra 's eyes stared unblinkingly at me , great black orbs embedded in a round face . Then her lips parted slightly , revealing a slit just beneath the eyes . Sacra spoke from that mouth now . " That is sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old instructor 's , " and it is a lie . But it is also more true than you believe . I had hoped I misunderstood your psychology . There is nothing more important to me in my role as sentinel than keeping my people from contact with races like yours . " Long ago , we were much like you : aggressive , hungry , violent . Now they are peaceful and content . I am what you would call a pervert , an evolutionary throwback , else I would be unable to perform my . . . unfortunate duties while remaining functionally sane . But I have grown weary of communicating with you . Your race is more ill than any I have encountered before . We must leave . I have a mission of my own to complete now " The words wavered , like a sob . But who can guess the emotion of an alien ? Still , her speech created an ache inside me , opened up a wound where I had never thought to armor myself : in my heart . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my own emotions were raw after she had torn them open . " Listen , " I said . " All you need to do is lead us to the people we 're looking for and we 'll lift off . Well , as soon as we repair our boat . We 'll leave you alone , and the fleet will have no reason to invade . You wo n't have to worry about us if you just lead us to our comrades . " My answer came not in words but in action : the Yantic split open , stem to stern , and the four Marines inside floated up and out of the sinking , bubbling hulk like cats lifted by the scruffs of their necks . We aboard the raft , too , were lifted into the air , something firm yet invisible pressing against the soles of my boots . When I looked down , I noticed that the bubble which encompassed Sacra had grown to surround us as well , so that we stood on its inner surface . If I had to guess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Yantic had rebounded against in the upper atmosphere . " We leave now , " said Sacra , and so we did . A momentary sense of dizziness swept through me , and when I regained full awareness , we floated a meter above the weed-choked terrain of a planet lit by an orange sun . Instantaneous interstellar travel .... I stood in silent awe of her race 's power and found it impossible to imagine what it would be like to engage her kind in combat . Then Sacra 's personal sphere shrank , and we eight humans fell to the ground . " This is an uninhabited world outside of what you call Alliance space . You can survive here , but you will not be able to tell your people what you 've learned . I leave now . " " Wait ! " I shouted , angry and confused . I had threatened her with what seemed to be the worst evil she could imagine , yet her response was to bring us to a habitable world rather than permanently silence us . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated her with disrespect . " I want to let you know that my threat was n't real , " I said . UI do n't have the power to order such an attack . Let your people know that I wo n't recommend it , either ; in fact , I 'll tell my superiors to leave your world alone . You wo n't have to worry about us . " " Perhaps . . . " Sacra said with her mouth . Something about how she said it gave me hope . Then she looked at the sky again , an alien sky and an alien , orange sun , and I wondered what she saw . I heard muted thunder . She said , " Ah , but it does not matter , Captain . " Her words fell quiet , soft , like delicate living things fluttering from her lips . Each word aroused a great sadness within me . It was as if I could feel her emotions as she spoke . Which , I guess , might have been so . " The first scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Your tenacity and sheer numbers will make it impossible for us to avoid learn ing your warlike ways . My people can not bear to live through another age of wars as we once did . We sentinels , alone among all the living , remember that time . My people barely survived our internal strife . We exterminated whole species , sterilized planets . And now . . . " The other old sentinels like me are . . . away on duty . I can not permit the wars to return , so now I have a duty , as well . This is a sad day , a very sad day . " Then her eyes closed and she was about to do something-what ? Were we to die , right here , far from our families , where they could never mourn us ? I felt my heart throb , imagining it was about to burst . What had I done ? I sensed that we stood on the cleft of some grand change , some nightmare I had brought about , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagined it was about to crack open and spill my brains into my suit . I felt a thousand ills at once , each one a death to silence me forever about the Ryonians . But suddenly , my upset gave way to terror as her emotions spilled over into my mind and I understood that the terror I felt was hers . Whether this mental communication was intentional or driven by the depths of her sorrow , I could n't tell . No , my crew and I were not to die . It would not matter if we were silenced , killed . Sacra had recognized my threatening words as truer than I imagined : If we did not return with the crew of the Halifax , more Marines would be dispatched to find out why . And the next missions would n't arrive in piddly-ass armored transports ; no , they 'd show up around Ryon-D in state-of the-art destroyers , dreadnoughts , and eventually planet-busters bearing tens of thousands of fighting men and women . Surely those ships-or most of them ; I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky and swamped in the sea . But there would be survivors . She recognized , through me , that the missions would never cease , and soon warriors would swarm across the surface of Ryon D .... It would n't matter if our weapons were impotent , for our true weapons lurked within our skulls . What petrified Sacra was that the Ryonians would learn the qualities that go into developing a lifer-Marine . They would learn the pitiless , amoral resolve necessary to execute a combat mission ; they would learn the motives for war , the why . They would learn what it takes to kill a person or a ship full of them without allowing it to haunt you throughout your life . They would learn . . . well , the thrill of crashing through death and coming out on the other side , of killing and not getting killed , of emerging from a glowing cloud of shattered battleships in one piece . In short , they would relearn everything they were hiding from , what had once made them monsters . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would happen regardless of whether my crew and I survived . And letting my crew return would be just as bad for the Ryonians " isolation . The terror was not mine , I knew : I feared not for myself , nor for my crew ; a Marine is always prepared to die , from the moment he or she steps out of suit camp until an enemy vessel bears down , cannon blazing , missiles launched like ambassadors of death . And a captain must be prepared to watch his crew perish in combat-else what good is he ? I certainly did n't worry about the additional scar we 'd inflicted on Sacra by our mere presence ; that was just the price she paid in her duty , just as death is a Marine 's price . Nor , I must admit , did I care that we threatened to damage her people 's minds . Those things were all terrible enough , I guess . But the terror she shared with me ran deeper . What was it ? " Sacra , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared ? " The thunder was growing closer . I felt a chill breeze . " You humans view any alien power as a threat , even-or perhaps especially-other human powers . So , too , was it for us during our violent times . But we had no aversion to xenocide . " Fury poured out of her now , and the rest of my crew fell into the weeds , clutching their helmets . " Do you know what my duty is when I find races such as yours ? I have avoided it whenever possible , disposing of scouts and explorers so their people would not learn of us . But that is only a stalling tactic . " Captain , " she said , floating nearer me , hands fluttering fast , " it is now my duty to locate each and every cell of humanity by stripping your minds of information , and then to scour worlds clean of your presence just as you scour space vessels clean of alien viruses and bacteria after planetary duty . " She closed her eyes and floated several paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If what she 'd said was true .... There is nothing we could do to stop a force which can turn our best weapons and fighting ships into mere collections of junk , which can make our bodies revolt violently from within . A small voice in my head said , " Do you understand my feelings now ? I . . . must . . . go . " The last she said so slowly and with such a burden of hopelessness that I could hardly speak . " Sacra , " I shouted , panicking , " listen to me . " She opened her eyes and stared into mine . " What is it ? " she spoke , quietly , using her mouth . " We must save both our races from the nightmare you describe . You 're more ethical than this so-called duty ; I mean , you try to hide your world , you land invaders without harm , you move intruders like us to where we ca n't talk to our people . Everything you do minimizes the murder you must commit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was as if a ship slammed into my chest , hurling me to the dirt . I felt a surge of hatred and grief stronger than any before ; now I recognized these emotions as not my own . When my sight cleared , I stood , undaunted by her power , awaiting her reply . " No , Captain , " she said , " I loathe my duty . " " Then , " I said , playing a new hand that could doom the entire galaxy , " you are not the throwback you think you are , after all , are you ? I know your race 's powers seem godlike compared to ours , yet at the same time your people 's morality seems no better than a dangerous child 's . " My Marines stared at me in disbelief . Sacra revealed no reaction and projected no emotions . At least she was listening . I hurried on with my explanation . " Who is the real danger ? You , yourself , said you can not permit your people to associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So your race is only better than ours through ignorance . " The era of peace is over for your people , Sacra , " I stated , pointing at the sky . " The barbarians of the galaxy are growing up and taking to the space lanes . Tens of billions of humans live on thousands of worlds across the galactic arm , and it 's only a matter of years before your region of space will teem with our vessels , then the next species ' , then the next . A few thousand years , and the galaxy will be crowded with intelligent , spacefaring races . You can not remain isolated for long . " Now I pointed at her , the anger I felt my own . " Can you stomach that level of extermination ? Can you murder a billion trillion people , a million intelligent species , all merely to preserve your race 's ignorance ? " Sacra 's eyes closed ; I was afraid that signified resignation , that it meant " yes . " My heart felt as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing now loomed high over the horizon , profiling the tiny alien in orange clouds . " Captain , " Sacra finally said , " again you speak the truth . " Her eyes flashed open , and I felt her fury once more . " Yet you have no right to speak to me as you have . You-whose entire life could fit into one moment of mine-are incapable of fathoming what my duty has cost me and the other sentinels . I have wallowed in the rot of a thousand alien minds , I have swum in oceans of blood , and I have not emerged unchanged , untainted . " Her hands rose above her head and fluttered like scarves in a wind . " Yet , through sharing their horrors and performing my own , " she continued , gI have learned the value of peace in a way the rest of my people-who live in perpetual peace-cannot imagine . I have lived more than ten of your lifetimes . You are the infant . " She closed her eyes , and her mouth fell open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes opened , and I felt anger mounting in her greater than before , but not the aimless energy of hate ; it was more like the anger one feels when about to begin the final assault against a nearly impregnable fortress . I could feel her preparing for her loathsome duty . " Sacra ! I shouted . " Why must it always be this way ? If you have changed so much during your centuries as sentinel , how can you still believe in your . . . disgraceful duty ? Most of the time , I solve problems without firing a weapon . I 'm a soldier and do n't pretend to be any kind of planetary guardian ; that 's for the administrators to take care of . I just command special mission crews . But if I , whose job it is to kill , can execute my duty without force , then surely you can , too . " Rain began to rush down into the tall weeds close enough for us to hear . The breeze whistled across my faceplate . Sacra rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before . The emotions she had been pouring out dwindled ; soon , all that remained of our telepathic link was a pounding headache . I felt afraid again , this time my own emotion : Was she going to leave us here , impotent and useless , while she went off and erased humanity from the galaxy ? " You are right , Captain , " she said . " The price for my people 's ignorance is too high . Too many new races are arising . Xenocide on the scale you describe in this age of new sentiences is unacceptable . " I have a new duty . I will collect the other sentinels from their distant duties , and I will share with them our conversation . Then we will teach the rest of our people . " It will be a time of revolution , a terrible time , thanks to you . " I felt a trace of her anger again as she accused me . " But this price will at last be acceptable . " Then she smiled . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain-since a smile is such a human thing , so ungainly on her flat face . Sacra gave us another ride , to Kosmos Marines High Command . There , the Galactic Alliance Security Board , in private session , agreed to carry out my recommendation and shroud the Ryon 312 system in a complete travel ban until the Ryonians decide to enter galactic society . In return , Sacra promised that neither she nor the other sentinels would weed Humanity from the galaxy . After witnessing a demonstration of her destructive power directed at what had previously been a decommissioned carrier , the Board considered the deal a fair one . I wonder how galactic policy will change . I wonder if it will in the long run , if we can survive our own fear of one another and the other alien empires . So now I am Captain of First Kosmos Marines Outpost , Second War Wing , Ryon 312 Division . My first permanent dirt job in twelve years . Two cutters patrol the system , though their crews have no idea why . Down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert planet and-when the digging shift is done-monitor the system for intruders or keep our heavy antispacecraft weapons tuned up . A handful of us-we eight who were n't allowed back into the regular Marines since we knew too much-try to figure out what we witnessed , try to imagine what must be happening on Sacra 's World , which is what we now call Ryon-D . Though we 're here until retirement , our morale is good . I mean , how many jarheads can say they saved the whole human race ? Or that they nearly destroyed it . Either , I guess , is something for which High Command would award a medal . Sacra 's decision to force her people to mature must be a mighty burden . I wonder what the inside of her mind must be like , how dark it must have grown haul ing trash and then incinerating it , how ten lifetimes of the worst imaginable Special-Ops work must feel . Dark , yes , but perhaps more enlightened than any ten humans could hope to be . On long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe to emerge from my underground command to watch snakelike things race across the ocean-sized deserts of Ryon-C , I picture Sacra sitting in her ethereal bubble , a world away , contemplating me and my species as her own writhes in labor pains or war or both . I imagine her dreaming of a dayperhaps far distant , perhaps never to arrive-when the Ryonians emerge from their shroud , still godlike yet cleansed of their murderous fear . Perhaps , on that day , the few surviving races who crashed those alien spacecraft into her oceans will join us in a more civilized alliance of species . Hell , maybe on that day our own race will treat itself . . . humanely . I picture Sacra smiling , a lipless gesture more like a child 's pencil rendition than a real smile , reaching her handkerchief hand out through the blackness between the stars , to touch the hand of a changed human , one perhaps entirely unlike me . Then there will be no need for people like me , nor Ryonians like Sacra . READERS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact at your favorite retailer , we want to help .
