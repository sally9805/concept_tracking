A rediscovered work by a modern master of the American theater <p> Characters : Lemuel Gulliver : a shipwrecked sea captain , forty-six Mistress Berlinda Jenkins : a commoner , eighteen Lady Sibyl Ponsonby : a noble lady , twenty-four The Duke of Cornwall : the island 's governor , twenty-eight Simpson : a commoner and builder , twenty two boy guards , fifteen Setting A tropical island . At the back , an opening through a thicket leads to the principal town . Forward on the stage is a palm-thatched summer house without walls . Under its roof is a rustic table and bench ; on the table some worn books . On the floor at one side of the stage is apiece of glass , fringed with moss ; this represents a spring . Gulliver , forty-six , drags himself forward in the last stages of hunger and exhaustion . He sees the spring and avidly laps at it with hand and tongue . Somewhat refreshed , he lies down and closes his eyes . Then , rising to a sitting position , he becomes aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens one of the books . In great amazement he murmurs : " English ! In English ! " In the distance a young woman 's voice is heard lilting a kind of yodel . It cases and is resumed several times . Gulliver makes a shell of his hand and calls : Gulliver : Anyone ? ... Is anyone there ? Belinda 's voice : What ? ... Wha ... a ... t ? Gulliver : Is anyone there ? Voice ( nearer ) : " Oo are you ? Gulliver ( still calling ) : I am an Englishman , madam , shipwrecked on this island . Voice : " Oo ? ... " Ooh ? Gulliver : I am Captain Gulliver , at your service , madam . Voice : " Ooh ? <p> Gulliver . Captain Gulliver-Lemuel Gulliver of the fourmaster Arcturus , Port of London , at your service madam . Voice : Oh ! Lord ! " Ow old are you ? ( Gulliver , nonplussed does not answer . ) " Ow old are you ? Gulliver : I 'm forty-six years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! ! Forty-six ! " Ow did you get here ? Gullvier : I was shipwrecked , madam . I have been in the sea for three days , pushing a spar . I am sorely in need of food and am much dependent on your kindness . ( Enter Mistress Belinda Jenkins , eighteen . She gazes at Gulliver with growing abhorrence , covers her face with her hands and turns to the entrance through which she came . ) Belinda : Oh , Lady Sibyl ! " Ow " ideous ! " Ow unbearable ! ( Enter Lady Sibyl Ponsonby , twenty-four . Both are charmingly dressed , as of the eighteenth century , in some textile-like tapa cloth . Lady Sibyl is a great lady , however and carries a parasol tufted with seagull feathers . ) Lady Sibyl ( staring at Gulliver , but with more controlled repulsion ; as though to herself : It 's hall true ! Then it 's hall true , wot they say ! ( pronounced " si " ) Belinda ( to Gulliver , spitefully ) : Turn your fice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Sibyl ( with authority ) : " Old your tongue , Jenkins . Belinda ( pointing ) : But he 's terrible ! He 's terrible ! Lady Sibyl ( coldly ) : Yes. - You are " ideous to behold . Gulliver : I 'm a plain man , madam ; and in addition I have been without food and drink for three days-and with very little sleep . Lady Slb Sil ( again as though to herself ) : I have never seen an old man before . Forty-six , you say ? It 's hall true , too true . Belinda ( peeking from behind Lady Sibyl ) : The wrinkles , your ladyship . Nobody could count them ! - Can he see ? Can he hear ? Lady Sill ( from curiosity , not kindness ) : You must be suffering in every part of your body ? Gulliver : I have suffered , madam , principally from thirst , until I found this spring here ; and I would be most beholden to you if you could also graciously give me something to eat . Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , indeed , a most pitiable spectacle . Gulliver ( with dignity ) : I shall turn my face away if it distresses you , madam . Belinda : All of you is as repulsive as your face . Gulliver : I am as God made me and the hardships I have endured. - If you would graciously provide me with the means I could catch fish to assuage my hunger . I have been shipwrecked before and have sustained myself in many ways Lady Sibyl ( musing ) : At your age everything must to be painful-exceedingly , breathing ... and walking .. . Gulliver ( loud ) : Young woman , are you indeed deaf ( prounced dee ; ) , or do you lack humanity ? I am starving . Belinda : " Young woman ! " You are talking to Lady Sibyl Ponsonby . Lady Sibyl : Be quiet , Jenkins. - Old man , you will be given something to eat . There have been other old men on this island . They were given something to eat before they departed . Gulliver : I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be long . Gulliver : Did I understand you , madam , did I hear correctly : that you have never seen a man of forty-six before ? Belinda : Forty-six ! No one has ever seen anyone older than twenty-nine-except one that floated up from the sea , like yourself . There is no one on this island older than twenty-nine and there never will be . Gulliver : Merciful heavens ! What do you do with vour older persons ? Mistress Belinda Jenkins <p> Lady Sibly : I will now go and call someone to attend your needs . You will not follow me ! You will not leave this place . Today is a day of festival and it is of the highest importance that no one sees you-that is , as few as possible see you. - Jenkins , stay near him . Belinda : I , your ladyship ! ! Lady Sibly : Do not enter into conversation with him . ( appraising him coldly ) I do not think he could progress far . Belinda ( becoming hysterical ) : Oh , your ladyship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become ill with the sight . ( She falls on her knees , clinging to Lady Sibyl . ) I will become ill . Lady Sibly : Get up , Jenkins ! - Very well , I will stay with this man . Go to the Duke of Cornwall . Draw him aside and speak to him in a low voice . Tell him that we have come upon this . . . foreigner . " E will know what to do . Gulliver ( gesturing as though bringing food to his mouth ) : And tell him Lady Sibyl : Tell him the old man is hungry - But , Jenkins , hold your tongue . Do not speak of it to anyone else . Belinda : To think that this should happen today-of all days ! ( She sidles up to Gulliver and examines him intently . Softly . ) Think of all the years he has lived ! Lady Sibyl : Jenkins ! Belinda : Yes , milady ; but I shall never see an old man again . I want to look at him ... ( lower ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One gets used to him , a little. - Old man , have you wives .. . and children ? Lady Sibyl : Belinda ! I shall have you jailed ! Belinda ( turning to her , with spirit ) : Your ladyship , with all due respect to your ladyship , your ladyship has been extremely severe with me for many weeks . I care not if I go to jail . As I was the first person to see this old man I ask to be permitted to have a few words with him . Lady Sibyl : Two minutes , Belinda . .. No more . ( She turns her back on them and moves to the rear of the scene , striking her parasol on the floor ) Gulliver : Yes , Mistress Jenkins , I have a wife Mary , a son John , and a daughter , Betsy . Belinda ( slowly , scarcely a question ) : And are you very cruel to them ? Gulliver : Madam ? Belinda : Old men are cruel and nasty tempered . Everyone knows that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , slowly shaking his head . She continues , as if to herself ) Your eyes are different from our eyes . Maybe some old men are a little bit kind . ( Gulliver , as though in friendly complicity , rubs his stomach with one hand and conveys the other to his mouth . ) Yes , I will hurry. -I am going , your ladyship . Lady Sibyl : And remember , no blabbing . ( She looks toward the sun , almost directly overhead . ) The games are about to begin . When you have delivered your message , take your place in silence . Belinda ( curtsies ) : Yes , your ladyship . ( She goes out . Lady Sibyl starts strolling about with great self-possession ) Gulliver : Surely , I did not hear correctly-no older men ? Lady Sibyl : I have no wish to enter into conversation with you . Gulliver ( after a short pause , no longer able to contain himself ) : By God 's body , madam , you can not be of stone ! You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemptible being . I have been received by kings and queens and have been their guest at meat ... I am Captain Lemuel Gulliver . I am not a dog . Lady Sibyl : I have never seen a dog , but I think you must greatly resemble one . Gulliver : Madam , you have seen nothing but one small island . You are not in a position to say that you have seen anything . I am astonished that you have no questions to put to me about the world that surrounds you . Lay Sill ( lofty smile ) : What questions would those be , Captain Gullibo ? Gulliver : Madam , ignorance is a misery , but there is one still greater : a lack of any desire to increase one 's knowledge . Lady Sibyl : But I have learned much from you in this short time . You have come from that world out there . ( She indicates it lightly with her parasol ; her voice turns suddenly vindictive . ) And you have brought its poisons with you . Your visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . They must be as painful for you to bear as for us to behold . However , you will not have to bear them much longer . ( Gulliver gives up trying to understand her He sinks down on the bench by the table . He is about to fall asleep . ) Captain , it is not our custom for a commoner to be seated in the presence of nobility . ( Gulliver uncomprehending , raises his head . ) I see ; you are deaf ( pronounced " deef ' ) . I said : it is not the custom for a commoner to be seated in the presence of nobility . Gulliver ( dragging himself to his feet ; with ironic deference ) : Oh . .. oh . . . your ladyship will forgive me . . . my fatigue . . . and my hunger . Lady Sibyl ( puts her hand into her reticule and brings out some lozenges , which she places on the table ) : While you are waiting , here are some comfits which I have been keeping ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Sibyl ? Lady Sibyl : Our children on this island live in a village of their own . They are well tended . They are happy . That is our custom here . Gulliver ( In astonishment , about to ask a question , he corrects himself , and , bowing , says in a low voice ) : I thank your ladyship . ( He puts two into his mouth ravenously ; then takes one out for decom 's sake . A musical sound , like a rolling chord from many harps , is heard from the city . Gulliver listens in astonishment . ) May I ask your ladyship the source of that music ? Lady Sibyl You forget everything that you are told . Today is a day of great festival . ( She looks at the sun . ) It is beginning with the children 's Morris Dance and Gulliver : Oh , milady , I would greatly wish to see this festival Lady Sibyl : ( slight laugh , " how unthinkable " ) : These will be followed by the Hoop Dance and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment-is the greatest victor in the Hoop Dance that has ever been known . He has won eight garlands . Moreover , he is the only man who has ever kept a kite in the air for an entire day . Gulliver . Ah ! ! He must indeed be remarkable ! ... An entire day ! ... I trust that the duke is of mature years ? Lady Sibyl ( sharply ) : I did not hear you correctly . ( Gulliver does not repeat the question . ) He is naturally of mature years . He is our governor . He is twenty-eight . ( pronounced " ite " ) Gulliver ( stares at her , then with dawning horror ) : Great Heavens , girl ! What do you do with your older persons ? Lady Sibyl : Captain Gullibo , there is no profit in pursuing a conversation on matters you are not capable of understanding . Gulliver ( shouting ) : You kill them . You murder them when they reach the age of twenty-nine ? LadY Sibyl : How dare you address me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you understand customs that are based on wisdom and reason . Gulliver : I dread to hear them ! ( louder ) Are you able to answer me : what do you do to those who reach the age of twentynine ? Lady Sibyl ( slowly , with serene assurance ) : We drink the wine . We sleep . We are placed in a boat . The current carries us away . Gulliver : Thunder ! This is hellish ! Lady Sibyl ( putting a hand delicately on her ear ) : Restrine your senile violence , Captain Gullibo . Gulliver : And you , your ladyship-are you going to drink that wine and go to sleep in that boat ? Lady Sibyl : When I am old-readily , gladly . I have four years to live . That is a very long time . Gulliver : And no one ever rebels ? No one twenty-nine years old ever wishes to live longer ? Lady Sibyl : Captain Gullibo , you prate . You rive . You forget that you are oldvery old . What I have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the word " custom " ? Would any of us wish to be .. . Gulilter ( hand to head ) : Your ladyship must permit me to sit down . ( He does . ) Lady Sibyl ( strolling about and fanning herself ) : It is understandable that the duke is occupied today . ( severely ) Your arrival is most inopportune . Gulliver : That matter was beyond my control , Lady Sibyl . Little did I know that I was arriving on this happy island on the great day of the Hoop Dance . On future occasions I shall arrange it with greater propriety . Lady Sibyl : ( looks at him and raises her eyebrows ) : Future occasions , Captain Gillibo ? At your age , Captain , you can not speak with certainty of future occasions . Gulliver ( returning her , glance ; in a low voice ) : Lady Sibyl , I am thinking of your children . You will never know the joys of seeing them grow into young manhood and womanhood . You will never hold grandchildren on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gullibo . I have read of those things in books . Gulliver : Ah , madam . You have books , I see . Lady Sibyl : We have one hundred and twenty-seven books , Captain . Gulliver ( lowers his head in admiration ; after a pause , suddenly humble and earnest ) : Lady Sibyl , let me throw myself upon your mercy . You are a woman , and women in all times have tempered this rough world with mercy and compassion . I have arrived a stranger and an interloper here ; I do not wish to intrude upon this happy existence . I can see that you have much influence on this island ; graciously exert it on my behalf . I saw that there were boats drawn up along the shore . I am a seaman of experience . When I have been given some food to stay my hunger , be my advocate with this Duke of Cornwall Lady Sibyl : ( purest amazement ) : Where would you go ? Gulliver : ( pointing ) : ... That island or continent .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to do with such matters . Those fishing boats and their sails are fixed to the shore . They are locked with things that only a few nobles can undo . - You forget that you are old-very old . Your life is over . Anyone can see that . ( She turns away . ) Gulliver : I have a wife and children . - You said you have children ? LadY Sibyl : Naturally , I have children . Gulliver : Look in your heart . Enable me to Lady Sibyl : Be silent ! Gulliver ( sinking onto the bench ; to himself in despair ) : Yes ... yes ... Humanity is the last thing that will be learned by man . ( He puts his head on his arms and is about to fall asleep . ) Lady Sibyl ( waking up and dow , loftily ) : You may be certain that nothing will be done here that is not for the wisest and the best . We are enlightened here ; and we are Christians . The strain of music you heard came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contestants in the games . If you were a young man we would be proud to show you how happy our existence is , and how perfect our institutions . This perfection is rendered possible by the fact that we have no- ( Gulliver has fallen asleep ) Gulliver ( mumbling ) : ... steep ... the steep streets ... Reddrift , home ! ... Mary , Polly ! ... Polly , forgive me ... ( He falls silent . Lady Sibyl gazes at him for a moment with repugnance , then draws nearer and scans his face intently-a long gaze . When he stirs and seems about to wake , she moves away and , opening her parasol , strolls off the stage . In deep stupor Gulliver slips off the bench and rolls under the table . Lady Sibyl returns hurriedly ; there is a suggestion of walking backward as though royalty were approaching . Enter the Duke of Cornwall , twenty-eight , very splendid in festival dress . To the early eighteenthcentury costume have been added feathers and colored shells , etc . He is followed bv Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . The Duke gazes fixedly at Gulliver . ) Lady Sibyl : He has fallen into a swound , your grace . Duke : Simpson , throw some water on his face . ( Simpson scoops some water from the mirror pool and throws it on Gulliver 's face . Gulliver recovers consciousness , stirs and cumbrously extricates himself from under the table . Finally , he grasps the situation and , standing erect , confronts the Duke , eye to eye . ) Who are you ? Gulliver : Lemuel Gulliver , your grace , captain of the fourmaster Arcturus , Port of London . Duke : How old are you ? Gulliver : I am in the middle of my years ; I am forty-six . Duke : They tell me you have been three days without food-Simpson , place the food on the table . Eat ! Gulliver : I thank your grace . Commoners do not sit in the presence of the nobility . I shall eat when you have left to take part in the festival . ( pause ) Sir , I have visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several . In all of them , save one , I have been treated with courtesy as a citizen of New England and a subject of our gracious sovereign , Queen Anne . I am indebted to you for this relief from my hunger . I trust that hereafter I may see your cities and learn of your customs . In return I shall gladly tell you of other parts of the world that I have visited ; and above all of the country whose language you speak and from which your ancestors came . Duke ( again a short contemptuous pause ; then with a curtgesture of the hand ) : You are tedious , old man. - Simpson ! Simpson : Yes , your grace ? Duke : Withdraw to a distance . It is not suitable that a commoner hear this nonsense . I shall call you when it is time for you to stand watch over the captain . ( Simpson bows and , goes out . Gulliver begins to laugh to himself and , turning away , sits down . ) Lady Sibyl ( revolted ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet ask no questions about the country from which your ancestors came ! To be young , and yet have no curiosity concerning the shore that lies upon the horizon ! To be young , and yet-oh , ye immortal Gods ! - to be without adventure of mind or generosity of spirit ! Now it is clear to me why you so gladly bring your lives to a close at the age of twentynine-gladly was Lady Sibyl 's word . Duke ( bitingly ) : That should not be difficult for you to understand-you , with this decay of mind and body Gulliver ( interrupting ) : No ! No , it is not the advance of age that frightens you on this island . ( with a sardonic smile ) A greater enemy threatens you . ( abruptly changing the subject ) I do not wish to detain your grace from the festival and from your trophies . Duke : Come , Lady Sibyl . Gulliver : Permit me , however , one question . ( The Duke nods . ) What is the name of this island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it have a name ? Gulliver : I have visited twenty countries . Each has borne a name in which it takes pride . Duke : Proud ? All of them were proud ? Gulliver : They were . They are . Duke : Among these twenty countries was there one that was not governed by old men-governed , misgoverned , burdened , oppressed by old men ? By the pride and avarice , and the lust for power of old men ? One which did not constantly war at the instigation of old men like yourself , to enlarge the boundaries ; to enslave others ; to enrich itself ? We know of the War of the Roses . Or by the religious bigotry of old men-we know of the Saint Bartholomew Massacre , the murder of Charles , king and martyr . And when these prides of yours have obtained their lands , whose bodies are those lying upon the field of battle ? - They are the bodies of men under thirty . We need no name to distinguish this country from others . Say that you are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gulliver : So be it ! - Since you do not wish me to encumber you longer , I request some boat with which I may rid you of my presence . ( in amazement ) How did you come here ? Who brought you here ? Duke : God ! Gulliver : God ! - Where did you acquire this distrust and hatred of the old ? Duke : We have no boats for that purpose . Gulliver : The smallest would serve me . Duke : No boat of ours has ever made that journey and never will . Gulliver : Perhaps your grace will let me purchase a boat . This ring was given to me by the King of Laputa . It is of pure alchemist 's gold . Duke : You have been here a few hours . Lady Sibyl has told me that already you have offered us insult and have spoken of our customs with contempt ; and now you wish to introduce barter and trafficking , and gold ! - gold , which is above all the instrument by which old men keep the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . You shall never leave this island and you shall not long envenom it . We shall make you a present for which we ask no return . We shall give you the only happiness that still lies open to you . Gulliver : Duke of Cornwall-Duke of Palm Trees and Sand ! I wish you a happy twenty-ninth birthday . I can understand that you will gladly drink the wine and welcome the long sleep . Twenty-nine years of jumping through hoops and flying kites will have been enough . Already you are advancing toward a decay worse than age-yes , toward boredom , infinite boredom . Youth left to itself is a cork upon waves . As we say of the young : they do not know what to do with themselves . It is only under the severity-the well wishing severity-of your elders that you can shake from yourselves the misery of your aimless state . You elect yourselves into societies and call yourselves dukes and earls ; did I hear correctly that each man on this island has several wives ? You play games . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep slumber ! Lady Sibyl ( able ) : Your grace ! How can you let him speak to you so ? ! Duke ( with a smile ) : But this is what we knew ; foul and embittered age ! Envy and jealousy ! Despising those things of which he is no longer capable . ( whimsically to Lady Sibyl ) Perhaps we should take this man and exhibit him for all to see . Lady Sibyl ( coveting her face ) : Your grace ! Gulliver : Yes , and for all to hear , your grace . Duke : And to hear . - What would you say to them ? Lemuel Gulliver <p> Gulliver : Why , I should tell them that if a man is not civilized bv his elders-he will never be civilized at all . ( Lady Sibyl covers her ears . ) And oh , it is not an easy task . To educate young men is like rolling boulders up to the tops of the mountains ; the whole community is engaged in the work and with what doubtful success ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who roll to the bottom of the mountain and occupy themselves with jumping through hoops . ( He sways from weakness , his hand to his head and heart . ) Go to your dances and garlands . I can see that your happiness has begun to stale already . You are weary of life . Old age has marked you already . Duke ( with supreme complaisance ) : Oh , I 'm young enough ! ( He calls . ) Mr. Simpson ! Mr. Simpson ! ! ( The sound of music has been rising8 from the distance . Enter Simpson . ) Simpson : Yes , your grace ? Duke : Simpson , you are in charge of this man . See that he does not leave this clearing . Do not enter into conversation with him . Later I shall send someone to replace you-Lady Sibyl ! Lady Sibyl ( Her hand has gone to her forehead ; her parasol and reticule fall . She is about to faint . ) : Oh , your grace . . . this sight ... has sickened me . Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With a , gesture he orders Simpson to pick up the fallen objects . Simpson does so and holds them ready for Lady Sibyl . ) Lady Sibyl ( swaying ; with eyes closed ) : I must breathe a moment . Duke : Fool ! ( He strikes her sharply on both cheeks . ) Go to the citv ! Gulliver ( taking two steps forward ) : You strike her ! ! You strike her ! Duke : We permit no weakness here-neither ours nor yours . Gulliver ( turns and seats himself on the bench by the table ) : Humanity is the last thing that will be learned by man ; it will not be learned from the young . ( Lady Sibyl has taken her parasol and reticule . She collects her dignity , but is scarcely able to leave the stage . ) Duke : Simpson ! Simpson : Your grice ! Duke : : If you fail at any point in your guard over this man , you will be put to the press-and you know what press I mean . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He looks appraisingly at Gulliver . ) If he tries to leave the clearing , kick him strongly at the shinbones . ( He , goes out . Simpson takes his stand at a distance from Gulliver whom he watches intently . Gulliver returns to his meal , but seems to have lost his appetite . Again there is a sound of music from the city . Gulliver rises and listens . ) Gulliver : Is there no way , Mr. Simpson that I may view the games from a distance ? ( Simpson shakes his head . ) I am sorry . ( He eats a little . ) They must be a wonderful sight ... wonderful . Hoops and kites. ( pause ) You strike women . . . is that often , Mr. Simpson ? . .. Do you strike women frequently , Mr. Simpson ? ( no reply ) . . . You are very proud of your civilization . .. when you are angry you strike and you torture ... ( Simpson mutters something . ) I did not hear what you said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tortures because " e is old . " E will die next year . GIl v1r : He will be killed next year . This is not quite the same thing as merely dying . He will be killed . No wonder he is excitable , Mr. Simpson . In the normal way of life we grow of a more mild and kindly disposition with the years . ( He eats . ) So you are a builder and constructor , Mr. Simpson . You are an architect . Lady Sibyl spoke of a Westminster Abbey . I would like to see it . Did you build this Westminster Abbey , sir ? ( no answer ) You have great storms in this part of the world-far greater than London has . You must build very-solidly . Have you rock here ? ( Simpson points off Gulliver rises and peers in the direction . ) Coral limestone , I presume . Not easy . Arches and a vaulted roof . Ah , you should see the dome of St. Paul 's . There 's a sight , Mr. Simpson ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no disposition to talk , sir . I was afraid that you might ask me questions about the life led by young men like yourself in my country . ( pause ) It would fill me with shame to describe it to you . ( He lowers his voice as though imparting a discreditable secret . ) Imagine it ! You would be working all the time to acquire more knowledge : from morning to nightand at night by lamplight . Think : to be a better doctor , to govern the people more wisely , to be a better builder , Mr. Simpson . Go down on your knees , sir , and thank your Maker that you live on this happy island where learning never penetrates , where young men are not encouraged by old men to extend their knowledge and their skill . Simpson ( loudly ) : The old men drive them like slaves ; the old men take the credit and the profit . Gulliver : The young men succeed them . They are not killed at twenty-nine . They become master builders themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I do not wish to talk about it . I reproach myself that I am preventing you from taking part in the games . Simpson : Commoners do not take part in the games . Gulliver Ah ! ( He eats . Simpson gazes at him , brooding . ) Simpson : I 'm a builder . Gulliver ( looking at the summer house ) : Ah ! - You made this ? Simpson : Aye-and the new Westminster Abbey Gulliver Westminster Abbey ! Then you are the chief builder . Simpson : The chief builder is an earl . He has no time to build . Gulliver : The new Abbey is of stone-of sandstone or coral ? Simpson : The pillars at the corners are . Gulliver : And the roof ? ( Simpson shakes his head . Gulliver points to the thatch . ) Of thatch ? - of palm boughs ? ( Simpson nods . ) But , man , you have severe storms here . Ah ! ( He looks up . ) Mr. Simpson , the storm that cast me on your shores has damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster Abbey able to sustain the fury of that wind and rain ? ( Simpson stares straight before him . ) You will not answer me , man ! Your Abbey seats-what ? - four hundred . Of what is your roof ? Of palm fronds ? ( Simpson , without moving his eyes , nods . ) I see ! When storm destroys your Westminster Abbey you will build another . I see ! I see ! You do n't know how to make an arch or a buttress . Oh , Mr. Simpson , do not ask me the secrets of the arch , the buttress , and the dome . You are happy . Remain happy . Do not let us think of all the labor that went into those discoveries . Simpson ( taking steps toward Gulliver ; in a low voice ) : Sir ... Mr. Captain ... ( His hands describe an arch . ) Do you know how to pile stone . .. so they will not fall ? Gulliver : Believe me , Mr. Simpson , I did not arrive in this paradise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson : But you do know ? Gulliver : Perhaps in a hundred years some unhappy youth will be born with talent-with genius . He will light upon the laws of the arch . He will prove that youth stands in no need of its elders , no need of the accumulated wisdom of its ancestors . He will make a roof ... Bring your ear nearer , young man : the dome of St. Paul 's ... ( His hand describes a high dome . ) Simpson : How high is it ? Gulliver : How high ? Sixty men standing on one another 's shoulders could not touch the top of it . Simpson ( back three yards ) : You are lying ! All old men lie . Eat your food . Go to sleep . I ask you a question and you give me a lie . Gulliver : What I said is true , but your rebuke is justified . There is no greater unkindness than to arouse ambition in a young man. - But you are to blame . You asked me a question . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll be proposing that we take a boat and cross to that shore . No I 'll not go , I tell you . Simpson ( sullenly ) : The boats are tied and we can not untie them . Gulliver : Yes , those thongs the nobles keep . . . ( His eyes are looking off speculatively . ) Simpson : They 're twisted and untwisted with hooks of iron . Gulliver : Iron ? SimpsOn : Aye , they 're the only pieces of metal on the island . The nobles keep them . Gulliver Very wise ! Some fool might think of journeying out there . . . for knowledge and science . - Understand , young man , I 'll not leave this island . Give me this day here ; then bring the wine and the long sleep . Why should a man trouble his head raising domes ? Fly kites , jump through hoops , beget children and sleep . Simpson ( after a pause , grumbling unintelligibly ) : These things you call secrets ... Gulliver : I do not understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets of the arch and the ... batless-old men keep these secrets to themselves , that 's certain . Gulliver ( sternly ) : Cease , Mr. Simpson , to talk of things you know nothing about . Simpson : How would a young man learn them ? Gulliver . You are asking dangerous questions , Mr. Simpson. - Let me bid you again to go down on your knees and thank your maker that you do not live in a country where older men would urge you and struggle with you and encourage you to enrich yourself with all learning and skill . Simpson : I do n't believe you . Gulliver A young man would learn them by crossing that water and finding his own way into a world that does not spend all its time in games and dances . Simpson ( mumbles ) : I do not believe you . ( suddenly loud ) All old men are wicked . Gulliver ( simply ) : I am the only old man you have ever seen . Simpson ( approaching Gulliver the beginning of violence ) : Then tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the batless . Gulliver ( backing away ) : I do not know them . Simpson ( seizing Gulliver 's throat ) : Tell me them ! Wicked old man , tell me them ! Gulliver ( forced to his knees ) : I am not a builder . I am a doctor and a seaman .

( Enter Belinda carrying a tray and more fruit . She starts back in consternation . ) Belinda ( whispering ) : Is he dead ? ... Have you killed him ? Simpson ( sullenly ) : No ... he has died of his old age . Belinda ( puts her ear to Gulliver 's mouth ) : I think he is still breathing . It is a swound .

Simpson , let him go back to his own people . Simpson ( harshly ) : How could he do that ? ( Belinda slowly draws from her apron pocket a hook of iron . Simpson draws back in horror ) Belinda ( low her voice ) : This is the hook that was lost last year . It was on Lady Sibyl 's dressing table . I think she put it there for me to find it . I think she has hidden it to spite the Duke of Cornwall . ( She holds it out toward Simpson . ) Unlock the boat and let the man go . Simpson : No ! Belinda ( gazes at Gulliver Pause .

He would be your friend-I think some old people are good . Simpson : No , I will not go . Belinda : He is waking up . Go away and think ; but take the hook . ( Simpson takes the hook and , goes off ) Gulliver ( opens his eyes . Pause . Sees Belinda . ) : Oh ! You are here ... Where is the young man ? Belinda : He is nearby ... Will you tell me your name again ? Gulliver Captain Gulliver . Belinda : Captain Gulliver . If you first came to your home again what would you do first ? Gulliver : Mistress Jenkins , I would go up the steep street-you have never seen a steep street ! -I think it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. My wife or one of my children would come to the door .. .

Gulliver : Do not husband and wives Belinda : No ! ! ( she laughs ) Sit down ! No man has ever eaten with a woman ! The men eat all by themselves . The nobles in one place . The commoners in another . And the boys when they are six by themselves . Gulliver : And if I lived on this happy island , when would I see my daughter ? ( She does not answer . ) You remember your father ? Belinda : Yes . Gulliver : You saw him often ? You loved him ? Belinda : But ... men live . ... over there ...

( Gulliver clasps Belinda by her shoulders , sadly ) You all die here just before a new world of mind and heart is open to you . ( The music and sounds of celebration have increased , as if approaching . Simpson breaks from his hiding place and rushes to Gulliver with the iron hook . Simpson pulls at Gulliver 's arm and points toward the sea . Gulliver grasps the situation immediately , starts togo with Simpson , but looks back at Belinda .

Footnote Editors note Footnote Born in Wisconsin in 1897 , Thornton Wilder began his career as a novelist , whose most important book , The Bridge of San Luis Rey , won the Pulitzer Prize in 1938 . But it was in the theater , which Wilder believed " carries the art of narration to a higher power than any novel or epic poem , " that he made an indelible mark on American culture . In works like the Pulitzer Prize-winning Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth , Wilder revolutionized the American theater by blending realism with fantasy , and by allowing his characters to speak directly to the audience . The play that appears here was one of a series of seven Wilder never completed that were intended to dramatize the seven ages of man . Wilder died in 1975 . He remains one of the most performed and important playwrights of the 20th century . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
