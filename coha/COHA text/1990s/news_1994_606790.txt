The Dionne quintuplets , one reporter said , were " the greatest sob story any newspaper person ever covered . " And that was written in the days when the money was pouring in and the tale had not yet turned tragic . <p> " We were just morsels to sell , " Cecile Dionne says today . " Money ruled everything .

Thousands of people must still remember making the long drive , from as far away as Texas and California , over the unpaved roads up to Quintland , a government-run complex eight hours north of Toronto , where the girls could be observed in their playground up to four times a day through screened windows in a tall fence . <p> Women would cry and men hush their voices as nurses brought the children out to the swing set and the sandbox . The girls were charming , bubbly and energetic , their hair carefully combed and curled , their clothing clean and new . This being the Great Depression , when children across the continent were going hungry and wearing patched clothes , people must have marveled .

The parents who fought for custody said that . So did the country doctor who brought them into the world and nursed them to health when everyone thought they would die  --  and then made a fortune from his fame . So did the government that took them away from their parents when they were only a few weeks old , raised them in a sterile , custom-built hospital where they were cared for by an ever-changing battery of nurses , and placed them on public view on schedule every day as if they were animals in a zoo . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Bernard Zukerman , producer of " Million Dollar Babies , " a miniseries on the quints ' early years that airs tonight and Tuesday on both CBS and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp . <p> Cecile Dionne , granting her third press interview in some 30 years , does not put it quite that way . But the mere fact she is speaking out reveals the intensity of her feelings . At the end of this interview , she will return to the bungalow in a Montreal suburb she shares with her two surviving sisters and disappear again into private life . For now , she would like the world to know that much was taken from the Dionne quintuplets  --  their childhood , their family , their money  --  and she wants something back . <p> " I was angry and revolted , but no longer , " she says . " Now I want vindication . " <p> The story of the Dionne quintuplets has long been known , but it was seen differently in the 1930s and 1940s , when " scientific " upbringing was considered more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , when the world was desperate for good news . <p> Only now , with the miniseries and the recent comments of the surviving quints , who turned 60 this year and are writing a book , is it becoming clear what was done to Annette , Cecile , Emilie , Marie and Yvonne Dionne . <p> The Moneymakers <p> Because of fertility drugs and improvements in care for premature infants , there are an estimated 27 living sets of quintuplets in the United States . None , however , are like the Dionnes . All , including those conceived without the assistance of fertility drugs , were formed from multiple eggs . Thus no other set of quints is identical , and most are mixed-sex . <p> The Dionnes were formed from a single egg that divided once , then the two divided again , then one of those eggs divided again . They are the only known surviving identical quints in the history of the world . <p> Their survival seems even more improbable given the time and place of their birth : May 28 , 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in northern Ontario . Their parents were poor , Catholic and French-speaking , all of which was crucial in determining the quints ' fate . Ontario , unlike neighboring Quebec , was governed by English Canadians , who viewed the French-speaking population as backward and ill-educated . Allan Roy Dafoe , the doctor who assisted at the birth , certainly felt that way : After 25 years of practicing in the region , he still had learned no French . <p> Dafoe established control from the beginning . It was he who decreed that the premature babies , who weighed a total of 13 pounds 6 ounces , must lie bundled tightly in a basket by the open door of the warm oven , to keep their temperature up . That probably saved their lives . They were fed from an eyedropper and , fearing infection , Dafoe ordered that no one , not even their mother , could touch the tiny infants . <p> Oliva Dionne , the quints ' father , clashed with the doctor almost immediately . Dafoe would say later that Dionne did n't understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dionne , the 25-year-old mother , was too shy to speak the little English she knew . She had five older children and was in no position to counteract Dafoe , or to head off the media assault that began as word got out about the miracle birth in the wilds of Canada . <p> In just a few days , the front yard was crowded with reporters , newsreel photographers , promoters and curiosity-seekers . Dafoe barred the door to protect the babies . But representatives of the Chicago World 's Fair managed to find Oliva Dionne and persuaded him to agree to send the quints to be exhibited , for a weekly salary and 23 percent of the profits . Not even the parish priest was immune to the mercenary forces that would govern the quints ' lives : His church was promised a cut of 7 percent . He urged Dionne to sign the deal . <p> Understandably worried about supporting his 10 children , Oliva Dionne nonetheless changed his mind , sending back the contract and the check 24 hours after he received them . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcry , the government of the Province of Ontario , under Premier Mitchell Hepburn , seized control of the infants on July 27 , on the grounds that the Dionnes had shown themselves to be unfit parents . The babies were placed under the control of a board of guardians . Dionne signed the guardianship papers , though he later said he had been pressured into doing so . <p> Few people spoke against the move . On the contrary , the public and the press hailed Hepburn as having saved the miraculous infants from an ignorant , unscrupulous father . Dionne was portrayed as a buffoon by newspapers and newsreels ; letters poured into Dafoe 's mailbox urging that Dionne be sterilized . <p> Before the quints were a year old , the government of Ontario had extended its guardianship over them until they reached the age of 18 . The ostensible idea was to ensure that they received a fair share of the wealth from their trust fund . Even before they could walk , the quints were generating enormous amounts of money through product endorsements and photo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the guardianship also kept them firmly in place in their specially constructed hospital-nursery , where an estimated 3 million people traveled to see them in the nine years they lived there . <p> For North America in the late 1930s , facing a savage depression and a looming war , the quints were one of the few pieces of good news , and people relished them . In 1936 , the year the quints turned 2 , they were a bigger tourist draw than Niagara Falls . In that year 's Christmas season , sets of quint dolls had bigger sales than Shirley Temple dolls . Describing the souvenir shops , tourist camps , restaurants , pony rides and golf courses that were on the other side of the wire fence from their sheltered hospital , the quints wrote in their 1965 autobiography , " We Were Five " : " It was Coney Island , a World 's Fair and Madison Square Garden rolled into one , so we gather , and we were the sole exhibit .

But every day he and his wife saw others making money from their little girls , and they intensified their efforts to win back the children . Aided by a lawyer , they induced the Ontario government to agree that the girls ' nurses and teachers must all speak French , thereby raising a barrier between the staff and Dafoe . <p> By the time the quints were 7 , a new wave of sympathy for the Dionne parents was developing in the press , particularly in French-language newspapers . Dafoe was terminally ill , and even before that , wrote historian Pierre Berton in his book " The Dionne Years , " he and the other guardians were losing their hero status amid disclosures that the quints ' huge trust fund supported the doctor , the hospital and the nursing staff , to the tune of one-third of the $ 180,000 or so the girls brought in every year . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toddlers . They were growing up , and the flow of tourist cars north to Quintland had slowed to a trickle . <p> On Nov. 17 , 1943 , the quints , their seven siblings ( two more had arrived since the girls ' birth , and another was yet to come ) and their parents moved into a 10-bedroom house built with quintuplet money . The family was reunited ; the new house became , the quints wrote later , " the saddest home we ever knew . " <p> One Big Unhappy Family <p> The miniseries ends with the family 's reunification . But from that point on , the quints ' lives were even more compelling , if more appalling . <p> The girls were " transferred into the Big House as a conquered army might be , " they said in the 1965 autobiography , written with James Brough . " The last thing we wanted to have to do was leave the nursery . It was a haven for us , not a prison .

Instead , she assigned all the housework to the children . It was a common practice of the times , but the quints  --  who by their own admission had been raised like princesses  --  said they were made to do nearly all the work , from scrubbing toilets to shearing sheep to cooking for the farmhands , while the other children were required to do very little . Their siblings may not have seen it that way . Therese Dionne Callahan , five years older than her famous sisters , said in this week 's Maclean 's magazine that the other children " were raised to live a normal life . " Across the street at the hospital , she added , " there were five nurses and five children . " <p> No one contends those were happy days . The quints said their older brothers made fun of them and told them the family would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quints wrote , " competed to see who could treat us more strictly . " The girls received little praise and much criticism , and were not allowed to leave the grounds or make friends with other children . " We were drenched with a sense of having sinned from the hour of our birth , " they wrote . <p> To modern child-development experts , it is hard to imagine a more damaging way to bring up children . Leslie Atkinson , senior psychiatrist for Toronto 's Family Court Clinic , calls it " horrendous . " <p> Multiple caretakers can cause young children not to trust anyone , not to become attached  --  except , perhaps , to each other , he says . A transfer into an unfamiliar family , where the girls were forced to demonstrate affection for people they had been taught were a threat , would only confuse things further . <p> " To me , the quints seem to have had everything stacked against them , " Atkinson said .

Emilie died following an epileptic seizure in 1954 , when she was 20 , at a convent where she was studying to be a nun . Marie , who had confronted troubles with alcohol and depression , died in 1970 , of a blood clot in her brain . All three marriages ended in divorce . <p> Cecile Dionne resents the implication , in Berton 's book and elsewhere , that it was the quints ' bizarre upbringing that contributed to their unsuccessful marriages . At the same time , she acknowledges that damage was done . She has been in therapy for years , and she says that has taken the edge off her pain . <p> To her , all the squabbles arose from five factors : money , religion , language , politics and family . But she does not see it in terms of villains and heroes : " There were people who were more broad-minded and mature , others were more malicious , in quotation marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't do better . " <p> She displays disgust , however , over the issue of money . In 1941 , the quints ' trust fund was worth more than $ 900,000 . It paid for everything , from the more than $ 270,000 it cost to build the hospital complex to birthday presents for the quints every year . <p> It is not clear where all the money went . Emilie died without knowing about the trust fund . The surviving sisters drew on the fund as they got older , and Berton writes that the husbands spent a good bit of it . Nearly all of it is now gone . The three sisters , none of whom is working , survive on " a little income , " Cecile says , and Yvonne has a pension from the library where she worked , but they are worried about retirement . It is for that reason , Cecile says , that she is now speaking out . <p> The sisters are considering a legal action against the government of Ontario , and perhaps against Canada 's federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs . They have negotiated a share of the profits from the Dionne Quints Museum in North Bay and from sales of souvenirs at the Dionne Quint Collectors convention , which meets every five years . They are attempting to negotiate with the newsreel companies that filmed them so often , and they received a payment from the makers of the miniseries . Their new autobiography , titled " The Dionne Quints : Family Secrets " and written with Quebec novelist Jean-Yves Soucy , is scheduled for publication in French next spring . <p> The sisters  --  they have been living together since Yvonne joined Cecile and Annette a year ago following hip surgery  --  still receive an average of 80 letters a week . <p> " It 's very secure " living together , Cecile says , though the sisters have n't decided whether to do so indefinitely . They live " a normal life , " sharing laundry , cooking and cleaning duties . There seems little question that the three provide one another with some of the support they did not get from family or three rotating shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cecile says .
