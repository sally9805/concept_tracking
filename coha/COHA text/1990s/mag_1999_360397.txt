The announcement in February 1997 of the birth of a sheep named Dolly , an exact genetic replica of its mother , sparked a worldwide debate over the moral and medical implications of cloning . Several U.S. states and European countries have banned the cloning of human beings , yet South Korean scientists claimed last month that they had already taken the first step . In the following essay for TIME , embryologist Wilmut , who led the team that brought Dolly to life at Scotland 's Roslin Institute , explains why he believes the debate over cloning people has largely missed the point . <P> Overlooked in the arguments about the morality of artificially reproducing life is the fact that , at present , cloning is a very inefficient procedure . The incidence of death among fetuses and offspring produced by cloning is much higher than it is through natural reproduction  --  roughly 10 times as high as normal before birth and three times as high after birth in our studies at Roslin . Distressing enough for those working with animals , these failure rates surely render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Even if the technique were perfected , however , we must ask ourselves what practical value whole-being cloning might have . What exactly would be the difference between a " cloned " baby and a child born naturally  --  and why would we want one ? <P> The cloned child would be a genetically identical twin of the original , and thus physically very similar  --  far more similar than a natural parent and child . Human personality , however , emerges from both the effects of the genes we inherit ( nature ) and environmental factors ( nurture ) . The two clones would develop distinct personalities , just as twins develop unique identities . And because the copy would often be born in a different family , cloned twins would be less alike in personality than natural identical twins . <P> Why " copy " people in the first place ? Couples unable to have children might choose to have a copy of one of them rather than accept the intrusion of genes from a donor . My wife and I have two children of our own and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider what might have happened in my own marriage if a copy of me had been made to overcome infertility . My wife and I met in high school . How would she react to a physical copy of the young man she fell in love with ? How would any of us find living with ourselves ? Surely the older clone  --  I , in this case  --  would believe that he understood how the copy should behave and so be even more likely than the average father to impose expectations upon his child . Above all , how would a teenager cope with looking at me , a balding , aging man , and seeing the physical future ahead of him ? <P> Each of us can imagine hypothetical families created by the introduction of a cloned child  --  a copy of one partner in a homosexual relationship or of a single parent , for example . What is missing in all this is consideration of what 's in the interests of the cloned child . Because there is no form of infertility that could be overcome only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My concerns are not on religious grounds or on the basis of a perceived intrinsic ethical principle . Rather , my judgment is that it would be difficult for families created in this way to provide an appropriate environment for the child .
