##@x <p> SUSPICIONS about a deal between the Reagan campaign and Iran over the hostages have circulated since the day of President Reagan 's inaugural , when Iran agreed to release the 52 American hostages exactly five minutes after Mr. Reagan took the oath of office . Later , as it became known that arms started to flow to Iran via Israel only a few days after the inauguration , suspicions deepened that a secret arms-for-hostages deal had been concluded . <p> Five years later , when the Iran-contra affair revealed what seemed to be a similar swap of hostages for arms delivered through Israel , questions were revived about the 1980 election . In a nice , ironic twist , the phrase " October surprise , " which Vice Presidential candidate George Bush had coined to warn of possible political manipulation of the hostages by Jimmy Carter , began to be applied to the suspected secret activities of the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign . <p> I was a member of the Carter Administration and on the staff of the National Security Council from August 1976 to April 1981 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rumors in 1981 and I dismissed them as fanciful . I again heard them during the 1988 election campaign , and I again refused to believe them . I had worked in and around the Middle East long enough to be skeptical of the conspiracy theories that abound in the region . <p> Then two years ago , I began collecting documentation for a book on the Reagan Administration 's policies toward Iran . That effort grew into a massive computerized data base , the equivalent of many thousands of pages . As I sifted through this mass of material , I began to recognize a curious pattern in the events surrounding the 1980 election . Increasingly , I began to focus on that period , and interviewed a wide range of sources . I benefited greatly from the help of many interested , talented investigative journalists . <p> In the course of hundreds of interviews , in the U.S. , Europe and the Middle East , I have been told repeatedly that individuals associated with the Reagan-Bush campaign of 1980 met secretly with Iranian officials to delay the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this favor , Iran was rewarded with a substantial supply of arms from Israel . <p> Some of the sources interviewed by me or my colleagues are or were government officials who claimed to have knowledge of these events by virtue of their official duties or their access to intelligence reports . Most insisted on anonymity . <p> Other sources are low-level intelligence operatives and arms dealers who are no boy scouts . A number of them have been arrested or have served prison time for gun-running , fraud , counterfeiting or drugs . Some may be seeking publicity or revenge , but others have nothing to gain from talking about these events , and genuinely feared for their personal safety . Several sources said they were participants , personally involved in or present at the events they described . <p> Their accounts were not identical , but on the central facts they were remarkably consistent , surprisingly so in view of the range of nationalities , backgrounds and perspectives of the sources . Because of my past Government experience , I knew about certain events that could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories confirmed those facts . It was the absence of contradictions on the key elements of the story that encouraged me to continue probing . This weight of testimony has overcome my initital doubts . <p> The story is tangled and murky , and it may never be fully unraveled . At this point , however , the outlines of what I learned can be summarized as follows : <p> In December 1979 and January 1980 , Cyrus and Jamshid Hashemi , two brothers who had good contacts in Iranian revolutionary circles , approached the Carter Administration seeking support for their candidate in the Iranian presidential elections . I met both of them briefly during that period . Although Washington was sympathetic , their appeal was overtaken by events . Their candidate lost , but they remained in contact with the U.S. Government , providing useful information about developments in the hostage crisis . <p> Cyrus died in 1986 , only three months after his cooperation with the U.S. Customs Service in a dramatic sting operation that resulted in the arrest of several Americans , Israelis and Europeans on charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also involved in international arms sales , was not implicated in that affair . I re-established contact with Mr. Hashemi in March 1990 and interviewed him a number of times . <p> According to Mr. Hashemi , William Casey , who had just become Ronald Reagan 's campaign manager , met with him in late February or early March 1980 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington . Mr. Casey quickly made it clear that he wanted to prevent Jimmy Carter from gaining any political advantage from the hostage crisis . The Hashemis agreed to cooperate with Mr. Casey without the knowledge of the Carter Administration . <p> Mr. Hashemi told me that he and his brother helped to arrange two critical meetings . In a Madrid hotel in late July 1980 , an important Iranian cleric , Mehdi Karrubi , who is now the speaker of the Iranian Parliament , allegedly met with Mr. Casey and a U.S. intelligence officer who was operating outside authority . The same group met again several weeks later . Mr. Hashemi told me that Mr. Karrubi agreed in the second Madrid meeting to cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In return , he was promised that the Reagan Administration , once in office , would return Iran 's frozen assets and help them acquire badly needed military equipment and spare parts . Two other sources subsequently described these meetings in very similar terms in interviews with me and my colleagues . The Carter Administration had no knowledge of these meetings . <p> At about the time of the second meeting in Madrid , according to two former Israeli intelligence officers I interviewed , individuals associated with the Reagan campaign made contact with senior Government officials in Israel , which agreed to act as the channel for the arms deliveries to Iran that Mr. Casey had promised . Israel had been eager to sell military equipment to Iran , but the Carter Administration , which was maintaining a total arms embargo on Iran , had refused to agree . <p> As the threat of war with Iraq began to mount in early September 1980 , Iran opened direct hostage negotiations with the Carter Administration . In retrospect , it appears that Iran may have been playing both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Carter Administration , however , did not realize it was involved in a three-cornered bidding contest , and resisted Iran 's apparent interest in military equipment . <p> The Iraqi invasion of Iran on Sept. 22 , 1980 , added both urgency and confusion to the various negotiating tracks . Two former Reagan campaign aides told me that this generated new fears within the Reagan-Bush campaign that war pressures would lead Iran to release the hostages before Election Day , thereby improving President Carter 's chances . <p> Adding to the complexity , the Carter Administration secretly had been developing plans for a possible second hostage rescue mission , after the failure of its earlier mission , Desert I , in April . It became operational in September 1980 . Richard V. Allen , Ronald Reagan 's first national security adviser and a member of his campaign , told me that one member of the rescue team contacted him and gave him a description of the second rescue plan . Shortly thereafter , the Reagan-Bush campaign launched of the hostages prior to the election . <p> From Oct. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of meetings in several hotels in Paris , involving members of the Reagan-Bush campaign and high-level Iranian and Israeli representatives . Accounts of these meetings and the exact number of participants vary considerably among the more than 15 sources who claim direct or indirect knowledge of some aspect of them . There is , however , widespread agreement on three points : William Casey was a key participant ; the Iranian representatives agreed that the hostages would not be released prior to the Presidential election on Nov. 4 ; in return , Israel would serve as a conduit for arms and spare parts to Iran . <p> At least five of the sources who say they were in Paris in connection with these meetings insist that George Bush was present for at least one meeting . Three of the sources say that they saw him there . In the absence of further information , I have not made up my mind about this allegation . <p> Immediately after the Paris meetings , things began to happen . On Oct. 21 , Iran publicly shifted its position in the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving military equipment . From my position at the N.S.C. , I learned that Cyrus Hashemi and another Iranian arms dealer secretly had reported to State Department officials that Iran had decided to hold the hostages until after the elections . <p> BETWEEN Oct. 21 and Oct. 23 , Israel sent a planeload of F-4 fighter aircraft tires to Iran in contravention of the U.S. boycott and without informing Washington . Cyrus Hashemi , using his own contacts , began privately organizing military shipments to Iran . On Oct. 22 , the hostages were suddenly dispersed to different locations . And a series of delaying tactics in late October by the Iranian Parliament stymied all attempts by the Carter Administration to act on the hostage question until only hours before Election Day . <p> After the election , the lame-duck Carter Administration resumed hostage negotiations through Algerian intermediaries , but the talks stalled . On Jan. 15 , Iran did an about-face , offering a series of startling concessions that reignited the talks and resulted in a final agreement in the last few hours of Jimmy Carter 's Presidency . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President . <p> Almost immediately thereafter , according to Israeli and American former officials , arms began to flow to Iran in substantial quantities . A former senior official in the Israeli Ministry of Defense told me that the shipments by air and sea involved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment and that detailed lists of each shipment were provided to senior officials in the Reagan Administration . Moshe Arens , the Israeli Ambassador to Washington in 1982 , told The Boston Globe in October 1982 that Israel 's arms shipments to Iran at this time were coordinated with the U.S. Government " at almost the highest of levels . " <p> Former officials and participants in the Reagan-Bush campaign team uniformly have denied any personal knowledge or involvement in such a deal , although none of them categorically denies that contacts with Iran before the 1980 election may have taken place . Richard V. Allen vehemently denies any agreement between the campaign and Iran over the timing of the hostage release . He told me and others , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not vouch for every " independent , freelance , spontaneous , over-the-transom " volunteer . <p> Can this story be believed ? There is no " smoking gun " and I can not prove exactly what happened at each stage . In the absence of hard documentary evidence , the possibility of an elaborate disinformation campaign can not be excluded . <p> But all of that must be balanced against the sheer numbers and diversity of the various sources , from eight countries on four continents . Some 20 individuals , including myself and some of the sources mentioned above , have been interviewed and can be seen tomorrow night on the Public Broadcasting Service 's documentary series " Frontline . " <p> The allegations of these individuals have many disturbing implications for the U.S. political system . One is the tampering with foreign policy for partisan benefit . That has , of course , happened before and it may well happen again , but it assumes special poignancy in this case since it would have involved tampering with the lives and freedom of 52 Americans . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of blackmail by Iran or Israel . Third , the events suggest that the arms-for-hostage deal that in the twillight of the Reagan Presidency became known as the Iran-contra affair , instead of being an aberration , was in fact the re-emergence of a policy that began even before the Reagan-Bush Administration took office . <p> But finally , it implies a willingness to pursue private , high-risk foreign policy adventures out of sight of the electorate . That may be realpolitik . Its practitioners may indeed win big . But it is profoundly antidemocratic . <p> During my research , I spoke to several of the former hostages . I was deeply moved by the response of one in particular . After listening to the evidence , he said simply : " I do n't want to believe it . It 's too painful to think about it . " Painful it is . But the rest of us are obliged to think about it . Hard . @@649958 London , 1815 <p> Stephen Rawlings Mallory , fifth Marquess of Silverton , felt a familiar sense of resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one observing him would have known that he was n't listening attentively to his uncle . Silverton had exquisite manners . He would never commit an act of rudeness unless the recipient of such an act deserved it . <p> " Are you listening to me , Silverton ? " snapped General Stanton . " Have you even heard a word I said ? " <p> " Of course I have , sir . You know how much I value your thoughts on this and any subject you may care to discuss . " <p> " Do n't try to pull the wool over on me , boy . I 'm not your aunt or your mother , and I know you bloody well do n't care what I have to say about you , " his uncle retorted . " You 're nothing but a popinjay who do n't give a damn about what he owes to the title or to his family ! " <p> Silverton 's young cousin , Robert Stanton , had been sitting quietly in the corner , displaying uncommon good sense in keeping his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on his mentor and idol proved to be too much of a provocation for Robert , and Silverton could see he was about to come to his defense . He shook his head slightly , willing Robert to silence , but the young man either failed to see or to understand the small gesture . Silverton sighed inwardly , lamenting the fact that his cousin had neither the wit nor the sense of self-preservation to avoid bringing his grandfather 's wrath upon himself . <p> " No , really , sir , that 's just not fair . Stephen , a popinjay ! " exclaimed Robert . " You must know he is one of the best sportsmen in the country , not to mention having some of the finest horseflesh and hounds in all of England . Really , Grandfather , to compare him to a dandy is just too much ! " <p> The general 's head swiveled around to his grandson , iron gray eyebrows bristling with irritation as he trapped his next victim in his sights . <p> " No , you young jackanapes ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You can barely turn your head in that ridiculous neckwear . You look like a stork peering out of its nest . And all your poetic airs and lamentations ! It is enough to drive me to an early grave . No , you are indeed the dandy in the family , and just as useless when it comes to finding a wife and doing your duty to your name . " <p> Robert turned bright red , sputtering a confused defense that he was still too young to get married . He was easily cowed by his grandfather and particularly sensitive about both his appearance and his literary aspirations . The lad did not actually write any poetry but firmly believed that he only awaited the arrival of his muse to unleash what would undoubtedly be his artistic genius . In the meantime , he read Byron , spent an inordinate amount of time on his clothes , and generally comported himself in a harmless manner with several fashionable young men whose families the Stantons had known forever . <p> Silverton understood , however , that General Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He deemed it time to intercede before the squabble developed into a full-out row . <p> " Now , Robert , " he interjected in a soothing voice . " Uncle would never call me a dandy , and I 'm sure he appreciates my horseflesh as much as the next person . But you ca n't blame him for wishing to see us settled , although I do agree you are a bit young to be pushed into the parson 's trap . " <p> " Not at all , " exclaimed the general . " I was only nineteen and your aunt only seventeen when we tied the knot . I 'm sure she has never had any cause for complaint since that day . " <p> " Perhaps we should ask her , " muttered Robert . <p> The general whipped his gaze back to his grandson . " What was that ? " he growled . <p> Silverton hastily intervened . " Yes , well , be that as it may , God knows it 's not easy to find a woman with Aunt Georgina 's qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky to snag such a prize so early in life . " <p> General Stanton grunted his reply , mollified as always by the thought of his wife . Silverton knew that in spite of the gruff response , his uncle was inordinately fond of Lady Stanton and cherished her in his own inarticulate manner . He also knew his uncle was dismayed that he and Robert did not seem the least bit interested in settling down and starting families of their own . <p> The three men sat in the library of General Stanton 's richly appointed townhouse in Berkeley Square , shortly before noon on a warm April morning . Silverton thought it much too early in the day to endure a dressing-down , but ignoring his uncle 's summons would only have postponed the inevitable . He was , after all , almost thirty-five , and it was indeed high time he took himself a wife . <p> For many years now he had allowed his mother and aunt to drag him to Almack 's , and from one subscription ball to another , in the hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent basis . He had met many charming young ladies and enjoyed several delightful flirtations . But over time his willingness to be pleased had evaporated , replaced by a cynical amusement with the relentless machinations of the marriage mart . <p> The fault lay not with the numerous debutantes thrown his way , who were as trapped by the subtle yet unbending rules of the ton as he was . In fact , in his more generous moments he even felt sympathy for the girls whose parents drove them to hunt him like a prized stag . Mostly , though , he felt irritation and contempt , and not much else . <p> Silverton had come to the conclusion long ago that he was by nature a cold person or , at the very least , lacking in strong feelings . He enjoyed many things-his horses , his dogs , and his friends . He was fond of his mother and adored his Aunt Georgina . But he could never seem to muster any real attraction toward the fluttering girls paraded before him and honestly had no desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-which was n't often-it invariably left a dull , faintly sour taste in his mouth . But Silverton knew it was only a matter of time before he must resign himself to a suitable alliance . Duty required him to marry , and marry he would , but he had no expectations for his own happiness . <p> Silverton listened absently while his uncle berated Robert . Since it did n't really seem to matter whom he married , he had compiled a list of eligible candidates in his head to present to the general for discussion and approval . Now seemed as good a time as any to make the decision . <p> He was about to open his mouth when he heard a commotion out in the hallway and the raised voice of Tolliver , his uncle 's excruciatingly correct butler . The door to the library flew open and Tolliver exclaimed , " No , no , miss . Wait ! You can not go in there ! " <p> All three men turned their heads toward the door and were met with the astonishing sight of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself confronted by their shocked gazes , she stopped in her tracks . Tolliver followed closely behind and only just managed to avoid barreling into her . <p> Silverton rose slowly to his feet . Robert seemed paralyzed , but he finally remembered his manners and sprang to attention . For one long moment , they all remained trapped in a stunned silence before the general finally found his voice . <p> " Who the devil are you ? " <p> The intruder 's eyes quickly surveyed the room , skipping Robert and coming to rest on Silverton . Their gazes locked on each other . He felt as if he had been nailed to the floor , so captivated was he by the sight of the feminine whirlwind who had swept into their midst . <p> A tall , long-limbed creature , her shiny black hair curled out from under a sturdy country bonnet . Although she seemed no more than twenty-one or twenty-two , her self-assurance in confronting a roomful of strangers suggested she could be older . <p> But more than anything , her eyes captured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , determined brows and framed by thick black lashes . It was their color , however , that had caught his attention so forcefully . They were gray , but not the insipid , neutral color one associated with the term . No , they reminded him of a winter rainstorm-turbulent , untamed , and full of secret depths . <p> He stared at her , dimly aware he was probably making an ass of himself , but it seemed impossible to look elsewhere . She , too , seemed unable to break away , her eyes widening as a faint flush bronzed her cheeks and the bridge of her nose . For just a second , he thought the darkness in her gaze transmuted into something lighter , a brief flash of silver in the deep . Silverton could not seem to assemble his thoughts into a coherent order , but it occurred to him that she looked like a young goddess , magnificent and full of righteous anger . <p> Then she blinked , the spell broke , and she turned to face his uncle . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wrung his hands in distress over this astounding breach of etiquette . " I tried to tell this young ... woman that she could not disturb you , but she waited until my back was turned and then ... " <p> He trailed off into silence , too distraught to even finish his sentence . <p> The general impatiently waved his hand at the butler . " Yes , yes , well , you may go , Tolliver . I 'll deal with this situation . " <p> " Yes , sir . " The butler tottered out of the room , clearly shattered by the disturbance to his well-ordered household . <p> General Stanton focused his gaze on the young woman standing before him . <p> " Now , miss , " he said , " perhaps you will be so good as to explain your extraordinary behavior . " <p> Silverton again saw the faint flush color the woman 's pale complexion , but it was apparent by the way she held her ground that the general 's irascible demeanor failed to intimidate her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quiet voice . " My stepmother was your daughter , Elizabeth , and your granddaughter , Annabel , is my half sister . " <p> Another stunned silence fell over the library . If she had shot a cannonball through the room , the shock could not have been any greater . Silverton grimaced , bracing himself for the inevitable explosion as General Stanton confronted the stepdaughter of his bitterly estranged and long-dead child . <p> The old man was , indeed , turning an alarming shade of red as he rose from his chair to contend with this obviously unwelcome spectre from the past . In fact , he appeared on the verge of an apoplectic fit . Silverton cast about for a way to divert his uncle 's attention , but his mind at the moment felt approximately as agile as a snail crawling through two feet of mud . <p> " How ... how dare you enter this house ? " General Stanton finally managed to blurt out . " By God , woman , what right do you have to disturb my peace after your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tradesman 's son to marry my child ! Her mother and I have spent many years trying to forget our loss . And now , after all this time , you dare come here ... to my home ! " <p> The general shook with rage , his hands clenched into white-knuckled fists . " He ruined her life , I tell you , and it broke her mother 's heart ! " <p> For a few seconds , General Stanton glared at the silent young woman before turning his back on her . Miss Burnley staggered under the impact of the old man 's wrath , swaying a bit as if she might faint . Repressing a curse , Silverton moved quietly across the thick Aubusson carpet until he stood behind her . He could think of no other response to his uncle 's shocking outburst , but at least he could catch her if she swooned . <p> Fortunately , Miss Burnley remained on her feet . <p> " I am here , sir , " she replied in an unexpectedly sharp voice , " because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , hoping you would realize how much your granddaughter needed the protection of her family . You chose to ignore us , and she has been forced to submit to the direction and guardianship of a man who does not have her best interests at heart . I have imposed myself only to implore that you intervene on Annabel 's behalf to prevent a most unhappy fate from befalling her . " <p> Miss Burnley struggled to maintain her composure . She clamped her arms tightly against her sides , attempting to subdue the tremors shaking her body . Silverton felt an oddly powerful impulse to take her in his arms and soothe her . He fought the unfamiliar urge as the young woman deliberately straightened her spine and cocked her elegant chin . Instead of retreating , she stepped closer to the desk , leaned into it , and fixed her implacable gaze on his uncle . <p> " General Stanton , I must insist that you listen to me . If you do not , Annabel likely will not survive this threat to her wellbeing . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , hostility etched in every line of his face . <p> " You must help her , " she implored again . A note of faint panic seemed to thread her voice . " I would not have disturbed you if there had been any other way to save Annabel . I can not lose her . She is all I have . " <p> Her voice caught , and she fell silent . Miss Burnley clutched her reticule in a tight fist and turned away from the general as if embarrassed by her loss of control . She gasped when she discovered Silverton standing so closely behind her , taking a hasty step back to regain her balance . <p> Grasping her elbow , he gently steered her to one of the leather club chairs to the side of his uncle 's desk . " Miss Burnley , wo n't you sit down ? You may tell us everything you need to regarding your sister , but I insist you have some refreshment first . " <p> Silverton glanced at his cousin , who was glued to the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert , " he admonished , " do stop catching flies and ring the bell for some tea . " <p> The lad snapped his mouth shut and hurried over to yank vigorously on the bell cord . <p> Silverton returned his gaze to Miss Burnley , who sat bolt upright on the edge of her chair , eyes lowered as she grasped her handkerchief in a death grip . Taking a deep breath to steady herself , she looked up to meet his eyes . <p> " Thank you , sir . I should be most grateful for a cup of tea . " Her soft mouth trembled into a tentative smile . <p> He blinked as the force of that shy smile lanced through him . The unexpected jolt of emotion was both surprising and irritating . <p> General Stanton forcefully cleared his throat , jerking Silverton out of his momentary reverie . After briefly examining Miss Burnley 's pallid complexion , he crossed to a mahogany sideboard holding a collection of decanters and crystal glassware . Silverton poured a small glass of sherry and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the thing , but I fancy you could use something a bit more fortifying while we wait . " <p> " No , I 'm fine , " she protested . " I do n't need that . " She took another deep breath , folding her hands carefully in her lap . <p> " Yes , you do , " he replied in a firm voice , willing her with his eyes to take the drink . " Come , Miss Burnley , I insist . " <p> She looked at him doubtfully . He nodded his encouragement , and she again offered him that painfully sweet and tentative smile . Miss Burnley took the glass and sipped , casting her gaze up as if seeking his approval . Silverton found himself riveted by the luscious tremor of her full pink lips and the burnished silver of her amazing eyes . <p> Under the circumstances , his reaction was obviously most inappropriate . <p> He mentally shook his head at the day 's unexpected turn of events . He had right into the middle of what his mother called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrangement between the general and his daughter . It had always seemed like ancient history to Silverton , especially since Elizabeth Burnley had died so many years ago . But part of that ancient history had come back to life today , and with a vengeance . <p> He looked thoughtfully at the striking young woman perched on the edge of her seat , cautiously drinking her small glass of sherry . In spite of the obvious distress of all the parties in the library , Silverton had to admit this was much more fun than talking about his impending immolation on the matrimonial altar . <p> Especially when one of the parties involved was Miss Meredith Burnley . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
