I The lemon tree splatters a lacy shadow over the hot grass . A main bough gave out five years ago under the weight of fruit the size of croquet balls , which should have been picked but was n't ( there are just so many things you can do with lemons ) . The scar from the missing limb is black with rot , as if a lightning bolt did the surgery . You have to remind yourself of the real story . <p> Nora squints and kneels low at the edge of the bed , working at the base of a dead raspberry with a bending plastic sand shovel . A spot of blood shows through the cap of gauze on her left thumb . <p> The backyard is defined by splintered redwood fences to the north and south and a high , pink cinderblock wall to the west . The east is the O'Clair house , the hidden side of the house they decided to paint last when it looked as if they 'd run out  --  the stucco bleeds right to left from buttercream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only in a certain light . <p> Not in this light : late August just past one and the house glows white , the fuchsias pull away from the wall , look black against its brightness . In the northeast corner the manic mock orange has taken over , swelling out and up with slick dark leaves and inedible fruit . The sprinkler trained to the petrified bed beneath it has no effect : water runs through the matted raspberry bushes , fanning into deltas over the baked lawn . The low rush of the Santa Monica Freeway four blocks east is like a steady breath . <p> No sun seeps through the canopy of the avocado , hanging over the entire west half of the yard . A bamboo swing clings like a chrysalis to a wide branch . The neighbors ' golden retriever roots smashed oily fruit from the carpet of dead leaves until chased off with claps and shouts . She shimmies back through the tunnel under the gate , her muzzle smeared with green paste . <p> Drifts of avocado leaves blanket the garage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sloping roof ; a dirty frisbee , lime green and lip-up , collects rain in other seasons . On the back porch , a fierce pair of corroded hedge clippers , a box of gauze pads , and a roll of adhesive tape . <p> A concrete slab connects the east side of the garage to the back porch of the house . A perfect circle , ten feet in diameter and rust-colored ( left from a portable swimming pool , 1975 ) , is good for Duck Duck Goose , Smear the Queer , or Exploding Enchiladas , but today holds six garbage bags lined up straight  --  two soft and packed like sacks of flour ; four irregular , showing shapes of branches and planks beneath their stretched black skins . <p> Next to the back porch is a plywood doghouse , symmetrical and cartoonish , now a pigeonhole for seedling trays and electric-yellow sand toys . A baby tub , complete with built-in soap dish , became a dog tub , then a short-lived pond for tadpoles , a gauge to measure rainfall . Its swampy contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the roof of the doghouse , brown drips trailing down the eaves . <p> The aluminum roof of the water-heater shed is brilliant , leaving blue sunspots in your eyes like a flashbulb . <p> The heat is too much . Just outside the shadow of the lemon tree , May flips from her stomach to her back , adjusting her bikini top over established tan lines . She presses a finger on her thigh to check for burn and turns to Nora . " Do n't dig up any dead pets , Mom , " she says , and wipes the sweat from beneath her sunglasses . <p> II They said they 'd be home but they 're not ; Jayne knocks and knocks , tries the busted doorbell ( still busted ) , knocks again and takes a swipe with the bakery bag at a drooping camellia bush . A tired blossom gives out and drops to the flagstone walk . What 's the matter with them ? They knew she was coming over , that she was bringing pictures of the house in Lone Pine . Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect house for the three of them . Away from this old place ( ferocious yellow ; aging , sickly yellow ) . Ca n't they imagine it ? The broken Sierras , the smooth Alabama Hills , the space , the space and silence . Her mother dipping a wooden spoon in a kettle of gooseberries , pulling threads through a loom they could set up in the fourth bedroom ; May beneath the grape arbor with a paperback , hiking with the dogs to the mailbox on Whitney Road . Why ca n't they see the luck in this ? If Jayne had n't driven two hundred and fifty miles up 395 , if she had n't stopped for gas in Lone Pine but had gone ahead to Independence or Bishop , she never would have seen the neatly stenciled sign : For Sale  --  Our Home . And anybody could see , following the map down along Tuttle Creek , out past Paiute and Whitney Road , anybody could see it was a home , not just a house . Jayne had dug her nails in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road near the leaning mailbox , cried at the pillowcases on the clothesline , the scrolled metal flowers on the screen door , the three lawn chairs set up in the dust under a cottonwood ( a sign  --  it could n't be ignored ) . Every piece of it was more familiar than anything here  --  more real , Jayne feels , than this squat pine mailbox , the weeds between the flagstones , the brass cap embedded in cement that marks the property line . She had only wanted to put distance between herself and Jeffrey , to drive out the evil spirit by running over hot coals ( Death Valley in August , a VW squareback without air conditioning ) . It was satisfying to realize that there had been a destination all along . For Sale  --  Our Home . <p> Jayne walks up the oil-blotted driveway to the back , resolved to break in . There 's a very old system involving the removal of glass plates from the shutters on the back door and a painful reach down through the aluminum frame to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mother gave her a necklace once in junior high , a chain of silver balls from the hardware store with a brass key for the dead bolt . She hid it next to her skin , under her T-shirt or snap-up P.E . blouse . There was a blue stain on her stomach that year , the product of a chemical reaction : sweat and metal . She hid that key because it was a terrible secret , for some reason . That her mother would n't be home to let her in , maybe , or that her mother could n't trust Jayne to keep it in her pocket . And just recently Jeffrey , the same impulse : the gold key for the studio apartment crammed with his ex-wife 's furniture , a chain bought at a hardware store . Jeffrey at the counter scratching his new beard , placing his order ( standard lengths or by the inch ? ) , brushing the grains of filings off the fresh key , imagining the width of her neck so he could get the right length , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't broken in the house since junior high but she 'll do it today . They 're trying to avoid the question here . She even brought muffins . <p> The back gate wo n't open until she remembers : one foot in the trench beneath the slats , hike the gate up an inch , and the latch clacks open . They discovered this before they were old enough to reach over but it 's still the best way to do it . Even her mother picked it up , but for a different reason  --  to manage the latch with armfuls of groceries , children , sacks of lemons and avocados to take next door . <p> Jayne scoots around the old doghouse to the back porch but there they are : Mom hunched over and attacking the ground with a pink shovel , May decked out in a black bikini top and denim shorts  --  cut from a pair of jeans Jayne wore years ago . Those buggy sunglasses . She looks very arranged there . The French Riviera . Jayne 's glad she wore her new sundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern )  --  it 's pretty flattering . <p> " What 's going on here ? " Jayne asks . She has n't seen her mother work in the garden for years or maybe never . They 're supposed to be looking at the pictures , deciding about the Lone Pine house  --  over Earl Grey , Jayne had imagined . She brought muffins  --  poppyseed and pumpkin . Next to her mother 's thigh a pile of found objects : chunks of brick , half a cracked plastic Easter egg , the lid of toy sugar bowl with black and yellow daisies . <p> May continues to stare at the sky . " We 're working , " she says . Her skin is very dark . " Mom wants a real garden , finally . " With a black plant mister , May showers her thin legs : three quick squirts . <p> " A white garden , " Nora says . Her shovel flicks a spray of peasized dirt clods . <p> " A white what ? " Jayne asks . <p> " A white garden , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galaxy by Night . This is what American Greenthumb says in the August issue . " May chews on her lower lip . " Is n't that right , Mom ? " <p> Her mother uses both hands , the shovel scrapes at the ground . " Right , " she says . <p> " I 'll believe it when I see it , " Jayne says . Another horrible thing about this place  --  it 's a gallery of derailed projects , of good intentions : the vegetables planted and ignored each spring ( some dead , some totally out of hand ) ; the naked trellis built to hide the water-heater shed , the creeping mandeville preferring to choke a rake or wind up the throat of the spigot ; the solar panels leaning hopefully against the wall of the garage , waiting for the shift in gravity that will carry them to the roof , where they can be useful . " And do n't dig up Frodo or anything , Mom , " Jayne says . Did n't they bury her around there ? How deep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . That old kerchief hiding her silver hair . " What is it with my kids ? " she asks . " I know the burial sites of every cat , dog , and parakeet in this whole garden . " She rerolls a sleeve of her housedress back up to her shoulder . Her arms ( the part of her mother that has never changed , Jayne thinks , has never aged ) are thick and freckled . Nora leans into the bed again , working with heavy stokes . " Forest Lawn , " she says dryly . " Twenty-six baby mice , too , underneath the fuchsia . What a holocaust . " <p> Jayne draws the bag of muffins closer to her body . She remembered , of course , that the mice had died , but that many ? Was it that many ? " I did n't think it was twenty-six , " Jayne says . <p> " The whole litter , " Nora says . " They were left in the unfinished bathroom . " She yanks at a root with her bandaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The windows were shut ; it was July , " she says , explaining the carelessness to the lump of dirt turned off her shovel . <p> The unfinished bathroom : exposed studs and pink fiberglass insulation that made you scratch . It could n't have been a lack of money that kept that room skeletal for twenty years . After Dad moved out there was no more enthusiasm for the project ; Jayne always assumed that the idea of completion was somehow deeply offensive to her mother  --  finishing something her dad had started . Jayne remembers scratching the splinters of fiberglass in her fingertips , finding her mother sitting in the gritty bathtub with a box of Kleenex sometime after Clark died . But the mouse cage  --  Jayne tries to see the cage ( on a stack of drywall ? scattered newspapers ? ) but ca n't . She knows about the mice only through stories . <p> " I do n't believe it , " May says . She squirts her midriff with the plant mister and rubs the water in . <p> " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> May stretches  --  her fingers laced together and turned palm out over her head , her legs lifting straight like chopsticks . " Family folklore , " she says , and yawns . <p> Jayne kicks off her flip-flops and stands in May 's sun . " Crap , " Jayne says . " How would you know , anyway ? I do n't even think you were around yet . " <p> May takes off her sunglasses and raises herself on her elbows . " How is it that all the babies died  --  twenty-six , according to Mom  --  but the parent mice survived ? " <p> Jayne turns to her mother , waiting for the answer . <p> " They were stronger , " Nora says over her shoulder . " No mystery in that . And do I have any reason to lie to you , Mavis ? " <p> " Not a lie , " May says . She reaches out to the hem of her sister 's dress and rubs the fabric between her thumb and forefinger . " Pretty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth either , " she continues . " I 've been looking at that frisbee all day and thinking what a sham it is . " <p> Jayne does n't have to look up . The frisbee on the garage roof . " Clark 's frisbee ? " Jayne asks , and is instantly embarrassed  --  the shame of the obvious , the shame of letting your voice crack over something so old . <p> May grabs the wadded T-shirt she 's been using as a pillow and yanks it on . When she stands , Jayne is surprised at her height , always expecting May to come up to her waist , to want to be carried . <p> " That 's exactly what I mean , " May says . " Clark 's frisbee . You 're always giving me that line that Clark threw that up there ; that he got it stuck . " <p> " He did , " Jayne says . She can still picture it : trying to avoid the lemon tree , he hooked it ; it flew up over Jayne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tried to get it down by throwing tennis balls but some of those got stuck , too . They gave in and ate cold hot dogs from the refrigerator on the back porch . <p> May picks a snail from the base of the lemon tree . " You mean , " she says , " it 's been up there for twenty years ? I find that hard to believe . " She drops the snail over the north redwood fence , into the neighbors ' yard . " Very romantic , " she says . <p> " Believe what you want , " Jayne says , but wonders what to believe herself . She was there , throwing tennis balls  --  it was tennis balls ?  --  and she remembers Clark 's dirty feet against the bottom step of the porch . But twenty years . Would n't it have slipped off in that time ? Become buried in avocado leaves ? " It does n't matter , anyway , " Jayne says , handing her sister a pumpkin muffin from the sack , resting one on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house has a garden and a peach orchard , " she says , sitting down cross-legged in the grass . " Can you imagine it ? Peach pies from scratch . " <p> III When you 're so high up ( to a snail , May guesses , she must be Godzilla ) , it 's easy to smash a field of them : they come out on the sidewalks when it rains . Was it just for the sensation ( the shattering of the shell like blown glass , the slippery body smeared into concrete ) ? Was it a test of bravery ( an Indian rain dance , thick-soled school shoes stomping , eyes fixed on the horizon ) or a ritual for measuring one 's capacity for cruelty ( deftly sliding over a plank of grass , the spiral cave perfectly suspended ) ? <p> Under the vines of the tomato bush , there are at least ten . May 's close enough to watch the thick antennae test each leaf . She 's never noticed the patterns : radiating spokes of purple and brown , as complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratty stores on the Santa Monica pier . So different from the escargot she steams with shallot butter for clients , for brunches and appetizers . The city version : stunted , resistant to poisons . L.A. snails , French snails , cousins of sea snails , cousins that do n't keep in touch . The thought that they are somehow connected , that there are snails in the Pacific , in other countries , in other people 's backyards , makes the rain dance memory more difficult . It could n't have been her ( thick-soled school shoes ) . It must have been something she witnessed but did n't participate in  --  a book , a movie , a story . <p> This whole plan of Jayne 's is like fiction , too . The three of them in the high desert : Jayne thinks they 'll grow beards and turn into Amish men . Or women  --  linen caps tied at the chin , spindle-backed rockers and quilting bees . May has too much going in L.A. to participate in one of Jayne 's morality plays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but about the Strawbridge Theater , the contract to cater their opening parties ) . How could she tell her sister that she loves a man because he 's noisy , because he fills space with noise ( he sings : Five foot two , eyes of blue , dada dada dadada  --  has anybody seen my gal ?  --  I hope not , she 's supposed to be in Tahoe , ha ha ) ? <p> May lifts each snail from beneath the tomato plant ( a small suction off the leaves ) and sets them in an old seedling tray from the doghouse . Some she puts down to face each other , to tap their antennae in shy conversation ; others she lines up against the wall . They test the sheerness of the slope . She could wait for dusk and dump the lot in Mrs. Markovich 's yard . She could pinch one shell , make it pop like a dropped light bulb  --  the light bulb Martin dropped from the cherry picker to the stage . <p> It smashed like a grenade about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very proud that she had n't jumped , only flinched slightly and stayed on her chalk X , the area that had to be focused . " Get the works , " Martin said from the top of the cherry picker , and cursed himself , slapping at a safety chain that connected the light to the suspended electric bar . " Would you mind getting the work lights ? " he repeated . " I ca n't see a thing . " <p> She was grateful for the distraction . Standing in those pools of light while he fiddled with bolts and shutters , he was starting to ask questions , questions about the sex they had in the prop closet . <p> He could n't leave it alone . If they had sex in the prop closet , leaning up against a wishing well of sponge rock or sitting in the throne of the King of Denmark , he could never leave the incident there , but had to discuss it later , away from the confined space . So when he asked her if she liked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , when he held her arms behind her back , she never knew how to respond , as if that person ( her bra bunched up above her breasts , her necklace swung around to her back , where it would n't hang in his face ) , that femme was someone she knew only in passing ( you could pick her out of a lineup ; she rode the same bus with you every day and wore the same damn hat ; but you 'd never talk to her , not even to tell her she 's forgotten something important ) . Martin was wonderful , was wonderful with sweat in his hair , was very yak yak yak , and sang Five foot two , and was nosy about nothing but this . So she evaded , asking him questions about the show . Was Antigone beautiful ? Had they found a boy to guide Tireseas ? How exactly had they worked the director 's bizarre request : that Tireseas must appear and disappear mystically ? Martin let her change the subject for a while , had explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be unlocked  --  menacing smile , sweat on the rims of his ears  --  ha ha ha . <p> " He has to disappear with smoke , if you can believe it , " Martin said , peeling a bit of gaffer 's tape off the bottom of his shoe and tossing it down to the stage . " I said , ' He 's a prophet , a sage , Dan . He 's not Houdini , Dan . Read the play . " ' <p> " I 'm watching my step , " she said , poking the stage with a pointed toe . " I do n't want to get sucked into the Underworld . " <p> Now fifteen snails in the seedling box , freakish little bumper cars . Not to be irresponsible , she adds a salad of grass and muffin and dandelion heads . " Peach pah from scratch , " she says , affecting a Southern drawl her sister did n't use . She wonders if the snails like their new home or if they can even tell the difference : crusted dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray and inescapable sunlight . <p> May knew enough to find the switch for the work lights , behind a tiny cage near the manager 's desk stage left . The grate 's big enough to slip fingers through and pull the thick switch down with a fat clack . The stage was flooded by six pan lamps hanging from the grid . <p> After a minute he said , " Okay , let 's forget this one . " She watched his boots and the wrench that swung from a rope tied to his belt loop . <p> " Do you know why I love you ? " she asked . <p> " I did n't know you loved me . " <p> " Okay , " she admitted . " Let 's pretend I do . Do you know why ? " " Why oh why oh why , Gwendolyn dear ? " he said . " Can you bring up thirty-six B ? " <p> " Because I do n't worry about you following me home . " She killed the works and followed the same procedure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the dimmer on the board and walked to the corresponding numbered chalk mark on the stage , stood and let Martin train the pink-gelled circle of light around her ( they did n't pick up the shattered glass under her feet , the exposed filament lost on the black stage ) . <p> He started up again : " Do you want to try a new place ? " The circle shuddered around her as he tightened the focus . " Like the booth ? The orchestra pit ? " <p> She squinted into the light . " Is Antigone still whining her monologues ? " <p> He scowled . " What do you care ? " <p> " I care , " she said . " I 'm interested . " <p> " Like hell . " She could hear him open the gate at the top of the cherry picker . The ladder swayed with his first step down . " I bet you do n't even know what the play 's about , " he said . He grasped the sides of the ladder with his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the last six rungs . His blond hair spiked <p> wet ( the lamps  --  one thousand , two thousand watts  --  like standing in the sun ) , two gel frames rattling around his wrist like <p> bangles . " So what 's it about ? " A swipe of dust across his forehead and his gloves tucked in his jeans . <p> " Antigone 's brother , " May said , moving off her chalk mark , out of the light , downstage toward the empty house . " He 's killed and she wants to bury him . She wants to free his soul . " <p> He sat on the edge of the stage and softly kicked the wall of the orchestra pit with the heel of his boot . " I 'm impressed . " Up his forearms slivers of brown moons  --  burns from running the trooperette spots . He waved a motion that meant Come and sit with me . She pretended not to see , looking out toward the glowing green sign in the back of the balcony : EXIT . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What was his name again ? " More perverse questions . <p> " Polynices , " she said . As close as he would get . <p> " Ha , ha , " he said . " How did he die ? " <p> May returned to the circle of light and clasped her hands to her heart . " He was a cruel traitor . " <p> IV Nora curled up in the bamboo swing beneath the avocado tree ; she can be still , still , but the swing sways on its long rope , a tiny repeated motion that makes her nauseous . She anchors herself with the toe of her sneaker to the ground . <p> Jayne 's disappeared behind the garage and May 's collecting snails on her hands and knees . Strange that of the two , May seems so much more grown-up ; but this could be because she 's never known May as well . <p> On her lap , a folded envelope and photographs of a house she 's never seen : a thin cat in a sharp triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ancient pickup , both the same shade of dusty green . She holds each picture with her fingertips ; her hands are very dirty . And Jayne wants Nora to be with her , to scoop up that cat and give it a flea dip , take in the shirts and <p> sheets , drive an American car down an unpaved road and leave all this undone . Work for ten lifetimes in this yard : the trees , never properly pruned , hopelessly out of scale . And it ca n't be fixed  --  you ca n't just prune them all now because they 've grown that way . Everything grows so randomly , without a thought for the foundation of the house , the shingles of the house ripped off by extending branches . Nora makes a mental list of the tools they 'll need  --  a saw , a new pair of hedge clippers , a lawn edger , a new box of garbage bags  --  but forgets it , watching the sun spark off May 's silver necklace as she pokes through the seedling tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , refolding the envelope on her lap , not knowing what she means exactly . <p> The white garden could be finished , though . She could get that done . May was off on her own , really , now ; the new contract with the theater in Venice . Jayne had this new man  --  what was his name ? - Jeffrey , and as soon as she got the Lone Pine house out of her system . . . well , there was time now . Nora could get it done . <p> She lifts herself from the swing . The white sand path would be here , she suddenly decides , a thin strip from the dark tree to the back porch , interrupted by a silent fountain . A Showplace by Day  --  A Galaxy at Night . White blossoms and white buds and trees with white bark ; white sand paths combed and glowing . The stone fountain where the lemon tree is now  --  wide and shallow for the birds , a silent column of water melting into the pool . Nora <p> imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical jaws down to bite a tree from the earth , scooping up the dry shells of baby mice , dropping the mess on the Markovich side of the property line . <p> Nora pushes back the garage door . The cool sawdusty dankness of the room makes her want to open the only window , stuck shut for twenty years and tinted with sticky yellow dirt . On the east wall her ax-husband set up steel shelves for tools , hung pegboard and labeled spaces : PHILLIPS , FLATHEAD , ALLEN , CRESCENT , SOCKET ; PIPE , MONKEY , TAP , CLAW , SPOKE SHAVE , and BALLPEEN ; JIG , BAND , COPING , VICE . Empty baby-food jars still hold a few nails : BOX ; TEN-PENNY , FOURTEEN-PENNY , TWENTYPENNY ; FINISH . The tools were what he cleaned out when he left . <p> The paint cans , some gallon-sized , some as small as your fist , are piled together on the worktable ( two sawhorses and the back wall of a dented aluminum gingerbread house ) . Their rims are dotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Buttercream . And then what she 's looking for : clean cans of Candlelight White . It is n't exactly right , she thinks , bending back the stiff bristles of a brush left in a jar long after the water evaporated ; it 's not pure white . She feels an obligation , though , because there 's so much of it ( two gallons of flat and a pint of gloss ) . What they had pictured when they imagined the new bathroom : ferns and black ceramic tile and Candlelight White . <p> A table knife from an ancient pattern is there on the table , obviously used to pry open cans in the absence of a slotted screwdriver . Nora jams the knife around the ridge , forcing the old lid off . With half a broken yardstick she stirs the honey oil slick into the pigment . <p> The blast of sunlight brings back some of the swing nausea , or is it the smell of paint ? She dips her brush in the can and makes an X on the trunk of the lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mom ? " she says . The tone is : Do you need to sit down ? Get out of the sun ? <p> " Mavis ? " Nora says , dragging a wet brush over the tips of leaves on the mock orange , marking it for demolition . <p> May is suddenly behind her , hands stuffed in the pockets of her shorts and cocking her head as if she 's missed the joke . " What 's going on , Mom ? " <p> Nora bends and runs the brush along the grass , defining the path she planned before . White sand , fine as sugar . The blades bend down with the heavy coat . Nora smiles and clicks her teeth together in a little rhythm , dousing the bristles again and holding <p> the wet brush to the bamboo swing . She stops . <p> " What are you doing Mom ? " May 's voice falters , she looks around quickly for her sister  --  a witness for the competency hearings . <p> " I used to hold you in my lap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very small . " She sets the can down in crunching leaves . <p> " I 've heard this one , " May says . " When I was ' football , ' right ? " <p> " Right , right , " Nora says , distracted . " Before your dad hung it up in the tree , Jayne and Clark played with it on the lawn . They turned it open side down to the ground , like it was a cage . Jayne was always the Viet Cong and Clark the American soldier or something . I had to rescue him a lot . " Nora reaches over and X 's the woven bamboo spokes with two quick slashes . <p> " What does X mean ? " May asks . " That we 're getting rid of it ? " <p> " X means it 's history , " Nora says , and scrapes a bit of paint off the inside of her wrist . <p> V The ivy is four-feet deep and chokes the thin gap between the cinderblock wall and the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your feet against the other , inching your way up to the roof , digging your dirty fingers into your shaking legs  --  the best view of the neighbors ' yards . Jayne ca n't step into that ivy . It 's the same fear she has at the beach : not of the waves or the currents or even drowning ; it 's the fear of what she ca n't see under the surface , earthworms and earwigs , pulltops and broken glass . Her pale feet in plastic flip-flops , the garbage bag her mother gave her flapping empty against her leg . Jeffrey tells his son , Carson , to be brave ( last week , brave was crossing the driveway on his tiny rollerblades ) . Jeffrey says if Carson is brave they can have his favorite for lunch  --  Top Ramen mixed with tomato soup ( sometimes with a square of American cheese ) . Carson , swathed in fluorescent-orange protective gear ( helmet ; elbow and knee pads ; wrist guards ) , poised at the top of the long driveway at Jeffrey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Jayne if she was pretty or not , then asked if she was a girlfriend . Jayne told him to ask his father . He said it was his mother who wanted to know . <p> Jayne leans against the back wall and presses her feet into the garage  --  can it still be done ? She ca n't lock her knees like she used to , her legs are too long , and the cinderblock is much rougher than she remembers . But there , she can do it ( she pulls her dress between her knees , hiding her underwear ) , she can hold herself above all the buggies . Jeffrey always tells Jayne that she 's strong  --  again and again , as if to convince himself . <p> Carson at Venice Beach . Jayne thought it would be a great idea  --  Carson breaking in his new rollerblades on the bike path , a picnic lunch ( homemade bread and fresh strawberries ) , away from phones and elliptic messages on the answering machine . Once , while Jayne and Jeffrey read Carson 's Spidey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine pick it up , " Jeffrey said ) , asking Jeffrey 's blood type  --  just in case . In case of what ? They could n't figure it out . At the beach they spread out an old quilt and dabbed zinc on each other 's noses . With that common facial feature they could be mistaken for family . <p> Carson liked the babes . He announced this in such a way ( triumphantly , while eating a tuna sandwich ) that Jayne thought he may have borrowed the term from his father  --  something Jeffrey would never say in front of her but may say in private , in society with his son . Carson said he would marry the girl with the longest , longest hair , and pointed to a teenage girl jumping with the Hare Krishnas . The girl 's hair was braided in a rope that swung and spasmed with each jump . <p> Jeffrey had told Jayne to be brave , that the official divorce would take some time . Carson in his rollerblades clung to Jeffrey 's neck at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided to grow longer , assessing this new feature of his father 's face . Jayne had inventories , too , but only after Jeffrey was asleep , in the dark . Counting the fingers in a sleepy fist . <p> Jayne inches up a bit . The stem of her flip-flops cuts between her toes . The cinderblock scratches pink burns into her palms . <p> " What will it be like married ? " Jayne asked Carson , now busy with a straw and a box of grape juice . <p> " We 'll have a church , see ? " he said confidently , jabbing the box with the sharp end of the straw . " This church , see ? And I 'll marry with Mommy , with Dad , with ladies with long hair , ladies with dresses , see ? " <p> " Sounds sort of crowded , " Jayne said . She was glad Jeffrey was gone finding a skate rental . He would overanalyze this . <p> " And then , " Carson said , sighing with feigned exhaustion , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chop-chopped her arm . <p> " A good skill , " Jayne said . " Could definitely come in handy . Do you think I could live in Japan with you , Carson ? " <p> He chopped again , this time adding a squealing grunt and a kick into Jayne 's thigh . <p> " Carson , " she repeated , " do you think I could live in Japan , too ? To do karate ? " <p> He said , Pow , and Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat like a machine gun , hammering into her arm with tiny fists . She grabbed his wrists . <p> " Be gentle ! " she said . " You have to be more gentle . " He struggled with her and called to his father , who was weaving his way through islands of beach blankets , still out of earshot . <p> Carson bent down and licked Jayne 's hand  --  an old trick . Jayne let go and wiped her hand against the sandy blanket . <p> " You ca n't come , " Carson said , " because this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Carson jumped to his feet in a new karate pose one leg bent up like a crane , his arms outstretched for balance . " You wo n't be around by then , " he said , and threw out a fist at his invisible enemy . <p> VI Nothing after six matches , then a dry leaf catches and curls , brown smoke weaving through the dense pile of sticks and branches . There 's no reason to burn any of this , May knows . A six-pack , and the garbage men will take anything : an old beanbag chair that smells like cat piss , rolls of apple-green shag pulled up from the bedrooms , an entire bough of the lemon tree once that they d8id n't even bother to cut up , fruit scraping and bouncing against the driveway as they dragged it out . One piece of wisdom passed down from her mother : a six-pack ( not domestic , do n't be insulting ) balanced atop the offending item , and it will vanish . Regardless of weight or mass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be burned on the bald patch of grass near the water heater . She crouches in front of the smouldering , tossing pinches of lemon leaves and poinsettia twigs . Fresh fuchsia blossoms into the sharp-smelling smoke  --  they 're too irresistible ( that purple cup and pink tails always makes a ballerina , stamen legs and pinpoint-yellow shoes ) . They 're thrown in as a sacrifice ; as a distraction ; because she picked a handful and hammocked them in her T-shirt ; because she 's tired of looking at them ( she picked them in a sentimental rush after talking to her mother , after looking at the photographs Jayne brought of the Lone Pine house ) . <p> When she was eight , May ran away . She set up a damp backpacking tent in the backyard and started a fire : charcoal and grass clippings and lumber scraps from the garage in an old hibachi . Jayne was sitting that weekend , had watched the whole production from the living-room window with a glass of iced tea , wearing enormous headphones attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hear . It was n't until May dug out a can of lighter fluid that she saw Jayne at the back porch . Her feet were bare and her toenails painted white  --  a surprise . <p> " Building a fire , huh ? " Jayne had said . She wore an oversized Yes sweatshirt with the collar cut out and a baggy pair of jeans . She did n't look like May 's friends ' sisters . Her bra strap was showing on her shoulder , and May 's face burned , though there was no one in the backyard to be embarrassed for . <p> " It 's a bonfire , " May corrected , squeezing the closed aluminum can , listening to the cool metal pops . <p> " Bon fire , " Jayne said . " A good fire then  --  that 's French . It seems to be going pretty well without the explosives , kiddo . " <p> May put the can down in the grass and poked her fire with a stick . " Bon fire , " May said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm gon na cook eggs in it tomorrow . " She meant  --  I 'm staying out here all night ; you can&gt;t make me go back . <p> The back door closed and Jayne was gone . The house was darker now and May could n't see if she was at the window anymore . May believed in ghosts and used an Ouija board to talk to Clark . " Do you watch us all the time ? " she asked , resting her fingertips lightly on the plastic disk . He said , Yes Yes Yes . <p> The fire went out that night ; the tent and blankets wet with her breath . May abandoned camp and snuck up the back steps , through the door ( unlocked ) . Jayne always slept in the roll-away bed in May 's room when she came over , and May did n't want to risk waking her . She curled up on the settee in the study , pulling down a red-bound dictionary from the bookshelf above her head . <p> It was n't a good fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't sleep and could n't sleep until she did , waking up to Jayne 's applesauce pancakes . <p> If you watch closely you can see the mass escape : ants and pinchers and pill bugs flee the burning forest , every man for himself . <p> VII The roof creaks beneath Jayne 's bare feet . A shingle slides loose and tumbles through heaps of crackling leaves . She fists her sandals and gathers her skirt , trying to make each step land lighter and lighter . Her mother and her sister down below nurse a pile of smoke with twigs and branches . <p> The frisbee unburied is warm from the sun . She flings it out away from her , and it floats . It floats . <p> <p> ELIZABETH BINGGELI <p>
