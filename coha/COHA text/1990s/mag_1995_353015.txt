TIME journalists , like most of their kind , are used to gathering facts from a variety of sources around the world . But reporting for this special issue on the cyberrevolution has been unusual . In addition to asking many outside experts about the impact of information technology on society , we found ourselves turning inward to tap the many experienced sources within our own company  --  indeed within our own magazine . Not only is Time Warner Inc. , TIME 's parent company , involved in a wide range of multimedia projects  --  such as the creation of a pioneering interactive television system in Orlando , Florida , and the establishment of its own site on the Internet  --  but TIME magazine has introduced its own brand of journalism into these new media forms . <P> For the past 18 months , each weekly issue of Time has been available on the electronic newsstand of America Online , the fastest-growing of the commercial computer services . Since going online , our editors , writers and correspondents have been familiarizing themselves with yet another new journalistic venue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers  --  friend and foe alike . <P> The learning continues . Last fall we inaugurated Time Daily , an electronic news summary posted each weekday evening on AOL and , most recently , on Pathfinder , Time Warner 's new home on the Internet 's World Wide Web . Each week Pathfinder also offers Netsurfers a view of TIME 's weekly contents , as well as a look at many other Time Inc. publications ; it is getting more than 1.5 million hits , ' ' or requests for additional documents or pictures , each week . <P> Our next step is participation in interactive television , which is a natural extension of our online work . TIME journalists will play a major role in providing the content for the News Exchange , a video information-on-demand feature on Time Warner 's Full Service Network in Orlando that will allow viewers to watch the news they want whenever they want it . A number of TIME staff members have already had to don makeup to tell their stories in front of a videocamera . <P> TV , once viewed as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally . In conjunction with this issue , we are co-producing a one-hour program that will air April 5 on the Discovery Channel , covering much of the same material you see in these pages but presented in quite a different manner . The TV documentary , like Time Daily and Pathfinder , is yet another way for us to bring first-rate journalism to as many people as possible  --  something we 've been up to for more than 70 years .
