<p> IN A BURST of candor unprecedented at a movie press conference , novelist Pat Conroy , a new San Francisco resident , recently upstaged Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte when he blithely declared that " The Prince of Tides " " could have been a dreadful movie because there 's something about my writing that 's a little overdone even to me . " <p> The Southern writer , who minced no words describing his own eccentric family in the semiautobiographical novel , had additional doubts when he learned that Streisand would not only direct and produce the film , but would star . She plays Dr. Susan Lowenstein , a New York psychiatrist who helps football coach Tom Wingo ( Nolte ) face the trauma in his family 's life . While tracking his memories to learn the reason behind his twin sister 's suicide attempt , Wingo  --  who 's having career and marital problems  --  falls in love with Dr. Lowenstein . She is married to a sardonic , world-famous violinist and has a teenage son ( Jason Gould ) who 's more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday at the Northpoint Theater . <p> Conroy , who is both forthright and funny , did n't know what would happen to his book on the way to the screen . " Because Barbra as a personality is like Napoleon Bonaparte , " Conroy said he thought the movie would turn out to be dominated by the character of the psychiatrist . " I had no idea that she is a great director and I had no idea about her generosity . The generosity part is that she gave the movie to Nick Nolte . " <p> An Oscar nomination is a surefire bet for the actor 's terrific performance as the angst-ridden Wingo . To say nothing of his freaked-out lawyer in " Cape Fear . " His two magnetic appearances certainly make him the Hollywood man of the year . <p> Conroy said he had started to work on the script with Streisand " in terror because I heard she was mean . I got scared . I did n't want her to yell at me and hurt my feelings , but we worked for two weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " Conroy said . " I lived better than I normally do because I was with her in her Manhattan apartment , and she lives like Marie Antoinette . She has the best furniture I 've ever sat on , the best food I 've ever eaten and , I 'm tellin ' ya , she lives great ! " <p> With a buildup like that , Streisand in person confounded expectations . She looked tiny , elegant and , yes , pretty , in a sleek black outfit with a long split skirt , simple gold belt and two antique gold rings on her fingers . Her voice was soft and modest as she accepted congratulations on the film , and she seemed light years away from the raucous wise-cracking youngster who belted out her songs at the hungry i in the ' 60s and stunned veteran show-biz types with her abrasive chutzpah . <p> However , a sensitivity beyond ambition gleamed in her decision to direct and star in an unlikely film , " Yentl , " based on I.B. Singer 's story about an eastern European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress like a man to enter an all-male yeshiva . " Yentl " not only reflected Streisand battling a male dominated Hollywood , but illuminated her respect for both tradition and nonconformity . <p> Streisand 's grandmother used to call her farbrent , which means " on fire , " because she could n't accept no for answer . " I still ca n't , " she told a writer from Vanity Fair . <p> With only the merest trace of her old New York accent , she said she felt passionate about the theme of forgiveness in Conroy 's book . " It 's real life . We all come from families . We all want to be human beings and get the most out of life . I know that therapy has been helpful in my life . The film deals with the feeling that love has the ability to transform people , and that 's very important to me . I do n't particularly believe in Freudian analysis but I like the theme of coming to terms with your past , accepting what was and being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in denial . " <p> In a breathless stream of consciousness , she continued with what was really on her mind . " I think President Bush was in a state of denial the other day when he said we were n't in a recession . I think the country 's in a bad state . The world 's in a bad state . I think it 's the same thing we 're talking about in the movie . It 's like we 're fooling ourselves ; we 're fooling the world . <p> " In the Jewish tradition , there 's a phrase tikkun olam , which means to repair the world . If we can look back and heal ourselves , we would n't be cut off from feeling . Because if you really feel how could you watch the destruction of the planet and not do anything ? I just hope people will vote for Democrats and put more women in office . " <p> She said she 's declined invitations to the White House and refused an offer to sit at President Bush 's table when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Bush 's secretary asked her to repeat her One Voice concert ( which benefited organizations devoted to the environment , anti-nuclear activities , civil liberties and civil rights ) on the White House lawn in a ceremony honoring General Norman Schwarzkopf . " I thought that was bizarre ! " Streisand said . <p> She was so wound up talking about the environment , pollution and the current " fast-buck mentality " there was n't a chance to ask about the trauma in her own childhood . Her father , a teacher of English literature , died when she was 15 months old . When she was 7 , her mother married a used- car salesman . " I always wanted to get his approval and love , but I could n't no matter what I did , " she told Vanity Fair . She even surprised herself when she cried recalling those days during an interview with Mike Wallace recently on " 60 Minutes . " <p> Now she 's into the pop psychology expounded by John Bradshaw , author of " Homecoming : Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal their " metaphysical blues . " <p> Nolte had plenty of those himself : memories of the fights he had with his father , a World War II veteran , when Nick questioned the morality of the Vietnam War ; his parents ' divorce ; three divorces of his own ; one palimony suit ; and alcoholic binges that finally sent him to Alcoholics Anonymous two years ago . <p> At 50 , he does n't look any the worse for wear , but he confessed , " I do n't understand women entirely . I grew up in a world that required you to be head over heels in love and you get married and slowly there 's a winding down and you wonder where all the mystery has gone . But I 've been very satisfied with my relations even though I have not had the ' ideal ' relationship that lasts for 50 years with one woman . " <p> He said he and Streisand had many long talks about romantic love , but he could n't figure out why she always called " cut " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wingo and Dr. Lowenstein are deliving into their pasts , it almost seems as if Nolte and Streisand are reliving the pain in their own lives . <p> A line in Conroy 's book states : " There are no crimes in a family beyond forgiveness , " but Conroy was quick to contradict himself : " I was lyin ' , " he declared . " The key event in my life was that Dad beat us up , and he used to irritate me claiming it did n't happen . " <p> There 's a scene in the film where the father pushes one of his sons and the boy pushes him back . " My three brothers came up to see the movie , and they just roared at that . The question was : What would have happened if we had pushed Dad back ? One of the boys said , ' We would have been thrown through a plate-glass window . ' " The brothers also were bowled over by Kate Nelligan 's resemblance to their mother , who left their father the day he retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminisced . " She used the expression ' It 's not the Southern way ' to make us do anything she wanted . It was an all-inclusive term to control our lives . My father was a Chicago Irish guy with no style and no class . She simply loathed everything he stood for  --  as well she should have . It 's driven us crazy trying to figure out why she married him . " <p> In fact , Conroy had a nervous breakdown and " wall-to-wall therapists " for many years until he started writing " The Prince of Tides . " The character of Lowenstein was inspired by his Jewish wife from Brooklyn . <p> Unlike " The Great Santini , " a novel based on his father , " Prince " is more about his mother and his sister , a poet like Savannah in the film , who has been in and out of mental hospitals for years . " She has n't spoken to me in seven years , " Conroy said . " When Mom was dyin ' , my sister said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't write about me . ' I said , ' There 's this unfortunate aspect that we 're brother and sister , and your life is my life . ' I find it painful that she does n't speak to me , but there 's nothing I can do about it . " <p> If it had n't been for Conroy , Jason Gould , Streisand 's 24-year- old son by her ex-husband Elliott Gould , might not have been cast , no matter that his mother said she has very " maternal " feelings for her cast when she directs . <p> " My mother thought I looked too old for the part , " the self-effacing Gould said respectfully . " And we were worried about accusations of nepotism , but Pat Conroy said , ' He looks like the kid I wrote about . ' I know her now in a way I would n't have been able to if we had n't worked together . " I was a very shy kid and not comfortable being the son of very famous people . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shyness and getting to know myself better . I think my mother is a wonderful director . She 's a very sensitive person so she understands the insecurity of an actor . " <p> EVER since he was a kid and " made little Godzilla " movies with his pals in the neighborhood , Gould has wanted to direct . He looks to Martin Scorsese as a model because " his work is very vibrant and alive and he 's not afraid to explore darkness , to bring out the dark side of people . I 'm not interested in shlock . " <p> " Do I have a demand for perfection ? " his mother asks . " Yes , but I 'm striving for excellence more than perfection . There are limits that everybody has and that life has . I accept it more easily now , and there 's a beauty in it too  --  like Indians who sew a flaw into the blanket because life is never perfect . Perfection is imperfection . I said that when I was 15 , and I 'm still saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like a bit of a mistake here and there . "
