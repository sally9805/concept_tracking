<p> Ever since he was a Nerf-toting 4-year-old , Ryan Leaf dreamed of going from Montana to being like Montana : That 's Great Falls , Mont. , his hometown , to Joe Montana , the record-setting quarterback . <p> That NFL dream made Leaf bypass the big-name schools in favor of Washington State . Instead of being just another blue chip in a top 10 football casino , he chose to lead a team built around him . He is being groomed as an NFL quarterback , the latest in a long line from Washington State . <p> " Some schools are made for Heisman Trophy winners , " Leaf says . " And some , like Washington State , produce NFL quarterbacks . I want to be an NFL quarterback . " <p> He chose a good place to learn the trade . Washington State might not get the notoriety of quarterback factories such as Miami or Brigham Young , but its output is impressive . Jack Thompson set NCAA records in the 1970s , Mark Rypien went on to be a Super Bowl MVP with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury spoiled his NFL career . <p> Then there 's Drew . They do n't bother with his last name in Cougars country because what Michael is to the Bulls , Drew Bledsoe is to WSU . <p> Ready to stake his claim is the current Cougars quarterback . Remember his name : Every fall , Leaf turns a little more golden . <p> " He 's very aggressive , he 's very athletic and he 's very emotional , " coach Mike Price says . " And he 's getting better every day at the mental part . " <p> Leaf always has been a great athlete , dominating in every sport as a kid and learning to walk when he was 7 months old . He stands 6-5 and is 240 pounds . He runs a 4.7-second 40-yard dash , bench-presses 350 pounds and has a 35-inch vertical jump . <p> " I thought he was Superman after the first year we played against him , " Washington coach Jim Lambright says . " We could n't even slow him down . He has all the physical tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambright had the pleasure of watching Leaf 's first start in which he threw for 291 yards and a touchdown . After two seasons ( one as the full-time starter ) he 's thrown for 3,133 yards and 25 TDs  --  and , although he needs work on his technique , he 's looked good enough that Price is hoping for a disappointing season . <p> " If he does n't have a great year this year , he 'll probably stay with us , " Price says . " If he has a great year , he 'll probably consider going to the NFL . " <p> Bledsoe left for the New England Patriots after his junior season . Price hopes the quick exit does n't become part of Washington State 's vaunted quarterback tradition . <p> " Big , strong quarterbacks like to come to Washington State , " says Price , who performs double duty as the team 's quarterbacks coach . " They can see themselves as the next Bledsoe or Leaf . <p> " We bring a recruit in here and we say , ' Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's where John Elway grew up . Did you know he 's from Pullman ? So is Timm Rosenbach . And here is Jack Thompson 's house . Did you know he broke all the NCAA records ? ' <p> " Combine that with the way we run our offense , which features the quarterback , and that 's a tough pitch to beat . " <p> It 's the pitch that made Leaf select the Cougars ahead of UCLA , Colorado , Oregon and Miami , Fla . <p> " It 's a place where if you work hard you are in a good position to play professional football , " Leaf says . <p> " It has a big-time quarterback tradition , but that can be tough sometimes , too . They kind of tabbed me as the next Drew Bledsoe , and that 's an impossible thing to live up to . ( When people say that ) I tell them , ' Thank you , ' because it 's a great compliment , but I do n't think it 'll mean anything until I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-pro . " <p> Grooming passers <p> The Pacific Northwest continues to be fertile ground for producing great college and pro quarterbacks . While Ryan Leaf is the latest in the line from Washington State , just across the state line  --  8 miles away  --  Division I-AA Idaho also is known for its passing attack . The Cougars ' intrastate rival Washington , a Pac-10 power , has turned out 11 NFL quarterbacks . <p> IDAHO Player Years Career yds/TDs Pro experience Ken Hobart 1980-83 9,300/79 1 year in NFL John Friesz 1986-89 10,697/77 ' 97 Seattle starter Doug Nussmeier 1990-93 10,824/91 ' 97 New Orleans backup Ryan Fien 1996 3,674/27 ' 97 Oakland camp <p> WASHINGTON Player Years Career yds/TDs Pro experience Don Heinrich 1949-52 4,392/33 8 years in NFL Sonny Sixkiller 1970-72 5,496/35 2 years in NFL Warren Moon 1975-77 3,277/19 ' 97 Seattle backup Tom Flick 1976-80 3,171/24 5 years in NFL Steve Pelluer 1980-83 4,603/30 8 years in NFL Hugh Millen 1984-85 2,616/11 10 years in NFL Chris Chandler 1984-87 4,161/32 ' 97 Atlanta starter Cary Conklin 1986-89 4,850/31 6 years in NFL Billy Joe Hobert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 97 Jacksonville ( inj . ) Damon Huard 1992-95 5,692/34 ' 97 Miami camp <p> WASHINGTON STATE Player Years Career yds/TDs Pro experience Jack Thompson 75-78 7,818/53 6 years in NFL Mark Rypien 81-85 4,573/28 ' 97 St. Louis backup Timm Rosenbach 86-88 5,995/39 5 years in NFL Drew Bledsoe 90-92 7,373/46 ' 97 New England starter Ryan Leaf 95- 3,133/25  - -  @28904 <p> Giuseppe Galderisi , run out of New England last year by a critical coach , is returning to Major League Soccer 's Revolution . <p> The veteran forward was traded Wednesday by Tampa Bay along with midfielder Ivan McKinley to the Revolution for forward Chiquinho Conde and defender/midfielder Sam George . <p> Galderisi , 34 , a former Italian star who 's had surgery on both knees this season , has scored five goals and six assists in 16 matches for the Mutiny . <p> He had seven goals and eight assists last year after leaving New England in May following an acrimonious relationship with coach Frank Stapleton , who quit in the offseason . <p> Conde , 31 , a longtime Portuguese pro star who captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assists in 17 matches for New England , which has the league 's lowest-ranked offense . <p> McKinley , 28 , started 14 games for Tampa Bay ; George , 27 , started 10 for New England . <p> Who 's No. 1 ?
