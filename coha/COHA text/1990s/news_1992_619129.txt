<p> Increasingly , doctors , researchers and food manufacturers see such common foods as garlic , ginger , onions and fish oil as prescriptions for better health . <p> In fact , in the last few years a new word , " nutraceuticals , " has emerged to describe these food substances that appear to bridge the gap between edibles and drugs . <p> The phrase  --  coined in 1989 by the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine , an independent organization devoted to nurturing advances in health care  --  encompasses everything from isolated nutrients to genetically engineered " designer " foods of the future . <p> Whether nutraceuticals take the form of a vitamin , a candy bar bolstered with beneficial compounds or a special diet , they 're distinguished by their health-promoting or disease-defeating promises : <p> * Onions and garlic , for instance , may demonstrate an ability to prevent blood clots , lower blood pressure and maybe even thwart cancer . <p> * Ginger may play the role of a potent anti-coagulant , and also has been reported to lower blood cholesterol . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The list goes on : there 's beta-carotene ( to possibly prevent lung cancer ) , magnesium ( to treat diabetic hypertension ) and calcium ( to prevent osteoporosis , cancer and hypertension ) . <p> CREDIBLE RESEARCH <p> " Foods are really big packages of drugs , " with thousands of compounds mixed together offering showers of protection , says Jean Carper , author of " The Food Pharmacy " ( Bantam , 1988 ) , a ground- breaking book detailing the link between diet and health . <p> While generations of mothers have cajoled us into drinking our ( calcium-rich ) milk and eating our ( beta-carotene-stocked ) carrots for better health , never before have scientists and physicians backed them up with such credible research as now exists . <p> Yesteryear , " we looked at food as a source of nutrition . Now we look at food as a way of preventing disease , " says Gilbert A. Leveille , vice president for research and technical services for the Nabisco Food Group . <p> " It used to be rare to find highly qualified scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minerals , " says Carper , a respected authority on health and nutrition . <p> She credits the change in attitude to both a wider acceptance of foreign medical research and advances in U.S. medical theory and technology . <p> CLINICAL EVIDENCE <p> Many of the claims that certain foods and food elements can treat or prevent human disease have raised strong objections from nutrition experts , and Dr. David Kessler , the new chief of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , recently launched a crackdown on unfounded health claims that appear on some food labels . <p> According to Dr. Edward Remmers of the American Council on Science and Health , a nonpartisan watchdog organization that evaluates foods and chemicals , many theories that individual foods or food components can prevent or cure illnesses " can not be substantiated " by well-controlled scientific studies . <p> Yet there 's mounting clinical evidence coming into the mainstream of medical practice in support of nutraceuticals , says Dr. Richard Rivlin , head of the nutrition research program at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center and professor of medi- cine at Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of university-based clinical studies indicating that calcium may help prevent colon cancer , niacin may prevent recurrent heart attacks and vitamin A may be used to treat measles . Currently , a study at Harvard University has 22,000 physicians around the nation taking daily doses of beta-carotene  --  or a placebo  --  to see if the substance aids in cancer prevention . <p> Since September , 1990 , the National Cancer Institute has been busy trying to identify and isolate the most promising anti-carcinogenic substances in foods ranging from garlic and licorice root to parsley and soybeans . <p> The stakes are great : The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 35 percent of all cancer deaths are linked to diet . <p> The institute 's five-year , $ 20 million program aims to determine the quantities of the food or substance needed to produce beneficial effects . <p> Rather than consume 20 oranges to get any benefit , for instance , a consumer might be able to get it all from a single glass of specially formulated juice . <p> " The idea is to formulate special foods enriched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Foundation for Innovation in Medicine . " You can produce vast quantities of these compounds through laboratory synthesis and bioengineering . Then you add them to any food you please  --  spinach , fruit juice , sorbet . " <p> DeFelice foresees nutraceuticals in such forms as a diabetic candy bar with magnesium . <p> FUTURE FOODS <p> Is the marketplace ready ? <p> " ' Healthy ' will be the brand buzzword of 1992 , " says Martin Friedman , the editor of New Product News , which monitors trends in the food industry . <p> Down the line , he sees increased emphasis on beta-carotene and anti-oxidants ( chemicals that can block the formation of carcinogens ) in the health foods business , followed by mainstream products . <p> " Future foods will be here sooner than we think , " predicted Leveille of Nabisco at a recent outlook conference at the United States Department of Agriculture . " Both the market demand and the technological know-how are well on their way to defining and delivering such a food supply . " <p> An infatuation with nutraceuticals should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to worry about such things , " says Leveille of Nabisco . " A half-century ago , people were concerned about getting enough food to meet nutrition needs . Now they want to improve their quality of life in later years . " <p> " Medicine is in crisis , " offers Dr. Jeffrey Bland , president of HealthComm , a research and educational firm specializing in foods for special diets . <p> " People are not satisfied with the way doctors are meeting patients ' needs , " and nutraceuticals offer an alternative , says Bland . Moreover , " the baby boom generation is entering its mid- and later years and they want to be fit and vital . " <p> ALLOWABLE CLAIMS <p> Still , a few obstacles stand in the way of the introduction of many nutraceuticals to the public . <p> Under the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Health Act , the only medical claims allowable on food labels include sodium 's contribution to high blood pressure , the role of fiber and reduced fat in preventing cancer of the colon and heart disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well supported by nonexclusive scientific evidences . <p> At present , a manufacturer seeking to label a food product with a medical claim must submit that product under a drug classification . <p> Then , the proposed product gets subjected to rigorous and costly safety and efficacy testing  --  a process that can cost more than $ 200 million and take a decade or longer from the start of testing to Food and Drug Administration approval . <p> " In effect , this removes any financial incentive for private companies to invest in research , development and marketing of innovative products and product uses , " says Dr. William Curran , professor of legal medicine at Harvard University , who also serves on the board of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine . <p> Last month , to speed up that process , the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine issued a 40-page white paper , urging the the FDA to provide an economic and regulatory base for a more vigorous research-grounded nutraceutical industry . <p> The foundation hopes to get the FDA to grant nutraceuticals a status similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval process . <p> NATURE OF FOODS <p> Although the line between pharmacy and supermarket may blur , no one envisions dinner-in-a- pill in the future . <p> " I do n't see a major change in the kinds of foods people eat , but rather , a change in the nature of the foods they eat , " says Leveille . " We need to keep intact the sensory benefits of a product . " <p> Already , for instance , food scientists at Purdue University have discovered that by feeding chickens a drug commonly prescribed for humans to lower serum cholesterol  --  lovastatin  --  they can significantly reduce the cholesterol content in an egg without adversely affecting the egg or the health of the chicken . ( At present , the drug is too expensive to put into chicken feed . ) <p> " People will shop for satiety , pleasure and taste , " says Bland of HealthComm . " Therapeutic application is secondary . But a growing segment is seeking out food and nutrients to improve its ( well-being ) and reduce symptoms of illness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any proposed designer foods  --  indeed , Nestle recently pulled Fruition , a beta carotene-fortified juice , from test markets because of sluggish sales . <p> Nevertheless , " every major company has to be in a position to know what 's happening and adapt to what may be the likely outcome , " says Leveille . <p> Giants such as Quaker Oats  --  which boasts a line of nutraceuticals running from its hot cereals to Gatorade and Pritikin products  --  are monitoring the marketplace with vested interest . <p> As for Nabisco , Leveille says , " there 's no plan to launch a beta- carotene fortified cookie tomorrow . " <p> In the meantime , it certainly ca n't hurt most of us to load up on garlic , pile our plate with onions or feast on carrots . <p> A GLOSSARY OF NUTRACEUTICALS <p> Here are a few of the most promising nutraceuticals , where they 're found and ways in which they can be used , according to the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine :  --  Beta-carotene ( red , orange and green leafy vegetables ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tumors . <p> * Calcium ( dairy products ) : Effective in preventing osteoporosis , and possibly high blood pressure and cancer . <p> * Fish oil : Used to treat and prevent high blood pressure and rheumatoid arthritis . <p> * Garlic : May help prevent atherosclerosis , killing germs , slowing tumor growth . <p> * Indoles ( from vegetables in the cabbage family , including broccoli , cauliflower , Brussels sprouts ) : Helpful in neutralizing carcinogens . <p> * Magnesium ( Lemons , grapefruit , cantaloupe , nuts , dark green vegetables ) : May be effective in the treatment and prevention of diabetic hypertension and cardiovascular disease . <p> * Niacin ( meat ) : May reduce cholesterol ( when taken in large doses , prescribed by a physician ) and prevent recurrent heart attacks . <p> * Phyto-chemicals ( chemicals found in plants ) : Cancer prevention . <p> * Ubiquinones ( spinach , lettuces , kale ) : Reduce damage from heart attacks . <p> * Vitamin A ( fish liver oil , green and yellow vegetables , liver , dairy products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles .
