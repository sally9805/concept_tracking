Marquette Henley 's stepson , Lance , had always been a distant boy , dull-eyed and solitary , not at all like the eager young athletes Marquette waited on in his store . Lance spent most of his time watching television with the lights off and the curtains drawn . Blond and pale-eyed , he had skin that seemed to whiten with each passing year . His few friends were sunken-chested boys whose black shirts and stringy hair and furtive whispers floating over the night lawn were as chilling to Marquette as space creatures might have been . <p> Lance was a bitter disappointment to Marquette , who , as the owner of a sporting goods store , saw himself the gatekeeper to a young man 's paradise . For years , boys had come to him for their jockstraps and cleats . He had taught them how to oil and tie their gloves and knew by a sniff of the leather just how long they should leave them tied under their mattresses . <p> Though never much of an athlete himself , Marquette was a listener , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Williams , " he enjoyed telling the ones buying new bats , " Ted says you have to look at the ball a very special way . " As he spoke , Marquette would lean out over an imaginary plate and widen his eyes so intently that the boys would also lean with their gaze fixed on the imaginary pitcher . " It 's coming at you ... it 's coming and all the while it's. coming you never even blink  --  not once , because you have to magnetize it . You have to draw it in with your eyes , with your brain , with your will , with your heart , and then . . . then you can hit it ! " he would cry with a click of his tongue and a long wide swing that contained no bat , no ball , but the power to make their eyes glow so openly and purely that sometimes he thought he could see straight through to their hearts . <p> In the forty years of Marquette 's bachelorhood , he had never given much thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the two of them fishing , canoeing , hiking , tossing the ball back and forth . . . I 'd like you to meet my son . . . Hello , son . . . My son will help you . . . My son , whom I have taught everything I know . . . . My son . . . So on the day that Edna followed her five-year-old son into the store , Marquette could n't keep his eyes off the child . Lance led his mother up and down the aisles until he found what he had come for , the penknives , which he examined carefully , opening them and holding each one to the light . It fascinated Marquette the way all this was witnessed by the mother , who stood off to the side , waiting , never advising or commenting  --  but watching . <p> When the selection had finally been made and paid for , she trailed the little boy outside with a faint , bemused smile . Marquette 's heart beat hard . There was so much of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach churned with that same old longing , that excess he bore like an undelivered fetus . He wanted a son he could mold and instruct in his own image . Lance had seemed the perfect candidate . Even then , there had been this sense of vastness about the boy , a strange , compelling emptiness . <p> One day , when the boy was thirteen , Marquette came home from . work early and found him watching a show on space flight . The darkened room was closely sweet with a fragrance that reminded Marquette of incense . It made him feel lightheaded and happy . The murky haze of the television 's reflection seemed to cloak Lance in an eerie phosphorescence . On the screen , a silver-nosed rocket had just been launched . It cut through a layer of thick white clouds , then screamed into the brightness of space . <p> " Imagine ! " said Marquette , easing down onto the arm of the couch . " Imagine what a feeling , to be so high up and far away from everything ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breath away , does n't it ? " Marquette said , leaning closer to the set . <p> " Yeah , " Lance said with a dreamy laugh . <p> The next day Marquette brought home a book on rockets , a poster of the Apollo astronauts , and three scale models of spaceships . Eventually , these ended up in the same closet with all the unused baseball gloves and skis and soccer balls and fishing rods . <p> It was n't long after that Marquette read in the paper that the astronaut Harry L. Baker would be passing through Atkinson on his way north to the state capital . Marquette saw how he might kill two birds with one stone : get a little publicity for the store , and at the same time , do something to impress the boy and fire his . lackluster imagination . <p> A few days later with Lance and the photographer from The Weekly Crier beside him in the car , Marquette was pursuing the astronaut 's motorcade up the highway . Finally , with flashing lights and frantic hand signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft shoulder . There , he presented the bewildered astronaut an oak plaque proclaiming Harry L. Baker an <p> HONORARY CITIZEN OF ATKINSON , VERMONT HOME OF THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS AND FREE MEN EVERYWHERE . <p> Compliments of <p> HENLEY 'S SPORTING GOODS CO . MARQUETTE J. HENLEY , PROP . <p> Lance looked on expressionlessly from the car . When Marquette called him to join them in the picture , Lance shook his head . Then the astronaut gestured for him to come , but Lance looked away . <p> " He 's shy , " Marquette said . <p> " Here , " Baker said , scribbling his name on the back of an envelope . " For his scrapbook . " <p> " Most boys would give their right arm for a chance just like that , " Marquette complained to Edna that night . " And he just sat there like a lump of cold lard , like a rock ! " <p> Edna had been listening with the intense , quizzical scrutiny that had always puzzled him . " Maybe he was afraid , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's never afraid . He 's never anything , " Marquette said . <p> Edna thought about this a moment . " Maybe he just does n't like space . " <p> " Maybe he just does n't like anything , " Marquette said . " Including me , " he added , and he could tell by the way she blinked and stared past him that she was considering this as a real possibility . The blurry , poster-sized picture taken that day of Marquette and astronaut Baker still hangs in the store 's front window . It has been the incongruous backdrop for ten seasons of ice skates , and Little League trophies , and ski parkas , and rubber hip waders . It is faded now and sagging and the edges are curled and brittle . But Marquette can not bring himself to remove it . That picture is as much a part of his store as it is of his life . If the occasion did not impress Lance , the picture has left its mark in the minds of a whole generation of Atkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they still come in to ask about Baker . <p> " He 's a real pioneer , " Marquette tells this one , leaning over the glass case of hunting knives and starter pistols . " When nobody knew what was up there , when nobody really knew , Harry L. Baker made it his business to find out , " Marquette says with a wink and a nod . " There are n't many men like that left , son . " <p> " He ever show you any stuff ? " the boy asks . " Like moon rocks or space food or stuff like that ? " His eyes burn eagerly . <p> " I 've seen it all , " Marquette says . " All that and more . " <p> " He ever give you anything ? " the boy asks . <p> " Well , this is all I got on me right now , " Marquette says , pulling from his wallet a frayed , folded envelope . Carefully , he opens the soft worn squares and holds it out . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' And best wishes , Harry L. Baker . ' " He looks up expectantly . " Is this all you got ? " <p> The boy 's hair smells sweet , of sweat and soap . Marquette feels perilously lightheaded and dizzy with the sudden closeness of another human being . It has been years since he has been this near anyone . <p> " Do n't ! " the boy is saying . His sharp elbows strike Marquette 's soft belly . " Cut it out ! " he cries . <p> For an odd , giddy moment , Marquette wonders why he is here in the midst of these strange shapes and colors . The circular rack of red hunting jackets spins round and round , and overhead , the yellow rubber raft sways back and forth on invisible wires . The knife blades glint . The boy is gone . The store is empty . Marquette begins to dust the tackle boxes with the sleeve of his flannel shirt . He rubs and rubs , and his cuff button clicking against the metal tops is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's father comes to the house . <p> " Sometimes kids get things confused , " he says . His hands are jammed into his pockets , his shoulders shrug self-consciously . " They think you . . . they think something 's wrong that 's just . . . well . . . " He stretches his neck and grimaces . " How can I say this ? " <p> Over his shoulder , Marquette sees the wife staring at them from the car . Her grim white face curdles with anger . <p> " . . . as good a man as you , " the man is saying . " But my boy was kind of upset and then the wife got all shook , so I figured I just better come by and see what 's what . You know what I mean ? " the man asks . <p> " No , " Marquette says firmly , his eyes steady on the man 's . " I do n't . " <p> The man shifts his weight from foot to foot , then glances back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained on him like shotgun barrels . The man 's face reddens . " Did you hug my boy today ? Did you do that , Mr. Henley ? " <p> " Of course not , " Marquette says . <p> " I did n't think so , " the man says with an anxious backward shuffle . <p> Edna was a private woman . Stout and given to fits of nervous giggling and blushing when in the limelight , she welcomed the anonymity of her tiny husband 's long shadow . The father of Edna 's son had been a welder for the railroad . The first time Edna ever saw him , it was his welding mask and thick asbestos mitts and the mantle of orangey red sparks about his wide shoulders that set her heart afire . His name was Cobbie something . Or something Cobbie . Either ie or y , she would never be sure . But for her infant son 's sake , she would christen him Lance Cobbie . For the first five years of the boy 's life , right up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlington , New York City , Hartford , Boston , Portland , all under the pretext of visiting the boy 's father . <p> These trips ceased when the boy told a neighbor how much he dreaded those long weekends in dreary hotel rooms , the only respite . being the walks back and forth to the local train yards , where Edna and Lance would stand on one or another of the huge garaging platforms and watch the trains being repaired . Like great hungry beacons , Edna 's small bright eyes would search for Cobbie . With their masks on , all the welders looked alike . Even so , it was a futile mission , because Edna could never be sure exactly for whom she looked . <p> Her brief relationship with Cobbie had been on a moonlit park bench and , later , that same fateful night , in the garage , in the whispery back-seat shadows of her father 's DeSoto . <p> For the next nine months , whenever Edna tried to picture what the baby would look like , all that came to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welder 's fiercely square and pitted mask . It was a strange relief to see the infant 's pale hair and squalling red face , looking so wonderfully human and yet completely unlike any other face Edna had ever known . <p> Of course , Marquette knew nothing of Edna 's secret . He knew as much of Edna 's past as did anyone in town ; of the little known were these fictions and suppositions : that Cobbie was a wanderer or a drinker or both , and that it was to Edna 's credit that she had finally come to her senses after the elopement and made the break for the boy 's sake . <p> There had been no elopement , no divorce . And if it had n't been for Lance , Edna would not have even been certain of Cobbie 's existence , so dim has her memory of that night become , so astonished , as the years have passed , is she by her passion . <p> For the past twenty years , Edna has been a steady , but disappointing , wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loyalties that he finds wanting . Whenever he and Lance disagree , Edna , whether by actual assent or just the keen narrow brightening of her eyes , always sides with her son . And yet it bewilders Marquette the way she has always treated Lance , like a guest , like someone she does not yet know well enough to scold or criticize . <p> Since high school , Lance has worked only once  --  as a milkman 's assistant , a job that lasted five and a half months . <p> " It was n't his fault . He just hit the tail end of milk routes , " she explains in the dry , somber tones of a sociology professor to whomever is unlucky enough to have inquired . " And then Nixon took such a hard tack on unemployment , " she laments , circum-ferencing Lance 's failures with U.S. economic policy . " And the poor boy lost his benefits . " <p> Sometimes , Marquette catches her up short , depending on his own economic condition . Business is way off . Weekdays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He blames the discount stores . But what can a small businessman do ? And to make matters worse , Flyer 's has just come to the mall . Flyer 's is a huge discount sporting goods chain from California . They can undersell anyone . All the college football games on TV have Flyer 's ads at half-time . <p> " The poor boy lost his benefits because he would n't look for work ! Plain and simple , " Marquette scoffs , and Edna 's bright face shatters inward like a broken headlight . <p> Somehow , Lance always has money . Marquette suspects that Edna slips it to him when he comes to visit . Lance spends most of his nights in a trailer near the fairgrounds . The trailer belongs to a divorcee named Barb , as do the two children , a boy and a girl Lance often brings to supper after Barb leaves for work . She is a cocktail waitress at the Fairspot . <p> Tonight , Marquette is trying to read the newspaper . From time to time , he glances at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little girl 's name is Dawn . She toddles from the end table to the television and then drops down on all fours and scurries in a crawl to get to Lance , who sleeps on the couch , face-down , one arm dangling to the floor . She hitches herself up and peers at the crumpled profile that is always too soft , too smooth , boneless , Marquette thinks . Lance 's skin is now paler than it has ever been . He reminds Marquette of someone he used to know . Suddenly , he realizes that Lance reminds him of Lance ; that if it is possible , Lance has become a ghost of himself , a sourceless shadow . <p> The little girl 's brother is in the kitchen where he waits for Edna to lift him onto the counter top . He likes to sit there and watch her wash dishes . Edna enjoys the children . <p> They seem afraid of Marquette . He pays them little attention . They make him feel uneasy , soiled somehow . Their trail of crumbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow-chested boys in black shirts . He is as confused as to where these two children fit into his life as he was about those boys . <p> The little girl is pulling Lance 's ear . She wants him to wake up . <p> " Jesus Christ ! " Lance howls , shaking his head so abruptly that she teeters and falls back on her diapered bottom . <p> " C'mere , " Marquette whispers . He moves the cup and saucer and pats the chair arm for her to come . She smiles and the way she comes towards him is frightening . She moves like a crab , determined , yet off-balance , off-center , a fearsome little gust , a blur of hands and feet and bobbing head and eyes that widen eagerly , hungrily . <p> " Sit down ! " he commands , pointing both at her and the floor as she reaches him . She begins to cry then , and Edna , with the little boy on her hip , rushes in from the kitchen . The suddenness of her approach terrifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled ; his head snaps back , expecting a scolding from Edna . But it is the child over whom she looms . " Sh , sh , " she hisses . " Let Lance sleep , now . Sh ! " <p> Marquette has been at the Berwick Hotel for a week . It is almost midnight and he is hungry , but he will not pay the extra charge for room service . For the first week and a half after he left home , he slept in his office at the store . But then the pain began in his chest and shoulders . It radiates down his arms . He feels both weightless and compressed . The whole town knows what has happened and he is ashamed . Most disturbing of all , though , is Edna 's reaction ; she was surprised , puzzled  --  at times , almost amused . <p> In the bluish tint of the television screen , he sits on the bed and holds the remote control straight out in front of himself . Squinting , he pushes the button . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman 's head , a blur of racing cars , a can of dog liver , a woman 's naked chest . . . He cocks his head and flicks back just as the woman pulls a sheet up to her chin . <p> With the remote control still aimed at the set , Marquette waits to see if she will drop the sheet . He has never seen anything like this before . Certainly not on television . He has never seen Edna 's breasts , in lamplight or daylight . When the woman does not move , Marquette raises the control and again begins his scan of the channels . He keeps zipping back to the woman with the sheet to her chin , as if he might surprise her , catch her unaware . <p> The red button on the telephone has been flashing all night . Marquette is not sure what that means . It has been doing it all day long . Marquette has been in bed since last night . Early this morning , he called the store and , pinching his nose , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He pushes the button on the remote control now and nothing happens . The channel stays the same . When he dials the front desk , the clerk is confused by his complaint . <p> " What 's a power source ? " the clerk asks . <p> " For the TV , " Marquette almost shrieks . " It 's gone ! Dead ! Kaput ! " <p> The clerk delivers the new remote control himself . Marquette seizes it hungrily through the crack in the doorway . <p> " Excuse me , Mr. Henley , " the clerk says before the door closes . " Your light 's blinking , sir . " He points and Marquette looks back . " There 's a message on the board for you . " The clerk reads from an index card . " Please call Mrs. Henley . It is urgent . " <p> Marquette gives him a quarter and closes the door . He turns the power source on the set and eases himself onto the bed with the small plastic box still perfectly aimed . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of cocaine in Lance 's bedroom . He was arrested at home . The Crier had a front-page shot of Lance , head down and manacled , being led to a waiting cruiser . <p> Marquette had tried to block the door . But the troopers had a search warrant . While Edna sat in the kitchen , staring numbly at the passing uniforms , Marquette called his lawyer , then Judge Riordan and every other influential person he could think of . <p> " You 're only making it worse , " Edna whispered . <p> He stopped dialing . " I am making it worse ? I am trying to do something ! You act like it 's happening to someone else  --  like it 's none of your business . " <p> A young trooper came into the kitchen then . When he saw Mrs. Henley , he removed his wide-brimmed hat and , as gently as possible , said , " We 're having to take a few of the floorboards up , ma'am . " He nodded and backed off . " Just so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Marquette roared . " You ca n't do this ! I wo n't allow it ! " He picked up a golf club and swung at the young trooper , just missing his chest . <p> " Put down the club , sir , " the trooper said softly . <p> Marquette blinked . He recognized this young man . Hockey skates and fishing rods . So this was one whose feet he measured year after year , bringing him as surely to manhood as any father . <p> " Put down the club , sir ! " the young trooper ordered , snapping his pistol from its holster . <p> Still trying to catch the naked woman with her sheet down , Marquette pushes the buttons on the remote control . He searches for her from channel to channel , through the jittery spectrum of images , but she is nowhere to be found . Back again , he goes through a chewing gum ad , Hawaii Five-O , a rat being consumed by a wet , writhing snake , an astronaut playing golf on the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clicks back to the astronaut . It is Harry L. Baker in his puffy white spacesuit , teeing up in the barren , dusty center of a moon crater . Baker 's long , easy swing makes Marquette smile . Weightlessly , the ball sails into the air , lifting higher and higher into the blackness of space , the small white orb diminishing to a pinprick of light until , like a dying star , it is no more . Now , Harry L. Baker 's dimpled , boyish face fills the screen . " Whatever your sporting needs , wherever you are , " he grins , holding up a brand-new package of orange golf balls , " there 's a Flyer 's nearby . " <p> Tears surge in Marquette 's eyes . He clutches at the pain in his chest and slides into the slither of sheets . He feels his body enlarging , becoming more than he has ever been ; it fills this room , fills all of space . <p> The dreary courtroom is a blur of rainy windows and the judge 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ill-fitting yellow sundress , is Barb , four months pregnant . <p> In a way , Edna is relieved that Marquette is not here . Through the years , his constant pursuit of Lance had always alarmed her . Often , when Marquette was lecturing Lance , she would see the boy cringe with such intensity that his eyes would sink deep into his head and his features would begin to dissolve , as if he were turning himself inside out with only the frayed seams showing . It would occur to her at these times that she might lose Lance ; that as swiftly and completely as his father had vanished , so could he . When he expressed interest in going to college , she said nothing and was relieved when he changed his mind . When he lost the milk route job , she was again relieved . For too many nights , she had dreamed the same dream . In it , Lance drove the truck delivering milk from house to house along a lengthening street of endless houses . As she watched , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance , until he was gone forever , like his father , of whom she no longer dreamed , but was certain he mended tracks from coast to coast , from pole to pole , wherever he was needed . <p> Once on television , she saw the aftermath of a horrible rail disaster in Chile , where a passenger train dangled from the spliced tracks that had once bridged a steep mountain pass . Workmen crawled alongside , attempting to separate the hanging car from the ones still on the track . Among them was a welder . It 's him , she almost screamed ; him with his fiery cowl and thick , bristled hair and metal face . <p> When the constables lead Lance into the courtroom , Barb squeezes Edna 's hand . " He looks so different , " Barb whispers . " Like he 's been locked up for years . " <p> He looks back and winks as the constables unlock the manacles on his wrists . The clank of the metal startles Edna . She was remembering the young boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so noisy ; the clanging , banging , coupling of cars . Engines churning , turning full speed ; the screeching metal of the brakes ; the welder 's sparks like fiery rain over all these people , this coughing , shuffling commotion of bodies . . . <p> " Is there anything you wish to say ? " the judge is asking Lance . <p> In profile , he is still a stranger to her . Every day of his life , she has watched him , studied him , has even gotten into the habit of coming upon him suddenly as if to disarm him , to discover what he really looked like , who he really was . He has never been a son so much as an ambassador from a strange , exotic land , the emissary of the iron-faced man . <p> Nothing Lance did ever surprised her . She found him fascinating . As he grew older , she would not punish him for his recklessness . She never lectured him , never nagged or forced him to do a thing he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were the window through which she might discover the mystery of her dark lover . <p> When he sang , she heard his father 's song , melodious and as deep as dark water . When he broke out in hives , she knew his father was allergic to strawberries . And when a woman as pretty as Barb would love him , she could be flattered that the father had chosen her that night in the park . <p> " Is there anything you wish to say before sentencing ? " the judge repeats . <p> Barb clenches her hand and presses her shoulder into Edna 's . " Dear God , " she whispers . Tears run down her cheeks . <p> Lance has been rubbing his chin , thinking . He lifts his head . <p> Cool as a cucumber , Edna notes . Even under pressure like this , he is steady and thoughtful and unafraid . <p> " No , sir , " Lance says . " Nothing that would make any difference . " <p> " Three years , " the judge says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He bangs his gavel . <p> " Three years , it is , " Lance says with a shrug . He holds up his hands for the manacles , and as they are snapped shut , Edna marvels at the steely tinges of his flesh without sunlight . It is , she thinks , a priestly pallor . <p> That very night , she dreams of Lance on his old milk route . The wire case he carries contains no milk , but the diminutive form of a caged man . <p> A great peace has come over Edna . Every weekend , she and Barb pack a picnic lunch and drive to the state prison to visit Lance . <p> " Oh ! " Barb says , closing her eyes . " It 's kicking so hard , my ribs ache . " <p> Edna smiles over the wheel . She passes the road that would take them to the cemetery where Marquette is buried . On the back , she thinks , knowing full well it will be too dark and Barb will be too tired again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORRIS is the author of the novels Vanished and A Dangerous Woman , both of which were published by Viking .
