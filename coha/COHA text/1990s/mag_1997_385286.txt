We knew all the awful stuff about the place-the incredible isolation , the deadly cold , the fear of the unknown . " Antarctica is the harshest place on earth , " admitted Ernst H. " Kass " Kastning III , a 19-year-old Eagle Scout . " It is an inhospitable , icy desert . " Why in the world would he want to go to the bottom of the world ? " Few people have ever been to Antarctica , " Kass explained , " and it is a challenge to even get there . " Kass added that he has " the sheer need to do difficult things and go where one does not belong . " For that , he could not have picked a more perfect place on this planet than Antarctica TEXT OMITTED Antarctica 's climate is the-coldest on earth . The southernmost continent has recorded our planet 's lowest temperature , minus 126.9 degrees Fahrenheit . Including Alaska-size floating ice shelves , Antarctica 's 5.5 million square miles make it more than one and a half times as large as the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ice : A giant sheet covers all but . about 2 percent of the continent Some scientists claim that if this huge ice cube melted , all the oceans worldwide would rise 200 feet and the continent of Antarctica , free of the ice 's weight , would also rise . J Eagle Scouts , Arctic Adventurers Making such predictions is what scientists studying this deep freeze do . And scientific study was why Kass applied to be the eighth Scout in 67 years to assist with big-time science projects in Antarctica . Once every three years now , the Boy Scouts of America Antarctic Scientific Program , cosponsored by the National Science Foundation , selects an Eagle Scout to work in the United States Antarctic Program . Thus Kass , beginning in October 1995 , lived in the Antarctic for three months , along with several thousand other summer-season scientists and support personnel . The Antarctic summer runs from October to February , when temperatures " warm " to barely above zero and the sun never sets . Not surprisingly , only a few hundred folks stick around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Scientist 's Dream Because of its incredible size and isolation , Antarctica offers scientists situations available nowhere else . Its thin and clean air , the best on earth , lets scientists study the atmosphere more easily . They test ice to look for a global warming trend , or " greenhouse effect . " Scuba divers sample pollution-free algae under sea ice . Geologists probe ancient lands . And more . Work seems endless , Kass said . " With the sun up all the time , " he explained , " I found myself not really wanting to sleep , or noticing at any point it was time to sleep . However , if a room I was in became dark , I was asleep in no time . " A Bitter Cold Bite at the Fang Sometimes , Kass found himself forced to sleep . The environment always decided Kass 's day . At one point , his scientific team headed for the 12,448-foot summit of Mount Erebus , an active volcano . A helicopter flew them from sea-level base camp at McMurdo to the Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acclimate , allowing their bodies to adjust to the thinner air of the high altitude before continuing even higher . " Within hours of being dropped off by the helo , " Kass said , " a blizzard hit . " Winds blew 100 miles an hour , pushing temperatures dangerously low . The team had to huddle in tents with only a stove as heat . " I did n't leave my sleeping bag for 17 hours , " Kass said . " I only got up because I was hungry . After eating , I was back in the sleeping bag for another 10-plus hours . " Scientific Study : Another Word for ' Work ' When the weather cooperated , Kass went to work . // <p>
