<p> T he guy has made a mistake . <p> The guy , a local football expert , thinks the 600 or so women assembled at the " For Women Only " football clinic want to hear what he has to say about the game . <p> So he muscles in , interrupting the woman at the mike who 's floating an elegant explanation of offensive terminology . He corrects . He condescends . <p> Then : " Let her talk ! " yells a grandmother type halfway across the Hyatt Regency ballroom . " I want to hear this stuff from her ! " There 's a chorus of irritated yeeeaaahhs ! <p> Jan Wannstedt , the ' her ' in question , just smiles smoothly and launches  --  coincidentally  --  into the definition of a sack . <p> The perky blond wife of Bears head coach Dave Wannstedt is way too gracious , way too focused , to gloat . She does n't have to . By the time this first official appearance as Chicago 's First Lady of Football is over  --  despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed  --  the 40-year-old has got the audience in her hip pocket . <p> Even defensive tackle Chris Zorich , one of the quartet of Bears who participated in the clinic , was wowed . <p> " Geez , " he said . " I think she could teach me a few things about this game . " <p> Maybe so . For nearly 20 years  --  as long as she has been married to Dave  --  Jan Wannstedt has lived football . She has moved with her husband to Oklahoma , to California , to Florida , to Texas . While she ran things at home , raised two daughters , and trained and worked as an interpreter for the deaf , she was watching , and listening , and absorbing the game . <p> Her abiding interest in her husband 's livelihood weathered a little flak even before this season began , when at least one player complained of her presence at training camp in Platteville . <p> " I never sat in on meetings or got in the way  --  I just watched like any other fan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to think I do n't know what 's going on , that I 'm just an extension of Dave . <p> " This is my life . I did n't fall into it ; I chose it . And I know how lucky I am . I thank God every day that it is the way it is . " <p> Still , it never before has been quite the way it is now . Before , her husband was always an assistant coach , and the most intense spotlight was on somebody else . Now , it 's pointedly , sometimes painfully , on the Wannstedts . <p> " It still has n't completely sunk in , that Dave is a big deal , " she says , laughing . " Around here , he 's the guy who takes out the garbage  --  although he 's hardly spent enough time in this house to know where it goes . " <p> The house , a massive , newly built North Shore manse that they 've occupied about a month , is only about half full with the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I sold some things when we left , " she says . " I 'm going to take my time here and pick the right pieces . " Although , she adds with a smile , " I 'm not big on built-ins . I want pieces I can take with me . You never know . " <p> Indeed . The singular uncertainty of such a high-profile , low-security life is n't lost on Jan : " The win-loss thing controls your life . You think about it most on Sundays , of course , and Mondays you start thinking about how to put another ' W ' back on there . It 's part of the job . " <p> Inevitably in this first year , the comparisons to former Bears head coach Mike Ditka are flying thick and fast . <p> " That is n't so bad , because Ditka did a lot for this city , " says Jan . " I know Dave admires him . Two years ago , I had a friend get Ditka 's signature on his autobiography so I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , what the future would bring . <p> " You ca n't sit back and say , ' How are we going to fill the shoes of this legend ? ' You ca n't take the time for that . You just get in there and say , ' Let 's figure out what we have to do here and do it . ' <p> " Mike 's been outstanding to Dave . And when I met Diana ( Ditka ) at a golf outing , she was extremely friendly . She turned an awkward situation into a very comfortable one . I think we all remind ourselves that this kind of change is the nature of the business . We 've all been through it before , and we 'll go through it again . " <p> Not anytime soon , they hope . Yet the bottom line is far from lost on any of the Wannstedts . <p> " You have to understand the mentality of the average fan  --  and I do , " says Dave , whose team is 2-2 going into today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't fool yourself . Nothing else matters . I experienced a situation in Dallas where we had a coach who had taken the team to the Super Bowl , and he was still getting booed . There 's no way you can rest on what you 've done in the past ; you 're only as good as your last game . " <p> Still , says Jan , " We 've always lived this way . We 're real competitive , all of us . It 's in our blood , even the girls , in their own way . I do n't think we 'd know how to live any other way . <p> " One of the things we like best about Chicago  --  one of the things that helped us make the decision to come here  --  is that Chicagoans are like that , too . They love their teams . It 's a real sports town , and that feels good to us . " <p> Maybe that 's because both Wannstedts were born and raised in another true sports town . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of seeing her mom watching the Steelers on TV , one ear plugged into a Pirates game on the radio . <p> " My mom was a single mom  --  that was n't easy in the ' 50s , but she did such a great job  --  and I can remember my brother and sister and cousins and everybody sitting around on Sundays watching football , " she recalls . " In my family , Sundays were for mass and family lunch and football . " <p> So it was natural that in high school she should gravitate toward a young jock named Dave , who eventually would be courted by a host of schools but choose to attend Pitt . She took classes at the small Robert Morris Junior College . After the final game of Dave 's senior year in college , they were married . Their honeymoon was a trip to the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Ariz . <p> Through nearly two decades together , Dave says , " There 's never been a dull moment . <p> " If I had a 9-to-5 job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " But this life has worked for us , brought us closer together . I can remember having two little kids in the car , pulling up to a house in California and thinking we did n't know a soul in the whole state . It 's times like that that you learn to lean on each other . No matter where we are , no matter what 's happening , we lean on each other . " <p> It 's not only the moves that have knit the Wannstedt family unit so tightly , Dave acknowledges . Celebrity makes it difficult to cultivate anything resembling a normal social life . So , he says , you spend a lot of time with the family . <p> " Jan has always gotten involved in church things , and school things , and eventually she drags me along , too . And it never fails : There will be a doctor and a lawyer and a fireman . And all anybody wants to talk about is football . I 'd give anything to talk about something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sound strange , but when we do socialize , it tends to be with the assistant coaches . They 're the only ones I can count on not to talk football all the time . " <p> Jan , whose cool , quick sense of humor belies the fact that she 's " not always real comfortable " in the spotlight , is learning the tricks of the would-be anonymous : Pay in cash at the grocery store instead of writing checks . Dress down at the mall . Do n't , under any circumstances , give out the phone number  --  and guard the address with your life . <p> " I do n't want to make it sound like we do n't like people talking to us , because everyone 's been so nice , and we 're so glad they 're supporting the team , " says Jan . " It 's just that we 're trying to keep some sort of normal family life , for as long as we can . You just try to let your kids grow up as normally as they possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she admits , if daughter Jami , who turns 13 this month , or Keri , 16 , eventually married coaches " or decided to lead a sports life in some way . <p> " We have always followed the three F 's : faith , family and football , " she says . " They see that our family works  --  despite all the moves and the changes . I 'll encourage them to do whatever makes them happy , and if that includes sports , fine . " <p> Though it can be hard on family rhythms  --  the move to Chicago has seemingly been toughest on elder daughter Keri , who 's midway through high school  --  the unpredictable nature of a life led by the Three F 's does , indeed , seem fine with Jan Wannstedt . <p> A year ago , after all , she was leading a series of women 's football clinics for Dallas Cowboys fans . <p> " Now , of course , nobody is better to me than the Chicago Bears , " she says . " It 's strange the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely you feel it when they do . I can honestly say I love the Bears already . And I hope to be cheering them for a long , long time . " @x Doddering Dodd Senate Democratic leadership sources say that there are already internal discussions between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and some members of his inner circle about how to handle Sen. Chris Dodd and the growing concern that his personal finance and conflict of interest scandals will continue to grow . " Right now , Dodd is the poster boy for Democratic politics , " says a leadership aide . " There are serious doubts that he should be allowed to continue in the Senate . " Dodd at this writing trails former Republican congressman Rob Simmons by double digits in early polling for his 2010 reelection bid . Dodd 's special treatment for home refinanc- ing , his pur- chase of an estate in Ireland , which also received favorable treat- ment from the financial sector , and his wife 's conflicts of interest with ties to failed insurer AIG , as well as Dodd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made him a political target for Republicans across the country . Dodd has refused to bend or apologize for his actions , and there is a growing sense among Democratic leaders that he should not be seeking reelection but instead should announce his intent to retire . " There are several congressional and state-level Democrats who could more readily challenge Simmons and win , " says a staffer for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . Recently , the DSCC launched an attack on Simmons , but at the same time , the staffer said , it was an attempt to measure just how much trouble Dodd was in : " If the messaging does n't work , we have a good idea that it is n't so much Simmons as it is about Dodd himself . From there , who knows where this goes ? " AIG in a Hole Some House Republicans are attempting to determine who or what entity may have started the run on AIG , the collapsed insurer , which last fall was the epicenter of the U.S. financial collapse . " There was an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could n't climb out of , " says a Republican staffer on the House Financial Services Committee . " We are trying to pull the string to see where it leads . " The run began because an entity inside AIG known as AIG Financial Products sold insurance protection to banks and brokers on more than $400 billion of mortgage collateralized debt obligations and other fixed income assets . The initial run on AIG , many believe , was caused by rumors that the firm could not meet the initial margin calls . " It would be interesting to see who lit the fuse on the AIG run , and whether there were other intentions in starting the collapse , " says the aide , who would not go into greater detail . The assumption , say some congressional staffers , is that there were political motivations for pushing AIG over the edge , given the timing of the margin call . Meet the Team As expected , senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett is directing much of the political and " third party " outreach from the White House to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUFC ) , as well as the Democratic National Committee . Jarrett routinely holds meeting with leaders of those groups in offices outside the White House , and has been spotted meeting with officials from labor 's SEIU , among other Obama-backing entities . But Jarrett is n't pulling all the strings . Her chief of staff , **26;1530;TOOLONG Michael Str autmanis , a longtime aide to disgraced former Illinois Gov . Rod Blagojevich as well as an early organizer for the Obama campaign , is , according to White House sources , the key driver for AUFC outreach and activities . " Michael is the one who passes along the polling data we have , and gives us the external polling data we get from other groups , " says one source . " Valerie is n't making the day-to-day decisions ; Michael is . " Both Strautmanis and White House deputy chief of start* Jim Messina work closely with chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in coordinating the messaging and advocacy programming that were used to create the impression of support for the Obama budget . A White House official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messina , and Jarrett communicate routinely with about five different groups , all of which were integral to the Obama political machine last fall . Americans United for Change is the key entity , however , as it is now fully inte- grated into the DNC . A number ofAUFC officials , such as former AUFC president Brad Woodhouse , are now DNC employees , and AUFC has been leading the coordinated campaign efforts against Republican congressional leaders . Getting Evan While President Barack Obama has publicly called off attacks against Sen. Evan Bayh and other moderate Democrats who raised doubts about the White House 's budget and stimulus package , he has privately told aides to keep up the pressure on Bayh 's Moderate Democrats Working Group . " We 're not going to let this thing go , " says a White House aide . " Bayh is raising funds and seeking PAC underwriting for his organization . If that 's the kind of game he wants to play , to throw sand in the gears of our legislative efforts , then we have ways to complicate matters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hopes to have about 10 members in his working group , which will meet regularly . At one time Bayh was thought to be a possible Obama running mate or cabinet member . Now , he maybe setting himself up to be the president 's most visible Democratic critic . Present Tense House Republican whip Eric Cantor has become the man conservatives love and love to hate , depending on the day of the week . Cantor angered conser- vatives recently by voting " pres- ent " on legisla- tion related to limiting execu- tive bonuses . He claimed that he did so not because he did n't want to vote against the bill , but because his wife is an executive of a bank that received TARP bailout money . Now Democrats are attempting to determine if Cantor 's wife received a bonus for her work in the 2008 fiscal year . Cantor has been walking a fine line on such issues ever since he persuaded a number of fellow House Republicans to vote for the Bush administration 's initial financial bailout plan , when many wanted to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary Steven Chu is not making a positive impres- sion on his staff inside the depart- ment . Chu arrived with a reputation for being brusque and acting like he was the " smartest guy in the room , " according to current career Energy staffers , and he 's done nothing to soften that impression . " He maybe the smartest guy , but he 's also the most obnoxious , " says one staffer.
