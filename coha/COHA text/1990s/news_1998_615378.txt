<p> Pursued by two armed men along Castle Heights Boulevard as she futilely tapped at the keypad of her wireless phone , Marcia Spielholz drove through a cellular dead zone . <p> Driving through an area where there were no transmitters operated by L.A. Cellular , the company that sold her service , each call the 37-year-old film executive frantically made to 911 was answered with silence . Spielholz could not get her phone to connect and she did n't make it home that night . For Spielholz , the failure to connect was near-fatal , and four years later she struggles to live with the consequences . But others might also shudder at her trauma . Many of America 's 65 million wireless users purchase the phone service only for emergencies , and everyone would like to have a way to call for aid in an emergency . <p> But a wireless phone in a dead zone is like a home phone with its wires cut . <p> And wireless phones are being pressed into emergency service constantly . An estimated 50,000 calls each day are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telephone Industry Association . Lots of holes <p> Each wireless carrier  --  and Atlanta thus far has six  --  prints glossy maps of its " footprint , " the area in which it provides service . But those maps only show the perimeter of coverage , not the dead zones . No map shows the gullies where trees or hills block radio signals . No map shows the side roads and back streets where a company just does n't think it pays to place a cell site . And without enormous investment , no company can guarantee each square foot within its coverage area . <p> Which raises the question : " Do consumers know that ? " <p> Cellular companies pump their service in ways that seemingly suggest coverage is complete . Atlanta-based BellSouth has run ads proclaiming " You 'll Run Out of Gas Before You Run Out of Coverage . " Other companies have ads showing drivers next to broken-down cars talking into wireless phones . Callers to the CTIA who are placed on hold are treated to bromides about wireless phones as a safety tool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and security , " said CTIA spokesman Tim Ayers . Mark Feidler , president of BellSouth Mobility , said he is aware that the company 's coverage is not perfect . <p> " There are holes in the coverage , and the people who use our service for a while understand that , " he said . " The question is , do they understand that at the time of the sale ? We train our ( sales ) people . We tell them that , if asked , they 've got to be honest about it . We make that clear in our contracts with customers . We make that clear in our discovery maps . We 'd like to eliminate those holes , but as a practical matter , that 's not going to happen . " <p> Powertel shows customers a computer-generated model that shows whether there is coverage or not at any point they choose  --  the kids ' school , the road to the office , the mailbox at the end of the driveway . <p> That is n't always enough , said Powertel Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to work perfectly all the time . The expectation is always higher than reality . " <p> Some consumers are new to wireless and see it as a kind of magic . Or they believe the service is provided by satellites  --  not by transmitters whose signal can be blocked by a ridge . <p> The key to avoiding surprises is education , said AirTouch spokeswoman Suzy Deering . " You just have to be realistic . This is a safety tool , but you 've got to use it with common sense . " <p> But Carl Hilliard , an organizer of the Wireless Consumers Alliance , says it is not the fault of users . He blames the carriers for stressing safety without adding the appropriate caveat . <p> The Federal Communications Commission in 1996 ruled that carriers must carry 911 calls , even if the caller is from another company or has no account at all . " They used to block 911 calls if you were not a paid subscriber , " Hilliard said . " Now , the companies carry it , but they fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now calls for technology that connects a 911 call to the strongest signal , no matter who the carrier is . CTIA has an alternative proposal , arguing that the strong signal could come from the site most likely to be busy with other calls . <p> CTIA 's Ayers also said the industry resisted the " take all 911 calls " rule because it makes it easier to call in false alarms from a phone without a traceable number . <p> And any policy under consideration can be disconnected when the technology used by a phone does not mesh with a carrier 's system . Users with some phones can reprogram their phones to improve their chances , but even then , the lifeline sometimes can be horribly cut . <p> A year ago Thanksgiving , the Lechuga family was returning from a stay with relatives east of Los Angeles . Coming through the mountains , their car slid off the road and down an embankment . Joseph Lechuga was apparently killed in the accident . His children , aged 6 and 4 , froze to death . Dolores Lechuga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before she tried dialing for help . <p> Because the family had AirTouch service , the call reached an AirTouch cell site  --  not the transmitter with the strongest signal . The AirTouch site recorded the link , then electronically asked the phone to transfer to a conversation channel . But the signal was n't strong enough to carry talk , so the link was broken . <p> Those records indicate that Dolores Lechuga tried to make six calls  --  and got nothing but dead air . Nightmares Questions about coverage are in the air every day in Atlanta , one of the nation 's best markets for wireless service . <p> More than 30 percent of the area 's residents have wireless phones , according to analysts . That translates to more than 1 million users  --  many moving in and out of coverage every day . For each one who carries a wireless phone and believes that it is a constant electronic lifeline , that notion could too easily turn into a nightmare . <p> For Spielholz , the nightmare grew deeper as she drove , futilely prodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't in a canyon , " she said . " I was n't between tall buildings . I was n't in a garage . I was in a nice residential area , and all I got was dead air . " <p> She figured that the men had seen her leave a shopping mall and wanted to rob her . Or maybe they wanted her BMW 840 . Either way , she did n't want to stop  --  she wanted help . Hampered by other traffic , Spielholz dodged and weaved along a strip of west Los Angeles until their car cut her off . The two men jumped out , one pointing a gun at her . She turned and ducked as two shots were fired . <p> She knew she had been hit . She tried once more calling for help . But now , a bullet had blown apart the wireless phone in her hand  --  along with part of her face . She kept trying to talk , pretending she had police on the line . Her assailants fled . <p> " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shot in the shoulder , " she said . " Then I looked in the mirror and realized I had a hole in my jaw . " <p> She drove her car to an intersection and stopped , hoping to draw attention . She did . From a nearby home , police were called  --  arriving moments later . Since then , she has had 15 surgeries . She has left her job as the globe-trotting senior vice president of MGM . She has been told to limit talking , since it hinders her healing . And she has sued L.A. Cellular , which is 60 percent owned by Atlanta-based BellSouth and 40 percent by AT &T.; <p> Spielholz argues that the company promised seamless coverage over 30,000 square miles of Los Angeles . In the company 's sales pitch , wireless phones were dubbed " the crime fighter of the ' 90s . " Ads made frequent references to safety and peace of mind . <p> " That is why I got the phone and never asked my company to pay for it , " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from Culver City toward Beverly Hills , she was overtaken by the strangers ' car in a section called Beverly Wood  --  well inside the " footprint " of L.A. Cellular coverage . <p> So when she realized her life was in danger , she reached for the phone . <p> " It never occurred to me that I would n't get service , " she said . False-advertising suit Spielholz has filed suit requesting damages for the injury she suffered . That suit is scheduled for trial in the spring . In a separate , class-action suit , she charges L.A. Cellular with false advertising . Other customers who have felt betrayed  --  in less dramatic ways than Spielholz  --  have joined that suit , said Spielholz attorney Jackie Mottek . <p> Before Mottek represented Spielholz , that second suit was dismissed on what Mottek said were procedural grounds . The dismissal , made " without prejudice , " permitted the plaintiff to refile , and she has . <p> There is no controlling precedent , since no similar cases have been litigated . However , the issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may arise , she said . " I think this is just the beginning . " <p> L.A. Cellular officials do not say that the first dismissal of the case undermines its credibility . In fact , they are loath to discuss the Spielholz incident at all  --  or anything relating to the story . <p> " We ca n't comment on any pending legal cases , " said spokesman John Mendez . <p> He declined to discuss L.A. Cellular 's service area in 1994 , how service is marketed or how marketing has changed since 1994 . He declined to talk about the company 's advertising campaigns or even to confirm that the company does advertise . <p> However , the company has added a disclaimer to its ads , a fine-print notice that coverage is not ubiquitous . <p> That 's the way it must be , argued BellSouth 's Feidler . Carriers already spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year expanding their coverage , and there is a limit to how much they can spend , he said . <p> Yes , consumers must be educated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wireless has never had the model of government deciding what people want , what people pay . That is the land-line telephone model , " Feidler said . <p> But Hilliard said the government must consider regulation requiring carriers to complete their coverage areas . <p> He compares it to the laws committing regional Bells to make land-line phone service available to all , including customers in hard-to-serve rural areas . <p> These companies use public airwaves , and early providers like BellSouth were virtually handed spectrum that has been worth billions of dollars . Despite the enormous revenues they reap , carriers are judicious about installing new cellular sites , Hilliard said . <p> " They do studies . If they see a 40 percent return on the investment , then they might do it . It comes down to business . " <p> Powertel executive Mike Bashaw says customers have high expectations .
