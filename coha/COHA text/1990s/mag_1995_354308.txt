1 GOT MILK ? CAMPAIGN Unlike the print ads that force attractive celebrities to don unsightly white mustaches , the series of television spots promoting the joys of milk consumption are gems of sketch comedy . The best has a smug yuppie hit by a truck and beamed to another world replete with yummy cookies and a beckoning refrigerator stocked with milk . Heaven ? Nope , all the containers are empty . Hell . <P> 2 DHL DELIVERY SERVICE Three TV spots for DHL parody advertisers ' fear tactics , as they exaggerate the perils of entrusting foreign-package delivery to no-name operators . One scenario : your parcel ends up in the hands of an aspiring Russian rock star , who holds band practice in his delivery truck and uses the pieces of cargo as drums . <P> 3 NEIMAN MARCUS : " ART OF FASHION " The 28-page spread appeared in magazines to promote the Chanels , Armanis and Pradas available at Neiman 's . Fashion advertising is rarely this conceptual or dark . In brilliantly composed photographs , the ad lays out a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than life , literally towering over buildings and people . Pity her fate , though : she winds up a storefront mannequin . <P> 4 LEVI 'S 501S : " PRAGUE " This black-and-white TV spot is as artfully shot as it is wittily scripted . A hip ex-pat putters about the city in a tiny old auto only to emerge in his boxers . Where are his 501 jeans ? " In Prague , " he declares , " you can trade them for a car . " <P> 5 PIONEER CAR STEREOS The conceit is amusingly elaborate . A five-ad print campaign titled " The Road-Kill Diaries " notes the afterlife insights of critters flattened by automobiles with distractingly good sound systems . Sample entry : " Spent the morning burrowing . Heard the sound of some powerful amps . Should 've looked both ways . " <P> 6 TAGHEUER SPORTS WATCHES A series of surreal , seamlessly edited images makes this black-and-white TV spot unforgettably stylish . The ad , free of a voiceover , interprets the mind games athletes play to muster their drive . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a course full of vases and , in the finale , an equestrian and her horse traverse the roofs of skyscrapers . <P> 7 ESPN SPORTS CENTER Taken together , these 15 TV spots promoting the sports-news show function as a mock documentary , offering a hilarious behind-the-scenes look at Sports Center . Fittingly , Spinal Tap 's David St. Hubbins ( Michael McKean ) appears in two of the ads as the composer of the program 's theme music . <P> 8 MERCEDES BENZ VIA JANIS JOPLIN Sure , sure , it prostitutes the spirit of the 1960s , but the finest car ad of late achieves perfect-pitch simplicity . A new model E-class coasts toward us on the TV screen . The only sound we hear is Joplin belting her classic Mercedes Benz . <P> 9 KEDS When was the last time salesmanship seemed touching ? Aimed at young women , this TV ad tastefully evokes a nostalgia for girlhood while successfully repositioning Keds as acceptable grownup footwear . As women of all ages frolic in slow motion , a narrator asks , " What size Keds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was the prettiest woman on earth ? ... What size Keds will you be wearing when a woman walks on Mars ? "
