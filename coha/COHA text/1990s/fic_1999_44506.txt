I , DERRIK RAMSDEN , DO NOT rattle easily . So when old pal Vreedon emptied my bank accounts , leaving me exactly $8.73 , did I weep ? Did I moan ? <p> Hardly . <p> I did , however , contact two junkies , give them his address , and tell them that he had five and a half pounds of crack hidden someplace in his apartment . Vreedon , however , is no sloth . He moved too fast for them ; he had already vanished , and the junkies , pathetic skinks , got six months for trying to steal the doors and plumbing fixtures . <p> A month before , Vreedon had told me , " C'm on Ramsden , I need investment capital and I know from hacking around that you 've got $9,000 stuck in miserable savings at something like 2.1% . This is heavily big . This is , in short , a deal !

This one , my friend , is a sure thing , and since we 've known each other longer than we 've known anyone but family , I came to you . You , of all people , I came to . You , who live like a roach in this dump . I thought you 'd like the chance to move up . Have , you know , like heating , like when you worked at Madame Helga 's . " <p> His reference to that singular blot on my employment history was gratuitous and not appreciated . " You have five or six sure things a year , Vreedon , and you 're still riding the bus . So what 's so majorly big about this one ? " <p> " Trust me . The less you know about it , the better . But the return will be a hundred to one . You give me your $9,000 - a month later , I give you $900,000 , minimum .

It made me ask annoying questions about the purpose of life and how to more deeply screw the relatives of the dead . It was immoral , but it was legal . The $9,000 I 'd saved plus another year 's savings was supposed to be my ticket out of this roach motel . <p> " No deal , Vreedon . It 's too good to be true , however illegal it is . " <p> He lurched forward and sat on the edge of the sofa . " Have I ever screwed you on a deal , Ram ? " <p> " Not since the business with the Hitler sex video , no . " <p> " Jeez . You got no spirit of adventure , Ramsden . " <p> " Right . Poverty ate it . " <p> My next bank statement indicated a total balance of $8.73 . He even emptied my checking account . <p> However , a month later , a package with a lot of strapping tape around it arrived with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Inside , in crude bundles of well-used twenties , fifties , and hundreds , I found $915,200 . First I was robbed , then I was rich . It took days to sink in . I kept opening the box and studying the bills . <p> I , Derrik Ramsden , no longer had to look for angles . I could have a life just like before I was disbarred . I was rich . <p> So I moved into a house with coherent walls , actual electrical wiring , and water that came from faucets instead of a garden hose stuck through the kitchen window . And I re-hired the one surviving junkie for my houseboy as soon as the Honor Farm released him . His deceased partner , during a religious seizure , had boiled a Bible to get the ink off the pages and had then mainlined the distillate in order to get closer to God , which he did . <p> Cleetis worked furiously at whatever he did , his little crewcut blond halfwit head devoid of the slightest thought , and he worked for practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two-room cottage he lived in behind the house . <p> Life was good . Life was wonderful . <p> I even had enough life in me to put a few lightweight moves on one Vera Kamchatka , high-school nurse and part-time real estate agent who 'd sold me the house . <p> Then , one morning , there were three dead spots in the front lawn . <p> " Cleetis ! You take a leak on the grass ? " <p> " No boss ! Nuh-uh . Not me . I 'm a clean guy . I like white porcelain , boss . " <p> " So what 's the deal ? " <p> True to form , Cleetis rushed to the front yard and on his hands and knees began poking , smelling , and prodding the dead grass , the little brain in his blond head popping along full speed on a cylinder and a half . <p> " Burn spot , boss ! Done been burned . " He stood up and wiped his hands on his pants . " Wumme reseed it ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now , boss ? Get some seed and- " <p> " I want you to keep an eye on the front yard tonight . You can - " <p> " I get a lawn chair , stay outta sight , they come back , I tap-dance on their jewels , boss , you better believe it , that 's right . " <p> " Right , right . You ever sleep Cleetis ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> About five that afternoon , Vera Kamchatka called to tell me she 'd rented my old house , the roach breeding colony . <p> " What ? Why ? Vera , the deal was to leave it empty a month and see if someone would bum it down - remember ? You 're in real estate , you 're supposed to understand these things . " <p> " There was a good reason . We need to talk about it . " When she spoke , I could visualize those legs of hers , coming out of her body about three feet below her voice . <p> " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unresolved fears that the IRS is going to ask how I can afford to live in this house , a houseboy who , at this very moment , is out screaming at dogs or something in the front yard , and I need simplicity , Vera , not to be a liable landlord responsible for some human being living in that trap . I could be sued . " <p> Her voice lowered . " Ramsden , I need to talk to you . There have been anomalous occurrences . " <p> I loved it when she talked to me like that . <p> Still , from the front yard , Cleetis 's shrill voice whooped and yapped incoherently . <p> Enough was enough . I 'd fire the half-wit . I did n't need any more strangeness in my life . He kept the place clean but I did n't need someone who stood in the front yard and screamed . <p> " Vera , I need to go see if Cleetis has hurt himself or if he 's just longing for the old days . " <p> " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seven o'clock . " <p> Visions danced in my head . Vera stood an even six feet tall and in her real estate clothes looked like a Detroit parole officer-hair back in a tight black bun , eyes the color of frozen slag , and her thin lips the color of an aluminized rose . <p> " I 'll be th- " <p> " Boss ! ' Cleetis exploded into the room in a flurry of waving arms , fast breathing , rolling eyes , and a spew of incoherence. " ... outside ! ... yard ! ... whoof ! ... jesus ! You got ta get out here ! " <p> " Bye , Vera . I 'll bring wine . " <p> A dozen steps out the front door , I saw her . A petite dark-skinned woman , standing on my lawn , holding a small bouquet of gardenias in her two hands . She had on some kind of brightly colored wraparound sarong . <p> " Jesus , another one ! " Cleetis screamed , grabbing his face as though it might peel off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reedy voice . <p> " Look out , boss ! Stay back ! Do n't let her get close to you ! " <p> " Yeah , I 'm Ramsden . " I could n't figure why Cleetis was going moron on me . The little kid probably weighed all of ninety-five pounds . <p> In the slowly gathering gloom of the fall evening , I saw her grin broadly , her teeth very white with a few gold fillings . " A flower for you , sir . " She picked out one of the gardenias and tossed it toward me . <p> Then little wisps of white smoke started trailing out of her hair and out of the folds of her ankle-length wraparound skirt . <p> " Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! " Cleetis screamed at her . " Stop ! Do n't do it ! " <p> " Cleetis , what's- " <p> " Stay back , boss ! Stay back ! She 's gon na whoof on us ! " <p> " Goo'bye , Misser Ramsden , goo'bye . " Small tongues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold teeth glittered in the flames . " Goo'bye , Misser Ramsden . " <p> The next instant , her fire billowed out of her clothes and her hair flashburned with a sudden whoof . <p> I , Derrik Ramsden , do not rattle easily , but neither have I ever seen a person self-combust . <p> I lunged for the garden hose , turned the valve , and when I turned back to spray her , she had vanished . <p> Dark billows of smoke rolled up into the darker sky . No ashes even . And on my lawn was a fifth burn hole . <p> And one uncharted gardenia . <p> CLEETIS RAVED for a few minutes till I hosed him down . He became marginally sober . " Go clean up . When you stop gibbering , we 're going to Vera 's . " <p> " Uuuuh .... uuuuh " <p> As an exemplary shallow person Cleetis 's emotions run with equivalent depth . Fifteen minutes later he came back out , his little driver 's cap on , tossing the car keys in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we 're out , boss . " <p> I got in the back seat of the Buick and decided to stop thinking . Vera would distract me . <p> " Here , boss , this make you feel better . " He slipped a cassette of country and western music into the player . Two chords into " Lick My Chops " I threatened to report his three parole violations I 'd kept track of , and he turned it off . <p> I do not sympathize with suffering cowboys . <p> " Ramsden ! You 're early . And very pale . " " A woman just combusted in my front yard , " I said sullenly . <p> " Two of ' em , " Cleetis corrected . " Went up whoof , just like that . " <p> I looked at him . <p> " I 'll wait in the car , " he said . <p> Inside , Vera snuggled up to me as much as a six-foot woman can to a guy who 's five-ten . She 'd taken off her real estate uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue-black with a high black embroidered collar . She wrapped her arms around me and breathed in my ear , " Patience dear . Would you like a drink to take the edge off ? You do smell a bit smoky , " she said . <p> " Vera , a woman went up in flames in my front yard . " <p> She planted a swift kiss on my sun-cracked lips and left for the kitchen . " I have just what you need . Something without subtlety . " <p> Along with selling houses , Vera was the nurse at a place she referred to as Hormonal High . Her background was nearly as Byzantine as my own . Her degrees were in DNA protein synthesis , but once upon a time she had accepted a job at the infamous Ortho-Nuclear Chemical Dynamics Corporation and been given a fabulous salary . But when a certain presidential candidate was in the death-throes of his campaign and needed a public service scandal to boost his ratings , he revealed the story of Ortho-Nuke 's " Project Frankenstein " and Vera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandaging bite-wounds on juveniles . <p> I flopped on her black leather sofa . This evening , what with having witnessed a death by fire , it was hard to focus on that which stood before my eyes - the semi-transparent silk poncho she wore and her loose hair that seemed to fly around her head like weather patterns . <p> Money was supposed to make life make sense , not make me mental . <p> " You rented my old house to someone , " I called to her . " I was hoping the neighborhood kids would burn it down . Only way I 'll get any money out of it . " <p> She came out of the kitchen with a huge goblet half filled with pale green slush . A sheet of paper covered the top and she carried it very carefully . <p> " Here . " She held it under my nose and slid off the paper . " Breathe deeply . " <p> I did . <p> Everything changed . The world brightened . My cares became less world shaking . I even managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the blue-black thing she wore was the only thing she wore . <p> " Gee , " I said . <p> " Nice cold nitrous oxide hovering over vodka-lime slush . Feel better now ? " <p> " Yeah .. . I could watch people spontaneously combust all day . Okay , " I said , " what is it you said we need to talk about ? I assume it 's bad news . What 's the worst news you can give me ? Do it before this wears off . " <p> She sat beside me and laid her long fingers along the side of my neck . " A few weeks after you bought the new house , something unusual happened at school . We have a fundamentalist science teacher there named Zick . He was having his kids do individual science projects , and one of his Lao-Haitian kids brought in his grandfather as his project . " <p> I took a few deep breaths of clean air . There seemed to be several serious non sequiturs in what she was telling me . A fundamentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking a lot , " she said . <p> " I 'm all right . Speak more . If it does n't all come together in a minute , I 'll let you know . " <p> " Well , in his own brand of English , the old man started telling them that there was a new disease starting right here in Santa Miranda and that soon it would affect nearly everyone with some very bad consequences . Zick apparently liked this news since it fit in with several Biblical verses he always recites about the end of the world . " <p> " Vera , although you have amazing legs , you 're making the world seem very complex right now . " <p> " I know , dear . Keep your random access memory alive a minute longer . " She recrossed her legs . I 'd never seen past her knees before . She had great muscles in there . " As soon as the old guy told them that it was sexually transmitted - and I gather he did this with some kind of Laotian hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling . Now this last part I do n't know what to make of , but it was enough to cause Zick to evacuate his class and to call the police . Are you hyperventilating ? " <p> " He did what in his class ? " <p> " He evacuated his class , he did n't evacuate in class . " <p> I was relieved , although the post-digestive image remained in my mind . <p> " But what evidently drove Zick over the edge was that the old man kept saying , ' reality fucks generators . ' Over and over . Zick could n't shut him up , so he called the police . " <p> One of her unrestrained breasts , I suddenly realized , was resting on the back of my hand . Heavily resting on the back of my hand . With only an eighth of a millimeter of fabric between me and her actual warm breasticular flesh . <p> " Vera , " I said , " My concentration is n't what it was two minutes ago . Before I pass out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do with me ? Why are you tormenting me with this story ? " <p> " I must 've got too much nitrous in your glass . " She moved closer and rested one hand on the back of my neck . The breast remained on my hand . <p> " I 'm telling you this , " she said soothingly , " because when the police came , he said his head hurt and asked for the nurse . ' And when he saw me , he smiled , bowed politely , said he felt fine , and asked if he could rent your house . Also , five or six times , he said Mr. Ramden come see me , get to keep money . ' His name is Khamphang LaNuit-Gomez . " <p> That brought me around . I even forgot what was on my hand . " Keep my money ? And he knew my name ? And asked to rent my house ? It 's got to be the Internal Revenue Service . They found out somehow . Vreedon squealed - it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is despicable . They probably offered this Fang person a job at a taco stand if he 'd pull this stunt . " My vision began going grainy around the edges . <p> For the first month in four years I did n't have to eat macaroni and beans six times a week , and now , whatever else all this meant , it meant I was involved , and I did n't want to be involved with anything where people burned up and talked about my money and the police asked questions . <p> " Well , " she said , " given my experience in the federal sector , your paranoia may not be unwise . However , with his knowing you and his implied threat to your money , I thought I should rent it to him for a couple of months . And this disease thing is something he should n't have known about . " Her voice turned dark and low . " It 's very ominous , Derrik . " <p> For the second time in a single minute , my blood ran cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetically . " STS , dear . Neither one of us has it , but as another in the long series of sexually transmitted diseases that are turning up , it 's ominously fascinating . The best guess is that it causes microscopic lesions in the prefrontal cortex and perhaps a subtle but widespread deterioration of the limbic system . Probably a virus . It - " <p> " I have it , do n't I. This is why you gave me this drink and why you 're telling me this complicated story , to confuse me - so I 'll think I 'm okay till I wake up in the morning and it all sinks in . Go ahead and say it . I get a little money and two months later , I 'm going to die . " <p> " No , dear . " <p> She wrapped her nurse-realtor 's hands around my face , turned me to face her , and gave me a kiss that rearranged my priorities ... lips and the touch of-her tongue across my teeth ... it felt like god had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a transmissible disease , Mr. Ramsden . " <p> " I 've been celibate for a year and a half , " I said truthfully . " By choice , " I lied . <p> " Yummy , " she said . Then she shifted gears . " The Atlanta Centers for Disease Control already have two people here and others across the state - very quietly , of course-and they 're officially calling it STPL . Sexually transmitted pre-frontal lesions . But unofficially they 're calling it STS sexually transmitted stupidity , and it 's no joke . It 's one of those very mean viruses that evidently popped up out of nowhere , and the biggest problem they 're going to have , when they have to announce it to the public , is to convince them that it 's real After all , stupid people are the hardest ones to convince that they 're stupid . " <p> " STS ? " <p> Her hair swirled when she nodded . <p> " How stupid does it make a person ? " <p> " Some of the teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going where one by one they pretend to forget how to read anything over about fourth grade level . " <p> " What are they complaining for ? That 's enough to graduate , is n't it ? " <p> " To get out of high school they have to read at fifth grade level . It could cost the school a lot of money - and cause a reevaluation of the staff . Outside school , in the real world , all you have to do is pick up the paper . " <p> She leaned over the arm of the sofa and pulled a sheaf of newspaper from under an end table . <p> " ' Burglar Caught Napping  --  Beaten Into Coma . ' He broke into a house with the apparent intention of stealing the refrigerator shelves but stopped to eat and went to sleep on the sofa . The owner came back and nearly killed him . Owner 's in jail now . " She turned a page . " Teen Gives Birth In Class , Thinks Baby Alien Parasite . ' After it was explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became quite maternal . " <p> " You think these people are stupid ? They sound like degree candidates to me . " <p> She raised an eyebrow at me . " Okay . How about this . " She pulled out a half-size section of newsprint . " What 's Hot , What 's Not . ' It 's part of a teen-oriented insert the paper does . You might need something to bite on for this one . " <p> " I 've lived with insects , remember . " <p> " According to this , branding is hot . ' As a gesture of bonding , young adults now use soldering irons and decorative branding irons to mark each other at branding parties . Popular patterns include pitchforks , flames , hamburgers , and the Nike swoosh . " ' She smiled . " They do it on tender parts . " <p> I felt my nostrils involuntarily flare . But what the hell . Kids will be kids . <p> " What 's also hot-self-surgery . ' Popular operations include removing the last joint of the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved one to wear around the neck . ' You 'll appreciate this one : ' And what could be more intimate than a sealed jewel of your loved one 's intestinal effluent inserted sub-cutaneously between the eyebrows ? " ' <p> " That 's hideous ! Even Cleetis would be repelled . " <p> " That 's fashion . Also what 's hot - cranial transducers . " I must have looked blank . <p> " Sixteen kids in my health classes have cranial transducers . They jack their CD players right into this thing that 's screwed into their skull . Makes their skulls vibrate . They say the bass is excellent After a few hundred hours of that , they need friends to wipe their chins . That 's STS . " <p> The whole thing gave me the creeps-self-mutilation as a party sport , purposeful brain damage - but why should I care ? Teenagers are famous for annoying their elders . She read my mind . <p> " You should care , Derrik , because Khamphang LaNuit-Gomez has your number . Khamphang both knew about STS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name . He knows something about your money , which I , fortunately , do not know about . Put that together with the burning woman in your yard , and I 'd say you have an interesting situation developing . " <p> " There 's only one thing to do , " I said , " and that 's to get my hands on this Fang person and find out who put him up to it . " <p> " After school tomorrow , I 'll go with you . I 'd like to know what he meant by reality fucks generators . " ' <p> " I 'm not going to wait till tomorrow-I 'm going now . He 's probably in bed , sleeping like a child , and if there 's one thing I 've learned in life , if you want to get a straight answer , catch them with their pants down . It 's harder to lie when you 're naked , except when you 're sexually aroused . " <p> " In point of fact , Mr. Ramsden , you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing energizes me like the search for truth . " I stood up and got to the door . " I 'll sleep tomorrow , " I said heroically . <p> She followed me to her front step . Out in the car I could hear country music playing softly . <p> " Actually , " I said to her , " I feel like a piece of flank steak . But it 's hard to get to sleep when somebody 's about to pull your plug . " <p> " So well I know . " <p> I went down the walk and looked back once as I got in the back seat of the car . i could dream about those legs later . <p> Cleetis turned off the car lights and we coasted to a stop in front of the dump where I used to live . The neighborhood was a mix of the three races and nine or ten nationalities . The kids all played together during the day , but at night the older ones came out to rob and stomp anyone with an accent different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were locked like vaults and the street was dark except for a few windows dimly lit by low  --  wattage bulbs . <p> " Bet you glad you do n't live here nomore , " Cleetis whispered . " You gon na roust this old guy ? You want me to help ? I could go screamin ' at the back door- " <p> I studied the dark front of the house , but nothing looked unusual " Two things , Cleetis . First , stay in the car . Second , no music . Keep your ears open . " <p> " You think this old guy has a gun ? " <p> " Who knows . He may be in there with a houseful of flamers . " I got out of the car while Cleetis breathed heavily . <p> " I do n't want nothing to do with no flamers , boss . They unnerve me . " <p> " Pretend it 's lights-out on the cell block , Cleetis . Watch for creepers . " <p> He shuddered as I left him . <p> The front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blew through the house smelled like seaweed . I drew back my hand to knock and the porch light next to my face flared like a runway beacon . <p> " Herrow , Mr. Ramden , " said a shadowy face on the other side of the screen . " Make self inside . " He turned on a ceiling light and pushed the screen open . " I have expected you . " <p> Khamphang LaNuit-Gomez was old , sunken-chested , and had a neat rim of bristly white hair around his head . He wore a clean white T-shirt , baggy faded blue pants , and rubber thongs . The living room had three things in it arranged in a triangle : a thrift-shop sofa , a portable TV on the floor , and a wooden kitchen chair . He gestured politely to the chair . He sat in the middle of his earthtone houndstooth sofa and looked like a stick  --  man with his ankles crossed , his clasped hands between his knees , and a big smile on his crinkly face . " So nice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wires or unusual attachments on the kitchen chair , so I sat down . We stared at each other a few seconds . I wanted to make the old guy uneasy , but it was n't working . He grinned and nodded to me . <p> " You may ask first question , " he said . <p> " Do you work for the IRS ? " <p> " No , " he said crisply . <p> " Who do you work for ? " <p> " Want to work for you . " <p> I noted that he did n't answer the question . " Well , " I said , " I probably could use some help fixing up the burn holes in my yard . Next question : Why did the woman bum up in front of me today ? " <p> " Because to make you pay attention . I want to see you soon , Mr. Ramden . We have very interesting problem . You can help . " <p> " You burned up this woman so I would come here ? Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call . You think because I 'm a landlord I do n't have compassion ? That I do n't have feelings ? If you wanted to make an impression , you could 've sent flowers or a few good stock tips . " <p> " Did n't kill woman , " he said . " Those fire people , you not really see what you think you see . We wanted to make big impression . " <p> " So I 'm impressed enough to be here . Speak . " <p> " There a problem with reality fucks generators . " <p> " Really . Well , reality does that to all of us every now and then . Look , Fang , I can appreciate your having hard times , but if you want to get your rent reduced , double-talk wo n't help . And if you keep turning people into charcoal briquettes , or whatever the hell it is you 're doing , you could find yourself back in Port-au-Prince providing a little entertainment for the ton-ton police . " <p> He looked worried . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was up and back into the kitchen before I could stop him . For an old man , he moved fast . I positioned myself by the door in case he returned with armaments . <p> He came back holding one of those ninety-five cent Wal-Mart dictionaries , thumbing through it as he went back to the sofa . <p> " Here , " he said , pointing to a word . " Look . Reality fucks generators . " <p> I leaned over to look at the extended book and the word he pointed to was flux . <p> " Reality flux generators ? " I asked . <p> His face lit up . " Jess ! " he said , nodding vigorously . <p> I was getting the feeling that rent reduction was n't on his mind . I had been hoping for something simple for a change , fool that I was . <p> I took a deep breath . " Okay , Fang , what is a reality flux generator ? " " It be what we want you to rejust for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly , " he said pleasantly , his eyebrows raised , " and sometimes , generators mess up , need be rejusted . All things attach to all things . Generator in center of .... " He searched for a word , then his face lit up . " Generator in center of center . When generator go out on whack , bad things happen , you know ? Like people get disease , go nuts . You like a beer , Mr. Ramden ? " <p> " Certainly , Mr. Fang . " <p> Deciding to humor him , while he was in the kitchen , I called out , " So why do n't you get yourself a wrench and adjust these things yourself ? " <p> " Not able , " he said , coming back into the room with a couple of Sun Lik beers for us . " I- " <p> There was a crash through the side window right next to me , glass sprayed across the floor , and a rock glumped on the floor with a piece of paper duct-taped to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . <p> " Neighbors , " he said . He handed me the rock and said , " You read . " <p> I peeled off the tape . The note looked like it had been written by someone who held his crayon like a butter knife . It said , " Gokes go bake were you cam frome ! ! ! " but I did n't read it aloud . <p> " Do n't have to tell me . I know what it say , " he said . " See ? People get stupid more faster . Stupid sex sickness go person to person - two then four then eight , then everybody . Nobody help nobody , people do bad stuff all over , first kill Kampuchea , Rwanda , Serbia , kill whole world - all because of stupid sickness go person to person jiggy-jig . " He made a Lao  --  Haitian hand-gesture that looked pretty universal to me . " Mr. Ramden must fix generators . " <p> " Go fix these reality flux generators yourself , Fang . Why me ? A wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . " <p> " You fix , " he said , giving me a dismissive wave of his hand and taking a long pull from his beer . " I too old . Beside , I do n't have car . " He grinned and pointed a gnarled finger at me . " I know you , Mr. Ramden . You sold tombstone to family , say spirits must be held down by big stone - cost much much money . But then you come back next day and give half money back . You crazy white guy . Heh-heh ! Good crazy , Mr. Ramden . " <p> " If it 's any comfort to you , Fang , I came back the next day to sell you another one - but you were gone and I did n't think the little kid you left behind could close the deal . " My professional training allowed me to lie like a teenager . <p> Fang shook his head and chuckled . Why was I losing this one so fast ? <p> I swilled off the Sun Lik . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality 's been fine till your friends started wrecking my lawn . Thanks for the beer . " <p> He thumbed madly through his dictionary and pointed to another word . <p> " Monitor , " I read . <p> " Yes . " He did his grin again . " Monitor . Khamphang is monitor . " <p> " And what does that mean ? " <p> " Mean Khamphang responsible for fucks generators here . You fix them , sickness go away . " <p> " Thanks for the beer , Fang . " I stood up . " I 'll have the window fixed . In the meantime , I 'll call you sometime . We can do lunch . Later . " <p> I did n't even wait to see the expression on his face . The guy had been up late a lot of nights to dream up that one . If he was n't with the IRS , he was probably involved in some kind of rent scam invented in a Phnom Penh basement . <p> Once I got to the car , I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleetis ? " <p> He climbed up out of the floor of the front seat . " Are they gone , boss ? " " You mean Fang 's friends who threw the rock through the window ? <p> Yeah , they 're gone . " <p> " Those were n't no friends , boss . Those was six guys in ski masks carrying ax handles . " <p> " Let 's go home , Cleetis . " <p> " God damn right , boss . " <p> We lost about 15,000 miles of rubber by the time we got there . In the moonlight except for the dead spots , my new home , complete with water and electricity , looked wonderful . And sane . <p> Inside , I fell across the bed with my clothes on and was asleep by the second bounce . <p> Somebody talked to me . I had been dreaming Vera 's legs wrapping around me , but somewhere now , a voice talked to me . <p> " ... so the question of the hour is , ' How did Socrates know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know the answer to that brain twister , so call in if you know the answer because one of our listeners is real puzzled ! Hey , am I supposed to know everything ? Am I Eisenstein ? Give us a call , gang . " I faded out and faded back in to hear the same voice talking about a NASA probe that had landed on the outskirts of Heaven and brought back voodoo germs which would cause worldwide attention deficit disorder . <p> When I finally got my eyes open , I saw it was my radio talking to me , so I hit the button on top to keep from being more depressed about the human condition than I already was . Money gave you time to brood about things like that . <p> I had a few cups of coffee at the kitchen table and went through the mail while Cleetis scrubbed the tile grout on the drain board with a toothbrush . He wore his cassette player and earphones while he worked , but I could still hear the dismal moan of his suffering cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers and other large animals . If this STS thing was real , Cleetis must have dipped in at the source ... an ugly thought . <p> The mail was typical ... except for a postcard with a picture of wheat fields on the front side . On the back , down at the bottom , it was signed by Vreedon . That gink . <p> The writing was microscopic . I started at the top . <p> Dear Ramsden , <p> Well , it finally happened . I never even got to my plane . I had the cargo in my car trunk , and all of a sudden , this Fed lays his bazooka through my window and says , " Howdy . " All in all , it might be for the best . How was I to know that stuff in the boxes was n't Gatorade ? I thought they were paying quite a lot just for transportation , but I figured what the hell , soldiers down in Paraguay get thirsty too . However , if I 'd landed too hard , they 'd been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flown in DC-3 's with bad suspension . Nobody tells me anything . A good thing you did n't invest . Uncle took everything , plane , bucks , everything . See you in six months . ( I had a good lawyer . ) New add : #41-82-0503 , Box 42346 , Leavenworth , KS . Yrs . Vreedon <p> I swallowed hard . Vreedon never got off the ground ? Vreedon never took my savings ? Vreedon was in Leavenworth ? <p> I roused Cleetis from his grout and told him to go scrub the spots on the driveway . While he was in front , I got a shovel and dug up one of the boxes in the garden where I kept a major chunk of the cash . <p> Guess what . <p> It was n't there . <p> The three thousand bucks of mad money I had taped under the sink - gone . The inch of 50s inside the radio - gone . I was about to pull up the carpet in the bedroom where I 'd hidden a layer of I OOs when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I really did n't want to see that black-haired kid , eighteen or nineteen years old , standing there with a shy grin on his face , one finger in his mouth and a scraggly bouquet of gardenias in the crook of his other arm . <p> Cleetis yelled at him , " G'won ! Scram ! My god it 's another one ! We do n't want nothing . Boss ! Go ' way ! Boss ! " <p> The kid just stood there . <p> I figured what the hell . I had to go outside sooner or later , so I stepped out on the porch . <p> Just like I 'd touched a match to him , he started to smoke . His Hawaiian shirt crinkled up , turned a light brown and flash-burned . <p> " Howdy , goo'bye , " the kid said with that same weird grin as the woman the night before . He tossed a gardenia in my direction and it landed smoldering on the lawn . Cleetis looked at me with mad-dog terror in his eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to his body he burned a yellow-white and was surrounded by a flickering orange aura . <p> " You 'd better get out of the way , Cleetis . " I could feel the heat from where I stood . <p> Then the kid whoofed off like a hundred pounds of loosely wrapped black powder . Billows of gray smoke swooshed over the front porch , the yard , the car , and Cleetis . <p> When the breeze finally carried it away , I saw Cleetis standing there on the edge of the drive , staring at the new burn hole in the lawn . Now there were six dead spots in the yard . He looked up at me in open-mouthed wonder . <p> No ashes , and one smoldering gardenia . <p> " Better buy a big bag of grass seed while we 're out today , " I said . " And we need to go see that new tenant again . " <p> As I stepped back inside the house , I realized I was in my underwear . These were not amateurs I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants off . <p> AS WE DROVE deeper into the slum sections , I could n't help but notice that a lot of people were milling around for that time of day . Despite the very warm moming , a lot of them seemed to be wearing shorts with overcoats . Poor fashion sense did not seem to be the reason . <p> " These people , " Cleetis called back over his shoulder , " they make me uneasy . They got instruments of havoc under them coats , boss , you can count on it " <p> " Just keep the windows up and the motor running at all times . " <p> " Yo boss . " <p> When I was in college I wrote a paper on the inverse relationship between ambient temperature and intelligence - up to 102 , the hotter it gets , the more people act like hitleroids , and all those lumpy overcoats on a day like this did not bode for happy times . We still had a few minutes before we got to Fang 's , so I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sexy as I remembered . <p> " Cleetis , gim me the phone . " <p> " Atlanta CDC sent in six more people last night on a charter plane , " she said . " Two are in Sacramento , two in Merced , and two more here in Santa Miranda . Significant populations as far away as Denver are starting to act up - and probably in LA , although aside from the increase in freeway killings , it 's hard to tell down there . Where are you calling from ? " <p> " The Buick . I 'm on my way to Fang 's . We 've been passing a lot of mugger-types standing around with ax handles and motorcycle chains hanging out the bottoms of their overcoats . Maybe your Atlanta people are on to something . " <p> ' I thought you saw Khamphang last night . " <p> " I did . We got nowhere . This guy 's been on Mars too long . " Cleetis suddenly swerved to miss some guy who had stopped in the middle of the street to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What was all that swearing ? " Vera asked . <p> " Never mind . We 're under control now . I have to go - we 're almost there . " <p> " Listen , " she said . " It still troubles me that Khamphang knew about STS - very few people have that information - and he knew . Do n't take this guy lightly . " <p> " Do n't worry . " <p> I opened the rear-seat glove box and poured myself a drink of Acceler  --  Oh ! from the thermos-a completely legal synaptic transport enhancer , prescribed for me by one of the finest pharmacists in Tijuana . I had n't been getting a lot of restful sleep lately , and there was an off-chance Fang might try doing a " Howdy , goo'bye " on me if I did n't participate in his psychotic notions about " reality flux generators . " In a closed room I wanted to be able to respond with great rapidity . If I was lucky , the house would go up in flames along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance . <p> This Fang person had wanted my attention , and now he was going to get it - Derrik Ramsden , moving quickly , mind like teal strap . <p> " Be inside , " he said graciously . " Welcome , Mr. Ramden . You come to just reality generators this morning ? " He bowed and nodded his little white-bristled head like I was a wonderful person . <p> The place smelled funny . On top of the odor of fish was something else . I looked around . Yes , on top of the odor of fish was the odor of burned curtains . <p> " What happened ? " <p> " Gentlemen returned after throwing rock and threw fire into curtain . " <p> " You may have to wait for me to get them fixed , " I said . " That 's a special-order item and costs measurable money , which is something I seem to be without at the moment . Get my drift ? Comprendo ? " <p> " Si , yes . Money gone from all hiding places . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money back , Fang . " <p> " Our money , " Fang said . " Get back very easy . " <p> I was starting to feel like a stray dog who 'd been coaxed into the gas chamber . If this guy was n't working for the IRS , he had read their manuals . <p> " Your money ? " I said stupidly . <p> " We let you enjoy it a while , then take away . Make you hungry , huh . " <p> " You set up Vreedon in this , did n't you ? He 's in prison because you set us both up . " <p> " Oh yes , but get out soon , with your help . He get good lawyer . Or you sell tombstone again to welfare people . Neighbor across street about to die , " he added idly . " Could be first sale of new life . " <p> I gazed past him out the window . It was such a pretty day , the sun rose mindlessly through the trees , the birds sang their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's young , the muggers strolled peaceably through the streets , waiting for the temperature to go up . And I was looking at a major lifestyle demotion . <p> " Okay , Fang , " I said , snapping my mind back to what currently seemed like the real world . I sat down . I figured I should say something tough . " Who do you want me turn into chunk style ? " <p> " Ah , " he said , giving me his big squinty smile . " No one need to be messed up . Only need you to ' just reality generators . Very easy . No sweat . Piece of nice cake . Without ' justment , people get very very bad stupid . Then .... " He shrugged up his shoulders and flipped his hands outward . The gesture for hopelessness was apparently the same in both our cultures . <p> I nodded my head and tried to keep the desolation out of my voice . " I do this and you get Vreedon out and my money .. your money reappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very easy . Take maybe hour only . " <p> " Fine . How about one of those Sun Liks while you tell me about it . " <p> You know those dreams where you 're standing in your living room , say , petting a dog ... and then the dog turns into an ex-wife that tries to chew the face off your head ? You know it 's impossible , but there it is . It ca n't be , but it 's happening anyway , and if you do n't believe it , a full set of teeth is going to snag the eyes right out of your face . <p> That 's what was happening to me . After being disbarred , I had always thought there were limits to the lunacy I would get involved in . The sun also rises , but the wangers are out there twenty-four hours a day . <p> Everything is connected to everything else , he said . And at vital points there are these reality flux generators which were disguised as ordinary objects . These generators , Fang said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generations ago his people had been chosen to monitor the things , to try to keep reality running smoothly . <p> That 's what he said . He had my money , so who was I to argue ? His were a chosen people , he said . His people , he said . Lao-Haitians ? I asked . Well , not exactly , he said . They were from a lot of places , but ... well ... they were n't really what you 'd call Lao-Haitians . Martians , I suggested . Well ... not really . <p> These generators , he said , control the way things happen . They " went out on whack " in Cambodia , he said with a smile , and they could n't get people to adjust them in the right way at the right time , so his country turned into a mausoleum janitored by Khmer Rouge thrill-killers . Now , he said , the generators here are going out on whack here and would I please help . <p> Certainly I would , I told him , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . <p> " No , no , not eight hunderd thousand , " he said , causing my blood to run cold . " With quick investment , now million three . " <p> My blood warmed quickly . He had my money , after all , and if he could put Vreedon in Leavenworth as a hostage , the man was not to be abused . <p> " I 'm all ears . " <p> " Generators disguised as ordinary things , " he said . " Big one near here look like old car in field , over by school , Madison and Spruce Streets . " <p> " So , what am I supposed to do ? " <p> " Move old car . " <p> " And that 's going to make this stupid disease go away , I 'll get the money back , and Vreedon gets out of Leavenworth ? " <p> " Yes true . " <p> " Anybody could do this , Fang . Why me ? It 's too easy . There has to be booby trap here . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're crazy . " <p> " Had to be someone . Today , it be you . And you very poor , Mr. Ramden . " <p> Fang had an intimate understanding of fate and human motivation . <p> CLEETIS TWITCHED morbidly , but he promised to do what I said . I did n't see any reason to smother the poor man with details , so I just told him we were going to do some precision car-ramming . The destructive aspect cheered him up a little , but when he heard the location , he became abject . <p> On our way over to the junked car , I called Vera to listen to her voice again <p> " Listen , " she said , " we may have bad problems soon . The Lieutenant Governor has just been on television talking about how mediocre citizens are not fully represented in government . He wants to establish a department of mediocrity . " <p> " Can he even spell it ? " <p> " He 's going to call it the Department of Ordinary People-DOPe . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take questions from women in black hose with a seam up the back . " <p> " Vera , I 've got business to attend to . You may not believe this , but I suspect aliens disguised as Lao-Haitians have robbed me blind and sent Vreedon to Leavenworth . " <p> There was a long pause . " You should come in to the clinic for a blood workup when you have time . " <p> " I 'm serious . " <p> " It 's sexually transmitted , Ramsden . We 'll need a history . " <p> " There is no history . Since I was disbarred , my sexual history is as barren as the Sahara-well , with the exception of one small oasis , which , I might add , turned out to be an illusion . " I was babbling . Fortunately I stopped short of detailing my stay at Madame Helga 's , as a janitor . Maybe I was infected . " Never mind , " I said and hung up . " Drive , Cleetis , fast . " <p> I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , even if I had to save the world to do it . <p> So this , I thought , was a reality flux generator . It looked to me like another junked car , a rusted out Ford Fairmont with no windows or doors , and long ago , someone had burned the seats down to the springs . It lay in a weedy lot with an auto upholstery shop on one side and an abandoned health food restaurant on the other . The problem with moving the car like Fang had said would n't be with the car-it would be with the six guys who loitered next to it , roasting weenies over a can of burning gasoline . One of them had a medium-sized chainsaw and sat on a spool of yellow electrical cord . <p> Fang had been very precise : move it one foot north and eighteen inches southwest . <p> When I gave Cleetis his assignment , he started some lightweight blubbering . " Do n't make me do this , boss . I could smash three , four of those bums there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned .... " Saliva glistened on his lips . " We already had one person blow up on us today , boss . We could run out of luck . " <p> " Luck ? We do n't need luck . Everything I do is calculated down to the short hairs . Luck is for wimps . " I reached forward and patted him on the shoulder . " Cleetis , have I ever steered you wrong ? " <p> " No boss . " <p> " And you have a nice little cottage behind the house you can call all your own , right ? " <p> " Yes boss . " <p> " It 's much bigger than a jail cell , is n't it . " <p> He turned and stared at me . Fear choked off his blubbering . <p> " You get evenings off every now and then , I let you drive my car , and when was the last time some guy with tattoos whispered sweet somethings in your ear ? " <p> " Yeah , " he said defiantly , " but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Look again , Cleetis . It 's an electric chainsaw . We 'll just keep our distance from any outlets . " <p> " But they got extension cords , boss , big ones ! Lookit that spool that guy 's sittin ' on ! " <p> " I have a telephone here , Cleetis , and your parole officer is on insta-dial , button number three . Do n't tell me you 're going to flush our relationship . " <p> He whimpered like a newbie at Madame Helga 's . " Boss , you make life so difficult ! " <p> " I would n't ask you to just run them down , Cleetis . They 're human beings , after all , and deserve something more stylish . This is only a Buick . All you have to do is stroll over and tell them there 's a liquor store being looted on the next street . " <p> " Boss , I ca n't do that , boss- " <p> " Make the move , Cleetis , or I hit button number three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Cleetis , " I said softly . " This hesitation is beginning to make me nervous . " <p> He opened the door and the guys with the chainsaw looked up from their blackening weenies . <p> " Remember , " I said . " Look excited . Look happy . " <p> I never was clear about what went wrong . Whenever I asked him what he said , he started whining . I would n't be surprised if the little knob offered them money to jump me . <p> Cleetis kind of half ran and half shuffled across the lot to the guys and I could hear him saying something to them , but halfway there , he turned around and ran full-tilt back to the car , and the one with the chainsaw ran after him while another one dragged the plug end of the cord across the lot to the auto upholstery shop . The chainsaw buzzed to life . I never knew how threatening one of those things looked close up . <p> Of course , Cleetis had trouble starting the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield pretty badly by trying to saw through it . <p> Giving up on the window , he went after the front grill , but the chain jammed in the metal and the saw whipped him around like a rag before it threw him under the car . <p> Cleetis proved unreliable . He sat up there slapping at the steering wheel and going " Nuhh , nuhh , nuhh " and grinding the gears and stalling out the engine while the other guys hammered on the car roof with their fists , screamed at us through the windows , and pulled their friend out from under the front of the car . <p> When I saw one of them rev up the saw and start to go for the tires , I figured it was time to get involved . <p> " Cleetis ! " I screamed over the racket of the saw , " I 'm going to get you out of this mess you got us into and I do n't ever want to hear any backtalk from you . You get my message ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as a yes . " <p> I opened up the back-seat glovebox and took out the plastic bag of baking soda I kept for such emergencies . I shoved open the back door and shouted , " Free coke ! " and gave it a twenty-foot heave away from us . It splattered on a crumbled slab of asphalt . <p> They swarmed it like piranhas . <p> " Very good , " I yelled after them . " Excuse us , please . " <p> Cleetis had started the car , but he wept like an old virgin . " I ca n't do it , boss . It 's my nerves . I ca n't do it . You carryin ' around kilos of coke , people try to hack me up with a chainsaw , it do n't make no sense ! " <p> " C'est la vie , Cleetis . Just think of those tattooed arms that want to embrace you . Think of those whiskered lips crooning jail house lullabies in your ear . " <p> " Stop it , boss ! " he wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Buick rumbled to life . " Okay , I 'll do it , whatever , " he said wimpily . <p> " Hit that car from the rear , " I said . " Try to jounce it about a foot forward . " <p> While he circled behind it , I snapped on the restraining harness . " It 's on its rims , so hit it a good one . " <p> The guys with the chainsaw watched us dispassionately while they snorkeled baking soda and vomited on each other . No doubt life must have seemed quite mysterious to them . <p> Cleetis rear-ended it at about twenty-five miles an hour and the old Fairmont scooted forward about eight inches . " Push it , " I commanded him . " Move it a tad more . " He made high-pitched whining noises , but he did it . <p> " Okay now . Circle around and come at it at an angle , hit it on the right front corner . I want about a foot and a half movement this time . Use your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What a half-witted thing to say to someone with limited cognitive abilities and the intelligence of a bright hamster . Suggesting that he use his judgment was like telling a toaster oven to wash the car . <p> He got the car in position well enough , but then he floored it , ripping out parallel ditches through the empty lot , and screamed , " I ca n't take it no more ! I ca n't take it ! I got ta go back to jail . " And then we hit hard enough that I thought I was going to be diced through the harness . <p> The Fairmont leaped sideways , knocked over the can of burning gasoline I had so carelessly disregarded , and we were engulfed in flames . <p> " I gon na die ! I gon na die ! " Cleetis shrilled , flailing his hands at the windshield . <p> I did n't like seeing orange flames and black smoke lapping at the windows . Burning to death with a screaming moron was the sort of thing that made me re-evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gentility into my driver 's demeanor , whatever crude methods it might require . We were , after all , on the cusp of burning to death . <p> With both hands I got a good tight grip on the skin on each side of his scrawny little white neck . He stopped screaming long enough that I explained the situation clearly : " Put the car in reverse , " I said into his ear , " or your brain will die right here , right now . " <p> In seconds we were away from the conflagration . As we sped out of the lot and banged over the curb , I saw the guys with baking soda all over their upper lips slapping their legs and pointing at us , choking with laughter . <p> People who laugh at the misfortunes of others should be on welfare the rest of their lives . <p> " Okay , " I said . " Take us to Fang 's . We 've got bucks to collect . " <p> At last things were winding down , but Cleetis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anything . <p> " Behin ' us , boss , look behin ' us . " <p> One glance and I realized that Cleetis was doing a very good job dealing with his feelings . Perhaps I had misjudged him after all . <p> " Bum rubber , Cleetis ! " <p> Pouring out of the rat-trap houses , out the corner groceries , and out of side streets stormed dozens  --  maybe hundreds - of kitchen-knife  --  waving , raving , club-carrying , shrieking , gap-toothed , half-witted ignoroids , and I could n't tell where all of them were going , but some of them were definitely going after us . <p> My head lolled back when Cleetis floored it , and when the turbocharger kicked in , I felt my corneas flatten out and my eyeballs squeeze toward the back of my head . <p> Something about them struck chords in me that went back to the Pleistocene . They swarmed off the sidewalks ahead of us , everywhere , crawling over cars , over each other , like insects , like vermin . <p> Cleetis took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw something that made me desire the company of Madame Helga : Five or six blocks behind us , roughly over the vacant lot where we had knocked around the old car , there hovered a vast black cloud . And it was n't just black - it was so dark it looked like the absence of light , like a chunk of the interstellar void had been dropped on us . Around the vortex , the air started to spark , as though with a little more incentive , it could ignite . This whole ugly mess was Not Good . <p> " Cleetis ! Change of course : get us back to my house ! " It seemed to be the right time for some restful contemplation of what the hell was coming loose and a relaxing IV of white rum . " Jesus , Cleetis ! Slow down - keep it under eighty . " <p> Back at the intersection where we had turned , people were emptying from their houses and old laundromats and liquor stores and running toward the vacant lot , and , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first wave we saw . Maybe there was a pattern here , but I sincerely hoped it was somebody else 's job to figure out what it was . <p> " Bad news , boss ! " He was pointing to a flash off to the side but I missed it - however , I did n't miss the next one . Little saronged or Hawaiian-shirted people stood at the curb every thirty or forty feet , all of them holding bouquets of gardenias , and every time we got near one of them , they burst into flames and exploded in a fireball of heat and smoke . " Sweet creeping jesus ! Hit the brakes ! Stop ! " <p> We fishtailed through an intersection , up across the sidewalk , and took out a couple of newspaper boxes . Ten feet ahead of us stood a grinning young girl , maybe twelve years old , in purple pants and a yellow-flowered shirt . She held an armful of gardenias and I could tell by the look in her eyes , she was just waiting to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yelled at her , " It 's okay , do n't do anything , all right ? We 're on our way to talk to Fang . " <p> She nodded deeply . " Goo ' idea , " she said . <p> " Reverse course , Cleetis . Take us to the Fang man . " <p> People in this area were starting to emerge from their dens , coming out on the sidewalk and gazing up at the sky at the spinning funnel cloud of black . Gradually they began strolling in that direction . <p> It was idle speculation on my part , but I had begun to think that reality really had been fluxed and that I had had something to do with it . <p> I tried calling Vera on the car-phone , but when she answered there was a great turbulence of sound in the background , much like I would imagine wailing and gnashing of teeth might sound , and I barely made out her shouting into the phone , " ... lunatics all over the ... have guns ... call back later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his front yard on a kitchen chair , waiting for us . <p> " You move reality generator too far , " he said amiably . " Mess up everything way bad . " <p> " I messed up everything ? People have gone mandrill out there , Fang ! We almost got chainsawed , burned up , and mobbed , and it 's not even noon yet ! " <p> " No need to rave , " he said . " Just move reality generator back . " He looked at a little scrap of paper he 'd been holding in his hand . " Move generator nine inches northeast . That all . " He had a winning smile . " Wan ' ' nother Sun Lik ? " <p> " Those people are dangerous , Fang . They 'd eat their young , given half a chance . " <p> " Mebbe so , mebbe so , " he said meditatively . " But if you d'not fix , everybody get eat . " He looked up the street and nodded in that direction . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need to save skin . " <p> A pickup full of rednecks in yellowed T-shirts roared toward us with their Merle Haggard at 116 decibels . The pickup had been jacked up so the thirty-six inch wheels would fit halfway under the frame . The thing looked like a shoe box mounted on tractor tires , and had probably just been driven out of a showroom window . It still had a lot of stickers on it . The oversized engine hung below the bottom of the frame . It popped and shuddered after they turned it off and we could hear ourselves think . The neck that had been driving jumped down to street level , black cowboy hat , bloodshot eyes , " Call Me Redneck " T-shirt , and belt buckle big enough to hold a three-course meal . <p> " Hey , shitheel , this where that gook lives ? " He was missing a couple of front teeth and had a tattoo up his arm that said , " Fuck you . " A witty man . It looked like he had done it himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried had some gooey brown stuff matted on its jaws . <p> " Gook ? " I said , strolling back to the Buick . <p> " Do n't dick me around , Shitly . We already got usa nigger boy and now we need us a gook . " <p> I had the door to the car open now . " Hey , " I said , " I know where there 's an old folks ' home . You could go stomp them real easy . Most of ' em 's in wheelchairs . " Then , to Cleetis , " Pop the hood . " His pupils flared . " Do as I say ! " It clicked open . <p> " We just want us a gook for now . Is this where .... " <p> I lifted the hood , gave the rubber fuel line a stiff yank , and aimed it at the redneck . The electric fuel pump squirted gasoline far enough to significantly dampen his crud-yellow T-shirt . <p> " Hey , you bastard , you - " <p> A few quick steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Smoke ? " I asked . <p> " Uhh ... " <p> " I know . It 's a tough question . Drop the wrench and give me your keys . " <p> " Uhh . " <p> " Wan na meet Jesus with all your skin still on ? " I yelled in his face . He dropped the wrench , but stalled out on the key command . Bad short-term memory . <p> From inside the cab , one of the necks yelled down , " Screw ' im , Conway , he 's bluffing . " <p> " Well , " Conway said , " I might burn to death . " He seemed to be evaluating the pros and cons . <p> " C'm on , Con , " the truck neck yelled down , " I know where another gook lives- " <p> " Okay , Conway , " I said , backing off a step , " I give up . I guess you geniuses saw right through me . Back up in the truck with your friends , Conway . C'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the necks jeered . <p> " Dickhead ! " the other one remarked . <p> Conway just heh-heh'ed as he got up and slid into the driver 's seat . <p> I hopped up on the running board , kept my face well out of the way , stuck my hand in the window , and flicked that little black wheel on my lighter . <p> The inside of the cab WHOOFed and rednecks shot at great velocity from the doors making all-purpose exclamations of general surprise . Conway had a few flames on him , but nothing that would n't go out as soon as his flimsy T-shirt burned off him . <p> " Cleetis ! " <p> " Boss ? " The parolee had cowered under the Buick 's steering wheel . <p> " Get in the pickup . This time , I 'm driving . " <p> I saw his nostrils flare and his lips went white around the edges . But he did n't give me any backtalk . <p> There was a refrigerator full of Budweiser under the dash . Newer vehicles seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , " I said . I fired up the engine and ground it into gear . <p> The two rednecks that had been blown out the passenger door were coming back at us . Some people . <p> They got a grip on the truck bed and started pulling themselves up . <p> " All right , " I told Cleetis as I popped the clutch and raced us down Fang 's street , " hang tight . " Nothing breaks in a new engine like highspeed stop-and-go driving , and I was in the mood for it . <p> I weaved the pickup violently down the middle of the street , slammed the brakes a couple of times and from the back came the sudden shrieks and fading screams of disoriented rednecks . <p> " Are they still there ? " I yelled at Cleetis over the howling of the engine . <p> He looked back and then grinned . " All gone , boss . Now you can slow down . " <p> I floored it . My patience had run out . There was work to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those raving halfwits who were out there dogging up the right-of-way would be to go at them at high velocity while laying on the horn . If they got out of the way , fine , and if they did n't , their dangling remnants would serve a warning to the others . And if they ganged up and tried to slow us down with solid walls of human flesh , the inertia of the truck would carry us a long satisfying way . I laid on the horn . Cleetis lost his tan . <p> Ignoroids can move fast when they want to . They parted like the Red Sea - but we were , after all , on a mission to save the partially civilized world from a tidal wave of moronism . We clipped a few of them before they realized we were serious . The crowded sidewalks were a blur of screaming gap-toothed dipsticks who gave us the finger and threw at us whatever was at hand . A few buck-knives clacked off the windshield and a couple potbellied bikers dug garbage out of cans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles back to the vacant lot , and I thought Cleetis might need a little distraction , so I turned up the radio . " ... shore you can sit on my lap , as we head South , nothing to fear . Let 's play telephone , put one in my mouth , and one in my ear . " <p> Cleetis stared at one of the eight blaring speakers in the cab like it was a TV set . <p> I hit one of the buttons and changed the station . <p> " Okay , we do the news , " the announcer said . " Um , a Toronado was sighed , sighted . somewhere . What 's this button for ? Okay , right . People should stay away - Ow ! It 's caught in your zipper . " <p> I shut it off . Obviously we were n't the only ones with problems . <p> What had merely been an epidemic of sexually transmitted stupidity was now evidently some kind of rolling flux of brain-fade . Would it hit us before we got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed-eating suck-heads like everybody else ? <p> Maybe it only worked on people who had already been exposed to the virus , who had gone to bed with someone stupider than they were . Visions of Madame Helga 's tattooed flanks swam before my eyes . <p> I just wanted to get this over with . <p> Clipped to the bottom of the dash was an added-on toggle switch that was labeled NO . A truck with a nitrous oxide tank hooked up to the intake manifold ? A very handy option . I took this as a sign . The addition of a little nitrous to the combustion chambers would probably decrease the harmful emissions of this beast and at the same time boost the horsepower by fifty or sixty percent . I flipped the switch and watched the view out the side windows blur as the blood drained to the back of my head . Steering became a challenge , but at least Cleetis stopped whimpering after the G-force pressed the air out of his lungs . <p> The scene at the vacant lot was something like Heironymus Bosch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a TV for a month and force-fed a diet of Twinkies and full-sugar Kool-Aid . <p> The violent black vortex hovered over the junked car and whirled a mile into the air , as black as a hole in the sky . As far as I could tell , it did n't make a sound or ruffle a scrap of trash on the ground , but its effect on the people was one of unrestrained violence . <p> The ugliest part was the fascination people had for this thing . They came in droves , in hordes , ripping and shoving at each other , people climbing over other people , trampling them , howling and slashing at each other to get near the old car , but whatever they saw there , it was n't the piece of junk I saw . They were enraptured by the force that drew them closer . <p> As soon as they got within ten feet whatever effect it was having , it had royally , and they turned away from it with a look on their faces like their brains had fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groping and raving with renewed frenzy as they fought their way back out and clear of the mob , where they ran amok through the streets , attacking anything , pounding on cars , breaking windows , or copulating like insects in swarming mounds of arms and legs . <p> I kept one hand on the horn as I circled around to the southwest side of the wreck . At one point two guys stood in front of the truck and screamed that I should engage in onanistic practices . When they would n't move , I ran over them . <p> Actually I only ran over their legs , but in the side mirror I saw they were unrepentant - they shrieked at me and gave me the finger until other ignoroids , running crazed away from the vortex , found them and kicked them into regret . <p> I eased us forward to the critical boundary , expecting at any time to start wanting to rape and pillage . Cleetis had n't been making any noise , but he was glassy-eyed and sweat slicked his face . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I yelled at him over the noise of the engine and the ambient screaming . " Hang on . This could be hairy . " <p> He seemed to be nodding . " Ha , " he said limply . <p> " Good man . Keep a stiff upper wrist . Here we go . " <p> I put it in low and four-wheel-drive and let the shuddering vehicle creep forward . <p> It was interesting , getting stupid like that . Every foot closer we went , the more pissed off at everything I got . I got indignant that I would end up in a stupid place like this , surrounded by stupid people , dicking around with a stupid wrecked car in an ugly stupid vacant lot , and I did n't care what happened to me , I just wanted to give all those A-holes out there what they deserved for being what they were . I seethed with longing for Old Testament justice , pure and simple : round up the infidels , sell their children for street work in L.A. , rape the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone meal . They were all animals anyway . Exterminate all of them down to the last post-menstrual grandmother and sell their hair for rug padding . Exterminate them all . <p> When the undercarriage of the pickup started nudging the junker back to the position Fang wanted it to be in , for every inch it moved , the saner I became . And when I got to the point where I was willing to let most of the swine go on living , I cut the engine . <p> Everything went silent The mob had stopped circling and stood around looking embarrassed at each other . Slowly they began shuffling away , back to their homes . Overhead , the last traces of the black whirlpool of whatever-the-hell-it-was dissipated , and I could hear Cleetis start breathing again . <p> " Boss , " he said . <p> " Yo , Cleetis . " <p> " Can I have tomorrow off ? " <p> " If Fang comes through with his end of the deal , I 'll send you to Vegas for a week . With a bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the truck door . <p> I opened it up and looked down . <p> My skin turned to ice . <p> It was a ten-year-old Laotian girl with an armful of gardenias . <p> " Howdy , " she said in a piping little voice . <p> " Do n't say the rest of it ! ' I yelled at the kid . " Please do n't say it ! " <p> Cleetis began clawing at his seatbelts and screaming for his mother . <p> The kid looked puzzled and I expected to see smoke come drizzling out of her nose , but she handed me up the flowers and smiled prettily . " Goo'bye , " she said , and walked away , her brown little bare feet making neat footprints in the pulverized dirt . <p> WHEN VERA let me in her front door , I handed her the package with the two steaks she had asked me to bring . I was hungry and imagined hot steaks crisscrossed with searmarks and dripping with garlicked herbs . <p> " You 're a dear , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gray work clothes and a tight-headed mouse-brown wig she wore in public . <p> " Cleetis caught a bus for Vegas an hour ago . " I 'd given him an extra $2,000 and I was once again a monied person deeply concerned about the IRS . <p> " Like a drink ? " <p> " D' you have any beer ? " <p> She handed me a Kirin from the refrigerator . She was a woman of taste . I hated to drink it fast , but I had done a lot of sweating that day . <p> I asked her if she knew what was being said about the disturbance across town that afternoon . <p> " The police think it was a race riot , but Atlanta says there are some indications that it might have been related to STS . Some kind of massive outbreak . But it does n't fit the pattern . What do you know about it ? " She peeled the tape off the package of meat . <p> " I 've been out driving around all day , re-familiarizing myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living with Cleetis can give a person a distorted perspective , you know . " She was handling the meat suggestively . " Can I take a shower before we eat ? " <p> " Eat ? " she said . " Oh . You mean the steaks . They 're not for us to eat . " She pulled off her wig and took a couple of clips out of her hair . After combing her fingers through it and shaking her head , her hair puffed up hugely . She unbuttoned her jacket and hung it over a chair . " Ramsden , what do you really know about what happened ? " <p> " I would just as soon not be on a steady diet of Thorazine and electroshock , but I can say this : According to my source , everything is connected to everything else , so that if you , say , move a piece of junk across a vacant lot , the effects can be immense . The riot and STS , I was led to believe , were aspects of the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is elusive . " <p> She cocked her head a little and gazed at me . The moment was broken by the chirp of her phone . She answered it , listened briefly , and handed it over to me . " For you . " <p> " What , " I said into the thing . <p> " Ramsden ! Vreedon here ! Long story ! I 'm out ! I was commuted ! " <p> " How did you find me ? And stop shouting ! " <p> " Long story ! Hey , I met this guy named Kam Fang ! He showed me this incredible pyramid deal ! You ever hear of these MENSA people ? I 'm gunna be rich ! All I need is about five thousand - " <p> I hung up . " Wrong number . " <p> Vera glanced back over her shoulder at me as she ambled into the bedroom , steaks in hand . I followed her , ready for anything . " Mr. Ramsden , you have nice eyes . " <p> " You have nice legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ways than one . <p> " Shall one of us seduce the other ? " <p> " Seduction requites subtlety . And I 've had a long day . " <p> She lifted the bedroom window and threw the steaks out . I heard huge dogs growling and massive jaws crunching bones . <p> " That 'll keep them quiet for a while , in case they hear any unusual noises . " <p> " Ms. Kamchatka . " <p> " Mr. Ramsden .
