<p> Readers offer opinions on mill-levy hike for DPS <p> A vote against ballot measure 3A , the $ 30 million mill levy increase to benefit the Denver Public Schools , is not only a vote against the administration ; it is also a vote against our children and our future . <p> Our city needs a strong public school system that has the resources to deliver a quality education to our children . <p> Budget cuts the past three years have necessitated that each school make tough decisions regarding what programs and teachers must be cut . <p> With each year of budget cuts , the impact is felt more and more by the children themselves . <p> Some of the unfortunate results have been : larger class sizes , fewer course offerings , insufficient and outdated text books . Without additional money , DPS will struggle to maintain even the current level of quality , a difficult task in the face of additional cuts . <p> If you want to express your distrust or frustration with the administration or if you want to see educational policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our schools . Instead , get involved ! <p> Be part of the solution , not part of the problem . Vote " Yes " on 3A for a strong community and future ! <p> ELLEN SELIG , Manual parent and 14-year DPS parent <p> Denver <p> Do n't be fooled by the new tax for the Denver Public Schools that we will vote on Nov. 7th . New taxes have never helped any school system to improve . For example , the Washington , D.C. , school system spends over $ 9,500 per pupil per year and has the second highest illiteracy rate in the nation . <p> The only method to help any public school system is to have competition . We desperately need a voucher system so that there is freedom of choice . Our country was founded on free enterprise , and the only way to have free enterprise with the school system is to pay for the schools that we want our children to attend , whether they be private or public . Vote NO to new taxes for DPS and vote yes to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Denver <p> As a Denver County property owner and taxpayer ( more than 50 percent of whose property taxes are allocated to DPS ) , I am aghast at the prospect of an additional $ 30 million tax-derived dollars being placed at the discretion of Superintendent Irv Moskowitz . <p> During his tenure Moskowitz has consistently demonstrated poor judgment and lack of insight in reaching appropriate decisions on key issues . This was evident last May when he inappropriately scapegoated 12 school principals and Ruben Perez instead of identifying substantive solutions to obstacles in the educational process . <p> We as Denver property taxpayers and " stockholders " of the DPS " corporation " must reject the proposed $ 30 million tax hike and demand that instead Moskowitz actually perform the duties for which he is being paid . These include developing innovative solutions to improve the educational process that require neither the input of $ 30 million nor the mindless , harmful reduction in student programs and teaching positions . <p> JIM SCHRIMPSCHER <p> Aurora <p> Debate boils over Amendment 2 issue <p> Al Knight 's feeble and ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be laughable if not for the seriousness of the issue . <p> Get real , Al . <p> If you honestly think that homosexuals do n't experience discrimination , you need to talk to anyone who 's ever been in the armed forces , ever tried unsuccessfully to get a security clearance , ever paid significantly higher taxes because their relationships do n't count - the list is endless . <p> I could marry the first woman on the street I see and five minutes later have more civil rights than I will have after my companion and have been together 20 years . If that 's not discriminatory , I do n't know what is . <p> DAVID W. MADDUX <p> Denver <p> Whenever logic starts creeping into the Amendment 2 debate , you can count on Al Knight to be there railing against all those who oppose his cherished amendment . This time ( Oct. 15 ) he lambastes the U.S. Supreme Court for failing to see the wisdom of singling out a particular group of citizens for discrimination . <p> Knight laments " the court 's apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . " Any gay person would have to lament Knight 's apparent inattention to the Christian Right 's ongoing campaign to deny homosexuals their equal rights through legal initiatives . <p> When Knight says Amendment 2 is n't about libraries and " there was never a hint that homosexuals should lose any rights they otherwise enjoy as citizens , " it shows he 's never put aside his own anti-gay bias long enough to read any of these initiatives . He 'd have seen that this issue is indeed about libraries and systematically depriving homosexuals of the same rights enjoyed by other citizens . <p> The Oregon and Washington initiatives ban gay books , legalize employment and housing discrimination against gays , make the children of gays wards of the state if , after a divorce , the other biological parent is n't heterosexual , prohibit gays from working in certain occupations , etc . The other initiatives , by preventing gays from seeking judicial redress , achieve the same goals . Who else would enjoy these same " rights " ? <p> If Knight and those like him have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting so hard for the right to do so ? <p> MICHAEL T. GALVIN <p> Denver <p> The Pankratz/Booth article on Amendment 2-related bias against lesbians and gays points to the paucity of complaints filed in jurisdictions with anti-discrimination laws as evidence of a lack of anti-gay bias . They left out some factors : <p> First , filing such a complaint often means revealing one 's sexual orientation to a much wider arena than desired . This is dangerous for many lesbians and gays , who could be subject to more discrimination as theresult . <p> Second , is success of the law measured by the number of complaints filed , or instead by the lack of complaints ? Perhaps the anti-discrimination laws are preventing discrimination from taking place in some cases . <p> Pankratz and Booth should research how many times lesbian , gay , or bisexual people in these jurisdictions have attempted to gain " special rights " under protection of the laws , as proponents of Amendment 2 would have us believe ? <p> We bet the answer is none . <p> JEANNIE D. DICLEMENTI <p> MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) assumes that Colorado voters did " something hurtful " to homosexuals by passing Amendment 2 . She claims Amendment 2 denies gays their civil rights based on sexual orientation . <p> Sexual orientation should not qualify one for special protection under civil rights laws . By rescinding the falsely based " civil rights " ordinances in Boulder , Aspen and Denver , Amendment 2 takes nothing from gays which is rightfully theirs but merely seeks to restore a level legal playing field for all , gays and non-gays alike , in these cities . <p> Amendment 2 , once it is in our state Constitution , will restore to all of us , non-gays and gays alike , the right to freedom of association , a treasured right which opponents of Amendment 2 like to ignore and which gay-rights ordinances violate . <p> CHARLES L. KING <p> Boulder <p> ' Town meetings ' <p> no place to play God <p> I hope I misunderstood the approach the Colorado Collective for Medical Decisions is taking to medical ethics ( Oct. 15 ) . Is the standard for difficult life-and-death decisions really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " town meetings " ? What a frightening proposition ! <p> About 18 months ago , my sister died after a seven-year battle with brain cancer . In determining what treatment would and would not be allowed during the last few years of Eileen 's life , my family struggled to find the line between " extending life " and " prolonging death . " I assure you , we did not make those decisions based on what our neighbors thought . Nor did we rely solely on the medical profession to advise us . Fortunately , we had a standard beyond the latest human knowledge and opinion : We relied on the truths presented in Judeo-Christian ethics . <p> The " correct " decisions were not magically laid out before my family as we opened the Scriptures . But I rest secure in the knowledge that we had an unchanging standard on which to base our decisions . <p> Should this time-tested standard be ignored simply because not all people subscribe to Judeo-Christian beliefs ? If so , consensus guidelines will be subject to the whims of the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that these guidelines are not applied to me or my family . <p> KAREN FISHER <p> Denver <p> Prod Envirotest <p> Envirotest is being fined for poor performance regarding wait times . This does not help the car owner . Instead of a fine which goes into the Colorado general fund , give the test free to the car owner who waits over 15 minutes .
