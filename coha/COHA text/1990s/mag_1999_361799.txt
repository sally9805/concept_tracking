" The sky , the sky/ Hands up , hands up high/ Finish high , finish reverse C. " <P> That 's what golf pros were teaching back in the 1950s and ' 60s . The classic swing  --  big and full , finishing in a perfect " reverse C. " Unfortunately , that same classic swing can put your average 50-year-old in the hospital . Top tour players like Jack Nicklaus , Lee Trevino , Tom Kite and Fuzzy Zoeller , to name a few , have at one time or another each been sidelined with career-threatening back injuries . Today even younger players like Fred Couples , Peter Jacobsen and Tiger Woods have closeted that backbreaking motion , along with their steel-shafted drivers , in favor of the gentle power of graphite and a more balanced , upright , back-friendly swing . <P> What makes the golf swing so hard on the back ? University of Southern California orthopedic surgeon Robert G. Watkins says it 's the repetitive extremes in rotation and compression that go with the sport . " Spine injuries lead the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Watkins , spine consultant to the Professional Golfers ' Association Tour and editor of The Spine in Sports ( Mosby , 1996 ) . " It 's true for amateurs too . " <P> The human spine simply was n't designed to swing a golf club . A 1996 study showed both professional and amateur golfers generating " peak spinal compression loads " of 6,000 newtons ( a measure of gravitational force ) . That 's the equivalent of eight times an individual 's standing body weight . These back-crunching levels are " close to the known failure loads associated with lumbar intervertebral joints , " concludes Thomas P. Headman , a biomechanical engineer at the University of Southern California . <P> The same study clocked amateurs generating 85 Nm ( newton meters ) of torque , compared to 57 Nm generated by professionals with more energy-efficient swings . Normal joints in the spine fail , Watkins notes , at 88 Nm of torque , while degenerated joints , typical of avid or professional golfers , fail at 54 Nm . <P> The two principal trouble spots are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of each vertebrae , that act as brakes to rotation . Each disk is a round ligament , made up of an annulus , which is like a multilayered collagen basket that absorbs rotational stress , and a lighter-density liquid nucleus that absorbs compression . The layers of the annulus are woven for maximum absorption . But it does n't take much to tear this basket . " You can tear the annulus with no more than 3degrees of sudden loaded rotation , " Watkins says . " If the disk ruptures into the spinal canal , it can injure the sciatic nerves that run down to the legs . " Couples once likened the resulting pain to " a hand grenade going off in my back . " Facet joints are more prone to arthritic changes and to producing bone spurs that narrow the spinal canal . <P> So why does n't the hand grenade go off every time you swing a golf club ? Coordinated muscle function . That 's what enables John Daly to hit 1,000 practice balls a week with a swing speed exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to hurt the spine , " Watkins says . " Pros do n't generate these peak torques on their spine like the amateur does , because of coordinated muscle function . They can still get in trouble , because they do it 10,000 times . But it 's not because they do n't have the coordinated muscle strength to protect their backs . "
