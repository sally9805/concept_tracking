Jean-Louis Dumas wo n't sit still . He wants you to feel the sleeve of his cashmere jacket , listen to the ping of his crystal goblet , ponder the intricate pattern of his silk tie . He wants you to follow him out a side door of his elegant office and down a back staircase to a craftsman 's workshop virtually unchanged since the 19th century . All the while , he is rhapsodizing , " This is amazing ! This is unique ! This is fantastique ! " In the workshop , with a view across the roofs of Paris , a leatherworker hand-stitches one of four golf bags ordered by a Tokyo real estate developer . The material : fire- engine-red Indonesian crocodile hide . Price : $23,763 each . <P> Money is not the issue for customers of Hermes , a onetime harness shop founded in 1837 by Dumas 's great-great-grandfather . The object is mystique . Princess Grace of Monaco christened the " Kelly handbag , " a boxy Hermes classic she often carried . Wearing an Hermes scarf , Queen Elizabeth adorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermes shop to pick up leatherbound datebooks , and Gregory Peck to be fitted for handmade shoes . But if the rich and racy have always known about Hermes , it is only recently that a New Jersey stockbroker or a Dallas debutante has been able to buy a piece of the dream in her own hometown . <P> The rapid expansion of a once sleepy , snobbish concern into a global retailing empire is a triumph for Dumas , 52 , one of 17 cousins who control 87% of the firm . A silver-tongued swashbuckler who spent a year as an assistant buyer for Bloomingdale 's in Manhattan , Dumas has boosted Hermes annual sales ninefold , to $460 million , since he took over in 1978 . Moving aggressively into the U.S. and the Far East , he has opened 80 new shops , bringing the total to 238 . Thirty more are planned .

( $525 . ) A suitcase made of carbon fiber , adapted from the sheathing on the European Space Agency 's Ariane rocket ? ( $5,450 . ) Dumas has expanded the product line to 30,000 items . <P> In the world of luxury , which ranks alongside aerospace as France 's primary % export industry , Hermes likes to call itself " a firm apart . " It has resisted predatory takeover artists who have swallowed up such venerable family strongholds as Louis Vuitton and Lanvin . It has refused to license its name to sell discount luggage a la Pierre Cardin or mass-produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermes different is its stubborn adherence to century-old manufacturing techniques . " Hermes is an anachronism , " says Gene Pressman , executive vice president of Barney 's , the upscale clothing chain . " It 's about quality that 's made to last . "
