IT IS A GORGEOUS , LATE SUMMER AFternoon , and the kitchen of James Carville and Mary Matalin 's weekend retreat in Front Royal , Va. , is a picture of bipartisan bliss inhabited by two hearts that now beat as one . Almost . The two phone lines and the fax machine are mercifully silent , and a bottle of robust red wine is open and ready for drinking . Yet the minute Matalin turns her back , Carville slyly sprinkles more parsley into the tuna salad  --  just the way he likes it . There was a time when Matalin made it her business to watch Carville 's every move . In the 1992 presidential campaign , she was George Bush 's political director ; he was Bill Clinton 's top strategist . Now , after a year of marriage , Matalin and Carville say they can go weeks without wrangling over politics . " We still get into it sometimes , " says Matalin . " But we know we 're never going to change the other guy . " The pair is capitalizing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , War , and Running for President ( Random House/Simon &; Schuster ) , a joint look back at the 1992 campaign for which they received a reported $900,000 advance . Yet as they embark on a 12-city book tour , Carville frets that they will be expected to bicker on demand . " That is not the real us , " he insists . Book buyers looking for surprising revelations about the 1992 race will be disappointed by All 's Fair . Carville and Matalin do n't serve up the emotional details of their year apart . ( " I could have told more personal stories , " Matalin admits . " But they would n't have added to the book . " ) Nor do they spill many backroom secrets , though Matalin does confirm something she fiercely denied during the race : that the White House considered dumping Dan Quayle . Yet the book , written in a conversational format , is an entertaining look at the whiteknuckle tensions of a national campaign and at the arcane art of spin control . Since the bitter race , Matalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , Equal Time , and a commentator 's berth on Today . Carville , 50 next month , is an adviser to the Clinton White House and a hot ticket on the speaking circuit . ( Their husband-and-wife act attracts speaking fees of up to $20,000 . ) But Carville 's star has been dimmed by stinging campaign losses in New Jersey , California and Los Angeles . " It 's difficult for me to walk into a campaign the way I used to , " he says . " I 've become more of a character tian a consultant . " Fame , however , brings other compensations . In Washington , where social status transcends party affiliation , Carville and Matalin are indisputably A-list . Bill Clinton hosted a White House reception in honor of their engagement last year . In May they were among the select few invited to witness the marriage of Rush Limbaugh and freelance journalist Marta Fitzgerald at the home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . Says Limbaugh : " You get married these days , and people say , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever two people it was said about , it was Mary and James . That 's one of the reasons we wanted them at our wedding . " Washington 's least likely romance began in early 1991 , after Matalin , then chief of staff at the Republican National Committee , told a friend she would like to meet Carville , then making a name for himself as a hotshot consultant to Democratic candidates . Political differences aside , the pair immediately discovered vast common ground . Both were raised with few privileges in what Matalin describes as " huge , extended , loving families "  --  he in Louisiana , in a tiny town named Carville , where his family ran the post office and the general store ; she in South Chicago , where her father worked in a steel mill and her mother owned a beauty parlor . Both were obsessed by the nuts and bolts of campaigning . Soon , she sys , she was " big-time smitten . " So much so that when Matalin , who was about to land her dream job with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to work for Clinton ( he was still trying to find a way to tell her ) , she went to the bathroom and threw up . Yet somehow , says Carville , " I always thought we would survive the election . " In an attempt to deflect attention from the romance , they publicly declared the relationship on hold , yet kept in daily contact through a separate phone line installed in Matalin 's Washington office . Within a week after Clinton 's victory , they embarked on a vacation to Paris and Venice . But Matalin remained depressed for months by Bush 's loss . " I was seriously in the fetal position , " she says . " Some days I 'd wake up crying , unable to do anything . " Nor was she enthusiastic about revisiting the Bush defeat in a joint book  --  a project , Matalin says , that turned out to be " painful from beginning to end . " Carville and Matalin each spent months dictating their memories into a tape recorder . " James is an orator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , " she says . " I kept rewriting , in some cases five times . " A more recent ordeal for the newlyweds has been Matalin 's two miscarriages . " I do n't think the significance of getting married hit us until then , " she says . " It 's a totally new feeling to lean on someone , and I never thought I 'd be able to do it , even with Carville . I ca n't wait to have a baby . I really ca n't . " Matalin , who was married briefly while in college and then a second time in 1983 ( to Art Amold , a fellow staffer at the Republican National Committee ) , says the never-married Carville had a terrible time popping the question . " Finally one night we were at a stock-car race sitting on the hood of a pickup truck , and he admitted that he did n't know how to propose , " she says . " So I said , " Repeat after me , " and I did the proposal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Orleans last Thanksgiving gravitated to two separate bars  --  one for Democrats and another for Republicans . On weekends , the two leave Matalin 's Washington condo and head for their A-frame Virginia cabin , where they curl up in bed reading books or watching The Andy Grifith Show , Carville 's favorite program . They like to have lots of family around , and at Christmas they put on a catered dinner for the Carville clan from Louisiana , presided over by James 's mother , Lucille , 75 , whom he phones every day . The solid state of their union is no surprise to her . Says the matriarch , known universally as Miss Nippy : " I think men who are devoted to their mothers make good husbands .
