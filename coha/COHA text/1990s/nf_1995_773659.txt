BLOOD PRESSURE Studies of blood pressure differences between Black , White , Mexican American , and Oriental children disagree . Some show differences in blood pressure by race , ' 29-131 while others do not.13 ' . ' 33 Control for season of the year decreases differences , ' ' " while control for whether subjects were asleep or awake increases differences . ' 33 Evidence indicates that whatever the race , overweight and obese children have higher blood pressure than normal to underweight children . ' 32. ' 34- ' 35 Children with elevated systolic pressure are three times more likely to be obese than other children.135 Diastolic elevations show a similar but less marked correlation with obesity . PULSE AND TEMPERATURE Full-term Black fetuses and Black newborns have significantly higher heart rates than newborn Whites , even when socioeconomic level is controlled . ' 36- ' 37 Although socioeconomic level affects heart rate , it does not account for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' heart rates are 6 beats per minute faster when socioeconomic level is controlled ; 736 when socioeconomic level is not controlled , the heart rate is 9 beats per minute faster . ' 37 Curiously , the pulse rate difference reverses1 ' 9 ' 13 " or becomes similar139 ? 740 in Black and White children of preschool age . Mexican American preschool children have pulse rates similar to those of Black and White children.139 The pulse rate declines until adolescence , and becomes higher in Whites than in Blacks by 16 years of age.147 Pulse rates are higher in females than in males at all ages.138,740,741 Newborn body temperature may also vary by race , but the evidence is sparse and contradictory . Two studies of Black and White infants report opposite findings . One study of 116 newborns ( half of them Black and half of them White ) in which axillary temperatures were measured indicated a statistically significant 0.5 degree higher body temperature for the White newborns.142 Another study of 247 newborns ( also about half White and half Black ) using rectal temperature measurements showed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the same , but the lighter and thinner Black newborns may have a lower surface temperature , reflected in the axillary temperature . LABORATORY MEASURES The normal hemoglobin level for Blacks is up to I g lower than for Whites . ' 43- ' 47 Data indicate that , given similar socioeconomic status , Native Americans , Mexican Americans , Oriental Americans , and White Americans do not differ . ' ' ' " 15 ' // Socioeconomic status is strongly associated with hemoglobin levels : the poor have lower levels than the middle and upper classes.149 However , Blacks have lower hemoglobin levels even when socioeconomic status is controlled . ' 43 There is some indication that , given similar socioeconomic conditions , Asian Americans and Mexican Americans may have higher levels than Whites . ' 52.153 One study of dietary patterns indicated that diet explained from 8 to 10 percent of the variance in hemoglobin levels in 10- and 15-year-old Black and White children ; race explained 7 to 9 percent of the variance , while gender explained 36 percent of the difference in 15-year-olds.154 Blacks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serum ferritin , and transferrin saturation.147 The cause of lower hemoglobin values in Blacks undoubtedly has a genetic component , but other variables also contribute to the difference . Serum cholesterol levels are also associated with socioeconomic status . Children from higher socioeconomic levels tend to have higher cholesterol levels , 155 but racial affiliation has an even stronger association . Black children have a higher serum cholesterol level than White children , ' 56 even when socioeconomic level is considered.155 The higher total serum cholesterol of Black children contains a higher proportion of high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , the protective cholesterol , than is present in White children.157 These differences remain after controlling for fatness , smoking , alcohol consumption , age , sexual maturation , oral contraceptive use , and serum triglycerides . It is likely that the difference is genetic . Serum albumin and serum transferrin were measured in Black and White children from 1 to 3.5 years of age.158 Albumin did not differ by race , but transferrin did . The mean values for serum transferrin ranged from 200 to 400 mg per 100 ml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 319.7 mg and the Blacks a mean of 341.4 mg . This overall difference was mainly due to a considerable difference between the girls ( 340.4 mg for Blacks and 304.4 mg for Whites ) . The boys differed , but not as much ( 342.9 mg for Blacks and 337.7 mg for Whites ) . The higher serum transferrin levels in Black children may be due to their lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.159 Transferrin levels increase in the presence of anemia . Because Blacks have lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels , their higher transferrin levels may be normal . The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in amniotic fluid indicates fetal pulmonary maturation . This ratio , which is used to calculate the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants , differs between Blacks and Whites , as does the pulmonary maturity it predicts.160 From 23 to 42 weeks of gestation , Blacks have higher ratios than Whites . Lung maturity , measured by a lecithin/ sphingomyelin ratio of 2.0 , is reached in the 34th week for Blacks compared with the 35th week for Whites . White premature infants have a 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio between 1.5 and 1.9 . Black premature infants have a much lower risk of respiratory distress syndrome // at the same ratio . The specific risk for Blacks has not been calculated , but the disease is 40 percent less likely to produce death in premature Blacks than in premature Whites.16 ' When the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio is determined before induction of labor or elective cesarean section , racial differences should be considered . Apgar scores also differ somewhat between Blacks and Whites . Black babies have lower 1 minute Apgar scores than do White babies : 88.4 percent of Black babies reach 7 or higher , compared with 91.3 percent of White babies.16 " By 5 minutes , the difference is reduced to 1.8 percent ( 96.4 percent for Blacks and 98.2 percent for Whites ) . These differences are not clinically significant , but they demonstrate the variation in infant condition because of socioeconomic levels . Specifically , Apgar scores may be lower due to low birth weight and the mother 's young age , low education level , few prenatal visits , and unmarried status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White mothers . DISEASE DIFFERENTIAL Children of various races react differently to some diseases . In a particular group , a disease may be more or less severe , or individuals may be more or less susceptible to a disease ( see Chapter 5 under Biochemical Variation and Differential Disease Susceptibility ) . Certain conditions that affect children are mentioned here : neonatal jaundice , ABO incompatibility , G6PD , cystic fibrosis , sickle cell disease , otitis media , and the incidence of congenital abnormalities . NEONATAL JAUNDICE Clinical jaundice is present in over 50 percent of Oriental and American Indian babies . ' 63- ' 65 Bilirubin levels are correspondingly high in these groups compared with Black and White infants . Approximately 25 percent of Oriental and American Indian infants have bilirubin values above 12 mg per 100 ml. a value considered to be in the upper range of normal ; 163a66 15 to 23 percent have values above 15 mg per 100 ml , which is considered pathologic for White infants.163167 Not only do Oriental and American Indian infants have higher normal bilirubin values , but their blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with the second to third day for other races.163 ? ' " Breastfeeding increases bilirubin values in all babies , L68 but the effect is stronger in Orientals and American Indians.164 The higher range of bilirubin levels in Orientals and American Indians does not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of kernicterus.764. ' 69 High altitude also increases bilirubin values . Hyperbilirubinemia was present in 39 percent of newborns from 3100 m ( 10,171 ft ) and in 16 percent of newborns from 1600 m ( 5250 ft ) .10 The increased bilirubin level in newborns presumably has a physiological function . It is argued that a condition which affects most Infants can not he // pathological , because natural selection would have decreased its incidence . " ' It has been shown that the hospital practice of limiting breastfeeding to a 4-hour schedule enhances jaundice by limiting caloric intake . ' 72 It is also possible that bilirubin acts as an antioxidant in newborns until their antioxidant enzyme defense system matures. ' 7 ' ABO INCOMPATIBILITY A more serious type of neonatal jaundice that shows racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early fetal loss when the fetus is A or B blood type and the mother is 0 blood type . Fetal wastage caused by ABO incompatibility occurs in 18 percent of maternal-fetal ABO incompatible pregnancies.13 At term , about 1 percent of the surviving infants are affected with ABO hemolytic disease . Asian , Black , and Hispanic White infants have significantly higher direct antiglobulin test ( DAT ) results than White infants , ranging from 50 percent for Asians to 28 percent for Whites . However , the rate of exchange transfusions does not differ . " GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE ( G6PD ) DEFICIENCY G6PD deficiency is also a cause of neonatal jaundice.15 Since approximately 10 percent of the world 's population has this genetic abnormality , G6PD is an important cause of neonatal jaundice . Heterozygotes produce from 25 to 50 percent abnormal hemoglobin ; consequently , G6PD acts like an autosomal dominant . G6PD occurs in people originating from areas where malaria is common ? Mediterranean and African countries . See Chapter 5 under the Malaria Connected Conditions subsection for more details on G6PD . CYSTIC FIBROSIS Seventy percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whites . ' 7 ' ' This particular gene is present in only 37 percent of affected Blacks ; other defects are responsible for the rest of the disease incidence . Black children with cystic fibrosis generally have a less severe form of the disease than White children . ' 76 They also have lower rates of cystic fibrosis than White children . ' There is also a connection between sweat chlorides and cystic fibrosis . Children with cystic fibrosis have higher sweat chloride levels than normal children and usually have lower galvanic skin resistance . ' 77 Black children have lower sweat chloride levels than White children . See Chapter 2 under the Sweat and Sebum subsection . SICKLE CELL DISEASE Sickle cell disease is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 , but since most patients with the disease are children , data on population differences will be mentioned here . The disease is commonly thought to affect Blacks exclusively , but that is not so . Although Blacks have a much higher incidence of sickle cell // disease than other races , occasional cases occur in individuals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Native American origin . ' 78 , ' 79 There seem to be two levels of severity in sickle cell disease ? a less severe form , present more often in the non-Black population , and the more severe classic form more prevalent in Blacks . For further information , see Chapter 5 under the Sickle Cell Hemoglobin subsection . OTITIS MEDIA Otitis media is much more prevalent in American Indians , Alaskan Eskimos , New Zealand Maori , and Australian Aborigines than in Blacks or Whites . ' 80-'s2 In the United States , Whites have a higher incidence than Blacks ; 183- ' 85 Whites make substantially more visits to physicians for otitis media , 18 " and White children fail tympanometric screenings more often than Black children . ' 87 , ' 88 There is much speculation concerning these differences , but little hard data . Socioeconomic conditions , specifically poor nutrition , poor hygiene , and crowding , are cited as possible risk enhancers.18 ' ? ' 89 The lack of breastfeeding may be a precipitator. ' " - Anatomic differences in the size and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otitis media is quite prevalent in Eskimo children today , but was not prevalent during the childhood of most adult Eskimos . ' 82 Orientals do not seem to get otitis media in extraordinary proportions . These pieces of evidence point toward an environmental cause , either socioeconomic , nutritional , or climatic . Hearing acuity differs by race . The 1960 and 1970 National Health Surveys give a fairly consistent picture of Blacks having slightly better hearing at the low and high ends of the tested frequencies ( 250 and 6000 hertz ) , while Whites have slightly better hearing at the middle frequencies ( 2000 and 4000 hertz ) . ' 9 ' - ' 9 ' Blacks are also less susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss in the mid- and high-frequency regions . ' 95 The reason for these differences are unknown , but some anatomical difference in the middle ear may protect Blacks against both otitis media and hearing loss . CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES Several of the more common congenital abnormalities differ by racial group , but few studies have compared specific races . Table 3.1 was derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that Blacks have a high incidence of polydactyly and supernumerary nipples ( 5 per 1000 ) ; a moderately high incidence of hypospadias , cleft gum or uvula , and talipes equinovarus ( 1 to 5 per 1000 ) ; and a low incidence of the other conditions . Whites have a low incidence of supernumerary nipples and a moderately high incidence of the other conditions . Chinese have a low incidence of syndactyly , hypospadias , and talipes equinovarus and a moderately high incidence of polydactyly and cleft lip and palate . Japanese have a moderately high incidence of cleft lip and palate and a low incidence of talipes equinovarus . American Indians have a moderately high incidence of cleft lip and palate , and Hawaiians // OTHER VARIATIONS LACTOSE INTOLERANCE The vast majority ( 80 to 90 percent ) of persons of all races except Whites are lactose intolerant as adults . Only 10 to 15 percent of Whites are lactose intolerant . This condition is covered more fully in Chapter 5 under the Lactose // autosomal dominant characteristic . ' " ' The age of onset is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digest lactose by the third year of life , while the remainder lose it during adolescence . ' " Nutritional advice for lactose intolerant individuals is controversial . No data demonstrate that the USRDA calcium requirements are necessary for all races , let alone the White Americans for whom they were devised . It is safe to suggest that children who suffer gastrointestinal symptoms from milk ingestion not be required to drink it . Clinicians should remember that the bones of Black children are denser than those of White children , and that their teeth are freer from decay , though they consume less milk.1 " Meeting the USRDA calcium requirement without consuming milk or milk products is difficult unless calcium supplements are used . If a family 's traditional diet includes foods that contain calcium ( as many vegetables do ) . and the children appear well nourished , it may be conservative practice to avoid urging nutritional changes to meet standard calcium requirements . TWINNING RATES Monozygotic twinning is similar in all races , but dizygotic twinning differs , being highest in Blacks ( up to 5 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whites , and 0.5 percent for Asians.198 In the United States , a multiple-birth ratio , which is the number of live births in multiple deliveries per 1000 live births , is calculated annually . This ratio runs about 18.6 for Whites and 24.2 for Blacks . The ratio rises with maternal age ; for instance , mothers 35 to 39 years of age have a multiple-birth ratio of 27.1 compared with 13.1 for mothers 15 to 19 years of age.199 Blacks and Whites are affected similarly by the age change . SUMMARY The existence of population differences in growth rates , in body size and shape , in specific features . even in some common laboratory measurements , and in reaction to diseases should persuade health workers to consider health measurements carefully . In the absence of specific indicators to the contrary , a physically active and progressing child , who may be a little thin or short by White standards , but who is alert and without obvious signs of illness , is likely to be healthy ; clinicians should not be too quick to suspect growth retardation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been done on White children ; where racial comparisons are made , studies focus on Black and White children . Some data is starting to come out on Mexican American children . but little is available on growth and development in American Indians , Alaskan Eskimos . and Oriental American children . Chapter 4 DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION IN ADULTHOOD Contrary to reports in the popular press , certain populations do not seem t differ in the attainment of extreme old age . The so-called long-lived groups - Russians from the Caucasus mountains , Hunzas from the Karakoram mour tains in West Pakistan , and Ecuadorans from the Andes mountains ? live t be no older than the general population in the United States . Reputed centenaians from these mountain societies , when investigated , are most often in the seventies or eighties . ' Rarely does an individual reach 100 years of age ; and th oldest verified age of any human is 120 years. = Reasons given for age exaggeration include the desire to advertise the health benefits of living in th Russian mountains , taking on the identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a celebrity , and the increased prestige of age members of a group . The upper end of the life span appears to be similar in all populations . For instance , the 1970 United States Social Security Administration indicated the 6200 people 100 years of age or older were receiving benefits . These figure are comparable with Japanese birth and death records that have been maintained for the past 100 years . ' However , United States census figures for th same year ( 1970 ) showed 107,467 centenarians , 17 times more than the socit security figures . This demonstrates that Americans also exaggerate their age ; but have not received as much publicity as more exotic mountain folk . While the extreme end of the life span does not differ among groups , life expectancy does , because socioeconomic and health conditions affect life expectancy.3-5 For instance , in the United States . White males can expect to liv 7 years longer than Black males , and White females can expect to live 6 year longer than Black females. ? United States statistics display life expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others " . Although Blacks are included in the " all others category , they are also singled out . ' This reporting convention does not alto ) an adequate picture of the other racial groups , but life expectancy for the tot " all others " category is intermediate between Blacks and Whites . Further analysis of the " all other " category indicates that Blacks , American Indian : and Eskimos have lower life expectancies than Asian Americans and East Indians.8 White women have the highest life expectancy at birth ? 79.3 years ; " a other " category women are next at 76.3 years , followed by Black women 74.5 years . Life expectancy for White men is 72.6 years ; for " all other " me it is 68.4 years , and for Black men it is 66.0 years . ' Vital statistics records indicate that the " all other " category population ha had a more pronounced increase in longevity than the White populatior // Between 1988 and 1990 , " all other " males added 1.3 years to their life expectancy , and Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.3 years . ' " All other " category females added 1.2 years to their life expectancy , and Black females added 1.1 year , but White females added only 0.4 years . Vital statistics data also show a switch in longevity patterns around 65 and 75 years , when " all other " survival becomes better than White survival . ' This probably occurs because older " all other " individuals are very healthy individuals who have survived less ideal living conditions than their White counterparts . The United States ranks 11th in total life expectancy among the other industrialized countries.9 Japan ranks first , with a total life expectancy of 78.9 years , while several European countries and Canada also rank above the United States , where total life expectancy at 75.4 years is 3.5 years lower than in Japan . Whether the span of life is produced by natural selection or whether it is a by-product of selection is unknown . If life span is selected for , then there is a chance that the process will be understood in the near future and will lead to measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigation would be in the molecular genetics basis of aging and in the mechanisms of putative developmental clocks . " " If life span is a by-product , then the chances for understanding are much further away because of multifactorial , causation . One " putative developmental clock " may be the age at menopause . Women who experience menopause later than the mean age for menopause live longer than women who experience menopause earlier . ' ' - " Ovarian aging , as reflected by age at natural menopause , may be highly correlated to the aging of other tissues and to mortality produced by aging . " ' 3 One aim of medical science is the " compression of morbidity " into the final years of life . ' A more positive view is that science may delay the chronic diseases of old age long enough that people will die from old age , not from chronic diseases . Unfortunately , this is not yet occurring ; we are in a period of " expansion of old age morbidity . " ' 15-'x Since many of the degenerative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of these diseases . However , until people choose to lead healthier lifestyles , the result will continue to be high morbidity in the aged population.19 Since women live longer than men and experience more morbidity than men ( see Chapter 7 under Sex Ratio , Injury Responses , and Life Expectancy subsections. ) , it might be expected that they contribute disproportionately to the " expansion of old age morbidity . " This may be so , but the available data is conflicting . One large study of 10,000 men and women in three communities indicated that the longer surviving women were neither better off , nor worse off , than the men.2 ? But other surveys indicate that women show an excess of functional disability.2122 Data collated from studies done in the past decade from America , Europe , and the United Kingdom , which calculated disahility-free life expectancy . indicate that the average healthy life expectancy is 60 years for // men and 64 years for women . ' - ' Subtracting total life expectancy from disability-free life expectancy indicates that women can be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One pathologist has suggested that the cause of death in healthy oldsters be viewed as senescence rather than a specific disease . ' He views aging as " a universal , progressive decline in physiological function to the point where life can not be maintained in the face of otherwise trivial tissue injury . " ' " It seems less ghoulish to consider death in old age as the normal end to life , rather than a pathologic result . The normal physiologic accompaniments of aging are discussed in the remaining sections of this chapter in terms of race and sex differences . Body size , shape , and composition are covered first , followed by physical manifestations of aging . Then developmental differences , such as menopause and sensory changes , are described . Next , the adjustments to be used when looking at common health measurements are specified . A short section on disease susceptibility precedes the final section on prediction and promotion of longevity . BODY SIZE , SHAPE , AND COMPOSITION The major changes of old age are loss of height and bone density ; redistribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued growth of the skull and cartilage . LOSS OF HEIGHT AND BONE DENSITY Human beings lose height as they age because intervertebral discs become thinner and the height of the vertebral bodies decreases . ' 2H But not much height is lost in this way ? from 0.4 to 0.6 inch per decade for males and 0.4 to 0.7 inch per decade for females , starting in the sixth decade of life.29 Measuring the loss of height with age is complicated by a secular trend toward increased height.29-32 Long-term longitudinal studies are difficult because scientists grow older and lose interest in such research , as do the subjects . One longitudinal study of old men started with a cohort of 170 subjects ; 16 years later , only 22 men were available for study.33 In 16 years , the men lost an average of 0.6 inch in height , most of it through a decrease in their sitting height ? a measure of the length of the spine . The height decline appears to be similar for Blacks and Whites , while women decline in height more than men.34-37 Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose bone density . This loss , or osteoporosis , occurs in the cortical areas of long bones and is partially offset by increases in bone in the periosteal area . Consequently , long bones increase in diameter as their medullary space increases.38 4 ' This process helps maintain bone integrity as bony substance decreases . A physics principle helps explain this phenomenon : as the radius of a cylinder increases , the rigidity of the structure increases.3 " Problems can occur because of the increased diameter of the medullary cavity ; // for example , an individual with an old hip prosthesis may experience a loosening of the artificial hip at its attachment to the femur.42 Bone density loss is a normal aging process . But a few individuals , because of light bones or underlying pathology , incur enough bone loss as they age to reach such a point of bone fragility that fractures occur from little or no trauma . Since males have denser bones than females , women more often suffer the consequences of extensive osteoporosis than men.43-48 Because of the greater bone density of Blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of Whites.49 In the United States , vertebral fractures affect 17.1 per 10,000 White women per year , 9.9 White men , 3.7 Black Women , and 2.5 Black men.50 Hip fracture incidence is 13.9 per 10,000 for White women , 6.7 for Mexican American women , and 5.5 for Black women.51 For men , the figures are 4.9 ( White men ) , 2.6 ( Mexican American men ) , and 0.4 ( Black men ) . Mainland Japanese and Japanese Americans of both sexes have lower rates of hip fracture than White Americans.5 ' Hong Kong men and women also have lower rates of hip fracture than United States Whites.53 Women lose bony substance differently than men.4554-56 Men reach their maximum bone density in early adulthood , then slowly decline . Women reach their maximum bone density about 10 years later than men , maintain it until around the midforties , then experience a more rapid decline in density than men.57 The rapid decline in bone density that occurs in women may be due to aging , 39,58,59 rather than to menopause.450 Several factors besides gender protect against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black , having increased body fat , being tall , having an increased body mass index , working outdoors , doing heavy manual labor , and currently exercising.39 ' 56,57,61-67 In Europe the hip fracture rates vary more between communities than between sexes within communities , illustrating the importance of factors other than sex in bone density.6s Other factors relate to attaining high bone density early in life , which protects against severe bone loss later in life . These factors include participation in physical activity as a child and young adult , 69 7 ' and calcium consumption in childhood and early adulthood.71 ' 72 Current calcium consumption does not correlate strongly with bone density.73-75 Blacks have denser bones than Whites.57 ? 61 Whites may have denser bones than Chinese , Japanese , Eskimos , and some Native Americans ; 43,44,76,77 but the data are not as strong as those for Black/White comparisons . Since hip fracture rates in Mexican American women , 51 Japanese and Japanese Americans of both sexes , 53 and Eskimos are approximately half those of Whites , normal bone loss in these other groups apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case among Whites . One author postulated that the shorter and stockier body build of Eskimos , with their tendency to he big-honed in relation to body sire , may he the reason for their lower incidence of osteoporotic // fractures.43 This argument may hold for Mexican Americans and American Indians , but it is less persuasive for many Orientals . Genetics plays a part in Blacks ' resistance to osteoporosis . Blacks have diminished bone turnover rates compared to Whites ; 78 they excrete less calcium in their urine ; 79 and they also have higher circulating levels of calcitonin than Whites.80 Blacks show a later decrease in bone loss at the radius than do Whites , but a similar decrease in the vertebrae ; 57 the radius is not as affected by body mass as are vertebrae and other weight-bearing bones . These differences accompany a difference in calcium consumption ? Blacks consume less calcium than Whites.x ' -H ' - Pathologic osteoporosis is possible in Blacks , even though their risk is the lowest of any race . Races are not static entities ? United States Blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of osteoporosis present in Whites is also present , to a degree , in many Black women . Bone density values overlap in Black and White women ; 25 percent of Black women have bone density values below the mean of White women.57 One study of 360 Black and White women 24 to 65 years of age indicated that 5 percent of the Blacks and 17 percent of the Whites had vertebral bone densities below the theoretical fracture threshold.57 In addition , the risk factors of smoking74 and low body weightx4 can affect individuals of any race . WEIGHT CHANGES Body composition also changes with age , because individuals lose muscle and gain fat.85-R9 Muscle fiber atrophy occurs mainly in Type II fibers , with a proportional increase in Type I muscle fibers.9091 Loss of muscle results in thinner extremity circumferences , increased abdominal girth ( because of weaker abdominal muscles ) , 89.92 decreased strength ( more so in women ) , and decreased basal metabolic rate.93-97 Physical activity retards these changes.9H Evaluating weight change with age is difficult because of simultaneous muscle loss and fat gain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 50 years or so among both males and females.19 Extrapolations from cross-sectional data indicate that women gain weight steadily until about age 45 , then gain slightly until about 70 , when they begin to decline in weight . Menopause does not appear to have an effect on weight gain.100 Men gain weight rapidly until about age 30 , gain slightly until around age 50 , then begin a decline.99 ? 101 Men 's weights follow the gain and loss of muscle mass more closely than do women 's weights . Women put on most of their weight as fat . SKULL AND FACIAL CHANGES Head and face changes are similar in men and women . Skull bones and cartilage continue to grow with age ; the jawbone decreases in height but increases in width , and the earlobes and nose grow longer.107- ' 04 These changes // produce the distinctive head of the oldster that looks large in proportion to the rest of the body . Besides these changes , many aged individuals lose their teeth . Twenty-eight percent of persons between the ages of 65 and 74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in persons 75 years of age and older.1 ? 5 This brings the nose and chin into closer proximity . Better dental care received by younger generations should reduce the number of toothless old people in the future . BRAIN CHANGES Gray matter decreases with aging , beginning in the forties , with a concomitant increase in ventricular and related cerebrospinal fluid volume. ? " - ' 09 Males begin a steep increase in ventricular volume in their fifties ; a similarly steep increase for women is delayed until their sixties.108 Brain atrophy is greater in the left hemisphere for men ; in women brain atrophy is symmetrical.707 Intelligence test scores do not correlate with the decrease in gray matter.108 SURFACE MANIFESTATIONS Wrinkles and gray hair are usually the lay person 's first clues of aging . Gray hair correlates well ( r = .72 ) with age , and no significant differences in hair graying occur between the sexes.10 ' " ' But there are racial differences in the rate of hair graying . Whites gray notably faster than the other races . Specific studies to demonstrate this differential rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fair- and dark-haired individuals of unspecified race has been studied ; 66 percent of fair-haired individuals are fully white by age 60 , while only 37 percent of dark-haired persons are totally white by the same age . Wrinkles also correlate well ( r = .60 ) with age and differ among races . " ? Blacks , Orientals , American Indians , and Eskimos wrinkle later in life than Whites . ' 13-15 Light skin shows the effects of sun damage more than dark skin , whatever the given race , and sun-damaged skin shows aging effects more than protected skin . ' ' Health care providers often over- or underestimate age when dealing with clients from a race different from their own . Whites tend to underestimate the age of Black , Oriental , and American Indian clients ; Blacks , Orientals , and American Indians tend to overestimate the age of White clients . Dry skin , one of the more annoying surface manifestations of aging , is inevitable in individuals over 70 years of age . " ' In part , dry skin may be caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Blacks have a significantly higher transepidermal water loss than Whites , which correlates with stratum corneum water content . ' Age-related dry skin is not due to a lack of sebaceous gland activity . " " Sebaceous gland secretions decline with age , hut not until mound 80 years of // age in men . Women experience a slow decrease in sebaceous gland activity between 50 and 70 years of age , after which activity levels off . ' ' DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES Some body functions and measurements decrease with age , while others increase . As already noted , height and muscle mass both decrease . The jawbone shortens in height but increases in width ; the fingers grow longer , ' 22 ' 23 and both the skull and the abdomen increase in diameter . Reproductive function ceases in women . Some sensory changes occur , and some laboratory and clinical measures change . MENOPAUSE Disappearance of the reproductive function is marked by menopause , which occurs at the mean age of 50 years . ' 2- ' 24 There does not appear to be any racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences . Poor women and women from less-developed countries experience earlier menopause than financially better-off women . ' 25 ' ' 26 Fertility begins to decline at least 15 years before menopause . The decline is slight but statistically significant in the early thirties , and is marked after 35 years of age . ' " SENSORY CHANGES Vision One of the earlier signs of aging is the need for reading glasses or bifocals because eyes no longer focus over the full visual field . This occurs in the early forties for women and in the late forties to early fifties for men . ' 28 ' 29 Even before age 10 , individuals begin to lose focusing or accommodative power . By age 30 , focusing power has decreased by half , and it is down to 1 to 2 diopters by age 50.130 Color vision also deteriorates with aging , especially for green hues.131 ' 132 The decline is gradual , apparent even at 10 years of age . Both near and far vision decline with age , but near vision usually declines sooner ; few people over age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose accommodative power sooner than Whites.129 Far vision declines more slowly ; in fact , by age 65 , 10 percent of individuals still have 20/20 distant vision . Aging individuals , whose lenses have lost accommodative power , find it increasingly difficult to see in dim light.134 But bright light enhances visual acuity because pupil aperture decreases in bright light , allowing finer focus ? the depth of field is increased , as in the pin-hole camera effect . Functional impairment of the eyes increases with age , ' 35 , ' 36 affecting 7 percent of persons between ages 71 to 74 years , and 39 percent of persons 90 years of age and older . ' ' 6 Functional blindness ranges from I percent of persons hetween 71 and 74 years of age , to 17 percent of those age 90 or older . Blacks // have a twofold excess of blindness and visual impairment compared to Whites.137 Both conditions are negatively affected by socioeconomic conditions and disease , and thus are remediable . Visual acuity differences occur by race . Blacks have poorer corrected visual acuity than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Blacks and Whites . American Indians are comparable to Whites , while Japanese- and Chinese-Americans have the poorest corrected visual acuity. ' 38.139 The poor visual acuity of Japanese and Chinese is generally due to myopia . Oriental populations have long been noted to he myopic.140 In the past 60 years , myopia has also become common among Eskimos . ' 41.142 The relative newness of the condition in Eskimos , its general limitation to those under 60 years of age , and its increasing frequency in the younger age groups has led to it being labeled an epidemic.J41 Previous to the Eskimo epidemic of myopia , it was thought that huntergatherers and other groups with a short history of western-style development were less myopic than groups with a long history of such development because acute eyesight was considered necessary for survival in a hunting-gathering society . The increased number of myopes in highly developed populations was considered the result of a relaxed need for good eyesight . The one-generation change from normal to myopic vision in a significant proportion of Eskimos negates this theory . Now close indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 43.144 One study showed the myopic Eskimos attended school more regularly and for longer periods of time than their nonmyopic counterparts . ' " Myopes had no higher proportion of myopic relatives than normals , nor did they differ in height or weight ( the latter comparisons were done to eliminate the effects of growth differences ) . The tendency for myopia has been present in the Eskimo population all along , but conditions necessary for its development were not present until recently . Animal studies have confirmed the role of visual experience in producing myopia . ' 43.145 Hearing Hearing gradually declines with age , especially in the high frequencies . ' 416.147 The ability to hear speech sounds at 20 to 30 decibels declines in 18 percent of persons 55 to 64 years old , and in 33 percent of persons 65 to 74 years of age . ' 48 Over the age of 40 , men have poorer hearing than females.146 Blacks have better hearing at high and low frequencies , while Whites have better hearing at middle frequencies.148-'S0 Blacks appear to be less susceptible to noise-induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declines or remains the same for salt , sucrose , citric acid , and quinine sulfate . ' s ' ' ss When taste declines , the degree of decline is slight . The taste for citric acid , which remains the same with age . // shows a difference by sex : women can taste lower concentrations of it than men . ' S7 Smell The ability to smell certain odors declines with age in both sexes , but more so in males.154.156458 Odor perception is relatively stable up to the sixties ; then there is a decrease in perception for some odors.156- ' 58 For instance , recognition of sweet and fruity odors declines , and this may decrease food enjoyment in some older persons . The ability to recognize mercaptan. a compound added to natural gas as a warning , also declines . Women maintain their sense of smell better than men.156- ' 57 The sense of smell has lost importance in our over-deodorized and polluted world . Nevertheless , some individuals retain or perhaps train their sense of smell to inform them of their surroundings . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better sense of smell than males ( begining in early infancy ) , ' 54.156,157,159 that more Whites than Blacks can smell the odor of sweat , 160 that more Blacks than Whites can smell the odor of musk , 160 that infants can identify their mothers ' milk by smell , 16 ' ? 167 that infants and adults can identify individuals by smell , ' 61-163 and that adults can determine the sex of individuals by smell.161 Touch The sense of touch changes little , if at all , in older individuals . ' 64 , ' 65 Pain sensation declines somewhat . ' 66 , ' 67 The ability to feel vibrations decreases considerably . ' 65a6s. ' 69 None of these sensations has much effect on normal functioning . Different groups react differently to pain , but further study is needed on whether the differences are cultural or biological . In one large study of racial differences in pain tolerance , over 40,000 subjects of various races were subjected to standardized pressure on the Achilles tendon ( a measure of deep pain ) .770 Whites had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest tolerance . Men had higher pain tolerance than women . ' 7 ? - ' 73 When educational level was controlled , racial differences remained . A smaller study of cutaneous pain corroborated the Black/White differences in pain tolerance.174 Nerve conduction slows with aging . which probably accounts for the general slowing of pace and reaction time seen in some older persons . ' 65 , ' 75. ' 76 The more complex the task , the slower the reaction time to the initiation of the task.175 From an evolutionary standpoint , slowness of reaction can increase mortality from predators or accidents . GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION Gastrointestinal function does not decline with agc , 177 hut complaints of constipation ' ' ' and eas production ' " ' increase . Constipation , reported by // 24 percent of individuals over 65 years of age , may be caused by decreased physical activity.180 The cause of increased gas production is unclear , but increased fiber consumption to relieve constipation may be the culprit . CHANGES IN LABORATORY VALUES Reference values for many common laboratory measurements are not established for the elderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults and children , or blood donors . A few investigators have studied healthy old people , but the sample sizes are often small , and the findings often contradictory.187-188 Four blood tests are exceptions : hemoglobin , hematocrit , glucose , and cholesterol have been studied extensively in all ages . Hemoglobin and Hematocrit It is well established that healthy old persons have hemoglobin and hematocrit values within the range of younger persons . ' 84 , ' 87. ' 89. ' 9 " The sex difference in these blood values ( males have higher readings than females ) decreases slightly with aging . The racial difference in hemoglobin levels continues into old age ? Blacks have lower hemoglobin levels than Whites , but follow the same sex pattern . 183 , ' 89 , ' 90-193 Blood Glucose Another laboratory measurement well documented over the life span is blood glucose . Whether measured by glucose tolerance test or by glycosylated hemoglobin determination , blood glucose levels rise with age . ' 88 , ' 93-196 The mean blood glucose level , after a glucose challenge , rises from 99.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age to 166.3 mg per 100 ml at ages 75 to 79.197 Mean glycosylated hemoglobin determinations are 6.9 percent at ages 50 to 69 and rise to 8.62 percent at ages 80 to 89. ' 95 Women have higher blood glucose levels than men . This sex difference widens with age , being 9.5 mg per 100 ml at ages 18 to 24 and 24.1 mg per 100 ml at ages 75 to 79 years.197 There is also a racial difference : Blacks have slightly higher levels than Whites , but the difference is not apparent between individuals of similar socioeconomic status . Blood glucose levels in other groups in the United States ? American Indians , Hispanic Americans , and Japanese Americans ? are generally higher than White levels . But the difference is apparently due to environmental differences , specifically dietary components and exercise.198 2m Cholesterol and Lipoprotein Levels Data indicate that age and sex are major factors in cholesterol levels . Cholesterol levels rise with age in both men and women.188 but the patterns of increase differ.202 In men , peak levels occur between 45 and 54 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , levels continue to rise until around // 60 years of age , and then decline slightly . Up to the midforties or early fifties , men have higher cholesterol levels than women ; after that , women 's levels exceed those of men.187 United States Blacks and Whites have similar cholesterol levels , 20 ' but other population groups differ . Hispanic White Americans , 203 Pima Indians , 204 Solomon Islanders , ' 05 Nigerians , 206 and Asians ' ' - 07 all have lower cholesterol levels than United States Blacks or Whites . Lipoproteins also differ by race and sex . High density lipoprotein ( HDL ) levels are higher in women than in men , higher in Blacks than in Whites , similar or higher in Asians than in Whites , and lower in Mexican Americans than in Whites.207-211 The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL 's is higher in men than in women , and higher in Whites than in Blacks . ' - 08 ' 2 ' ' 2 Low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) levels vary little by gender , but differ by race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher LDL:HDL ratios than women , and Whites have higher ratios than Blacks.208 Because of differing cultures and food preferences , it is not possible to determine whether these cholesterol differences are genetic or related to lifestyle . CHANGES IN CLINICAL MEASURES Pulse Pulse rate is one of the more common measurements that differs by sex , but not by race or age . Females have higher pulses than males at all ages , ' 214 usually 5 to 10 beats per minute . Pulse rate does not decline with age , whether measured longitudinally or cross-sectionally.2 ' 4-216 Blood Pressure Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rise with age in the United States and most developed countries , 217 but not so in some less-developed countries.218- " 0 The increase in blood pressure that occurs when a group moves from a rural ( or traditional ) environment to more urban ( or less traditional ) surroundings is well-documented . ' ' ' ' " Consequently , the age rise in blood pressure is apparently environmentally rather than genetically programmed . The rise in blood pressure with age , when it occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lower systolic pressures than men before 45 years of age and higher systolic pressures after 65 years . From 45 to 65 years of age , systolic pressure does not differ substantially between the sexes . Men have higher diastolic pressures than women from 18 through 64 years of age . but at about 65 years , diastolic pressures do not differ between the sexes . In the only two well-studied racial comparisons , United States Black men have lower systolic pressures than White men from ages 18 to 34 ; from ages 35 to 64 Blacks ' systolic pressures exceed those of White men ; and after age 65 systolic pressure does not differ by race for men . ' 17 Black women have higher systolic and diastolic pressures at every age compared with White women . // Blacks have an average blood pressure reading 5 mm Hg higher than Whites ? less at younger ages , more at older ages.223 Black women over age 45 have blood pressure readings as much as 16 mm higher than White women in the same age group . At face value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could indicate a genetic difference between Blacks and Whites related to blood pressure regulation . But several other variables are involved that exaggerate these differences : education and income level , amount and distribution pattern of body fat , sodium intake , time of day of measurement , stress . and degree of acculturation to Westernized society . 219,220.224-230 Systolic blood pressures are lower in sub-Sahara African Blacks than in Blacks from the northern area of the Western hemisphere . And urban Blacks in Africa and the Western hemisphere have higher pressures than rural Blacks in either area.231 In addition , a secular trend toward a decrease in blood pressure is occurring in the United States . ' ' 7 ' 22 ' It has not been satisfactorily determined how much of the Black-White blood pressure difference is due to nongenetic factors . For example , stress occurs for many reasons , but the stress incurred during a physical examination was measured in one of the National Health Surveys by looking at the fall in blood pressure that took place between the first and third measurement.224 Blood pressure decreased in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point more than in Whites . This explains one of the five points that differentiate the mean blood pressures of the two races . If all the variables were considered , blood pressure differences might disappear . Until such studies are done , a racial difference can be suspected , but its magnitude can not be substantiated . Other types of data support the notion that genetics plays a role in determining blood pressure level . Blood pressure correlates positively with skin color232.233 and other markers of Black admixture.234.235 Blacks also have lower urinary and sweat sodium excretion rates than Whites , as well as more salt-sensitive hypertension.236-239 There is evidence that melanin acts as a reservoir for cations like sodium , potassium , calcium , lead , copper , and cadmium.240 The reservoir effect of melanin could explain the increased sodium reserve of Blacks and others with dark skin , and could also help explain their resistance to osteoporosis . This cation reserve might also explain the rise in blood pressure in developing countries with increased exposure to lead , copper , and cadmium ( all these heavy metals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSCEPTIBILITY One definition of aging refers to an increasing vulnerability to disease and other bodily insults in aging individuals.24 This viewpoint supports separation of the causes of disease and disability in older individuals into four categories . // The first category includes diseases that occur in varying degrees in all aging individuals . Atherosclerosis is a good example : it is universal and progressive , and it inevitably proves fatal if a more specific disease or injury does not intervene first . The second category includes diseases that are not universal but increase in incidence with age , such as diabetes , neoplasms , and heart disease . The third category includes diseases and bodily insults that affect people of all ages , but have more serious consequences in older persons , such as accidents and influenza . The fourth category includes nondisease causes of death , such as homicide . Of the ten leading causes of death in the United States , six are in the category of diseases that increase in incidence with age : heart disease ( the leading cause ) , malignant neoplasms ( second ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth ) , diabetes ( seventh ) , and chronic liver disease ( ninth ) .24 ' Two of the ten leading causes are in the category of diseases with more serious consequences in the aged : accidents ( fourth ) and pneumonia and influenza ( sixth ) . Finally , two are in the category of nondisease causes of death : suicide ( eighth ) and homicide and legal intervention ( tenth ) . None of the top ten causes of death are in the category of diseases that occur in all aging individuals . Atherosclerosis , which fits this category , comes in thirteenth and accounts for less than 1 percent of all deaths . The three leading causes ( heart disease , cancer , and cerebrovascular disease ) account for 64 percent of all deaths.241 Comparisons can be made between groups by looking at the years of potential life lost ( YPLL ) before age 65 . This measure " gives a more accurate picture of premature mortality by weighing deaths occurring at younger ages more heavily than those occurring at older ages . ' ' " 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by American Indians and Alaskan Natives , Hispanics , non-Hispanic Whites , and Asians and Pacific Islanders ( who have the least premature mortality ) . Socioeconomic status complicates mortality rates ? since 1960 the disparity in mortality between income and educational levels has widened . ' 43 In all groups , females incur less premature mortality than males . Since Chapter 5 covers disease , osteoarthritis is the only disease condition connected with aging that will be considered here . OSTEOARTHRITIS Osteoarthritis in the hands and feet affects 85 percent of people 75 to 79 years of age , as opposed to only 4 percent of those ages 18 to 24. ' 44 Before age 45 , men have a higher incidence of osteoarthritis than women . But after age 55 , women have a higher incidence than men.244,245 Women have a more general involvement of all joints than men . ' 46247 Osteoarthritis increases sharply after 40 years of age . The highest prevalence rates for radiological osteoarthritis in persons age 20 years and older are observed in the cervical spine ( men 85 // percent and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( men 64 percent and women 76 percent ) , and lumbar spine ( men 72 percent and women 67 percent ) . ' " Data on racial differences are limited . Black and White men appear to be similarly affected by osteoarthritis , but Black women have more osteoarthritis than White women.244 ' 24a Data on other groups are lacking . but National Health Survey results suggest that Orientals and American Indians have less osteoarthritis in the hands and feet than Blacks and Whites : 44 Heavy joint use and severe stress to specific joints are probably more important than race , and possibly more important than gender , in explaining the presence and severity of osteoarthritis . The disease is more prevalent in heavy individuals than in normal-weight persons.248 250 Osteoarthritis occurs more often in men who work at heavy manual labor than in men with less physically demanding jobs.249 A study of skeletal remains of four racial groups ? modern Blacks and Whites and protohistoric Pima Indians and Eskimos ? indicated that osteoarthritic involvement of particular joints correlated well with the types of physical activities engaged in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , persons over 60 years of age will constitute 17 percent of the population in the United States . This segment of the population is growing and living longer than previously.252 But significant physiological heterogeneity is seen in older individuals , more so than in younger individuals.253 54 A good portion of this heterogeneity is the result of lifestyle choices , specifically engaging in adequate physical activity and eating moderately . " The genetic equipment of man , which determines the evolutional advantages and function of different metabolic processes ... is conservative .... " 255 Humankind evolved a body designed to expend physical energy in the achievement of adequate food and shelter . Dietary and lifestyle changes within the past few generations are taxing this genetic equipment . Medical science has had , and will continue to have , little impact on lowering death rates in the United States , because 6 of the 15 leading causes of death ( or 65 percent of deaths ) are related to physical activity and diet.15 ' 256 Thus the next major advance in health will be determined by what individuals are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to devise a test battery to determine physiologic age as opposed to calendar age . The tests consist of several discrete biological and psychological measurements thought to indicate good functioning . For instance , the mean blood pressure , reaction time , and skin elasticity values for specific age groups are calculated . An individual 's measurements are then compared with the age standards . Several of these tests correlate very well with calendar age.259 ' 2 " " while others correlate with indicators of good functioning . ' ' ' ' Such tests could he useful for predicting longevity , for evaluating // exercise and dietary prescriptions , and for assessing environmental hazards that might reduce life expectancy.258 261 Laboratory testing is probably not necessary , however , because physicians ' uninstructed , visual inspection and estimation of age compare closely with the more complicated age prediction tests . ' -6 ' Both visual estimation of age and the more complicated tests for age prediction are closely correlated with mortality . Individuals who look or measure older than their actual age die sooner than those who look or measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated or predicted to be younger than their actual age are physically more active than those who look or measure older . Although the roles of physical exercise , diet , and other health maintenance practices into old age are not completely understood , many reports suggest such influences . One explanation for the beneficial effects of these health practices is the positive association of natural killer cell activity with body weight , daily work load , intake of green vegetables , protein consumption , alcohol consumption , regularity of meals , and regularity of sleep ; and the negative association of natural killer cell activity with smoking.263 Another explanation relates to the effect of exercise ? it produces endogenous pyrogens which temporarily raise body temperature and thus may protect individuals from bacterial disease.264 265 People who include fairly vigorous physical activity in their lifestyles are healthier and live longer than their more sedentary age peers.26o ' 270 This association between exercise status , health , and mortality is well established , but evidence that it is causal is not as clear . Longitudinal studies are necessary to answer this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of physical exercise on men indicates that the prolongation of life that results from a physically active lifestyle is around two years.271 An offspin of this same longitudinal study indicates that sedentary men who increase their level of activity have a 15 percent lower death rate than men who continue sedentary lifestyles.27 ' Middle-aged and older individuals who initiate and continue regular physical exercise benefit by improved health.273-276 Physical exercise decreases the risk of hypertension , obesity , and osteoporosis , and increases self-esteem.277 Improved health , even if it does not result in a longer life , is a worthwhile goal in itself . Although less clear-cut than the role of exercise , the role of diet in increasing health and promoting longevity is extensively documented . People who eat breakfast daily and refrain from habitual snacks are healthier than those who skip breakfast and snack between meals.266,266 Moderate alcohol drinkers and alcohol abstainers are healthier than people who drink heavily . 266,278-280 Coffee drinkers have higher cholesterol levels than tea drinkers . ' ' ' Overweight individuals are less healthy than their thinner cohorts . ' T ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases of aging ? diabetes , hypertension , osteoporosis , atherosclerosis , loss of renal function , cognitive impairment , and joint degeneration ? are caused partly by nutritional inadequacies . Dietary inadequacies in early and middle adulthood predispose individuals to disease in their older years . Excess calories , protein , and fat . as well as low intakes of complex carbohydrates and essential micronutrients , characterize many adult diets in industrialized populations : 84 Dietary controversies and fads related to cholesterol , fiber. complex carbohydrates , and the like are well-known . Until science settles these matters , people can and should eat as they wish , with moderation . Since so many diverse cuisines have evolved with different basic foodstuffs that adequately support life , there is hope that the current morbid concern over dangerous food items and patterns will abate . Intellectual activity , like physical activity , is also strongly correlated with health and longevity. - 85 ' - 87 People who are more physically active are also more intellectually active , scoring higher than inactive people on measures of cognition and mental processing speed . SUMMARY This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of data available on healthy aging is sparse compared to the abundance of data on sickly aging . Health care providers and researchers should put more effort into helping the healthy elderly stay healthy . As far as we know now , the best way to ensure that people live a long life ? really live , not just exist ? is to encourage them to be physically and mentally active , to eat on a regular schedule , to not overeat or overindulge in alcohol , and to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night . If people want to look younger , they need to be born to Black , Oriental , or Native American parents rather than White parents , because Whites turn gray and wrinkle sooner . As people age , they get a little shorter and somewhat broader around the middle . They lose some muscle and bone mass , but do not weigh much less until their sixties ( males ) or seventies ( females ) because of a gain in fat . Their eyes lose ability to accommodate , so glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their hearing , ability to savor good food , and sense of touch and pain . From the wear and tear of life , they usually incur some joint stiffness ( osteoarthritis ) and some atherosclerosis , but are not incapacitated . They may become more susceptible to chronic and infectious diseases , but can often avoid these by maintaining healthy habits . With some luck and good planning , they may die of old age before anything worse comes along to end their lives . Chapter 5 BIOCHEMICAL VARIATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY Why discuss biochemical variation and disease susceptibility in the sal chapter , and why discuss disease in a hook on normal biologic variation ? ' answer the first question , the more we learn about specific diseases , the me molecular our knowledge becomes . For instance , hypertension may be relat to the amount of melanin in the skin . It is postulated that melanin acts reserve for sodium and for heavy metals like lead , copper , and cadmium , whi are implicated in the causation or exacerbation of hypertension . ' In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; disease occurs often enough in humans to be part of normal life , and ma diseases show racial variation . Of the diseases that differ by racial group , or those that affect large numbers of people are covered in this chapter : cane diabetes , hypertension and heart disease , tooth decay , and the like . This chap also examines biochemical or enzymatic variations that occur among differ ( races and that are of some health concern , such as lactose intolerance , cliff ( ential drug metabolism , and malaria-related blood and enzyme types . Caution should be used when interpreting disease pattern differences t tween racial groups , because the variations may be due to factors other th genetics . Socioeconomic , demographic , and environmental variables contri ute to what may appear to be racial differences . Certain groups may be young or poorer or have less access to health care . Climate , diet , drug use , a exercise can also make a difference . Because it is sometimes difficult distinguish genetically based differences from nongenetic variations , cliff ( ences now thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by somethi else . BIOCHEMICAL VARIANTS As we learn more about the molecular basis of disease . the list of biochemical variants will grow . Drug metabolism differences , lactose intolerance , a malaria-related conditions ( sickle cell disease , thalassemia , glucose-6-phc phate dehydrogenase deficiency . Duffy blood group ) are examined in this section . DIFFERENTIAL DRUG METABOLISM Individuals of various races differ in their reactions to several drugs in chemicals . These differences may be attributed to genetics or to environment influences such as foods , food preparation methods , and tobacco smoking . // A few of the racial differences in drug response may be the result of natural selection , wherein a food substance has effects similar to those of a drug . But most differential drug responses are probably caused by random genetic drift of neutral mutations . ' Four drugs , or xenobiotics , and one drug group are covered in detail in this section . Other xenobiotics that show response differences by race are listed in Table 5.1 .

' // Ethanol Many Orientals and some American Indians experience marked facial flushing and other vasomotor symptoms after drinking alcohol , while most Whites do not.4 These observations led to the discovery of the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism . Alcohol is metabolized in the liver to acetaldehyde mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ) ; then the acetaldehyde is metabolized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) .4,5 Both the ADH and ALDH have variant forms . High-activity variants of the ADH enzyme convert alcohol to acetaldehyde quickly , while low-activity variants convert it slowly . Of the four ALDH varieties ( ALDH1 through ALDH4 ) , ALDH1 is considered " normal " ; the other three variants are " deficient " in the ability to oxidize acetaldehyde . The oxidation of acetaldehyde is delayed in people deficient in the ALDH enzyme . High acetaldehyde levels produce many of the symptoms of alcohol sensitivity , including facial flushing and other vasomotor symptoms . Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Indians are ALDHdeficient , whereas less than 5 percent of North American Indians , Whites , and Blacks are deficient.5-7 Isoniazid Isoniazid , a drug used to treat tuberculosis , is inactivated rapidly or slowly depending on an individual 's phenotype . ' Slow acetylation phenotype individuals are prone to developing peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity during isoniazid therapy . ' These individuals are also prone to suffer toxic reactions from dapsone , hydralazine , phenelzine , sulfamaprine , and sulfamethazine . Because of the possibility of neuropathy , pyridoxine is routinely given with isoniazid to nullify its toxic effect . When isoniazid doses are spaced at long intervals , slow inactivators respond better to therapy than do rapid inactivators.10 Slow inactivation of isoniazid occurs in approximately 60 percent of Whites and Blacks , 10 to 40 percent of American Indians and Eskimos ( depending on the tribe ) , and 10 to 20 percent of Orientals.10 " Phenylthiocarbamide Phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) , a chemical substance that tastes bitter to some people and is tasteless to others , is present in plants of the cabbage family ( Brassica genus ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brassica group of vegetables tastes bitter.12 In areas of the world where people have low iodine intakes , brassica plants are goitrogenic foods . It is thought that people who can taste the bitterness of such foods will avoid them and thus protect themselves from nodular goiters . ' ' But other factors like dietary convention may also be involved ? women who could taste PTC used only two of seven tested Brassica genus vegetables significantly less often than nontaster women . ' ' // Because iodized salt is used in the United States , the incidence of preventable goiters is not high , but in other areas of the world the problem still exists ? the prevalence of goiter is 31 percent in school children and 19 percent in household members in Ethiopia . ' ' Ecuadoran children in an endemic goiter area who could taste PTC had better neurologic maturation scores than those who could not taste it.15 PTCtaster children may have avoided goitrogenic foods and thus avoided stress to their thyroid glands ; this would explain the differences in neurologic development between tasters and nontasters . Populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of Whites and 94 percent of Blacks can taste PTC . Orientals and American Indians have intermediate frequencies of tasters . " Succinylcholine The enzyme pseudocholinesterase inactivates succinylcholine , a muscle relaxant used in surgery . The drug is inactivated rapidly by most individuals , but individuals with an atypical form of the enzyme suffer prolonged muscular paralysis and an inability to breathe without mechanical help for several hours after administration of the drug . Blacks , Orientals , and American Indians are at very low risk of having an atypical form of pseudocholinesterase . Whites are at a slightly higher risk ( 1 out of 2500 ) . A few smaller groups ? Ashkenazic Jews and Alaskan Eskimos ? are at considerably greater risk . ' 6-18 For instance , one out of every 135 southwestern Alaskan Eskimos is unable to metabolize succinylcholine normally . Pseudocholinesterase is an autosomal recessive gene.9 Individuals from populations at risk for this enzyme defect should be tested for possible deficiency before surgery . Antihypertensives Blacks and Whites generally respond differently to antihypertension medications . Blacks respond better to diuretics than Whites , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ACE ) inhibitors.19 Salt-handling ( diuretics ) and plasma renin activity ( beta blockers and ACE ) differences between the races are the postulated causes of these differences . LACTOSE INTOLERANCE The inability to digest lactose is one of the better-known conditions that correlate with race . Lactose-intolerant individuals may experience gastrointestinal symptoms when they ingest milk or milk products . Symptoms are dose dependent ? the more milk ingested , the more severe the symptoms ; and symptoms are less severe when milk is taken as part of a meal , rather than alone . ' " Many lactose-intolerant individuals can ingest the equivalent of an 8 ounce class of milk with meals without experiencing symptoms . // Bloating , flatulence , and cramps are the common symptoms associated with lactose intolerance . Diarrhea occurs less commonly ; it is associated with ingestion of large amounts of milk ? something a lactose-intolerant individual usually avoids . In lactose-intolerant individuals lactose is not metabolized . Unmetabolized lactose is subject to bacterial action in the intestines , and this produces gas . Lactose has a relatively high osmotic action : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motility and causing diarrhea . Symptoms are easily alleviated by avoiding or decreasing the amount of milk or milk products . Lactose is water soluble ; hence , milk whey contains most of the lactose 2 ? Cheesemaking removes whey and converts much of the remaining lactose to lactic acid . Whole and skim milk , nonfat and whole dry milk , buttermilk , and whey are high in lactose . Condensed milk and evaporated milk contain about one-fourth the lactose of regular milk . Yogurt , cottage cheese , ice cream , sherbet , butter , cream , and sour cream contain about one-tenth the lactose of regular milk . Highly susceptible lactose-intolerant individuals should pay close attention to food labels , since many packaged foods ? processed meats , cake mixes , canned soups , instant potatoes , salad dressings , and canned and frozen fruits ? contain lactose that was added in processing . Lactose intolerance is inherited as a highly penetrant , autosomal , dominant characteristic . ' ' -0 Much of the confusion about its inheritance is caused by variability in the age at appearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two periods when symptoms of lactose intolerance are first noted ? shortly after weaning and during midchildhood.21-24 Lactose intolerance after childhood is the more common of the two . ' ? The majority of the world 's population are lactose intolerant . The ability to digest lactose after childhood is made possible by a mutation that occurs mainly in individuals of Northern and Central European ancestry and in individuals from some Middle Eastern populations . Approximately 90 percent of Orientals and African Blacks , 75 to 80 percent of American Indians and American Blacks , 50 percent of Mexican Americans , and 15 percent of American Whites are lactose intolerant . A selective advantage ? that of ingesting milk as an available source of calcium and protein ? has been postulated as the reason for the spread of the mutation that causes lactose tolerance after weaning.25 ' 6 But since many lactose-intolerant individuals can drink the equivalent of an 8-ounce glass of milk with impunity , and since most milk products that were available before the advent of refrigeration had diminished lactose content ( cheeses and soured milk ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageous . " MALARIA-RELATED CONDITIONS Malaria has brought about the evolutionary development of several hemoglobin and enzyme variants . These variants spread in the tropical and subtropical parts of ' the world in response to the severe stress of ncdaria . ' ' Although // they do provide some protection from malaria , they also produce some less advantageous effects . Four of the more common malaria-related variants ? sickle cell hemoglobin. thalassemia , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( G6PD ) , and the Duffy blood group ? are described in this section . Sickle Cell Hemoglobin Sickle cell hemoglobin is the best known condition related to malaria . Sickle cell homozygotes ? those who have inherited the sickle gene from both parents ? often die during childhood . Normal homozygotes ? those with two normal hemoglobin genes ? develop full-blown cases of falciparum malaria when they are infected . Heterozygotes ? those with one normal and one sickle cell gene ? have less severe cases of falciparum malaria . In the United States , sickle cell heterozygotes live as long as normal homozygotes ; apparently longevity is not affected , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought that , as the malaria parasite attempts to reproduce in heterozygous individuals , cells with the sickle defect are destroyed before the parasite 's reproduction is complete , thus reducing the parasite load . Infected cells sickle and are then eliminated from circulation by phagocytosis.30 Blacks have the highest prevalence of the sickle cell gene of any group ? approximately 7 to 9 percent of American Blacks and up to 50 percent of African Blacks have the gene.31-33 American Blacks have a lower incidence of the gene than African Blacks , partly because of the admixture of White genes , and partly because there is no longer an advantage for the heterozygote in the United States , since malaria has been virtually eliminated . Although Blacks have a higher prevalence of the sickle cell gene than other races , individuals from the Middle East , India , and Southern Europe also have the gene because of malaria in their ancestral areas.28 Modifier genes affect the severity of sickle cell disease.3s,34 Severe disease is more prevalent in Black populations.3536 The presence of less severe disease in non-Black populations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the misconception that sickle cell anemia affects Blacks exclusively . Thalassemia Thalassemia is another malaria-related genetic condition that results in various degrees of anemia . The clinical symptoms result from a defect in the rate of synthesis of normal hemoglobin , rather than from the production of an abnormal variant . The severity of this condition varies , depending on whether the defect is on the alpha or beta chain of the hemoglobin molecule , and depending on which type of defect occurs on the chain . ' ' Heterozygotes for any of the thalassemia varieties have mild ( if any ) clinical signs of anemia , but homozygotes may die of severe anemia . Like sickle cell hemoglobin , thalassemia is prevalent in areas where malaria is common . It is thought to protect heterozygotes front severe malaria illness . // The incidence of thalassemia is particularly high in the Mediterranean region , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia . Italy has a 7 to 15 percent incidence.38 Greece , India , Sudan , Turkey , Israel , and West Africa all have high frequencies , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The condition is rare in Japanese people.40 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) Deficiency This enzyme deficiency , which can occur in people from areas where malaria is common , affects around 10 percent of the world 's population . " Because of migration , G6PD deficiency is widespread . G6PD is X-linked ; therefore , problems related to the deficiency occur mostly in males in lowfrequency areas but can occur in females in high-frequency areas like Sardinia and Thailand . " The deficiency occurs in Blacks , Orientals , and Mediterranean groups . Heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency ( females only ) with dual red cell populations are the most fit genotype when they are infected with falciparum malaria . " ' " Hemizygote males and homozygote females may have some protection from malaria , but evidence is conflicting and incomplete . ' The G6PD locus is highly polymorphic , containing over 320 alleles . " The degree of deficiency of G6PD varies by genotype . Because there are so many alleles and possible combinations , classification of deficiency is based on clinical expression , ranging from class I ( very severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to class II ( severe enzyme deficiency ) , to class III ( moderate to mild deficiency ) , to class IV ( normal enzyme ) , to class V ( increased enzyme ) .41 Individuals who are G6PD-deficient experience hemolytic anemia when they ingest certain drugs or fava beans , when they contract bacterial or viral diseases which release toxins , and when they are exposed to naphthalene ( present in mothballs ) and possibly other chemicals.41 ' 43 The following substances may cause severe hemolytic anemia in G6PDdeficient persons : analgesics ( e.g. , aspirin , phenacetin ) , sulfonamides and sulfones , antimalarials ( e.g. , primaquine , atabrine ) , antibacterials ( e.g .. nitrofurantoin , chloramphenicol , para-aminosalicylic acid ) , vitamin K , probenecid , and quinidine . Over 30 drugs are known to cause anemia in G6PDdeficient individuals . ' ' Duffy Blood Group A particular blood type , Duffy negative , protects individuals against vivax malaria without " costing " anything . It does not cause death in homozygotes , nor does it produce anemia . African Blacks are almost exclusively Duffy negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admixture with Whites ) ; other groups in malaria areas , Algerians , for instance , have intermediate frequencies of Duffy negative . The rest of the world 's populations are mostly Duffy positive . ' ' . ' ' ' // Duffy positive red blood cells have receptors on their surfaces for vivax malaria parasites , while Duffy negative cells lack these receptors.47 ' 48 Hence individuals who are Duffy negative do not get vivax malaria when they are exposed to the parasite . ' ' DIFFERENTIAL DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY Racial comparisons for diseases can be made by considering the years of potential life lost ( YPLL ) before age 65 for individual causes of death.50 The YPLL measure " gives a more accurate picture of premature mortality by weighing deaths occurring at younger ages more heavily than those occurring at older ages . " 51 ( See Table 5.2 . ) For the top ten causes of death , the YPLL for Blacks of both sexes exceeds all other races for diabetes , heart disease and stroke , homicide , and pneumonia or influenza . YPLL 's for American Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents , cirrhosis , and suicide . That of Black males and White females exceeds all others for chronic obstructive lung disease , colorectal cancer , and lung cancer . That of Black females exceeds all others for breast cancer . // The YPLL for 7 of the top 10 causes of death is lowest or ties for lowest in Asians and Pacific Islanders . Only for cancer ( breast , lung , and colon ) , homicide , and suicide is another group lower . Hispanics of both sexes are lowest for colorectal and lung cancer , and tie for lowest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Hispanic females are lowest for suicide , and tie for lowest for stroke . American Indians and Alaskan Natives females are lowest for breast cancer . Whites are lowest for homicide . Persons of low socioeconomic status have increased mortality rates compared with persons of high socioeconomic status . The disparity in mortality rates by socioeconomic status has increased in the last 30 years.5 " - Four of the top ten causes of death ? those with a strong genetic or biological component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes , heart disease , and stroke . Also covered will be nonfatal diseases that affect races differentially : gallbladder disease , glaucoma , hereditary polymorphic light eruption , multiple sclerosis , periodontal disease , and tooth decay . Several of the diseases mentioned in this section are " diseases of overabundance " ? diabetes , heart disease , hypertension , gallbladder disease , and tooth decay . These diseases are relative newcomers to the list of human ailments ; they were not present in earlier times when people ate differently and led more physically active lives . Diseases of overabundance are generally preventable . Several of these diseases are related to obesity ? diabetes , hypertension , and gallbladder disease . Two are interrelated ? diabetes ( insulin resistance ) and hypertension.53 The number of heart disease , stroke , and atherosclerosis deaths is declining in the United States , 54 possibly as a result of improved diets and more exercise , as well as earlier diagnosis and better treatment.55 58 Contrariwise , diabetes deaths are rising ; 54 why this is so is not readily apparent , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising diabetes rates in American Indians , Alaskan Natives , and Hispanic Americans , 59-61 as they modify their previously healthy diets and lifestyles , may play a part in rising diabetes death rates , but this does not explain the rising rates of diabetes in American Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites . " - Perhaps the increased rate of cardiovascular disease in diabetics63.64 is affecting death rate statistics because diabetes rather than heart disease may be listed as the cause of death . CANCER Several types of cancer appear to vary by race , but a closer look often indicates that diet or another environmental factor is a better predictor than race . Examples of cancers associated with environmental variables that mimic racial variation are mentioned in this section , along with a few cancers that show racial differences for which environmental factors have not been implicated . Breast Cancer Age-adjusted death rates for breast cancer show that Blacks have the highest rate , 32.7 , followed closely by non-Hispanic Whites at 30.7 ; then by Hispanics // at 16.6 . American Indians and Alaskan Natives are similar to Asians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacks have a lower survival rate after diagnosis than other races , but when women with localized cancer ( with or without lymph node involvement ) are compared , there are no differences by race.65.67 The differences in disease survival rates may be caused by nutritional factors , 68 differences in stage at diagnosis , 69 and treatment.7 " Migrants to the United States have higher rates of breast cancer than persons from their country of origin.71 ' 72 Diet , 73.77 physical inactivity , 78 body weight during adolescence , 79 stature and frame size , 80 early menarche , 81 late menopause , ' " and numerous factors related to childbearing ( breastfeeding , 8 ' number of full-term pregnancies , ' " and never being pregnant81 ) are also positively associated with breast cancer . These variables often change after migration . Women with dry ear wax have a lower incidence of breast cancer than those with wet ear wax.83 Most Orientals and Native Americans have dry ear wax , while most Blacks and Whites have wet ear wax . The association of ear wax type and breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear canal and the breast are both apocrine glands , and their secretions are similar.83 Breast cancer rates in Japanese women with wet ear wax are twice those of Japanese women with dry ear wax.83 Prostate Cancer While prostate cancer rates differ dramatically between Blacks and Whites , the differences are not racial . Formerly Blacks had lower rates than Whites ; now their rates are higher and are still rising.84-86 A meticulous investigation into the annual age-specific mortality rates for prostate cancer in Blacks has demonstrated that these rates peaked in men who were born between 1896 and 1900.84 Before this time the mortality rates had increased steadily , and after this time the rates began to decline slowly . No such pattern was seen in White men . Some unknown variable that became more frequent before 1896 ? 1900 and less frequent thereafter produced the pattern in Blacks . Migration also affects prostate cancer rates . Cubans born in the United States have lower rates than Cubans living in Cuba.87 Japanese in the United States have higher rates than occur in Japan.7-The amount of saturated fat in the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency of intercourse , 88 and the lack of circumcision " are implicated as risk factors for prostate cancer . Skin Cancer Susceptibility to all types of skin cancers is related to the amount and distribution of melanin in the skin and to solar ultraviolet exposure.89-9- Skin cancer is less common in Blacks than in Whites , and in dark-skinned , darkhaired individuals than in light-skinned , light-haired individuals.94.91 There arc some differences among races in the types and locations of various skin cancers . For Whites the most common skin cancer is basal-cell // carcinoma.95 For Blacks the most common skin cancer is squamous-cell carcinoma.96-98 Melanoma is not a common cancer , but when it occurs , it is much more frequent in Whites than in Blacks or Japanese.99 ? 100 The incidence of melanoma is increasing in the United States and elsewhere , especially in Whites.9 " 01 The chance of survival after diagnosis is generally poor , but when melanoma is discovered early , survival is similar and good for both Blacks and Whites . ' ' ' ' Blacks and Japanese predominantly develop melanomas on the palmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , whereas Whites develop lesions most often on sun-exposed surfaces.99,10 ? Digestive Track Cancer Cancers of the esophagus , stomach , and colon are distributed geographically across distinct areas of high and low frequency . These areas generally involve specific racial groups , but environmental factors more than genetic factors are implicated in digestive cancer causation.703 Migration to the United States lowers the risk of stomach and esophagus cancer and increases the risk of colon cancer ? ' Research has determined several substances that are cancer-promoting . High-fat , high-meat diets are the major promoters of digestive tract cancer.76 ' ' 04-106 Smoking is a close contender , especially when combined with high alcohol consumption . The consumption of smoked , salted , and pickled foods also increases the risk of esophageal and stomach cancer.75 Eating fruits and vegetables protects against cancer.75 ' 107 The evidence for environmental factors in digestive tract cancers is now so strong that racial variation is not seriously considered . Gallbladder Cancer In the United States , gallbladder cancer is much higher in American Indians than in other races.10 " - ' The risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White women are higher , at 11.5 ; American Indian women have the highest rate , at 46.4.10 Hispanics have a higher rate than non-Hispanic Whites . " ' These rate differences are presumably related to the higher incidence of gallbladder disease in American Indians and Hispanics as compared with Whites ? gallstone size is positively related to gallbladder cancer . " 2 DIABETES Diabetes rates differ by race and are increasing worldwide.73 Diabetes is more common in females and in persons from low socioeconomic and educational levels.14 United States Blacks have a higher age-standardized diabetes prevalence ( 10.2 percent ) than non-Hispanic Whites ( 6.4 percent ) .13 ? " 5 Hispanics vary according to subgroup : Cubans are at 9.3 percent , Mexican Americans at 13 percent , and Puerto Ricans at 13.4 percent.1f Over the past 30 years , // Hispanic mortality rates have increased by 112 percent for females and 140 percent for males compared to non-Hispanic Whites.17 The combined rate of diabetes for American Indians and Alaskan Natives is over twice the rate for the United States population as a whole , 18 and their mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent for females and 249 percent for males . ' ' 7 Specific American Indian and Alaskan Native groups have diabetes rates ranging from 355 per 1000 in Pimas , 290 per 1000 in Cherokees , 172 per 1,000 in Navajos. 1 19 per 1000 in Plains Indians , 27.2 per 1000 in Aleuts , to 8.8 per 1,000 in Eskimos.19-122 Diabetes rates are rising in such diverse groups as Asian Indians , ' ' -3 Australian Aborigines , ' 24 Chinese , ' 20 Eskimos , 59 mainland and migrant Japanese , ' ' o5 and Polynesians. ' ' 6 These rate increases derive primarily from environmental causes rather than from biological differences . Dietary change is a major culprit . Obesity and the degree of " westernization " ( a rough measure of diet and other factors ) are also related to diabetes susceptibility. ' 26-132 ' Age-adjusted death rates for diabetes are highest for American Indian and Alaskan Native females . at 36 per 100.000 , followed by Black females , at 31.1 . The lowest rates are in Asian and Pacific Islander males and females ( 12.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates are positively associated with diabetes , while diets high in complex carbohydrates are negatively associated with it.133-137 High-fat diets and diets high in animal protein are also positively associated with diabetes , although the fat content of the animal protein is probably more important than the protein source.125,133,135137 For example , in one study Australian Aborigines , who temporarily reverted to their native diet ( which was low in fat and consisted of a large proportion of protein from wild animals ) , improved their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.133 Typical western diets , which are high in protein , animal fat , and simple carbohydrates , are diabetogenic diets . A group of nondiabetic Whites and Pima Indians were given weight-maintenance test diets of traditional Pima foods for two weeks and modern high-fat diets for two weeks.135 While on the modern high-fat diet , both groups experienced a deterioration in glucose tolerance and higher cholesterol levels . Neel 's hypothesis that diabetic tendency is an advantage in situations where people experience frequent famine cycles may hold for many native groups.138 Neel postulates that individuals with a disposition toward diabetes gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as a buffer during a famine , allowing reproduction and transmission of the diabetic tendency to the next generation . However , his hypothesis is less applicable to the increasing rates in individuals from highly industrialized countries like Japan , where famine has not been experienced for generations . Although Neel 's hypothesis may explain the high incidence of diabetes in American Indians . Australian Aborigines , and Polynesians , it does not explain // the high incidence in Japan and other highly industrialized societies , nor does it explain the lower incidence of diabetes in most westernized countries . It may be that westernized countries went through a critical dietary change several generations ago , before adequate treatment for diabetes was available . Consequently , large numbers of diabetic people were eliminated from these populations because of greater mortality and decreased fertility . Thus genetic factors conducive to diabetes became less common in these westernized countries as the force of natural selection eliminated persons carrying the diabetes gene(s) . If this supposition is so , the incidence of diabetes in groups who have recently changed food habits will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations ago . This means that susceptible individuals from populations experiencing a transition to a high diabetes rate will need to modify their newly acquired westernized diets . Obesity 's relation to diabetes is not as clear as diet is . Obese individuals whose fat is concentrated in the upper body are more susceptible to diabetes than individuals whose fat is concentrated below the waist.739-741 Body fat deposition differs by race , ' 42 , ' 43 but low socioeconomic status and low educational level are implicated in fat deposition. ' 44,145 Duration of obesity is also positively related to diabetes . ' 46 GALLBLADDER DISEASE American Indians have the highest rates of gallbladder disease in the United States.147 Cholecystectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure for Indians.14K-'S0 Thirty-six percent of Pima Indians were admitted to the hospital for gallbladder disease as compared to 6 percent of Massachusetts Whites . ' 49 Blacks have less gallbladder disease than Whites.151 " 52 Hispanics as a group have less gallbladder disease than non-Hispanic Whites , 151 but Mexican Americans have more gallbladder disease than non-Hispanic Whites ' 53- ' 54 and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups is probably due to the American Indian admixture in Mexican Americans . ' 47 , ' 56 Data on other races are limited , but a Hawaiian study of hospital admission rates for gallbladder disease was conducted on eight races ? Chinese , Japanese , Koreans , Filipinos , Hawaiians , Portuguese , Puerto Ricans , and Whites . ' ' ' While the differences in admission rates among the races were statistically significant . they were not clinically significant . since the rates varied between 1 and 2.5 percent only . The gallbladder admission rates in this study were a few percentage points lower than those for Massachusetts Whites , but they were over 30 percentage points lower than those for Pima Indians . The sex ratio for gallbladder disease is around two females to one male for most groups . ' S ' . ' S8.159 American Indians have a very different sex ratio : approximately seven females to one male.157 Numerous variables have been studied in relation to gallbladder disease  --  age , body fat , blod lipid leves , imparied glucose // tolerance and diabetes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , ' 5 , ' 60. ' 6 ' and socioeconomic stittus15- ' 6 ' ? but reports conflict , depending on the group studied and the variables controlled for . For instance , age is positively associated with gallbladder rates in studies of many races , 154 " ' 60 but not for Blacks.152 GLAUCOMA The two major types of glaucoma differ in prevalence by racial group . Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common type among Blacks and Whites , while primary angle-closure glaucoma is the most common type in Asians and Eskimos . ' 6 ' - ' 64 Blacks have an age-adjusted prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma over four times that of Whites . ' 62. ' 65 Eskimos are 20 to 40 times more likely to get glaucoma than Whites . ' 64.166 And Orientals have similar to lower prevalences compared to Whites . ' 63 Glaucoma-induced blindness is six to seven times more common in Blacks than in Whites . ' 67 , ' 68 Glaucoma also shows up as much as 10 years earlier in Blacks.1 " - ' 7 ' Glaucoma-induced blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaucomatous Eskimo eyes were blind . ' 63 Both environment and genetics are postulated as causes of the racial differences in glaucoma prevalence . The lamina cribosa area , including the optic nerve discs , is larger in Blacks than in Whites . ' 70. ' 7 ' , ' 73 Optic nerve discs are also larger in Orientals and Asian Indians than in Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites.174- ' 77 An inherited shallowness of the anterior chamber depth of the eye was thought to be the reason for the predominance of angle-closure glaucoma in Eskimos , but examination of 64 Greenland Eskimo immigrants who lived in Copenhagen for over 25 years showed that the immigrants ' anterior chambers were deeper than that of their native population in Greenland , but angle-closure glaucoma was still present in 2 of the 64 immigrant Eskimo subjects.166 Thus environment apparently influences anterior chamber depth . Meteorological data from Finland show that the prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma is positively associated with low levels of sunshine.178 Intraocular pressure varies by iris color ? Blacks with brown irises have the highest intraocular pressures , followed by Whites with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug therapy for glaucoma is not as effective in people with darker irises.767 For them it takes a larger dose of medication to produce an adequate reduction in pressure . HEART DISEASE , HYPERTENSION , AND STROKE Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the leading cause of death in the United States . Coronary artery disease , hypertensive heart disease , and stroke all vary in frequency by race . Coronary Artery Disease Blacks and Whites have similar are adjusted rates of coronary artery disease mortality , but Blacks have lower morbidity rates . Hispanics , have // lower mortality rates compared to non-Hispanic Whites.50 ' ' 82 ' " 3 In toto , American Indians and Alaskan Natives have lower rates than Whites , but three Indian Health Service areas report higher rates than those for Whites ; " ) ' " . ' " in the Bemidgi Service Area in Montana , the rates are twice as high as for Whites .

' " 6 Coronary artery disease rates have declined in the United States ; ' " ' " " - ' " 9 this decline continues for White males but is leveling off for White females and Black males and females . ' ' ' ) The frequency differences in coronary artery disease among races have both environmental and genetic components . Mortality rises in specific groups ( Chinese , Filipino , Japanese , and Puerto Rican ) when they move from rural to urban areas , or change lifestyles.191- ' 94 Mortality decreases in other groups following declines in risk factors ( United States and Iceland ) .195196 Populations that consume fish have lower rates of coronary disease than populations that do not , and within the same population . fish eaters have lower rates than those who do not eat fish.197- ' 99 Higher rates of coronary artery disease also occur in smokers , 200 and sedentary individuals . " 01 Combined environmental and genetic components that effect frequency differences in coronary artery disease include serum cholesterol levels , 793.200 systolic blood pressure , 200 and upper body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may possibly be assigned to racial variation , but other explanations are equally tenable . By far the best evidence for a genetic contribution to coronary artery disease is lipoprotein level , which seems to differ by race . Blacks have elevated high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) levels compared to Whites ; 206 207 these lipoprotein differences are present at birth . ' " This may account for Blacks and Whites having similar disease frequencies despite Blacks having more risk factors . Lipoprotein levels are similar in Japanese and Whites . ' - 09 Hypertensive Heart Disease Morbidity and mortality rates for hypertension vary by race . Both are higher in Blacks than in Whites . ' " ' ' 210 ? ' " Mexican Americans have similar or lower rates of hypertension compared to non-Hispanic Whites . ' " " ? 211 ' - 13 Japanese- and Chinese Americans have lower rates than Whites , while Japanese in Japan have hypertension rates intermediate between Blacks and Whites.2144-215 Hypertension rates are rising in American Indians , 216 ' ' 7 but are still generally lower than those of the United States as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are similar to those of men , although prevalence rates are higher in older women ; this is probably because women live longer . ' " Hypertension in Blacks is clinically and biochemically different from hypertension in Whites ( see Tables 5.3 and 5.4 ) . These differences bring up the same question that arises for the blood pressure differences what roles do genetics and environment play ? // Evidence suggests that the environment is important . Among Blacks in the United States , hypertensive heart disease becomes less common as educational and income levels rise . ' ' H'ty The rate of hypertension in employed Black men is also substantially lower than expected . compared with those who are retired or of unknown employment level . ' - ' " Black men in professional , technical , and managerial positions , those who are independent farmers or farm managers ,
