<p> In an Atlanta office with dove designs on the windows , Jimmy Carter 's lilting Georgia accent is the sugar coating over rock-hard conviction , as he lays out beliefs that make people squirm . <p> " The greatest discrimination in the world now is the rich against the poor , " he says . By " rich , " he adds , he means someone with food to eat , a house to live in , a reasonable education , decent health care , a modicum of hope . <p> " We do n't mean to discriminate ; we may be well-meaning , " he says . " But how many of your readers know a poor family well enough to visit their home ? To have a cup of coffee ? To know the names of their teen-age children ? Or , God forbid , to invite them into their own homes ? We care about poor people , we go to church , and we talk about them , but do we ever actually reach out ? " <p> It 's the cusp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the United States , served and suffered as leader of the most powerful nation on Earth . Today he 's wrapping up an interview in the Carter Center , a garden-dotted enclave within a complex of cylindrical buildings far removed from the political torrents and eddies of Washington . From here , he has pursued an international agenda for human rights and freedom since 1982 . It 's an agenda so global in scope , so ardent in intent that it , too , could be described as millennial . <p> Since being voted out of office in 1980 , Carter has turned his energies to the scorched plains of Africa , where center programs show poor farmers how to dramatically increase their crop yields ; to fledgling democracies in places like Zambia and Nicaragua , where center workers monitor first-time elections ; to tense negotiating tables in Haiti , North Korea and other hot spots , where Carter has resolved conflicts without bloodshed ; to disease-laden Third World backwaters , where his health initiatives knock out centuries-old epidemics ; to U.S. inner cities , where revitalization programs seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where wife and partner-in-mission Rosalynn Carter strives to erase the stigma of mental illness . <p> And to poor urban and rural areas throughout America and the world , where since 1984 the former president has lent his name to the Habitat for Humanity International program during the annual Jimmy Carter Work Project . For one week , Carter dons blue jeans and work apron to build homes for the poor . This year 's site is in Houston . Starting Monday , Carter and 6,000 volunteers will build 100 low-cost homes for needy families , who aid in their construction , then buy them through no-interest loans . The work project is always a media event , and this year promises to be even more , as 100 homes in a week will be a record . <p> But on this humid Georgia day , Carter is taking time to chat with four students from Scotland , all scholarship recipients at nearby Emory University . He sits at the head of a long table inside a big , oval room decorated with a stately stand of flags and a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suits , the students laugh breathlessly at his jokes , respond to his questions in clipped accents . <p> Carter , at 73 , looks to be in great condition , with the white hair and trademark toothy grin sketched by countless editorial cartoonists . He speaks in the soft , Southern cadences that for four years played on America 's political soundtrack . Relaxed and grandfatherly in an open-necked shirt , he props one knee on the table . When one student , a young woman , mentions she worked part time at an inner-city Atlanta school , Carter pricks up his ears . What did she learn , he asks ? <p> " It taught me a lot about cultural diversity , " she says softly . " And I 'd never had the chance before to see the , um , financial diversity . " <p> " It 's a chance few Americans have , " he adds . <p> If anything , that has become the leitmotif of Carter 's life since leaving office : haves and have-nots and the chasm between . A man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steroidal inflation - miseries , many scholars now agree , largely not of his making - has in more recent years come to symbolize something altogether different . More than anyone else , Carter has redefined what it means to be an ex-president , carving out a new role as global grass-roots humanitarian and worldwide peacemaker . Some say he 's attained the stature of a Gandhi , Albert Schweitzer or Mother Teresa ; in the Third World , especially , he 's close to revered . On any given day , a seemingly ceaseless stream of leaders , dignitaries and activists from his own country and beyond come to his office to bend his ear , glean from his wisdom . <p> All his efforts have a sole focus : bridging the gap between rich and poor . That 's what Habitat for Humanity is , Carter says : a reaching out . <p> To understand Carter 's involvement in Habitat for Humanity is in great degree to understand the man . <p> There is , of course , the spiritual component of Habitat , a Christian-based program formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make concrete in the real world the Gospel of Jesus Christ ( who , after all , was a carpenter ) . Carter , arguably the most famous Southern Baptist in America shy of Bill Clinton , and a staunch believer in faith through works ( " the Bible says faith without works is dead , " he says pointedly ) was naturally drawn to this philosophy . <p> But he was drawn also to the group 's all-embracing " big tent " theology , which welcomes all to the work site - be it volunteer or homeowner - regardless of a person 's faith or creed or lack thereof . This blends perfectly with Carter 's own evolving religious ecumenism , traced in Living Faith , one of 13 books he 's penned since being president ( including poetry and a children 's book ) that chronicles the sustaining power of his Christian belief through the years . All faith traditions are grounded in similar principles and deserve respect , an attitude much in evidence on the Habitat work site , he says . <p> " We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Muslims who share with us , we have poor families not certain of their faith , " he says . " We 're not exclusive at all . " <p> Habitat for Humanity , he says , allows him and Rosalynn to put their religious faith , also the underpinning of the Carter Center , into practice . And it lets Carter get his hands on wood . As a " working man " who grew up plowing fields and shaking peanuts , he says , the act of building a house is nothing alien to him . A skilled woodworker , Carter always brings his own tools to a Habitat project . <p> But a major impetus for his linking with Habitat was a childhood spent in Depression-era Archery , a town near his birthplace of Plains , Ga . It was as segregated as any town in the South during that period , and Carter , the son of a well-respected farmer and businessman , grew up surrounded by poor black neighbors whose children he could play and pick peanuts with but who were n't allowed to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living Faith , was in many ways ideal , full of church lessons and chores , unquestioning loyalty to parents and big Sunday family gatherings replete with fried chicken and mashed potatoes . But always on the periphery lurked the uncrossable chasm of prejudice , a gulf he came to view as a " millstone " around the necks of the black and white people of Archery . The only person who dared cross it was his mother , Lillian ( or " Miss Lillian , " as she came to be known to the nation ) , a registered nurse who served as friend and country doctor to her impoverished black neighbors , who paid her with chickens or eggs . Flouting the rules of segregation earned his mother the reputation of being " eccentric . " <p> " People did n't criticize my mama , " says Carter , grinning and resting a foot on a low table . " They just thought she was quite peculiar and left her alone . " <p> Carter 's mother later served in the Peace Corps in India in her 70s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelled him to make human rights the cornerstone of his presidential foreign policy , the high point of which was the 1979 signing of the Camp David Accords , the historic Egypt-Israel peace plan . His mother 's influence helps fuel his current Carter Center efforts to promote and protect human rights around the world . And it lies behind his advocacy of Habitat , which crosses the chasm , he says , by placing haves and have-nots together at the same place , where they can discover each other 's essential humanity . <p> Carter 's involvement with Habitat started when he was out jogging one day in New York after delivering a sermon at a celebration for Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos in the early ' 80s . He decided to jog by the site of an ongoing Habitat project , the construction of a 19-unit apartment complex , where he found a host of volunteers ( mostly college students ) in a lumber-strewn state of disarray . He " felt sorry " for them and mentioned casually that he and Rosalynn ought to help out sometime . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were trying to get a small Ford bus to get six of us up from Georgia to New York . " <p> The six eventually grew into 50 , the Ford into a Trailways bus . That year , Carter slept on the floor with the other volunteers . He returned the following year to complete the apartment project . Since then , for the past 15 years , he has done yearly projects all over the United States , from Chicago to Miami to last year 's site in Kentucky 's Appalachian Mountains , and in overseas sites in Tijuana , Mexico , plus Canada and Hungary . Each year , the number of volunteers has grown exponentially . Next year , after Houston 's record-breaking project , Carter will help build houses in the Philippines . <p> As important as the houses built is the media attention , which serves to put the topic of affordable housing for the working poor ( Habitat 's target demographic ) on the table . Part of the reason the program is so well-received , says Carter , is that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its thesis : social activism for the poor that at the same time avoids the dreaded " something for nothing . " <p> " We demonstrate to people through equal treatment that we 're their partners , " he says . " It 's not charity ; it 's not a giveaway . " <p> Nor is it lavish ; the homes are modest and unfurnished but well-put-together , with lawns and simple flower gardens . Carter , like the others volunteers , adheres to a rigid work schedule . The end of each work project is invariably emotional , he says . He often weeps . <p> " We meet the people that first night , and very few of them believe they 're actually going to have a house by the end of the week , " he says . " They 're afraid to believe it , because they 've had so many promises broken , by the government and everyone else . " <p> Millard Fuller , who with his wife , Linda , co-founded Habitat for Humanity , says Carter 's lending his cachet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president has ever done anything like this , " says Fuller . " They 'll go into a poor neighborhood , visit and have their picture taken . But none of them puts on their work clothes , stays and works . That 's the unique thing about Jimmy Carter . He works . Rosalynn does , too . " <p> The genesis of Habitat for Humanity 22 years ago has become legendary . Fuller , then a young millionaire entrepreneur , quit his job and gave all his belongings to the poor after Linda left him over his workaholic ways . Reunited , they moved to Koinonia Farm , a Christian community near Americus , Ga. , where they sowed the seeds for their idea to build homes for the poor . Today , Habitat for Humanity International has built 60,000 homes in more than 50 countries . It is among the top 20 home builders in the nation , and the largest nonprofit homebuilding organization . Carter , he says , has galvanized the mission . <p> " He 's given great visibility and credibility to the work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's excuses . Because if a former president can take a week off for hard labor , how can anyone else say they 're too busy ? " <p> The popularity and esteem that Carter enjoys today reflect a major turnaround from his image in 1984 . Still wearing the gloomy shroud of his presidency , he was asked not to show his face on prime time at the Democratic National Convention . Time has proved a dramatic curative for his legacy , says Mark Rozell , a political science professor at American University in Washington , D.C. , who has written extensively on Carter 's image rehabilitation . Some of this owes to hindsight , he says . <p> " His was an ill-fated presidency , " he says . " There 's no doubt Carter was not personally responsible for many of the crises of his presidency , and many people have recognized this in retrospect . " <p> Criticisms that Carter " micromanaged " his office ebbed in the face of " Iran/Contra-gate " and other " detail " lapses of the Reagan administration , says Rozell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be president - or at least to bomb Iran , which finally released its 50 American captives after Carter lost his re-election bid - seem ironic in the moral climate at issue in latter-day Washington . <p> But chief in the redemption of Carter - the U.S. Naval Academy graduate-turned nuclear submarine officer- turned peanut farmer-turned Georgia governor-turned United States president - is what 's come after his stint in officialdom . <p> " He 's the model ex-president , especially in contrast with his contemporaries , " says Rozell . " Nixon spent his time trying to rehabilitate himself , Ford spent it on the golf course or collecting fees on corporate boards , Reagan immediately accepted a $ 2 million speaker 's fee from Japan , and Bush , perhaps for the sake of his sons in politics , has pretty much stayed silent . Everyone 's going to remember him for jumping out of that airplane . " ( Carter 's only comment about his peers is to say quietly , " We all have our own lives to lead . " ) <p> More than once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in incendiary foreign policy matters . It 's not that Carter has changed , says Rozell ; he 's stayed the same . It 's that he 's more suited , perhaps , for diplomacy and altruism than wrestling compromises out of Congress . And his strong Christian faith , which in the 1970s made him something of an exotic creature while in office , carries not a " whiff " of insincerity or exploitation . <p> Indeed , if there 's anything integral to understanding Carter , it 's his faith . Everything he does radiates from that . A member of Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains , a moderate strand in a Southern Baptist denomination increasingly dominated by conservatives , Carter teaches a popular Sunday school class that routinely draws hundreds of visitors from around the world . His classes feature a give-and-take , question-and-answer format that ( like Habitat ) seeks to apply biblical meaning to the real world . <p> Carter can quote Scripture with the best of them , and he 's studied the heady theologians , too . Reading Living Faith , you encounter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has come to the conclusion that in the end it 's all about love . He 's an outspoken critic of fundamentalism , in his own denomination and throughout the world , saying it flourishes when people " equate their own beliefs with the exact teaching of God . " <p> " That means that inherently anyone who disagrees with them is wrong and therefore inferior , and in extreme cases subhuman , " he says , unblinking . " Much of the animosity and distrust and lack of forgiveness in society is caused by religious beliefs , by people exalting themselves . <p> " That 's quite contrary to my concept to the teachings of Christ , who said that the leader is the servant of all . And that we must try to be unselfish and generous to others . " <p> At its core , that 's also what the Jimmy Carter Work Project is all about . <p> When the Houston project is finished , it will bring the total number of houses built through the nationwide event to 480 . The logistics that go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some 6,000 seasoned and not-so-seasoned volunteers will nail together 500,000 linear feet of lumber , consume 70,000 meals , imbibe 35,000 gallons of water cooled by 100,000 pounds of ice in the hot Houston sun , in the presence of a former U.S. president and his Secret Service entourage , under the watchful gaze of the local , national and international media . <p> In spite of this , the Rev. Michael Shirl , executive director of Houston Habitat for Humanity , remains an amazingly calm man . He steers his maroon van past the three core sites , which lie in the Second and Fifth wards . At the moment , the planned homes are only concrete slabs with tubes sticking up out of them . Back at the spanking-clean Houston Habitat for Humanity warehouse , state inmates in white uniforms busily nail together house panels and assemble house " packets " containing fixtures , fans and such . The neighborhoods Shirl drives through are shabbily depressing - trashed-out lots , abandoned grocery carts , decrepit , tumble-down houses . Men sit on stoops at midday ; mangy dogs roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , built in 1988 in the Fifth Ward . The yards are neat and tidy , gardens are growing , and pets sleep on front porches . Habitat is a seed , a catalyst , says Shirl . Fifth Ward development efforts did n't start until after the first Habitat home was built . Now there 's a bank , a drugstore , a budding financial service center . Ownership breeds pride , which breeds dignity , he says . Like its national affiliates , Houston Habitat has never had a problem with homeowners defaulting on their loans . <p> " Of 145 mortgages , we 've taken one deed back in lieu of foreclosure , " says Shirl , an amiable Baptist minister with a salt-and-pepper mustache . <p> Houston won the right to host the Carter work project in a competition with 25 other Habitat affiliates , submitting a " 3-inch-thick " bid . Shirl had a hunch Houston 's dependable philanthropic base - churches , corporations , civic organizations - would come through to make possible the 100-house feat , and , sure enough , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , a corner lot on Sakowitz Street in the Fifth Ward . The former president will bunk at Rice University with other volunteers , says Shirl . Carter , he says , always insists on keeping media folderol to a minimum during projects so he can focus on work . Yes , his Secret Service agents will be in force , he adds , but they get to shuck their stiff suits for work clothes . <p> Carter also makes it a practice to meet and shake hands with the families who are receiving homes , says Shirl . This prospect thrills Maria Paz , who can hardly believe she will soon be a homeowner , much less press the flesh with a former U.S. president . She sits in the sweltering , cramped garage apartment behind her parents ' aging house in one of Houston 's innumerable run-down neighborhoods , perspiration forming on her upper lip . Last week , her air conditioner broke . Her brown-eyed twin 4-year-old sons , Chris and Cruz Rodriguez , watch a Batman movie in the bedroom all three have shared since their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , she says , and rarely sends money . <p> When she first heard about Habitat through her cousin 's sister , she could n't believe it . It sounded too good to be true . And at first it was : Paz , 28 , a full-time file clerk , was denied because of credit card debt . But she went to credit counseling , as her Habitat contact advised . She paid off her debt with an income-tax refund . She was accepted and took the various classes Habitat requires on budgeting and home ownership . She put in her " sweat equity " - 300 hours of volunteer work with Habitat - which culminates when she helps build her own house . <p> About 60 percent of those buying houses through the Carter work project are single parents , says Shirl . Applicants were enticed through advertising on TV , radio , on billboards in poor neighborhoods . Applicants must earn $ 11,000 to $ 23,000 a year ( for a family of four ) and must commit to the program . Paz , whose mortgage payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist driving by the site of her future home . She 's done so dozens of times . For the first time in their lives , she says , her sons will have a safe , fenced yard in which to play . <p> " This is it , " she says , scared but excited . " This is the first step in the rest of our lives . I 'm on my own , getting something better for my boys . " <p> Habitat indeed changes lives , says Carter . <p> He likes to tell the story of a woman in Philadelphia whose teen-age sons were always out roaming the neighborhood . Every time the telephone rang , she was sure it was the police . Then she got her Habitat house . <p> " She told me , ' Now my boys come home , and they bring their friends . ' They had been ashamed of where they lived . . . . Those of us who 've always had a decent home ca n't envision what it means to not have one . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carter Center domain . It encompasses Paz in Houston ; the baby in Africa suffering from malnutrition because the mother ca n't grow enough corn ; the villager in Yemen who contracts Guinea worm , a parasite that grows to 3 feet inside the body , then erupts through blisters . It includes the Latin American man suffering from river blindness , another parasite that takes sight ; the young mother in Bosnia who loses her son in a bloody coup ; the person who lives his whole life without knowing how it feels to vote . All those who suffer under dictatorships . <p> Through Carter Center efforts , the Guinea worm has been almost wholly eradicated ; river blindness is on its way out , as well . To date , the center has monitored multiparty elections in more than a dozen countries , crafted countless human rights documents . It grew out of the dispirit Carter felt upon leaving the White House , watching his Mideast peace plans stall . He was only 56 years old . He awoke one night and started talking to Rosalynn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work , they pondered ? Today , the 180-person-staffed Carter Center is likened to a mini-United Nations and has programs in more than 65 countries . Under its auspices , Carter and late Houston philanthropist Dominique de Menil established their annual $ 100,000 human rights award . Through it , more than 15 Latin American countries have been assisted in democratic reforms . <p> " And we get new requests from other countries every day , " says Robert Pastor , director of the Latin America program . When Carter travels in Latin America , he says , crowds of people often burst into " spontaneous applause , " both for his presidential human rights record and his efforts now . " Many know of his work and view the United States more favorably , precisely because he embodies the idealism of America , " says Pastor . <p> Mention his near-saintlike status , and Carter shifts uneasily in his seat . He wants to be remembered , he says wryly , as " a good grandfather . " And he 'd like the words " peace and human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's penned yet another book , this one titled The Virtues of Aging , on how the retirement years can prove a person 's most fruitful . Ask him if he feels more effective now than as president , and he pauses contemplatively . <p> " I do n't have any authority , " he says . " I do n't have the resources , the money I had as president . But I do have a lot of influence , especially overseas . I can induce people to do things for themselves . In many ways , my work since I left the White House has been the most gratifying period of my life , yes . "
