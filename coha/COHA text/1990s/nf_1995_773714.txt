txt // As a distinctive center of the original energy of being , the self mediates with itself and intermediates with what is other than itself . In this sense it is always between an inarticulate inwardness and the public world of social relations . Nevertheless , there is something about its own self-mediation that it can not completely mediate . There is a certain inward otherness that can never be entirely reduced to a determinate articulation . The power of selfbeing has a certain positive indeterminacy : as an origin of self-articulation , the source itself is overdetermined ; it is not a mere indefiniteness , but a particularization of the original power of being as excess and plenitude . It is impossible to isolate absolutely the self from the others , but the deeper we delve into the power of being that constitutes self , the more we come across an indeterminate power that is prior to any determination and that exceeds every determination , whether effected by the self itself , or by the social networks of relations which consolidates its communal identity . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selfhood , exceeding determination , conceptual or social , is the idiocy of its being . This is at the edge of determinate intelligibility , but it is not senseless . Quite to the contrary , it calls for the utmost in discerning mindfulness . I believe it is made senseless , if our only way of making intelligible sense is dominated exclusively by determinate universal categories . Hegel is blind to this truth of the idiotic " this . " He has no patience with it . It is immediately dissolved into the dialectical universal . We might perhaps be less resistent to Hegel 's move if it concerned a particular of nature to which we might be indifferent , or an indifferent thing like Krug 's pen . But what if the " this " is a person , if the " this " is a beloved " this " ? A beloved " this " is one in whom this intimacy of being is manifested as beyond atomistic separation , and social dissolution into an exclusively communal identity . A beloved " this " forces on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for Cordelia . Lear loves Cordelia in the thisness of this " this " ; he does not love Cordelia as representative of a universal humanity . Cordelia 's love also is not for the father as father or as king but for the father as just this singular father . There is a love that is concentrated on the singular as singular . This is not to close it off from what is other to this singular , but that is not the point . Likewise , we might again recall Abraham 's love for Isaac . Does Abraham love Isaac as Isaac , and this despite the horrifying thing God asks of Abraham ? Does he love him only as the bearer of the future race promised to him ? The horrifying thought in the very intimacy of horror , I suggest , is not the possible end to the future race , but the sacrifice of this singular I. This is Isaac my son ; his blood will be spattered on the rock ; his flesh will be cold and his eyes will be stones . Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has no substitute . This is the horror of the father . // Where can we accommodate this irreplaceable " this " in a logic of universals ? Any standard atomistic conception offers no help . It trivializes the " this " as " this " ; it neutralizes it . Nor is there any way one can love the " this " as " this , " in the sense at stake , if everything is to be calculated according to " rational " self-interest . The atomistic conception flattens the intimacy of being . Likewise , a universal holism produces a flattened conception . The tragic depth of Cordelia 's death as a beloved " this " and the extremity of Lear 's response is outside any logic of nameless public universals , or any socially constructed identity . This tragic depth exceeds the flattenings of atomism and social holism , and yet the very intimacy of being of the beloved singular calls for some acknowledgement of this depth . Neither the empiricist or the idealist alternatives do justice to the reality of thisness or the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediations with others . I take with great seriousness Kierkegaard 's point about inwardness , namely , its final hiddenness . Beyond a certain type of mediation , beyond thought even , Abraham 's silence is a kind of " mediation " beyond Hegelian mediation . I say this knowing that Kierkegaard rejects the language of mediation at this point , I think because he mistakenly believed that Hegelian mediation exhausted all the possibilities of mediation . This is not true . For there is nothing emptily mute here . Neither Lear 's Howl nor Abraham 's silence are the autism of being ; they are full of significance in excess of conceptual mediation . And do not say I contradict myself because I speak about what exceeds conceptual mediation . I am talking about the idiocy of being ; hence the saying is public in its own way . The difficulty is finding the best way to say this idiocy without flattening its excess . The idiocy has its own communicative power . Likewise , both the Biblical story and Shakespeare 's work are ways of saying that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful philosopher . It should be clear , then , that by the idiocy of singularity I intend no privatistic atomism , though I do mean a privacy of the intimate . I intend it also in this sense : there is a certain excess of being characteristic of what it means to be a self , which can never be completely objectified in an entirely determinate way . This is an affirmative overdetermination . Thus , the " presence " of a self can be understood to point to this all but incommunicable intimacy of being ; and yet this all but incommunicable intimacy , in fact , is at the very origin of genuine communicability . In many current debates " presence " is defined in the critique of the so-called metaphysics of presence , but this meaning is almost the exact opposite to what I intend : " presence " as the reduction of being to a completely available univocity and determinacy ; " presence " as completely transparent and available for intellectual consumption by Cartesian conceptions . This is a wrong contraction of the idiocy of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elusive . We know what it is before we say anything , though when we try to say exactly what it is , we know not what it is . Nor is this unexpected , because presence is an excess of being . It is the promise of self-transcendence that is especially characteristic of personal being , though it is prefigured in all being . This shimmer of presence , as the elusiveness of intimacy , is an indeterminacy in a positive sense , and might perhaps be called absence too : absence in the sense that there is no one definitive thing , univocal determinate entity that completely answers the call of what is here at play . Presence is absence , if our sense of being is completely ruled by the logic of a rigid univocity . The indeterminacy of selfhood is ultimately grounded in a freedom of being which can never be reduced to one determination or even an ensemble of determinations , since in itself it is a very source of determination . The origin of determination is itself indeterminate in this dynamic , open sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of a flattened privacy , in insisting that self be a completely determinate entity , sees nothing there , can not see anything there . This happens to Hume , for instance , when he looks inside himself for personal identity . He expects to find some univocal self . But there is no such thing . He concludes that the self is nothing . But since he still has a feeling of self ? and of course he has to have such feeling , because always and willy nilly he is an idiotic self ? he must seek to construct a self from the pandemonium of fleeting impressions . Of course , to define self-identity relative to this construction is question-begging , because a more original sense of self must be presupposed as the constructing source , which associates and brings together into congeries , the plurality of putatively discrete impressions . No self could be constructed from impressions , if this more original sense of self was not presupposed . For no impression could be felt as " mine " without this more original sense . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intimacy of elusive selfhood which the constructed self ostensibly denies . The Humean dissolution of the self is not unlike the post-structuralist denial of self and its deconstruction of the transcendental ego . Resort to the transcendental ego is marked by its own effort to reconstruct " presence " in terms of a universal ego , or a formal logical universal , or logical condition , free of all empirical particularity . But none of this is true presence at all . Consciousness in general , presence in general ? this is a contradiction in terms . Presence always turns on some sense of the intimacy of particularity . And so this resort to the transcendental ego can be a repetition of the philosopher 's penchant for flight from the particular into the universal . The consolations of consciousness in general are false alleviations of the burden of singularity as my singularity . To shed oneself of oneself in the neutral universal of mind in general ? this is one of the great illusions of idealism . // Again I do not want to deny the universal , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularity . The deconstruction of the transcendental ego does not get us to the intimacy of presence , since presence is reduced to univocal determinacy , and the deconstructionist , like the empiricist , sees no such presence , sees nothing there . But the intimacy of being , while not completely articulable in determinate univocal fashion , is communicable ; it is communication itself . We are thus pointed to the deeper meaning of presence . Presence is self-communication ; presence is already a vector of intimacy which is self-transcending , a vector that goes towards the other , even for the other . Presence is outside of itself , other than itself , because it is the self-communication of an original center of being to an other that too , in its own right , is presence , is self-communication . Presence lives the doubleness of being , between self-mediation and intermediation with the other . We need , then , an other idea of the universal that can not be just the Platonic eidos , nor the immanent Aristotelian form , nor the consciousness in general of idealism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other universal is not one term of a logical or ontological antithesis . It is the happening of the between . This universal is the community of the between where presence meets presence . This universal is the community of the middle , that space where being ceases to be an anonymous thereness , where self and other , each in their self-communication and their communication with the other , cross and crisscross . If the idiocy of personhood in its singularity is selfcommunicating presence , we are always beyond univocal presence , and the two , self and other , always go together . This universal is a community of being wherein idiotic particulars meet , in a meeting that is not a logical conjunction or an empirical contiguity , but a mindful being-together that is ineluctably ethical . There is no " being-with " without the intimacy of being . 3 . Elemental Idiocy , Self Before Self I will come to this community , but now I want to look more carefully at this prior sense of self , as well as a number of related conceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " selves , reappears in different experiences like pain , pleasure , insomnia . But the " root " is not the Cartesian " I think " or any version of it . It is not a preflective cogito . It is a prereflective idiocy , prior to all cogitos , and all determinate thinking . // Since Descartes we have been wont to think in terms of the antithesis of subject and object , out of which antithesis emerges an understanding of mind as essentially objectifying . The world of being-other is there , as having been made an object for the subject . The difficulty then is that this objectifying mind has to account for itself , and as other than an objectified thing . The subject objectifies being , but this objectification of being-other , when then applied to the self , objectifies the subject , and in essence the subject as subject vanishes . Thus , the intimacy of being is dissolved in the modern antithesis of subject and object . Reacting to this a variety of existential views were developed , and rightly . Objectifying mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectification . There is an oblivion of self in the very success of self as objective mind . Such objectification may have some relative justification when applied to beings other than human beings , but with the latter something other is required . This is , in part , why Kierkegaard will claim that truth is subjectivity . He and other existentialists have been criticized for overstating the case against objective mind , and for ambiguity with respect to subjectivity itself . Such criticisms are not the issue now , though the issue is , at least in some respects , the proper interpretation of the truth of subjectivity itself . The danger with the existential and related reactions to objectifying mind is that their response is still determined , to some extent , by the antithesis of subject and object that , as we saw , led to the forgetfulness of self . If we fail to think beyond this antithesis , and simply recoil from objective mind back to subjectivity as its antithesis , we will still be in thrall to the antithesis , and in some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , we may counterpose a subjective irrationalism to an objective rationalism , or a merely solitary privacy to the alienating public space of the other , now called the crowd , or the herd , or dais Man . The prior sense of self , the intimacy of being , the community of being , and the mindfulness more fundamental than subjective , objective or instrumental mind , will still not have been thought . The distinction between subject and object is made possible by a sense of selfhood and community prior to the objectifying consciousness that lives in the distinction between itself and what is other . ' Consider the common analogy of mind and eye . The mind/eye that sees , knows that it sees and what it sees ; but the eye does not see itself as an eye in the same way it sees its objects . It later knows itself as an eye , later than its knowing what it sees , and that it sees . Eye here is not meant as an organ simply , but as power of // seeing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to be known for it to be ; its being what it is presupposes all instances of knowing . To see itself as an eye it looks in the mirror , but what it sees in the mirror is a reflection of itself , never absolutely itself . Its self-knowing in the mirror is derivative from a prior being with itself . There is presupposed a sense of self-relativity prior to all self-recognition in the otherness of the mirror . Otherwise it could not see and say : that reflection is me . The crucial word is recognition : there is a knowing of itself again , hence a second knowing , a recognition , but this knowing again is as if for the first time . How do we understand this paradox of the second being known as if it were the first ? Or the first coming to be known explicitly as if it were the second ? The answer seems to be : prior to this explicit seeing of self in its reflection , this recognition of self , the self already pre-explicitly knew itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . A singularization of the energy of being is with itself in a primordial and original way . The idiotic self is an elemental being with itself . It is irreducible . Call it atomic , if you will , in the sense of indivisible , in the sense of individuum . It can not be split in the sense of atomos . Nevertheless , a univocal logic of identity can not be applied to it . For this unsplittable , elemental I can be doubled . It is a " one " that can be a " two " or a " three , " indeed can diversify and multiply itself , and we can not assign a univocal determinate limit to the number of self-multiplications . The univocal mind will say that this is crazy . But indeed it can double itself , for how else would it be capable of self-recognition , which is just the happening of the I that we are interpreting ? In self-recognition , the self both cognizes and is cognized , recognizes and is recognized . It is not in external antithesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " its own " object . " The double , even the antithesis , is within it , rather than simply external . This enigmatic power to be such a double , to be self-doubling , can not be accommodated to the model of an external dualism of subject and object . At work in the heart of elemental selfness , there is an original power of selftranscendence and relativity to what is other . Idealism has shown greater insight here than is currently admitted to its credit . I add that I do not interpret this self-doubling as just the power to appropriate what is other to the self and hence to interiorize it within the immanent closure of an encompassing subjectivity that overreaches both sides of the antithesis of subject and object . Immanent self-transcendence does not exhaust the meaning of transcendence , just as objectified externality does not exhaust the meaning of otherness , or of being there as other . Yet we must agree with idealism . There is , we might say , a complex coil of self around itself , that is elusive , transcending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the univocal logic that is applicable to objectified thinghood . The " being doubled " that we see in self-recognition points // to the elemental self-articulation of the idiotic I. Every articulation of the elemental is in its own way elemental . But against the closure on itself of the coil of self around itself , the self-articulation of this original energy is a selftranscendence that is already a mode of " being with . " From the outset the meaning of community as " being with " is not to be conceived in terms of a transcending subjectivity that encompasses within itself the two sides of subject and object . Elemental self-transcendence and community are inseparable , so much so that an elemental " being-with " is constitutive of the idiotic I itself . The nature of the intimate self is " being with " : being with self , and being with what is other to self . But " being with " is not to be first interpreted on the model of objective or even reflective knowing . There is a more primordial " being with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or togetherness of objectified entities , whether of an ego or an external object ( these latter came later ) , or to the " being with " of the self with itself in the self-recognition ? the latter is also later crystalized by reflection out of the first elemental being with itself of the idiotic I. This idiotic self comes to more manifest expression with the aesthetic I ? aesthetic in its ancient and widest connotation concerning sensible and sensitive being . ' Being-there as other is given as aesthetic presencing ; so also the sense of self is emergent as aesthetically intimated . By the aesthetic self I mean the self in the prereflective and preobjective feeling of itself as fleshed . There is a being with self in the element of the body . There is intimacy to the flesh . Thus , my body is not a possession ; its myness is not that of a piece of property . There is first no distance on this flesh that might allow one to speak of its ownness in terms of property . My body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My flesh is proper to me but not as a possession . The body is elementally my own . The very notion of property is derivative from this more elemental " owning . " Thus , the slave is not just a piece of property , or one deprived of owning property . These points may be true , but more fundamentally the slave is deprived of the freedom of his body which is the freedom of himself . He is deprived of himself since another disposes of his body . He is not allowed to own his body . In truth , he still is his own idiotic and aesthetic self , beyond every appropriation of his body by another . This entails an ownness of owning beyond all property relations . This body is proper to no one but the I , in the radical singularity of its own idiotic intimacy . Even the slave has this ownness that he keeps to himself , that is absolutely other to his owner . Here is the germ of the freedom that , in the end , is the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This radical ownness must remain undefeated , integral even though wounded , if finally the owning of the slaveowner is to be overcome . In primary aesthetic feeling , there is presence to self which initially is a felt self-presence . This does not at all mean that it is determinately known as such . It is lived self-presence . We feel ourselves ; or rather we sense ourselves as in a sea of aesthetic presence ; we make no initial distinction between the external as an aesthetic presence and ourselves , our bodies , as aesthetic presence . This is why the opposition of subject and object comes later , and why it is a mistake to take it as original . There is in the flesh an immediacy of self which is not separately subjectified over against the world as an objectified otherness . We do not know in an objectified way if what is intimated in sense is the immediacy of the self or of the other . Sometimes it is felt as the immediacy of self , sometimes of other-being . An infant feels the other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no objectified distinction . This is the most rudimentary of all self-intimacies , and it is barely articulable , given what looks like a kind of promiscuous univocity that marks the absence of distinction between the self and the other . It is , if you will , an equivocal univocity , though it is not known as such , and hence is not a selfconscious equivocity . There is a lived presence of the self to itself , and of the self to things . There is an intimacy of immediate mind between the self and itself , the self and external things or others . There is the stream of minding as in process , and yet as present to itself . This minding is lived from within , prior to all more sophisticated acts of mind ; it is also always the being with itself of self in every subsequent act of minding . This is the self as aware prior to selfawareness . It is hard to separate awareness from self-awareness , since here we are trying to refer to awareness as self-aware prior to self-awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-consciousness as thematically directed and as self-reflective comes later , when the self has already developed its own powers of articulation and mediation , when it also has entered into a myriad of explicit relations with what is other to itself , or discovered itself to be thus involved , even though initially it does not know this involvement . It is very difficult to talk about this self-awareness prior to determinate awareness of self . Consider how the " con , " " cum " of consciousness carries the meaning of " with . " The " being with " can be with what is other to self . It can also be the self as immediately with itself . This is what is here in question . The intimate self is already a relation , a " being with . " But this relation that constitutes singularity is not univocally single . There is a " being with " that is a prereflective self-relativity . The idiotic singularity is this . To speak thus already seems to imply the splitting of the self into the self-knowing and the self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " such // as it is , does not occur in such a split as thus objectified . The idiotic " selfknowing " of the singularity has an intimation of a double . That is , there is no univocal prereflective self , though the prereflective self is the hearer of the call of a double : its intimacy with itself is also an intimation of the otherness that will call on it more insistently as it grows in its own self-mediation . What then of the unity of self ? Is the singularity a split unity from the outset ? I prefer to say that it is , from the origin , the promise of a double mediation . To be the singular promise of a double mediation need not necessitate a dualism of the self in itself and the self for itself , or again between the self for itself and the self for others . So we might venture that there is enigma at the center , the root ; the enigma is not first in the circumference . The source of the light is dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the shadows fall . The center and the source is the mystery . The light is dark to itself . There is an original power to be that is singularized in this self . The original intimacy with self is sensed as a certain unique energy of existence , a unique flavor of the energy of selving : the energy of being is sensed as the being at work of selving . There is the inward thisness as the prereflective mineness . We see this in the way a child says " mine . " Existence reveals itself as an irreducible insistence of self , and this insistence as a " mine , " as a " this , " as a flavor of " this , " a savor , a taste individuated . We taste only ourselves in this radically intimate way ; we can have an intimation of the intimacy of another self . ' I savor self , I can savor self even in the domestications of habitual sameness . I may be an insipidity this morning , but I feel it as inescapably mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it and no one // knows , sometimes not even I myself . Or I am worn down ; I am the wear of time . Or I savor self as a hidden hope , a dream hovering on the edge of time 's desert , a mirage , a sign . Or I can not stand myself , I flee myself ; but I am myself fleeing . My escape is my escape and there is no escape . There are ruses and distraction . There are pretenses which try not to savor self . 1 am disgusted with myself ; I am disgust ; I taste its nausea as a drink I can not stomach ; I can not stomach myself ; my self-being revolts at itself , finds itself revolting . And yet in all this wretched innerness there is something astonishingly great . Being sick at self , being sick at heart ? what other I in nature is sick thus , with a sickness of spirit ? What other I shows this stress of innerness ? an I that might go mad with the nuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self can come , for instance , in the experience of insomnia . I wake in the middle of the night . I am floating in a disturbing darkness , vaguely sinister , or muffled in ambiguity , one knows not where one is determinately . There is the indistinct threat of the indistinct world to the elemental self-being that is nowhere and nothing . Waking to the night and its terrors , the child knows it is nothing definite ; in itself it knows not who it is ; there is nothing definite on the walls of its room , on the sides of its crib , in the room 's empty air ; there is nothing definite and yet it is alive with presence and pulsates . The child cries out for another , and the comfort is simply to be touched , the hand of another , touched by elemental presence . The community of the reassuring touch dispells the sinister . We die , we will die like children . Death is the final idiocy of being . We may howl , or go into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeplessness , it may be calmer and more enduring , but it is the same as the child , only it feels sure that day will come . Day does not always come . Nor does the comforting touch that rekindles its trust in the good of being , or the being of the good . Perhaps the insomnia is endless , beyond night and beyond day , a dry burning patience of seeking that works on and on , even out of eyesight or earshot ; or burrowing below self-consciousness it infects one 's being , like a virus soundlessly spreading . What if , qua philosopher , one knows the day is also the night continued , and the insomnia is a metaphysical perplexity just at that equivocal pulsating of being ? There is nothing ; there is being ; in the ambiguity between the two , the self is stripped of its own determinate formations , when it wakes . It has retracted from its roles of the day . It has no role , only a tired and weary selfness that would be rid of itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zero point it can not rid itself of itself , can not retract that final step back into its own body . It has to endure itself and the ponderous presence , the burden of being awake . The stripped self is made sleepless by its own perplexity // 4 . Idiot Being and Indeterminacy I hear an exasperated query : Do you not then , just like Hume or the deconstructionist , lead us darkly along the path of dissolution ? Is the point then the vaporization of all determinacy ? I do not think so . The original power to be a self is articulated . Desire erupts in the idiotic self , it surges up in the flesh , elementally and unbidden . It comes to be shaped in a process of selving . Instead of the dissolution of determinacy , there is the fuller unfolding of this power to be into a distinctive self with a plurality of determinate self-manifestations . The singular self mediates with itself and intermediates with what is other to itself . It freely determines itself by being other to what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become through its own self-determination . The energy of self is carried by desire , as well as articulated by it ; and this selving is not first known in self-reflection ; it is known in its desiring . It is already desiring before it knows that it is desiring , and what it is desiring . It only knows itself by having been first propelled into a curve of self-transcendence , discovering itself determinately in this curve . There is incessant determining but no complete self-determination . What we crystalize in objectification is always only something of the fullness of what is ongoing in the energizing of selving ; it is not the fullness . The indeterminacy of determining , and the impossibility of complete self-determination , already intimates in the roots of self an openness to being as beyond selfdetermining being . While desire is energized in a singular self , it is never simply univocal , but pluralizes itself in its own forms . I mention two formations as especially important , namely , erotic and agapeic self-transcendence . These correspond to the two mediations ? self-mediation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcendence surpasses itself towards the other , but mediates with the other to mediate its own self-completion ; the other is finally for the self ; hence erotic self-transcendence is never entirely released from the self-insistence of existence . Agapeic self-transcendence , by contrast , is a surpassing of self towards the other that is for the other ; it more fully redeems the promise of community carried by the second mediation , the intermediation with other-being as other ; it is a love of the other that is not selfinsistent in the first sense . There is both erotic and agapeic promise in the intimacy of being , in the idiocy of selfhood . ' The Idiocy of Being 71 II My main emphasis now is not on these determinations , but on an indeterminate sense of self that precedes every determination . If we demand a univocally determinate self , we will deny such an indeterminate sense . Do we not vanish into vagueness without this univocal determinacy ? I think it is the exact opposite : If we insist that selfhood from the origin is univocally determinate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we dissolve in an indeterminacy that has nothing positive about it . Likewise , if we conceive of selfhood on a reflective model , then subject and object are taken as already articulated , and a presupposition of a determinate self is already effective in every subsequent thought . If we think through the implication of these determinate and reflective models , we can not sustain them , without either begging the question or an infinite regress . I first take the reflective model . It begs the question . Why ? If we talk about the self as self-reflective , then this self must have a sense of itself as both the subject and the object of the reflection . But in order to recognize itself as the one portrayed in the object as reflection , it must already have a sense of itself that allows it just to recognize itself . When I look in the mirror , and see a face there , I could never recognize that face as my own , did I not already have some sense of what was my own , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror . Without this prior sense of my own self , the image in the mirror would always appear as the face of a stranger , never my face . I would never see myself in the image . Self-recognition in the mirror presupposes a sense of self-knowing that is prior to the self-reflective phase . Consider the infinite regress : Suppose you say that self-identity still can only be gained from a reflection , then the problem of identifying my self in this reflection will presuppose a sense of self as already having been identified , and this will ask for another reflection , and then another sense of self , and another reflection , and so on and on and on . We get a hall of mirrors of infinitely regressing reflections and originals , and no original self . But this is nonsense since the ability to talk about such a hall of mirrors itself presupposes an original self . Thus , for instance , the deconstructionist conveniently forgets himself in deconstructing the self , forgets the living self necessary to make sense of the deconstruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinterpreted in a more positive light . It points to an inexhaustible reserve to the recesses of idiocy that ever elude complete objectification , that is suggested by objectifications of self but never univocally captured by such objectification . The prereflective self is not a univocal atom but an idiotic overdetermined power of being . Suppose we turn to views that insist on determinacy . What we find is a parallel argument relative to the empirical ego . The empiricist will insist that to be intelligible is to he determinate , and that to be determinate is to be given in determinate sense experience . In what determinate experience is // the determinate self given ? In none completely . We might then say that there is nothing there but a stream of impressions , an infinite succession of experience following experience . The empiricist will then say there is no self . But this stream is a degenerating form of the infinitude of self . It is a generation without a genesis , an issue without a source , a kaleidescope of images of an original that is denied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even images , for an image that images nothing is not an image , it is itself nothing . The infinite succession of experiences degrades into the self/nonself that is nothing . The empiricist disdains to become entangled in some of the deeper perplexities his deconstruction of the self precipitates . Perhaps because of a scientistic faith , or a common sense moderation , he flees such perplexities . Others will be less lacking in philosophical intrepidity . For instance , we can here get various forms of the self as erotic . Consider the Sartrean self as nothingness , as empty and lacking in itself . The infinite restlessness of desire degrades into an equivocal intentionality ; it becomes , for instance , the eroticism of Don Juan , the conquest of one sexed thing after another , and so on to infinity , ad nauseam . Instead of univocal determinacy the self 's infinity appears , but it is nauseating . Indeterminacy appears here in entirely negative form . With self reduced to empty erotic subjectivity , the outcome is an infinitude that nauseates rather than fulfills . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other than appears on the surface . Neither may be too comfortable with the closeness , but both operate within the context of the univocity of being , albeit in very different ways . They exhibit different attitudes towards the self as univocal . Deconstruction takes apart this univocity in a project of dismantling and overcoming metaphysics . Empiricism dissolves the univocal self in its search for that univocal self : it finds none . It , too , ends in a burning of the books of metaphysics ? to use Hume 's metaphor ? just as does deconstruction . From a scientistic beginning , from an anti-scientistic beginning , each recommends to us the auto da fd of metaphysics and theology . Both are infected by // equivocity , for neither is possible without the unnamed idiocy of being which their conceptual superstructures pass over . Traditionally the resort to the transcendental ego in Kant and other idealists was to avoid this equivocation : the incoherence of the denial of self , by the self . And yet the intimacy of being is not a form or a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity ? it is the source of this activity as exceeding this constituting activity . The formalism of transcen-dentalism reconstitutes the univocal sense at a level of higher universality ; hence , the transcendental self is nothing empirical but other ; it certainly is not personal ; it is consciousness in general . Thus , Kant will say ( Critique of Pure Reason , B 157 ) : " I am conscious of myself in general in the synthesis of the multiplicity of representations , therefore in the synthetic original unity of apperception , not as I appear to myself , neither as I am in myself , but only to the extent that I am . This representation is thinking , not intuition . " ' It is not intuition , for Kant holds , with empiricism , that the only intuition is sensuous ; there is no intellectual intuition . Kant 's universal form of consciousness in general lacks the intimacy of being . Indeed it is in flight from the idiocy of being . Far from this idiocy being the idealistic " for itself " of the transcendental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is the idiocy simply for-itself ; nor is it an epistemological ego . Nor is it quite Kant 's noumenal self : this is simply an unknown X , given a purely indigent characterization , set in dualistic opposition with the phenomenal ego . I think we must reject the indigent characterization as well as the dualism : the intimacy is communicated ; the intimacy is overdetermined , a plenitude , the promise of the agapeic self . Yet it remains mysterious and enigmatic ; so it must be interpreted . And perhaps this is part of the positive truth of Kant 's " unknowable . " Still he reduces the double to a dualism , such that the enigma can not appear in any shape or form . This is not true to the idiocy of being . Put otherwise , flight from the idiot self to the transcendental self will undo itself when the latter takes a formalistic shape . In the past , there then followed a flight from transcendental formalism , and also in a more hidden way from the idiotic self , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the truth of being is then sought in the historicist or world-historical universal . The historicized self is not the idiot or intimate self . There is a historical shaping of selfhood ? this I do not deny at all . The overdetermined energy of selfhood has a certain formlessness in itself ; it can become many things , take on many shapes , can become a plurality of forms , // multiplied even against each other . Time is necessary for the self to become itself . The past is the having become of the idiotic self , necessary to give it concrete ballast in the present of its open venture ; the future is necessary for the self to come to itself in terms of the ideals it sets for itself . All the complexities of temporal becoming are to be upheld , but the idiotic self is not the product of historical genesis simply . Nor is it a telos which in the end we will finally reach . It is an elemental source that is never left behind , not a goal projected at or beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the self that shadows the self as historically constituted . The ground of the historical self is the idiotic self ; and this idiotic self is never left behind . It seems to me there is danger of tremendous dishonesty with respect to the historicized self . Consider : a person becomes a king , an emperor , a mighty ruler in world history ; he constitutes his self as a great and powerful master ; he rules over all ; his subjects tremble ; his enemies cringe ; he swells with his self-articulating power , an erotic sovereign . He is Alexander , or Caesar , or Lear , or Stalin . Yet when the sun goes down and this mighty self lies down to rest in the night , he must strip . What is there ? Fleshed vulnerability of the intimate self . I am lord of the universe ; I lie down to sleep , and I am a breathing vegetable . Fitful with power , I sleep restlessly , but in the dark I awake . The darkness is the formlessness of being . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the silence my distinguishing marks melt . I am alone in the formless dark , a formless self , a cry of self , an idiot center of pain and hope , or hate , or anguish , or regret . The vulnerable idiocy emerges when there are none of the props that support the historicized identity . The determinations of the day are retracted . I am as nothing , though I am not nothing . I am a well of longing . I am a sink of sin and sporadic repentance . I am a cauldron of envy and plot . I may remember sunshine in an open meadow of childhood ; and , for no reason I can say , I am shaken to the roots by the . memory . I may be many of these things . Without the props of day I may sink beneath the surface of muteness into an autism of being . Or my silence in sleeplessness may just be a cry from the abyss . I am an abyss in the abyss of night . The helplessness that lies prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , is that idiot . Of course , morning comes , distinctions return , I am distinguished again . The tremors of the night grow quiet ; the lord of the earth lords once more . The patience of night is closer to the truth of self-being than is the selfassurance of day . The lording is a lie . The flight to will to power of the historicized self is fearful of the idiocy of the night , though the flight has produced its own darker night . History will assure itself with the daylight confidence of enlightenment , but it lies about the idiot self and the abyss of the night that it forgets or represses . The silencing of intimacy in worldhistory produces , in the extreme , the howl of the death camps . // World-history has perhaps been modernity 's biggest metaphysical lie . The idiot self reminds us of a simple truth : We come into the light out of a darkness of origin ; that I am at all ? this , too , is idiotic . We go back through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different night , or nothing , we do not know . The first and the last are metaphysical enigmas ; the middle is an enigma of intimacy ; and the lie of its mastery by world history is a flight from a mystery that chastens our hubris . History absolutized is perdition . The kingdom of heaven is idiotic , for idiots only . 5 . Idiotic Self-Relativity I mean no intemperance , so I will speak soberly of what might be called " idiotic self-relativity . " It seems we can not deny an elemental self-relativity , for it is the basis of our every effort to make sense . If the I were not self-related , it would not know that it had made sense . It must be aware of what it had done , to know that it had made sense , and this would be impossible did it not relate to itself with the relevant mindfulness . Do animals have this self-relativity ? One can not exclude some self-relativity , but it does not reach the range of human self-mediation which is immeasurably wider , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely self-mediating . It is not sim-ply biologically determined in a more or less univocal way . One might say that animal desire is pointillistic : it seeks this , this , this , and so on . This succession of this , this , this . . . would be an image of futility for the human being . This is why we substitute the phrase " ad nauseam " for the " and so on . " In our procession along an infinite succession of desires , we become mindful of the succession and of ourselves in the succession . There is the promise of mediating self-relativity implicit in the succession all along . The free range of self-relativity , and the possibilities of self-mediation transform animal appetition into human desire as free being for self . This self-relativity is not a mechanism ; it is in act , as an action , an acting . Again there is something elemental about this being in act and acting ; it is not reducible to something else . This is where the idiotic I germinates a determinate self-reflexive self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical ego is already a determination of the more original idiot self . Difficult though it is , we can talk about this origin ; it is not an autism of being . Nor is this origin an object ; and yet it can objectify itself ; it is self-objectifying ; and as self-objectifying it must be more than an object , for in the object it can come to recognize itself , self again . The process of self-ohjectification is necessary for the full articulation of the origin , but the origin must have some intimate sense of itself prior to self-objectification ; otherwise the self-objectification could not recognize itself as such , as self . But the original self can not he simply a product of the return of the I from its // self-objectification . It can not be simply the product of self-objectification ; for then it would be self-presupposing , which is just the point which seems to be denied , if the self is simply the product of self-objectification . The I acts upon itself : it is the acting and the act and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of this . Yet it knows that there is a difference between itself and all its actions , for its power of being is exhausted by none of its actions . Is the idiotic I just thought thinking itself ? No , for its intimacy with the other is always already there from the outset . The I is aesthetically concrete in its embodiment ; its intimate presence there can be a radiation that welcomes , or withdraws , or even threatens . There is no problem of epistemological solipsism . The sayability and unsayability of the idiotic I is not this problem . This intimacy of being and its unsayability is not a problem but a metaphysical enigma . A problem is a determinate question with the possibilitiy of a determinate answer . A metaphysical enigma is an indeterminate perplexity to which no one determinate univocal answer can be ever adequate . Every determinate answer points beyond this univocal answer to the deepening of the enigma , to dwelling further with what eludes complete conceptual mastery . Am I talking of something like Fichte 's intellectual intuition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he refuses Kant 's prohibition on intellectual intuition . Fichte 's I is the principle of thinking in general ; already the transcendental displacement beyond the idiotic I takes place . Yet Fichte does help us , especially if we see the meaning of " intuition " in a particular light . Consider the root of " intuition " in the word intus , the inner , the intimate . The intimacy of being , the " intus , " is implied in intuition , indeed to such an extent that philosophers have been extremely alarmed by claims of intuition . These , it is said , are merely idiosyncratic ; they are not publicly warrantable . But , of course they are idiotic , precisely because , if there are intuitions , they go right to the heart of the intimate self which resists objectification and hence manipulable availability . If we understand the " intus " and the " idios " with the requisite metaphysical complexity , any unqualified rejection of intuition founders . Rather the elusiveness of the truth of metaphysical mindfulness calls all the more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intuition " as a mask to disguise lack of philosophical honesty . Of course , intuition too often has been misleadingly objectified in terms of the paradigm of visual perception . From this paradigm intuition gets narrowed to the perception of a determinate object . Thus , intuition loses its essential reference to the intimate , and becomes contracted into a narrow determinate epistemological act . While this is not the place to offer the account , it could be shown that this contracted intuition is the objet ti ? // fication of a much more rich and complex mindfulness that is not marked by the univocal boundaries the objectifying account implies . Visual perception is a determination of mindfulness , articulated out of a more indeterminate aesthetic , fleshed mindfulness . This latter precedes and exceeds visual perception , and plays over the milieu of the determinate perception as a definite act of seeing . The intimacy of being is still at work even in objectified perceptual intuition . Were we to speak of an intuition of self , this would be an indeterminate intuition in an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a determinate object . This again is what Hume found . But he failed to understand adequately the meaning of what he found , or rather did not find . If we retain the notion of intuition , its meaning would have to be rethought in terms of the intimacy of being . The intimacy means there is a coincidence with self , before non-coincidence , yet with an intimation of the non-self . It is this primordial , internally intricate coincidence that is awakened to philosophical mindfulness in intuition . I can not completely abstract from the I ; but the I is never a solipsism ; self-relativity floats on a sea of sensed otherness ; the idiotic I lives in a fleshed aesthetic mindfulness . Thus , the primal self-relativity of the I can not be the infinite self-relation of the idealistic ego which merely thinks the other out of its own thought of itself . The idealistic ego is finally an erotic I that only excites itself : this is an onanistic intimacy . The self-generation of this ego is an auto-eroticism ; its self-becoming is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for itself ; it never escapes the circle of auto-eroticism , no matter how wide that circle may be swelled . There is not hetero-eroticism and certainly not agapeic transcendence that goes beyond the circle of erotic sameness towards the other as other . The spontaneity of the I is not infinite in act . The I is a finite particular creature , not a God . This is the whole point of its absolute singularity . Of this the idiocy of its being serves as a reminder , calls its creaturehood back to mind . The idealistic ego , especially that of Fichte ? is a false interpretation of self-relativity to the extent that it elevates this into the absolute ? literally ab-solo , from itself alone . The solitaire game of this absolute self-relating would absolve it from the other . Thus , Fichte found it intolerable for the self to be explained by another , even God ; hence his attack on the notion of a created self . ' This absolution of self-relativity from the other is plain wrong . We can avoid it by recovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other and enigmatic about selfhood. // 6 . Idiotic Freedom The issue can also be approached in terms of freedom . If there is an indeterminacy to the idiot I that is original , " original " does not imply atomic substance but source of origination . The original indeterminate I is free as an originative source of being . I want to suggest that this is not just freedom as self-producing . We find this latter concept in idealistic and existentialist thought , but it is very equivocal . If there is any self-production , it is not a creation from nothing . The self must already be for it to produce . The self is a creation , but not first a self-creation . If it were the latter , you would have the absurdity of its lack of itself being the original of itself . The lack would be the original , and hence nothing would be the original source . We might say that lack is itself originative only because it points us back to a plenitude of being that , in articulating itself , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desire for the other . The lack is energized by a more originary power of being . Freedom is not ultimately erotic , nor simply for the self . Put otherwise , the indeterminate freedom of the idiot I is not autonomy . For the intimacy of being is double , hence its being for itself is also heteronomous . Freedom as originative indetermination is agapeic , in that it can be for the other , and for the self in so far as it is free for the good . The self is created for itself to be the promise of self-creation that is the promise of being for the other . It is an agapeic creation that may create beyond itself , both erotically and agapeically . Freedom can not be reduced to a determinate power . A determinate power produces a determinate product , and a certain univocal causality binds source and effect together . Such univocal causality is found throughout nature , as it is in human existence . Relative to this univocal causality we have the power to predict determinately the consequent from the prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-defined , determinate relationship . ' This is not so with freedom : there is an idiocy to freedom as beyond the intelligible structures of univocal , causal determination . In freedom there is no univocal causality binding the prior and the posterior . The idiocy of being is a loosening of the bonds of determinacy . To be free in itself , the source of freedom must be beyond univocal determination ; for it can not be fixed . And it can not be fixed because it is a fixing or source of fixing , a shaping and not at first a shaped product . There is something elusive about this unfixed fixing , this shaping beyond shape , this open determining beyond determining . It is very difficult to make it intelligible , precisely because we tend to think of " making intelligible " as a process of // fixing a determinate structure . To render a reality intelligible is then to determine the indeterminate . But with freedom we can not do this completely . So there is something unintelligible about the original freedom , if intelligibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind that the process of making determinate intelligibility , qua process , is not itself a determinate intelligibility . It involves reference to a determining intelligence , an action of doing the intelligible , of being the intelligible , of being the energy of intelligence that understands the intelligibility of the structure . Thus , even the effort to fix determinate intelligibility is itself participant in a process that can not be completely fixed . We are always at the edge of determinate intelligibility with freedom . Each of us in the innerness of our intimacy is the very ontological taste of freedom . This taste of freedom is elemental in not being derived from other finite determinations . But this does not mean that it is self-derived simply , a completely autonomous self-production . Put as concisely as possible : Freedom is given to itself elementally , and only gives itself // to itself , because it is first idiotically given to itself . Its intimacy with itself is itself the gift of original being as other to itself . It is idiotic not only in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its being given to itself , simply to be itself , and then to produce itself and to produce beyond itself . We need metaphysical mindfulness of what is thus ongoing , in order to be recalled from objective intelligibility to the intelligencing self . But here , too , we come across something paradoxical relative to the ideal of univocal intelligibility . Intelligence is a reading between ( inter-legere ) : the inter is there in both intelligibility and intelligence . To be between , there is something more to intelligence than any determinate , univocal intelligibility . This means there is something about intelligence that is not completely intelligible . There is something about determinate knowing that is not known determinately . There is something about this or that determinate act of freedom that is not reducible to this or that determination . There is something about mindfulness that escapes its own minding . Minding escapes its own complete self-mediation ; it is other to itself in the very act of grasping itself or what is other . It exceeds itself in its very appropriation of itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess , a gift that it quickly forgets when its concentrates exclusively on its own power of appropriation . Its identity is other to its every identification , and yet it is simply this process of identification which is never-to-be-absolutized . The reference to the excess of indeterminacy as other , in the innerness of intimacy , suggests a source of creation beyond the self itself as source of origination . In a word , there is an other origin transcending the self as origin . The self as origin is itself an origin beyond the lack revealed in desire . This origin as plenitude of indeterminacy particularizes the self as this self . This particularization does not univocalize self ; it determines it to self-determination as always open . The particular self is given to itself by an original indeterminacy that , as idiotic , is never exhausted because there is always more to it that exceeds all finite determination . Of course , there is a proper sense of our infinite lack we can not deny : the human self is not God . Out of this lack arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of itself and the other in its own self-transcendence , with the view to achieving the promise of its own wholeness . But there is a different transcendence of the self from the side of the agape of being . Then the excess as " more " ( not a lack ) reveals the potential for agapeic mind and willingness . The idiotic self expresses itself as a double willingness : selfwilling , as its own insistence of being ; good will as the willingness to sacrifice the self-insistence for the other . This second willing is a making sacred of the idiotic self as for the other . The sacrificial self becomes a snrred sell , though it is still an idiotic self . The Idiocy of Being 81 7 . Community and Idiotic Being How is the idiocy of being compatible with the idea of community ? Is any move from the first to the second possible ? I want suggest that there is no move from the first to the second , since the two are always together , though the togetherness of the two can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community without communication , but there are many modes of communication , all relative to different modes of " being with . " " Suppose we reflect on what we deem an intimate conversation with another person . In such a conversation we already transcend solipsistic privatization . The point could be made that the intimacy of being makes possible , as it is also articulated by and communicated in , this being intimate with . As I have said , intimacy is itself a mode of " being with , " one that is not completely objectifiable , since it is the self in its lived innemess that is present in this communication . Both the inwardness and the " with " are complexly modulated by this " being with . " Our togetherness with the others , when it is a mode of being intimate with , transforms the meaning of socially defined identity . Intimacy is not something that has to be " in here " or " out there " in any determinable spatial sense . Being intimate with is a mode of being there with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both at the same time . True , it can never be merely outward ; intimacy always requires an energization of inwardness . A purely outward intimacy makes no sense , though there could be a more purely inward intimacy . Outward intimacy is the transformation of outwardness by this energizing of the promise of inwardness as self-communication , communication for and with the other . This transformation of outwardness into presence beyond objectification is evident , for instance , when something about the other " touches " us . What is this ? What touches ? What is touched ? This " being touched " need not be physical , though it may be that too . A handshake transforms the space of the between ; it may be warm , or limp , or reluctant ; one might feel that the hand was offered as an object without presence , and one made contact with a fish . A self retracts into itself and out of its hand , even as it offers its hand ? it does not offer itself . The retraction of presence is felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draining away of self into a wan absence . Contrariwise , a single word of intimacy may touch us to the depths of our being . The intimacy of the other beyond objectification passes in a communication that energizes the promise of our own intimacy of being . A certain physical touch , too , can astonishingly transform the interchange of presence between two selves , erstwhile there just as stones . // The happening of idiotic " being with " is easily deformed . Not only is aesthetic discernment and intelligent discrimination necessary , but also finesse of spirit . We show a lack of this if we conceive of the intimate and the public as dualistic opposites . Of course , these may be opposed , and often are in modern culture . A contracted privatism coexists with a devitalized togetherness . What is called " public " becomes a neutered space , indifferently available for all atoms of privatized desire . This neutralization of public space attenuates the original energy of being in an objective manner that matches the same attenuation in the subjectivity of the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , is marked by a certain intimacy of being that , like freedom , is impossible to reduce to univocal determination . Think of the following : How we sometimes wonder as to what makes distinctive this particular people , say the Russians or the Japanese . What makes it to be this people , so particularly its own ? An often suggested answer is that the particularity of a people is defined by a certain shared spirit , their own esprit . We know , of course , that this can harbor danger , ' ' but the crucial point is that this esprit can not be completely objectified . We can not say univocally that just this or that aspect is the spirit that makes the people this peculiar people . Often this spirit never appears into notice beyond its day to day being at work . For the most part it is revealed in some extraordinary crisis , say , the death or assassination of the head of state , or in the celebration of a victory , in war or sport . As to what exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning , we can not completely conceptualize it . There is an excess to objective conceptualization , because a community is marked by a nonobjective intimacy of being . In everyday life this is taken for granted . Frequently only its rupture gives one some sense of it . Consider another example , that of the exile or emmigrant . One leaves one 's own country and people for a new country and people . Before leaving , one lived in the intimacy of being of the first home . Now having left this nonobjectifiable intimacy , one painfully begins to get a sense of an elusive sense of everyday togetherness that previously was comThe // pletely taken for granted . This now haunts one , as no longer there . One undergoes its previously powerful presence in its present absence . The rupture allows the space for pained mindfulness of what was at work , but not noted . The same thing happens with the loss or death of a beloved one . Bereavement brings a contraction of the energy of being , once supported by the nonobjectifiable intimacy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one did not advert to its being at work . If the intimate and the communal need not contradict each other , why then are they so frequently opposed ? An important part of the answer is , I believe , that we objectify the intimacy of being by instrumentalizing it . Not surprisingly , the coarsening of the intimacy of being is pervasive in Western instrumental societies . This is ironical since these societies are heirs to spiritual traditions that stress the unique singularity of the person . But when that stress is coupled with a will to instrumentalize being , the space of the public is voided of inherent value , and the outer loses the aura of communal intimacy . We may believe for a while that the self in its inner privacy will be the sanctuary of inherent value . This retreat into the so-called sanctuary of privacy is widespread in instrumentalized societies , but it is in flight from the effects of the instrumentalization , which it can not escape entirely . For it brings into the intimacy of being the same orientation to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrode this privacy also , and the private will be denied its intimacy . The communal and personal intimacy are so bound together that the instrumental devaluation of being produces the same despoiling of inherent value in one as in the other . We then say : Nothing is sacred anymore . The intrinsic worth of the other , of the self in its idiotic singularity , of the other in its idiotic intimacy ? these have to be respected in a noninstrumental way before the nonobjective radiance of communication is granted its right of place . The phrase " Nothing is sacred " invokes the idea of the holy , and a desecration . The language is not mere metaphor or hyperbole . Loss of the intimacy of being entails a desecration of the sacred spaces of being where the communal and the personal meet . A complete desacralization of being would produce the destruction of the intimacy of being and also the disintegration of " being with , " in any sense deeper than a mere being alongside the other . In the beginning and in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being religious . The word religio itself communicates this in its naming of a bond of relatedness and a tie of trust . The intimacy of sacred communion is in the depth of the idiocy of being . Were this depth entirely desecrated , the distinctive personal " being with " of human community would wither at the roots . Let me take a somewhat different approach . Think of architectural places . These arc puhlir spa ( es , almost always with a functional purpose . A building // is the instrument of a community in that sense . But even in this instrumentalization of lived space , there can be a transformation of the instrumentalization in the direction of the intimacy of being . There are architectural spaces where a rich sense of human intimacy is present or allowed to be . I do not simply mean intimacy of quantitative scale . It is true that the larger quantitative scale becomes , the more difficult it is to preserve the sense of intimacy . Even here one might claim that where the traces of the sacred are , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the space of intimacy created by a medieval cathedral . Considered on a purely quantitative scale this would seem to squash personal presence in its singularity , and yet it does not . Compare this with the monstrosities dreamt of by the Nazis , as by Albert Speer , or the use of monstrous space at the Nuremberg rallies . The immensity of space here was to dissolve the singularity of self in a visceral surge of togetherness . It aesthetically shaped the intimacy of a people , at a level below discriminating mindfulness . This public space produced an idiocy of being that brought to the surface the dark togetherness of a people , feeling its power in an orchestrated surge of selfexcitation . This surge was earthed in the figure of the Fuhrer . Here we see the darkness of the intimacy of being , exploited by a public space , instrumentally wrought to whip a gathering into a volkisch frenzy . The power of spirit , touching the intimacy , is equivocal . It can be twisted into an idolatrous worship of the people or its leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dissolved , the locus of what I call an absorbing god , of the people itself as an absorbing god . By contrast , the immensity of the architectural space in the cathedral served to focus the soul on itself initially , to help it recollect its spirit in the intimacy of prayer . The self is to remember who it is , as a creature before God , God who is not an absorbing Moloch , but an agapeic absolute who does not dissolve the differences of creatures , but loves them in the singularity of their singularity . Having welcomed this return to the nonobjectifiable self , the space shapes a second mediation : there is a transcendence towards the other , as the self is drawn out of itself by the movement of the space upwards , vertically . The surge of spirit is caught up in the space that points vertically beyond towards transcendence as other . There is a movement of self-recollection from exterior distraction to interior respose , then a movement in the intimacy of the soul to the superiority of transcendence . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into hubristic self-assertion . The sacred place is the communal space of a people . There is no dissolving of singularity into the one leader . There is journeying together , on the pilgrimage of finitude . The tourist , voyeur of sacred spaces , knows nothing of this pilgrimage . Camera snapshot : still of the scene , click // of the metallic eye ; the intimacy of being is not revealed . The space of intimacy , as communicating a being with , calls for participation . The point , then , is that a public space can be marked as welcoming both the singularity of the person and its relativity to what is other . In different degrees , it can concretize the intimacy of being . This concretization need not be an objectification ; it can be the sensuous manifestation of the promise of that community of presence . Were a building a merely neutral instrumental space , it would foster the degrading of this promise . The promise is itself degraded into predatory opportunism in a network of transactions , wherein the self can maximize its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of an ethos . It is the profanation of space , and incites profanation . It is little wonder that such profane spaces foster selves devoid of reverence and respect . How profane the modern city often is , how lacking in intimacy its spaces and denizens ! Is it any wonder that these denizens flee into a privacy shuttered against the other , now also profaned into a threat ? The genuinely public space , as soliciting the promise of a community of presence , is a space of betweenness where the self , even in the idiocy of its singularity , feels it can be at home , at home with the other . Home ? this is the most elusive word ; this is the word of intimacy . Home is a word of mystery . It is a word that can not have one univocal meaning , and yet it is not merely equivocal . When we are at home , we know we are there , though we can not say completely in clear discursive conceptions where we are , and what it means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiot self . Home may not finally exist in this world . It may be what the religious call the kingdom of heaven . Yet only by preserving the intimacy of being will we keep alive the promise of this kingdom . In its light , there might be something hellish about a perfectly functioning modem state , one that lived by nothing but the instrumentalization of being . The sinister nature of its perfection would just be that everything seems to be functioning absolutely efficiently . But the elemental human presence as self-manifestation and selfcommunication would be absent . In that functional perfection , we would be lost , the kingdom would be lost . There would be no people . There would be no home . We can not protest too loudly against the functionalization of being that still proceeds apace in Western capitalist societies , notwithstanding all our protests of the inalienable rights of the individual . The mystery of selfhood , beyond every function , has to be reaffirmed . This is its idiocy as a value in itself and as a being for itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalization seems to have been repudiated . Yet the danger that the latter magnified into world-historical visibility is the same danger facing the increasingly functionalized societies of the West ? the failure to understand fully the public space of community in the requisite terms // of the intimacy of being . The totalitarian states rushed over the irreducible singularity much more violently than does the capitalist West . There privacy is let be to a greater extent , though often in the form of self-distraction or ethical neglect . But the singularity of self is still dominantly understood as an exploitative , or to-be-exploited , unit of productive , instrumental power . The logical and ontological basis for the violence is a mistaken , rather incomplete , understanding of the relation of singularity to universality . What I mean is that the Marxist communization is an heir of the Hegelian move from particularity to universality . The communist state may purport to be the concrete universal , but this concrete universal failed to let be the singular in its intimacy . This universal , supposedly concrete , is still not concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfhood . Marxism and capitalism share in the same functionalization of being . Both reveal related pragmatic appropriations of the philosopher 's flight to the universal : the universal will no longer be merely contemplated ; it will be practically enacted in the reconstruction of community , in accord with a certain ideal of rationality . But if this universal is an abstraction , the reconstruction will inevitability share in the poverty of the abstraction . The metaphysical danger is forgetfulness that this is an abstraction , hence a possible distorting source of community in its concrete promise . Against functional and world-historical amnesia , surely the philosopher must remember who and what we are ? What we are is a promise , always frail , ever threatened . The promise must be kept in mind , even if it can not be contained within a conceptual system , or a society constructed according to an idolatry of function . If it is at the edge of rationalization , it is not any the less real , or lacking in supreme interest to thought . A certain kind of metaphysical thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be something idiotic about metaphysics as a thinking beyond systematic categorial science . This idiocy of thinking need not be a philosopher 's anxiety , or indeed terror . Thought may find a home there , there where it is not at home in the world-historical abstraction . Such thinking inevitably has an ethical and political dimension . Idiocy is politically powerful , just in its political powerlessness . This is a truth to human being relevant to ethics and politics that is tangential to , in a different dimension to , that of world-historical or systematic universality . From the standpoint of the pragmatic and logical truth of the latter , the former may be the real metaphysical truth . Relative to this , pragmatic truth may be a lie , ultimately . Systematic truth may be systematically incomplete . What may be suitable for certain pragmatic and conceptual domestications of middle being , may dissemble the depths of middle being , its heights or extremities , all intimated through the idiocy of being . // In premodem thought the functionalization of being was less systematic ; nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global project of rational and technical mastery . Thus , ancient and medieval theoria promises more of an open contemplative vigilance for the manifestation of the intimacy of being ; the elusive presence of being there in the enigma of its being there . Metaphysical thinking can not be divorced from the ethical : the double mediation of the self preserves its inherent value as a this , and yet points to it as a deep down appeal for dignity , an appeal showing its coimplication with other selves . A metaphysical rethinking of this intimacy forces us to think the ground of ethical dignity . And in this ethical appeal one notes again the inseparability of the communal and the idiotic . An appeal goes out towards the other , but it always has an intimacy to it , something of the elemental thereness of the singular self in its vulnerable being for-itself . An appeal is an exposure to the other wherein we ask the other to be with us . It invokes the second intermediation of the other . Appeal can not be reduced to singular self-mediation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms no real explanation of irreducible dignity is possible . 8 . The Intimacy of Torture , Love I want to illustrate the matter relative to two opposed shapings of the intimacy of being : torture and love . Love and torture are coeval with human being , yet the instrumentalization of being in modernity has affected both . We find widespread use of torture , even while it is rejected widely ; we find widespread cheapening of love , while eros is publicly exploited more and more profanely . In the violence of torture , one has to say that there is a peculiar intimacy between the torturer and his victim . This is an asymmetrical " being with " : the torturer wants to break into the intimacy of the victim , as a robber breaks into another 's house . Meanwhile , the victim is to have no recourse . He is despoiled by another who hides his own idiocy , or puts it at the services of destroying the intimacy of the victim . The torturer , let us say , wants to extract information from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an aggression in the word . Think of the extraction of minerals from the earth . Not incidentally , in premodem cultures miners were looked on with a certain ambiguous awe : mining skirted the edge of desecration ? the earth itself as mother was plundered , violated . The earth itself had an intimacy , an innemess on which the act of mining as extraction encroached . The miners would perform certain rituals to propitiate the earth for possible violation. // Bacon now is frequently cited for his image of the new science as putting nature on the rack , putting it to the torture to force it to yield its secrets . To put to the torture was an ancient means of testing a person in a juridical ordeal of truth . But if truth comes to light by way of torture , can we be so sure that the " hidden " has in truth been conquered , or finally dispelled in any entirely determinate knowing ? Suppose there are intimacies of being , not just relative to the self , but to the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resist the truth of torture ? The truth of torture would then be a metaphysical violence , one oblivious to the violence of its knowing , so far from self-disclosure has it driven the mystery of being . Such violent knowing would actually produce its own autism of being . With torture of the human being , violence or the threat of it becomes a way of forcing the intimacy of being to yield up what it withholds . This very forcing often has the effect of driving the intimacy into a deeper recess of self , into an idiocy that ever retreats beyond the encapsulation of the encroacher . This retreat of the intimate into its own reserve may infuriate the torturer . Alternatively , the torturer may be fooled or satisfied with " truths " that are divulged to him from a less intimate layer of being . Apply the analogy more generally ? as indeed Bacon does . Suppose determinate scientific knowing did find nature yielding determinate truths to it ; but suppose that its entire objectifying approach also produces the retreat of the intimacy of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose we are satisfied with such truths . Would we not be fooled into thinking that now we have gotten to the truth of being ? In fact , this truth of being , true as it is , would be untrue to being , relative to the mystery of its more intimate reserves of possibility . The power of objective knowing would be impotence before the mystery of being , and this power would not even suspect its impotence . Of course , the very suggestion that there is an intimacy of being beyond its objective power will be derided as " mystification . " There can be nothing more there because , of course , objective knowing can see nothing further there . Or it might be greeted with epistemological aggression : the self-defense of objective knowing becomes a hatred of any suggestion that finally it is metaphysically powerless or inept . With torture of the human , the torturer clearly hates the suggestion of his own powerlessness . The relation of torturer and victim is at the edge of the elemental : it is the very will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself ; it is the root will of one against the root will of the other . It is a war of elemental selves , in which one side has all the weapons of objectification , while the other side has nothing at all , except the idiocy of selfhood in its irreducible intimacy . The torturer wants to destroy that inward othemess of the victim in its irreducible intimacy . // For the torturer , sophisticated in the infernal art , the point is not to kill the other ; it is to violate the intimacy of the inward otherness . With some persons this inward otherness may be sufficiently strong , or stubborn , or unyielding , so much so that its drives the torturer into a fury of negation . Death is a defeat of the torturer 's intent to desecrate the intimacy of being of the other . So he develops a finesse in degradation . He creates techniques of demeaning objectification , submitting the victim to trials in extremis , which devalue his body into a locus of indignity . Degrading the other is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse pleasure of torture is in the forced cry of helplessness . For the cry of helplessness is an appeal in extremis . The extreme appeal communicates " enough , no more " ; it asks the torturer to let be . The appeal to be let be is a groan of submission just short of physical death , and yet it comes close to destroying selfhood in its idiocy , that is , its resistance to determinate objectification . Or the appeal may be in the silent eyes that say " enough , no more . " The eyes or the groan say " Please " ? they helplessly plead against the despoiling of the inward intimacy . Torture seeks the degradation of the vulnerability of appeal . If torture is a hatred of hiddenness , it is the other 's hiddenness that is hated , while the torturer keeps himself to himself in his own hiddenness . ( " Keeping oneself to oneself " is another expression of the elemental selfrelativity I spoke of previously . ) The torturer wants to objectify the other , but seeks himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of selfhood , mystery which the torturer reserves for himself alone . Hence the attack will be on the most intimate parts of the body , and not just against the parts most vulnerable to pain and suffering , though in fact the most intimate and the most vulnerable tend to coincide . The mouth will be pillaged , as in extracting teeth without anaesthetic , or exposing and probing the roots of nerves in the gums . The violation of mouth makes the victim helpless to cry out ; even the appeal of the body will be stifled . Or the assault will be against those parts of the flesh most vulnerable to uncovering and nakedness . The " private parts " become the focus of this hatred of hiddenness . The private , intimate parts used to be called the pudenda , the shameful parts . My point does not concern whether there is an inappropriate shame about the body ; there is . But shame is the shadow of the sense of modesty which is the incarnate expression of the intimate reserve of the self : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will . The torturer wants to shame that freedom in degrading the private parts . The private parts are ambiguous , in being both most sensitive to touch and most subject to pain . This ambiguity provides the opening in the flesh for the torturer to launch his assault on the intimacy , not only of the body , but of self-being . It is the intimacy of self-being that is shamed in the shaming of the shameful parts . // Think of the elemental neccesity of the body having to relieve itself . Think of our vulnerability in this , and the demands of modesty and dignity that we do this in private and alone . Its idiocy asks intimacy . But one is deprived of this by the torturer . It is mocked . Of course , foul horrors , worse by far , and nameless , are visited on the intimacy of the flesh . Schopenhauer spoke of the genitals as the metaphysical organs . And while his metaphysics needs modification , we can say that the torturer 's violation of the private parts is essentially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is here effected : not just violence on the body , not just the assault on dignity , nor just the destruction of inherent worth , but the trampling on the trace of infinity in the idiocy of the self . There is to be nothing sacred at all . Torture serves the kingdom of death that hates every trace of the divine . Torture incarnates a metaphysical necrophilia . But necrophilia , we must remember , is a mode of " being with " : it is being with the dead , it is community with death . The complete desecration of the intimacy of being would be the necrophiliac community with death . If we now turn to love , compare the groan of tortured pain to the groan of erotic pleasure . Qua sounds there might be little quantitative difference between the two . Even qua groans of pain and pleasure there might seem little between them : both involve retractions of selfhood to the elemental ; both are idiotic and at the edge of conceptual mediation . But one bespeaks a going beyond oneself in self-transcending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intimate self back into the unbearable void of its own suffering . Nor are the groans mere immediacies that are indefinite , or empty of meaning . They are elementals that are already overdetermined , and bespeak in a complex togetherness between self and other . In love , as opposed to torture , we find respect for the reserve of the beloved who is allowed to be in its own intimacy of being . The other will be let recede , since freedom is the allowance of withdrawal . The modesty of love is the mindfulness that self-disclosure moves on an equivocal boundary , where the intimacy of being opens itself to possible acceptance or despoliation . Modesty guards the intimacy of selfhood in its infinite reserve . Love lets that modesty be ; there is no profanation in love . If the intimacy is to come to self-disclosure , this must be let be as genuinely free for itself . Love then is a welcoming of the intimacy that never forces . Such a forcing would force modesty back over the other side of self-disclosure , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem unbroken . We all have experienced those surprising moments in conversation when suddenly we realize that the other is no longer there , even though the talking continues . The other communicates but has withdrawn from the commuThe // nication ; the intimacy of being has reserved itself . Or we communicate with another , and there are moments when we know we have just leaped over a gap or abyss whose silence has been disguised by the slight quickening of breath , or of the pace of speaking . The surface is all self-disclosure , but we are startled by subtle indeterminacies requiring extraordinary finesse to hear , indeterminacies into whose space the intimacy of the self has been withdrawn . Indeed there may be intimacies into which the idiotic self is so withdrawn that they are secret to its own self-consciousness . This self creates a conversation within itself which hides other silences wherein a deeper intimacy of selfhood has been retracted . Love of the other may be necessary to reopen these retractions . On its own the self may be unable to open up its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other towards one 's own selfopening . There is no way to force the other to reveal and give itself with the longed-for presence . Every effort to force the lover , betrays the love and the lover . Hence there can be no technique of love , though technique may produce the simulacrum of love . It will work on the surface of intimacy , but already this signals the death of intimacy . The intimacy of being by its very nature is absolutely reserved to technique . Where technique is , the idiocy of selfhood is not , and there is no love . I might , of course , be deceived by the simulacrum technique produces . I do not know it but I am objectified and manipulated . I am " taken in , " as we say . I am seduced or let myself be seduced . The heart is such a great need of love that it will give itself up thus . Its being taken in , its giving itself up may be deluded . Even this delusion will mimic the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself be deceived , though in another recess of the intimacy of being , one is not entirely deceived . Such self-deception is a hiding from oneself what one recess of intimacy knows , knows beyond the intimacy of being that is closer to honest mindfulness . Opposed to the forced submission of the torture victim , the giving up and giving over of love will be a willing giving to the other . If subsequently this willing is shown to be betrayed , the experience can be crushing . The idiocy of being comes out here too . The self retracts its trust . Being crushed , or disappointed , or betrayed , all these reveal the intimacy of being in a reversal of the directionality of self-opening transcendence . As there is no technique , there is no systematic science relative to being crushed , or being disappointed , or being betrayed . They are idiotic , outside system . One need only think about how the wound of a significant disappointment , just in its closeness to the heart , may significantly influence the entire life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that wound so decisively shaped the self-hecoming of that person . It may become hidden even from the self it so shapes , so c lose to the self it eludes self-knowledge . // There can he a certain betrayal of trust that is metaphysically indistinguishable from torture . In each such case , the inward otherness of the intimate self is crushed . This is why the betrayed person may feel himself " tortured by the betrayal , " so deep may run the sense of violation . If a friend or parent or spouse betrays one , the energy of self-trancendence that comes alive in trust may be reversed and the intimate self be sent into a tailspin of withdrawal . It recoils back on itself , away from any giving over of itself to the other . The more intimate the given trust , the more violent the betrayal on innerness , the more convulsive the retreat . In another sense , the torture of betrayal can be more crushing than the torture of torture . The torturer is explicitly an enemy , does not present himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the intimacy of the friend , the intimacy of an intimate , that has wounded us , or being wounded by us. 9 . The Field of Intimacy The idiocy of being can not be confined to closed innemess because there is a field of intimacy . Singular figures , significant particulars haunt one 's world . These are not items in one 's environment , nor simply " significant others . " They emanate a texture of real presence . A person inhabits one 's world to the point of also inhabiting the intimacy of one 's own being . The other radiates a certain aura , shimmers in a space of thereness in an entirely personal and unique way . The language of the senses seems unavoidable . There is a musk of self , a shining of self . There is a radiance of intimacy that is idiotic . I am sitting in an empty room , my back to the door . Of a sudden I know I am not alone . There is a tingle along the bones , a presence sensed before sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence is intimated before announced , known before identified , identified before named . This is a knowing of the other 's presence that is not a determinate knowing . How do I know that the emptiness is no longer empty ? It is as if my solitude is a field of intimacy , and as a field of intimacy it is not a field of solitude . It is a space of intimacy into which another steps as a radiance of intimacy . The field of intimacy is modified by this radiance of the other , even before the other is determinately known , communicated simply by being there , even before being announced . Or there is an " announcement " of the other self that is prior to all determinate announcements . The very being there is a self . The self is this immediate announcement of presence , a presence that is absence , if all announcements are reduced to objectifiable determination . // The field of intimacy is filled with the entrance of an unknown other who , in stepping into it , radiates a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the unknown other may be known , for I may know who is behind me , unseen , as yet unrecognized . I exclaim : " It is you ? I knew it all along ! " This happens ; we all know this happens ; and there is an excess to determination in this intimation of the other . How does a room change when another enters thus ? Travelers in a remote wilderness experience something similar when they come upon unmistakeable traces ? the tingle along the spine , not devoid of foreboding , says : the presence of the human . In the pragmatic world the strangeness of presence settles into habitual presence . Sameness receives primary notice ; singularity shades off into the background . This is the daily averaging of singularities . The self of the other is standardized in relatively predictable roles , domesticated by long familiarity . We say we have a handle on that person . The word " handle " names well the instrumentalization of selfhood , its manipulability , literally its availability to handling ( manus : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idiotic singularity is a nothing . It is a no place , a self that can not be placed . Nor can the field of intimacy be placed in that order . It is another place . I can domesticate the singularity of others , the others can do it to me , I can do it to myself . The " nothingness " of self-being strikes one as strange , outside the economy of habitual manipulation . And yet , even in the domestication of presence , the intimacy of self radiates into relatedness to the other , for the other radiates an intimacy of its own into the between . Whether we domesticate it or not , the between is the field of intimacy . Suppose we lose a long accepted friend . Now the unique aura of this other is not there any more . The field of intimacy is shaken . The sense of absence is the sense of presence mourned . I grieve the loss of this intimate self ; I grieve what was all but nothing in the pragmatic world of habitual sameness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I see it . The absence of passing away puts me in mind of the presence that was then absent to mind , just because it was so present . We were too close to real presence : not close , we were in it as a field . Death and loss and distance allow us to sense what was there all along , but missed all along , in its being taken for granted . When we miss it in loss , we then begin to find it , perhaps even for the first time . Of course , the finding is quickly lost , since the singularity of the intimate is hard to fix , beyond its recall in the form of memorable similarities . The pragmatic order quickly regains its sway ? as if there were no mystery to all this presencing and withdrawing , this unmasterable coining and going . // The field of intimacy is not confined to human being . Other beings have their singularity , their radiance , their aura of ontological presence . Think of the difference between a scientific account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration of place or landscape . We can give a more or less scientific account of a place in terms of its geology , its geography , the botany of its flora and fauna , the biology of its inhabitants . But in the poetic rendition , the intimacy of place transcends the particularities of environment , made intelligible by a set of universals common to other similar environments . It is this place , not that , which is celebrated . It is loved in the singularity of its singularity . A person can come to love a place in such a way that a rapport is set up between him and it , and the things of daily commerce within that place . A human being can have a peculiar tenderness towards a place , as if the place claimed him as home , as if he belonged to the place , rather than the place belonging to him . This being at home in the place of home is the community of the intimacy of being . An artist speaks the word of home in that sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placelessly , in the name of an anonymous space . The speaking of the artist is agapeic naming . It speaks the singular name . This rapport is brought to mind in the loss of a place . The loss of place can be a loss of self . One has lost one 's place ; one is retracted to the idiocy of one 's own being , again at a loss , because one has lost the rapport with the otherness of the place . What is this rapport ? We are at ease in a place , or disturbed by it ; we breath its air ; the place presses on one , impresses itself , or fails to communicate . We speak of the spirit of a place as its genius . This has been lost in the modern instrumentalization of place . There is no time to find our home in the elusive , evanescent , shimmering of happening . In the place of home , there is a passing back and forth between oneself and the place . One is abroad in the place ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one finds an intimacy at play in the between . I look at the mountain and I am spread out on it ; I gaze at the sea and I am turmoiled by its roil ; I am out of myself in place . And place implaces itself in me ; the mountain is within . The mountain consumes me , towers over me , is an admonishment . There is no dualism ? the restless sea sings in me . Is this a complete equivocation ? I prefer to think of it as a creative doubleness , in the sense of a doubling or redoubling of one in the other . In the between , I and other pass into each other , and are able to be both . There is a " being both . " There is a community beyond univocity ; there is a being both without a dialectical subordination of one to the other ; I would call it a metaxological double . We can live this and not know it . The metaxological names the manyness of what is there in the intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 . Idiotic Likening One can not deny the gap of communication between someone mindful of the field of the intimate and someone dwelling predominantly in the world of habitual sameness . It is hard to get through to the second what is at play there . I can try to communicate , but the communication can not be successful if it is confined to generalities . Success only comes if my interlocutor calls upon the memory of the idiotic in his or her own life , and recognizes that I , too , am somewhere like that . " Like that " ? what does this mean ? " Likeness " suggests a number of possibilities , but two main ones are relevant here . First , likeness can be the instrument of a generality , a means towards an anonymous universal . A is like B because both share in a similar characteristic , C , which is singular to neither . Hence , their likeness points to a commonness other to the singularity of either ; this likeness subordinates the singularity of both . A second possibility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularity , and so point in a very different direction to commonality as defined in terms of anonymous universality . A is like B , and the likeness means that the singularity of A and B is like , precisely in a community of irreducible singularities . To say " we are the same " means " we are both irreplaceable . " We are alike in that each of us in community is an absolute singularity , even in our relativity . This likeness is a relativity that frees the sameness from reduction , and returns each singulairity back to its singularity again . This likeness of community is a sameness that dissolves reductive homogeneity , a sameness that releases its own homogeneity back to irreducible heterogeneity . In the first case , when I say to you " It was like this , " likeness does name an intermediate condition ? it is , so to say , a halfway house towards a common characteristic that will function as the sign of a generality . My friend 's child has died . I say : ? oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet that the death of fathers is such a likeness , such a generality . The tale of generations is the common story of lost fathers and grieving sons , repeated again and again ? all said by Claudius with the intent to rob the singularity of Hamlet 's grief of its singular intimacy . They are all alike means here : they are all the same really , indifferently the same . The commonness of the universal admonishes Hamlet to put off his unmanly grief and become a stone . It is worth looking a little more closely . Hamlet 's mother give him this advice : Gertrude : Do not forever with thy lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust . Thou knows't ' t is common ; all that lives must die , Passing through nature to eternity . // Hamlet : Aye , Madam , ' t is common . Gertrude : If it be , Why seems it so particular with thee ? ( Hamlet I , ii , 69 ? 75 ) Note the contrast of the common with the particular , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature and eternity ? true certainly , but not true to the particularity of a grief , and hence untrue . Hamlet rejects the " seeming " particularity of his grief . " Seems , Madam . Nay it is . I know not seems ' . " He is , in fact , speaking of the idiocy of being when he goes on to say : " But I have that within which passes show/These but the trappings and the suits of woe . " This is intimacy beyond objectification . Claudius repeats the lesson of the common : But , you must know , your father lost a father , That father lost , lost his , ... ( Hamlet I , ii , 89 ? 90 ) But he , fratricide , usurper , incestuous seducer , goes further : he arraigns the singularity of Hamlet 's grief before eternal necessity , before Heaven itself : But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness ; ' t is unmanly grief ; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven , A heart unfortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd . For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense , Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart ? Fie ! ' T is a fault to heaven , A fault againt the dead , a fault to nature , To reason most absurd , whose common theme Is death of fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first corse till he that died today , " This must be so . " ( Hamlet I , ii , 92-106 ) It is interesting how the how of a saying can corrupt the truth of a said . Note how Claudius instrumentalizes the intimacy of being in the interests of his own will to power . He uses almost exactly the opposite argument with Laertius , when he loses his father ( see , Hamlet IV , vii , 108ff . ) . He manipulates Laertius by whipping up the singularity of his grief to make him want to kill Hamlet ( " To cut his throat i ' th ' church . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish Claudius ' own aim . As a philosophy , stoicism suggests a similar petrification of the intimate , when it reduces the death of a child to a general theme in the human // condition . It happens to us all . Death has become an It ? the singularity of every death is neutralized , because universalized . The Stoic enjoins a retreat to the innerness of selfhood where he claims to find a fastness and security beyond the vicissitudes of externality . And yet he risks reification of the " like this " into oblivion of the intimacy of being . Stoic self-security is undermined by what a less neutering return to innerness reveals : the idiocy of being upsets all inner self-security of the sort the Stoic craves . For in the idiocy of being , there is an otherness of innemess which heightens mindfulness of the frailty of singular being , not only the vulnerability of its own self , but the fragility of the other . This is even more so , when we mind self and other as singulars of infinite worth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop of infected water will maim or drive mad or kill , makes us less ontologically secure rather than more . The sheer " onceness " of singularity floats as if it were an absolute center of being over the abyss of nothing . This absolute center is all but nothing ; and yet in its absolute vulnerability it is not nothing : it is . There is no security in this : " It is . " For the idiocy of being means : It was not once , it is now for the while of the between , it will not be once again . So in case of the second possibility above noted , the words " like this , " can be said otherwise than as a pointer to the neutral universal . The likeness points to the this as this , not to the sameness as a sameness . Like you I lost a father ; but the thisness of my grief puts me in mind , not of grief as a generality , but of the thisness of this grief that now racks you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likeness of an intimacy . The between is itself qualified by an intimacy which is not the exclusive possession of you or I. This qualification , in fact , constitutes community as personal . Silence and reserve are also necessary . The habitual words of consolation are dangerous . For it is not just their standardized content that is the important thing , but the who and the how of their saying . I say : " My sympathies to you " ? standardized consolation . But the very " this " of the person saying , and the " this " of the how of saying , all these make an enormous difference to the commonality that comes to be in the word of solidarity . For I can say all the right words , but in an absolutely wrong way ? then the word of solidarity fails , even in its visible success . Example : A priest at a funeral speaks all the right words of ritual consolation . But he speaks the right words as an ecclesiastical functionary , not as an I. But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that survive . It is the community of intimacy created by common grief that calls for address with the word of solidarity . But the word of community is uttered functionally by a functionary . All the right words now become all the wrong words , from the standpoint of t he t hisness of this grief . // Determinate scientific universals articulate , to the best extent possible , the habitual samenesses , both of things and of our thinking . Things have their habits ; our thinking has its habits . These are the publicly standardized modes of commonness . All this is proper to the intelligibility of beings . But this is not all . There are ways of being and mind proper to selfbeing and other-being , on the other side of the standardized sameness . Such is the likeness that is a gesture of welcome towards memory of the intimate . Thus , through the remembered grief which can not be shared , there is a sharing of a grief . The comforter tries to be the bearer of shared grief towards this person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing is agapeic . The first sense of likeness may be made the basis of a " scientific " psychology whose " findings " may be more or less true , relative to some standardized version of humanity . But this is radically incomplete relative to the idiocy of selfhood , and radically false , if it holds it has the truth of selfhood . The second sense of likeness is the essential basis of a community of being that does not disrespect the intimate ; it grieves and rejoices with it ; it points to home , even in the agony of not being at home . This " likening " hears the call of a beyond that is beyond all likeness , and with which we are in community . This demands agapeic mind , be it in philosophy , or in life itself . 11 . Idiotic Metaphysics I will shortly turn to agapeic mind , but let me conclude with a remark on the significance of the above for philosophical saying . Nietzsche claimed that the opposition of Plato and Homer was life 's basic antagonism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated it . For there is a philosophical art that , even in its logical pursuit of the universal , seeks not to betray the singular in its proper singularity , nor the community of saying even between antagonistic human seekers . This art is suggested by the Platonic dialogue itself . It is as if Plato himself is the internal tension between art and science . Plato reveals the tense communication of " Plato " and " Homer , " in Nietzsche 's sense . The standard opposition of art and science is presented in terms of the contrast of the particular and the universal . It seems to me that the idiocy of being demands a kind of metaphysical thinking transcending this standard contrast . Science does have a drift towards the general , even when its evidences are garnered from the particularities of the given . It tends towards general explanatory schemes or cognitions that intend a universal range of reference , none of which are to be confined to the particular as particular . // Art genuinely evidences a tolerance of otherness and embodies a rich way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 13 Nietzsche is so far right . It is not that philosophers must give up general analysis and become writers of poems . They may do this , but this is still to accept the standard contrast . Rather the sense of being manifest with the idiocy of the " this " must be let pose its challenge to philosophy , must be let seep into the sources of thinking its otherness . No prescription can be offered of the thinking that might result , were we to allow the idiotic to seep into metaphysical mindfulness . There can be no method or analytical technique here . The intimacy of being points to an idiotic source beyond determinate thinking . To ask for a method would be already to determine this source , in advance of the challenge it might pose to metaphysics , and hence to domesticate this challenge before it is even allowed to pose itself . We do not give up determinate thought , but this source in idiocy must be let sprout , and in the determination of metaphysical thinking itself . Certainly the categorial pigeonholing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to advocate their confused promiscuity , but a certain philosophical fidelity . The fidelity may sometimes demand resort to metaphysical metaphors , or concepts that are mindful of their own imagistic nature . If the idiocy of being makes an intimate claim on the philosopher , one can not escape into the thought of mind in general . The singularity of the philosopher has to be acknowledged . One must deny oneself the consolation of denying oneself . Even such a consolation is equivocal , since one is still oneself as consciousness in general , even while claiming to have put oneself aside as this thinker . Paradox is hard to avoid , for there is a kind of loss of self in the return to singularity ; but this is not a return to the ego , but to the I as abroad in the field of the intimacy of being . In other words , there is an energizing of the sources of agapeic mind which loves the particular as particular , and as for itself , and not simply for the subjective ego . The " loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this willingness of the singular Ito be mindfulness for the other , to be this singular source of radical self-transcendence towards the other in its otherness . This is what I call agapeic mind , not nameless mind in general . Properly speaking , metaphysical thinking and aesthetic openness both are concretions of agapeic mind , which is mindfulness for the other in its otherness , and yet also in its community with the intimacy of the I. It is relevant to recall again Plato 's repeated reliance on the story and image . This is not a mere concession to the many , who are incapable of the pure selfless thought of unindividualized eide . It is a necessity because we
