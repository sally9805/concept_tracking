<p> By title , Gennady Budkin is deputy director of one of this city 's oldest toy factories . What he does much of the day , however , is find food for his workers . <p> Last week , for instance , Budkin lent a truck to a nearby grocery store and got a load of margarine and mandarin oranges in return . Earlier , he swapped some of his factory 's light bulbs for meat and traded the work of a team of plumbers for vegetables . <p> Meanwhile , his factory is producing fewer and fewer toys , of lower and lower quality . <p> Such is the case in factories across the land as the Soviet economy has stumbled into a breathtaking free fall . Commerce is grinding to a halt , and production of virtually everything , from fuel to foodstuffs , is down sharply . <p> People still go to work , but they spend progressively less time making things and more time looking for food and worrying about survival . Factories operate , but , with the collapse of the centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials they were promised and must barter for what they need . Reductions in fuel and electricity have forced cutbacks as well . <p> At Budkin 's Malish Toy Factory , for instance , the Moscow city authorities recently cut the daily electricity supply by 30 percent , forcing drastic cuts in already declining production . Throughout the country , toy stores , which have long seemed sparse and uninteresting by American standards , have grown even drearier . <p> " It is a very difficult time now , " said Malish director Sergei Mosiakin , looking exhausted by it all . " We may be coming to the situation where we will have no raw materials and can make no toys , and we 'll say , ' Okay , let 's close down . ' It 's not only that I get tired of dealing with things I 'm not competent to deal with , but we are losing the quality of our product . " <p> For decades , Malish has been making molded plastic toys  --  blow-up animals , painted figurines , little trains  --  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the factory received its production ingredients from Azerbaijan , Ukraine , Byelorussia and Russia according to a central-government mandated plan , produced its toys in a quantity and at a price set by the plan and sold them to stores selected by the plan . <p> The plan still exists , but , with the splintering of the country since the failed reactionary coup in August and the decision by governments of former Soviet republics to move to a free-market system , no one follows it , and no one enforces it or wants to . The result is that from day to day , Mosiakin , Budkin and others at Malish have no idea what working conditions will be like , except that there will certainly be scarcity . The factory produced 12 million toys last year ; this year it will produce only 9 million , and next year is likely to be much worse . <p> It has been months since the factory has gotten the plastics and paints it needs from suppliers to make the toys attractive . As a result , colors are drab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molds are used . A little samovar that should be bright red is a muddy brownish-pink ; beach balls , rather than bright primary colors or pastels , are black , green or white . <p> The factory no longer produces a popular little plastic train because the model , of the low-quality type sold for a couple of dollars in U.S. drugstores , is too complicated and uses up too much plastic . Making anything better is out of the question because the factory uses equipment so old that " nobody in the world still uses it , " Mosiakin said , and it takes forever to get it repaired , especially now when there are no spare parts . <p> Mosiakin said he was amazed recently when an American toy manufacturer came to visit and left a small Ninja fighter figurine as a sample . " The colors are so good , " he marveled , pointing to the sharp white , black and brown of the three-inch-high figure . " We just can not make those kinds of details , " he said , pointing to the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosiakin said is that his suppliers also have difficulties . Sometimes the stumbling blocks are purely political , as in the case of a Byelorussian supplier who said he will not send any more polyethylene to Russian firms until the Russian republic makes good on promised oil supplies that should have arrived long ago . " I ca n't really criticize , " Mosiakin said with a shrug . <p> Mostly , however , his suppliers are also facing shortages and , like the rest of the country , are bartering what they make to get what they need . His factory is forced to do the same , but in a time of desperate basic industrial needs , it often finds its toys are not in great demand . <p> " When we go to suppliers and say we have toys , they look at us and say , we need steel , cement or glass . So to get what this factory needs I have to engage in a three-way barter  --  selling toys to a store in Kazakhstan , where they have a shortage of toys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take those to the supplier and get the plastisol that I need , " said Mosiakin , referring to a thermoplastic coating material . " That 's how everyone works now . " <p> Often lately , the needed raw materials have been so scarce that sections of the factory have had to stop working . This , he said , is the hardest part , because for the first time , his factory might have to do the unimaginable  --  lay off some of its 300 employees . <p> On the other hand , he said , he also must struggle to keep people on the job instead of foraging for food to keep their families going . What food there is in the nearby stores is sold out by the end of the workday , and hours of waiting bring no guarantee of success . The other night , a milk store across the street from the factory had a three-hour-long line of anxious parents and old people wrapped in heavy coats against the cold . <p> As a result , when Malish workers , most of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find being sold , whether milk or meat or butter or eggs , they sometimes simply abandon their posts and rush to get in line . <p> " I ca n't stop workers from going to the stores during the day , " said Mosiakin . " Even if I stand guard right at the gate , they go . " <p> Faced with growing absenteeism and desperate to keep their workers on the job , Mosiakin and other plant administrators followed the example of factories across the country and began scrounging for food for their employees . They set up " frienship contracts " with neighboring food stores to provide them with toys and assistance in exchange for food . Now , a good part of every day is spent on this kind of barter . <p> Last week , for instance , every worker got a pound of butter and some margarine , commodities so scarce that most families have to do without them for weeks . Other days , they got onions and garlic . <p> On Friday , Mosiakin and Budkin were working the phones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other basics for next week , and to see if any of the food stores , in exchange , needed their trucks or maintenance workers to fix ceilings or broken lights . One store recently borrowed a truck to pick up 1,500 pounds of meat from a food depot and gave Malish half the meat in return . It was then divided among the workers , administration , engineers and a few subcontractors . <p> " In previous years , our priority was to give workers enough money and let them find food for themselves , " Budkin said . " Now that 's all changed . We have to help our workers find food . Our main concern is that our workers can do as much as they can here without having to spend hours in lines or worrying about where they will be able to get food . " <p> Even so , life is difficult for those who work at Malish . <p> " They try to provide us with food , but of course I worry about it like everyone does . Especially I worry for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been working at Malish for 16 years and earns an average monthly wage of 650 rubles  --  less than $ 7 at the current tourist exchange rate . She recalled how years ago , all employees received regular packages of special foods at work , which on holidays included caviar and good fish , now the stuff of dreams . <p> Today , she said , she is happy to get anything . " Right now our life is like that , " she said , as she bent over a machine that affixes air valves to plastic blow-up toys . " Everyone is nervous all day . "
