When Mother got close to talk , I moved away . There was n't anything wrong with Mother . Not really . She still had a pleasant smell about her  --  Moonlight Rose , I think . Her body was attractive , for an older woman . <p> Maybe that was my problem . My friends were always telling me that she looked too young to be my mother . A cousin or an older sister , maybe . At first , when I 'd hear those words from deacons at church or greasy mechanics or clerks at the store ( always men , always ) , I 'd smile and look up at her and smile again . They 'd look from her to me and me to her and shake their heads . " Uncanny , " they 'd say . But now that my friends had remarked on our resemblance , I felt uneasy about it . I did n't want to be like her . Stabbed in the back by my own mother . How could I talk to her , anyway ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He made $5 last Sunday at the Simpson 's barbeque , " she 'd say . Or , " I swear , I swear ... kids sure do take to Jimmy . " <p> Jimmy , that was his godawful name . <p> I was walking home from school thinking about Mother , thinking about school just thinking in general about me when the crunchy sound of gravel on the road interrupted my thoughts . I 'd heard the same noise at night . The sound grated on my nerves , making me think again of Mother , and of talking to her . I did n't want to talk to her . She would win , and I wanted to show her that I did n't need her like I did when I was a small child . <p> I put the school books down , pressed my spine against a fat , brown leafy tree , and tried to think about Mother and how she was when Dad was alive  --  before the gangrene had set in his foot , bloating it up real scary big . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said emphysema , a funny sounding word . Sometimes when I was thinking about Daddy she would say , " You use to tell me you loved me , before . What happened ? " <p> I 'd say , " Nuthfin , " to irritate her . I 'd been saying nuthfin this and nuthfin that , and I ai n't gon do dis nor dat . Just trying to mess with her . She wanted us kids to speak proper English . And that 's what all my friends were saying  --  Nuthfin . Somebody would ask you for a sip of soda and you 'd say , " Nuthfin . " The boys began calling the teachers " nuths " because nuthfin came out of their mouths that we could use . <p> You see , there was this big campaign going on by some town folks to help the hill folks speak better . Us . If a child went the entire month speaking good English , we got a free ticket to the cinema . All Mother had to do was say we 'd been talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the words they wanted to hear , and <p> could go . But she would n't . <p> Lately , Mother had been asking about the cuts and pricks on the back of my blouses . ( Between a paragraph or two of Jimmy , Jimmy , Jimmy , and Jimmy . ) It could drive you crazy . She was always smiling and laughing and looking in the mirror . Humming bits of songs to herself  --  songs I 'd heard over the radio  --  teenagers ' songs . Preening , I think my grandmother would have called it . She started wearing my scarfs , especially the multicolored ones . When I would ask her , " Why are you stealing my stuff ? " she 'd say , " Stealing , stealing ? Look here girl , who buys this stuff anyway ? " ( She 'd spread her arms out wide , twirling her hands a bit . ) She 'd forgotten that granddad had bought everything in his house . <p> We moved here about a year ago , after the social worker in Wedowee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us kids . " Your neighbors were concerned , " she 'd said . Mother had forgotten how she had n't bought any food , or cooked anything for that matter . Everything to do with the house had fallen on somebody else . One of the neighbors had told . She 'd forgotten , or had amnesia or something . I do n't know because we do n't talk too much about the time after Daddy died . <p> The branches on either side of the road closed off the sky , like a shutter or something , and all I could see were bits of peeking blue . Baby blue and white were my high school colors . My favorites . That 's why I 'd joined the cheerleading squad . I had missed practice , claiming I had cramps , even though my stomach was hurting . I should have gone directly home to talk to Mother . He would be there , though . <p> The ice man came from up north . Mother wanted to go up north . So she learned about the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big breaks there . Everybody in town talked to him about it , making him out to be a big shot . He delivered ice to the hill people and told bits of gossip on everybody . His baggy overalls ( that 's what he wore everyday ) sagged in the butt every time he carried the ice from the wagon to dump it on somebody 's back porch . A floppy hat covered the red plaid rag tied around his slicked hair ( a do'rag , they called it up north ) . For the last four months , he 'd spent Saturday nights with Mother . From my grandfather 's stone house , I would watch him drive up the hill and stop at the foot of grandfathers thirty steps to take the do'rag off , pat his hair . The light from the moon magnified his hairdo , which glistened like the sweat I 'd seen on a black coal miner 's back after an accident . Us kids would run to the mine when the alarm rang , and we 'd watch as body after crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hills went to town ( it was called Cinderella ) to work in the mine , except Mother 's ice man . I guess he was n't really a hill man , but he hung out with them . He had more spending money than the coal miners , and my grandfather , his bottom lip filled with Skoal tobacco , called him a " city slicker . " <p> The ice man and Mother and their togetherness and my hating it and hating them and hoping I 'd never be like them  --  that 's what had happened . She had never behaved that way with Dad . <p> The ice man was different from my father , not how I 'd pictured a grown-up man to be . The ice man 's fingernails were manicured . The ice man and my dad were both funny , though ; they could make anybody laugh . I heard the ice man talking to Mother , telling her about the people up north , pinching his nose to sound like them , walking with his shoulders swinging low , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Before I 'd known it , I was laughing , too . <p> That time after Dad 's death was too crazy . Mother scared me . I missed my Dad just like she did , but I was n't all screwed up . She was . And , quiet as it 's kept , Mother did n't know Daddy too much longer than I did . What right did she have to miss him more or lose her mind because he was gone ? How was her pain more ? Why 'd she hide in the house ? <p> I 'd done my homework : Fast chick that she was , they 'd gotten married when she was five months pregnant with me in February , 1935 . And I 'd heard my grandma say that Mother had only known Daddy a month before getting pregnant . So I added it up , she 'd only known Daddy 10 months longer than me . Why 'd she stop eating and sleeping after he died ? The dirty dishes on the floor . Trash . Clothes everywhere . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the walls . People said a young wife could n't take all that pressure . What about us ? She was embarrassing . <p> The dirt along the road was red , and everywhere else in Cinderella too . I could n't imagine dirt any other way . The dirt reminded me of mud pies and the house we 'd lived in most of our lives , before coming to Cinderella . Daddy had died two years ago , and Mother still did n't mention him by name . I closed my eyes and pictured Daddy 's hands scooping the red dirt , kneading it like dough for mud pies , rubbing it all over me in a dirt fight . I missed Daddy and sometimes wished it had been Mother who died . <p> As I picked up the books , a squirrel raced quickly up the tree . I could throw something , kill it . In a way I wanted to tell Mother that I was pregnant , if only to hurt her for what she was doing . She always left me with the kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I did n't think she would really care about my being pregnant . <p> I hated the ice man . Once , a couple months ago , I saw him when I was leaving the house of Mr. Mills , the man I babysat for . He stopped the wagon and tried to talk to me . I really did n't care one way or the other about him then . He said he 'd take me home , but he got out of the wagon first . As I was standing there , watching him walk toward me with a not-a-care-in-this-world look , he pulled me to him and stuck his big slippery tongue down my throat . My tongue touched his , and it felt like the cabin walls . I did n't want him to kiss me , but I could n't stop him . He was ugly . I could smell his cologne , and I could see the hairs inside his ears . My blouse was wet from the ice poking me in the back . He started grinding against me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , all the while watching a red bird on a branch just above staring down at us . My body was hot , and I perspired . I did n't like him then anymore than I had before , but he was kissing me and I was kissing him back , and I did n't want him to stop . It did n't seem to matter at that time who he was . The kissing , the grinding . <p> We did n't do anything more than that . He broke away , my arms fell to my sides , the bird flew away . In a matter of 15 seconds , my world had changed . I was afraid , afraid he 'd go farther and I would n't stop him , afraid he 'd think I had wanted him to touch me before this . Afraid we 'd get caught . But I knew I should have stopped . Was there something wrong with me ? He was an older man . I still did n't like him . I did n't ever want to see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd moved to Cinderella because my grandfather was sick and Mother wanted to see him one last time before moving north . You see , she 'd always had the North in her head . Mother did n't want the boys working in the coal mines as scrubs all their life . She 'd preach about the North  --  how we could buy a nice house and the girls could work in offices . I could take secretarial classes . Mother used to fret about the move up north , and talk about it constantly . At one point we 'd seemed like sisters , planning . The Delta Coal Mining Company had given Mother $3,000 insurance money for Dad 's death . She said it was our start . <p> I kept walking up the road to the bottom step of grandfather 's stone house and stopped . I 'd forgotten to pick up the babysitting money from Mr. Mills , who had left word for me to stop by his home on the way home . I probably would n't be able to go by there anymore . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man who lived up in the hills . He had half-breed children and you had to use the outhouse . Last night Mother went to Gully 's Shack with the ice man  --  it 's an after hours place where they go to drink and dance and play cards . Sometimes Mr. Mills went with them . He liked to talk about people and how they fit . He 'd said , " Black folks do n't put on airs like white folks ; they are n't complicated . " I 'd wanted to ask him about that . I knew churchgoing black women who did n't speak to Mother anymore . What about those black folks ? Sometimes I 'd be in the house with the Mills kids and the ice man would come over in his ice wagon . We could hear the creaky wheels and the laughter . Mr. Mills and the ice man were friends . They 'd slap each other on the back and Mother would sit between them on the front seat . The kids and I stayed in the house until they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house from the homes of his three brothers . All four boys were trying to outdo each other , some said . They wanted the same girls . Grandfather wanted to keep his brothers away from his wife , so he built 30 stone steps to keep them away . You see , my grandfather liked a strong man . He said you can tell a good man by the way he comes up and down those 30 steps . The ice man was younger than Mother and he should have been able to climb those steps easily , but he could n't . He was slow . Everything he did was at a sleepy fly 's pace  --  even that afternoon . I would have told Mother about the baby last night , but she had brought Mr. Mills home and I got into the back of the wagon . They were giggling , and we passed by the red bird spot . I spent the night hugging my stomach and telling the baby we 'd never feel alone . <p> Charles Mills was in the backyard watering his collard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people ate . I knew they did n't eat greens and chittlings and necks bones and such . He had said once while mashing cornbread into the juice of the greens , " This food is the salt of the earth . " As he was watering those greens , I thought about what he had said then and about all his other peculiar white ways . His daydreaming and finger painting . He did n't wear underwear . <p> " Hello , Mr. Mills . " I waved my hand and sat on the back porch ledge of his house , swinging my legs back and forth real fast . It looked like one leg might unhitch itself from the joint and fly off . He stared at my legs , could n't take his eyes off them . A little pocket of spit collected in the corner of his mouth and the water in the hose rose in an arch . He took a huge breath just before walking toward me . The air had motorized his legs . His walk minded me of big bumpy trees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of his legs on top of mine was too much . He looked old . <p> He wiped his hand across his mouth and walked right up to me , and I smiled . " The kids have n't gotten home from school yet , Hollow woman . You 're kind of early yourself , are n't you ? " <p> He was always talking about the Hollow family  --  saying they were special , wishing he were one . My father was Johnny Hollow , and he was Sarah and George Hollow 's son . There were lots of Hollows in the hills , and they came from the old man Hollow who had willed his four black boys 56 acres of land even though they were born slaves and he was white with a proper family of his own ; their momma was a woman blacker than tar . That old white man Hollow had beat another man for hitting George 's momma . We do n't know her name  --  they claimed no one could pronounce it anyway . My grandfather said she was some good-looking woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and one , my great grandfather , kept her , had kids with her . He had his white family and his black family , and they say I have looks like hers that send a man wild . She had legs like rubber that could bend every whichaway . <p> Charles Mills said he 'd always been attracted to black women . The town people talk about him , especially the white women ; they say it 's a shame that a good-looking white man would waste his life with black folks . They blame it on his home training . His wife was black , but she left him after she had the last baby . <p> He would tell me a lot of things . I guess that 's what attracted me to him the most , not the way he looked . We had conversations . Once , when the kids were asleep and he had come home early from work , he told me about how he got started with black girls . <p> " I like asses , " he 'd said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palms of my hands . " <p> I 'd just sat there and looked at him . I did n't smile or anything or act like I shared the information he had . I had n't . He was talking about women in a way I did n't know . But he mentioned something crazy  --  " S-ing . " <p> " You see , " he 'd said , " me and my friends we had a code . S stood for negro girls and negro girls were for making it , so when somebody said they 'd been S-ing , the others could imagine the rest . " All the time he was talking it was like he was talking to himself , except every now and then he 'd rub my shoulder or hold me close . <p> " Baby doll , " he said , " I could n't get S-ing out of my mind . My friends thought I was crazy . S-ing was S-ing and dating an S woman was something else . A body has to know when to stop . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice man . That time was like my body was out of touch with my mind . So Mr. Mills no longer wanted white girls . He 'd tried to several times since I 'd been around . Says the pale skin makes him throw up . It looks wrinkly and ugly , and he hates those freckles . S-ing was n't the same ; the skin was not sweaty and moist . The girls were not S-shaped  --  skinny women with sharp bones that stuck into him from angles . <p> But I guess that was n't the worst of it . Mr. Mills got run out of his home town because he was n't just S-ing them . His friends started calling him nigger lover . His best friend had said one night , when they sat in the back of Charles Mills 's pickup truck , " It 's all right to fuck the bitches . You 're not supposed to like them . They 're niggers , for God 's sake . You fuck'em . Period . " <p> The funny thing was that now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relatives and even jobs , he still did n't have anything because black women did n't want to be seen with him . That 's how he 'd ended up with just me . <p> " I 've got ta go now . " Even though I 'd just gotten there and even though I knew he would n't want me to leave and I should be telling him about the baby anyway , I said I wanted to go . <p> My legs raced each other , and I kept my eyes down , looking at my lap while straightening the creases in my blue plaid skirt . He stood next to me and watched . <p> I did n't know what to do . I thought he 'd want me to stay with him , play house . " I should n't be here anyhow . My momma kills me she finds out I 'm here and your kids gone . " I could talk any way with him , and I did . He did n't care about proper English or proper manners or anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na talk to ya . You look ... that skirt . " He moved closer to me and stood between my legs . They stopped swinging . I was afraid to look right down into his face . I did n't want to cry . The muscles in his arms were bulging . He ran one finger down the outside of my leg to the ankle sock and gave one short tug . I remember the first time I 'd seen , him : He was running up grandfather 's 30 steps . <p> " Stop that . Quit ! " Part of me wanted him to continue . <p> He pulled again , and this time he slid his finger around my ankle and moved his hand up to cup the calf . It seemed like my muscles were reaching for his hand . I could n't no more stop him than I could the ice man , and the same warm liquidy feeling came all over my body . <p> " I said stop , ya hear ! You do n't know what 's wrong ... you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to have one . " <p> His hands stopped moving . <p> " I 'm going to have one , I said . " He looked at me . " A baby , that is . " Mr. Mills put his arm around my shoulders , I could see the sweat dripping from his forehead and feel its stickiness under his arms . <p> " No , Mr. Mills . No . Not this time . We ca n't do that no more . I just come to tell you ' bout it , that 's all . " I was crying little baby tears and he was holding me , and all I knew was that if my Daddy was there everything would be all right . <p> " Do n't go . " <p> " What you say ? " I said , hiccupping and crying at the same time . <p> " I said do n't go . Stay here . I 'll take care of you . " He pushed me back onto the floor and smoothed down the hair on my forehead . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with him on top of me , the world seemed full of wood and air and white flesh . " We can stay here together . " <p> " Here ... with you ? " <p> " With me . " <p> And he kissed me . So I thought about living in this cabin with his kids and being his wife and never telling Mother about the baby and letting Mother move up north without me  --  her and the old wood-tongue ice man . I did n't want to go there anyway . She could have her ice man , and I could have my baby , and I 'd be just like her way back when . Being pregnant and getting married and never telling the kid . Saying over and over to my friends when I 'm 20 and 30 and 40 ... quiet as it 's kept , I was two months pregnant when I got married to Mr. Mills . And he 'd be like my father or something , and I 'd keep calling him Mr. Mills because he did n't seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ' dirty diapers and sometimes , sometimes when there was n't anything to do , coming outside to the back porch looking for a piece of blue sky , a piece of Daddy  --  and instead finding big-eye 'd red birds on every rock and every tree branch , fence and even sitting on top of Mr. Mills 's collard greens . <p> Sheryl T.
