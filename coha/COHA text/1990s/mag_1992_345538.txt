Iowans may love favorite son TOM HARKIN , but last week on the eve of their caucuses , some of his neighbors were trading Harkin futures at just 8 cents . THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA has been operating a futures market in presidential prospects for students , faculty and staff . In the winner-take-all gamble , top share price is $1 ; the average investment is $15 . Traders at about 20 other college campuses , including UCLA , Caltech , Northwestern and the University of Virginia , will soon be able to play . So far , the market seems to be a better barometer than opinion polls . In 1988 , the day before the election , Bush shares were trading 8 percentage points higher than DukakisU  --  almost exactly his victory margin in the popular vote . Currently , Clinton is the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination , trading at 53 cents , followed by Kerrey at 14 cents . Tsongas is leading Harkin by nearly 2 cents ; Jerry Brown started well at a penny but has fallen to 0.4 cents .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
