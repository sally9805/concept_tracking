Section : Bigger Is Not Better <p> A colleague of ours ( we will call him Bill ) approached us at a conference seeking advice on selecting an air conditioner for his renovated home . Our recommendations included , " Be sure that the cooling load is calculated and that the air conditioner is sized to that load . " When Bill attempted to follow these instructions , only one of the four contractors would submit a sizing calculation ( two others just wanted to know how many square feet there were in the house ) . Bill hired the contractor who did the calculation and installed a high-efficiency , four-ton unit . Is this a success story ? Not really . <p> The contractor calculated a total cooling load of 37,580 British thermal units ( Btus ) per hour at 105degrees F outside and 70degrees F inside . While the cooling load he calculated could have been met by a three-and-a-half ton ( about 42,000 Btu ) air conditioner , the contractor convinced Bill to buy a four-ton unit " because then you will always have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cycles on and off more often and for shorter periods of time than it should ) even during the hottest weather and removes very little moisture from the air . What went wrong ? Three things : The contractor increased the actual maximum temperature difference between outdoors and indoors by more than 50% . The contractor added 20% to the calculated cooling load as a safety factor . The contractor selected a unit a half ton larger than his calculations warranted . <p> A two-and-a-half ton air conditioner would have been perfect for Bill 's house . Instead he paid more for an extra 1 1/2 tons of cooling . In addition to costing more to buy , Bill 's air conditioner will use more energy than a properly sized system , raising his utility bills ; it wo n't dehumidify the air as well as a smaller system would ; and chances are that Bill will be less comfortable . <p> Selecting the Right Air Conditioner . Before one can design an efficient and effective air conditioning system , the cooling load must be calculated using established techniques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manual J to estimate these loads . This is the standard method of sizing loads for residences . <p> If mistakes are made in the load calculations or the sizing method is flawed or incorrect data are used , the equipment will be incorrectly sized and will not perform as it should . <p> Field studies have shown that most equipment is substantially oversized compared to Manual J specifications . In the Model Energy Communities Project , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ( PG &E); found that 53% of the air conditioners checked were a ton ( about 12,000 Btu/hour ) or more oversized . A study by Pacific Northwest Laboratories found a third of the air conditioners to be a ton or more oversized . <p> Because optimum efficiency is achieved at continuous running , it is important that the air conditioner be sized to achieve the longest run times possible . Manual J specifies use of the so-called 2.5% design temperature as developed by the American Society of Heating , Refrigeration , and Air-Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) . A theoretically perfect-size air conditioner will run continuously for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than the 2.5% design temperature . For instance , a 2.5% summer design temperature of 100degrees F for Fresno , California , means that the temperature generally exceeds 100degrees F for only 73 hours in the season ( 0.025 x 2,928 hours in the months of June through September ) . During the rest of the time the air conditioner will cycle and operate at less than its potential efficiency . <p> A properly sized air conditioner should provide maximum value to the customer as well as a reasonable profit and further customer referrals for the contractor . If your air conditioner is cycling during the hottest afternoons of the summer , it is a sure sign it is oversized . ( Incidentally , if the air conditioner is running continuously on hot days , it does n't necessarily mean that it is the correct size . It is more likely that the duct system is leaky or the air flow across the inside coil is too low . ) <p> Why Are Air Conditioners Oversized ? Customers depend on the expertise of contractors in selecting an air conditioner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than necessary and often oversize by a ton or more . Even the most conscientious contractor is driven to avoid callbacks ( or even lawsuits ) . If the air conditioning system is n't working properly ( duct leaks , improper flow across the coils , improper charge ) , an oversize air conditioner can mask the problem . <p> Unfortunately , many customers think that " bigger is better , " so in a competitive situation , the contractor proposing the proper size unit may lose the bid . Contractors are hesitant to adopt an unfamiliar method of sizing when the methods they have developed over the years have served them well . It is no surprise then that air conditioners are oversized ; however , the advantages of a properly sized air conditioner are so large that these barriers need to be overcome . Customers pay a price for oversized air conditioners and , in many climates , lose comfort as well . <p> Air conditioners are very inefficient when they first start operation . It is far better for the air conditioner to run longer cycles than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioner increases the longer it runs . If the air conditioner is on only five minutes ( a fairly typical run time ) the energy efficiency rating ( EER ) is 6.2 . If , on the other hand , a properly sized ( 50% smaller ) air conditioner were used , the same amount of cooling would take place in less than 10 minutes , and the EER would rise to 6.9 . This represents an electricity savings of 10% for the customer . During most of the cooling season the cooling loads are well below the capacity of properly sized air conditioners , and for oversized units the short cycling is a substantial problem . Because it short cycles , Bill 's high-efficiency air conditioner is less efficient . <p> In addition , the ability of the air conditioner to remove moisture ( latent capacity ) is lowest at the beginning of the cycle . The moisture removed from the indoor air depends upon the indoor coil temperature being below the dew-point temperature of the air . The moisture then wets the indoor coil and , should the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil and be removed out of the condensate drain . For short cycles , the coil does not have time to operate at a cold enough temperature and , when the unit stops , the moisture on the coil evaporates back into the indoor air . Thus , in humid climates , a properly sized air conditioner will do a far better job of removing moisture from the air than an oversized unit . Bill 's oversized air conditioner could not remove enough moisture from the air , so his house was cold and clammy . <p> Also , the speed of the air blowing through the supply registers and the air being drawn into the return grille affects an air conditioner 's performance . If the air speed is too high , it will be noisy and uncomfortable , and the return grille filter effectiveness will be reduced . The speed through the grilles depends on the size of the air conditioner ( a larger unit has more air flow and higher air speed ) and the area of the grille ( a smaller grille causes higher air speed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to keep the air speed low and the noise at a minimum . Common complaints about oversized air conditioners are that they blast frigid air and that they are noisy . A properly sized air conditioner , with proper ductwork and grilles , will provide longer cycles , more consistent temperatures , and better mixing of the house air . Sizing Up the Calculations <p> In 1994 , Proctor Engineering Group compared over 40 different load calculation methods , submitted to PG &E; by manufacturers , distributors , and contractors , to Manual J. Manual J was used as a baseline because it is the most widely accepted load calculation methodology and is generally recognized as providing a safe estimate of cooling load . ( Some experts believe Manual J consistently overestimates the load by about 20% , as a built-in " safety " factor . ) <p> Most Contractors Oversize . The submitted calculations were all over the place . In the extreme , the calculated load was three times the Manual J calculated load . David , a contractor for over 20 years , shared some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the years . One method was to " buy the distributor 's overstock , " another was to " install the rejected unit from a previous job , " and still another was to " install the unit sitting in the truck or at the shop . " David referred to these methods as " sizing by cost . " <p> Contractors submitted methods that they sincerely believed would properly size air conditioners . Some of the methods , however , were based on information from as long as 40 years ago . These methods did not take into account the latest efficiency developments in building insulation , windows , and air tightness . The methods were often handed down from the person who taught them the business . Since the contractors had received few or no complaints of inadequate cooling , they considered their methods sufficient . Unfortunately , they were significantly oversizing units  --  particularly on newer , more energy-efficient homes . <p> A number of the methods did not calculate the " latent cooling load " of the home . Many assumed that the latent load was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box 16 . ) The actual latent load is highly dependent on the air tightness of the home , the local climate , and the interior moisture sources ( such as people ) . For hot , dry climates , the latent load will be far less than 30% of the sensible load , particularly if the house has a large amount of air leakage from the attic . For humid climates , the latent load can be higher than 30% of the sensible load if the house has a significant amount of air leakage . <p> In all cases , infiltration loads ( air leakage ) were not specifically addressed or were calculated by an oversimplified procedure . Contractors often assumed that infiltration rates were the same in all buildings or only depended on floor area . We now know that homes vary significantly in their leakage rate . <p> Duct Leakage . Cooling loads due to duct leakage are not included in any of the methods . However , duct leaks commonly raise home cooling costs by 20% to 30% . Duct leakage has three effects on design cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in capacity . Second , a return leak will often bring in superheated attic air . Third , the difference between supply leakage and return leakage will cause increased infiltration . While it is tempting to treat duct leakage as additional infiltration , the effect is actually more complex . <p> How should the loss due to duct leakage be taken into consideration when an air conditioner is sized ? The answer , of course , is simple . Do n't take duct leakage into account  --  fix the leaks . <p> Sizing By Square Foot . The " square foot per ton " sizing method avoids calculating the cooling load of the building and proceeds directly from the square footage of the building to the size of the air conditioner . No contractor submitted such a method for approval but a number of contractors reported that they often used this method , or knew others who did . In a study by the Florida Solar Energy Center , 25% of the contractors reported that they size by floor area . While this approach is rapid and simple , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the difference in surface area between a one-story and a two-story home of the same floor area , the differences in insulation and air leakage between different buildings , the number of occupants , and many other factors . In some cases contractors attempt to cover these variables by categorizing the home as low ( a new home in a moderate climate ) , average , or high ( an old home in a hot climate ) , but this method also falls short of properly sizing air conditioners . <p> Selecting Equipment . Manual J ( or other methods ) gives a contractor both the sensible and latent design loads for the house . A common , but wrong , practice is then to divide the total cooling load by 12,000 Btu/hour per ton and choose an air conditioner with that nominal tonnage . Nominal tonnage , however , does not indicate capacity under differing design conditions . Manual S provides a process for selecting equipment that will meet the sensible and latent load at Manual J design conditions . Both Manual J and Manual S are safe methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to add additional " safety factors " when selecting air conditioning equipment . <p> Problems With Manufacturers ' Data . Air conditioners selected based on standard indoor conditions of 80 degrees F with 50% relative humidity ( which is the standard Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute capacity rating condition ) will be incorrectly sized for 75 degrees F. Unfortunately , many of the major manufacturers provide information only at 80 degrees F. It would be a great improvement if the manufacturers provided tables that presented the sensible and latent capacities at 75 degrees F for a variety of indoor humidities . Recommendations <p> There are contractors out there who would like to do the job right . When purchasing air conditioning equipment , you should : Not let the contractor size by square foot . Insist on a copy of the calculations ( or computer inputs and outputs )  --  even if you do n't understand them . Be willing to pay for the time the contractor must spend to do the job right . Do n't just take the lowest bid . <p> You should also make sure the contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consistency . Use design outdoor conditions and daily temperature range exactly for your location per Manual J or ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals . If not listed , use the data for the closest location with a similar climate . Use standard 75 degrees F design indoor temperature . Consider both location and level of insulation of ducts . Consider R-value and type of roofs , floors , and walls to assess cooling factors . Partitions and knee walls that separate a conditioned space from an unconditioned space such as an attic or garage should be treated separately from the exterior sunlit surfaces . Pay attention to window type , material , and interior shading . An error in this area can throw off the window heat gain by as much as 100% . Account for the effect of overhang shading . Consider window height , overhang length , and distance to the tip of the window as shown on page 30 of Manual J. Calculate infiltration rate depending on air tightness of the building based on blower door measurements . Also , measure duct leakage and suggest any repair before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the number of people and the outdoor air humidity ratio . Do not use a " typical " multiplier . Consider ventilation load if appropriate . Select equipment based on the detailed manufacturer 's performance data . Do not rely on the nominal tonnage because the capacity of different air conditioner units may differ by more than 10% . Choose equipment based on the ACCA Manual S without using any safety factors . For dry climates , Manual S alone oversizes by approximately 20% compared to Manual J load . Properly evacuate the coil and refrigerant lines before releasing the refrigerant charge from the outside unit into the system . ( Use a micron gauge . ) After installation , check the air flow across the coil and the refrigerant charge using the manufacturer 's suggested methods . Air Conditioning Terms You Should Know <p> Sensible Cooling Load  --  The heat gain of the home due to conduction , solar radiation , infiltration , appliances , people , and pets . <p> Latent Cooling Load  --  The moisture added to the inside air by plants , people , cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design Conditions  --  Cooling loads vary with inside and outside conditions . A set of conditions specific to the local climate is necessary to calculate the expected cooling load for a home . Outside conditions are selected for the 2.5% design point . Inside conditions of 75degrees F and 50% relative humidity are usually recommended as a guideline . <p> 2.5% Design  --  Outside summer temperatures and coincident air moisture content that will be exceeded only 2.5% of the hours from June to September . In other words , 2.5% design conditions are outdoor temperatures historically exceeded 73 of the 2,928 hours in these summer months . <p> Capacity  --  The capacity of an air conditioner is measured by the amount of cooling it can do when running continuously . The total capacity is the sum of the latent capacity ( ability to remove moisture from the air ) and sensible capacity ( ability to reduce the air temperature ) . Each of these capacities is rated in Btus per hour ( Btu/hr ) . The capacity depends on the outside and inside conditions . As it gets hotter outside ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a standard set of conditions is often referred to as " tons of cooling . " <p> Tons of Cooling  --  Each ton of air conditioning is nominally 12,000 Btu/hr ( this comes from the fact that it takes 12,000 Btu to melt a ton of ice ) . While an air conditioner may be called a three ton unit , it may not produce 36,000 Btu/hr of cooling . There is a wide variety of actual capacities that are called " three tons . " <p> EER  --  The energy efficiency ratio is an air conditioner 's capacity in Btus divided by the electrical input in watts . EER changes with the inside and outside conditions , falling as the temperature difference between inside and outside gets larger . <p> By John Proctor , Zinoviy Katsnelson , and Brad Wilson <p> <p> Mr. Proctor and Mr. Katsnelson are president and senior research engineer with Proctor Engineering Group in San Rafael , Calif .
