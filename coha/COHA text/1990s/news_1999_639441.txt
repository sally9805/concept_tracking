<p> Be prepared ! <p> Thank you , New Century Energies , for the hour-long power failure this evening . It tested my household Y2K compliance . <p> I passed with flying colors . I wish I had more confidence in you . <p> ED LIPPERT <p> Arvada <p> No single solution <p> Re : ' Is excessive growth inevitable ? ' , Dec. 12 Al Knight column . <p> I applaud Mr. Knight 's willingness to tackle the difficult subject of immigration in relation to growth and sprawl . But immigration is only the tip of the iceberg . Even a complete ban on immigration will not solve the problems created by increasing human populations . Discussions on smart , sustainable growth must include other difficult issues . We must begin to talk about iron-clad development boundaries , mandatory water conservation , and not just preservation but the reclamation of open space . If we are not willing to limit our population , then we are going to have to talk about allowing fewer and smaller single-family homes and encouraging more people to live in apartment complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highways did I see a discussion of ways to eliminate cars from the highway . More lanes will lead to more cars and still-crowded highways . Public transport may be a long-term solution but those old , simple ideas of carpooling , telecommuting and living close to where you work were never discussed . What if government offered sizable tax incentives to promote these ideas ? Would cold , hard cash overcome the inconvenience factor ? <p> Few civic leaders want to bring up these ideas . No one wants to face the tough decisions necessary to implement them . But if we do n't , excessive growth is inevitable , along with an ever-dwindling quality of life . <p> DEBORAH A. ROSS <p> Colorado Springs <p> Easy as ABC <p> An item in The Denver Post ( ' Early alphabet evidence found , ' Nov. 14 ) casts an interesting light on the debate between phonics and sight , or ' whole word , ' methods of teaching students to read . <p> The alphabet is described as ' an invention by workaday people that simplified and democratized writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ( A ) lphabetic writing was revolutionary ( It ) emerged as a kind of shorthand by which fewer than 30 symbols , each one representing a single sound , could be combined to form words for a wide variety of ideas and things . This eventually replaced writing systems such as Egyptian hieroglyphics in which hundreds of pictographs , or idea pictures , had to be mastered . ' <p> The invention of the alphabet introduced phonetic writing , eliminating the need to memorize hundreds of formal symbols , so everyone could read and write . The teaching of reading and writing through phonics today eliminates the need to memorize hundreds or thousands of printed ' whole word ' symbols and makes it possible for everyone to learn to read and write . <p> D. MUELLER <p> Golden <p> Y2K : THE FINAL WORD <p> A double excuse <p> I pushed ' the millennium begins on Jan. 1 , 2001 , not Jan. 1 , 2000 , ' several years ago , until I remembered that the Gregorian calendar we now use was introduced in 1582 and the Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , the ' turn of the millennium ' is just as arbitrary a date as any . <p> All four digits changing at once is arguably exciting , yet we could choose to be more excited on Jan. 1 , 2001 , when exactly 2,000 years have passed since the year 1 began , had the people of the time been using our system , which they were n't . Our calendar is arbitrary . If people want to celebrate the turning of the numerals , that is fine , I hope they have a good time . Those who are discomfitted by this should have no fear . I am confident that in a few months most entertainment businesses will be promoting Jan. 1 , 2001 , as the real beginning of the new millennium . Make your reservations now . <p> And for those who recognize that the whole thing is arbitrary anyway , why not party hard both years ? <p> DAVID THEIL <p> Denver <p> Think globally <p> The 20th century has been the most violent in human history . More people have died in wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close , many of us will be out celebrating a new millennium , making our resolutions and looking forward to a new start . We now live in an increasingly global world , and as technology brings us closer and closer together , it is time for each of us to make a resolution in regard to our global community . <p> A recent Harris poll demonstrates that American citizens want the U.S. to play a leading role in preventing and responding to humanitarian crises through a cooperative international effort . Furthermore , another recent poll by the University of Maryland found that 73 percent agreed ( 44 percent strongly ) with the statement , ' I regard myself as a citizen of the world as well as a citizen of the United States . ' <p> However , our representatives do not recognize this public opinion . Our Congress owes more than a billion dollars to the United Nations , it has rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , it refuses to even consider the Women 's Rights Treaty , and it has slashed aid to other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let our representatives know we want a strengthened U.N . It is time to make a New Year 's resolution by working towards real global stability for the good of all humanity . <p> LAURA McGAUGHEY <p> Denver <p> Act locally <p> With all the hype and apprehension as we face a new millennium , may I suggest that rather than fear the year 2000 , we make Y2K stand for a return to good manners and responsibility as citizens and neighbors . Holding a door for someone - regardless of their sex or age ; saying ' excuse me , ' ' I 'm sorry , ' ' thank you ' ; RSVPing to an invitation ; following through on promises ; letting people into a line of traffic ; shoveling a neighbor 's walk without being asked or compensated just basic consideration for others . Many of us learned these lessons as young people , some have yet to learn , but let 's make Y2K stand for yes to kindness ! <p> CHERYL BRUNGARDT <p> Wheat Ridge <p> Just how far do we want the Flats cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some statements we believe are incorrect in Mr. Joe Goldfield 's letter of Dec. 19 . <p> First , the current cleanup standard for plutonium in the Rocky Flats Buffer Zone is approximately 651 picocuries per gram of soil , a figure less than half the one Mr. Goldfield quotes . <p> Second , the study Mr. Goldfield cites that recommends 10 picocuries per gram reaches this conclusion only by assuming that Rocky Flats will in the future be used by a resident rancher , who will reside on the Rocky Flats Environmental Site 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and continue to live and ranch on the site after a spontaneous brush fire denudes the entire of vegetation for a full year . The projected land use of Rocky Flats after closure is open space . <p> Third , the same report cited by Mr. Goldfield confirms that the cleanup levels set by the DOE and its regulators in 1996 for the more likely future use options of open space and light industrial use are sufficiently protective . <p> Fourth , the scientific that initially recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently that it may have to amend this recommendation in light of peer review and further consideration by the authors . <p> It 's easy to play numbers games and take cheap shots at DOE . The communities that have been working on the cleanup of Rocky Flats for years are sophisticated and pragmatic enough to delve into the real issues facing the cleanup without demagoguery and misinformation . The community , DOE , and the regulators need to confront the real issues . Does the community want to divert scarce cleanup dollars to clean up prime open space to make it safe enough for one resident rancher ? What are the ecological impacts of such a cleanup on sensitive habitats ? How much additional nuclear waste will be created ? What are the risks to the workers and to the community of excavating so many acres of soil ? If the ' crown jewel ' of Front Range open space is cleaned to be safe for residential use , will the developers be far behind ? <p> JEREMY KARPATKIN <p> Rocky Flats Field Office <p> Department of Energy <p> Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Lighten up , drivers , ' Nov. 29 . I found it interesting and very true . I 'm only in eighth grade and ca n't drive yet , but I 've been with people who get upset if other people do something they do n't like on the road . If everyone would relax there would n't be as many accidents , especially around the holidays . I hope people who read this take the advice to ' chill out ' and drive safely . <p> STEPHANIE STEPHENS <p> Longmont <p> Relaxation therapy <p> If people just took the time and did n't get so stressed over the holidays , then there probably would n't be so much road rage and not as many accidents . I think you should list the relaxation strategies so people could try them . You are right that it 's not worth dying for . <p> ALISA WERTH <p> Longmont <p> The writers attend St. John the Baptist Catholic School in Longmont . MULTIPLE-GUN PURCHASES <p> head Objectivity forsaken <p> Re : ' The gun pipeline , ' Dec. 19 news story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 editorial . <p> I would like to congratulate The Denver Post for once again demonstrating the courage to abandon any pretense of objectivity in order to use your so-called ' news ' pages to promote the political agenda advocated in your editorial . <p> According to data in the Dec. 19 page-one story ' The Gun Pipeline , ' 4,000 guns were sold in multiple purchases in 1997 in Colorado . This means about 12,000 guns sold in multiple purchases over three years . The Post 's reporters found 96 handguns from multiple sale purchases were traced to crime in Colorado during 1995-1997 . <p> The spin could easily have been that 99.2 percent ( 11,904 of 12,000 ) of guns purchased in multiple sales are n't involved in crime . However , that would not have supported the position in the editorial , which advocated limiting the rights of those who can pass a Brady background check to buying one gun a month . Supporting the misguided editorial position is , of course , the purpose of the ' news ' pages . <p> It is also interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of zealously anti-gun ( then ) Rep. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , conducted a study on gun trafficking in 1996 . At the time , South Carolina and Virginia had ' one-gun-a-month ' laws . South Carolina was the No. 3 source for ' guns used in out-of-state crimes , ' while Virginia was fifth . <p> As long as firearms are a legal commodity , the idea of rationing their purchase by citizens - who already have to pass a background check - is as offensive and repressive as , say , allowing movie studios to release only one violent movie per month . Or legislating the number of times per year a rag like The Post can use its news pages to advocate legislation . Considering that The Post does n't charge the gun control lobby and anti-gun politicians for printing their propaganda , the latter suggestion could certainly be considered a reasonable method of campaign finance reform . <p> ROBERT RACANSKY <p> Westminster <p> Collectors no threat <p> As a gun collector , I have to respond to your recent editorial about gun control . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearm or even a pump shotgun . I am interested in historical arms from a collector 's perspective and as a competitive target shooter . I have restored Civil War-era firearms , participated in Civil War reenactments , marched in Fourth of July parades in costume with my muskets . I particularly enjoy the challenge of competitive target shooting with firearms that date from 1840 to 1890 . In 20 years of such activities , I have not had personal contact with anyone who has committed a crime with such firearms . <p> Consequently , I fail to understand how collecting such firearms represents a threat to public safety . Can you imagine Harris and Klebold trying to do what they did with a muzzle-loading firearm ? As a collector , I may want to buy all or part of someone 's collection . Laws that limit the number of collectable firearms purchased per month would severely hamper the efforts of legitimate collectors like myself while offering minimal benefit to the public . The paperwork of registration of historic arms also seems to be overkill . The issues are what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about background checks at gun shows . <p> So while you call for ' tougher laws , ' please carefully focus on what the problem really is and address legislation specifically . Unless you do , law-abiding citizens such as myself will have our rights taken away needlessly or end up bearing an unfair share of the burden and our society will end up with control and enforcement systems that cost too much . <p> ROY L. SANFORD <p> Highlands Ranch <p> Multicar purchase ? <p> After reading ' The gun pipeline , ' I am left hoping some follow-up work will answer these questions : Did Montago Ross own the car he was driving when in the hit-and-run accident ? Did he have a driver 's license and current insurance ? If not , how did he obtain the car ? Multiple purchase ? Same pawnshop ? <p> Was he , as a convicted felon , actually charged with possession of a firearm ? What penalty does that carry ? What sentence did he receive ? What was his prior record ? What crime was he out on ' intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail for a long time and keep them there ? <p> JEFF DAVIS <p> Montrose <p> Owens the heretic ? <p> Mark Obmascik 's Dec. 19 report , ' State boards getting white , ' was an alarming piece of journalism . First we are told that Gov . Owens has dismissed women and minority staff from state posts , people held over from the previous Romer administration . Heretic ! <p> We are told that Owens appoints people on the basis of merit and experience rather than color or gender . A sinister plot ! Then we learn that fewer women and minorities voted for , or support , the Owens administration ; hence , fewer have applied . Shocking ! <p> Then we are told that Gov . Owens has exercised his prerogative of appointing people who support him at the expense of people who do n't . How insolent ! <p> Finally , we learn that Owens ' paid-staff appointments mirror the current gender and minority numbers in the Colorado population . Storm the Bastille ! <p> For a newspaper that makes trashing Republicans a blood sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sterling <p> Economy misleads <p> Re : ' Best of times proves to be worst of times for charities , ' Dec. 12 . <p> It is too easy to be lulled into thinking that the high tide of prosperity is raising everyone 's boat . A low unemployment rate and decreasing welfare rolls do not necessarily signal that prosperity has trickled down to the economic underclass . Poverty has many faces , several of which are shadowed from the glow of good economic times . Consider the mother with children , choosing single parenting over living with an abusive husband . Or the Vietnam veteran , struggling to hold a steady job while chasing away the ghosts of war . Or a retired couple , their joy of surviving a medical hardship crushed by inadequate medical insurance . This is why organizations such as the Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation are particularly vigilant during these times . While many Coloradans find themselves floating in abundance , others occasionally slip below the surface . The ultimate measure of an economy , or more accurately a society , is not the unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for everyone . <p> JEFF ACKERMAN <p> Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation <p> Denver <p> Missing landmark <p> Re : ' A century of the arts , ' Dec. 19 . <p> Although your effort to recap highlights in the arts of Colorado was ambitious , there were a few factual errors , some glaring omissions and a bit of revisionist history . <p> For instance , Planet Bluegrass did not create the Telluride Bluegrass Festival . The visionary who started the wonderful event was Fred Shellman , who I had the pleasure to work with and who deserves credit for the years of work and devotion to music that have resulted in the joy of so many people over many years . <p> Colorado also gave birth to one of the most famous and beloved bluegrass bands , gone but not forgotten , Hot Rize . <p> Lastly , the history of the performing arts in Colorado is incomplete without a mention of the Colorado Chautauqua in Boulder . The place was built at the turn of the last century as an outpost for the arts in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chautauqua is the original American summer festival ! The Boulder Chautauqua is one of nine remaining Chautauquas in the country .
