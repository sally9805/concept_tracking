Eating out with kids does n't have to be a dining disaster Willie , with straws inserted into each nostril , is pretending to be a walrus . His baby sister is flinging cottage cheese from her high chair , carpeting the floor in a soggy white mess ... Is this what eating out is supposed to be like ? " I 'm scared to even try it , " admits Jill Teixeira , a Toronto mom who gasps at the thought of taking 18 - month - old David to a real restaurant . " I could n't enjoy myself . I would be so worried that he would throw something , or that I would have to leave right in the middle of the meal , or that one of us would end up holding him throughout the entire dinner . " A restaurant outing pries kids away from their home turf and can require unnatural behaviour  --  sitting still for long periods , eating unfamiliar food . But it can also be an opportunity for families to spend time together without distractions . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't focus on the conversation , " says Tessa Whitney of Lucan , Ontario . " You 're always hopping up when the phone rings or when someone needs more juice . In a restaurant you have the time to sit with the kids and talk . I always enjoy it . " Food for Thought For those first forays into dining out , it 's important to choose restaurants that welcome children . Family - oriented chains can be great training grounds for easing the transition from fast - food lineups to sit - down dining  --  they offer child - sized portions , crayons and placemats for colouring and a fun atmosphere . They 're also more likely to turn a blind eye to Willie the walrus . You may want to do a scouting trip or ask experienced parents where they enjoy taking young children . Although many restaurants offer such kid - pleasing food as burgers or spaghetti , they vary widely in poshness and attitude . Whatever the menu , check out ahead of time whether a restaurant is the crystal - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the - grape - juice - spills - on - the - disposable - tablecloth sort . Look for restaurants with diversions that will hold children 's attention  --  an interesting aquarium or lobster tank can be a lifesaver during a long wait . Holly Lee , a Toronto mother of two girls , says that many Chinese restaurants in her community are accustomed to accommodating families . She and her husband , Ben , never leave their kids at home when they head for Saturday morning dim sum or a family celebration at a Chinese buffet . " The first question the relatives would ask would be , " Where are the kids ? ' ' " she says . " It would be strange not to have them there . " During a recent outing with her baby and a slew of relatives , the waiters even offered to set up a private corner for nursing . Experienced parents beat the rush hour and opt for an unfashionably early dinnertime . Restaurants are less crowded then , and the service is quicker . When embarrassing moments strike  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This is yucky ! "  --  the audience is small . The other bonus is that the food arrives before the kids are really hungry . " A big mistake is to wait until the regular eating time to go to the restaurant , " says Toronto dad Gary Fearnall . " By the time the food comes it 's 45 minutes later , and you 've lost them . " What 's on the Menu ? Pizza ! " suggests Calgary restaurant critic John Gilchrist , who for years has been taste - testing with his niece and five nephews . " Even older kids and adults enjoy eating with their hands , " he says . An added bonus : " The fewer things there are on the table , the fewer things can end up on the floor . " Most kids also like pasta eateries , delicatessens , and soup - and - sandwich bars . Many parents swear by the buffet , where food can be on the plate in less than 30 seconds and kids can sample new items without committing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of foods  --  shrimp chips , veggies , snacking things , rice  --  and keep on eating , " says Lee . Nancy Wyonch of Port Elgin , Ontario , agrees . Her six - year - old , Rosalie , loves buffets . " She loves picking out what she 's going to eat , even if it 's a whole plate of chicken wings . " Do n't Forget the Kitchen Sink It may not always be necessary to pack toys , books , paper , washable markers , and a wet washcloth for sticky fingers , but it pays to be prepared . Lee even takes a packet of baby cereal along , and she keeps a blanket and pillows in the car so she can nurse in comfort if necessary . It may seem strange to bring along a snack , but as Fearnall says of his three - year - old twins , " I find if they get too tired or too hungry , they wo n't eat at all . " If you anticipate that your meals will take a while to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackers as she is seating you . Very young children often benefit from having a few of the comforts of home brought along . Sheila Brascoupe of Ottawa used to pack her daughters ' familiar baby - sized utensils . " The knives and forks were always too big , and with a beaker cup you do n't have to worry about tall glasses tipping over , " she says . And most importantly , " BYOB  --  Bring Your Own Bib , " she laughs . Brief the Troops Beforehand If you 've never braved a fancy restaurant , it might be a good idea to discuss it beforehand with your children so they know what to expect . If you 've tried role playing with your kids , a mock restaurant meal at home  --  with candles and special place settings  --  may encourage eating without antics . As one Calgary mom says from experience , " If you allow goofing off , the whole thing degenerates very quickly . " When my own children were younger , we had a code of " restaurant behaviour " that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered . If all three suddenly started screeching for the ketchup , I would settle them down by saying , " I thought you put your restaurant behaviour on . " Plan an Escape Route If it 's not working , take a time - out . When our second son was nearly two , he would be fine until the food arrived . Then he would erupt into tears . Perhaps the fries were the wrong shape or the sauce the wrong colour  --  we never did find out . But we always had an escape plan ready so that we could remove him , calm him down and dry his tears . Sometimes , all a child needs is a walk around the parking lot . Then head back inside and try again . How to Survive the Waiting Game Probably the most trying thing about eating out with kids is the long wait before the food arrives . Here are a few suggestions to make the time pass quickly : Prepare age - appropriate goody bags packed with crayons , small toys , Lego or a deck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Placemats covered in local business ads are great for asking , " Where can we buy a book ? Fix our car ? " Play with what 's available . Cloth napkins are a good diversion when turned into impromptu puppets held up with cutlery . Play I Spy , or the toddler version : " Where 's the clock ? Where 's the spoon ? " Read aloud or tell a story . Board books are good because spilled food can be easily wiped off . Have kids write down their food choices . That way , they can learn to spell some challenging words like " guacamole . " Figures not transcribed Consult original publication <p>
