<p> Each of us shares one experience with everyone on this earth - that of being a child . Most have also grown up in families , and as adults , become parents themselves . Our most powerful memories , our deepest feelings , are bound up in these relationships , and in our innermost thoughts of who we are , where we came from , and the ends and purposes of our lives . Rarely does a single event reach in and pluck all those chords at once . But the cloning of the sheep , Dolly , last year , with its implications for human cloning , reverberated around the world . There was instant recognition that more than scientific advances were involved . The potential of cloning a child poses deep religious and moral questions - for the child and society - as well as the prospect that technology may outstrip our ability to deal with those questions . Theologians and ethicists have been galvanized to enter the public debate on whether that step should be taken . This is " one of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of theology and culture at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield , Ill . " Its significance is enormous . As a Nobel laureate has said , it is on a par with the atomic bomb . " " The cloning of a human being represents a radical break with the human past and with the established patterns of human life , " says R. Albert Mohler Jr. , president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville , Ky . The cloning of 50 mice announced last month confirmed that developments are moving more quickly than anticipated . " Absolutely , we 're going to have cloning of humans , " enthused a prominent biologist . Religious thinkers do n't share that enthusiasm , but their perspectives do vary considerably , from calling for an international treaty banning cloning as a crime against humanity , to accepting cloning as a future human reproductive method , once it is procedurally safe and children could be adequately protected . <p> An ethical imperative ? For many , such a step is simply unacceptable . " Science is very exciting , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might call the technological imperative and say , ' Come on , if we can do it , let 's do it and see what happens , ' says Sir John Polkinghorne , a physicist turned Anglican priest . " But the technological imperative has to be tempered by the ethical imperative , saying , ' Is that something that should be done ? ' My view is that it is not . " Dr. Cameron , known for his work on medical ethics , says one reason this is so significant is that it will decide " whether we can control technology or whether technology will drive its own agenda . If on an issue like this , where the polls have been running 9 to 1 against , we can not say , ' We do not want to do this and we wo n't , ' then it 's hard to see any scenario in which the biosciences come up with options , and we 'll be able to decline . " Some see a troubling overreaching that fails to consider the limitations of human beings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humans are capable of determining their own destiny in a way that is a fundamental violation of our being as creatures , that is , beings whose existence is determined by an agency beyond our own , " says Joel Shuman , visiting lecturer in theology and ethics at Duke University Divinity School in Durham , N.C. For those who see human life as a cosmic accident or the result of a blind evolutionary process , says Dr. Mohler , it may seem right to try to be masters of our destiny . But from the Christian viewpoint , " We are not the Creator , and the responsibility to assume control of the universe is not ours . " <p> It 's not ' all in the genes ' The most fundamental issue is human dignity . Most theologians agree on three points . First , the scientific fact is that cloning does not entail creating an identical person - it is not " all in the genes " ( see box above ) . Identical twins are unique individuals , although they have the same genome . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God and be loved equally by God . Third , no human being should ever be treated as an instrument to an end ; individuals are ends in themselves . For many , that maxim precludes cloning , which they say entails using a child for one 's own purposes . For instance , medical ethics say experiments should only be performed on someone who has given " informed consent . " A cloned child would not be able to give consent . " Cloning is unacceptable because clones would be human beings created , at least in part , to fulfill the will of another human being , " says David Byers , director of the Committee on Science and Human Values of the United States Catholic Conference . To clone a child to achieve " immortality " or to " replace " a dying child is unethical . And early clones would be treated as freaks , Dr. Byers says in " Human Cloning : Religious Responses " ( Westminster John Knox Press ) . Ted Peters , professor of theology at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sees it differently . He sees " nothing sacred in DNA " and does n't accept that " it is better to have a child born the old-fashioned way , by accident so to speak , with the genetic code out of control of the parents . " It is almost inevitable that we will be gaining more control over the genetic makeup of our future children , " he says , " and we need an ethic that will keep pace . " His concern lies not with the procedure but with ensuring that children will be treated with love and their " human dignity be lifted up , " whatever their birth method . <p> Changing ties that bind Other theologians say that cloning would " represent a radical shift in the ties that bind us , " in Byers 's words , changing familial and societal relationships in unhealthy and unethical ways . They point to the psychological implications for a cloned child - the burden of being so different , of facing unusual parental expectations , of likely social discrimination . Others emphasize the dangers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer children , " of the prospect of a loving procreation experience turning into a factory model of human reproduction . Mohler worries about the reemergence of eugenics and its potential , already demonstrated historically , for serious missteps in attempting to improve humankind . Seyyed Hossein Nasr , professor of Islamic studies at George Washington University in Washington , D.C. , sees broad implications . " I believe this attempt at cloning is going to multiply the tremendous problems we already face . It 's amazing that we are on the verge of destroying the environment through modern technology , and do not want to talk about it , and now " we are ready to simply enter a new realm that could bring further unforeseen consequences . This step in " artificializing " life is also part of a pattern affecting society in deep ways , he suggests . " Modern technology keeps creating artificial ambiences in which God appears to be unreal . People who live in the world of nature are never atheists . It 's when man lives in an artificial ambience created by himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expanding this artificiality of ambience , first in expansion of cities , then artificializing nature , then with the computer creating a virtual reality . Now cloning takes the ultimate step in artificializing life . It will have a tremendous impact . The more people are enmeshed in an artificial ambience , the easier it is to forget God . " <p> Reasons for cloning Given the possible misuses and abuses , and the human responsibility for decisions that could bring unintended consequences , many religious thinkers say that before cloning is undertaken there must be some compelling reason to do so . Some scientists - including Ian Wilmut who cloned Dolly - do n't support human cloning . Those in favor see it as another method in the growing pantheon of human reproductive technologies . For theologians who take a positive view , its greatest benefit may be a solution for infertility . Jewish ethicists have said that , in principle , there is no theological reason not to clone . " The Jewish perspective ( Orthodox , Conservative , and Reformed agree ) is that cloning is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Rabbi Elliot Dorff , vice-chair of the Conservative movement 's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards and rector at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles . " The question is to what use do you put it . In regard to human cloning , some uses would be very bad and some would be very good . " For the Jewish community , " cloning could become an important way to overcome infertility , " he says , since about 30 percent of the Jewish population is infertile . He sees the downsides as people engaging in cloning for ego purposes ; the psychological issues facing cloned children ; and most of all , " What do you do with the ones that ' do n't work ? ' " " You do n't have a right to destroy any human being , " he adds , " and it may be that the benefits are not greater than the risks . " " While the theological issue of hubris is not an issue for us , " he says , there is a legitimate risk-benefit analysis society needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another reason often suggested is to allow parents with an ill child who may , for example , need a bone marrow transplant , to clone a child to serve as a donor . Some ethicists are sympathetic , while others say this is another example of using a child as an instrument to an end . " It would be legitimate to use the nuclear transplanting technique to produce bone marrow tissue , but not to produce a human being from which to extract tissue , " says Polkinghorne , author of " Belief in God in an Age of Science " ( Yale University Press ) and member of the United Kingdom 's Human Genetics Advisory Commission . <p> Is it inevitable ? Nancey Murphy of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena , Calif. , has suggested ethicists should concentrate on what to do with cloning instead of saying it should n't be done , because " it ca n't be prevented . " Dr. Peters feels it " probably " will happen because " the profit is going to be there , if the economy stays in good shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore supports a " public policy that would prohibit cloning for a specified period , say five years , to give our society a period of time to work through the values issues related to bringing children into the world in this exotic fashion . " Those with a less sanguine view see other reasons for caution . Western civilization keeps creating applications of new technologies that force religions from other cultures to respond quickly , says Dr. Nasr . Only in the past two to three years , he says , have thinkers in the Islamic world begun studying implications of genetic engineering and cloning . Nasr himself opposes cloning , while some Islamic scholars remain open to the idea . Cameron says this ultimately has to be an international decision . The reaction to Dolly was worldwide , and Europeans have been working on these issues for years , he says . Several European countries , including Britain and Germany , have already made human cloning illegal . The Council of Europe has amended its Bioethics Convention to outlaw it and states are signing on . China has even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roger Shinn , professor emeritus of social ethics at Union Theological Seminary in New York , draws the distinction between personal beliefs and public policy . In the pluralistic US society , before we can enact legislation such as a ban we need to reach some level of consensus . Those who feel there are strong moral arguments , he says , must make their case persuasive to the broad community . " I 'm a lot less optimistic than I was last year , " Cameron says , " when there was a prospect of a relatively rapid international consensus in which the US would be taking the lead . " The several cloning bills introduced in Congress appear stalled . " The bills have gotten locked into the pro-life/reproductive rights debate , and the biotech companies have also been lobbying hard . " " I do n't think we 're going to ban cloning in the States . It may take some clonings and some scare stories coming out of the experience to make us look at this again - like what happened in the thalidomide situation in @ @ @ @ @ @
