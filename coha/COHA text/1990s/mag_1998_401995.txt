But over time the pain got worse and the energy turned into extreme anxiety . I could n't sleep or concentrate and had to quit my job .

But her problem was n't all in her head , it was all in her neck . " It took the psychiatrist 10 minutes to conclude I was n't crazy and advise me to have my thyroid checked . " Kelly , like the roughly 10 million American women currently afflicted with thyroid disease , suffered form one of the most common-and most commonly misdiagnosed-ailments affliction women . A simple , widely available blood test revealed that she had Graces ' disease , a thyroid disorder common among women between the ages of 20 and 40 .

Roughly one in 20 before you turn 35 ; one in 10 by the time you 're 50 . But unlike Kelly , you do n't have to spend years postponing your life and suffering from unexplained pain . By being a little paranoid over your thyroid , you can nip thyroid problems before they drive you crazy . Slight of Gland Imagine a butterfly with its wings wrapped around a pole- that 's your thyroid wrapped around your windpipe just above the dip between your collarbones . The small gland releases a hormone that sets your body 's basic tempos-the rate of your pulse and metabolism and the speed at which nerve impulses pass hetween your brain and muscles . Blame the butterfly for your slower-than-desired metabolism or praise it for your ability to do without much sleep . What trips up this tiny timekeeper ? The culprit is our own immune system-gone haywire .

Here 's what can throw off your immune system : First , you have to be genetically predisposed to immune con fusion . Maybe your mom had another autoimmune problem such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , diabetes , or certain kinds of anemia . ( And it is usually your mom-for reasons experts ca n't explain , women are seven times more likely than men to suffer from thyroid trouble . ) Or maybe you 've gone gray before hitting your 30th birthday ( a sure indicator-although experts do n't know why-of susceptibility to autoimmune disorders ) . Then something throws your body out of whack ; a major illness , life stress , or a large hormonal swing , as can happen during pregnancy or when going on or off birth-control pills . Although doctors do n't understand how it works , these stressors can jolt your immune cells into a dire misfire .

Instead of aiming at invading viruses , your immune cells begin to go after your thyroid , altering the gland 's function in one of two possible ways . If the immune cells latch on to the thyroid cells responsible for stimulating the gland , they kick the thyroid into overdrive : You , like Kelly , can feel as though you 're on a very fast highway to hell . On the other hand , if the immune buffoons actually destroy the areas responsible for thyroid-revving , they can slow the land , leaving you tired , achy , and prone to weight gain . Pedal to the Metal Alyson Riley recalls when she had her first inkling that her body was undergoing an usual change : " At first , I felt better than normal-like I had lots of extra energy .

" recounts Al ) , son , whose jacked-up metabolism allowed her only three hours of sleep each night and made her constantly feel as though she 'd just had five cups of coffee . There are two treatments for an overactive thyroid . One involves tempering the land 's tempo with a drug like Tapazole . But drug treatment has to continue for life-a concept that Alyson just was not into . So she opted for a one-time treatment of radioactive iodine . " With iodine treatment , the patient simply swallows a drink containing the radioactive substance , which is then absorbed by the thyroid , " explains Lawrence Wood , M.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . The special iodine permanently destroys part of the gland , resulting in a slowing down of its function . But Dr. Wood continues to monitor Alyson 's thyroid hormone levels : " Usually a young woman whose thyroid is overactive will experience underactivity because of the radioiodine .

" After they ruled out drugs , I was diagnosed as having postpartum psychosis and sent to the Hestia Institute , which specializes in treating psychological conditions for women who 've recently had babies , " recalls Kabat . After three months , a nurse at Hestia felt the glands : It was swollen . Tests confirmed that Kabats thyroid was way out of whack ! " Although she had a particularly severe reaction , Kabat s case is typical of the way that pregnancy can trigger thyroid dysfunction , " says Dr. Wood .

" After my son was born , I started feeling so tired I sould hardly get through the day , " says Ann Marie Barry , 31 , a medical secretary in New York City . " When I complained in passing to the doctors I work with , they said that with a colicky baby at home and a full-time job , I had every right to be tried , " she recalls .

" The pituitaty gland at the base of brain releases TSH in reaction to low levels of thyroid hormone in the blood , " say Dr. Wood . So when the thyroid is overactive , TSH usually falls below the 0.4 microunits per milliliter of blood cutoff . And when the gland slows down , TSH spikes above the normal upper limit of 5 . " Your-best bet in any case is to have your TSH screened when you have your cholesterol checked-every 5 years after age 30 , " recommends Dr. Wood .

" I 'm a well-read , well-educated person , and when I had my postpartum freakout , I had no idea what was causing it , " says Kabat . " That 's why I agree with Dr. Wood that every woman should have follow-up thyroid tests right after delivery and again at the three-month mark .
