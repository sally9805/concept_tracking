<p> Vancouver , British Columbia - The best-known actress you 've never heard of , debuting tonight in the most-watched TV pilot you 've never seen , is seated inside a small but fully loaded trailer on the set of " Little Women " - a breakthrough film she shares with Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder . It does n't open until December . <p> " People say I 'm going to be famous when the show ' My So-Called Life ' comes on , " says Claire Danes , the 15-year-old nobody who nearly everybody in Hollywood is raving about , but whom few others will have seen before tonight 's 8 o'clock premiere on WSB/Channel 2 . ( See review on Page E/01 . ) <p> " I 'm not afraid - I mean , I am , a little , " she goes on . " But I ca n't get over people looking up to me . If I 'm going to be some ideal , that 's pretty grim . I mean , I know I 'm a good person . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so bizarre . You meet people like Winona Ryder and they 're just people , " she adds . " But then she 's worked with the most amazing people , and I do n't know how much to talk to her about it . I mean , I do n't want to ask her , ' Was Daniel Day-Lewis really cool ? ' Or say something like , ' I heard about Johnny Depp , Ryder 's ex-boyfriend - sorry . . . ' " <p> Danes - dressed in a white T-shirt and denim overalls before changing into 19th-century period costume for her " Little Women " role as Beth - speaks in the deliberate , oddly cadenced locutions that eerily mirror the voice-over that runs through her TV series . With throwaway lines like , " I can not bring myself to eat a well-balanced meal in front of my mother . It just means too much to her , " it 's a wryly observed narrative that most often has been compared to a ' 90s-style Holden Caulfield . <p> Danes ' looks in person are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chin protrudes a little there . But they transform weirdly when passed through a camera , developing a kind of soft-white iridescence that turns her into an unorthodox beauty . A photographer who snapped pictures of her on the set said of the experience , " The lens melts on her . " <p> Like many teens , she 's a kid and she 's not a kid . One minute Danes is outside her trailer in the breathtaking wilderness here , trading playful punches with her older brother , Asa , visiting from Oberlin College . <p> Next minute she 's standing on the outdoor set , a continent away from her New York City home , listening coolly to Gillian Armstrong , the Australian-born " Little Women " director who made the highly regarded film " My Brilliant Career . " <p> " In conversations with her on the set , I kept forgetting she was a kid , " says " Life 's " co-executive producer , Scott Winant , who directed tonight 's pilot , taped when Danes was 13 . " Then a cultural reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caught off guard . I 'd realize , ' She 's a 13-year-old girl ! ' <p> " Her look is fluid , " Winant adds . " You can look at her at times and she 's the teen that she is . And then you turn around and in the next moment she projects a calmness and stability that only comes from a much older person . It 's frightening . " <p> Her father , Chris Danes , sums up his daughter 's complexities with a shrug . " She 's 15 . " <p> The similarity between Danes ' TV character , Angela Chase , and the bright-but-confused teen who narrates " The Catcher in the Rye , " J.D. Salinger 's classic novel of youthful dislocation , is n't an accident . While Angela is a far more grounded character than Holden , her desperately casual groping for meaning and identity is so vital to " My So- Called Life " that its producers were willing to shelve the project if they could n't find somebody like Danes to portray her . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody the voice of this s how , and I think had we not found Claire , we probably would n't have proceeded , " says executive producer Ed Zwick , who , with Marshall Herskovitz and other " Life " executives , previously created the similarly styled baby-boomer drama " thirtysomething . " <p> " The ability to embody complex and contradictory emotions in a single moment is what defines great acting , " Zwick adds . " What Claire knows ca n't be taught . " <p> Though Danes has identified herself as an actress since she was 3 , she came to the role of Angela virtually out of nowhere . She is n't a prodigy in the all-consuming , childhood-be-damned sense . Nor is she the product of a stage-struck family pushing her toward the floodlights . <p> " We 're quite functional , " she says of her parents , who 've been married 26 years , and brother . " They 're one of the healthiest families I know . " <p> Danes did grow up in what Middle America might consider an unconventional environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was a construction contractor ; her mother , Carla , has been a textile designer and an early childhood teacher , holding classes in the family 's loft . <p> Danes attended public schools , collecting used crack vials she picked up in Washington Square Park on her way to day care . " Play dates " were arranged for her to meet friends ; dance and gymnastics classes were scheduled for her to leave the loft . She rarely just played . " I did classes , " she says . " In New York you do classes . <p> " When I was little , we went to my cousins ' in New Jersey and I got so jealous , " she adds . " Everything was planned and immaculate and pretty , and there were carpets . . . it was like it should be . <p> " Then we 'd come back to New York and I hated it : You ca n't go out by yourself , the subways smelled , you 'd have to hike up the stairs . You were exposed to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look back and you could n't catch me dead in New Jersey , " she says . " I 'm grateful we were n't sheltered . " <p> Her family says Danes was always a performer . But she was n't a ham . She wanted to be good more than she wanted to be noticed . She played a rabbit in a first-grade play , and her mother recalls Claire wagging her tail like crazy from a back row where she could barely be seen . <p> " She 's an intense character - since she was 3 she wanted to be a movie star , " says her brother , Asa . " She was low key , but with a great deal of seriousness . It was always about the acting . Acting as art . " <p> Danes always had a sophisticated sense of what she wanted , making distinction s between the art of acting and the schlock of art . She had off-off-Broadway roles . Attended New York 's Professional Performing Arts School , avoiding the TV commercials other kids flocked to . Took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 11 , she landed a role in a low-budget independent film with Milos Forman ( " Amadeus " ) as executive producer . Later she turned down a soap- opera role in " One Life to Live . " " I was afraid of being stylized , " she says . <p> Danes and her father then flew to Los Angeles ( " Her ' debutante ' thing , " he calls it ) for a parade of auditions . She got a few minor roles : " Law &; Order , " a Tyne Daly TV movie , a Dudley Moore sitcom that never aired . <p> Then the " My So-Called Life " producers began hunting for an Angela . While most TV teen roles are played by actors ranging in age from 18 to their 30s , Zwick and Herskovitz wanted an actress about Angela 's age of 15 . <p> Danes was one of the first who auditioned , and the producers knew they 'd found Angela . But Zwick ca n't pinpoint why . <p> " It was ineffable , " is the best he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The pilot , taped a year ago , is remarkable TV . It 's a self-contained short film on middle-American family life as profound as it is funny , as painful as it is honest . <p> Danes burns throughout like some glowing , controlled flame . In a final scene , she starts to sob as she apologizes to her mother , her face contorting with an ugly vulnerability that seems to have nothing to do with acting at all . <p> " She 's not afraid to be ugly - she thinks that 's the mark of a good actor , " Carla Danes explains . " She says when an actor starts worrying about her looks , that 's the end . " <p> Adds Winant , " She was n't performing in that scene . She was there . " <p> The pilot was so good that ABC brass did n't know what to do with it . They planned to premiere it last spring , but could n't decide on a time slot . Should it air early for teens ? Late for adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " allows ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert . " We could have put it on in the spring on Thursdays at 9 against NBC 's hit sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , but this is special . It did n't deserve that . " <p> Meanwhile , word of the pilot spread and cassettes were slipped into studio VCRs all over Los Angeles . <p> " The pilot became a remarkable underground phenomenon , " says Winant . " It was circulated like contraband . People were trading cassettes , executives would talk about it at meetings , those who had n't seen it would become upset . " <p> Its cult cachet elevated Danes ' stature in stark disproportion to her onscreen appearances . When Winant was up for the " Little Women " directing job , he touted Danes for a role in the adaptation of Louisa May Alcott 's children 's classic . Even when Winant lost out to Armstrong , Winona Ryder , who 'd seen the " My So-Called Life " pilot , lobbied for Danes . <p> Now Danes is in the peculiar position of waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been launched . She does n't know what to expect . <p> " It 's about to happen , and what happens with TV happens profoundly and quickly , " says Zwick . " It 's a legacy of everything that has come before this moment . The transition from ingenue to leading man or woman is the hardest transition in acting . It 's the legacy of the person more than the career - whether they become arrested psychologically , or continue to grow and change as people do at that age . " <p> Though Danes ' visibility is sure to rise after tonight , " My So- Called Life " is far from a sure hit . As with the producers ' " thirtysomething , " some critics wonder if the series is n't too real , too close to the bone , to hold a sizable audience . <p> " It 's tough , and people saying that is totally legitimate , " Winant admits . " TV should provide many things , and part of that is escapism . <p> " But a little reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience out there hungry for something more grounded , " he adds . " Maybe we should get a government grant . " <p> Danes and her parents have moved temporarily to Los Angeles . Her father is pursuing a new career in computers while her mother acts as a personal manager ; since Danes is n't yet 16 , a parent or guardian has to accompany her on the set . <p> Danes is determined to stick with her schoolwork , and plans to join a high school government organization . " I need something nerdy like that , " she says . <p> She has already had her dedication to this weird-for-a-kid career tested . She became exhausted while shooting the TV series and could n't work , closing production for three days . While shooting " Little Women " - whose dragged-out , feature-film pace often made her feel underused after TV 's bang-bang rhythms - she sat crying one day in her Vancouver trailer , ready to quit . She changed her mind after talking with Ryder , who also went through many of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say the word ' stop ' to this business , " she says . " That was a powerful thing . " <p> Now Danes is just taking things as they come . <p> " I do n't know how to go about this plotting a career thing , " she says . " I feel like I 've hopped on a horse , and it was at a trot , and now it 's cantering , and I 'm not holding onto the reins . <p> " But I 'm on for the ride , " she adds . " I mean , if I do n't get kicked off or anything . "
