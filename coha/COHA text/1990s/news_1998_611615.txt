<p> Russia is being challenged anew to disclose whether it is continuing a secret military research program on offensive biological weapons despite its earlier denials and an international treaty forbidding such work . <p> A defector to the United States who held high rank inside the Soviet-era biological warfare program , as well as activists here , have called in recent days for Russia to reveal whether it still maintains an illicit germ warfare complex . <p> Although President Boris Yeltsin renounced the biological weapons program in 1992 and Moscow had ratified an international treaty barring the development , production and storage of biological weapons , some Western intelligence experts have been concerned in recent years that Russian military and security agencies have nonetheless retained a research network that could be used to develop such weapons . <p> Their concerns have been reinforced by Russia 's refusal to permit international inspections of some closed military facilities , including one in Yekaterinburg , in the Ural Mountains east of Moscow , that was at the center of the world 's most serious known outbreak of human inhalation anthrax in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological weapons accident . <p> The latest call for disclosure came from Kanatjan Alibekov , who was second-in-command of a branch of the Soviet program from 1975 to 1991 and who defected in 1992 and wrote a history of the Soviet biological weapons program for the CIA . <p> He was the second leading Soviet participant in the program to defect to the West . In 1989 , Vladimir Pasechnik , who was director of a key institute in what is now St. Petersburg , defected to Britain and revealed the existence of the Soviet Union 's vast " Biopreparat " complex for biological weapons development . During the 1980s , it employed more than 25,000 people and included 18 research institutes , six mothballed production facilities and a large storage plant in Siberia . <p> In an interview published today by the New York Times , and in an interview to be aired tonight on the ABC News program " Prime Time Live , " Alibekov , who now goes by the name Ken Alibek , spoke out for the first time publicly , although his role in confirming aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Russia continues to study offensive biological weapons agents under the guise of defensive research . <p> " They continue to do research to develop new biological agents , " he was quoted as saying , " They conduct research and explain it as being for defensive purposes . " <p> " We can say Russia continues research in this area to maintain its military biological potential , " he said . " They keep safe their personnel , their scientific knowledge . And they still have a production capability . " <p> He said Moscow 's Cold War plans included preparing " hundreds of tons " of anthrax bacteria and tons of smallpox and plague viruses . <p> " I think his claims that Moscow had plans for producing large quantities of anthrax is credible , " said Jonathan B. Tucker , director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Project at the Center For Non-Proliferation Studies in Monterey , Calif . <p> Tucker has written , for example , that the Progress Plant in Stepnogorsk , in what is now Kazakhstan , was built in the early 1980s for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be brought on line with six-months notice . Buildings there were designed to produce , process , handle and store biological agents as well as turn them into weapons . By 1987 , according to Tucker , the Soviet Biopreparat complex could produce a little more than 96 pounds of freeze-dried plague bacteria per week , if ordered to do so . <p> " Stepnogorsk had enormous production capacity , " Tucker said in an interview today . " It was not engaged in large-scale production . It was a mothballed facility that would be up and running in wartime in six months . The part I think is most credible is they did have substantial production capacity . It is unclear if they had large stockpiles . " <p> Tucker said the difficulty in establishing the truth about Russia 's current program is the ambiguity between research on defensive means , such as a vaccine , and on offensive weapons , which often involve identical equipment . <p> " Defense is very difficult to distinguish from offensive , " he said . " If you are developing a defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent . " Even small quantities of these organisms could be grown to military significant quantities " in a few weeks , " he said . <p> In September 1992 , after Alibek defected and took his information to the CIA , the United States , Britain and Russia signed an agreement specifying a program to build confidence that Russia was in fact dismantling its biological weapons program . <p> At the time , Russia acknowledged that the program had been a closely guarded Soviet secret but denied that biological weapons were being stockpiled . <p> According to Tucker , Russia agreed to terminate all offensive biological weapons research , dismantle pilot production lines , close testing facilities , cut personnel involved in military biological programs by 50 percent and reduce funding by 30 percent . The agreement also called for short-notice inspection of " any non military biological site " suspected of being involved in the biological weapons program . <p> But over the last few years , Western officials have repeatedly complained about foot-dragging by Russian officials , and the trilateral process has stalled as Russia has refused requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the debate centers on a top-secret installation in Yekaterinburg , which was named Sverdlovsk in Soviet times . In April 1979 , the military microbiology laboratory there known as Compound 19 emitted a cloud of anthrax spores that spread downwind into another closed area known as Compound 32 . <p> Officially , 68 people died after inhaling the anthrax , which was blamed on an outbreak among livestock and the spread of contaminated food . Yeltsin , who had been Communist Party boss of Sverdlovsk , later acknowledged that the military had been responsible for the leak . <p> But the KBG conducted a furious campaign to cover up the cause and eradicate the evidence , and since then a debate has been underway about the affair as well as the current research at the heavily guarded facility . <p> In 1994 , a Western research group that included Professor Matthew Meselson of Harvard University published a study , based on research at the scene , that confirmed that the anthrax came from the secret military installation . But their research left some questions unanswered , including the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a news conference in Moscow last week , and in a series of newspaper articles , Union for Chemical Study president Lev Fedorov , who had long been concerned about chemical weapons , charged that the 1979 leak did not release anthrax but some kind of " new biological weapon " that was designed to target middle-aged men . He did not provide fresh evidence for his claims about the new weapon but demanded that the Russian government disclose the full nature of activity there . <p> Fedorov was accompanied by Sergei Volkov , a former Yekaterinburg city official who grew up inside Compound 32 and whose father was a top security official there . Volkov , a self-styled environmental " dissident , " has spent years privately collecting data about the 1979 accident . In an interview , Volkov described the secret facility as a " super-modern " underground laboratory " where biological weapons were developed . " He maintains that the 1979 death toll was much higher than acknowledged . <p> Recently , scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who analyzed tissues preserved from accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthrax , leading to speculation that the germs were somehow enhanced to make vaccines less effective . <p> Time magazine this month published an interview with the former director of personnel at Compound 19 , who said the center has been discreetly rebuilding with the aim of resuming the production of offensive biological weapons . <p> Meselson , the professor , said he believes Russia should be more open . " We need to have some frank talk , " he said . " What did they do there , and what are they doing now ? "
