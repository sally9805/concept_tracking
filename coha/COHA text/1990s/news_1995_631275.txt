<p> It 's halftime , Fort Lewis College is getting killed , and no one in the locker room can figure out why the coach is carrying an enormous jar of pinto beans . <p> Without explanation , Gary Barnett drops a walnut into the bottom of the container and begins speaking to his beaten players about rising from adversity . He begins shaking the jar vigorously  --  and when his message is over , he sets the container down . <p> The walnut now rests on top of all those pinto beans . <p> " A great , great motivator , " said Jim Etzler , a defensive lineman who played for Barnett at Fort Lewis . " He just has the way to make you perform . " <p> Barnett then picked up the jar and smashed it against the back wall . His players stormed out of the locker room . <p> " We came back and won that day , you know , " Etzler said . <p> It is Monday afternoon in Evanston , and it 's clear one of the longest-running jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  once the very symbol of futility  --  is ranked 14th in the nation by the Associated Press , 17th in the coaches ' poll , and Barnett is inundated with requests . <p> He is the architect of the improbable , and following road victories against Notre Dame and Michigan , he is in the midst of what could be one of the best coaching jobs in history . <p> It appears he is doing what no one could accomplish in the past 35 years : Build Northwestern into a football power . <p> " People do n't think you can change things , " Barnett said . " People just do n't believe you can go about things the right way and get things changed . No one wants change , no one accepts change , so it 's hard for them to believe it . But if you look over history , it happens all the time . " <p> But at Northwestern , where the chemistry lab is deemed as important as the football team ? <p> What gives ? Have the stringent academic requirements loosened just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely not , " Northwestern president Henry S. Bienen said . " In all respects , he understands the values of Northwestern , and he 's never interested in bending those values . He wants to have a strong football program within those parameters . " <p> But how is Barnett succeeding where everyone from Rick Venturi to Dennis Green to Francis Peay failed ? <p> " I ca n't answer that , " Bienen said . " But I 'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth . " <p> Indeed , Bienen is so happy he has agreed to spend $ 20 million to further level the playing field . Of that money , $ 17 million will go toward renovation for Dyche Stadium , $ 3 million to construction of an indoor athletic facility . The groundbreaking is scheduled in May . <p> So , who is the man behind the curtain , the one pushing all the right buttons and concocting this fairy tale that could finish with a berth in a major bowl in just his fourth year at the helm ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , " Wildcats quarterback Steve Schnur said . <p> Indeed , when Barnett recruited Schnur  --  a star quarterback from St. Louis  --  the coach 's lofty goals almost seemed absurd given his school 's enigmatic past . <p> " It 's hard to talk to coach Barnett about Northwestern football without coming away thinking one of two things , " Schnur said . " Either the guy is completely crazy , or he 's pretty darned determined . I chose No. 2 , and that 's why I 'm here . " <p> Make no mistake , Barnett 's plan is rock solid . It starts with an emphasis on nationwide recruiting , thereby finding enough talented players to fit within Northwestern 's admission requirements ( next year 's list of 1,200 recruits has been pared to 300 ) . Next come enhanced facilities Barnett has deemed necessary , and they should spur the efforts . <p> " We 've been very aggressive , " Barnett said . " Our line has been that whoever comes in here and turns this thing around will be the guys who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an established program , you 're just another guy . <p> " And every kid who can get into this school knows they should come here . But they ca n't pull the trigger because they want the experience that a Michigan can give them . . . they want the thrills , the highs , the bowl games , the watches , the mementos you eventually throw away . So they have to trust that they can win here . " <p> Now they can . <p> The mindset finally has been changed . <p> " One of the biggest things he preaches is the power of the human mind , " Schnur said . " He gave us the story this year of how , under hypnosis , they can tell you a tape recorder weighs 300 pounds . When you wake up , they tell you to pick up the tape recorder , and you ca n't . So when you start buying into things like that . . . . " <p> Down go Notre Dame and Michigan . <p> " Right , " Schnur said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when you believe , it can be a powerful thing . " <p> Barnett , 49 , never believed he would become one of the hottest commodities in coaching . <p> A star quarterback in high school , he played under Dan Devine at Missouri . He spent two years as a graduate assistant at Missouri and two years as offensive coordinator at Air Academy High School in Colorado Springs , Colo . <p> Barnett became head coach at Air Academy in 1973 , and he compiled a 69-23 record in nine years . <p> Not exactly on the fast track . <p> " I 've always been real happy to be where I was at the time , " he said . " I never thought about the next step . " <p> For Barnett , that came in 1982 , when he was about to make a lateral move and coach Rampart High School in Colorado Springs . But the job at Fort Lewis College in Durango , Colo. opened up , and Barnett was the man . <p> Fort Lewis , a Division II school , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he changed the team 's attitude  --  and after he left , the Skyhawks won their conference championship . <p> " With the players that Gary recruited , " Etzler said . " He took a mediocre football program and turned it around . He was able to take players who were n't exactly super athletes , and make them play like they were . He left , and the other coaches who came in rode the foundation he had built . " <p> Perhaps the most influential day in Barnett 's life came when he was hired in 1984 as running backs coach for Colorado University . He worked under Bill McCartney for eight years and witnessed the rise of a dormant program . <p> In 1984 , Colorado finished 1-10 . Six years later , the Buffaloes won a national championship . <p> " We were 1-10 , you could n't find a Colorado T-shirt anywhere , and students bitched that they had to pay to get into the games , " Barnett said . " We played Nebraska at home , and the stands were 75 percent red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell their tickets . " <p> McCartney since has left Colorado , embarking on an evangelical mission called " Promise Keepers . " But his impact on Barnett is undeniable . <p> " I think Gary saw a side of college athletics from ( McCartney ) that he had never seen before , " said Louisiana State coach Gerry DiNardo , an assistant with Barnett at Colorado . " Things like there are certain ways to act during a pregame meal , ways to act on a road trip , that there is something to hard work , that there are more important things than talent , that a team like Northwestern can go to the Rose Bowl . <p> " Gary was exposed to all the old principles that are n't so popular today . And he got exposed to them through ( McCartney ) , who got them through ( former Michigan coach Bo ) Schembechler . " <p> But the confidence that anything is possible , the belief that most obstacles are self-imposed , all belong to Barnett . Though he refuses to look ahead given the Wildcats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would secure NU 's first bowl appearance since 1949 . <p> His record of 12-25-1 at Northwestern is nothing short of a miracle . And he is locked in for three more years . <p> " By my first set of expectations , I 'd say I was behind , " Barnett said . " I was totally naive to the Big 10 , totally naive to Northwestern . I did n't realize how much facilities became a major attraction to people in the Midwest , and how 21 years of losing had affected the people here in Chicago . <p> " If I based it on my second set of expectations , we may be a little bit ahead . " <p> Before Northwestern took the field Sept. 2 to play Notre Dame in South Bend , Barnett received a call from one of his top five recruits . The young man informed Barnett he would n't be attending Northwestern . <p> Moments after the Wildcats ' upset of the Fighting Irish , the phone rang again . <p> " He called one of our position coaches to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Sometimes you have to tell them , ' We 're Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , part of the Big 10 . ' " <p> Not anymore . <p> Three days ago , a man sat in a bar in Colorado , marveling at Northwestern 's upset of Michigan . He kept patting his wife on the shoulder , telling her , " That 's my coach , that 's my coach . " <p> " Am I surprised ? " Etzler said . " Absolutely not . ( Barnett ) just bulls ahead , thinking he 's going to win every game to the point where it 's contagious . <p> " And eventually , everyone believes it 's going to happen . "
