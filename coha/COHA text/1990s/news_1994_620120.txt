<p> Backhoes that gouged a 20- foot-deep pit in a quiet Benicia neighborhood this month have dug up more than just rusted tanks , an old vending machine and car parts . They have also revived deep-seated fears by residents that the ground beneath their homes is unsafe . <p> For more than three years , residents of Rose Drive and the cul-de-sacs that branch off it have been living a toxic nightmare , unsure whether their health is being threatened because their subdivision is built on top of an abandoned dump that they said they never knew existed . <p> Contractors hired by the developer , the Southampton Co. , and investigators from the state Department of Toxic Substances Control have found soil in back yards that is contaminated by chromium , lead , zinc and other heavy metals , tannery waste that may include carcinogens , and pesticide residues , including DDT . <p> Rusty metal from an old scrap heap worked its way to the surface of a hill behind one group of homes last summer . This month 's excavation work on Cambridge Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern that the buried tanks , which contain a petroleum product , could be polluting groundwater . <p> " We put all of our life savings into our house and now it 's worth zilch , " said Anna Hilde Smith , who bought her home just months before the contamination problems were discovered in June 1991 when a goo containing heavy metals was discovered in the back yard of a home on Rose Drive . <p> " I am fearful for myself and my safety , " Smith said . " You think about it morning , noon and night . You dream about it . We may not be gagged and bound , but we certainly feel like we are hostages . " <p> Tom Busfield , whose home at 876 Rose Drive sits atop the most contaminated area from the old Braito landfill , felt sick to his stomach as he watched backhoes uncover the debris on Cambridge Drive . <p> " What they 're digging up right now is the least offensive area , if there is such a thing , " he said one day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath my house is absolutely the worst . " <p> The Braito landfill was a general dump that accepted all kinds of waste , including industrial waste . It was closed in 1977 . <p> Busfield 's house  --  where toxic goo was first discovered in 1991 after the back yard began sinking  --  bears a sign reading " Hazardous Area , No Trespassing " posted by the California Environmental Protection Agency . Yellow tape with the word " caution " is tied around the trees , and the front gate , which is falling down from neglect , is chained and padlocked . <p> Busfield , his wife and their three children moved out the month after the horrifying discovery ; the house has since sat vacant . Southampton offered to buy it and six other homes in the most contaminated area . In addition , the developer said it would buy back as many as 60 other homes in the landfill 's so-called " footprint , " if the owners needed to move from the area . Busfield has refused to sell because he wants to retain control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 0 . <p> Fourteen residents have taken Southampton up on the buy-back offer , Southampton President Mike Olson said last week . Many residents who remain say they are unhappy with the slow pace of the investigation and with the lack of information about potential health hazards . <p> " There are no definitive answers , which is what is really frustrating , " Busfield said . His 17-year- old son , Josh , just had his thyroid gland removed because of hyperthyroidism and is losing his hair ; his wife suffers from anemia and has recurring headaches and the family worries that the vegetables and fruit that they ate from their contaminated back yard may cause long-term health problems . <p> Allan Hirsch , spokesman for the state Department of Toxic Substances Control , said his office considers the Rose Drive area " one of the high priority sites statewide . " The investigation is being handled through state headquarters rather than a regional office , as is the normal custom , because of the potential hazard to residents . <p> " We have not to date identified any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood right now , certainly nothing that would merit any type of evacuation , " Hirsch said . He said it may be impossible to determine health risks caused by past exposure to toxic substances . <p> Hirsch said he understands residents ' frustrations about the slow pace of the investigation , but he said that such work always takes a long time . <p> " It 's more the rule than the exception that investigations of these types take several years , " Hirsch said . " We 're dealing with the unknown . We 're trying to find out where hazardous materials may be located and how much and what kind of hazards they pose . Those are very complex questions that are not easily answered . " <p> Residents have blamed Southampton for the slow pace , saying the company is taking its time to avoid taking responsibility for the problems . Busfield 's garage is posted with a count of how many days  --  more than 1,240  --  it has been with " no resolution from Southampton . " <p> COMPANY 'S RESPONSE <p> Olson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes in Benicia over the past 23 years , wants to resolve the problem quickly but must comply with state orders and testing guidelines . <p> " We are also disturbed about the length of time , but as we understand it from consultants and other people in this business , we 've been moving at breakneck speed to try to get to the bottom of this , " Olson said . " We have never given any instructions to any consultants , lawyers , labs . . . to drag their feet . Our instructions have always been to do a quick turnaround . " <p> Olson said the investigation has cost Southampton nearly $ 4 million in testing and environmental field work alone . The company has been sued by about 80 residents and its legal bills are skyrocketing . And Southampton has not built a new house in 18 months , despite having 650 approved lots awaiting construction . <p> " We are trying to resolve the situation , " Olson said . " I do n't know how we can be more responsible . We 've hemorrhaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on what we need to do . " <p> CONSEQUENCES FOR OTHERS <p> Smith said it has not been enough . Her home on Palace Court , which is underneath the hillside where the scrap heap was discovered , is not in the footprint of the contaminated area and Southampton has refused to extend its offer to buy those homes . Smith and her husband have delayed plans to relocate out of state because they fear they could not sell their home for a decent price . <p> Smith said there have been other consequences  --  she has put off having children because of fears about potential exposure to hazardous materials . She also cut back her business of selling skin products because she spends so much time poring through environmental documents and contractor work plans . <p> " There 's a lot of questions about where we would be right now if this had n't consumed our lives for the last three years , " Smith said . " We would have been much more productive in building our future . " <p> Busfield , who sells window treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession with finding out what is buried under Rose Drive . <p> " My job is shot career-wise , " Busfield said . " There 's no way I can concentrate on work . My whole life is fighting this thing . I have to find out what 's here and fight for my family 's health and well-being . " <p> CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS IN BENICIA <p> The state Department of Toxic Substances Control and the Southampton development company are investigating the extent of contamination around the Rose Drive area in Benicia , which was built on top of an abandoned landfill . <p> The main areas of contamination are : <p> 1 . Rose Drive at Blake Court . Hazardous materials , including lead , chromium and other metals have been discovered in the soil and seven homes have been vacated because of health concerns . <p> 2 . Palace Court off Rose Drive . Rusty metal from a scrap heap began appearing through the soil earlier this year . The site was supposed to have been cleaned up before homes were built . <p> 3 . Cambridge Drive off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks containing a petroleum product from the site to see if groundwater was polluted . The excavation , completed this month , turned up two tanks along with other debris that was not supposed to have been buried in the area , state officials say .
