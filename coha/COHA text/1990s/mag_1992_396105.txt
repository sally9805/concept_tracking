Smiling modestly and sitting on a golden throne while two young bare-breasted virgins fanned him in 90-degree weather and two small boys stood guard , megastar Michael Jackson was crowned " King of Sani " in a West African village . During impressive ceremonies observed by a huge crowd , the 33-year-old entertainer was regal in his bearing as a crown of gold was placed upon his head by Amon N'Djafok , the traditional tribal chief of the Village of Krindjabo , Ivory Coast , West Africa . The shy singing sensation who once told JET that he " would rather blaze trails than follow in someone 's footsteps , " had been sitting silently and smiling brightly beneath a special canopy reserved for a person of high rank as his four Black American bodyguards stood nearby . Wearing an orange shirt and black pants , Jackson removed his trade-mark black fedora hat which was replaced by a crown of glittering gold . Hundreds of proud people from the gold-mining village occupied by the Agni Tribe , located near Abidjan , Ivory Coast , cheered loudly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmed in gold and placed a six-foot scepter of gold in his right hand . A choral group of aged and revered women , wearing white robes , sang and chanted on the grounds to invoke the ancestors . The energetic entertainer who already wore the title of " King of Pop , Rock and Soul " for selling more albums than any other artist in the history of recording worldwide , stood in front of the throne that was below a sacred village tree . He was told that he was on the land of his ancestors as the " prodigal child of the Bible . " Filled with emotions , Jackson acknowledged his elevation to the royal rank as honorary " King of Sani " and responded with six words . Using the language of the French-speaking West African peoples , he exclaimed : " Merci beaucoup ! " " King Sani " then used the English translation : " Thank you very much ! " He then sat down . When the ceremonies concluded , Jackson remained for a short time to pay respect to the village chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A proud tribe of people who were forced into exile from Ghana , a neighbor nation , in the 18th Century , they settled in the Ivory Coast and founded their own kingdom and have managed to keep their own monarchy . " Coming from Ghana , the Gold Coast at that time , gold has always been a symbol of power for the Agni , " an Ivory Coast handbook reveals . " Therefore , they decorate those being honored at ceremonies with heavy jewelry " of gold . Jackson , who had already been honored with Gabon 's highest Medal of Honor by President Omar Bongo , who hosted Jackson 's " Come Back To Eden " tour , departed for other African nations  --  Tanzania and Egypt , the cradle of civilization , which Jackson portrayed in a music video , Remember The Time from his Dangerous album ( JET , Feb. 17 ) . While Jackson was touring the African nations , where he visited hospitals inhabited by ill children , orphanages , schools , churches and institutions for mentally retarded children , he was apprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . " The anti-Jackson newspaper and broadcast reports came as a shocking surprise to Jackson and the 26 persons he had chosen to accompany him  --  including JET Associate Publisher Robert E. Johnson and JET/EBONY/EM photographer James Mitchell . When they collected the press clippings , the Jackson entourage listed the 10 biggest lies told about the sensitive singer who is also known worldwide for his humanity and philanthropy . These are the lies : 1 ) The trip was " a public relations disaster for Michael . " 2 ) " The singer cut short an African tour after early stopovers generated the wrong kind of excitement . " 3 ) Jackson leaves behind him some confusion about why he came to Africa in the first place ... " 4 ) He held his hand to his nose because the Ivory Coast is " underdeveloped , impure " and the " air is polluted , infested with germs " and he did n't want to " inhale it . " 5 ) He collapsed from the heat . 6 ) He was in South Africa filming a movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kenya . 8 ) He refused to shake hands with people . 9 ) He went to London for a medical appointment . 10 ) He is " neither Black or White " and is not a good role model for children . As an eyewitness on the tour , there is no truth in the above lies told about the world 's greatest entertainer who had a love-in with his fans who cheered and applauded him everywhere he appeared . Although the men who accompanied him were peeved over the media mess , the modest musical messenger was unruffled  --  mainly because he refused to read the stories . Moreover , his Dangerous album responds to such criticisms in the song , Why You Wan na Trip On Me . The song says , in part : " They say I 'm different/They do n't understand/But there 's a bigger problem/That 's much more in demand/You got world hunger Not enough to eat/So there 's really no time/To be trippin ' on me ... " We 've got more problems/Than we 'll ever need/ You got gang violence/And bloodshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no clothes on their back/And no shoes for their feet ... /Tell me what are you doing/To try to stop this/Why you wan na trip on me ... /Stop trippin . " The thrilling tone for Jackson 's tour was cast when he set his feet upon the mineral and oil-rich soil of Gabon , West Africa ( population : 1,068,240 ) , where more than 100,000 frenzied fans feted him , and the cheers continued until he concluded the tour in Tanzania , East Africa ( population : 25,970,843 ) . It was there that one enthusiastic fan , Shyrose Bhanji , shook Jackson 's hand and told a Tanzania Standard Newspaper ( TNS ) reporter : " I could n't believe that his hands could possibly be softer than mine . I am not too sure if I will wash my hands for at least two weeks . " Shyrose 's hand was not the only hand the amiable ambassador of love touched while touring the land of his ancestors . Wherever he went to meet and mingle , Jackson touched , hugged and kissed his fans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I 'm on stage , I ca n't perform if I do n't have that kind of ping-pong with the crowd . " Although he did n't go to Africa to perform onstage or promote his Dangerous album , he had " that kind of ping-pong " with crowds  --  especially with children he visited in hospitals , schools and orphanages . " There 's a certain sense that animals and children have that gives me a certain creative juice , a certain force that later on in adulthood is lost because of the conditioning that happens in the world , " the prolific performer said . " When I see children , I see that God has not yet given up on man . A great poet from India , ( Rabindranath ) Tagore , said that and I agree with him , " allowed the well-read entertainer who purchased books and videos in every city he visited . But it was in Tanzania that Jackson , who sings songs of love and peace , discovered he was in a county that proclaims that it is The Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed down the ramp of the plane after it landed in Dar es Salaam , the capital of Tanzania , he inquired about security that would control the large crowd at the airport terminal . " Where are the police and the soldiers ? " a man clad in a safari uniform with short sleeves was asked . " I 'm a policeman , " he said , pointing to the silver badge pinned above his shirt pocket . " Where is your gun ? , " he was asked . The policeman responded : " We do n't wear guns . We 're civilized . We do n't have soldiers here because we 're not at war with Michael Jackson . " It was against this backdrop that Tanzania President Ali Hassan Mwinyi hosted the popular entertainer and urged him to publicize the East African nation 's rich tourism potential in the United States . President Mwinyi observed that the talented titan 's tour of Tanzania would enlighten him of the country 's potential in tourism so that " you become our envoy by publicizing Tanzania 's richness in wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of animals , especially the chimpanzees , the multi-millionaire musician promised to contribute toward a wildlife conservation fund and toward children from his Heal The World Foundation . He made the latter pledge after an emotional visit to the Sinza Centre for Mentally Retarded Children , where hundreds of his fans ringed the building and lined both sides of the street that led to the Centre , where his surprise appearance generated great excitement . Shortly before Jackson was scheduled to take off for a visit to Kenya , he was suddenly summoned to London for pressing business matters pertaining to his world tour set to begin this summer . It turned out to be an act of fate because the entertainer would have arrived amidst a political conflict in which opposition was pressing for the resignation of Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi and refugees fleeing a conflict in neighboring Somalia created further disruption in the nation . However , Jackson said he merely postponed his visit and intends to perform there in the future . Before leaving for London , Bob Jones , vice president of communication , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jackson held his nose because " he could not stand the smell in the land of his ancestors . " Jones said that Jackson , who was nicknamed " Smelly " by Quincy Jones , was merely exhibiting a nervous twitch . " Mr. Jackson has been performing since he was five years old but he is quite a bashful person ... Under no circumstances would we be here if we thought your country smelled . " Charles Bobbit , a consultant to President Bongo , initiated the idea for the trip in consultation with Jones . He got the support of President Bongo to allow Gabon to be the host country along with the support of the president 's son , Ali , and his daughter , Mademoiselle Pascaline Bongo , who is the nation 's foreign minister . " It was Ali 's useful knowledge , information , skills and fluency with the French language that made the venture a success , " Bobbit told JET . He added that it was Jackson 's stated desire " to visit orphanages and children 's hospitals in each city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction between Michael and the children . He sat on the bed with children who were deformed and children that were ill . He sat there and talked to them , held them , cuddled them . He shook their hands . He did not wear a surgical mask like he does sometimes in America and had no fear of contagious diseases , of which there was no danger like that anyway . The myth of Michael Jackson is that he is afraid of germs . This is absolutely wrong because he cares about children . Many people say it but he does it . He cares . That 's what qualifies him as a role model for childrenhis deeds and not his looks . " Bobbit added : " I 'm glad that JET and EBONY magazines were with us because they will tell it and show it as it is . " <p>
