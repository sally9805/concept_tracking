If the months of the year were put on parade in San Antonio , Texas , and a popular vote taken , April would undoubtedly emerge as the hands-down favorite . April brings both the sweetest weather and the biggest parties of the year . But this April felt more like June in the steadiness of its heat , and on this particular April morning an unusual tension augmented the heat . Strangers in the normally friendly city were less likely to greet one another on the street . Instead there were wary , sidelong glances , and strollers downtown walked to their cars a little faster . At the center of this uneasiness stood the Bexar County Justice Center , the criminal courthouse on the edge of downtown . There the tension went undisguised . Protestors in front of the building carried signs . Occasionally one shouted angrily . The protestors were dwarfed by the imposing five-story stone building , but employees in the building felt their presence . Guards at the entrance of the Justice Center watched the protestors with hands resting on gun butts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odor . It emanated from a third-floor courtroom . The courtroom could n't accommodate everyone who had wanted to watch the trial in progress . Some of the people who had been turned away milled in the hallway , waiting with the television cameramen and sometimes standing on tiptoes to try to get a glimpse through the glass doors of the court . Inside the courtroom , spectators sat packed shoulder to shoulder . The judge and the armed bailiffs had shushed the crowd more than once , and no one spoke , they strained to hear the witnesses and the lawyers . But the mere breathing of so many people created a low background noise in the courtroom . At the front of the courtroom the District Attorney of Bexar County , Chris Sinclair , shook his head and said , " No more questions , your Honor . " Seconds later the judge 's gavel banged down , declaring a long lunch recess . Chris spoke briefly to his assistant , then stood and turned toward the courtroom 's exit . He reached the gate in the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men looked at each other . An alert newspaper photographer brought up his camera and snapped a photo of the two that would soon become famous . The picture was brilliant in its contrasts : Chris Sinclair the fresh , steady District Attorney who looked too young to have been a trial lawyer for almost fifteen years . He had been elected District Attorney only six months earlier . A newspaper columnist had dubbed the Christian Sinclair campaign " Blond Ambition , " and had gone on to say , " His name looks as good on the ballot as his face does on billboards . " Chris had come out of nowhere as far as the public was concerned when he had announced his candidacy , but he had surprised himself by being a good campaigner , thoughtful and confidence-inspiring . But first , as many lawyers in San Antonio would ruefully acknowledge , he was a damned good trial lawyer . He had proven that again in one trial since his election , but this current trial was very different . The prosecution of Malachi Reese was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger shadows across the city . Major consequences waited to pounce on the outcome of the trial . The defendant stood close to the District Attorney at the gate in the railing : older , African-American , looking confidently but curiously into his persecutor 's eyes . And clearly many saw Malachi Reese as the persecuted , as a black man being unjustly attacked by a white establishment for which Christian Sinclair served as the perfect poster boy . After that one frozen moment Malachi Reese smiled cordially and held the gate open . Chris went through it and made his way through the crowd . Reese followed more slowly , stopping to receive the encouragement of his supporters and to talk to the many reporters . Malachi Reese had not come out of nowhere to be the center of attention at his own trial . For the average citizen of San Antonio Reese fulfilled the definition of local celebrity : he was well-known for being well-known . People recognized him as having been a part of the fabric of public life for some years , without being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community groups and responsible for several successful political campaigns , Reese had never run for office himself . Mostly he moved in the background of committees and conferences , but when he did step forward he drew attention . When he served as a spokesman he exhibited the authority and confidence of a leader . People nodded along as he spoke . Even in confrontation , he retained his composure . In the battlefields of emotion , no one wielded logic more forcefully than Malachi Reese . Reese had brought those same skills to his trial for capital murder . Nearing fifty years old , handsome and well-groomed , he looked distinguished in his dark gray suit . The suit 's subtle pattern seemed to compliment his dark brown skin . Old photos showed Reese sporting an Afro of impressive depth , but those days were gone . His black hair was of a medium cut now , more curly than kinky , and going sagely gray around his ears . His small , trim beard made him look Christ-like . An invisible spotlight always seemed to be picking him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to give a group interview to the cluster of reporters . Wearing an expression of sad bafflement , Reese looked like a strong man caught in a Kafkaesque puzzle : confronting lies so outrageous he could barely respond . Malachi Reese 's face was his vocation . Even while listening his face communicated . His expression slid from concentration to concern to observation . One never doubted that Reese really heard the speaker . He had thoughtful answers to every question , until the questions ceased and his voice flowed on , a river of gold . People listening to that voice not only found it impossible to believe that Reese had committed a brutal double murder , they found it impossible even to hold the accusation in their minds . Ludicrous , they thought . One reporter trailed Chris Sinclair down the hall to ask the question Chris had been asked repeatedly in the last few weeks . The reporter phrased it formally : " Do you really believe Malachi Reese murdered city employee Victor Fuentes as well as a witness at the scene ? Do you really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused and looked back down the Justice Center hallway , half expecting the reporter to add , because no one else does . Chris , too , felt the tug of Reese 's voice . But he turned to the reporter and said , " Yes and yes . Just wait until you hear this afternoon 's testimony . " His voice sounded more certain than Chris felt . His case against Malachi Reese was so solid that he had had no choice but to prosecute ; everyone on his staff agreed with that . Soon after Chris 's election , as if waiting to pounce on the winner , very believable witnesses had brought him evidence that Reese 's respectable public life was a facade . The false front covered a subterranean life of grim depth and reach . Chris had discovered that Reese had been more deeply involved in public life than anyone knew , but in a secret , ruthless way . He had n't been a background figure at all . Reese had been the pivot on which large stage sets of corruption and fear turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel of a face convey innocence and bafflement , even the District Attorney entertained doubts about his own case . Chris Sinclair was losing the image war . And until he called his final and most crucial witness , the trial 's outcome remained in heavy doubt as well . During this recess the trial spectators had flowed out into the hall as well . It was easy to tell which were Malachi Reese 's supporters . They were the ones who glared at the District Attorney . The people of all ethnic groups who came to trial every day to support Reese were serious people , many of them well-dressed , most softspoken . Chris had to work his way through the edge of a crowd of them as he proceeded down the hallway . A few made angry eye contact , but they did n't impede Chris 's progress . Outside the Justice Center were demonstrators of a different kind . The security guard at the outside door said , " I think it would be better if you exit through the sheriff 's office entrance and let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chris followed the guard 's gaze to the sidewalks and small parking lot in front of the Justice Center . Twenty or thirty people milled around , watching the Justice Center . A few carried signs , which they shook energetically at the two TV-news vans parked on the asphalt . The two signs Chris could see said " Free Malachi " and " Racist Persecution . " Most of the protestors were black , but not all . They 'd been standing in the parking lot now for days , and for two or three hours this morning , waiting . Most looked dispirited . As a group they gave off an air of menace , but when Chris looked at individual protestors he did n't sense danger . People who took the time to make signs were n't too threatening . " It 'll be okay , " he said to the security guard , and walked out the doors . He walked briskly but not hurriedly -- his habitual pace -- toward the street . Sunshine lit his face and blond hair . " There ! " someone yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd converged on Chris , but he 'd been right , they were n't physically threatening . Only one man breached the invisible barrier around the District Attorney . A tall black man with a scarred cheek stepped into Chris 's path so they almost bumped . The man was around forty , and bore the marks of a hard life . His eyes burned . " You hate us all so much ? " he asked fiercely . Chris stopped . He stared back . " I do n't hate you . Or anyone else here . But I prosecute criminals , yes . Instead of standing out here working yourselves up , why do n't you come in and watch the trial ? Especially my last witness . Then make up your mind . " They held each other 's eyes in a moment that threatened to last forever , until Chris finally said , " All right ? " and walked on . No one stopped him . The April sunlight felt aimed . After the confined mustiness of the courtroom , and the air-conditioned sterility of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He closed his eyes and tilted his face upward . He was momentarily warmed , then heated as the sunlight clamped onto his dark , navy blue suit . The judge in Malachi Reese 's capital murder trial , Judge Phil Pressman , never one to miss a photo opportunity , had recessed the trial long enough to attend , and incidentally , allow the District Attorney to attend , a civic event of a peculiarly carnival-like righteousness : the razing of a crack house , part of the city 's effort to rehabilitate crime-plagued neighborhoods . This residential east side block shrank from the attendant hoopla . The poor neighborhood should have been middle class . When the houses had been built in the fifties they had been pretty two- and three-bedroom wooden cottages , some of them more substantial brick . If the yards had been watered and a little paint applied the street could have been pleasant again . But the spirit of upkeep had been squashed . The discouraged atmosphere of the neighborhood emanated from this hollowed-out shell of a house where men met to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman for a six-minute financial exchange . No one would argue that bulldozing the house might not be a worthy project , but the atmosphere put Chris off . The little yellow house needed paint worse than its neighbors did , but otherwise it was like any other house on the block . But this morning the house looked like a surprised jaywalking suspect suddenly surrounded by the SWAT team . The crowd on the front lawn of the house consisted of curious spectators , the mayor of San Antonio , the chief of police , other civic leaders , and news crews . Speeches had to precede the demolition . A good deed was only half done if credit for it went ungrasped . When Chris had arrived in the mostly black neighborhood , a police officer had approached him quickly and said , " I do n't know if you want to be here , sir . " Chris had his doubts too , but only because of the self-glorification of the occasion , not the neighborhood . The stares he received from the small crowd felt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies the District Attorney stood apart , off to the side , on the cracked sidewalk with a view of an unscreened side window of the marked house . Spray-painted gang graffiti covered the wall , an important verb missing where the housepaint underneath had cracked and fallen away in a large patch . A bitter voice suddenly interrupted the D.A . ' s thoughts . " I grew up in that house . " A black woman stood beside him , very young but with a fat-bellied toddler playing around her feet and a baby in her arms . Chris turned toward her apologetically , expecting to see her looking at the house with regretful nostalgia . But her face showed barely suppressed rage . Her eyes glistened . The house stood as a monument to something she wanted desperately to forget . " Can I throw the first match ? " she said . Chris wanted to put his arm around her . He settled for a hand on her shoulder . She did n't seem to feel it . She continued to stare at the house , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without glancing at the District Attorney she said , " You 're the one trying to kill Mr. Reese , are n't you ? " Chris decided not to argue with her characterization of his job . " Yes . " The young woman shook her head . " Wo n't help , " she said . Chris found this an interesting response . He wanted to turn his back on the house-bashing ceremonies and listen to her . She seemed the voice of the city embodied . But the woman did n't much want to talk . She walked away , following the little boy as he explored a path that led around the side of the house . Seeing someone beckoning him to take the microphone on the front porch , Chris pretended not to see , and followed the little family . When they turned the corner they were out of sight of the festivities in front of the house . Yellow police tape strung from sawhorses isolated the house , but the little boy casually walked right under the tape and then spurted ahead , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the young mother shouted , shifting the baby awkwardly . " I 'll go , " Chris said . He stepped over the tape as easily as Benjy had gone under it , and darted around the corner . He saw the little boy running toward the back stoop , a sagging slab of concrete that had come detached from the house . Chris put on speed , but the boy had almost reached the stoop . Chris called his name , which made the boy run faster and stumble , falling toward the concrete . A figure in blue appeared from the other corner of the house and caught the boy . Benjy screamed and struggled . He reached for Chris , who suddenly became his friend when the boy was confronted by an even less familiar figure . Chris took him from the uniformed policeman . The officer had disguised his extreme youth by pulling his uniform hat down low on his brow . Appearing to recognize the District Attorney , he accounted for himself . " Just about to make a last check before the demolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set Benjy down and watched him run to his mother . When Chris straightened up the young cop was still close in front of him . " Did you hear something , sir ? " They both stepped up onto the tiny porch , which gave the illusion of listing further with their weight . They stood at the rectangular hole from which the back door was missing . There was definitely a sound , but whether it came from inside the house or only carried through from the crowd in front was impossible to say . Chris started to step in , but the young cop stopped him . " Ca n't go into a situation like this without backup . " He sounded as if he were quoting . He looked the District Attorney over quickly , as if assessing him for the backup role , then said , " Could you just step down from the porch , sir , while I go get another officer ? " Chris complied . The young officer walked away , but stopped to usher the young woman and her children toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , walking slowly to keep Benjy in sight . When they were gone Chris stepped back to the house 's doorway . He heard the sound again , a human disturbance of the air . It could have been a moan . Chris looked into the dim interior and could n't see anything . If the police officer had n't been there , Benjy could have gone in this doorway . Another child might have gone in , or a befuddled homeless man . Chris stepped through the doorway . Inside the house felt like another dimension . The sunlight disappeared without a trace , and the tiny sound of boards shifting was louder than the crowd noise from outside . Even when his eyes adjusted to the gloom Chris felt divorced from the outer world . Many of the house 's interior walls had been knocked down . Standing in the kitchen , he could see most of the thousand or so square feet of the house 's interior . There were a couch and an armchair in what had been the living room , a kitchen table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was furnished with clutter , disintegrating cardboard boxes and stacks of newspaper . The electricity had been shut off long ago , stilling the hum of modern life . Chris could have been inside a cave instead of a onetime home . The house was so dim inside Chris could n't see what he was putting his foot on . It felt like linoleum , with a yielding undersurface that spoke of termites or fire . He stepped cautiously , calling " Hello ? " A dull boom broke the silence and the whole house shuddered . On the front porch the chief of police had just swung a sledgehammer , bashing a symbolic dent in the house 's front wall . A bulldozer cleared its throat . Chris decided to go back and wait for the police . But then he heard a moan and knew for certain he was n't alone inside the house . The sound had been of pain . No longer thinking of danger , Chris walked toward the dilapidated old couch in the living area . As he drew closer he saw a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a statue carved out of wood . But then the man 's hand lifted and he coughed . With a shock Chris recognized the old man 's face . He rushed to him and supported the head the man was trying to lift . " Mr. Rodriguez , " Chris said . " How did you --  ? My God , what --  ? " He knew the old man from hours spent interviewing him . Chris had expected to be calling him as a witness an hour from now . The old couch was missing most of its cushions . Springs poked out through its threadbare fabric . It exhaled dust at the slightest movement , so the old man would have had trouble breathing just from lying there . Chris got under him and held the old man up . He felt almost weightless . His cough turned into a mumble , but when he opened his mouth blood gushed onto his shirt . Mr. Rodriguez 's hands had been strong . He had been a carpenter , an artisan . But when he tried to grab Chris his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been the hands of the toddler Chris had been holding a few minutes before . Chris stared . Mr. Rodriguez grew very still . " Hold on , " Chris said loudly . " There 're people just outside . Hang on , Mr. Rodriguez , they 'll have an ambulance here in five minutes . " But he did n't leave the old man . Mr. Rodriguez 's lips were moving , and Chris bent close . " Tell me , " he whispered . Dust motes danced . Veins stood out on the backs of the old man 's deep brown hands . His hair was thin and white . One eye was cloudy . Chris fought for control of his emotions as he leaned his ear close to Mr. Rodriguez 's lips . He held the tendoned hand tightly . A minute later the front door crashed inward . When police entered they found the District Attorney in tears holding a body , the dead man 's blood staining them both . Chris Sinclair had n't realized . He 'd been told that Malachi Reese had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the jury believe -- but he had n't believed it himself , not in the visceral way he should have . Now too late he understood : Malachi Reese would win this trial no matter what he had to do . Chris moved in his own world of shock and disbelief . At the scene , while he still wore Adolfo Rodriguez 's blood , a cop asked , " Shall we call the court , sir ? I 'm sure they 'll grant a delay so --  " then stopped as he realized neither his touch nor his voice was penetrating the District Attorney 's consciousness . An hour later Chris entered the courtroom wearing a fresh shirt . By then everyone had heard the story of what he had found inside the crack house . Onlookers gave him shocked and curious stares , but the prosecutor did n't notice . He had eyes only for his defendant . Malachi Reese sat at the defense table with his two lawyers . The judge 's bench and the jury box were still empty , so the three figures stood out at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assistant , Melissa Fleming , turned to look at him . But Chris saw only Malachi Reese . Reese should have felt the weight of that stare , but it was n't until Chris passed through the gate in the railing , making the gate creak slightly , that Reese turned . When Reese looked up he seemed startled . He spoke in a soft voice , but it carried to the many spectators already assembled in the courtroom . " What 's wrong ? " he said . " What 's happened to you ? " His voice conveyed selfless concern . Chris heard a different undertone nonetheless . Nothing gave Reese away , but Chris stared at him as if he saw someone utterly different from the person everyone else in the courtroom watched . " All rise , " said the bailiff , and Judge Pressman hastily settled himself behind the bench . Pressman was a skillful enough politician to have gotten himself elected twice to this criminal district court bench . He needed to be a judge because as a lawyer he 'd been useless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darting eyes , and an unfortunately sudden way of moving his arms and shoulders that tended to draw attention to him even on those rare occasions when he was n't seeking it . As now , when he stared at the District Attorney with sincere helpfulness . " Mr. Sinclair , do you have a request before we reconvene ? " They were the first spoken words Chris had understood since he 'd been delicately escorted out of the crack house . Coming to himself in the courtroom , he realized he did n't know how he 'd gotten here , but his gaze moved from the judge back to the defendant and his face changed . " No , thank you , your Honor , " he said distinctly . " The State calls Lou Briones . " Judge Pressman looked sharply at the District Attorney , but then turned to his bailiff with a shrug . The bailiff opened a back door of the courtroom to admit the jurors , who filed quickly into their seats in the jury box . The jurors were not sequestered during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go their separate ways during the long lunch recess . If two or three of them had heard a passing news report of the murder victim in the crack house , they would have no idea how that news related to this trial . But the jurors could sense that something had changed . The District Attorney appeared to have lost touch with the world . He did n't even notice his assistant who touched him lightly and asked a soft question as the D.A . took his seat beside her . He did n't even look at his own witness coming up the aisle of the courtroom . But the District Attorney 's distraction lent heightened anticipation to this witness . The jurors and spectators watched him intently , and there was more than one audible gasp . Everyone knew the name Lou Briones , but they wondered if they were mistaken . Briones was a former city councilman , but much better known as his own TV pitchman for his chain of appliance stores . He was a big , hearty man , with a good laugh and meaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand on one to demonstrate its solidness . But this figure shuffling to his place at the witness stand was the shocking ghost of Lou Briones . Gaunt and pale , his hand trembled slightly as he took the oath . Lou Briones looked half departed from this world . Chris 's assistant Melissa quietly asked whether she should take the witness , but Chris shook his head and said in a clear voice , " Would you please identify yourself ? " The witness raised his head , which made the loose flesh of his neck quiver . He turned toward the jury , knowing they knew him . " My name is Lou Briones . " " Do you know the defendant , Mr. Briones ? " Briones looked at Reese across the narrow space of the front of the courtroom . His gaze offered no greeting , hardly even recognition . His voice went flat . " Malachi , yes . I know him professionally , politically . Personally , too . I guess I know him as well as anybody . " " What about Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an assistant city manager . " The important word was " was . " Victor Fuentes had been the primary victim of the capital murder for which Malachi Reese was being prosecuted . " What was he like , Mr. Briones ? " " Victor ? " Briones sounded surprised to be asked . His voice turned reminiscent . " He was young . That was the main thing about Victor , he had no history . If you 'd been off city council for two terms he did n't know you . He was twenty -- what ? five ? six ? Had a good degree from someplace , you know . He was ambitious , anybody could see that . It made you think he could be worked with . I think now , though , his ambition ran a different direction . " " Why was Victor Fuentes killed ? " Chris asked . " Because he 'd discovered a little corner of Malachi Reese 's business . Malachi --  " " Objection ! " The slender defense lawyer in his crisp suit made an impressive arrow when he shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malachi Reese had hired Leo Pedraza , who happened to be the District Attorney Chris Sinclair had replaced . But for trial they 'd brought in a smooth young trial stud named Jackson Scott who in fact reminded some observers of Chris in his younger days . Leo Pedraza now sat second chair . " This testimony is obviously based on hearsay , your Honor , " Scott said . Judge Pressman turned inquiringly toward the District Attorney . The judge preferred if possible to be helped out rather than rule on an objection . " My next question will answer that , " Chris said . Judge Pressman waved him gratefully on . " May I have a ruling on my objection ? " the young defense lawyer said . The formality hiding the contempt in his voice had grown thinner as the trial had progressed . His opinion of the judge was now an audible wedge in everything he said . " After the next question , " the judge said reasonably . The lawyers sat . Chris asked , " Mr. Briones , how do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malachi Reese 's business ? " " Because it was my business too , " Briones said . Overruled , Judge Pressman mouthed silently at the defense lawyer , who sulked . Briones continued . " We were on a team bidding for a city contract . I was part of the group , Malachi was -- he was hired as a consultant to the team . It was a big contract , maybe fifty million dollars , to build an expansion to the waste treatment plant . We --  " " Why were you on the team , Mr. Briones ? What expertise do you have in waste treatment ? " " I know which way shit runs , son . " A few spectators laughed , but that was n't Lou Briones ' object . He was grim . He had hunkered his shoulders high and inward , as if gathering his strength . He wheezed between his sentences . His ears , big and pendulous , hung like burdens on his head . Briones was only sixty , but he looked older , because the flesh on his face sagged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd pulled out of the back of the closet . " Here 's the way a contract bid works --  " " Objection , your Honor , " Jackson Scott said dispiritedly . " Relevance ? " Lou Briones , the former city councilman , not used to being interrupted , turned toward the judge irritatedly . He was obviously about to say , Ca n't you shut this kid up ? " It goes to motive , your Honor , " Chris helped out . " Overruled , overruled . Let 's get on with it . " " The way a contract bid works , " Briones repeated , glaring at the defense lawyer , " is you put together the best team you can --  " " To get the job done ? " Chris asked innocently . " To get the contract , " Briones said acidly . " Job 'll get done , everybody knows that . Question is , who 's gon na make the money off it ? So we had a good team . Me , of course ; then a good architecture firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made significant contributions . " Chris did n't want to play into the act anymore , but he had to ask the clarifying questions . " Political contributions ? " " Yeah , campaign contributions , to city council members . And we had Malachi , of course . " " What was the defendant supposed to bring to the team ? " Chris asked , turning to look at him . Reese appeared bemused , as if listening to an elementary civics lesson that had nothing to do with him . " Who knew exactly ? " Briones answered , not coyly . " Sort of the back-room influence . He was owed more favors than anybody in this town . Certainly if you had Malachi on your team you were supposed to be guaranteed the east side councilman 's vote . Probably west side , too . And just -- grease the process . " " What did this have to do with Victor Fuentes ? " Chris asked . He knew the questions , he had rehearsed this testimony . His voice continued , strong and properly inflected , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crack house . He turned wondering eyes on Malachi Reese . Reese never looked back , never even glanced in Chris 's direction . Briones said slowly , " The process has gotten -- trickier --  " Less obviously corrupt , Chris translated silently . " Used to be you had the team you had the contract , no problem . Nowadays it helps a lot if you can get the city staff recommendation too . That meant getting Victor Fuentes on your side . He was in charge of evaluating the bids . I talked to him , kind of -- made sure he knew the facts of life . He was -- he was almost rude to me . " Briones gazed across the room , his voice still sounding shocked . " He not only made fun of our bid offer , he said he was looking into some other stuff , old business . He said he wanted to know where we got off bidding on construction projects anyway . He was looking particularly into a contract that had been awarded when I 'd been on the council , that I 'd voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid also ? " " Oh yes . And let 's just say , we did n't want that one looked into . " Chris had no intention of inquiring into other crimes , not yet . He could feel the defense lawyer getting edgy beside him , ready to spring to his feet . " So what did you do ? " " I talked to Malachi . That 's what he was there for . We talked over what we might do and finally Malachi said he 'd have a word with Victor Fuentes . " Briones leaned heavily on the last phrase and shifted uncomfortably in his seat . The air was pleasant in the courtroom , but sweat stains were growing under the armpits of Lou Briones ' seersucker suit . His breathing was heavier . " What did that mean to you ? " Chris asked quietly . " May we approach the bench ? " Jackson Scott asked , already doing so , buttoning his black suit coat , stiff and straight as righteous indignation . Chris followed him . At the bench the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to call for testimony implying extraneous offenses . I strongly object to any such testimony , your Honor . It would render this trial completely unfair and reversible . " He said the last word sharply , to get Judge Pressman 's attention . He succeeded . The judge turned to the prosecutor with obvious concern . " Mr. Sinclair , you 're not going to --  " " Your Honor , I will keep the testimony as discreet as possible , but I must establish a pattern to put this witness 's testimony in context . Otherwise it will sound like idle speculation . " The judge vaguely understood the word " context " as having a legal meaning . He thought he 'd heard it before . " All right , " he said authoritatively . " I 'll give you some leeway --  " He knew he 'd heard that word in a legal discussion . He had : it had been on a TV series . "  - -  but not much , " he added quickly , to placate the glowering defense lawyer . In that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back to their places . Briones had taken the opportunity to rest , staring at the floor . His chest moved as he breathed . " What did that phrase mean to you , Mr. Briones ? " " It was what Malachi said . It was always the end of a discussion . It meant he 'd take care of the problem . " " How ? " " However it took . Whatever had to be done , he 'd do it . Whatever it took . I told him -- well , I tried to say that we did n't need to do anything drastic , but Malachi looked at me like I was speaking Hungarian . When I read that Victor Fuentes was dead , I knew who had killed him . I remembered Malachi had planned a meeting with him , and I remembered what he 'd said . There are some important people in this town , let me tell you , who went cold when Malachi Reese said he was going to have a word with somebody . " Dimly aware of a growing buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " So other people , elected officials , knew about Mr. Reese 's activities ? " " Some knew a little , the way I did , from personal experience . But nobody knew any details . They just knew that things happened . I could n't believe you found an eyewitness to this one . " " Objection , " the defense lawyer snapped . " Hearsay . " " Sustained , " Judge Pressman said , and instructed the jury to disregard the witness 's statement , knowing how ineffective that instruction would be . During the interruption Chris looked past the defense lawyer at Malachi Reese . The defendant still would n't look at Chris . He stared at the witness Lou Briones , Reese shaking his head slowly , like an innocent man unwilling to sit quietly and listen to lies . But the D.A . was sure Reese knew Chris was watching him . Mention of the eyewitness put a gleam in Reese 's eye , but only Chris could see it . Chris asked a question that put the defense on the alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really know for a fact , Mr. Briones , that Mr. Reese did anything to Victor Fuentes ? You 're just guessing . " " I know , " Briones said thickly . " You had to have known Malachi for a long time , the way I did , know how he got where he was . Malachi was n't just Johnny-on-the-spot , he was ahead of everybody . While everybody else was just talking , you 'd discover that Malachi had already done what some powerful person wanted done -- before he was even asked . He would make happen what they most secretly wanted to have happen . So afterward you feel both guilty and afraid , like it sprang out of your own head . " Chris watched Reese , this monster from the id . Reese continued to look sad and perplexed , but Chris thought he saw a flash of pride at hearing himself described . " If people knew what he had done in some of these cases , Mr. Briones , why did n't they go to the police ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went to the police and say , I know who killed X. ' How do you know ? ' " they say , and you say , Because he did it for me . ' And the cops 'd go , That 's right , X was your political rival , was n't he ? ' Or business competitor , or whatever . Something bad had happened to the one person you hated and feared the most , and you expected the cops to believe someone else did it , someone who had no motive for it at all ? " Briones shook his head . " I do n't know anybody who was willing to take that chance . " Emotionlessly , Chris asked , " Do you expect this jury to believe that Mr. Reese murdered so many people ? " " No . Not murder , not very often . But bad things would happen to problem people . A reporter digging too deep , some little official who needed to step aside but would n't take a hint , somebody like that . Maybe heroin would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would break into a house and not take anything . People got the message . There was a cop we really needed to have off the force , but nobody wanted him spouting accusations on his way out . Then one Monday morning he mailed in his resignation and nobody ever saw him again . Nobody knew exactly what happened , they just knew when Malachi said he 'd have a word with somebody , the problem went away . " Briones stared across the courtroom at the defendant . He looked tired again . " And then , you know , he 'd spend the weekend cleaning up a neighborhood and planting flowers . He brought people out into the sunshine who 'd been afraid to leave their houses for years . He did some good things for this town , I do n't deny that . But he 's the most contradictory man I 've ever known . Most people , you know exactly how they 'll react before you even say anything to them . But Malachi -- sometimes I thought he must be two people . " The defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he should have : distraught , puzzled , painfully innocent , his mouth clenched . In his interviews he had n't blamed anyone for his predicament . He 'd let the writers speculate about his enemies . Reese had only appeared to be trying to figure out why people would have made up such a bizarre fantasy about him . Briones ' testimony might not even be that damaging : the more outrageously sinister he painted Malachi Reese , the greater grew the possibility that this was part of a sinister conspiracy against Reese . " I pass the witness , " the District Attorney said , which appeared to take people in the courtroom by surprise . It seemed too soon . He had piqued their curiosity . They wanted to hear more of the shadowy world of Malachi Reese . Two or three jurors looked at Chris wondering if he had lost his energy or the thread of his questioning . But Jackson Scott was ready . Sitting forward even straighter , he said , " Mr. Briones , you 've described a pattern of criminal behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . Sometimes . " " You and others , public officials , you benefitted in a variety of ways from this great morass of deception and evildoing ? " " Yes . Not on purpose , but --  " Scott would not be interrupted . " But how did Mr. Reese profit ? You say yourself he had no motive . Is n't it fanciful to attribute these misdeeds to Malachi Reese ? " " He did it , " Briones insisted . Speaking as if to a backward child , the defense lawyer said , " To what end , Mr. Briones ? People do n't do things without a reason , do they ? You profited , other people profited , you held onto your public positions . But how could Mr. Reese , who has never shown any political ambition , have benefitted from all this ? " " To what end ? " Briones asked with faint mockery . " Power , of course . People owed Malachi , and they were afraid of him besides . He pulled the strings of the people who pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being mayor or county commissioner . If you do n't understand wanting to control other people , I ca n't explain it to you . " Now out of the game himself , Briones still sounded contemptuous of those who did n't feel that hunger to dominate . " People did what he wanted , " he concluded with a cough . Jackson Scott settled down , as if putting his back into a tug-of-war in which he was certain he could pull the old fool before him right out of the witness box . In an insincere , pleasant tone of voice he said , " You spoke of Mr. Reese 's good deeds . Cleaning up neighborhoods and so forth . That was only the smallest part of what Mr. Reese has done , is n't it , Mr. Briones ? " Briones shrugged . " I said he 's done some good things . " " But that was an understatement , was n't it ? He has cleaned up neighborhoods in the greater sense , has n't he ? Do you remember his organizing the gang summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly two years ago ? " " Yes I do . And did you wonder how Malachi could arrange that when nobody else had been able to ? " " Perhaps because he 's so widely admired in so many quarters , " Scott suggested , and did n't wait for an answer . " He is also responsible for launching an investigation into just the kind of corrupt bidding practice you 've described , was n't he ? Involving a school district contract he had no part of , where he did n't stand to profit in any way . " " That 's true , " Briones said . " And you know the benefit of blowing up a scandal like that ? Do n't look at the guy who got caught . He 's dead , he 's out of it . Look at the guy next to him , with the surprised look on his face . He sees what can happen to him the next time if he steps out of line . " Chris Sinclair paid minimal attention to the exchanges , trusting his witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about what was going to happen next . He did n't know . The points he scored with Lou Briones ' testimony were meaningless . Malachi Reese had already won this duel , outside the courtroom . He 'd turned the court proceeding into a child 's game . Unperturbed , Jackson Scott said , " You have an answer for everything , do n't you , Mr. Briones ? You make every public good Malachi Reese has done into a private evil . But only you know , right ? Only Lou Briones comes forward with the truth . But you are the one with the motive to lie , are n't you , Mr. Briones ? You 've been implicated , so you try to shift the blame as spectacularly as possible . " " I 've admitted my part , " Briones said wearily . " But you 're not being tried for your part , are you ? In fact through your testimony you 're escaping punishment . What sort of deal do you have with the District Attorney 's Office ? " " None . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice sharpened . " Look around , Mr. Briones , and tell me if you think everyone you see is an idiot . The jurors , the judge . You expect us all to believe that , after a lifetime of covering up these crimes , you 've come forward now just because you 've had an attack of conscience ? " " No , " Briones said , causing the defense lawyer to smirk triumphantly . " It 's because I 'm dying . " Even in Chris Sinclair 's despair , he closed his eyes in a brief moment of victory . Thank you , Jackson , for asking the right question . Chris would have brought out Lou Briones ' condition himself on redirect questioning , but it was more effective this way . The defense lawyer sat slack-jawed . " I 've got cancer of the everything , " Briones continued . " When I heard about Victor Fuentes , and about the woman who got killed , too , I could n't forget it . It kept eating at me . Two months after I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briones thought he had willed his own death . He had kept the diagnosis to himself , as he had kept so much secret . But he had rediscovered the church , and his conscience . He had gone to the District Attorney almost six months after the murders to say he knew who had killed Victor Fuentes . The story Briones had told seemed fantastic , but Chris had managed to corroborate some of it . Then he 'd had to rush the case to trial while he still had the former city councilman , whose cancer was very fast-acting . Once Briones had named his disease , everyone in the courtroom could see it was true . The weight loss , the trembling , the letting go of this world . Even people who 'd never seen Lou Briones before could see he was a man being scoured out from the inside . The defense lawyer recovered quickly . Rising to his feet , he said solemnly , " Your Honor , as much sympathy as we all feel toward the witness , it is still true that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely speculative . He was not a witness to anything . His testimony has been inadmissible , and very damaging to my client . I 'll ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard it . And unless the District Attorney has proof that actually implicates Mr. Reese in the crime on trial , I 'll also ask the court to direct a verdict of acquittal , which Mr. Reese richly deserves . " He was right . Even Judge Pressman could see that . Every eye in the courtroom turned toward Chris Sinclair . The one gaze Chris returned was Malachi Reese 's . Reese looked like an innocent man puzzled at the District Attorney 's reluctance to do the right thing . His expression was patient , waiting like everyone else for the State to call its next witness . But Reese knew better . Chris thought he saw , in the depths of the defendant 's eyes , a tiny smile . Reese waited for the District Attorney to rise and acknowledge that he 'd been beaten . Suddenly Chris 's perspective changed . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surroundings . He looked at the jurors and saw paper figures , rippling in the air currents . As Chris Sinclair 's gaze moved he saw only these wafer-thin figures like targets in a pinball game . None of them had the least significance . The judge , the bailiff : no one was real . Then he looked at Malachi Reese and found the exception . Reese was solid and grim and frightening . In the next moment Chris returned to reality . He realized that for a moment he had been seeing through Reese 's eyes . Life was a game to be won at any cost , and the people who got in the way were insignificant . Reese still watched him , but no longer with a trace of a smile . He stared edgily . Chris believed that Reese saw him as real . Suddenly Reese and Chris were the only two people in the world . " Mr. Sinclair ? " The judge raised his voice to get Chris 's attention . Melissa had her hand on Chris 's arm as well , whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge asked , obviously repeating himself . Chris saw Reese 's shoulders lift with a smooth breath . The defendant regained his confidence . Reese was one of two people in the courtroom who knew with complete certainty that the trial was over . At least , the normal trial . Suddenly animated , Chris turned to his assistant and whispered urgently . Melissa whispered back confused questions , but Chris made only one short answer and then rose to his feet . He stood there without a word . Melissa had no choice but to stand too . In a voice she tried to strengthen after she had already started her sentence , she said , " The State calls Chris Sinclair . "
