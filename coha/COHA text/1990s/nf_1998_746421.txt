THIS ESSAY is only one half of an example of what it is concerned with  --  a conversation ; as with all essays that pass themselves off as contributions to a conversation , the reader must provide the other half . Like all such essays , this essay will inevitably suffer from what all one-sided conversations suffer from . In the absence of a real , physically present interlocutor who can interrupt , question , rebut , shrug his or her shoulders , change the subject , and at a pinch walk away entirely , you the reader are at the mercy of my ideas about what this conversation is about You may turn the pages hastily and get on to another essay in this volume ; but you can not redirect the conversation as you would wish . I regret this . Philosophers have regretted it ever since Plato abandoned the persuasively open-ended and unfinished style of the early dialogues and invented the canonical philosophical treatise . Since what follows is a highly speculative treatment of the topics on which I am about to launch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising note , and that the most common punctuation mark in these few pages is not a period , but a " Do you think ? " <p> I tackle three topics , which I rather hesitantly believe to be connected . The first is the recent popularity of " dialogical " notions in political theory and their difference from  --  if they do differ from  --  the ideas of " contractualist " theorists . I start from the fact that Jrgen Habermas has taken an increasingly close interest in American liberal political theory , and raise the obvious question of what separates him from John Rawls particularly , but from the liberal theorists of the past two decades more generally . Second , I explore the popularity of the idea of deliberative democracy , which again sometimes owes allegiance to Habermas , but which has recently been encapsulated in the substantial work of Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson . Third , I look at the popularity of the idea that philosophy is in some sense conversation rather than protoscience , an idea much used by Richard Rorty , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is my own curiosity whether there is anything in common between these recent invocations of the idea of a conversation . I <p> The publication of John Rawls 's masterpiece , A Theory of Justice ( 1971 ) , has rightly been seen as marking an epoch in postwar Anglophone political philosophy . A subject that had been declared dead by innumerable academic and nonacademic critics had been reviving for a decade and a half by the time A Theory of Justice was published ; but a good part of that revival had been the result of the articles on a contractarian theory of justice that Rawls had been publishing since the middle 1950s . Not quite simultaneously , Jrgen Habermas was working his way toward a dialogical rather than a contractarian picture of politics . The route that Habermas has traced is not easy to describe . A thumbnail account might be that he began from a modified Marxism , in which the " productivist " ethic that Marx himself had espoused was reworked so as to rebut any narrowly industrial and utilitarian interpretation of social rationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might say , from Marx through Hegel to Kant  --  though that is too glib . Still , it is true that his concern has increasingly been with the search for valid social norms , whereas Marx and Hegel had hoped to somehow transcend philosophical arguments about the validity of our moral and political ideals . The interest of Habermas 's ideas here lie in the fact that his favored criteria for what is rationally defensible are set out in terms of what is capable of withstanding scrutiny in a dialogue between all interested , informed , and cognitively equipped participants . <p> Both Rawls and Habermas intend to defend some version of the so-called Enlightenment Project . It might be thought that Rawls would resist this claim , since the pluralist liberalism of Political Liberalism is emphatically detached from what Rawls calls " comprehensive doctrines " about the human condition and the ultimate good . Nonetheless , the way Rawls situates his work in the tradition of tolerationist thinking spawned by the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century wars of religion marks out even Political Liberalism as part of the project . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather little to do with the projects that eighteenth-entury Enlightenment thinkers from Diderot through to Kant in fact endorsed , save insofar as it , like those projects , stands or falls by its ability to commend itself to benevolent and rational persons . In the present context , it is the political project that is at issue : the project of creating a liberal democracy in which the ideals of liberal democracy permeate into all areas of social life , and are themselves the expression of still deeper moral attachments . When Rawls detaches political liberalism from a wider liberal worldview , he does not renounce his own reasons for writing Political Liberalism . Rawls expects that persons with quite other world views than his own will have their own reasons for accepting his conclusions and that these reasons will both be rooted in their own view of the world and will at the same time be consilient with his . To hope for that consilience is to hope that the Enlightenment Project can commend itself to other worldviews than that from which it sprang , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In recent years , Habermas and Rawls have taken a considerable interest in one another 's work . This is not the place to ask whether they have always understood each other . It is the place to ask what a contractarian approach yields that a " dialogical " approach does not , and vice-versa : or , whether constitution-building is better understood as conversation or contract There are several things to point to at once . The first is perhaps the most important . In making real-world contracts with someone else , for whatever purpose , we expressly prescind from the other party 's personal , private motivation . I may agree to mow your lawn for ten dollars because I like mowing lawns , because it is the only skill I possess , because it is the only skill that anyone else is willing to purchase from me , and so endlessly on . But all you can demand from me is a mown lawn ; it would be out of bounds for you to ask that I mow it in any particular frame of mind or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mow it . It is just such a separation of my private motivation and my economic obligations that Marx objected to in the Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts when he was characterizing alienated labor . By the same token Kant regarded the separation as the moral grounding of property rights : it allowed each of us to control the external freedom of another without infringing the inner freedom that obedience to the moral law required . <p> If we start from this point , the contractarian image of a liberal democratic polity makes an obvious sense . If we are to cooperate with one another in such a setting , we need to be able to tie one another to agreements freely made , while we respect the privacy of each other 's inner lives and aspirations . A liberal society attempts to combine mutual respect for each other as moral agents with a common readiness to enforce ( and accept the enforcement of ) the obligations we owe one another as citizens and cooperators with each other . I am deliberately writing about the moral character of a whole society rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his account of justice with the contractualist theories of political obligation that sprang up in the seventeenth century ; Rawls is not interested in the question , " On what basis do I owe obedience to this government ? " It is not on the basis of any contract between ourselves and our rulers that Rawls supposed that we owed obedience . The obligation to obey our government  --  like the obligation on appropriate occasions to disobey it  --  stems from our ties to one another , not to government . This is surely the proper liberal conception of the matter ; there is a web of quasicontractual agreements and expectations that tie the citizenry sufficiently together to sustain their life as one people and one political community , and we owe it to one another to preserve the institutions that preserve that web . <p> This is the bare beginnings of the argument . I can not tackle here such obvious problems as the discrepancy between what one might call the " commonsense " view of such matters and this theoretical sophistication of the concept of political obligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children pledge allegiance " to the flag of the United States , " rather than , as you might say , " to each other , " and only " in respect of the flag . What is now needed is a brief sketch of the difference between a conversational or " dialogical " account of such a society and the contractarian account . The obvious difference is that a contractarian account in essence detaches the political from the moral realm . To that extent , Rawls exaggerates the difference between A Theory of Justice and Political Liberalism ; the later book was implicit in the earlier . It is the expression of liberal ideals that leads him to insist on that detachment ; and it is a combination of historical wisdom and philosophical scepticism ( and perhaps political optimism ) that lead to the thought that ideals are irreducibly many , but that their adherents can not merely coexist , but exist on mutually respectful terms . If adherents to other ideals can subscribe for the right reasons to a liberal democratic regime without discomfort , then we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal ideals . <p> The conversational view blurs the distinction between the moral and the political , perhaps because of a recognition that what is to count as " politics " is itself something to talk about . Theorists who think of politics as essentially the realm of coercive regulation have stronger motives for separating morals and politics than theorists who think of politics as the process by which we come to a common view about the society we wish to live in . Either view may be expressed as a concern with constitutional and legal arrangements or a concern for a particular political culture . Rousseau 's insistence that mores mattered more than law was coupled to an illiberal enthusiasm for Roman virtue ; but Tocqueville emphasized les moeurs as strenuously as Rousseau and thought good morals the foundation of liberty . In general , however , it seems true that the more we are attracted by the Arendtian view that politics is a creative rather than a regulative enterprise , the less we shall focus on coercion and the more we shall focus on the social and cultural conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to a second thought . Rawls 's contractualist account of a liberal social order presupposes that a society will have no aim of its own . It is rather the shelter for the projects of the people who coinhabit it . One might say that its one project is to shelter them on just terms , but it can not be a complaint against it that it has no mission civilisatrice of its own . There may be things it must attend to so that it can be a just society ; there are certainly ways everyone must behave if they are all to be treated justly  --  we can not rob each other , abuse each other , exploit each other , or even shout one another down . What we can not require of one another is allegiance to any particular ideal morality , not even the liberal ideal morality that tells us that this way of conducting social life is the one to pursue . <p> One of the most interesting puzzles in Habermas 's work is the sense in which he thinks there is a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " project of modernity " sounds like a common project ; but to the extent that it is a recasting of the Kantian project of bringing us to the state of mental and moral independence that allows us to coexist as citizens of a liberal and republican order , it is dubiously " common . " Do we have a common interest in , or concern with , emancipation , and then perhaps no further common concern ? The old Marxian hankering after a society in which the free development of all was the condition for the free development of each might be said to raise the same puzzle . Should we all subscribe to the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist order so that on the morrow , we can associate for our own individual ends ? Perhaps so , so long as we also find in every one else 's ends , not so much a constraint on how we may pursue our own ambitions , but projects whose fulfillment we also wish for . Would that be a society with common goals or not ? For the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it focuses on the question of what common culture must provide a soil in which liberalism can take root . Yet , it is bard not to think that the image of our social and political life as a conversation among equals offers an opening for Utopian speculation that contractarian ideas  --  at any rate in their chaste modern form  --  tend to close . II <p> Among the ideal images of a liberal society that lately have been current , that of " deliberative democracy " bas been prominent . Here I want to say some mildly unkind things about the idea of deliberative democracy , but only after saying one or two kinder things . Nobody who thought of herself as a democrat would be happy with the offer of a society in which governments were chosen by a scrupulously conducted election every five years , in between which times the government so chosen governed with no attention whatever to the wishes and wants of the people . ( I do not mean this to be a joke at the expense of the parliamentary dictatorship with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such . ) Behind or beneath the trappings of election , there must be a set of social arrangements that give the election an appropriate meaning . If there were no public discussion of issues , no informed press , no access to governing officials by formal and less formal channels , we would not call the result a democracy . One might enshrine the thought as holding that political democracy is a sham unless it is embedded in a society in which deliberation on public affairs is part of the woof and warp of everyday life . This was one of the things that Mill insisted on when defending democracy against Carlyle , and one of the things that Dewey bad in mind when describing democracy as a system of full communication . <p> Again , it would not be much of a democracy in which the majority hogged all elective office and then used its power to deprive the minority of access to jobs , housing , decent schooling and the other amenities of life . The condition of Northern Ireland was for many years not unlike this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through perfectly fair and above-board elections  --  given the demography of the province of Ulster , there was no need to rig elections  --  and then employing that power to exclude the Catholic minority from a fair share of the usual benefits of a civilized society . Unlike most colonial societies , in which a small white minority suppresses the aspirations of a large nonwhite majority , Northern Ireland demonstrated what could happen when a cohesive majority governs with no concerns for the welfare of an equally cohesive minority . Some of the weaknesses of the idea of deliberative democracy as well as it strengths show up in this example . One might say that deliberation was not what was required to remedy this state of affairs so much as a willingness on the part of those with power to attend to arguments about the injustice of their use of it that would make the necessary difference . If fair enough , this point still concedes that deliberation on the merits would reveal the unfairness of the ruling majority 's behavior . Still , for the moment all I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for electing governments does not create democratic legitimacy unless political democracy is operated in a fair , open , and equal fashion . <p> That constraint is just what the Habermasian insistence on a dialogical understanding of social decision-making provides . Habermas 's theory of communicative action can hardly be said to " boil down " to any one thing , but certainly one of his more attractive insights is the suggestion that fair , open , and equal discussion is implied by the bare idea of our endeavoring to talk to one another at all . If anything is a demand of reason , it is a demand of reason that everyone can join in the discussion , that everyone is given a bearing , that no views are protected by appeals to authority . Thus one can see how an emphasis on the dialogical , or on the role of deliberation , appears to bring with it an emphasis on the background conditions that provide democratic legitimacy to a formal democracy . <p> Still , there is also much to be said against equating a deliberative polity with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notable feature of the regime 's operation , and some of those have been democratic polities . If we think of the most deliberative of all , namely classical Athens , it was a society in which there was no requirement that the people should listen carefully and decide impartially . Consider the habit of ostracism . This was a very pure expression of the democratic spirit . It was not the expression of a liberal emphasis on individual rights , nor of a concern to hear all sides of a case . It was the expression of an egalitarian sense that if the public would rather Aristides went away for ten years , then away he must go . It might be an act of ingratitude , or silliness , or any other thing one cares to name ; but it was an emblematic act as well . What it announced to all the world was that no matter who you were , you could be sent away by the ordinary people of the city if they decided they did not want you in their city . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ancient societies were more brutal than that . Nonetheless , what it expressed was a perfectly intelligible conception of democracy , and one that was not in essence a deliberative conception . <p> So I come to the unkind thought . To discuss deliberative democracy as though it is a perfectly good interpretation of what democracy is all about is an injustice to the history of democracy , and to the history of political thinking . If one asks what the great virtue of democracy is , the most plausible answer is that it allows the poor many to make the few rich behave themselves . The few rich will in general be adept in discussion , will find it easy to pay for allies , and have an unfair advantage in most areas of social life . They will , unless held in check , exploit the downtrodden many , and may well engage in all sorts of dangerous and wicked political antics to gratify their sense of pride , honor , or vanity . On all of this , Machiavelli , Hobbes and Rousseau had many sensible things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but absolute monarchy would keep the fluent upper classes in check . Machiavelli , on the other hand , observed that these vices can be turned to good under the right conditions ; leadership is always in short supply , courage is not something the ordinary man possesses in the absence of good leadership , and political intelligence is no more widely distributed than most other forms of intelligence . So , a not particularly democratic form of popular government may be the best way to shape the talents of the better off to useful , public spirited ends . All the same , as Machiavelli 's discussion of the conflict between the plebeians and the patricians concluded , it was only the ability of the lower orders to keep the better off in check that allowed Rome to preserve her liberties . <p> In the modern world , the same lessons apply . Family honor is a less potent force for trouble today than in the Athens of the Peloponnesian War , but the pros and cons of democracy are not very different . The people may be had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is their ability to hold the ruling elites to account that may diminish exploitation , greed , and the grosser sorts of injustice . Conversely , the British parliament of the eighteenth century was anything but democratic . Members of the House of Commons were often sons or cousins of members of the House of Lords ; other members bought their seats shamelessly , or charmed their way into the good graces of aristocratic families through whose patronage they hoped to rise . " None of this damned merit about it , " as the Duke of Wellington observed many years later . Nonetheless , it was genuinely a deliberative assembly ; it was what Carlyle dismissed and Mill acclaimed as a " talking shop . " In the eighteenth century , governments might , and did , fall as the result of losing arguments in the talking shop , and this remained substantially true until the rise of disciplined modern political parties at the end of the nineteenth century . <p> In the nineteenth century ; when reformers such as Gladstone were anxious to bring the working man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that could safely be done , it was feared that there was an inescapable conflict between good deliberation and equal representation . To put it another way , if the art of parliamentary government is to govern the country by means of continuous conversation  --  inside the cabinet , between ministers and the country , by the medium of the set-piece debate in parliament , and between members of the political class inside and outside parliament  --  good conversations seem to require people who know one another , and whose habits of thought , inclinations toward peace and war , to economical or extravagant government , and to much else besides , were well known to each other . However much one valued the rights of man , one might well fear that a new class of politician would not know how to carry on the conversation . <p> If one were to wonder why radicals seemed not to feel the force of these anxieties , two answers present themselves immediately . The first is that anyone who wanted greater democracy in order to curb the greed and arrogance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of " Stop it ! " from the citizenry . A second , however , is that radical reformers of the late-eighteenth century such as Thomas Paine or William Godwin , thought that once government was reformed it would all but go out of business . Godwin was a principled anarchist , but Paine commonly argued as though government mostly sought ways of lining the pockets of the upper classes . Absent the upper classes , there would be fewer wars , smaller armies , less crime , therefore lower taxes , and an altogether smaller machine to support . Conversely , later in the nineteenth century , when Walter Bagehot wrote The English Constitution to praise the last days of the mid-century political settlement , it was exactly that ability to run a deliberative system whose rules were largely implicit that Bagehot feared might be lost . Bagehot saw the logic of Mill 's Considerations on Representative Government , but did not think that logic was the virtue politics most needed . The skills required of the politicians Bagehot admired were not intellectual but moral and social ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who lacked them simply could not . <p> If that is right , deliberativeness as a quality of a political regime may have rather little to do with its democratic qualities . That deliberation in some sense is a good thing is rather hard to doubt ; there is not much in modern politics that is best accomplished by barging ahead thoughtlessly . On the other hand , there is much that has been done with a great deal of deliberation that has not benefited from it . The Vietnam War was the most thoughtfully conducted war in human history , until soldiers reached the battlefield . Its politics were deliberated at great length , though not among all the affected parties  --  including therein the population of South Vietnam , whose interest in what happened was greater than anyone 's . So a proper interpretation of the goals of deliberative democracy presumably must be the thought that democracy , properly speaking , must be a matter of operating whatever electoral and other formal arrangements we do operate in such a way that the relations between rulers and ruled approximates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are generally seen to be the public 's problems . <p> As that last phrase suggests , there is a famous ancestor to this thought . Dewey 's The Public and Its Problems provided some seventy years ago a picture  --  as blurred and suggestive as most of the pictures of a democratic society that Dewey painted  --  of a national community that could resolve the issues that confronted it by intelligent processes of discussion . In the hands of its more recent protagonists , the idea applies particularly in situations where we have bureaucratic mechanisms for formulating and implementing policy . The underlying thought is Deweyan rather than Bagehotian  --  that is , the concern is with the sensible and morally acceptable management of the common problems of modern society rather than the high politics of Victorian England . The Deweyan thought I 'd like to extract from the idea of deliberative democracy amounts to the suggestion that what deliberation can sometimes do is get beyond the rationality embodied in syllogistic or deductive argument . Ordinarily , we think that political principles lie behind the policies that implement them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral values it is supposed to realize , and its success or failure in doing so . This suggests that a consensus on policy springs from a consensus on principles ; but often we are at odds about principles when we are not at odds about policy . Often , too , we agree on principles , but on principles that conflict with one another , and so do not know quite what policy best implements them . And often , we suffer from the problem that the standard textbook obsession suggests we always suffer from ; some of us think that the world revolves around one set of principles and some of us think it revolves around another set . <p> The recent enthusiasm for deliberative  --  or " conversational "  --  democracy picks up from this point . We find that enthusiasts for individual rights will hold different views about policy from enthusiasts for a broadly utilitarian vision of things , that those devoted to retributive justice will hold different views on penal policy from those devoted to rehabilitation , and so on . The thought is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , this seems entirely implausible , since if there is a head-on conflict between , say , rights and utility , or between a retributivist and a reformative view of punishment , then what there is is a head-on conflict between rights and utility , and it will not vanish by being talked about . Yet an evasively Deweyan approach may make sense even here . Suppose we believe that principles are not the freestanding dictates of reason , but abridgements of our habits of moral decision-making . Talking things out with each other will clarify our commitments , but may also change them in subtle and , if we are lucky , fruitful ways . " Intelligent action , " as Dewey baptized it , was not a matter of reasoning syllogistically from irresistible premises , but a matter of advancing productively from one agreed stopping place to another . <p> The model was that of a scientific community exploring the natural world with the aid of its best theoretical understanding . In Habermasian terms , our understanding of the natural world is " monological , " because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is , of course , neither here nor there in the present context , since we are not discussing the way in which we relate to nature but the way we relate to one another in respect of the common project of understanding the natural world . Essentially , what is being said here is simply that the model of achieving a consensus on the way the natural world works can be applied to illuminate the working of a democratic polity , and that just as we might want to see scientific theories as the best understanding that a community ' of inquirers can achieve by unconstrained dialogue , so we might wish to understand good policy-making in terms of collective problem-solving on the same basis . III <p> Lastly , then , a very few observations about the present popularity of the idea that philosophical inquiry , too , is best understood " conversationally . " The old image of philosophy as a form of quasi-science , the image that dominates the work of Bertrand Russell , for instance , bas fallen into disrepute in most circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of political thought that has abandoned the old confidence that " we " see more clearly and see more deeply than our forebears . ( I do not mean to deny that some " contextualist " accounts of political theory praise the present even when trying not to do so , by taking it so thoroughly for granted that our relativist and contextualist grasp of what our forbears were doing is plainly right and their absolutist self-understanding plainly wrong . ) The greater the plausibility of the thought that successive ages and cultures will have their own worldviews and their own intellectual apparatus , with which they will resolve their own problems and quell their own anxieties , the more likely we shall be to see interpretation as a form of conversation across the ages and cultures . Once we go down that track , we shall be readier to see the task of philosophy in our own time as that of preserving a certain sort of conversation about the major cultural issues of the day . <p> Given that movement , which is a movement of sensibility as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three small things one might want to say . The first is to acknowledge the duplicity of the idea that the history of ideas is " conversational . " I have admired for forty years the work of Isaiah Berlin , just because the vivid writing , and the depth of personal moral engagement , that characterize everything he wrote give one the sensation of being brought directly and immediately into the physical presence of the persons about whom he wrote . The experience of reading Berlin is very like the experience of being suddenly thrust into a brightly lit room , full of people arguing , and having to formulate some question , comment , or observation of our own . The sensation having gone away , we must admit that one of the pleasures of the experience is exactly that we know full well that there is not a real conversation taking place . It is not that we do not care whether Berlin 's " Machiavelli " is the Machiavelli  --  or Belinsky , Herzen , Moses Hess , or whomever  --  but we do know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike a real conversational encounter . <p> The Machiavelli that Berlin asks us to talk to is not going to walk away , change the subject , or act in deeply unpredictable ways . The reason is simple enough ; he is an imaginative reconstruction , not a person . The " invisible college " to which all ( or only the major ? ) political theorists are said to belong is not a real college , only one that is less obtrusive to the eye than most ; it is no college at all . Since this is obvious , and the point would be hardly worth making , if that was all there was to it , the question arises of what the idiom is expressing . I suggest it is two things above all . The first is as much negative as positive , though none the worse for it . We are as interpreters not to obtrude ourselves too fiercely ; we are not be " pushy " in our interpretation , not to write as though there can be no question of the superiority of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whom we are writing . We are to engage passionately but passively , to do what we can to let the texts speak for themselves and through us . Does this demand duplicity ? Perhaps a little ; it demands a sort of attentive suspension of attention to our own presence in the discussion . Stuart Hampshire 's literary reviews of three decades ago possessed this quality ; writing about Henry-James , he was not Jamesian , but exhibited a Jamesian sensibility , and writing about Painter 's biography of Proust , he achieved a sinuosity and subtlety that was not Proustian pastiche , but was wonderfully evocative of Proust 's own prose . Good conversationalists do this for their real-life interlocutors ; to do something like it in textual interpretation demands the same skills . <p> The other thought is also one that requires some willingness to head in opposite directions at once . Conversation occurs in the here and now . In the nature of the case , writing about our dead cultural acquaintances requires one party to be somewhere else than the here and now . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here and now , but without mere , grinding anachronism . The obvious difficulty is that there can be no way of being sure that we have brought off the trick . The irrecoverable past is truly irrecoverable . But the fear induced by that thought can be somewhat assuaged by considering that everyday conversation raises similar problems ; do either of us know quite what we meant when we said x ? Is our post-mortem reconstruction reliable , or is it a new attempt to carry on the conversation in our own heads and without the awkward presence of another person ? <p> Returning to where I began , I do not pretend to have shown that there is some single insight at the heart of the recent popularity of the conversational idiom in the human sciences . Nonetheless , there is something in common to these various employments . It is this : the claims of reason have often been thought of as imperial , or monarchical  --  the " dictates of reason " is a familiar idiom . This suggests a political model adapted to the philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see ourselves as uttering a timelessly accurate account of what others have dimly glimpsed  --  however painfully we know that we shall be overtaken by our successors . If we fully believe that even if our habits of speech suggest an allegiance to these rationalist and imperial standards , we can not in fact accept them , we will wish not to be trapped by our idioms . Whence the insistence that what we say is to be heard , if not read , as one voice in a conversation : a thought that should itself be read on a rising intonation . <p> By Alan Ryan <p>
