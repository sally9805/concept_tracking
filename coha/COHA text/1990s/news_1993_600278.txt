<p> South Korean automaker Hyundai , on the ropes just last year , is bouncing back . <p> Spurred by better-quality cars , free maintenance , big rebates and a return to the " cars that make sense " ad pitch , Hyundai 's ' 93 sales are 13% ahead of last year 's . The auto industry is up 8% . <p> In fact , Hyundai has big plans to improve not only its share of the U.S. market but to expand production in Korea and become one of the world 's 10 biggest automakers by decade 's end . Its production of some 860,000 cars last year ranked it 14th . <p> If the U.S. turnaround sticks , it will amount to the second coming of Hyundai . <p> In 1986 , the unknown car company blasted into the USA after a warm-up stint selling small cars in Canada . Hyundai Motor America , based in southern California , offered the automotive equivalent of a good five-cent cigar - the $ 4,995 Excel subcompact . Like that nickel stogie , Excel was just what the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excels , its only model then . Sales peaked at 264,000 in 1988 - the fastest start ever for an import brand in the USA . <p> Then Hyundai owners had problems with automatic transmissions , brakes and body trim . And unsettled Hyundai workers in Korea halted the assembly lines repeatedly , hurting shipments and quality . The brand 's reputation sank . Some non-Hyundai dealers refused to take a Hyundai as a trade-in . And thousands of entry-level shoppers , those likely to buy Hyundais , lost jobs in the 1990-91 recession . <p> Hyundai 's U.S. sales fell to fewer than 109,000 cars last year . That would be bad enough if it were just Excel sales . But it was for four models . Excel , its biggest seller , now priced from $ 6,799 , sold only 42,000 cars . General Motors killed the Pontiac Fiero when sales sunk that low . <p> Chief Operating Officer Douglas Mazza says he expects sales this year of 110,000 . Despite the early-year sales spurt , Hyundai ca n't expect to instantly reverse a bad reputation , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved enough to erase bad memories . <p> " If you have n't driven a ' 93 Hyundai , all you know is history , " he says . Mazza says Hyundai is doing a better job telling consumers it has an array of models , not just a bare-bones subcompact . And it is converting 70% of browsers into buyers , according to a 1992 Hyundai study . <p> To calm dealers , Mazza just finished a three-week tour . At 18 regional meetings , he met with nearly every one of Hyundai 's 500 dealers . <p> " They want to know what the plan is and if there is a plan . They 've invested a lot in Hyundai , and we owe them that , " Mazza says . " Plus , I 'm the new COO , and they want to know , ' Who is this guy ? ' " <p> Mazza is Hyundai 's fifth COO since ' 86 . <p> In chalk talks with dealers , Mazza sketches his marketing plan as concentric circles . In the center are those already buying Hyundais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisters : " They 've heard our message but for some reason do n't buy . " Those are the immediate target . <p> Mazza says he thinks that group is bigger than the one buying Hyundais so it is worth courting . He thinks resisters shun Hyundai because they see themselves as too wealthy or have heard bad stories . <p> " If ( auto-quality researcher J.D. ) Power suddenly comes out and says Hyundai is the only car to buy , their resistance would collapse , " he says . <p> The third circle is hard resisters , those who might buy a Hyundai if they needed inexpensive , free-maintenance cars for college-bound children and did n't have to park them in their own driveways . <p> The outer circle is " people who want nothing to do with Hyundai , " Mazza says . <p> Hyundai begins image-building ads this month to entice the resisters . " You 'll see we 're talking to a different group , discussing our company and our value , " Mazza says . <p> Beyond that , Hyundai plans to overhaul all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The company also sees other factors working for it : <p> - Stable currency . The Korean won tends to rise or fall with the dollar . That allows Hyundai to keep its U.S. car prices stable , while the strengthening Japanese yen drives up prices of rival small cars . <p> - Improving quality . Hyundai says it upgraded how it builds cars in Ulsan , South Korea , and has set a goal to match or exceed the efficiency of Toyota 's production system . Hyundai consistently finishes worse-than-average in J.D. Power 's product-quality surveys . But scores have been improving . <p> - Generating excitement . Two wild concept cars , called HCD I and HCD II , have impressed critics and crowds at auto shows for two years . HCD II is intended to replace the Scoupe sporty coupe in the 1997 model year . " That will be a good image car , " says J.D. Power analyst Tom Dukes . " If they can stay in the $ 15,000 price range that they 've announced , that will be a dynamite vehicle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year to jazz up its dowdy identity . A Scoupe Turbo won its class at the 1992 Pike 's Peak hill climb , beating such contenders as Chevrolet Camaro and Nissan 300ZX . " Racing shows off Hyundai in a different light . That 's the kind of thing we need to change the image , " Mazza says . <p> - Listening more carefully to U.S. managers , dealers , planners and designers . For instance , its chief U.S. executive , Dal Ok Chung , does n't like the cost of the company 's Value Care plan , which offers two years ' free maintenance . But he left it alone because dealers said it helps close sales . And Hyundai is expanding its southern California design center , responsible for the HCD show cars , so that four new models can be designed simultaneously instead of two . <p> Eyeing the new approach , industry consultant George Peterson of AutoPacific Group , says : " It really looks as if Hyundai has bottomed out and now has its act pretty well together . " <p> Overhauling U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - 1994 Sonata midsize sedan goes on sale the first quarter of next year . It is what the auto industry calls " all new , " meaning it has a new platform and hardware underneath , plus different sheet metal outside . It will have dual air bags . Anti-lock brakes will be available on more versions . Air conditioning will feature refrigerant that does not contain ozone-threatening chloroflourocarbons , CFCs . <p> - Convertible version of Scoupe is mulled for ' 94 . <p> - 1995 Excel small car should be on sale by late ' 94 . It will feature new styling , Hyundai 's advanced Alpha four-cylinder engine , dual air bags and CFC-free air conditioning . <p> - 1996 Elantra subcompact , Hyundai 's midlevel car , will be re-styled . <p> - HCD II show car , or a close likeness , is to replace Scoupe in the ' 97 model year . HCD uses the Hyundai Alpha engine and could have unusual side-facing rear seat , making it a three-passenger car .
