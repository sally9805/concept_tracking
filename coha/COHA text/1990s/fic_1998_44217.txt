Technically , Vivian was looking at me as she groped around under the passenger 's seat , but really her head just happened to be pointed in my direction , her right cheek smashed against the glove compartment . We were driving through Wyoming . I smiled at her . She said , " Where the hell could that damn thing have gotten to ? " This . was my first time crossing the country by car-by van , actually-and I was stunned by the emptiness of the terrain . Hours and hours of driving surrounded by the same ugly barren rock and dirt as far I could see . Vivian was a West-head . The West this , the West that , the West was God 's splendid paradise on Earth . She had lived in Montana all her life before her job transferred her to Manhattan , which is where we met . Myself , I had never been out of New York . For me , upstate New York was untamed wilderness . Wyoming was . . . I do n't know . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you looking at , Jeeves ? " My name is Anthony , but Vivian had taken to calling me Jeeves because I insisted on doing all the driving . Jeeves was her name for all chauffeurs . " Never mind , " she said when I did n't answer quickly enough . " I can see what you 're looking at . " <p> I was looking at her breasts , of course . She had on a lightweight summer dress cut low and loose , and the way she was bent over , it would have taken a saint not to stare . When I reached down to touch the objects of my gaze , Vivian pulled away , sat up straight , crossed her arms over her breasts , and gave me one of her withering stares . <p> " Uh , oh , " I said . " Bad touch ? " <p> " Very good , Jeeves . " <p> In the two years we 'd been together , Vivian had been working hard to teach me the difference between good touch and bad touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened when she wanted to be touched , when she gave me the right signals . Bad touch was , like , if she was preparing dinner and I happened to notice her ass as she stood with her back to me and I put my hand between her legs . That was bad touch . It usually resulted in the withering stare . Problem was , it was n't always so damn obvious . And Lord help me if I did n't touch her when she wanted to be touched . That meant I did n't love her . I sighed . <p> " I did n't realize you did n't want to be touched , I said . " Forgive me . " <p> " You did n't realize ? " She looked hard at me and then sighed . <p> As a couple , we tended to sigh a lot . <p> " Forgive me , " I repeated . " But this was planned as a romantic trip , remember ? I mean , the plan was , romance . " <p> " Sure it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get you out of Manhattan . " <p> " Oh ? So it was a deception ? The promise of sex was a subterfuge to get me out of Manhattan ? " <p> " Right . It was a deception , Anthony . I got a yeast infection so I would n't have to have sex with you on a trip I spent the whole year planning . " <p> Her point was irrefutable . My aggressive attitude dissolved . <p> " Anthony , " Vivian said . " Why are you such an asshole ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Vivian . Forgive me for touching my fiancee when I notice her breasts . Forgive me for thinking she might actually want to be touched . " <p> " Anthony . Please . I was scrunched up against the dashboard looking for the cap to a tube of vaginal cream , and you thought I might want to be touched ? What is wrong with you , Jeeves ? " <p> " There 's nothing wrong with me , " I said . Then added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What 's wrong- " Vivian reached into the litter bag at her feet and pulled out the tube of cream with the missing cap , which was really less a tube and more a perverse cross between a tube , a syringe , and a push-up pop . She pulled back the plunger and held the device dangling from her fingertips . " Do you know what I had to do with this thing , Jeeves ? " <p> " I can make a guess . " <p> " That 's right , " Vivian said . " Exactly . " <p> " And so ? " I said . " Is it my fault ? " <p> " Yes . It is . It 's your fault , Jeeves . " <p> " It 's my fault ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> I pondered this . How was it my fault that Vivian had a yeast infection ? Because of work and trips and scheduling , we had n't had sex in over two months . For a moment I was nonplussed . Then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an argument-she had explained this to me many times-it meant she was feeling vulnerable and needed to be reassured . She recommended gentle , loving touch and kind words . I reached across the seat and held her hand . " Vivian , " I said . " I love you very much . I think you 're beautiful . " <p> She was silent a moment . Outside , the same relentless ragged rocks floated by unending . " Sure , " she said , subdued . " Now , when I 'm twenty-five , you think I 'm beautiful . What are you going to think when I 'm forty-five and look like a stereotypical Italian grandmother ? " <p> " Are you worrying about the wedding ? " The wedding was planned for Labor Day weekend . It was still a couple of months away . " I 'm not , " she said . <p> " Then what are you worrying about ? " <p> " I 'm worrying about how I 'll look when I 'm forty-five . " <p> Vivian was small , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She derided it as a weight-lifter 's body . I liked her looks . I liked her body . I liked her body a lot . Still , as she had told me often , it was not the body she would have chosen had someone thought to ask her . I said , " I find you very attractive , Vivian . " <p> " Oh , " she said . " Attractive . " <p> " Beautiful , " I said . " I said beautiful first . " <p> " And when I 'm forty-five ? " <p> " When you 're forty-five , I 'll be fifty . " <p> " So ? " Suddenly she was angry again . " Mr. Sickkens-was there ever a more perfect name ? - Sickkens just turned fifty-four . " <p> Mr. Sickkens was her boss . He 'd recently left his wife of twenty-plus years to marry the company CEO , who was only thirty-something . <p> " Sickkens does n't look fifty-four . " I said . " No way . " <p> " You wo n't look your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men never do ! " <p> " But I will , " I said . " I promise . I promise to age gracelessly . By the time I 'm fifty , I 'll look like shit . I swear . " <p> " You promise ? " She seemed placated . I detected the hint of a smile . <p> " Absolutely . " I pulled her close to me and put my arm around her . She kissed me on the cheek . <p> For the next several minutes , we drove on like that , in silence , harmoniously . Outside the car , the scenery sailed past , impossibly unchanging . I was amazed , really . I found it hard to believe America still had such huge , empty places . I had flown over the country many times . From the air , you just see this big flat space that turns into mountains for a while , and then you 're in Los Angeles . Amazing how different it was on the ground . Hour after hour after hour of driving and nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see , no matter where you look . It was beginning to make me seriously anxious . I wanted to complain about the landscape again , but I knew better . Vivian had a proprietary attitude toward the West , and every time I complained , which I had been doing with some frequency the past two days , she took it as a personal insult . <p> I could n't keep myself from commenting . I tried not to sound negative . " It 's just . . . stunning , " I said . " The emptiness of it . " Vivian sighed . " It 's not empty , " she said . " It 's just not overdeveloped , like the entire East Coast . " <p> " Not over-developed ? That 's like saying the surface of the sun is not unpleasantly chilly . " <p> " Do n't start , " Vivian said . " It 's not empty . It 's capacious . " " Capacious , " I repeated , hoping she 'd tell me what the word meant before I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capacious was one of those reading words , words that turn up in writing but hardly ever in real speech . Like lugubrious , or effluvium . I could recall having read it and looked it up before , but I could n't recall what it meant . Vivian had used it only because it was one of last week 's words-of-the-day , which , itself , was a mystery to me-the whole word-a-day thing . Vivian 's vocabulary was excellent , but , suddenlythis started like a week after I proposed to her-she has to improve her vocabulary . Every day 's a new word , which she gets out of a vocabulary book she hauls around . This morning 's word had been cinereous , which means consisting of or resembling ashes , a gray color tinged with black . All morning it was Look at that cinereous cloud , and Look at that cinereous patch of ground . Once she even used it metaphorically , claiming she was in a cinereous mood . I advised her against that one . I had some authority in the area since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a writer for The Today Show . <p> " That 's right , " Vivian said . " Capacious . " <p> " Okay . I ca n't remember what it means . Tell me . " <p> " Roomy , " Vivian said , happily . " Spacious . Large enough to contain great quantities of things . " <p> " That 's right , " I said . " I knew but I forgot . " <p> " Right , " she said . <p> " Okay , fine , " I said . " I did n't know . " I looked down at the dash board clock . It was nearing eight in the evening . " We 've been driving twelve hours , " I said . " If I close my eyes , I see the same things I see when they 're open . " <p> " You 've been driving twelve hours . If you 'd share the driving , Jeeves , it 'd be a lot easier on you . " <p> I let my body go loose as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument a dozen times in two days . I was terrifically uncomfortable in a car if I was n't driving . The tension was just unbearable . I constantly watched the road and listened to my heart race . I explained this again and again , but Viv insisted on seeing it as a power issue , a male-female thing , like it was some sort of macho posturing not to let the woman drive . That was n't it at all . Well , maybe there was a touch of that-my father never even let my mother get a driver 's license-but mostly I was just scared when somebody else was driving . Anybody else . I said , " Please do n't start , Viv . Just . . . Are we stopping tonight or what ? " <p> Vivian sat up and peered out the window , as if she might be able to see something I could n't . " I thought we 'd be there by now , " she said . " I made a reservation at Little America . " <p> " Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Wait and see . " Then she said , " Anthony , " in a long drawn out whine , which I recognized as meaning Anthony , I have a problem and I need to talk to you about it and I need you to be understanding and loving . <p> " What ? " <p> " Anthony , " she said . " I 'm worried about tonight . I 've been worried since this morning . " <p> I had no idea what she was talking about , which was n't unusual . " Why ? What 's the problem ? " <p> " Why ? " she said . " Do you know how long it 's been since we 've had sex ? " <p> " About two months , " I said . " I 'm keenly aware . " <p> " Nine weeks , " she said . " That 's like a lifetime , Anthony . I feel like a virgin again . I spent all year building this trip up as a sex holiday ; then I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling with a nun ; and now , we can finally have sex , and- " <p> " We can have sex ? " <p> " I 'm fine today . " <p> I speeded up a bit . <p> Vivian said , " Do you see my point ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " Anthony , " she said . " You 're so dense . I wanted this to be a romantic trip , and now we 've both been waiting and waiting and I feel like I promised you the Kamasutra or something . I mean , we ca n't just have ordinary sex after all this build up . After all this , I feel like I need to reveal a secret sex organ or some exotic trick you 've never dreamed of . I mean , I feel like I need to do the Dance of Seven Veils or something . " <p> " Do n't be silly , " I said . <p> " Good , " she barked . " Dismiss my anxieties . That 'll help a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , be quiet , Anthony . You 're hopeless . " She hopped over the seat and into the back of the van , where we had a little traveling room set up . I heard the cot squeak as she climbed on and stretched out . " I 'm taking a nap , " she said . " Wake me when get to Little America . " <p> " How much longer is that going to be ? " <p> " I thought we 'd be there by now . Ca n't be another five or ten minutes . " <p> " How will I know when we 're there ? " <p> " You 'll know , " she said . " You ca n't miss it . Believe me . " <p> Three hours later , I made a right turn onto a dirt road that appeared to lead out into the desert . It was after eleven and I was beginning to feel as though the steering wheel were an extension of my body . Vivian sat alongside me with her knees pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen asleep a little after eight and I had pulled into a gas station shortly after that to ask how much longer to Little America . The gas station attendant said , " Little America ? About three hundred miles up the road . " I said , " Three hundred miles ? Are you sure ? " He did n't answer . He looked at me a moment as if I were a perplexing entity , and then he looked away . When Vivian finally woke and joined me up front , she would n't believe she had so miscalculated the distance to Little America . She snatched the maps from the glove compartment to see for herself . By eleven o'clock we started looking for somewhere to pull off the road so I could sleep a while , and a little after that this dirt road appeared . It did n't look as if it could possibly go anywhere . <p> Maybe an eighth of a mile off the main road , we found what looked to be an abandoned mine . I parked the van next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was dying to stretch , which was the first thing I did as soon as my feet hit the ground . I lifted my hands up high over my head and bent over backwards . Joints cracked and popped along my spine and neck . When I straightened up and looked around , I was struck by the stillness of the place . The quiet was amazing . I had never heard such quiet . I must have just stood there motionless for more than a minute , staring out across an endless , rocky plain that looked like the pictures that little robot sent back from the surface of Mars . I was waiting to hear a sound . Anything . I did n't . I did n't hear a damn thing , not even wind . There was n't any . Just . . . nothing , silence . I realized I had never heard such silence before . I tried to identify the feeling it evoked and decided it was . . . fear . There was something terrifying about such silence . I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " Vivian ? " I said , as much to hear myself speak as to get her attention . <p> Vivian had n't moved from the passenger 's seat . Her arms were crossed over the open window and she was looking up at the sky . I leaned against the driver 's door . " How come it 's so quiet ? " I said . <p> " Is n't it magnificent ? " she answered , the awe in her voice palpable . <p> I looked around , thinking perhaps I had missed something . I saw the same rocks and heard the same silence . With the exception of the boarded up mine entrance some twenty feet or so in front of us , this place was the definition of nothing . No sounds . No things . Just dirt , rock , and silence . " If you say so . " <p> She turned around to look at me . " You do n't think it 's magnificent ? " she said . She sounded disappointed in me . " Do n't you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to answer . " Should n't there be some sounds ? " I asked . " Like , animals scurrying or something ? I mean it 's just so quiet it 's weird . It 's not natural . " <p> " There are sounds , " she said . " You just ca n't hear them yet . " <p> " What are you , Carlos Castanedas now ? " She laughed . Apparently she was in a magnanimous mood . " Did n't you say you wanted to sleep a while ? " <p> " I have to piss first . " I looked behind me . The boulder beside the van must have been a good five feet high . I considered walking around to piss on the other side of it . " You sure it 's safe out here ? " I said . " I mean , there are n't like grizzly bears or tarantulas or anything , right ? " <p> " No grizzly bears in the Wyoming desert , " she said . " Might be tarantulas . Long as you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . " <p> " My thing , " I said . I walked around to the other side of the boulder and peed , being careful to keep my thing a good distance back from the rock , lest something should leap up on it . I was definitely jumpy . It was the silence and expanse of the sky , which seemed to press down on me . Even the stars seemed too bright and too numerous . <p> " Hey , Vivian , " I called , my eyes fixed on the powdery surface of the rock . " Maybe we should forget the nap and just keep going till we get to this Little America place . " <p> On the other side of the boulder , the back door of the van popped open . It was a hatchback and it opened up like a mouth . " You need to sleep a bit , " Vivian said , from the back of the van . " Unless you want to let me drive , of course . " <p> I made a face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I thought , " she said . <p> I was getting bored watching a little river form near my feet . " What 's with this Little America ? " I said . " What kind of name is that for a motel ? " <p> " It 's not a motel , " her voice came back . " It 's more a resort : green grass and neat little clean buildings . . . you know , like idealized , hometown America , only it 's stuck in the middle of the desert . " <p> " Green ? " I said . " Grass ? " I was suddenly enthusiastic . I realized that I had n't seen anything green in days . <p> " I knew you 'd love it , " she said . " Just do n't ask how much water they have to waste to grow lawns in the desert . " <p> I had n't planned on asking . It did n't seem like a waste to me . I zipped up and walked around the boulder thinking about grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I reached the back of the van , however , my thoughts shifted quickly . Vivian was stretched out naked on the cot . In the desert moonlight , the hidden flesh of her body , ordinarily pale white , even pinkish , appeared dark and exotic . Her nipples , reddish under the light of lamps and ceiling fixtures , were darker , a deep maroon or brown . She was smiling just slightly , and her eyes were full of playful invitation . I sat on the bumper and had my clothes off in seconds , and a few minutes later , we were making love . The little cot creaked and the van shook . Then , at the sweetest , deepest moment of penetration , I felt something bite me where it should have been impossible to get bitten . I stopped moving abruptly . A bad joke about vaginas and teeth came to mind . In a husky voice , Vivian asked me if anything was wrong . I kissed her on the cheek . I pushed again and there it was again , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jerked back quickly . I came out of her and looked down , and it took me a good several seconds of staring to realize what I was looking at . " Vivian , " I said . " I found that blue cap that was missing . " <p> Vivian jumped up into a sitting position and looked for herself . " What have you done ? " she said . " What the hell is that ? " <p> The previously missing blue cap was suctioned tight to the top of my penis , looking like a doll-size , cutsy Shriner 's hat worn jauntily , a little off to one side . " I did n't do anything , " I said . " It must have been . . . in there . . . and when I . . . " <p> " Oh . . . " She appeared to be at a loss for words . I had a hard time reading her expression . I could n't tell whether she thought this was funny or tragic . " God , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at someplace foreign . " What else is in there ? " <p> I said , " It must have been from when you- " <p> " I know what happened , " she said . " I just ca n't believe . . . I mean , I did n't feel anything . I did n't think there was that much . . . room in there . " <p> " Me neither , " I said . " It must be downright . . . capacious . " Vivian looked at me a moment as if I might be dangerous . I gathered she did n't think I was very funny . <p> " Viv . . " I touched her shoulder . <p> She kept staring at me . Her face seemed to be collapsing . Her eyes grew teary . " Anthony , " she said . " I do n't know about us getting married . " She slid down off the cot and out of the van . She walked casually to the boulder , as if she were fully dressed and strolling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walking to a rock in the desert . <p> I followed her-after gingerly removing the little man 's cap . It was odd . We were padding around the desert as if it were our bedroom . <p> " Can I have a moment of privacy , " she said when I tried to talk to her . <p> " Sure , " I said , and I waited on my side of the boulder . It struck me that this was a lot like the arguments we 'd have in my apartment , when she 'd go into the bathroom and I 'd have to talk to her through the closed door . <p> I touched a slick space on the boulder with a fingertip . The surface was smooth as skin . " Vivian , " I said . " What have I done ? " <p> " What have you done , " she repeated . " Do you know how this makes me feel ? " <p> " The cap thing ? It 's nothing . It 's funny . " <p> " The cap thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " You 're insensitive . " <p> " Oh , Vivian . . . Look . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to be insensitive . Truly . " <p> " First it 's the infection , " she said . " Then my cunt turns out to be a storage closet- " <p> I laughed . <p> " You think it 's funny ? " <p> I stopped laughing instantly . " That was n't supposed to be funny ? " She did n't answer , but I could feel the waves of anger right through the boulder . " Okay , " I said . " I 'm a jerk . I 'm sorry . " <p> " You 're an insensitive jerk . " <p> " Okay . An insensitive jerk . " <p> " It 's not just this , " she said . " The cap thing . It 's the past two days . It 's the West . " <p> " The West ? " <p> " Ever since we 've gotten to the real West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain . " <p> I turned around and leaned back against the boulder . I looked up at the endless expanse of sky . " I have n't done nothing but complain . " " Yes you have . Not only have you not been impressed , you act like you 're offended by the landscape , like you ca n't believe God had the gall to create such a place . " <p> " You 're exaggerating . " <p> " I am not . You 've been whining for two days . " <p> " What do you want from me , Vivian ? I 'm uncomfortable here . This is not my home . " <p> " No , " she said . " You 're home 's in Manhattan , where you 're the Golden Boy ; the hot shot TV writer ; the man with the fawning friends . " <p> " Do n't start . " <p> " Well , this is my home . " she said . " This is where I feel like somebody . " <p> " Fine , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ugly . " <p> " It 's not ugly , Anthony , " she responded , calmly . " You just lack the spirit necessary to comprehend the beauty of the West . " <p> " I lack the spirit . . . How long have you been composing that ? " I was looking directly at the boulder at that point , talking to the surface of the rock . Then , just as the thought occurred to me that maybe she was right , maybe we should rethink the wedding , she came around from her side of the rock like opening a door . " I have n't been composing it , " she said . " It just came to me . I just suddenly realized it , why you were having so much trouble with the West . <p> " Oh , " I said . " So now you 've got me figured out . " <p> She gave me one of her coy smiles . She looked me over . " See what the West does ? " she said . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . " <p> " A guy like me ? " <p> Vivian said , " Do n't get petulant , " and then went back into the van . <p> When I did n't follow immediately , she said , " Come on , Anthony . Let 's finish what we started . " <p> She knew that would get me . I went back to the van and we took up where we had left off . When we were done , and I was lying on my back , exhausted , with sleep hovering only moments away , I opened my eyes and saw that she was looking down at me , observing me . She ran her fingers through my hair and placed the palm of her hand on my cheek . I was too tired to respond , which is the way I get after good sex , just useless , absent of all energy . I closed my eyes . I remember thinking , I do n't understand this woman . I found that unsettling , given that we were getting married in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was picturing Little America as a place of green lawns and comfortable beds and two-story houses with bay windows where aproned women watched birds eat seed out of wooden feeders . The predominant color was green . That I found comforting . <p> Vivian 's voice drifted down to me . She said , " I 'm driving tomorrow , Anthony . " <p> I did n't answer . I was in no shape to argue . I just kept thinking about Little America somewhere off in the distance . In my mind , the words hummed round and round like a sad song , a tune full of yearning out in the desert : " Little America , " they said . " Little America , Little America , Little America . . . " <p>
