When Ross Perot challenged George Bush and Bill Clinton in the final debate to explain why they " have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns , " his rivals bobbed and weaved . Clinton deflected Perot 's dare by promising , if elected , to toughen laws governing foreign lobbyists . Bush had a see-no-evil response . " I do n't think there 's anything wrong , " Bush said , " with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country from making his case . That 's the American way . " <P> Lobbying is certainly nice work if you can get it . Governments and corporations  --  foreign or domestic  --  will pay top Washington influence peddlers as much as $45,000 a month . But what is worrisome is that several of the most sought-after foreign lobbyists have attached themselves to the campaigns of Bush and Clinton , offering advice about politics , trade and international affairs , usually for no salary . The contribution enhances a lobbyist 's value to his clients , but it creates at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients who pay their advisers ' salaries . " When lobbyists and politicians team up , " notes Charles Lewis , executive director of the Center for Public Integrity , " there is a sense that only access and influence matters , and that erodes public trust in government . " <P> Because of their proximity to power , the hired guns in Bush 's posse are the most controversial . Charles Black , the unpaid senior political adviser to the Bush campaign , is a partner in the public relations firm of Black , Manafort , Stone and Kelly , which represents a rebel faction in Angola ; the governments of Greece and Nigeria ; and the Pacific Seafood Processors Association , which battled the Commerce Department earlier this year for the right to process a larger share of the $800 million Alaskan pollack catch . James Lake , Bush 's unpaid deputy campaign manager , is a partner in the public relations firm of Robinson , Lake , Lerer &; Montgomery , which represents a variety of clients , including Mitsubishi Electronics , the government of Ukraine and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have refrained from lobbying on issues involved in the campaign and have disclosed to campaign lawyers a list of ( clients , financial holdings and prior lobbying activities . Since early summer , both have promised to forgo lobbying the Executive Branch until after the election . <P> But Lake 's efforts on behalf of several clients earlier this year raise questions about influence peddlers who volunteer their time . Last February , just a month after Lake joined the Bush campaign , the Canadian Forest Industries Council hired Lake 's firm to " track legislation " and monitor " administrative activities . " A month later , the Commerce Department imposed a 14.5% tariff on subsidized lumber imports from Canada under the terms of the U.S.-Canada free trade pact . During the next 10 weeks , Lake twice telephoned Clayton Yeutter , who was then White House domestic-policy adviser ; in a conversation on May 10 , Lake asked Yeutter to take a phone call from a lawyer pleading the Canadians ' case . Five days later , the Commerce Department reduced the duty on lumber imports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any impact on the department 's final decision .
