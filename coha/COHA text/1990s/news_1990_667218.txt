<p> In this sprawling city , where countless strip shopping centers line busy streets , in a blur of franchised blandness , the Lion Plaza is unique . <p> Patrons buy black nuts and lemon grass , squab and intestines at the grocery . There are embroidered satin dresses at a clothing store . A restaurant lists dozens of Vietnamese soups . And few of the signs for the 65 stores are in English . <p> The plaza , whose pink stucco reflects San Jose 's Hispanic heritage , these days caters primarily to Asians - the nation 's fastest-growing minority group . Many achieve inspiring successes , but discrimination , racial tension and poverty still haunt others . <p> Asians are changing the nation 's economy , politics , culture , even its food . Who are they ? <p> Upcoming 1990 Census results will show : <p> - The USA 's Asian population has grown 80% since 1980 , to 7 million , with the greatest number living in California . <p> While Hispanics will be the nation 's largest minority group in the next century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most explosive : They accounted for 42% of immigrants in the 1980s , and some experts say Asians could be 10% of the population by 2080 . <p> - Asians are richer - and poorer . Median household income is highest of any group , including whites , at $ 36,100 in 1989 , compared with $ 28,910 nationally . But Asians also have higher poverty rates than whites : 14% are poor ; 10% of whites are . <p> - Asian immigrants are no longer primarily from China and Japan . The last 20 years has seen an influx of immigration from Southeast Asia . While early immigrants from those countries tended to be well-educated and middle-class , the newest immigrants , like Vietnam 's boat people , often are peasants . <p> - Asians are the best educated group in the USA - about 40% are college graduates , compared with less than 25% of whites . And though Asians make up just 3% of the U.S. population , 19.6% of the Harvard Class of 1994 is Asian . <p> Says economist Louis Winnick , author of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater than their numbers . " In many places , it already is . <p> In San Jose , Vietnamese people operated 3% of the businesses by 1987 . <p> In New York City , where the garment industry had all but disappeared , there are now 500 clothes-making shops run mostly by Chinese . <p> Indians operate more than 10% of the motels in the USA . <p> Even in unlikely spots such as Reno and Tulsa , Koreans run hundreds of small stores . <p> " Our whole family works here . Every department , we have our people , " says Diana Tran , 28 , of her family 's Lion Plaza grocery in San Jose . Vietnamese boat people a decade ago , Diana 's parents opened the market in 1986 . Their second market opens this month . <p> Phung Van Le , a Tokyo-educated Vietnamese who manages a San Jose bank catering to Chinese and Vietnamese , has started four restaurants in five years . <p> " We know this - if you work hard , you will be a success , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together - not as individuals , " says restaurant hostess Sa Dang , Le 's wife . " We save money , do n't spend , because we have a goal . " <p> Their goal is to see their 9-year-old daughter Thu , a straight-A student , succeed . " She wants to be a doctor , " says her mother . <p> For Asians without the credit to go to a bank like Le 's , there 's an ancient practice - kye in Korean , hui in Vietnamese , tanomoshi in Japanese : <p> A dozen friends organize a loan society and each periodically contributes . Money can be borrowed at low interest . When it is repaid , another can take out a loan , and use it to secure a bank loan . <p> While that practice has given many a new start , it has also brought some old resentments to the surface . <p> Asian immigrants were reviled as the " yellow peril " a century ago . But in the last decade , they 've been labeled the " model minority " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't particularly agree with the model minority myth , " says San Jose social worker Thomas Izu , a third generation Japanese-American . " It 's unfair to generalize that all Asian Americans are well off and there are no problems . " <p> The myth also can antagonize others , who complain that Asians lower wage rates by working for less and , because of large families , are hard to compete against . Those complaints have sometimes lead to confrontation : <p> - White fishermen in California and Texas have clashed with Vietnamese competitors . <p> - Blacks in New York and Washington , D.C. , have demonstrated against Korean grocers . <p> - A gunman with a hatred of Asians killed five Southeast Asian refugee children and wounded others in 1989 at a Stockton , Calif. , elementary school . <p> " We 've seen a continuing increase of anti-Asian sentiment , " says Allan Seid , of the Asian Pacific American Coalition/USA . " It seems to be tied in with the state of the economy . " <p> Even in the corporate world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Chinese-American Ray Lou , dean at San Jose State University . <p> Lou calls Asian American executives " 20th century coolies " whose bosses view them as terrific technocrats , but somehow unsuited to top positions . <p> Economic issues are important but as much of a concern to many immigrants is that their children and grandchildren may become too Americanized , losing their heritage and discipline . <p> San Jose 's Phung Van Le 's feelings are typical . " We do n't expect her to be completely Vietnamese , " he says of his daughter , who was born in the USA . " But we do n't want her to be 100% American . ... We expect her to get higher education and do n't go too far to the Western society - so many freedoms . " <p> Others do n't think that will happen . <p> Sociologist Harry Kitano , co-author of Asian Americans : Emerging Minorities , a Japanese-American who was interned during World War II is one .
