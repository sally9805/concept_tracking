<p> Poles , trees , shrubs , and even the ground can , replace traditional supports for climbers <p> Many gardeners imagine that unless they have a wall , pergola , or fence , there is no place in their yard for vines . In this way hey needlessly deny themselves many good plants , and their gardening is the power . The truth is they can encourage these vines to grow up and over trees and shrubs , which will act as their support . The can put up a pole as a suitably placed vertical feature , thereby harnessing some of the free air space . They can treat a vine as groundcover , which sometimes allows a more convenient viewing of its flowers . Or they can tell the vine that it is n't a climber at all , but an ordinary freestanding shrub , a confidence trick that sometimes works , sometimes does n't . <p> It is delightful to imagine your rather dull and solid tree all swatched in blossom other than its own , and this can be achieved but not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tree roots , popping in the vine , spattering it with a badly aimed dribble of water , and walking away . The fact that trees are large , greedy , and thirsty must be taken into account . <p> Say you want to see the pink or white blossoms of a Clematis montana ( the most vigorous species and therefore the most suitable ) draped over the branches of an apple or pear tree . The ideal method is to plant the clematis at the tree 's drip line , well away from the trunk and the worst of the roots . prepare the planting hole thoroughly . If there is turf , skim this off to leave a bared circle four feet across . Se the top layer of soil on one side.Turn over the next spit ( the depth of a shovel ) and incorporate plenty of well-rotted organic matter . ( Should there be unpleasant clay or rubble it with decent topsoil . ) Then return the top spit and similarly enrich it . Make sure that drainage is free . <p> Having planted the clematis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string from the cane to the nearest overhead branch . The vine will climb the string in no time , will take hold of twigs on the branch and will , from then on , be supported from above , its stem forming a liana . Then it will not matter if the string rots ; it will have served its purpose . <p> Sometimes there 's no alternative to planting against a tree trunk . That would be the case with a self-clinging climber such as Hydragea subsp. anomala petiolaris or the nearly related Schizophragma integrifolium , both of which have white lacecap flower heads  --  those of the first in June , the second 's a month later . Virginia creeper ( Parthenocissus quinquefolia ) would be another possibility . In unpropitious circumstances you have to do the best you can with preparing a position . The problem is sometimes overcome by placing a large , bottomless box against the tree 's trunk , filling it with good soil , and planting into that . In time the vine 's roots will find their way down into mother earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . <p> Some of the vines that we in Britain would consider the most suitable for a tree-swathing job , because of their great vigor , are regarded as pestilential weeds in parts of the United States . I have heard of wisteria 's reducing a strong steel structure to something like the mangled remains of an airplane crash . But we should n't close our minds even to thugs such as these , or forget that they are beautiful . To quote that wise old bird Henry Mitchell , author of The Essential Earthman , " Nobody wants to admit it for some reason , but the common wild Japanese honeysuckle that chokes young trees and fences all over the South is very beautiful and quite evergreen , and it can be kept clipped to a pole to make a fine accent plant . <p> This is the way I like to grow a number of my clematis and honeysuckles . The late Dutch honeysuckle , Lonicera periclymenum ' Serotina ' , makes a beautiful column of blossom with buds deep crimson on the outside , opening to cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom window . The odorless L. xtellmanniana makes an even more striking pole feature , with its clusters of apricot-orange flowers . This being a shade lover , I have it on the north side of a honey locust in my mixed border . Not far off , on a 10-foot pole , I have the purple Clematis xjackmanii . Because it flowers on its young growths , it is cut down annually to within a foot of the ground . As the young shoots grow in spring and early summer , I tie them in . ( Last year , because he was particularly tall and happened to be there , I got the editor of New Zealand Gardener magazine , Julian Matthews , to make the final tie for me . ) This clematis makes a column of purple blossom that rears up behind the domes of a six-foot yellow daisy , Senecio doria . <p> Most gardeners , looking for vertical features in a border , will turn to some conifer or other fastigiate shrub , but these will be shaded out and die at their lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back in fall . Whereas with a clematis , you start from scratch each year anyway . If you do n't like its naked pole in winter , you can store it . I should make it clear that the types of clematis to use for this purpose are those which flower on their young wood in summer and autumn . Their pruning is simple , and you do n't have to worry about sorting a clutter of old , dead wood from the young . Everything will be young . <p> In nature , clematis and many other climbers hoist themselves through and over neighboring shrubs . This also looks beautiful in a garden , especially to pep up a shrub , such as a lilac or rhododendron , that blooms early and turns dull . If you ask whether the vine wo n't damage its host , the honest answer is yes  --  a little ( perhaps a lot , but that bit is whispered under your breath ) . All life is competition . Accept that and you 'll feel better . No loss is disastrous ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by a clematis ) . <p> The host shrub should be stiff of habit , so as not to be bowed down by the extra weight . Sometimes this danger can by bypassed by supporting some strands of a clematis on a pole while others are allowed to hang nonchalantly over the neighboring shrub . Sooner or later , let 's face it , the shrub will die , or you 'll grow tired of it , but not perhaps tired of the clematis , which will from then on become a pole specimen . <p> Another way to grow vines is as groundcovers . This makes for a particularly handsome result with the large-leaved Vitis coignetiae . You need to be ready for the fact that it will occupy a lot space and will cover every cotoneaster and berberis within sight , totally engulfing anything smaller . ( You can grow gourds and squashes like this , too . ) <p> This approach is excellent for clematis , especially with those whose blooms naturally face upward . Trained on the usual supports , they have a tendency to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground you 'll have the advantage of being able to see them . One of the most efficient ground-covering clematis is C. xjouiniana . I grow the clone called ' Praecox ' , because its earlier flowering season is more useful to me in my cool climate . For a couple of months it seethes with small , skim-milk-blue blossoms . A range of clematis are suited to masking sawed-down tree stumps , perhaps with the aid of some netting stretched over the stump so that the vine can keep itself in position . <p> I do not recommend leaving tall , dead tree stumps or trunks as features to be covered by clematis , roses , or whatever . I have tried this on a number of occasions . Before long the extra bulk and weight of the incumbent will give the wind such a purchase on the trunk that it will heel over  --  just at that moment when it was becoming truly masked . Best to cut the tree right down . <p> Some vines make handsome freestanding shrubby specimens if there is nothing for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinched back , and you give it a pole for support at the start , wisteria will make a thick-stemmed , self-supporting shrub . I first saw Actinidia kolomikta as a domed shrub in Sweden . It seemed to be perfectly hardy , out in the open , though in Britain its young foliage is subject to damage by spring frosts . You grow it for the extraordinary variegation in its leaves , which are banded in pink , white , and green , though entirely green on the underside . <p> My favorite freestanding , nonclimbing climber is Hydrangea anomala subsp. petiolaris . It makes a chunky specimen , full of character , its young naked stems brightest brown in winter , with fat young buds of green . It is an excellent feature with which to terminate a large shrub or mixed border , easily controlled as to lateral spread and taking many years to reach a height of three feet . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Preceding pages : The vigorous Clematis montana is a perfect match for the large limbs of an Oregon white oak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrub , plant the vine well away from the tree in a prepared hole and provide a swag of twine for the initial connection .
