Ollie Longstreet had been Blight County 's game warden practically forever , and he was as fine a game warden as was possible to imagine . Everyone said so . <p> " Good old Ollie , " they 'd say . Then they 'd go on to point out all his virtues . For one thing , he was tight with the taxpayer 's dollar . Only under the most extreme circumstances would he drive his government pickup off a paved road , for fear of getting it dirty or dented or causing it excessive wear . And he was n't a sneak , either . It was rumored that Ollie had once been seen afoot in the woods , but the source of the rumor was known to make up just such outrageous stories in order to call attention to himself , and so the rumor was pretty much discounted . <p> Ollie made his rounds only during daylight . He said it made folks uneasy to have a game warden prowling around at night . He told how once when he was young and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up behind a couple of men shining a spotlight over a meadow and scared the two of them almost out of their wits , so much so in fact that one man blurted out that they were looking for a lost horse and the other simultaneously said it was a cow , and then instantly they switched sides , the first man taking the cow and the other the horse . Ollie said he felt bad for giving them such a fright they did n't know what they were looking for , so he apologized , wished the men luck in finding their lost animal , whatever it was , and went on his way . <p> Ollie was an understanding game warden , too . If a deer happened to slip into the open trunk of a car for a nap and , not knowing any better , it closed the lid of the trunk after itself and suffocated in there , well , Ollie would be just as amazed as the owner of the vehicle at the gross stupidity of the deer . He would of course confiscate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and starving children at home , as was often the case . Then Ollie would let him keep his deer on the grounds that its stupidity was an act of Divine Providence intended to provide nourishment for nine sick and starving children . Ollie was merciful . Being a decent sort , the man with the deer would stop at Bart 's Saloon , not merely to show off his Divine Providence but to report the game warden 's act of kindness and understanding , and when his report was finished , all those present would raise their glasses in a toast to Ollie and drink to his good health . Ollie was a deeply beloved game warden . <p> Then , without any warning , Fish and Game transferred Ollie to parts unknown . It was a sad day , the day Ollie left , and the boys at Bart 's Saloon stood in the street and waved good-bye to him , not a dry eye among them . The boys at Bart 's hoped the next game warden would be just as kind and thoughtful and considerate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy Sneed , his battered pickup plastered with dried mud , brush twisted up in the front bumper , small trees snagged in the undercarriage . Sneed was tall and wiry , his long legs laced halfway to his knees in leather boots , his eyes hard and cold as frosted steel , his nose fierce as an eagle 's beak , his mouth stern as a nun 's at a frat-house picnic . His expression silently warned , Expect no mercy . <p> The regulars at Bart 's Saloon could n't help but laugh . Bart 's was the favorite hangout of serious poachers , namely Whitey , Shorty , Biff , and Luke . They called themselves the Wild Bunch , which was what others also called them , but with some rather uncouth adjectives attached . Bart himself took considerable pride in being the most infamous poacher of all . Scarcely an evening passed at his saloon when he did n't regale the clientele with his feats of daring in the pursuit of illegal game . Sneed arrested them all within a month of his arrival , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the new game warden was not a man to be fooled with , and that he would never earn the love once bestowed upon Ollie Longstreet . <p> Sneed soon revealed himself to be a sneak , going abroad both day and night , never seeming to tire or sleep . A poacher , thinking he heard the game warden approaching , would take cover behind a tree , and the tree would be Sneed ! It got so that every tree and stump was regarded with suspicion . The game warden appeared to be everywhere in the county at once , and the Wild Bunch speculated that maybe Fish and Game had sent in a whole army of Sneeds . In the first couple of months after his arrival , Sneed made so many arrests and supplemented the county coffers with so many fines that thought was given to building a new courthouse . But before that could happen , poaching fell off in the county to such a degree that the old courthouse was deemed good enough . A few poachers could n't refrain from spotlighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and they became jumpy and irritable , barking at the wife and the nine sick and starving children and yearning for the good old days of Ollie Longstreet . <p> Until the arrival of Sneed , most folks had operated under the assumption that the trout limit consisted of all you could catch plus one fish . Sneed astonished them with the revelation that the legal limit was somewhat less than that . Game regulations became popular reading , and soon some of the worst of the former poachers could recite them verbatim , as if they expected a pop quiz from Sneed at any moment . It soon became apparent that almost everyone in the county had all along believed in strict adherence to the fish-and-game laws and had only been awaiting proper motivation to put belief into practice . <p> The warning " Sneed 's coming ! " cast a chill over the jolliest of hunting camps and sent the occupants frantically checking licenses and tags . His departure left the hunters subdued and shaken , and usually relieved that one of their members and his deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , Sneed earned a reluctant respect in the community , even among the poachers at Bart 's saloon . His arrests became the stuff of legend . There was the time , for example when four men were carrying a poached deer up a steep mountainside in the dark , and the leader of the group , stopping to catch his breath , commented , " Boy , it 's sure a good thing we got four of us to haul this deer out . " And then one of the other poachers replied , " But Bob , there 's only supposed to be three of us ! " Sneed got himself a triple that night . <p> One poacher hit a deer on the road , tossed it in the back of his truck , drove home , threw the deer into an empty bedroom , and closed the door . He knew that Sneed , as usual , would not be far behind . The poacher then raced out to his barn , thinking that would be a good , neutral place to meet the game warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Darcy , " he said , hoping Sneed was n't aware of his bachelorhood . " She took to her bed and is sleepin ' peaceably , so we 'd best not go inside and disturb her . " <p> " She must be feeling better now , " Sneed said . " She just kicked all the glass out of your back window , leaped through the opening , cleared the fence by a good three feet , and headed into the woods . " <p> " She did ? " the poacher said , gazing back toward the house . " Well , I ai n't sorry to see her go . She was a mighty homely woman . " <p> " She was that , " Sneed agreed . <p> That was the first time in the whole history of Blight County that the **28;0;TOOLONG ploy had n't worked . <p> Those who suspected that Fish and Game had sent in not one Sneed but an army of Sneeds seemed to have their suspicions confirmed daily . Sightings of Sneed were reported at different ends of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by in his battered pickup at the very instant he was arresting a poacher on top of a distant mountain . <p> " Saw Sneed up Caribou Crick about noon today , " someone would mention . " Lucky for me the fishin ' was bad . " <p> " Why , that ca n't be , " somebody else would protest . " I saw Sneed this noon eating lunch at Gert 's Gas ' n ' Grub ! " <p> And so it was that Sneed became the stuff of legend . But Retch Sweeney and I did n't buy any of this stuff-of-legend stuff . After all , Sneed was a man . A man could be in only one place at a time . Therefore , Sneed could only be in one place at a time . We were both only about 12 , too young to know any better . <p> " I found a great new place to fish , " Retch told me . <p> " Oh , yeah ? What 's that ? " <p> " Little Sand Crick . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody ever fishes it . " <p> " I wonder how come . " <p> " Cause it 's closed to fishing . " <p> " What 's that mean , " I asked , " ' closed to fishing ' ? " <p> " It means the fishing 's real good , " Retch said . " Particularly since Sneed showed up . " <p> We immediately dug a supply of worms and set off for Little Sand Creek . As we crossed Forker Road , Sneed went by in his pickup . We waved , tentatively . He did n't wave back . The game warden obviously was out on a mission to arrest somebody for violating the game laws , whatever those were , and it would serve the criminal right , too . We poked along for a while , giving the game warden plenty of time to get to the other side of the county . Then we picked up our pace and headed directly through the woods toward Little Sand Creek . After a bit , Retch said , " What ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I answered . <p> " I thought you said something . " <p> " I did n't say anything . " <p> " Probably just a squirrel , " Retch said . <p> " Yeah , a squirrel , " I said . " It must be watching us . I 've got this peculiar feeling we 're being watched . " <p> " Me too . Well , we 're almost to Little Sand and ... Wazzat ? Did that gray snag up there just move ? I thought I saw it move . " <p> " Something moved . I thought it was that big rock . " <p> " No , it was the snag . We 'd better keep an eye on it . " <p> The snag turned out to be only a snag . But then all the birds stopped singing . " You notice all the birds stopped singing ? " I asked Retch . <p> " I noticed that . I wonder what made them stop singing . It 's sure quiet , ai n't it . How come you suppose it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm awful tired today . " <p> " Me too . Maybe we better put off fishing Little Sand Creek until later . It 's closed , you know . " <p> " It 's closed ? Well , we better not fish it at all , if it 's closed , " Retch said loudly , speaking more to the trees than to me . " I just wish you 'd mentioned that to me sooner . " <p> Then one day Tic Blodgett moved to town and more or less took up permanent residence at Bart 's Saloon . " My name 's Tic , " he announced to Bart and the Wild Bunch . <p> Whitey said , " You mean like in ticktock ? " <p> Tic replied , " No , Tic like in lunaTIC ! " Then he laughed that high maniacal laugh for which he would soon be noted . When Tic first heard of the fearsome Sneed , he could n't help but burst into his maniacal laugh . <p> " You boys mean to tell me you 're afeared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat all . My deer season has always opened the first of January and closed the last of December . It be all within the law too  --  my law ! I sets my own limits and I ai n't filled one yet . Ha ! You boys are just amateurs . Your problem is , you ai n't met up with a master poacher till now . " <p> Bart said . " You just ai n't run into a master game warden till now . Let 's see how good you are when you go up against Sneed . " <p> Within a week , Tic showed up at the saloon one night with half a cord of firewood on his truck . " You boys like to come see my firewood ? " he asked . Bart 's regulars trooped outside , just as if they wanted to satisfy a lifelong curiosity about firewood . Tic pulled a chunk of wood from the load and there was a deer leg sticking out . " See here , " he said . " Looks like I got a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lengths on the bottom are only a foot long . Leaves a nice little hollow in the middle of the wood . " The Wild Bunch was impressed . Maybe Sneed was n't invincible after all . <p> Bart studied the load of wood . " Pretty clever , " he said . Some of the boys thought they detected a bit of envy in Bart , as if he wished he 'd thought of the trick himself . <p> Tic said , " I hear you got a deal here , Bart , where anybody that poaches a deer out from under Sneed gets a drink on the house . " <p> " Yeah , right , " Bart said . " You get one on the house . " <p> Tic seemed to poach a deer every other week , selling the excess venison , it was supposed . It was now Tic , not Bart , who held forth evenings in the saloon , relating in infinite detail his latest poaching triumph . Everyone expected Sneed to nab him with a deer in his possession any day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling about the country with his load of cordwood , practically under Sneed 's nose . Night after night his maniacal laugh drifted from Bart 's Saloon , as he regaled the Wild Bunch with his latest trick pulled on Sneed . <p> Occasionally , late at night , Sneed would stop by Bart 's Saloon for a cup of coffee and two stale doughnuts . The room would fall silent , and Sneed would sit alone at the end of the bar , the only sounds the clink of glasses and the click of pool balls . Sneed would finish his coffee and doughnuts , lay 15 cents on the counter , stretch , glance around at the denizens of the saloon , give them his " no mercy " look , and then stroll out to lay his traps for poachers , particularly for Tic Blodgett . Tic 's maniacal laugh would drift out behind him . As time passed , Sneed began to look worn and haggard , his eyes lost some of their hardness , and after a while , even the " no mercy " look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter of the crafty Tic Blodgett and of his failure to nab the little poacher . <p> Tic laughed his maniacal laugh . " I 'm a wearin ' Sneed down . Wo n't be long now till he vanishes altogether . Then even you boys can take up poachin ' again . You too , Bart ! " <p> Early one evening , Bart posed an interesting question to Tic . <p> " How come we never see any of these deer you claim to have poached ? Why , that deer leg you showed us , it might have been no more than that , a deer leg . And here all along I been giving you a free drink every time you claimed to have poached a deer , without a bit of further evidence . " The more Bart talked , the angrier he got , and Bart was not a man anyone wanted to anger . Pure meanness was one of his better qualities . " Before I hear one more boast out of your yap , you better bring me in a whole deer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's see you go get a whole deer . Not just a leg but a whole deer ! Right now ! " <p> " Take it easy , Bart , " said Tic . " Sure , if that 's the way you feel about it , I 'll go poach a deer right now , maybe two or three . You 'll see . Be back before midnight . You can pour me the whiskey right now , Bart . " <p> Midnight came and went , but no Tic . Presently , Sneed walked in and ordered a cup of coffee . Under his arm he carried a short stick of firewood , which he set on the bar next to his cup . After finishing his coffee , he said , " You do n't happen to want a stick of firewood , do you , Bart ? " The saloon owner shook his head . So the game warden walked out with the wood under his arm . <p> Bart was furious . " Some miserable no-good rat tipped off Sneed ! " he roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I 'll break him in half , and that 's just for starters ! One of you boys snitched on Tic for no good reason other than you was just plain jealous of his God-given talent for poaching ! " <p> Tic never again showed his face at Bart 's Saloon , probably because of embarrassment . <p> Sneed soon regained his " no mercy " look . Poaching in Blight County declined to a modest level and remained there for the next 20 years that Sneed was game warden . Deer became smarter and seldom if ever climbed into car trunks for a nap . Addition improved countywide , particularly in the counting of trout . The beloved Ollie Longstreet was forgotten . And Bart again held forth in the evenings about his once glorious days as the greatest poacher Blight County had ever seen . <p> As far as anyone knew for certain , the snitch who tipped off Sneed was never discovered . Some of the Wild Bunch , of course , thought the snitch might be none other than Bart himself . <p> " Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar ? " Shorty said . " It was some kind of message to Bart . " <p> " Yep , that was a tad suspicious , " Luke said . " Ole Bart looked mighty uncomfortable , too . " <p> " You bet , " Biff said . " I tell you what we ought to do , and that 's ask Bart straight out if he was the one who snitched on Tic . Ask him right to his face ! " He slammed down his glass for emphasis . <p> " Yeah ! " the rest of the Wild Bunch chimed in . " The sooner the better ! " <p> Just then Lester Conckle got into a big argument with Bart over a gambling debt and called him some vile names , and even threatened him , and right after that Lester disappeared and was never seen again , although Bart did get the occasional postcard from Lester saying , " Wish you was here ! " <p> The Wild Bunch really hated hearing about that postcard . They still intended to ask Bart straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snitch . But what with one thing and another , they just never seemed to get around to it .
