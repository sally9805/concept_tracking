" Dinosaurs , " Lou Levin said , " let 's face it , we 're a pack of goddamn dinosaurs . " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Irv Brodsky asked . <p> " It means , " said Levin , " that guys like us are destined no longer to appear on the face of the earth . We 're soon to be extinct . The way we think , the way we act , Jesus , even handball , the game we play , is on its way out . Nobody under sixty plays this game any more . " <p> Slowly slipping off his knee brace , Moe Bernstein , though he did n't say anything , tended to agree . None of the sporting-goods stores carried handballs any longer ; you could n't find a proper pair of gloves anywhere in the whole city . Only here at the Horwich Jewish Community Center was there equipment for the game he and his friends loved . <p> Once upon a time , handball was a game for serious athletes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and right hands , which not everyone , even the best athletes in other sports , could do . Players tended to be stocky , the better not to be pushed around on the court . Moe himself was five foot five and weighed 180 pounds , thick in the legs , barrel-chested , a real handball build . He still thought of himself as in good shape , even though breathing came heavier now and he and his friends confined themselves to playing doubles , and for only an hour at that . <p> " Lou 's right , " Sid Melman chimed in . " It 's another world . I was telling Sam Kantor , my broker , the other day about my niece . She announced she 's converting to Catholicism . ' Do n't complain , ' he says to me , ' my own daughter , at thirty-three , last week tells my wife that she 's a lesbian and is moving in with another broad . Next to lesbian , Catholicism is nice , Buddhism is nice . Shit , I 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Levin , " is precisely why you 're a dinosaur , Sidney . " <p> " Up yours , Louie . " <p> " Said like a true schmuck dinosaur , " replied Levin . " Look , boys , the rules have been changed . We got caught in the switch . Everyone now can do what he likes . It 's open season on everything . Delay no desire . Stop saving . Stick it anywhere you please . Walk away from any mess , any time . All this comes a little late for us , but whose fault is that ? " <p> Stuffing his gear  --  jock , shorts , sweat socks , gloves , knee brace  --  into his gym bag , Bernstein could have contributed his own stories to the conversation , his own chronicles of the brave new world they all lived in , but decided against it . What was the point ? Levin was probably right . They were dinosaurs , Moe included . He felt the calluses on his hands , mementos of half a century of swatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even his hands marked him as a dinosaur  --  but at least he was a dinosaur who still had a great kill shot . <p> Bernstein drove his Buick , a Park Avenue , the five blocks from the JCC to his house on Fargo . He had kept the house after Sylvia died four years ago , though what he needed with three bedrooms , two baths , and a finished basement he could n't exactly say . It seemed like too much trouble to move . Besides , he did n't mind mowing the lawn in spring and summer ; in the autumn there were the leaves to rake ; and he still had the back muscles for shoveling snow , though this past winter he had begun to feel it . <p> The neighborhood was changing , but still safe . Korean families lived in the houses on either side of his , and an Indian physician , an anesthesiologist , lived across the way ; his wife walked the neighborhood in saris . On Devon , once the main hub of shopping in the neighborhood , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California Avenue  --  many sari palaces , as they called them  --  while west of California the ultra-Orthodox Jews dominated . The tonier Jews had long since departed : to Lincolnwood and Highland Park and Glencoe . <p> Nothing of interest in the mail : bills , catalogues , charity appeals , the usual junk . You want to get letters , Bernstein reminded himself , you have to write letters . Who today wrote letters ? You called long distance , or faxed . There was also something called e-mail , or so he had heard . He had decided to take a pass on the whole computer thing ; at sixty-seven , he figured he was close enough to the grave to get away with it . He had thought about installing a car phone , but decided no . <p> He did have a VCR , which he used occasionally to record a Bears game when he was going to be out of the house . When he first got the thing , he rented movies , mostly the old ones he had grown up with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cagneys and Spencer Tracys , but he soon lost interest . Television news and the Cubs and Bears and Bulls gave him all the entertainment he needed . Most nights he went to bed before ten anyhow . <p> Bernstein popped a Stouffer 's frozen lasagna into the oven , then , gym bag in hand , walked upstairs . The room next to the master bedroom he had fixed up for his grandson , Nathaniel , soon after he was born , though the kid almost never used it . Bernstein had put Big Ten pennants on the walls along with a blown-up photograph of Walter Payton somersaulting into the end zone against the Packers and another of Babe Ruth finishing a home-run swing . In a bookcase were a few of his own handball trophies , a copy of Abram Sachar 's History of the Jews , and a plaque from the Israel Bonds office with Bernstein 's first name Morris misspelled Maurice . <p> He had never bothered to redecorate the master bedroom after his wife 's death , and so it remained essentially a woman 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold frames , great lacy throw pillows over the flowery bedspread , and a frilly ruffle on the bed . His thick body slept alone in that feminine double bed . Whole days went by now when Bernstein forgot to think of Sylvia . They had been married forty-two years when she died . Sometimes , out in the car , at odd times of the day , he would try to recall her face and , concentrate though he might , he could not summon it up . After Bernstein himself died , there would be no one left to summon up his own . There was his son , of course , and there was his grandson , but he doubted he was likely to be on the mind of either for very long . <p> When the Stouffer 's was ready , Bernstein fixed himself a salad of iceberg lettuce which he covered with Kraft Thousand Island dressing , poured a glass of ginger ale , and took it all into the den . Setting it on a TV table before his favorite chair , he turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories about west-side murders , south-side arsons , northwest-side juvenile-gang warfare , and , for comic relief , political scandals . At the break after the weather , he returned to the kitchen to cut a slice of Sara Lee cheesecake , which he ate while watching the sports news . <p> After washing the dishes , Bernstein transferred himself to the couch to watch the Cubs-Cards game . It had , he thought , lighting a cigar , been a pretty good day . For the past thirty-four years Bernstein had been a salesman for the Toledo Scale Company , and had made a damn good living . Good enough , at any rate , to buy this house , send his son through college and law school , never drive a car more than three years old , and  --  himself a child of the Depression , and hence always a careful saver  --  live without any real financial worry . He no longer had to scramble for business the way he once did . He continued to service his old accounts , mostly butcher shops , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling scale stickers and register tapes . He had notified the home office that he would take retirement at seventy , less than three years away . <p> Bernstein had started off the day by dropping in on Mikhail Petrovich , a Ukrainian butcher who had been using an antiquated machine , originally produced in 1948 , which he took over when he bought the shop and which had finally broken down completely . With scarcely any effort on Bernstein 's part , Petrovich had bought a $4,600 scale , the biggest ticket item in Bernstein 's line . After writing up the order , on the way out of the shop , he heard Petrovich , in his greenhorn accent , say to his assistant , " You know , I wake this morning , I never dream I buy scale . " <p> Bernstein unlaced his shoes , put out his cigar , propped a pillow behind his head , and let his mind wander , the Cubs game playing like Muzak in the background . His mind drifted to his son . He had never really approved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never his cup of tea . She was pretentious , hipped on psychology ; he could never feel close to her . And the mother was even worse . Before marrying a woman , it 's always a good idea to have a close look at the mother , so you see what 's in store . <p> Much as he had wanted to alert his son to steer clear , Sylvia warned him against doing so . Besides , even though Leslie was his only child , Bernstein had never been that close to the boy . He could n't tell you why , but they never had the kind of relationship where the father could have slipped his arm around the son and said , " Look , Leslie , you 're in some pretty serious trouble here . These women are crushers . No one 's got you in a hammerlock . Cut and run while there 's still time . I 'll cover you . I 'll take some of the flak . Say your old man does n't want you to marry so young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all the way . " <p> Of course , Bernstein thought at the time , he could be wrong . Nothing harder to figure than marriages . All begin in sexual attraction and most end in personal irritation . Yet sometimes the most impossible combinations , marriages you would have thought never had a chance , worked out just fine . So Bernstein never said a word ; he went along with the show . <p> And quite a show it was . The Shapiros must have spent no less than forty grand on their daughter 's wedding  --  like Leslie , Deborah was an only child . Seymour Shapiro , a lawyer specializing in personal injury , turned a big buck . Bernstein would never forget the fuss Miriam Shapiro made when the rabbi showed up at the Drake Hotel without the huppah . He remembered the rabbi muttering something to the effect that the less religion people had , the more they insisted on the niceties . The bridal couple had written their own vows , of which Bernstein could now recall nothing except that he had shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi , from a Reform temple in Glencoe , spoke in an English accent and seemed to get seven or eight syllables into his pronunciation of the word Israel . <p> The kids , Leslie and Deborah , appeared to get on well enough . Leslie finished law school . Deborah taught " exceptional children , " which Bernstein later learned meant that they had serious problems . She called Bernstein " Dad , " but it never felt quite right . Three years they waited to have a child of their own . When they wanted to move from the city to Highland Park , Leslie came to his father to ask for a loan of twenty-five grand to help with the down payment , and of course Bernstein lent him the money , no interest . <p> Bernstein should have sensed trouble when Leslie showed up one day wearing a mustache . It was brown and so luxuriously thick it looked as though it might be made of mink . Bernstein restrained himself from mocking the boy , but he could n't take this seriously . " Leslie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store that with Traeger the furrier in the summer ? " Soon Leslie began to show up in Italian suits , double-breasted jobs , with ample shoulders ; they went , Bernstein understood , for a grand apiece . He wore loafers with gold chains . A funny way for a lawyer to dress . <p> It was at Passover dinner at Bernstein 's own home that he first realized trouble was brewing . Between the fish and the soup , his daughter-in-law began to cry and had to leave the room . His son excused himself , then came back ten minutes later to say he was sorry but they would have to leave , Debbie was so upset . In some panic himself , Leslie told his parents he would call later to explain . Nathaniel was not yet two at the time . <p> What Leslie had to explain was that he was leaving his wife and moving to Seattle with a young paralegal in the office , a girl named Lisa Podolfski . When Bernstein asked his son if he had thought this through , Leslie replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . When Bernstein next asked if he was prepared to accept his responsibilities as a father , Leslie countered that he would do everything he could at a distance of two thousand miles . Why Seattle ? Bernstein wanted to know . Because , Leslie explained , he had lined up a job with an important law firm there . And besides , it was a beautiful city , one of the prettiest in America . <p> As a lawyer , Leslie had to know that the Shapiros were a family that played hardball . Bernstein reminded him that no injury was more personal than divorce ; they were n't about to let him off the hook . Miriam Shapiro would want to exact vengenance , see that her ex-son-in-law paid till it hurt . There were ways of fighting that , Leslie replied . He was n't , after all , himself a lawyer for nothing . <p> The long and short of it was that a year and a half after Leslie left his wife , his new lady friend had left him . Two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legal visitations with his son : a month in the summer , a week in the spring , another week at Christmas . As far as Bernstein knew , Leslie kept up alimony and child support , but he had cut himself emotionally free . He claimed the visits with the boy were too stressful  --  that was the word he used , stressful . And , besides , he said , Nathaniel 's mother and grandmother had poisoned the boy against him . <p> At Sylvia 's funeral , Leslie told Bernstein that of course he had a bad conscience about Nathaniel , but what was he supposed to do ? He brought along with him a young woman with blond hair flowing down her back named Yolanda with whom he was living at the time . He had a permanent , and was wearing a gold chain around his neck . Leslie , thought Bernstein at the time , Leslie , my son and heir , you are a phony and a Putz . <p> Bernstein awoke with a jolt and a sour taste in his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm felt numb . Everyone knew this left-arm business was the first sign of a heart attack , so he had to be careful he was n't imagining symptoms that were n't really there . He rose from the couch . He was all right on his feet ; not shaky or anything . But the sour taste would n't go away , even after he had walked into the kitchen and rinsed out his mouth . The constricted feeling in his chest , caused by heartburn or heart attack or some hot peppers he had had for lunch or whatever the hell it was , refused to go away . Breathing was n't easy . He slipped into his pants and , in some pain , bent over to lace his shoes . <p> The nearest hospital was St. Francis , in Evanston . Bernstein decided not to call an ambulance but to drive . He did so easily enough , though the traffic light at Western and Howard seemed to last for a goddamn fiscal quarter . He heard a voice say , in Petrovich 's greenhorn accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heart attack . " He parked on the street and walked into St. Francis through the front door , asking the way to the emergency room . The numbness in his left arm and shoulder seemed so insistent as to be humming . <p> They strapped him to an EKG machine , which revealed that his heartbeat was irregular , though only slightly so . They gave him some pills . They suggested he stay the night for more tests , which he agreed to do . The next afternoon a cardiologist named Arnold Meyers , a man in his forties with a manicure who seemed too well-dressed and who knew his son 's former in-laws , recommended that Bernstein undergo a bypass operation . His heart attack  --  yes , it had been a heart attack all right  --  was a minor one , but a harbinger of worse to come . <p> " What if I do nothing ? " Bernstein asked . He saw all those men walking around the Horwich Center with their elaborate , zipper-like scars : up the leg , where the vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been sewn in . He 'd heard stories about the post-operative depression a lot of guys went through . <p> " If you do nothing , " said Dr. Meyers , more than a touch of menace in his voice , " you are likely to die some time within the next two or three years . You figure to have a number of these attacks , to grow weaker and weaker , and , owing to the absence of oxygen getting to your heart and finally to your brain because of your clogged arteries , a final stroke or heart attack will take you . " <p> " How soon you want to do this surgery ? " Bernstein asked . <p> " The sooner the better , of course . But it 's probably best not to put it off for more than a few weeks . Fortunately , this last little attack  --  and there may have been others  --  did not do damage of a kind serious enough to prevent surgery . " <p> " I 'll get back to you , " Bernstein said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the hospital . <p> Before he reached home  --  less , that is , than twenty minutes later  --  Bernstein had decided not to go ahead with the surgery . What did he need it for ? He did n't feel like putting himself through the ordeal , and he did n't feel like changing the way he lived , which this young doctor claimed he would have to do even if the surgery succeeded . Lots of guys checked out on the operating table-no guarantees there . Heart attack or stroke , when you came to think about it , were n't bad ways to go . Both beat slow cancer deaths , let alone an extended nightmare like Alzheimer 's . <p> Bernstein was alone in the world . Nobody depended on him . He 'd had his innings ; he 'd had a pretty good roll of the dice . So he would n't get to eighty-the age at which his father died and which he had always thought he would reach . But he had a shot at seventy : three score and ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pig . He would settle for seventy . <p> At home , Bernstein popped in a Stouffer 's Salisbury steak , opened a small can of corn niblets , another of stewed tomatoes , which he set to warming on the stove . He checked the calls on his answering machine . Only one , from his former daughter-in-law , Deborah . " Dad , " the message went , " I could use your help this weekend with Nathaniel . Please call when you have a free moment . " <p> While his steak was still in the oven , Bernstein dialed Deborah . <p> " Oh , hi , Dad , " she said in her slightly distracted way . " You got my message ? " <p> " Of course , " said Bernstein . " What is it ? Nothing wrong with the boy ? " <p> " Nothing at all . Why I called is that I 've been invited to spend this weekend with friends in Wisconsin , at Green Lake , and there are n't going to be any children there . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 're free , if maybe Nathaniel could stay with you ? " <p> " Sure , " Bernstein said . " When do you need me to pick him up ? " <p> " It would be great if you could come get him on Friday afternoon . I 'll be back by early Sunday evening . " <p> " No big problem , " Bernstein said . <p> " Thanks a million , Dad . You 're a lifesaver . " <p> That Friday afternoon , on his way to pick up his grandson , driving out to Highland Park along Sheridan Road , the fine trees forming a tunnel overhead , the mansions on the lakeside of the street seeming as impressive as ever , Bernstein thought about his death . Now that he had made the decision to forgo surgery , the weather , which he had never been all that concerned about , somehow seemed more important . His days , he now knew , were numbered , and he wondered what their final tally might be : 396 , 582 , 712 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , alone , no hospitals , no tubes in his nose or catheters up his gazoo . If he was lucky , he would expire without too great a struggle : a choke , a cough , a battle for breath , over and out . <p> His business was in order . He had a will . He had an insurance policy worth two hundred grand . He had another hundred fifty grand and change in savings , mostly in CD 's and Israel bonds . Bernstein did n't think the stock market was for little guys like him , and so had stayed away from it . His house was worth maybe another hundred and a half . All this would go to his son . It would buy a lot of Italian suits and loafers  --  buy lots of dinners for lots of Yolandas . Bernstein did n't much like to linger on the subject . <p> As for what waited on the other side , there , Bernstein assumed , was nothing . Lights out . Oblivion . End of story . He was someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put Leslie through Hebrew school , just as he had himself gone as a boy , but the truth was he never could visualize either God or heaven . Yet , he now thought , he had always acted as if there were a God . He had tried to be hardworking , faithful , honorable , decent , within what you might call big-city limits . He was no angel , but neither was he a son-of-a-bitch . He tried to do what was right . What was disappointing , as he now thought about it , was that he had n't made any real difference to anyone else 's life . Not even to Sylvia , who was very self-sufficient and who , had she not met and married Moe Bernstein , would probably have had a similar life with someone else . <p> Bernstein parked his Buick at the side of his daughter-in-law 's house , the same house for which he had lent his son twenty-five grand for the down payment . Two Mexicans were working in the yard . Deborah 's red Toyota was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , " Deborah said when she came to the door . She put out her cheek for Bernstein to kiss . They were a very kissy family , the Shapiros . Bernstein was not from the ready kissers , and always found greeting his ex-daughter-in-law a bit awkward . <p> Deborah , now in her mid-thirties , was starting to show her mileage , mostly around the eyes , which looked to Bernstein sad and tired . A woman raising a little boy alone had no picnic ; Bernstein , though he did not care much for Debbie , allowed her at least this much . <p> " How go things with Leslie ? " she asked , when Bernstein had come in . <p> " He 's pretty well , " Bernstein said , knowing this line of questioning was as unpromising as it was inevitable . " You know Leslie . " <p> " Yeah , " she said , " I know Leslie . " <p> " Where 's Natey ? " <p> " Nobody ever calls him that , " she reminded him . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathaniel , " she said , " everybody calls him Nathaniel . " <p> She called her son to come down , handing Bernstein a small suitcase she had packed for him . She also gave him a bottle of pills for Nathaniel 's allergies and a piece of paper with a telephone number where , in case of a crisis , she could be reached . Bernstein had long ago been informed that Nathaniel was allergic to grass and dust . There was n't much to be done about it . Apart from building the kid a cottage on the moon , or letting him live in an igloo , he was always going to be vulnerable . <p> Vulnerable is how Nathaniel looked as he came down the stairs . He was thin , he wore glasses , and as if  --  toss in his allergy  --  that was n't enough , this past winter he had had braces put on his upper teeth . <p> " Hi , Grandpa , " the boy said . <p> " How are you , son ? " Bernstein replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I guess so . " Nathaniel did not sound very enthusiastic . <p> " Kiss your mother goodbye , " Deborah said , <p> " and do n't forget to take your allergy pills . Grandpa 's got them . " <p> Bernstein noted the boy 's scrawniness , in his T-shirt and shorts , as he permitted himself to be hugged by his mother . Bernstein waited outside , a few steps down the walk , to avoid the awkwardness of another kiss from his former daughter-in-law . <p> " Thanks again , Dad , " Deborah said , " I 'm really very grateful . " <p> In the car , Bernstein did n't have to tell his grandson to buckle up ; the boy did it automatically . He was a cautious kid . On the way back to West Rogers Park , Bernstein asked a number of questions that did n't seem to lead anywhere . Was he looking forward to going back to school in a few weeks ? What were his current interests ? What was the meaning of the turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ninja , Bernstein 's eyes began to glaze . It occurred to him that he would not be alive to see this boy turn thirteen . <p> They stopped to pick up a few videos , and at home Bernstein put a couple of chicken pot pies in the oven . He asked Nathaniel if he 'd like a glass of ginger ale , but the boy said he 'd prefer milk , which Bernstein did n't keep in the house ; he gave him orange juice instead . After dinner , they ate ice cream in the den , where the cartoon videos Nathaniel had selected quickly put Bernstein to sleep . <p> " Grandpa , " Nathaniel said , " Grandpa , better get up . It 's eleven o'clock . " <p> Bernstein awoke in a daze . Nathaniel had already taken the videos out of the VCR and removed and washed their ice-cream dishes . He was , Bernstein began to sense , used to looking after himself . After all , his mother , who had long ago left teaching and now worked as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school . <p> Nathaniel slept in pajamas , Bernstein in a Lawson YMCA T-shirt and his boxer shorts . He put Nathaniel in the bedroom with the Walter Payton and Babe Ruth photographs . Tucking the boy into bed , Bernstein was n't sure whether or not he was supposed to kiss him goodnight . But as he put his grandson 's glasses on the night table , he leaned down and kissed his forehead . <p> " ' Night , Grandpa . " <p> " ' Night , kid , " Bernstein said . " Do n't let the bedbugs bite . " <p> " What 's that mean ? " <p> " It 's a long and an old story , kiddo . It goes back to when people were poor and did n't always live in the best conditions . I 'll explain in the morning . Sleep well . " <p> At 2:37 by his digital clock Bernstein awoke to the sound of sobbing . He found his grandson crying in his sleep . Instead of turning on the light , he picked the boy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the bed as gently as he could so as not to wake him . <p> " OK , sweetheart , " said Bernstein , lightly patting his grandson 's back with his callused hands , " it 's OK , nothing to worry about . Your grandpa 's with you . Nothing bad 's going to happen . " <p> Soon the sobbing stopped . Bernstein lay down next to the boy and slipped his arm around him . His thick hairy arm touched the boy 's ribs . God , the kid is thin  --  this was Bernstein 's last thought before he fell off to sleep . <p> Next morning Bernstein rose at his usual six o'clock and , before showering , ducked out to the Jewel to pick up some milk , hot dogs and buns , potato chips . He also bought a pound of corned beef and a rye bread in the deli section . <p> When he returned home , Nathaniel was awake . " Grandpa , " he called out as Bernstein came in through the back door . He was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pajamas and robe . <p> " How did I get in your bed last night ? " <p> " I was wondering that myself , " Bernstein said . " I 'll bet you sleepwalked . I was glad to have you there , though . It was cold for a summer night . Now what d' you want for breakfast ? How about I scramble up some eggs for us ? Or make French toast ? Your grandma taught me years ago to make very good French toast . " <p> " I 've already had my eggs for the week , " Nathaniel said . <p> " How many do you have ? " <p> " Mommy does n't think it 's a good idea to eat more than two eggs a week . She watches our diets . " <p> " What can you eat ? " <p> " How about some juice and toast and yogurt ? " said the boy . <p> Nathaniel ate his toast without butter . Bernstein had no yogurt in the house . After they both showered , Bernstein asked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the boy did n't have much strength or endurance . When Bernstein asked if he wanted a Coke with his lunch , Nathaniel said he 'd prefer Perrier , which Bernstein did n't have . The kid just nibbled on the corned-beef sandwich Bernstein made . His stomach was easily upset , he confided , and he was n't supposed to eat spicy foods . <p> The Cubs were out of town , but through his friend Irv Brodsky , Bernstein had been able to get a couple of tickets to the White Sox game that night . Nathaniel was not exactly thrilled at the prospect . Bernstein knew the kid was n't much of an athlete , but now he learned he had no interest even in watching sports . The only things he played , it seemed , were computer games . <p> " Your dad is a big sports fan , you know , " Bernstein told him . " When he was a kid he knew everything there was to know about every active player in both leagues and a lot about some players long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , " the boy said . Bernstein remembered that Leslie had left when Nathaniel was only two . His other grandfather apparently had n't spent all that much time with him , either , and after the divorce Bernstein too had tended to drift away , the ambiguities of dealing with your son 's ex-wife being too complicated for him , especially after Sylvia died . He sent his grandson a birthday gift , gave him another at Hanukkah , and saw him at most four or five times a year . Sometimes he would have a guilty conscience and would telephone , but the conversations were always unsatisfactory . Like the other men in Nathaniel 's life , Bernstein , too , had checked out . <p> " Look , " he now said . " We do n't have to go . " <p> " It 's up to you , Grandpa . " <p> " No , Natey , it 's up to you . I want you to enjoy yourself . How about we go out to dinner and rent another movie ? Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the boy said , looking up through his thick glasses . Bernstein had the feeling that his grandson was accommodating him , not the other way around , and felt a surge of love for the boy . He found himself wondering how things might turn out if he , Bernstein , were to raise him . He would do a damn sight better job than his mother , or than he himself had done with Leslie . He imagined taking the boy with him to a place like Arizona , where no one knew either of them , and teaching him all he knew about being a man and surviving in a tough world . But this was pure fantasy , not something Bernstein normally allowed himself to indulge in . <p> They ate at a Greek restaurant on West Devon , in Lincolnwood , after stopping to pick up an old Lassie movie . At dinner Bernstein told Nathaniel about all the great animal movies he remembered from his youth : Rin . Tin Tin , Lassie , My Friend Flicka , and others whose names he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that the hero of the video they had rented was a young Peter Lawford  --  in later life , apparently , a stooge for Frank Sinatra and a procurer for President Kennedy . Wonderful English accent , though . <p> " Grandpa , Grandpa , " Nathaniel said , rousing Bernstein gently . Once again he had fallen asleep , and once again the boy had rewound and taken out the cassette . <p> " Did things work out OK , Natey ? " Bernstein asked . " Lassie come home all right ? " <p> " Yeah , Grandpa , " the boy reported , seriously , <p> " it all worked out fine . " <p> Upstairs , they brushed their teeth together , the boy in his pajamas , Bernstein in a T-shirt that read " B'nai B'rith Handball Championships , Men 's Seniors , 1979 . " Nathaniel asked for dental floss , but Bernstein had none . He made a mental note to stock the joint with yogurt , Perrier , and dental floss for his grandson 's next visit . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but decided not to , lest the boy think his grandfather was babying him . <p> Bernstein awoke on Sunday morning , the sun shining into his room , the acrid smell of urine in his nostrils . Nathaniel 's room was empty , the sheets stripped from the bed . He called out his name , and the boy answered from the basement . There , in his jockey shorts , a sharp bone protruding in a little bump from each of his shoulder blades , Nathaniel stood near the washing machine , trembling . A wash was already churning away . <p> " I had an accident , Grandpa , " he said , remorsefully . <p> " I see that , " Bernstein replied . " Are you OK ? " <p> " ( Yeah , " said Nathaniel . " I 'm OK . I 'm sorry I made a mess . " <p> " Do n't worry about it , " Bernstein said . " C'm on upstairs , I 'll give you something to wear . " <p> Back in the kitchen , Bernstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his grandfather 's Detroit Senior Nationals T-shirt . <p> " Natey , " said Bernstein , " does this happen to you often ? " <p> " Just every once in a while , " said the boy . " Dr. Holtzman tells Mommy it 's nothing to worry about . " <p> " Dr. Holtzman ? " <p> " She 's Mommy 's therapist . Mine , too . " <p> " You see a therapist ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " For how long has this been ? " <p> " Three years . " <p> " How often ? " <p> " Just once a week . " <p> " What $o you talk about ? " <p> " Mostly about my missing not having a father and stuff . " <p> " But you have a father . " <p> " ( You know what I mean . " <p> Again Bernstein had a desire to pick the boy up , load him into the Buick , and just drive off . They 'd buy clothes later . He 'd take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his glasses and braces , this bed-wetter and sobber in his sleep , worried at age eight about his diet and already seeing a therapist , toward this small bundle of bones and anxieties , not at all the sort of grandchild he would ever have imagined having , Bernstein felt a stab of protective love such as he had never felt before in his life . Listening to his grandson recount his sessions with the therapist , Bernstein went foggy in the eye and had to hold back the desire to weep . <p> A handball game had been scheduled that afternoon , and so Bernstein took Nathaniel along with him to the Horwich Center . He introduced him to Levin and Brodsky and Melman . <p> " How are ya , Nate ? " Brodsky asked . " Gon na be a handball player like your Grandpa ? " <p> " Probably not , " the boy answered , humorlessly . <p> " I suppose a handball genius like your grandfather comes along only every four generations or so , " said Lou Levin . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernstein said . " I 'll make him pay for it on the court in a minute or two . " <p> The four old athletes suited up for their game , slipping into their jocks and sweat socks , shorts and shoes , putting on their special bandages and supports : Bernstein his knee brace , Melman a pad for his left elbow , Brodsky an Ace bandage around the thigh , Levin his corset for a back that tended to go out on him . <p> After whapping the ball around for a half-hour or so , Bernstein took one low off the back wall with his left hand and zapped it , cross-court , into the crease of the front wall on the right  --  a winner , a zinger , a beauty . He looked up to the balcony where his grandson stood watching . Bernstein waved , the boy waved back , flashing a dark smile with his wired-up teeth . " Great shot , Grandpa , " the child yelled . Bernstein 's heart jumped . <p> Later that afternoon , driving Nathaniel home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road along the North Shore , Bernstein could not help thinking of all the secret miseries , little and large , that must reside in these vast homes with their tennis courts , German cars , and healthy-looking daughters with suntanned legs . People passing his own ex-daughter-in-law 's house , with its careful landscaping , could not know that it sheltered a sweet and sadly screwed-up little boy . <p> " You know , Natey , " Bernstein said . " I was fourteen when my father died . So I know a little bit about living without a father . Maybe not as much as you , but a little bit . " <p> " Did you love him , Grandpa ? " <p> " I guess I did , Natey , but you know , I never really saw all that much of him . He was from the old country , Russia , and he worked in the produce market on Fulton Street . He used to go to work at four in the morning . When he 'd come back at four or so in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong foreign accent , my father , your great-grandfather . He worked very hard . He did n't have a lot of time for his children or for anything else but his work . " <p> " Did you miss him when he died " <p> " I did , Natey , but I knew that life had to go on . Just like it has to go on for you . You drew a terrible card , having parents who could n't live together ; and then another bad one when your Dad moved to Seattle . But , you know , you ca n't let that knock you out . You 've got to be tough . You 've got to survive so that some day , when you 're a father , you 'll never do anything to cause your own son or daughter to feel all the sad feelings you 've had to feel . " <p> The boy did n't reply . He was looking straight ahead . Bernstein silently cursed the seat-belt , which prevented him from pulling the boy closer , slipping an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I ca n't promise you things are going to work out , Natey . I wish I could . Life 's a tough pull , if you know what I mean . But you ca n't let it beat you . Sooner or later , everyone is called on to be a man . Your problem is that you 've been called on much earlier than most guys . But you 've still got to try . You 've got to give it your best shot , you know what I mean , Natey ? " <p> Bernstein 's words suddenly sounded hollow to him , a combination of psychotherapist , rabbi , and Knute Rockne . In the end , after preaching to the boy , he , too , would drive away . Another bullshitter . Words were n't going to help his grandson . This was a boy whose life was missing something no words could ever give back . If the sins of the fathers are supposed to be visited on the sons , Bernstein thought , maybe it also worked the other way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Natey , " Bernstein said , as the Buick pulled up in the driveway before the boy 's house , " would you by any chance like me to teach you to play handball ? " <p> " Would you have time ? " <p> " I 'll find time . It 's a great game , and I 'd really like you to learn how to play it . " <p> " I 'm not sure I can do it , but I 'll try . " <p> " You can do it , Natey . It 's in your blood . Suppose I pick you up next Sunday morning . You 'll come with me to the Center and we 'll work out for an hour before my game with the boys . You 'll warm your grandpa up . How 's that sound ? " <p> " It sounds like fun . " <p> The boy released his seat-belt buckle . Bernstein got out of the car with him , handing him the small suitcase from the back seat . He put out his hand , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gently on the back . <p> " Next Sunday at eleven . Bring your gyms and a pair of shorts . " <p> Holding his suitcase against his thin leg , the boy waved as Bernstein backed out of the driveway . <p> On Monday , at ten of twelve , just before breaking for lunch , Moe Bernstein called Dr. Arnold Meyers from a pay phone on Roosevelt Road to announce he was ready to schedule bypass surgery . <p> " No doubt about it , absolutely none , Mr. Bernstein , " the young cardiologist said , in a somewhat smarmy voice , " you 've made the correct decision . " <p> A good deal less than certain himself , Bernstein hung up and stepped around the corner into Manny 's Delicatessen , where he ate a four-inch-high pastrami sandwich on a kaiser roll , a potato latke the size of a cake dish , and a heaping serving of rice pudding , all washed down by two cups of black coffee . Sure , OK , all right , let them cut out his whole heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had another think coming . <p> Joseph Epstein is editor of the American Scholar . His latest book of essays .
