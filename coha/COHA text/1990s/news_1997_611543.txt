<p> Researchers for the first time have cloned an adult mammal , a controversial feat that could presage the ability to clone human beings . <p> The startling achievement , long thought to be biologically impossible , was accomplished with sheep , the first of which , named Dolly , was born in July in Edinburgh , Scotland . <p> A total of nine cloned lambs have been born so far using the new technique , each an identical genetic " twin " of the parent from which it was cloned . In theory , the same technique could be used to make unlimited copies of any single adult animal , the researchers said . <p> The Scottish scientists who conducted the work said their goal was not to clone humans , but to create large herds of specially engineered farm animals  --  including some that would produce human medicines in their milk and others that would contain " humanized " organs suitable for transplantation into people . <p> Herds of cloned animals custom-made to have human diseases could also prove useful in the search for cures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , barns filled with identical sheep all suffering from cystic fibrosis could replace the cages full of mice that are now the workhorses of such research , allowing testing of new drugs on animals whose lungs resemble human lungs much more than mouse lungs do . <p> The researchers acknowledged , however , that there was no reason in principle why the surprisingly simple technique they used could not be applied to human cells . That could allow virgin women to give birth to identical copies of themselves and might even allow the " resurrection " of genetic duplicates of the recently deceased . <p> Medical ethicists and others said they could not think of a justification for using the technology on people . <p> " Most people who have thought about this believe it is not a reasonable use and should not be allowed , " said George Annas , a bioethicist and professor of health law at Boston University . " The real question is : How can it be prevented ? You ca n't very well stop a rich person from setting up a lab on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks there 's no one worthy of his inheritance except himself . " <p> Annas said even some of the more compassionate applications , such as using the technique to make a duplicate of a child who has died in a tragic accident , were beyond the pale of what most Americans  --  including scientists  --  believe to be ethical . <p> " This is not a case of scientific freedom versus the regulators , " he said . " I do n't think even the Army wants a clone of a special commando unit . " <p> The Scottish researchers denied any interest in making copies of people . " We 're simply not interested in working with human material , and we think it would be ethically irresponsible to do so , " said Ian Wilmut , who with Keith H.S. Campbell of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh led the research . <p> Such research is prohibited in Britain and some other countries , Wilmut said . In the United States , federal funds can not be used to conduct human embryo research , but there are no legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loophole that some ethicists say should be closed by new laws . <p> Controversial human applications aside , scientists in this country said they were astounded by the success and overwhelmed by the potential for agricultural and medical advances made possible by the new method . Researchers have tried to clone adult mammals for many years with no hints of success , and most had all but given up . <p> " It flies in the face of biological dogma , " said Neal First , an animal biotechnologist and chairman of reproductive biology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison . " Work in mice and other animals had convinced us all it could n't be done . " <p> In 1994 , First was the first to clone cattle , but he did so by using cells from cattle embryos  --  a method that others have used to clone other animals including mice . That technique can be used to create multiple identical animals . But scientists using that method do not know exactly what traits their clones will have because the clones are made not from the genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeveloped embryos that are made from a mix of genes from a father and mother . <p> By contrast , the new work creates identical copies of an adult animal , whose characteristics are known and deemed desirable , using only its genes . <p> To do so , the Edinburgh team and researchers at Roslin-based PPL Therapeutics took unfertilized eggs from sheep and removed all of the eggs ' DNA , leaving behind just the gutted cell with the nutrients and cellular machinery needed to foster embryo growth . <p> Under normal circumstances , the maternal genes that the scientists removed would have been joined by genes from a sperm , providing a full set of DNA necessary to trigger embryo growth . Instead , the researchers added a full dose of genes from a single mature cell removed from the udder of an adult sheep . <p> With the egg thus endowed with a full complement of genes , a mere spark of electricity from a lab technician was sufficient to start the egg dividing into an embryo , the researchers found . After a few days in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wombs of surrogate mother sheep . Each resulting ewe , born a few months later , was genetically identical to the animal that had donated the DNA . <p> Although scientists have tried similar techniques in the past , they failed to recognize one key requirement , Wilmut said : The donor cell must first be treated with chemicals that " reset " that cell 's biological clock in a way that leaves its DNA poised to divide anew . <p> There is no reason why the same approach could n't be done with human eggs and cells , inserting the genes of any living  --  or perhaps dead  --  man or woman into unfertilized eggs and implanting them into a surrogate mother to allow them to develop normally . <p> Details of the work will appear in Thursday 's issue of the journal Nature , but were reported over the weekend by the Observer of London , immediately sending shock waves through scientific and bioethics communities worldwide . <p> In the United States in particular , where human embryo research has become a political football in recent years , scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fears that the feat could lead to overly restrictive limits on related but less controversial areas of research . <p> " I think some embryo research should be allowed , " because it could lead to new treatments for infertility and an understanding of certain inherited diseases , said James Thomsen , a researcher at the University of Wisconsin . " But because emotions are so strong on the subject , this could end up harming good research . " <p> In December 1994 , a panel convened by the National Institutes of Health determined that the cloning of humans raised overwhelming ethical concerns and should not be allowed , but that certain kinds of human embryo research were ethical and scientifically valid and ought to be permitted with federal funding . <p> President Clinton disagreed and immediately directed the NIH not to fund any human embryo research . That move created a regulatory vacuum for privately funded embryo researchers at fertility clinics and universities , who often voluntarily follow whatever guidelines the NIH promulgates . Unwilling to kill their research programs altogether , private research institutes in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biotechnology industry representatives yesterday tried to assure the public of the industry 's high ethical standards . <p> " We 've been opposed to human cloning since the days that it was still a theory , and now that there 's an indication it may be possible , we urge it not be done , " said Carl Feldbaum , president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization . <p> " For now , we ought to do what researchers did in the ' 70s when they were n't sure of the consequences of genetic engineering : They called for a voluntary moratorium on that kind of work . If voluntary restrictions are not sufficient , then perhaps it ought to be prohibited by law , " Feldbaum said . <p> Wilmut of the Roslin Institute said it was still too soon to envision the possibility of generations of identical human clones . " Right now it 's a thing for fiction , for films and books . We simply do n't know if it 's possible , " he said .
