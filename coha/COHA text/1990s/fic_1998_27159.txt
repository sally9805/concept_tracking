It is a fond and universally held notion that only things of the spirit truly endure : love , sunsets , music , drama . Marble and paint are subject to the ravages of time . Yet it might be argued that nothing imperishable can move the spirit with quite the impact of a ruined Athenian temple under a full moon . There was something equally poignant in the wreckage the Roadmakers had left behind . One does not normally equate concrete with beauty . But there it was , formed into magnificent twin strips that glided across rolling hills and through broad forests , leaped rivers , and splayed into tributary roads in designs of such geometrical perfection as to leave an observer breathless . And here , in glittering towers so tall that few could climb them in a single day . And in structures whose elegance had survived the collapse of foundations and roofs . The engineering skills that created them are lost . Now the structures exist as an integral part of the landscape , as familiar to the children of Illyria as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save as a tether to a misty past . Perhaps most striking , and most enigmatic , among them is the Iron Pyramid . The Pyramid dominates the eastern bank of the river . Despite its name , it is not madefrom iron , but from a metal that some believe is artificial . Like so many Roadmaker materials , it seems to resist rust and decay . The structure is 325 feet high , and its base measures approximately a quarter-mile on a side . It 's hollow , and the interior is given over to vast spaces that might have been used to drill an army , or to conduct religious exercises . Roadmaker cups and combs , dishware and jewelry , toys and knickknacks have been excavated from the ruins and now fill the homes and decorate the persons of the Illyrians . They too are made of material no one can duplicate ; they resist wear , and they are easy to keep clean . Rinny and Cohn rarely thought of the ruins , except as places they 'd been warned against . People had fallen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were even tales that the wreckage was not quite dead . Consequently , adolescents being what they were , they favored the ancient concrete pier a mile north of Cohn 's home when they wanted to drop a line in the water . On this day , rain was coming . The boys were fifteen , an age at which Illyrian males had already determined their paths in life . Rinny had established himself as a skilled artisan at his father 's gunmaking shop . Cohn worked on the family farm . Today both were charged with bringing home some catfish . Rinny watched the storm build . When it hit , they would take shelter in Martin 's Warehouse at the foot of the wharf . Martin 's Warehouse dated from Roadmaker times . But it was still intact , a worn brick building with its proud sign announcing the name of the establishment and business hours . Eight to six . ( The Preservation Society kept the sign clean for tourists . ) Cohn shifted his weight and squinted at the sky . " Something better start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnips again tonight . " So far , they had one fish between them . " I think they 've all gone south , " said Rinny . A damp wind chopped in across the river . It was getting colder . Rinny rubbed his hands and tightened the thongs on the upper part of his jacket . On the far side , a flatboat moved slowly downstream . They were rigging tarps to protect themselves from the approaching storm . " Maybe we better think about clearing out . " " In a minute . " Colin stared hard at the water as if willing the fish to bite . The clouds were moving out over the river from the opposite shore . A line of rain appeared . Rinny sighed , put down the carved branch that served as a fishing pole , and began to secure his gear . " I 've got a bite , " said Cohn . He grinned . " That 's better . " " Right . One each will go a long way . " Cohn tried to bring it in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " He pulled hard but the pole bent close to breaking . There was a dark mass in the water . " What is that ? " " It 's not a fish , " said Rinny , disappointed . A boot surfaced . A boot with a foot in it . Cohn dropped the rod and the foot sank back into the water . " I do n't understand it . " Flojian Endine stood away from the bed so Silas could see the body . Karik seemed to have shrunk year by year since his abortive expedition . Now , in death , it was hard to remember him as he had been in the old days . " I 'm sorry , " said Silas , suspecting that he was more grieved than Flojian . " Thank you . " Flojian shook his head slowly . " He was n't the easiest man in the world to live with , but I 'll miss him . " Karik 's cheek was white and cold . Silas saw no sign of injury . " How did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sketch of a wandering river running between thick wooded slopes hung on the wall . It was black-and-white , and had a curiously unfinished look . The artist had titled it River Valley . In the right-hand corner he 'd dated it , and signed his name , and Silas noticed with a mild shock that it was Arm Milana , one of the people lost on the Haven mission . The date was June 23 , in the 197th year since the founding of the city . The expedition had left Illyria March 1 of that year , and Karik had returned alone in early November . Nine winters ago . " He liked to walk along the ridge . See , up there ? He must have slipped . Fallen in . " Flojian moved close to the window and looked out . " Maybe his heart gave out . " " Had he been having problems ? " " Heart problems ? No . Not that I know of . " Flojian Endine was a thin , fussy version of his father . Same physical model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prosperous , energetic , bright . . . .
