The chronically depressed market for the short story has not discouraged Alice Munro , who , with the publication of The Love of a Good Woman ( Knopf ; 340 pages ; $24 ) , now has 10 volumes of stories to her credit . But it 's Munro 's quality , not quantity , that puts her in the company of today 's most accomplished writers of fiction at any length . <P> Three virtues distinguish Munro 's work . First , she packs more life into 30 pages than most novelists get into 300 . And she does it writing about her native region , homely farm-town Ontario . Second , she moves her characters through time and space with the calm and precision of an air-traffic controller . Third , she writes mostly about women at turning points and points of no return . <P> A striking example is the unmarried narrator of Before the Change , who is back home for a visit with her father , a local physician who communicates in sarcasms . The hidden truths about their unshared lives pop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by casting the story as an unsent letter from the woman to her former lover . <P> " R. My stomach is still a little puffy . There are no marks on it , but I can bunch it up in my hands , " is the first hint we get that the unnamed letter writer has been pregnant . By the time she tells her doctor dad that she had a baby and put it up for adoption , she knows his secret : the " specials , " as he calls some of his patients , are young women who have traveled long distances to get illegal abortions . From there , the father-daughter ironies gather for a stoic conclusion . <P> In stories such as Cortes Island , The Children Stay and Rich As Stink , women are stretched beyond the limits of convention by passion and circumstance . They are not complainers . Reticence is the pervading style of Munro 's rural Ontario , where " drawbacks and adversity were not to be noticed , not to be distinguished from their opposites . " Munro breaks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers can pull this off . It takes a balance of compassion and detachment worthy of Minerva , the goddess of wisdom . <P>  --  By R.Z.
