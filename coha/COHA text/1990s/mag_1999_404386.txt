When Harvey Littleton turned off his glass furnace in Spruce Pine , North Carolina , in 1991 , he had just completed the hot work for some of the finest sculptures of his career . There is an amplitude to these pieces that mirrors Littleton 's mental energy and creative scope , as in the magnificent Crowns of the mid-80s which culminated the Topological Geometry series . Not as muscular as the earlier work , the Implied Movement and Lyrical Movement pieces are less mathematical , more romantic . Their interplay of air and light expresses a reflective poetry , embodying a concept which came to Littleton when he sailed his masthead sloop across the Atlantic several years ago . The desire to get his hands on the material has been the defining impulse of Littleton 's life . Glass is the material he has found " endlessly fascinating . " To create the largescale sculptures of the late 80s and early 90s , he worked side by side at the furnace with two assistants . When an inherited back problem threatened to relegate him to the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his attention to a second application of the glass medium he had pioneered . Less dramatic than his founding of the studio glass movement in the 1960s , his initial investigation into printing from glass plates in 1974 has led to the development of vitreography , which is the current outlet for his restless and revolutionary spirit . A retrospective exhibition , " Harvey K. Littleton Reflections , 1946-1994 , " inaugurating the Mint Museum of Craft + Design in Charlotte , North Carolina ( January 10-July 4 ) , and organized by the museum 's curator , Mary F. Douglas , charts the artist 's creative odyssey and places his contributions in the context of the postwar craft movement in the United States . The emphasis is appropriate . Like the ceramic sculptor Peter Voulkos and other pivotal artists of his generation , Littleton was educated under the GI Bill . After receiving his M.F.A. degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art under Maija Grotell , he established a national reputation as a potter . A challenge from his peers at the American Craft Council 's national conference in 1959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring glassblowing into the artist 's studio . The single greatest impetus to the studio glass movement was provided by a glassblowing demonstration by Littleton and his students in 1964 , at the First World Congress of Craftsmen , sponsored by the American Craft Council at Columbia University in New York City . Born in 1922 , Littleton absorbed his experimental approach to glass from his father , who was director of research for Corning Glass Works in upstate New York . His mother filled their home with colored Steuben vases designed by their neighbor Frederick Carder . As a college student , Littleton found a summer job as a moldmaker in the glass works , and he twice cast small neoclassical torsos in the factory 's 96 percent silica glass , which had a translucency and refinement similar to pate de verre . " I wanted to do glass from the beginning , of course , " Littleton has said . " I wish I had ! " Indoctrinated with a belief in the technological superiority of industry , however , he was unable to envision the possibility of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the University of Michigan , a compromise with his parents , ushered in a brief partnership in an industrial design firm . A contract to reproduce 700 likenesses of Henry Ford in photosensitive glass taught him the techniques of cutting , polishing and sandblasting . Also captured in glass was a striking portrait of Littleton 's bride , Bess Tamura .

He joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , in 1951 , honoring a tradition of university teaching on both sides of his family . His research interests-wood-firing and salt-glazing-little used by studio potters at the time , led him to residencies at traditional Jugtown Pottery in North Carolina and a folk pottery in Spain , the latter during an eight-month European sojourn in I957-58 , which renewed a connection initiated when he served in Italy with the Army Signal Corps . Visiting glass factories in Naples and Murano and meeting Jean Sala , who previously had blown glass alone in Paris , convinced Littleton of the viability of glass as a studio medium . Back on his farm in Wisconsin , he mixed batch formulas in stoneware bowls , heated them in a ceramics kiln and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassblowing workshops he led at the Toledo Museum of Art in spring and summer 1962 greatly benefited from the technical assistance of Dominick Labino , vicepresident for research and development of the Johns-Manville Corporation , despite Labino 's initial skepticism concerning his friend 's project . The first glassblowing course at a university in the United States was offered that fall in Littleton 's studio . While teaching his students in Wisconsin , he was also spreading the word at universities across the country . Marvin Lipofsky , Littleton 's first M.F.A. graduate in glass ( 1964 ) , recalls , " None of us knew what was going to happen with glass . Harvey 's support was the thing that kept us going . " Lipofsky would later introduce glass at both the University of California , Berkeley , and the California College of Arts and Crafts . Investigating European glass factories in I962 , Littleton met Erwin Eisch , heir to a long-standing Bavarian tradition in glass and an artistic revolutionary in his own right . An invited guest at the First World Congress of Craftsmen , Eisch saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Littleton in teaching a session at Wisconsin that summer , a bond developed between the two which accelerated the spread of the glass movement worldwide . Another conferee , Sybren Valkema , returned to Holland to build the first " little painstakingly mastered the techniques required to blow a symmetrical form and afterward turned everything he had learned on its head . His work expressed the flagrant denial of function : mounting a blown form neck-downward on a base immediately transformed it into sculpture . Engrossed in both hot and cold working processes , he burst open the glass at the furnace and sliced it with a diamond saw . He frequently incorporated metal . Later he utilized the slumping process to modify the industrially produced forms with which he constructed some of his largest pieces . Meanwhile , Littleton was campaigning for the acceptance of glass by galleries and museums . His first one-man exhibition of glass at a museum took place in 1963 , when approximately 6o objects were tucked into a single case at the Art Institute of Chicago . Two years later his work was honored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another of Littleton 's efforts that shaped the evolution of glass as an art medium was his insistence that for an artist to develop professionally , each piece sold must command a price high enough to underwrite the cost of further creative experiments . His former student Dale Chihuly has successfully carried this concept far beyond even Littleton 's expectations .

In the mid-60s , " everything had to be different . Glass itself was different , so then everything you did had to be different ! Now I see Harvey working on . . a major body of work for years-not for days-refining , developing , expanding . " A single technique , the overlay , became the basis for sustained creative development . Littleton initially drew a thin overlay of vivid color over a clear glass core . A sequence of overlays separated by heavier layers of clear glass produced concentric rings of color . Squared in cross section , cut at various angles and polished , these concentric forms constituted the Solid Geometry series . Later Littleton flattened the forms while hot and encouraged them to bend and twist in the heat of the furnace , creating the Topological Geometry series . In the Implied Movement and Lyrical Movement sculptures , by contrast , the overlays produced a subtle shading , and the glass became so attenuated that the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deeply etched sheets of glass , the products of a sandblasting demonstration , which he suddenly thought to ink and run through a press . Some of the resulting prints were spectacular . From a spare corner in his studio in the 70s , the print facility has grown to a 1,250-square-foot building with a resident master printer . Artists from the United States and abroad are invited to work there for varying periods of time . Their strongest prints are editioned , each print becoming a collaborative effort of the studio . The unique physical characteristics of glass offer conspicuous advantages : its chemical stability prevents it from tainting colored inks as metal may ; its resiliency under compression ensures that the plate will produce editions of remarkable consistency ; and , of course , its transparency makes it possible to transfer an image to a plate while being guided by a drawing placed underneath . Most exciting , however , is the unparalleled versatility of glass as a print medium . Using a single glass plate , the artist can combine the effects of planographic printing , resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of etching on copper plates . The Littleton studio 's digital camera and broad format printer further expand the possibilities by allowing the incorporation of computer-generated imagery . Glass continues to engage Littleton on many levels . His vitreographs explore new possibilities for the medium , often echoing the themes of his sculpture . In the boldly geometric White , White , 1998 , which combines computer-generated imagery with sandblasting , the digital transfer ensures the consistency of the subtle tonal gradation . Littleton 's glass collection has become increasingly a preoccupation in recent years . Now that his stamina has been restored by laparoscopic back surgery , he frequents antiques auctions in Florida looking for pieces of special significance . It is also a great source of pleasure that his younger daughter and his two sons share his involvement in glass in various capacities . Forty years after Littleton found the first glowing crucible of molten glass awaiting him in his pottery studio , the field he envisioned is rich beyond his fondest dreams . His influence has been incalculable , reaching though his students to generations of their students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some of us found our way through glass because of Harvey .
