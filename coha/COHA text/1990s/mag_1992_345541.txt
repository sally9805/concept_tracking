Think for a moment about the world 's 1 billion refrigerators and its hundreds of millions of air conditioners . Picture mountains of foam insulation , seat cushions , furniture stuffing and carpet padding . Imagine streams of cleaning fluids , rivers of industrial solvents , wafting clouds of aerosol spray . <P> Ridding the planet of the millions of tons of ozone-depleting chemicals contained in that vision is not just a big job ; it may be the biggest job the nations of the world have ever taken on . In the 60 years since Du Pont began marketing the miracle refrigerant it called Freon , chlorofluorocarbons have worked their way deep into the machinery of what much of the world thinks of as modern life  --  air-conditioned homes and offices , climate-controlled shopping malls , refrigerated grocery stores , squeaky-clean computer chips . Extricating the planet from the chemical burden of that high-tech life-style  --  for both those who enjoy it and those who aspire to it  --  will require not just technical ingenuity but extraordinary diplomatic skill . <P> The technical challenge is relatively straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can replace CFC-based systems without doing further harm to the stratosphere  --  an endeavor that is well under way . In fact , it may turn out to be easier than anyone expected . Except for medical aerosols , some fire-fighting equipment and certain metal-cleaning applications , there are now effective substitutes for virtually every ozone- depleting chemical . Some cost quite a bit more , and others pose different , if less severe , environmental problems . But in a surprising number of cases , the new processes are actually cheaper and better than the old . <P> Replacing CFCs in newly built equipment , however , is only half the job . Virtually every existing refrigerator and air conditioner is a CFC reservoir . The chemicals are not a problem as long as they continue to circulate within an appliance . But if the machine is carelessly drained , junked or damaged , the CFCs can escape to attack the ozone . The real task for those countries that invested heavily in CFCs in the past is to develop systems for recovering and recycling the chemicals they have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , Europe and other industrialized regions to do right by the stratosphere is one thing . They bear direct responsibility for most of the damage that has been done , and they can best afford the costs attached to switching technologies . But what about the countries of the Second and Third Worlds ? Many of them are just beginning to enjoy the comforts of CFC technology , and they can not easily pay for a changeover .
