TITLE : CHILDREN OF PARADISE : SHOOTING A DREAM <P> AUTHOR : STEVEN EPP , FELICITY JONES , DOMINIQUE SERRAND AND PAUL WALSH <P> WHERE : THEATRE DE LA JEUNE LUNE , MINNEAPOLIS , MINNESOTA <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The story behind the making of a screen masterpiece proves poignant and gripping onstage . <P> When Germany invaded his country , the choices confronting French director Marcel Carne were stark : he could stay and make movies as though nothing were happening and be accused of collaborating , or he could flee to someplace where he could not speak the language well enough to create . Carne stayed . The chief result , Les Enfants du Paradis ( 1945 ) , is a splendid sentimental tribute to 19th century populist theater , and to the acrobats , clowns , pantomimists and courtesans who created a street life to counter the staid classicism of the Comedie Francaise . <P> The film may have looked escapist at the time . But its central themes  --  the conflicting claims of loyalty , ambition and love , the psychic links between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on performers by aesthetic dunces in high places  --  had immediate relevance for Carne and his colleagues . Now a wonderfully imaginative troupe of French origin , settled for more than a decade in Minneapolis , has found the melodrama surrounding the making of the movie just as rich a wellspring . <P> Children of Paradise : Shooting the Dream is an intricately layered celebration of the street shows Carne admired , a re-enactment of much of his movie , a backstage soap opera about his colleagues , a moral assessment of the choices they faced and a paean to their enduring impact . It starts by hemming spectators into the lobby of the Theatre de la Jeune Lune 's gorgeous new $3 million home , where they are jostled by pickpockets and a woman on stilts during a raucous raree , full of the horseplay and menace of Carne 's " street of many murders . " Once the action moves inside , there is more striking symbolism . In one nearly metaphysical moment , an actor playing part of the film 's crew ponders a tiny model of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a full-sized one awaits interior scenes . <P> The initial aura of mystery fades , but the story  --  of a studio abandoned as the puppet government sags toward collapse , of company members mysteriously beaten or sacked or just disappearing , of a leading lady sentenced to death for consorting with a German officer  --  is fascinating and mainly factual . <P> It triumphs over mediocre acting . In a cast of 23 , the only strong playing comes from Dominique Serrand ( also the play 's director and coauthor ) as Carne , coauthor Felicity Jones as leading lady Arletty and set designer Vincent Gracieux as screenwriter Jacques Prevert . Their brainchild is one of the foremost efforts this year on any U.S. regional stage . By a marvel of foresight , it will live further as the first-ever " import " into Yale Repertory Theater 's season just after the Minneapolis run ends on Jan. 9.
