From a ridge on Mount Holyoke  --  the mountain , not the college  --  Tracy Kidder looks down at Northampton , Mass. , near where he lives . He has just written an impressionistic portrait of this old New England community , Home Town ( Random House ; 349 pages ; $25.95 ) . From his perch , he dreams up a lofty introduction that concludes , " ... the cornfields are a dream of perfect order , and the town seems entirely coherent , self-contained , a place where a person might live a whole life and consider it complete , a tiny civilization all its own . " Then , beguiled by a sentimental image , he adds , " The town below fits in the palm of your hand . Shake it and it snows . " <P> Not really . That sugary last sentence , conjuring a toy town in a glass paperweight , does n't describe Northampton or , fortunately , Kidder 's fond but unsentimental book . The author 's great gift , in fact , is for looking at his subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a New Machine ( 1981 ) , about the development of a supermini-computer , and in House ( 1985 ) , about the jostling interchanges among architect , builders and buyers of a private home . <P> Kidder surveys Northampton through several sets of eyes  --  those of a local judge , a shelf of historians , a gabble of politicians , a small-bore drug dealer and an adult scholarship student at Smith College . But the observer who tells most of the story  --  whose life , to a considerable extent , is the story  --  is a not quite middle-aged town cop named Tommy O'Connor . If what he had to tell were simply the reports of night patrols , arrests made , cars chased , shots taken or withheld , the view would be a narrow kind of truth . But O'Connor was born in town  --  his father Bill was the county treasurer  --  played Little League here , has seen jobs dry up and the downtown decay , and then , with the mixed feelings that natives reserve for too prosperous newcomers , has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into economic health . He has watched the decline of his own Irish as a force in the town , and the rise of activist lesbians and utterly apolitical , though mildly troublesome , kids with green hair and nose rings . He 's a tough , no-fooling cop , but he 's able to say , and mostly believe , " All the lunacy , that 's half the beauty of it . This is a great town to work in . " The half-mocking nickname he has earned from fellow cops is " Father O'Connor , " and he will joke and scold and reason with a cranky teenager , and listen for a long time to a young mother whose record of staying off drugs is not quite spotless . <P> The author of this extraordinary job of reporting and writing sees the town 's humanity through this very human cop , but well before a reader might say , " Yes , yes , got it , " he veers off to tell other stories . What he finds amazes him . You 'd be overcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and you were forced to look down  --  " and not just by malignancy and suffering , but by all the tenderness and joy , all the little acts of courage and kindness ... to apprehend it all at once  --  who could stand it ?
