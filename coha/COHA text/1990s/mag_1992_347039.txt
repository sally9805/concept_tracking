What then is the American , this new man ? " asked French immigrant Hector St. John de Crevecoeur in 1782 . Two hundred ten years later , many Americans answer , " No one . " America has always treated its ethnic and racial minorities abominably . The only consolation they have for being shut out of the mainstream is that they should never have wanted to join it in the first place . Happily  --  what with multicultural education and bilingualism  --  the very concept of a mainstream is being junked . <P> The facts that get pitched around in the multicultural debate are all familiar . Immigration has reached levels higher than at any other time since the turn of the century . Majorities or near majorities of students in some big-city school systems speak English as a second language , if they speak it at all . An urban underclass seems cut off from any culture , much less mainstream American culture . What is new , however , is not the facts but our attitudes toward them . Once upon a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : obliterate the differences . Today increasing numbers of nominal Americans refuse to see America as anything more than a collection of ZIP codes . Their ideal is Yugoslavia , without machine guns . Multiculturalism , in the words of historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , " belittles unum and glorifies pluribus . " <P> The stakes are high , and so is the decibel level . Why then is only one side of the argument being presented effectively ? Schlesinger 's alternative to multiculturalism is " an open society founded on tolerance of differences . " That sounds pretty pluribus , professor . If the toleration of differences is the be-all and end-all of America , then why not tolerate multiculturalism ? <P> A less mealymouthed defense of the American character would begin by acknowledging its historical roots in the behavior of the Anglo settlers of 200 and 300 years ago  --  what are known today as Wasps . The Ur-Wasps brought with them a load of cultural baggage , which they unpacked when they arrived . Their load included a politics of natural right , derived from English Whigs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ritual and theology ; and a near religious belief in the virtues of working hard and getting rich . These traits reinforced one another : pulpits proliferated under nonauthoritarian government , and the work ethic flourished under the stimulus of earnest preachment . <P> The ways of the Wasp linger today , despite condoms and Madonna . America attracts hard workers from abroad and breeds them at home , whatever Japanese politicians may think . Thomas Jefferson could still vaguely recognize our politics ( Aaron Burr would certainly recognize our dirty politics ) . Survey after survey finds that Americans are the most religious people in the industrialized world , and the seriousness with which we take our sex scandals amazes cynical Europeans .
