Anna Version 2 <p> As she closed the door behind her , Anna noted that the living room was still arranged to accommodate the Christmas tree . Pieces of furniture jostled for room in the corners , leaving the space in front of the window empty . A few days before , it had been happily crowded with lights and presents and stray scraps of wrapping paper . Pushing a chair toward the window to fill this gap , Anna caught her reflection in the small ceramic mirror a friend had given her a few days before , now hanging on the wall . An eye , a nose , a chin , pieces of her looked back as she squinted into the glass . <p> She sat down in the chair , the room lit only by the low wattage of the hall lamp . Her breathing became more rhythmic , and she lay her head back against the soft cushion . A postparty atmosphere permeated the room , a feeling that combined anticlimax and relief with the smell of a little stale cigarette smoke and leftover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual New Year 's dinner with her mother an accomplished fact . And it had n't been so bad , really . It just might be that she was beginning to endure her mother 's silent criticism with equanimity . <p> Her mother had called Anna a month before , right on schedule . " I 'm coming out to see you , " she said in the short way she had . " Not for the holidays , mind you , because there are the grandchildren to see out here , but in January . New Year 's or so . And do n't mind putting me up , I 'll do just fine in a hotel . I 'll just pass through on my way to Aunt Benedicta 's . " <p> Anna had n't argued with her but had merely written down the date and time the airplane would be landing . She had long since realized that neither of them appreciated the pretense that it could possibly be more comfortable for everyone if her mother stayed at Anna 's apartment . <p> Anna threw her coat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleeping , his head nodding over an open magazine , with the table lamp still on . The bed was warmed with him , the sheets mussed , the comforter in a series of haphazard lumps in preparation for two bodies . She felt a simple visual joy at seeing this man with a few gray hairs about his temples , his strong , honest nose , and the calm motion of his even breaths . It was such an ordinary moment , a daily miracle that there was another who welcomed her presence . <p> Sam was not somebody she was ready to share , and she had told her mother he would n't be able to join them for dinner . He would have tempered her mother 's disapproval . But this made Anna uneasy ; it was as though her mother 's acceptance could be won only when proof of a man 's admiration was presented , like a coupon . She did not want her mother to know Sam yet . <p> Waiting alone at the airport for her mother 's plane to land , Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramamine and lobsters-in-a-box . She had moved away from her family to escape the nervous encounters with her mother . Her two younger sisters , Patrice and Diana , still lived within a town or two of their mother , and they gathered often with her to share coffee and family stories . Anna alone was the wayward child . At thirty , she had committed the double sin of remaining unmarried and making more money than both of her sisters ' husbands combined . <p> But the greatest sin was something Anna had carried around with her since childhood . Anna 's weight was not something that could be hidden . Standing before the generic city postcards in the airport gift shop , she remembered herself as a child , huddling in the back of the car , Patrice craning her head to see out the window , baby Diana sleeping peacefully , their mother driving rigidly in the front seat . Once again , they had gone through the humiliating family tradition of fall back-to-school shopping , the ordeal Anna dreaded from the last sticky June day of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses with flounces and bows . Anna permitted her mother to cram the largest sizes over her head , over her curves and roundness . If anything could be fully zipped up , she would turn in red-faced triumph to the mirror , only to be greeted by a parody of Patrice , the pleats vanished , bows sticking out in frantic retreat from the polka dots . This went on for hours as Patrice played with the display of hair ribbons and Diana screamed in boredom . Her mother would study her , a slight frown about the corners of her mouth as an anxious shop clerk offered suggestions . On the verge of tears , Anna silently tried to pretend she was somewhere else : wandering in the woods , curled up on her bed reading a book . Her embarrassment only increased when the clerk was kind and smiled and talked to her . She wanted only to be invisible , for her disappointing body to disappear altogether . <p> After carefully counting out the bills to purchase the bundle of things for Patrice , Mother stalked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two older girls following a few steps behind . As they fell into the back seat , her mother shook her head and clicked her tongue . <p> " Look at those legs . They 're tree trunks ! I thought I had forbidden you to eat ice cream this summer . If you had listened to me , you could have gotten some nice things today . " She sighed and closed the door , pushing her hair away from her face as she slid across the smooth vinyl seat of the old Chevy . " Maybe the Sears catalogue will have something . I hate asking Grandma to make your school dresses again . " <p> Anna 's throat ached with the pain of concealed tears . Next to her , Patrice distanced herself , as she always did when her mother had these outbursts . Anna did not have the heart to be angry at this defection , as she , too , wanted to separate herself from the cause of such displeasure . <p> " Self-control , " her mother said . " It all comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel were bitten down to the quick , and then covered over with a coat of glossy pink nail polish . Being alone with the children was difficult . Maybe her mother 's temper would have been better had she not awakened one morning to find that her husband was gone , and had left only a note . <p> Anna wondered if her father would have defended her against her mother 's onslaught . She imagined him , his dark features hazy in memory , commanding his wife to be quiet . She banished the one clear memory she had of him , hiding behind the sports page of the daily paper , only appearing in their lives to voice his displeasure . <p> They were a sort of club , the four of them , or at least that was what their mother tried to tell them when she was keeping her temper . Girls only . No men allowed . No men at all , except for the lawyers her mother typed memos for from eight to one every weekday . During that time , Anna sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the other little girls , the thin , pretty ones whose mothers smiled at them . She knew most of them had fathers who came home every night from work . Anna felt that it was unfair to be fatherless , to have a mother who worked too hard , and to be so huge . <p> Anna was a second-class member of her mother 's girls ' club . Her mother badgered and threatened her , holding out the promise of new dresses and special treats . As time passed and Anna moved on to the algebra book and school dance world of high school , her mother informed her that they would embark on a special project . It was a warm September morning and Anna 's cornflakes were slowly soaking in their skim milk , her wool skirt making her legs itch . Patrice was buttering a piece of toast . She looked over at Anna with discomfort , folded the bread in half , and left the room . <p> " Project ? " Anna asked . <p> " Yes , " said her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale crystal of the early morning sun exposed the true age of the green linoleum floor . <p> " Now that you 're a young lady , it 's time to get rid of all that baby fat . You 'd be so pretty if you would just use some self-control . So you and I will work at it , and we 'll diet together . " <p> Anna felt her face grow warm , and she put down her spoon , her appetite vanishing . Her mother put the coffee cup in the cupboard , the cheap white china gleaming against the bright pattern of the shelf paper . Dime store frills abounded in the kitchen , the room Anna hated in the house . A pot full of plastic flowers sat on the shelf above the sink , next to the loud clock that ticked off every second spent there . Her mother clutched the back of a kitchen chair , her chewed , painted nails curling around the edge . <p> " Women always have to keep their figures , " she said . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd prefer you 'd learn it sooner than later . I 've let things go long enough . This will be a new version of you . Is n't that exciting ? " She beamed at Anna and turned to finish getting ready for work . " I think this will be fun , do n't you ? " <p> At the dinner table , her mother would dip into her meal of cottage cheese and crackers with a smile , exclaiming how slimming foods could be so delicious . Anna dutifully ate the halved pears and melba toast , and she got on the scale after her mother each morning , recording her weight on a wall chart in the bathroom . When in June she fit into a graduation dress that was acceptable , one even Patrice could fit into , her mother wept . <p> Anna went far away to college , to the edge of the continent , to Boston . Coming home for Christmas that first winter , her mother wept again , seeing she had become a size larger than when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spring break . <p> She stayed away , communicating through a voice on the phone and letters , sending pictures rarely . As it became clear she would not come home to them , her family began to come to her , her sisters for a few days in the summer and her mother early in the new year . Every January Anna faced with dread the end of the holidays , when her mother would ask sweetly what resolutions she had made for the coming year . <p> Walking through the security barriers , Anna 's mother tucked a romance novel into her carry-on bag . Her eyes narrowed as she looked Anna over from head to toe . But Anna resolutely smiled , trying not to let her ten-year-old self surface . <p> It was over dinner that her mother actually broached the subject . " I know you think now , with your fancy job and all , you can let yourself go , but that 's just not the case . I brought a wonderful new diet you can try . My friend Marge went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so easy . " <p> Anna looked at her menu and thought about what to say . She knew her mother was looking at her expectantly . She could see the face of the woman who had stared her down in dressing rooms , who had chewed mouthfuls of cottage cheese with a smile on her face . <p> " Mom , things have changed a lot in the past few years , " she began tentatively . " I 've changed . I do n't want to go on another diet . It just does n't seem to work . I think you 're stuck with me the way I am . " <p> She swallowed the lump in her throat and smiled . <p> Her mother looked back at her , the lines in her face deepening in the soft candlelight . She looked puzzled and shut her menu , and then reached over to pat Anna 's hand . <p> " I 'll leave it with you anyway , in case you change your mind . Now , did I tell you where Marge and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother 's words always attacked her later , without warning , as Anna looked into a shop window and saw herself reflected back , or when she was about to walk into a room crowded with strangers . Words that stung still , but that were no longer poisonous or deadly . As a child , she could not comprehend what she now knew : that her mother was a bitter and disappointed woman , that the problem was not Anna 's . <p> Anna realized Sam was smiling up at her , wiping sleep away from his eyes . <p> " Hiya , " he said in a foggy voice . " How 'd it go ? " <p> " Fine , really . Better than I expected . " <p> " I 'm glad . " <p> She sat down on the bed next to him , and he took her into his arms , stroking her hair . <p> " You look like you 've had enough until next year , " he said . <p> Anna did n't reply , feeling as if she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips to his bare chest . <p> Sam stroked the soft flesh under her chin , and drew her mouth to meet his . Reaching to shut off the bedside lamp , he stopped her , clasping her hand tight in his . Anna thought of the refuge of the silky darkness , but Sam was undoing the back of her dress , pushing it off her shoulder . She thought of the flickering fluorescent lights of all those dressing rooms . She thought of her mother 's disapproving eyes , squinting and darting . Sam was murmuring in her ear , and they were lying on the bed together in the soft glow of the lamp . The picture of herself in the shop window dissolved , and the light burned on into the night . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p>
