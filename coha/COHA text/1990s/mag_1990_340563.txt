Green Creams <P> The Body Shop takes its creams and lotions from nature , but nature does n't suffer . Anita Roddick , founder of the 14-year-old British cosmetic company , makes sure of that . She runs the manufacturing and retail firm ( which has branches in 37 countries ) as a paradigm of planet-friendly practices . <P> " The environmental movement has got to re-educate people , " says Roddick , 47 . <P> Body Shop 's 300 products derive mainly from plants and are not tested on animals . They come in simple plastic bottles that can be taken back to any one of its 464 stores , most of them franchises , for a discount on the next purchase . The shops boast distinctive wood decoration , but endangered tropical hardwoods are banned . Store-window displays protest the slaughter of whales and the dumping of wastes in the North Sea , and leaflets urge customers to help save the ozone layer . Roddick insists that her stores use recycled paper for everything from stationery to toilet tissue . <P> She openly declares that following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But respecting the environment has proved no barrier to success . Last year Body Shop sales jumped nearly 60% , to $90 million , earning Roddick the title of Britain 's Retailer of the Year . <P> Cash for Trash <P> A dilapidated garage in New York City 's South Bronx would not be most people 's idea of an office . But for Michael Schedler and his partners in Bronx 2000 , a nonprofit development corporation , such an unlikely site became the first home eight years ago for a booming business : the R2B2 recycling plant . <P> " R2B2 started as a sexy way to get garbage off the streets , " explains Schedler , 40 , the plant 's chief of operations . The trick was to pay people cash to bring in bottles , cans , newspapers and other trash . Soon , not only were the streets cleaner , but hundreds of the Bronx 's disadvantaged residents had a steady source of income . Today R2B2 has 30 employees and buys about 35 tons of nearly 30 different recyclable materials daily . The plant bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sells them to companies for turning into new products . <P> A New York State law requiring stores to pay refunds on returned bottles and cans has taken away some of R2B2 's business , but the facility , which will earn . nearly $3 million in revenues this year , can not begin to meet the demand for such materials as plastic and glass . Similar trash-taming plants have gone up in numerous cities , including Newark , Miami and Philadelphia .
