The Problem Is Not Wallet , But Will <p> In the spring of 1993 , Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff explained to a group of reporters that America 's quiescent approach to the war in Bosnia would exemplify U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War era because " we certainly do n't have the money " to tackle many international crises . These remarks were later disavowed by Clinton administration spokesmen , but Tarnoff had done nothing more than voice the conventional wisdom established as soon as the Cold War ended . Most often it is said that the United States no longer has the resources that it once devoted to foreign policy . But how can this be ? America is the richest country the world has ever known , and its resources have been expanding . <p> There is no resource problem ; there is a budget problem based on the American public 's failure to reconcile its aversion to taxes with its appetite for benefits . Opinion polls consistently show that Americans prefer Republicans on taxes ( to keep them low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Of course , Americans would rather not admit that federal budget woes arise from greed ; better to blame generosity . Thus polls show that when Americans are asked to estimate the share of the budget devoted to foreign aid , the median response is 15 percent . When they are asked to suggest a proper amount , the median is 5 percent . There is a method in this madness : if foreign aid did consume 15 percent and was cut to 5 , that would mean cutting the budget by 10 percent , which for now would almost bring it into balance . <p> Unfortunately , the share actually spent on U.S. foreign aid amounts to less than one percent ; zeroing it out would scarcely dent the deficit . Indeed , the elimination of all spending related to foreign policy , even including the entire defense budget , would not balance the U.S. budget for long  --  not , that is , if entitlement spending continues on its recent trajectory . THE GREAT MAW <p> The problem will reach new proportions as the baby boom generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years . The Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform , chaired by Senators Robert Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) and John Danforth ( R-Mo. ) , calculated that by 2012 spending on entitlements and interest on the debt combined will exceed federal revenues . Some dissenters say that forecast , despite its use of official budget projections , is overly optimistic . It was made before the new Republican majority in Congress , breaking a taboo , began trying to restrain the growth rate of Medicare , Medicaid , and welfare . It was also , however , before the Republican majority began cutting taxes . <p> The effect of the explosion in entitlements can be readily seen from the historical tables of outlays that accompany fine president 's fiscal year 1996 budget , which used fiscal year 1962 , the first budget year of the Kennedy administration , as a base line . Discretionary spending then made up about two thirds of the budget . Today it makes up about one third . Entitlements , which then were about a quarter of expenditures , today are about half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent annually from about 6 percent . <p> Among entitlements , the share devoted to means-tested programs  --  that is , those aimed at the poor  --  has grown the fastest , more than tripling in this 30-plus year span , while the share spent on Social Security and other entitlements that are not means-tested has almost doubled . <p> This may help explain the clamor for welfare reform . But despite the different growth rates , non-means-tested entitlements  --  that is , benefits that go mostly to the middle class  --  are still more than three times as large a share of entitlements as spending on means-tested ones . <p> That shows where the budget dollars have ended up . But where have they been flowing from ? The shrinkage in the discretionary share of the budget pie has come entirely at the expense of foreign policy . Foreign policy spending  --  defense , foreign aid , diplomacy , and other international programs  --  used to dwarf domestic discretionary spending , but today it is just barely larger . Its share of the budget has fallen by more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ebbed and flowed during this period . Its share climbed during the Kennedy-Johnson and Nixon-Ford years , plateaued under Carter , fell under Reagan , and crept upward under Bush . In real terms , domestic discretionary spending is now somewhat higher than it was in 1962 , although the Clinton budget calls for decreases in the years ahead . <p> The trend of diminishing spending on foreign policy has accelerated since the end of the Cold War . Foreign policy spending absorbed about to percent of GDP during the Kennedy years , about 7 percent during the Reagan years , and 4.5 percent in 1994. 1 In 1995 it was scheduled to drop to 4.2 percent and in 1996 to 3.8 percent , with further decreases as far as the projections reach . Since 1989 , the year the Soviet empire dissolved , foreign policy spending as a share of GDP has fallen by more than a third . Defense spending in the first five budget years after the Cold War was $350 billion below the amount projected in the last of the Cold War budgets . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . But it came and went virtually unnoticed , sucked into the great maw of entitlements . Further foreign policy cuts are coming . Although criticizing Clinton 's defense cuts , the Republican majority has not restored defense spending . It would merely hold defense spending steady , without even matching inflation . At the same time , Republicans in Congress propose to cut the nonmilitary side of foreign policy  --  diplomacy , foreign aid , broadcasting , and support for international organizations  --  by one third in nominal dollars , far more once inflation takes its bite . None of these cuts , however , will solve the long-term budget problem . That can only be solved through significant cuts in entitlements , especially those that are not means-tested . THE DAMAGE DONE <p> While further cuts in foreign policy accounts will not solve the budget problems , they may greatly damage the instruments of American statesmanship . For example , the same week that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin took himself out of the running for president , thus increasing the chances that extreme nationalists or unrepentant communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut the already shrunken budget of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty so deeply that their operations would be crippled and might have to shut down entirely . In countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland , where democratic institutions continue to gain strength , RFE broadcasting has been superseded by domestic news services . In other parts of the former Soviet empire , most importantly Russia itself , a free press is far from established and democracy and freedom hang in the balance . Governments still own most of the media there and often try to control the content of news , while much of the independent media is still learning Western standards of journalistic objectivity . Nonetheless , since the Cold War ended , budget has dropped by two thirds , to $75 million from $225 million , hardly enough to maintain operations suited to the new geopolitical realities . If the Senate 's position withstands the current fiscal year 's baroque appropriations process , the $75 million would be cut to $29 million . <p> Likewise , although the president and congressional leaders have for several years agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage liberalization in China , Indochina , and North Korea , that project has withered on the vine for want of the $25 million it would take to launch it . The broadcasting of Voice of America , whose raison d'etre , unlike that of RFE/RL , was not drastically affected by the end of the Cold War , has also absorbed sharp budget cuts , forcing it to curtail news gathering , reduce its airtime , and eliminate some language services . Even high-priority targets of the post-Cold War era , such as the Islamic world , have felt the effect of the budget ax . The U.S. Information Agency has had to eliminate nearly 900 positions , or about ten percent of its personnel , in the last three years , and another ten percent will be cut this year . The State Department and the National Endowment for Democracy have also been slashed . <p> The State Department was forced to close 22 of some 275 foreign posts from 1992 through 1994 and schedule 19 more for closing since then , although a few of them have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pivotal countries such as Egypt , Turkey , Mexico , Thailand , Nigeria , Venezuela , Brazil , and Indonesia . Moreover , the United States has fallen about $1.25 billion behind on its U.N . obligations , an amount that constituted more than half of the unpaid obligations of all U.N . members as of the end of 1995 . One hardly needs to be an admirer of the United Nations to believe that it is foolish for the United States , the world 's richest and most powerful country , to appear a piker . <p> The lion 's share of foreign policy spending goes to defense . But defense is being shortchanged too . In the last Reagan years , defense spending began to fall . The reductions were accelerated during the early years of the Bush administration and again when the Soviet Union collapsed . As a presidential candidate , Bill Clinton promised further defense reductions of $60 billion over five years . Once in office , however , Clinton opted for a cut of $120 billion . After the Republican congressional election victory of 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , Clinton proposed to restore $25 billion , although the budk of that was penciled in for the years 1999 and 2000 , for which the figures are notional . <p> While concerns about military readiness have received the most publicity , the drastic economies in the defense budget have been in modernization , the procurement of new weapons and equipment . Procurement has received a diminished share of a diminished defense budget . William Kaufman of the Brookings Institution calculates that while 27 cents out of each defense dollar has gone to procurement in the past , under Clinton that number has fallen to 17 cents . This has been possible because the services have been living off the large inventories stockpiled during the Reagan military buildup . But knowledgeable observers from across the political spectrum agree that the reserve of materiel is now largely exhausted and procurement will have to rise sharply . Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe says that the U.S. military needs to be " recapitalized . " But with the total defense budget not projected to increase in real terms , where will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offsetting reductions in force size ( already reduced by a third ) , compensation ( which is essential to an all-volunteer force ) , readiness , or research and development . <p> Stopping the shriveling of the military and peaceful instruments of U.S. foreign policy will probably mean devoting about four to five percent of GDP to them . This , of course , is a lot of money in absolute terms , but it is modest compared with what the United States spent during the Cold War . Throughout the 1950s and 1960s America spent about ten percent of its GDP on foreign policy , and for much of that time it did so without deficits . For example , during the 11-year span from 1947 through 1957 the country ran a cumulative budget surplus of about $14 billion . The America that made such large sacrifices was much poorer than it is today . The standard of living , measured in constant dollars of per capita income , was about half of what it is now , and the difference showed in various indicators of social well-being . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens on average now receive several more years of schooling and live several years longer . DEEP ENOUGH POCKETS <p> The argument for relentless reductions in foreign policy spending centers on three rationales : economic health , policy priorities , and global politics . All are fallacious . The argument that America risks decline through excessive defense spending is still heard , although it makes even less economic sense than it did during the height of the Reagan buildup , when it first gained credence . America is 15 to 20 percent better off in per capita income than the next richest countries , so even spending 7 percent of its income on foreign policy , as it did under Reagan , would leave its per capita income 10 to 15 percent ahead of that of Japan or Germany , whose economies seem to awe so many . That is a margin that the United States could consume or invest , as it saw fit . <p> Whether the funds spent on defense , foreign aid , or other programs are wasted is subject to political judgment , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economy . There is no correlation between the economic growth rates of nations and their foreign policy expenditures . The Republic of China , for example , boasts the greatest run of economic growth ever recorded , and it is doing so while laboring under a heavy defense burden . More to the point is the U.S. experience . The quarter century from 1948 to 1973 was something of a golden age of economic growth in America : the annual growth of GNP per capita averaged 2.2 percent in real terms , about one third higher than the growth rate before or since . Yet those years were also the era of America 's highest foreign policy spending ( except for the war years ) . Over that quarter century the United States spent roughly ten percent of its GDP on foreign policy . This data is not to suggest that the high rate of foreign policy spending caused the high rate of growth , only that high foreign policy spending is not inherently harmful to the economy . <p> The argument about priorities claims that America should put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . The trouble with this argument is that domestic problems are never solved . Most domestic problems reduce to issues of prosperity , where no known amount is considered enough , or race , where incremental increases in equality and harmony are more likely than any definitive solution . <p> Admittedly , the more America reduces foreign policy expenditures , the more funds will be available for domestic programs or tax cuts . But can liberals argue that a little more spending will solve domestic problems when many of those problems have grown worse even as spending to combat them has increased ? Can conservatives , whose most compelling argument is for renewing moral values , make a coherent case that the nation can achieve moral renewal while renouncing international responsibilities ? The United States defeated Nazism , contained the Soviet empire , and lifted Europe and Japan from the ashes at a time when its standard of living was far inferior to today 's . How different  --  and how terrifying  --  the world would be if the United States had taken the view that it could not shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal goal of foreign policy is not wealth but safety : the peace dividend , someone has aptly remarked , is peace . But safety from what ? The absence of a clear threat , such as Soviet imperialism immediately after World War II , has led to the belittling of foreign policy . Such a circumstance is more like the aftermath of World War I , when the threat was not clear . The Bolsheviks were feared only for the power of their example , not as a force capable of generating an external challenge to America . Nor was Hitler taken seriously until much too late . Where are the threats today ? Certainly a potential threat lies in a Russia that reverts to dictatorship and militarism , a China that grows wealthy and imperious without growing free , and an Islamic world that becomes further infected with virulent extremism and secures weapons of mass destruction . Which of these or other threats will spread ? The point is not to guess , but to recognize that the answer is not foreordained and that the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome . The hope that future Americans can enjoy the generous measure of security of today is worth paying for . If America fails to do so , it will not be because it lacks the resources  --  except perhaps the inner resources of foresight , temperance , compassion , and strength . <p> 1 By foreign policy spending , I mean that comprised within the federal budget categories entitled " national defense , " which includes intelligence , and " international affairs , " which consists of direct foreign aid , the conduct of diplomacy , programs for the exchange of academics , students , scientists , and the like , financing of projects in other countries , and the overseas broadcasting , publishing , and informational activities of the U.S. government . <p> By Joshua Muravchik <p> <p> JOSHUA MURAVCHIK is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
