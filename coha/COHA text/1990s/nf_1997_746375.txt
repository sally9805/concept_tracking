We believe this to be one of the necessary qualifications of a good teacher of physical activities , and therefore plan the professional curriculum to include courses necessary for such training ( Huelster , 1939 , p. 84 ) <p> The " we " in this quote refers to those interested in the problem of training professional students in physical education . The " this " in the quote refers to learning to analyze skills taught in the gymnasium . Perhaps , more significant than the " we " or the " this " is the date of this quote . It has been more than fifty years since this astute observation was made , yet in many cases we are no more advanced in curricular offerings in relation to qualitative analysis of movement than our colleagues of 1939 . Along with the statement regarding the importance of movement analysis , Huelster ( 1939 ) went on to suggest specific ways to integrate movement analysis into the curriculum . <p> In the past 20 years , a number of physical educators have called for the addition of qualitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Armstrong , 1977 ; Hoffman , 1974 , 1977a , b ; Ignico , 1993 ; Morrison &; Harrison , 1985 ) . By qualitative analysis , we mean : " watching a skill performance and deciding how closely the specific movements conform to accepted standards for that skill " ( Morrison &; Reeve , 1988 , p. 291 ) . These authors include in that definition the following factors which are also important to the analysis process : knowledge of the performer , knowledge of the skill , observation , and diagnosis . <p> In spite of these calls for change and our understanding of the importance of qualitative analysis in providing corrective feedback to learners , physical educators have made only sporadic efforts to incorporate this important teaching component in the curriculum . This is evidenced by limited inclusion of the qualitative analysis of movement in many undergraduate programs and courses . Therefore , this article describes two general approaches to instruction , indicates the value of instruction , suggests a learning progression , and suggests ways to integrate qualitative analysis into the university undergraduate physical education curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which physical educators have called for the inclusion of qualitative analysis in the undergraduate curriculum , researchers have provided a body of information on which to develop instructional approaches to the qualitative analysis of movement . Two general instructional approaches to qualitative analysis have arisen from the research : video-based and concept-based . <p> The various video-based approaches to instruction ( Gangstead &; Beveridge , 1984 ; Kelly , Walkley &; Tarrant , 1988 ; Morrison &; Harrison , 1985 ; Wilkinson , 1991 ) share a number of features and differ in others . All these approaches are sport-specific , and skill-based . They contain performance examples of either elementary , junior high or high school students in natural settings . Each specific sports skill is broken down into its critical features and their sequences . The producers of the videos derived the skill components and their sequences for the different instructional modes from biomechanics and motor development literature ; they also consulted with movement specialists . Feedback in each case is provided during instruction to help the students develop their analysis abilities . <p> Differences in these videos include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prompts as a part of instruction , and perceptual guidance . The shortest instructional approach ( Morrison &; Harrison , 1985 ) used only regular speed for skill examples , while the interactive video approach of Kelly , et al . ( 1988 ) used multiple speeds varying from stop action to regular . The other two methods of instruction also employ a variety of different speeds . <p> Like the viewing speed of the presentation , the length of instruction varies . Morrison and Harrison ( 1985 ) use 42 minutes to present their information , whereas Wilkinson ( 1991 ) uses three 18 minute segments for video instruction . Gangstead and Beveridge ( 1984 ) take a 10-week time period for their method of education . Kelly , et al . ( 1988 ) have no finite time limit . The video-disk can be used until the information has been mastered . Prompts ( hints or clues to help with analysis ) are a part of the Gangstead and Beveridge ( 1984 ) and Wilkinson ( 1991 ) instructional methodologies but are not a part of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gangstead and Beveridge ( 1984 ) employ a perceptual model to guide analysis . This model is a temporal-spatial model designed to focus the learner on specified body parts at specific times during the performance . Conceptual Approaches to Instruction <p> While Kelly et al . ( 1988 ) and Morrison and Harrison ( 1985 ) base their instructional formats solely on videos , both Gangstead and Beveridge ( 1984 ) and Wilkinson ( 1991 ) cross over into the conceptual approach to qualitative analysis . The concept-based approach relies on knowledge of the **29;563;TOOLONG principles underlying the movements to be analyzed ( McPherson , 1988 ; Nielsen &; Beauchamp , 1992 ; Satern , Coleman &; Matsakis , 1991 ) . Examples of concepts are : weight transfer , opposition , and stability . These concepts serve as the knowledge base for students and build a resource from which to make movement analysis decisions . Instead of the instructor telling students what is right or wrong in a performance , students in a conceptual approach make many of these decisions themselves . Further , the teacher expects them to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge of **31;624;TOOLONG principles is a difference between the conceptual approach and the video only approaches ; there are other differences as well . The conceptual approach takes more time and requires the direct intervention of an instructor . The approach is more comprehensive and generally includes information on how to observe movement in the instructional setting . The last key difference is that the conceptual approach also emphasizes remediation and corrective feedback . Value of Instruction <p> Investigators have examined qualitative analysis continuously for about 20 years , and research seems to indicate the value of such instruction . Subjects have demonstrated significantly improved skill knowledge and analysis performance after instruction . <p> A brief summary of the research findings indicates that : Specific instruction leads to an improvement in the ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect performances ( Gangstead &; Beveridge , 1984 ; Hoffman &; Armstrong , 1975 ; Kniffin , 1985 ) . Information processing plays an important part in analysis ( Morrison &; Reeve , 1989 ; Morrison &; Reeve , 1992 ) . Correct and incorrect performance examples lead to improvements in qualitative analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Instructors can teach qualitative analysis using several methods ( Bayless , 1980 ; Knudson , Morrison , &; Reeve , 1991 ; Gangstead &; Beveridge , 1984 ) . Gains in score ( measured from pretest to posttest ) are about 5 to 7% ( Hoffman &; Armstrong , 1975 ; Knudson , Morrison , &; Reeve , 1991 ; Morrison &; Reeve , 1992 ) . Laboratory qualitative analysis instruction is beneficial in developing classroom teaching skills ( Kniffin , 1985 ) . Students can retain the ability to analyze skills over a period of time , although teachers should continue to practice qualitative analysis to ensure retention ( Morrison , 1994 ; Morrison &; Harrison , 1985 ) . <p> Perhaps the most encouraging qualitative analysis research results come from two studies which demonstrated that educators who used courses structured to teach qualitative analysis were successful in helping students develop abilities used in a teaching situation . Kniffin 's ( 1985 ) subjects improved from pretest to posttest and could generalize qualitative analysis to the real classroom setting with middle school students . Satern , Coleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at observing movement and giving corrective and evaluative feedback after a training program . They gave higher percentages of corrective and evaluative feedback as a result of their qualitative analysis instruction experiences . Although Eckrich , Widule , Shrader , and Mayer ( 1994 ) have challenged these results , they still indicate the potential for qualitative analysis instruction . <p> If our graduates are to have qualitative analysis abilities , instruction in qualitative analysis must be an integral part of the curriculum . Since qualitative analysis is related to many of the classes we teach at the college level , it should be woven like a thread through the whole fabric of the undergraduate curriculum . The next logical step in producing students who can analyze movement qualitatively is the development of a systematic approach to qualitative analysis in the undergraduate physical education curriculum . Although Huelster ( 1939 ) called for this integration , she had only limited suggestions on how this should be done . We suggest a more in-depth approach . A Model for Integration <p> DePauw and Goc Karp ( 1989 ; 1994 ) proposed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived from the integration of adapted physical education into a university curriculum . The focal point of this approach is the adapted physical education class and the adapted physical education specialist . The authors go on to specify ways to use materials and knowledge in other curricular offerings . <p> A physical education faculty that wish to develop qualitative analysis ability in their graduates could mimic the approach suggested by DePauw and Goc Karp ( 1989 ) . Figure I shows how the DePauw/Goc Karp model ( 1989 ) might be adapted for qualitative analysis . <p> A beginning suggestion for implementing a curriculum that integrates qualitative analysis is to designate a faculty member as the qualitative analysis specialist , similar to the adapted specialist in the DePauw/Goc Karp ( 1989 ) model . This faculty member should logically be chosen from one of the subdisciplines that have contributed most to the development of qualitative analysis : pedagogy , motor learning , motor development , and kinesiology/biomechanics . Further , this person should have a strong commitment to the area and an intimate knowledge of how the practitioner will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be explicitly charged with helping other instructors develop specific teaching materials and strategies suited to the classes they teach so that qualitative analysis can become an integral part of each class . <p> Another recommendation for implementing this model is to determine as a faculty a progression of learning experiences for qualitative analysis in the undergraduate curriculum . As each undergraduate curriculum is different , our suggested progression is very general . The three levels we propose are : introduction to qualitative analysis , development of qualitative materials and methods related to subdisciplines , and the application of qualitative analysis in the teaching situation . Classes such as motor learning , motor development , elementary/secondary methods , activity classes , tests and measurements , and kinesiology/biomechanics could all add a qualitative analysis aspect . Class Progression and Content <p> The introduction to qualitative analysis could occur in activity classes . Activity classes could use qualitative analysis by providing opportunities for students to analyze videotapes of school children and each other performing the skills taught in the class . As activity classes are usually taken early in the major , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the importance and complexities of qualitative analysis . Basic ideas such as the break-down of movements into critical features and a structured observation environment can be presented . Comparison could be made for qualitative analysis ability before and after instruction for students in these classes . <p> Development of qualitative analysis materials and knowledge could emerge from the following three courses : tests and measurements , biomechanics/kinesiology , and motor learning . Teachers should include both qualitative and quantitative analysis in tests and measurements classes . For example , technique assessment of how skills are performed , a component of the total evaluation process , must be qualitative ( Dunham , 1986 ; Ignaco , 1993 ; Reeve &; Morrison , 1986 ) . Grades assigned for the proper achievement of technique must be done qualitatively . Students in tests and measurements classes could observe actual school physical education classes or videotapes of these classes and practice assigning grades for skill performance techniques . <p> Biomechanics/kinesiology classes serve as a natural base for qualitative analysis . It is from these classes that students can learn to derive the critical features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a certain extent . qualitative analysis could become a part of the requirements of these classes . In a single class , students in non-teacher preparation tracks might analyze gait , jogging and lifetime skills , while pedagogy students might focus on various sports skills , or separate sections could be offered for students in each track . Students could work in realtime analysis or videotape analysis and try to draw positions of body parts and bodies at various parts of skill performance . This could help increase their awareness of general movement patterns . Computers could help with this process through digitizing to determine the accuracy of drawings . <p> Motor learning is another course in the undergraduate curriculum that has a natural link to qualitative analysis . This link is directly related to feedback and information processing . Since feedback related to motor skill learning is usually based on observing movement , and since qualitative analysis is the foundation of observation , students must understand qualitative analysis in order to understand feedback . Similarly , because the purpose of information processing to make sense out of various stimuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , an understanding of the role of information processing is fundamental to qualitative analysis . <p> The following three classes can serve as practical application settings as well as add to the knowledge side of analysis : motor development , elementary and secondary methods , and adapted physical education . The motor development class could qualitatively explore the developmental changes in motor patterns using slides , videotape analysis , and practicum experiences . Using videotapes or slides direct comparisons could be made between skill performance at different ages for the same subjects . This class can also serve for the exploration of movement evaluation models such as the one proposed by Roberton and Halverson ( 1984 ) . <p> Elementary and secondary methods classes are also natural places to integrate qualitative analysis in the undergraduate curriculum . In many cases , these classes summarize all other curricular offerings and show how various physical education curriculum classes contribute to the teaching environment . Methods classes allow students to see how qualitative analysis is important to their activities in the classroom . This importance can be demonstrated by peer teaching situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Klesius and Bowers ( 1990 ) demonstrated that instructors can use interactive video-disks in adapted physical education under-graduate classes in order to help students learn about movement differences in special populations . Like other methods classes , adapted physical education provides an excellent opportunity to apply qualitative analysis in the teaching environment . Again , feedback and real life grade assignment could be practiced as part of these classes . <p> A curricular addition that should be foremost in the minds of university faculty is a qualitative analysis of movement class separate from all other classes . This class is ideally where the qualitative analysis specialist on the faculty would be most helpful . Some universities already offer these classes . If this class is in place , it can serve to integrate knowledge from other subdisciplinary classes and to apply qualitative analysis knowledge . The following list includes some of the activities and content from one such class : Movement observation . Vision and its contribution to analysis . Perception and its role in analysis . Writing a clear , concise analysis of skills . Feedback and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginners . Drawing specific movements in skills . Models of analysis . Imagery activities for analysis . Conclusion <p> The list of activities and content from the qualitative analysis class , along with suggestions for the other physical education classes , show plenty of opportunities to integrate qualitative analysis into specific classes as well as into the physical education curriculum in general . The reported research on qualitative analysis supports the soundness of these approaches in developing qualitative analysis abilities in our undergraduates . The evidence also warrants the development of a graduate class in the qualitative analysis of movement , and such a class should be given serious consideration in any discussions relating to curricular changes in the graduate physical education curriculum . <p> The approaches presented here illustrate how qualitative analysis can be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum . The integration process based on the above suggestions allows for flexibility in the implementation of the latest knowledge . Faculty can work together to address how curriculum changes can be achieved to integrate qualitative analysis into the whole undergraduate curriculum or individual classes . <p> Curricular changes are often slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessary if we are to advance as a discipline . We need to continue advancing our discipline by using our knowledge to produce better teachers . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
