Roger Manly 's world and Lucy 's would probably never have overlapped if the great actress Colleen Dewhurst , shortly before her death , had not signed for a national tour of dramatic readings , including much poetry by women . Roger had no professional connection with the tour , but he had no trouble getting himself invited to the party that followed the inaugural performance . Roger 's father , now retired , had been a Broadway lawyer , an occasional angel , and Colleen Dewhurst had been at the very top of his list of great ladies of the stage . Roger had been introduced to her any number of times over the years , but had always found himself tongue-tied , intimidated , as he very rarely was , by the sheer physical force of her presence . As she got older , heavier , gray-haired , her voice deepened and she became more overwhelming than ever , constantly outdistancing Roger 's advancing maturity . He had been twenty-nine or thirty at the date of this party , had earned a good reputation , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made no difference . <p> " I loved the whole evening , " he told Colleen , " especially the Emily Dickinson and that excerpt-what was it from , A Death in the Family ? - and there was that woman 's poetry that pretended to have been written by a child . I do n't know her work , and it was fascinating . " <p> " Lucy North , " Colleen rumbled , " she 's here . Let me introduce you . " <p> And that 's how it started , under the aegis of the great Dewhurst , and a sense of that voice , its deep emotionality , the memories it stirred not only of the great O'Neill plays captured on record , but of conversations at my own childhood dinner table , wrapping Lucy and me in some special fabric of intimacy . It hardly hurt , of course , that I had praised her poetry before I knew who she was or that she was there , and it helped too , that Colleen had presented me as an old and intimate friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability ever to rise to the occasion . <p> " I love her and she terrifies me , " I confessed to Lucy . " It must be extraordinary to hear your poems being done by her . Not that your poems are n't pretty extraordinary anyway , but to hear them done . . . " I trailed away , I think , into embarrassed silence , found myself as intimidated by this young woman's-she was at most twenty-fiveserenity as I was by Colleen 's expansiveness . <p> " I invent my childhood , " Lucy said quietly . " Colleen seems to reach right back into herself and pick it up , right there , no fumbling . She 's what ? -sixty-something ? And then she 's eight years old ; you can see the eight-year-old right there in her face and body . I do n't know how she does it . I asked her and she said it 's just there . She says it 's as though all the years of her life are in a circle around her , and she has the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said it was n't her acting training , that only trained her to use the ability , but the ability was always there . I do n't know that I 've ever met anybody I envied more . To know what has happened , to remember , not to be ashamed . To remember because you are not ashamed . " <p> " My parents saw her in O'Neill 's Moon for the Misbegotten , when she was probably thirty-five or forty , and a big woman already , playing the servant , who 's also supposed to be big , but in her early twenties , and my parents swore that Colleen 's body , when she mopped the floor or did housework , had the suppleness and grace of a teenager ; they could not imagine how a mature woman could so perfectly become a girl . " <p> I realize I have slipped into the first person in describing my first meeting with Lucy , and there 's no reason for me not to stay there-I suspect that any illusion of distance or objectivity I might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie . I was never distant or objective when Lucy was concerned . I was always alert , focused , filled to the brim of myself with my consciousness of her . Is that love ? It must be , this heightening of consciousness apart from and even beyond touch . I remember the first time our eyes met better than I can recall the first time we kissed or made love . It was her consciousness of everything , of me , the world , herself-that was the great gift Lucy brought me , not her body . Perhaps that was a warning I should have heeded . When I touched her , it was not her body that responded , or that was not the primary response ; it was her consciousness of being touched . It was as though I were in the presence of an extraordinary light that threw itself on whatever it touched or that touched it , a clarity , a luminescence . No one could imagine Lucy losing herself in sensuality ; the sensuality was absorbed and made luminous , became her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation-in a milieu that was anything but , that flashed and fulminated with theatrical temperaments-interesting enough to capture and hold Lucy 's attention . I could n't just go on taking her to show business parties as though I were a tourist guide , her passport to the rich and famous . But I soon discovered that it was the most prosaic parts of myself that Lucy liked best and found most attractive . Perhaps I misstate myself when I say prosaic . The world , families , have changed so radically that my relation to my parents , theirs to each other , may have something more rare and fabulous about it than I instinctively credit ; I may have been anachronistic in my " normality . " <p> Lucy , who said " I was born at seventeen , my life began when I got to Vassar , " never told me outright what she felt about my parents . She scarcely ever spoke about her own parents , her childhood in a " tiny town in New Hampshire , a township really because it was too small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school had graduating classes of seventy or eighty kids . I got to visit Boston once when I was a senior , that was my first real city , but that did n't terrify me the way New York did the first time I came down from Poughkeepsie . There was sky in Boston , the buildings were mostly old and unambitious . But New York ! After my first visit , it must have been months before I risked a second trip . And then , of course , I became addicted , decided it was where I had always belonged . " <p> That 's a cut-and-paste memory . Lucy certainly did n't tell that much the first or even the fifth time we met . She presented an odd combination of openness and reticence . I never quite understood , not even after years of marriage , after our two children , whether it was the important or unimportant things she kept to herself , dismissed as irrelevant or guarded behind invisible walls . Did the past matter to her outside of its uses in her poetry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mattered ? I never unriddled Lucy ; perhaps that 's why I remained so blindly loving for so long . <p> I think my prosaic virtue in Lucy 's eyes-what made me , I suppose , a mystery and a riddle to her too-was how dearly I loved and admired my parents , how I liked them and their life , our lives together as a family , so well that I chose not to leave New York to go to college , got my undergraduate degree from Columbia , half an hour 's brisk walk uptown . I had gone on living at home even though my parents could easily have afforded to send me anywhere in the country or even abroad for that matter , if I had been so inclined . <p> Not that my parents were such extraordinary people . My father had gotten his law degree just after the end of the Second World War and had become involved in the theater during the fat Truman and Eisenhower years , before anybody began calling Broadway " the fabulous invalid . " My father loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His earning a living at it seemed almost incidental , a fortuitous side-effect . My mother had been a singer and dancer , a " gypsy , " who had become a theatrical agent when she reached her late twenties and her brief career was showing signs of faltering . " It was n't just that I was n't getting cast , " she used to say , " but I was n't even making most of the call-backs . That was handwriting on the wall a blind man could read , even a blind chorus girl . " <p> In addition to being successful as a lawyer and agent , my parents became judicious backers of new Broadway shows , on David Merrick 's and Kermit Bloomgarden 's A lists . They moved into the huge Riverside Drive apartment shortly before my sister was born , a year ahead of me , both of us late kids , and bought the apartment when the building went co-op in the seventies . Theater memorabilia , including furniture and props that should have been destroyed when the show came down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would I want to go away to college , " I asked Lucy rhetorically , " when Elia Kazan and Nancy Walker and Richard Rodgers and Truman Capote might be dinner guests or drop in for a drink after the show ? I had tickets for everything , was welcome backstage . You ca n't imagine what Broadway was like when I was a kid . The English imports were n't overwhelming the native product . The musicals were originals not revivals and the singers did n't need to be miked . My parents probably hoped I 'd be some kind of genius performer . My sister and I had singing and dancing and God knows what lessons from the time we were three or four . I still know all the basic tap routines , can still play piano , still sing on tune . But we turned out not to be Shirley Temple or Mickey Rooney or even very good at any of it , and our parents loved us anyway . " <p> Lucy impressed my parents , as she had impressed me , with that intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and reaction . My parents were outgoing and spontaneous people , not given to reflection or introspection-the showy immediacy of Broadway was their vernacular . They were struck by Lucy 's different style of immediacy , a reaction followed by a tiny pause , as though there were two Lucys , one reacting to the other 's reaction . My parents , before they thought to ask Lucy her religion , hardly an important subject in their circle , asked her if she 'd ever been a nun , a remarkable question really . What they had caught was her perpetual quality of self-examination . It was a quality that a mystic or perhaps a person who feared he was going mad might have , the style of a recovering addict , examining and resisting each new moment of temptation as it arose . <p> Lucy , who had declined scholarships to graduate school , had come to New York after Vassar and taken a series of jobs that had nothing to do with her status as a published and minor-award-winning poet . She fell in with a young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fringes of the Village , all of them grimly housed in tenements or romantically decaying row houses . I think she was delighted when my parents suggested we live in the apartment with them when we got married , or even before , if we liked . " We have rooms to spare , " they said , " room for you to start your own family in . " Lucy adapted so easily to living with us , fit in so naturally , that it was hard for me to believe , depraved as it sounds , that I was n't marrying my sister , someone who had always been part of our family . <p> By the time our first boy , Raphael , was born my father had turned all his practice over to me , and my parents were spending most of their time in their second home , a restored farmhouse in Roxbury , Connecticut , where many theater people they knew had established themselves . " It 's a chance to read and think and look at trees , " my father said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I probably have left to be philosophical in . " <p> Lucy gave up her makeshift jobs when we got married and devoted herself to her poetry and then to the children . She did readings occasionally , went to a few conferences , collected the occasional prize , but was content to live a quiet and domestic life . What she liked best , her greatest treat , was to take the boys-Jasper arrived eighteen months after Ray-to Connecticut and spend a weekend or even a whole week there with my parents . Lucy had grown up in rural New Hampshire , and although she claimed to love New York City above all places , she roamed those second- or third-growth woods with joy , could name trees and plants and birds , even weeds and insects , with a facility that defied belief . I got a vision of how intensely lonely a child she must have been to have learned so much , so many names , of the non-human world that surrounded her . <p> My feeling about her lonely childhood was confirmed or reinforced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by how rarely she saw or even telephoned them , and by how distant she was from her siblings , never telling me about their marriages or divorces or children , never speaking to or of them at all from one year to the next . We visited New Hampshire for a few days every year , always around a holiday , Christmas or Thanksgiving or Fourth of July , not an exact pattern , and it seemed to be a matter of pure chance whether one of Lucy 's two sisters or her brother , all with children , showed up for even part of the time . <p> Her parents treated us-I do n't quite know how to capture this-as though we were guests at an extremely expensive New England inn , to be treated with gracious hospitality and the kind of professional warmth that never transgresses the boundaries of polite restraint , never presumes to become too " personal . " It was hard for me to locate a phrase in our conversations with Lucy 's family that could n't have belonged as well to a conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical selves , but never thought to seek deeper contact , not even with their grandchildren , who were permanently baffled , remain baffled I am sure to this day , about the extraordinary contrast between their two sets of grandparents . " Are they really Mommy 's parents ? " Ray asked once . " Do n't they like us ? " <p> Lucy 's parents did not like big cities , had no cultural interests that would draw them to New York and never responded to any of our admittedly rare invitations . They had been unsure about coming to our modest wedding , which Lucy had insisted take place in New York , refusing their offer of a wedding nearer home . They had only agreed at the last minute and with the stipulation that they would stay only for the ceremony and the wedding party immediately afterwards , then drive or fly , I forget which , back up to New Hampshire that very evening . I believe only one of Lucy 's sisters came to the wedding . I met the other sister and brother only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in New Hampshire . Her siblings , and even more surprisingly their children , all had the same qualities of formal reserve as Lucy 's parents . <p> I began to wonder , as I got to know Lucy 's family somewhat better , whether this same shared reserve , this same absence of apparent feeling , had given birth to Lucy 's poetry . I wondered whether her poetry was largely composed of everything that had gone unsaid in her family all the years she was growing up , whether her poetry had been fostered by that silence . I realize how very difficult , potentially disastrous , it is for a non-literary person , a lawyer no less , to whom it is important that words have exact meanings , whose job it is to make sure those meanings are as unambiguous as possible , to venture into the world of poetry where everything is suggestion and shadow , where indefiniteness rules . <p> Lucy wrote poems that seemed to give a child 's impressions in a child 's voice and vocabulary . There were few actual persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical elements of her child 's world took on human or emotional characteristics . It might have been the world of primitive man she was writing about , in which trees and bushes , clouds , rocks , and beyond them , more prosaically , furniture and farm equipment , a cow pasture , hay , a water trough , steaming dung , harbor a secret being . The closest literary equivalent I can cite , her unacknowledged inspiration perhaps , is the great speech in As You Like It that discovers " tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stone , " but perhaps not , as Shakespeare 's Duke did , " good in everything . " <p> What Lucy and I had done , although title of the apartment had been transferred to us when my parents moved definitively to Connecticut , was keep their master bedroom untouched for their occasional weekends in the city , so that the apartment was still my parents ' home . We sacrificed the full river view , but our master bedroom was just as spacious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-was perfectly adequate for the two small boys to share . My parents had already offered on numerous occasions to trade bedrooms or even to take the boys ' room , but Lucy had steadfastly refused the offer . " We have so much space already , " she said . " We live in such luxury . " <p> It was a great shock to me then , an inexplicably great shock , as though I had read and was reacting to meanings I was not yet aware of , when Lucy told me that she thought it was too confining , simply " wrong , " for the two boys to be sharing a bedroom , that she was going to move Jasper into the unoccupied maid 's room off the kitchen . " I do n't want to anticipate anything happening to either of your parents , their bedroom being anything but theirs . I just want each of the boys to have his own space . They are old enough to need that . " <p> How did that get translated in my mind into : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love my own children ? " I found myself , idiotically , not only shocked and angry , feeling betrayed , but I found myself , before I could say a word in response , waiting for her to go on with her rearrangement of our lives and add : " and by the way , do n't you think it 's time we switched to twin beds ? You 've been tossing so much in your sleep lately that it feels like I 'm sleeping in a boat . " Lucy did n't say that , and I had enough self control not to say anything right away that would reveal my distress . My distress seemed so excessive to me anyway that I was reluctant to speak about it , although holding back anything was hardly my style or my family 's style for that matter ; we manufactured drama even as Broadway declined . <p> " Have you asked the boys what they think about it ? " was all I ventured . <p> " I 'll let Jasper choose some of his new furniture , his wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . They 'll be happy to have some breathing room , a door they can close . " <p> They were only three-and-a-half and five years old . " I think they 'll cry , " was all I said . <p> " We 'll see . " <p> It was all so exceptional , Lucy 's telling rather than asking me , her insistence , her certainty , in advance of my reaction , that I did not dare oppose her . Up till now , in all material things-including sex , if that is a material thing-I 'd always had my own way . Lucy had always allowed me control of the facts . It was as though she allowed me to provide the walls inside which she was able freely to live her life of the mind . It was as though my bones and body , in bed next to her at night , provided another , warmer wall , inside of which she continued to live her private secret life . And now she had emerged from that private life with her own notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Perhaps it was because it was in the cultural air , even I think in the air of some serious intellectual journals like the New York Review of Books , my first thoughts were all about the sexual abuse of young children . I flashed to the idea-or rather the idea leaped full blown into my mind , complete with citations and footnotes , like a legal briefthat Lucy herself had been abused or known incest as a child and she was separating the children to keep them out of each other 's beds . And it took me no longer than that thought to arrive at the next one , which was that she was separating the children in order to be able to abuse them sexually and privately herself . I read and re-read all of Lucy 's poems . I was like a trial attorney sifting evidence . Do I find , I asked myself , as the children , our children , grow older , an intensification of that dark force hovering over all of the fields and ponds and barns of her childhood ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they-the developers , the ski chalet people from Manchester and Portland and even Boston had come around offering to buy his dairy farm , he had decided that if they were offering him , whatever it wasfive hundred , a thousand , two thousand dollars an acre-it must be worth double that , and he had developed the property himself , found local builders , plumbers , electricians , everything , had gotten enough money from the bankers he had known all his life to get started and had been so successful with his own property that other dairymen had sold out to him instead of to strangers and had been rewarded with twenty or thirty percent more for their land than those strangers would have given them . A smart , cold man who could have been the profile of a sex abuser , somebody who liked to control everything and everybody around him . <p> I read and re-read Lucy 's poems , but there is no sex there , no explicit sex , unless you count flowers , or trees and shrubs , unless you assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is always between Lucy and me that zone of silent self-regard which could be anything . My family lived by touching each other , the way theater people live ; I kissed my parents , my sister , every day we were home together all my life . I lived wrapped , live wrapped , in this family cocoon of deep affection . I can not imagine how that might turn to vile exploitation of innocence . <p> I am writing this perhaps , I am not sure , for the psychiatrist I intend to see in order to get him to speak to my wife and my children , my wife and children to speak to him ; and because , for myself , when I stare into my wife 's eyes , when I look at her life now , I can feel a form of rage , built I suppose on uncertainty , racing through me . I find myself wanting to shake her , to strike her , to punish her until she confesses what terrible truth she is hiding in her poetry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
