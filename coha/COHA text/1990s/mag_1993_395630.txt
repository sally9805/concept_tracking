I learned very early to associate thundering explosions and raging fires  --  evidence of dreaded bombs  --  with the Birmingham Ku Klux Klan and their confederates . During the late forties , several houses across the street from us were bombed by the KKK to deter Black people from taking up residence on the White side of the street . This was not long after my mother and father purchased a house atop what came to be known as Dynamite Hill . They had received an official letter stating that because the area was not zoned for " Negroes , " we would have to move . My mother wanted to move , but my father 's response was " You ca n't run away from trouble . " Eventually our side of the street was rezoned , but the trouble did not end . The church our family attended was the target of numerous threats and police harassment after an interracial youth group met there several times . But miraculously , in all these episodes of bombings , burnings and threatened violence , no one had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholarship in 1959 to attend a private high school in New York City , thus radically altering the trajectory of my student years , I probably would have been close by at Fisk University in Nashville instead of in France , preparing to study at the Sorbonne , when I learned about the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Alabama , on September 15 , 1963 . If I had not been in France , news would not have been broken to me about the deaths of Carole Robertson , Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins , all 14 years old , and Denise McNair , 11 , in the " objective journalism " of the International Herald Tribune . In tears , I rushed to place a telephone call to my parents , hoping all along that the paper was mistaken . Not Carole , not Cynthia . I did not know Denise McNair and Addie Mae Collins personally , but I cried for them as well , as I experienced profound doubts about my decision to spend that year in a place so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing of girls who were like sisters to me except feel invaded by catastrophe and powerlessness . I was in Biarritz , living among people so far removed from the civil-rights war unfolding in the South that it made little sense to try to express to them how devastated I felt . I wrestled in solitude with my grief , my fear and my rage . Perhaps because there was not even a hint of collective mourning in France  --  accentuated two months later by the pervasive grief with which the news of President Kennedy 's assassination was received  --  I carried around in my head for many years an imagined representation of the bombing 's aftermath that was far more terrifying than any cinematic image of violence I have ever encountered : the fixed eyes of Carole 's and Cynthia 's bloody decapitated heads and their dismembered limbs strewn haphazardly among the dynamited bricks and beams in the front yard of the stately church . I had known Carole Robertson for almost as long as I could remember . Carole was a few years younger than I , my younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , so Carole was more like a baby sister . I remember when Cynthia came to live with the Wesleys , whose backyard was a stone 's throw away from ours  --  just on the other side of the gravel alleyway . Her adoptive parents had always been favorite adults of the children in the neighborhood , so we were all happy when a little girl came to live with them . On the day I found out about the bombing , all I could think about were Carole 's bangs and beautiful long braids and Cynthia 's always impeccably clean face . My own private imagination of what happened that day was so powerful that years would pass before I felt able to listen to the details of my mother 's story . I now live in California , and when my mother , Sallye Bell Davis , came to visit recently , we took some time in the country to talk . She told me that she had heard the explosion from our home in Birmingham , as she had heard so many others over the previous 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sunday school , he told her that something terrible had happened at one of the churches downtown  --  either at Sixth Avenue Baptist Church or Sixteenth Street Baptist Church , which were located within a block of each other . My mother 's immediate response was to call her close friend Alpha Bliss Robertson to ask whether her daughter Carole had gone to Sunday school at Sixteenth Street Baptist and to let the Robertsons know that there was trouble . As soon as they hung up , Mrs. Robertson 's husband , Alvin , rushed out to pick Carole up . Soon Mrs. Robertson , who had initially decided to stay behind , had second thoughts and called to ask my mother to drive her . " When we got to the church , people were screaming , " my mother recalled . " Parents did not know what had happened to their children . It was a horrible day . But it just did n't cross my mind that someone had been killed , much less Carole . " I guess from the time we left the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was trying to be optimistic , but after we sat there outside the hospital for a few minutes and Alvin came out , I knew that the news was not good . I did n't want to hear . " She later discovered that three other girls had been killed : Denise McNair ( whose parents she knew ) , Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins . The time in the country my mother and I spent remembering that terrible day three decades ago  --  Bloody Sunday , she calls it  --  was both healing and frustrating . As we spoke about the girls as we had known them , it occurred to me that the way the memory of that episode persists in popular imagination is deeply problematic . What bothers me most is that their names have been virtually erased : They are inevitably referred to as " the four Black girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing . " Another traumatic moment occurred in 1964 when James Chaney , Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were killed in Mississippi . A decade earlier , Emmett Till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These boys , whose lives were also consumed by racist fury , still have names in our historical memory . Carole , Denise , Addie Mae and Cynthia do not . How many of us remember that they were preparing to speak at the church 's annual Youth Day program ? For most of us , they function abstractly in popular memory as innocent , nameless Black girls ' bodies destroyed by racist hate . This allows us to forget that vast numbers of boys and girls had just recently confronted police commissioner Eugene " Bull " Conner 's high-powered fire hoses and had filled the jails in Birmingham in a way that reenergized the Civil Rights Movement like nothing since the Montgomery Boycott . My mother told me that Carole had just called her a few days earlier to ask for a ride to a meeting of the newly formed organization Friendship and Action . In light of school-desegregation orders , a group of Black and White parents and teachers had established this organization as a way of " letting our children get to know each other " and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carole , my mother said , wanted to get involved and was extremely excited about this meeting . I would like to remember not only the terror that claimed her life and that of her Sunday-school friends , but also the positive lives they claimed for themselves as teenage girls . Along with our memories of that horrible day and what it symbolized , I would also like us all to consider what Carole Robertson , Cynthia Wesley , Addie Mae Collins and Denise McNair might have become .
