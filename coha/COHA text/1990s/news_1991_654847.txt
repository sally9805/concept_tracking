" forget that years of experience have taught us what needs to be done in order to save the lives of many thousands of babies each year . We must be certain that the scarce dollars allocated for the new initiative are spent on proven solutions , examples of which are mentioned in the editorial : basic prenatal care , nutritional guidance , and counseling of pregnant women . The March of Dimes believes that the best way to do this is not to create yet more demonstration projects , but to build creatively on existing programs , such as the Community and Migrant Health Centers program , the Maternal and Child Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Corps . We are grateful that both the Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan and Congress believe so strongly in the need for a new effort to save the 40,000 infants in this country who die each year before their first birthday . We believe that the present initiative will ultimately be broadened if the issue of infant mortality remains a top priority until the problem is eradicated once and for all . Jennifer L.

And coordinating technology-export policies with Europe and Japan - commercial competitors of the US as well as security allies - requires constant policing . Also , a watchdog system designed for East-West trade must be adapted to monitor North-South trade . With the breakup of the Soviet bloc , the so-called COCOM controls on technology sales to Eastern European countries are being loosened . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the third world . Countries like Brazil and India are becoming leading weapons suppliers to the third world , including countries that could threaten Western interests . The US must be as vigilant in controlling dual-use transfers to these emerging high-tech arsenals as it has been in controlling such sales to former Warsaw Pact nations . The trick is to protect US security concerns without unduly narrowing the global market for American technology . A balance can be struck - although export advocates will always believe the controls are too rigid , and those primarily concerned about security will regard the licensing procedures as too loose . The challenge is getting more difficult , as the number of nations engaged in high-tech trade increases . Meeting it must remain a top US priority . e of why the Kurdish uprising in northern Iraq failed . The Kurds had been unable to establish order in the regions they held . There was no regularized form of cooperation among the clans . They did not know how to operate the tanks , planes , and helicopters they seized from the Iraqi military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had also thought the world and America would support the Kurds . That America had until recently supported them against Saddam , encouraging them to revolt , was something the Kurds fighting to live on this high mountain peak spoke of carefully , sometimes in anger , sometimes in a whisper . Why this support was cut off was another question , one acquiring a dimension of mystery . In these high plateaus where to avoid death by starvation , people leap at each other 's throats as they storm trucks distributing bread , you immediately perceive when these questions are asked how profoundly abandoned the Kurds feel . The pitiless rain that gave no pause during the first four days of their flight made most of them feel the whole world , and God , had forgotten the Kurds . During the journey to these camps on the Turkish-Iraqi border , in a Kurdish grocer 's shop at a town called Sirnak whose population is mostly Kurdish , I saw this sign on the wall : " May God grant you twofold whatever you wish for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is an ominous sign . l reach , to educate the public in democratic processes , and guarantee pluralism and open competition for the next elections . Conversely , communist leaders must be pressed firmly against the wall and told that the free world demands civilized treatment of their citizens , otherwise no major credits will be forthcoming and no international institutions will open their doors to Tirana . The victory signs that greet all foreign visitors to Albania will then symbolize the successful construction of democracy , and not just popular yearnings for freedom . cy was lifted last summer . Repeal of the Population Registration and Group Areas Act is the only provision of the CAAA that has not been fulfilled . However , the law also does not require that it be met for repeal of punitive measures , as long as all other conditions have been satisfied . Still , progress has been made : In March , President De Klerk submitted legislation to the South African parliament that would not only abolish the Group Areas Act ( 1936 ) , but also the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land Act ( 1936 ) , and the Black Community and Development Act ( 1984 ) . Repeal of the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act is expected this summer . Bush should not fall prey to ANC strategies for moving the " goal posts . " To do so at this late stage would not only be blatantly unfair , but would also needlessly bring greater economic hardship to black South Africans and dim the prospects for continued political and economic reform . , " I said , doubting it . Then I realized I needed to grow some new legs , here . Who had torn them off ? The government ? The village ? That did n't matter . I could n't be responsible for the cruel things that had happened in the world , or to me . But I could do my errand here : I had two hands and two legs and a wife and a child , same or better as anybody . She came back through the mist . I helped her stow the oars . " No , silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cormorants are nesting , hundreds of them . They 're so beautiful the way they fold their wings . " " I 'm so glad you got this boat , " she said , holding our baby in the stern . I was going to tell her about the crabs ; but I said , " And we 're all together in it . " When we came back , we must have been generating an acceptable happiness . The storekeeper was there waiting for Captain Sam and supplies ; my wife waved to his wife and he must have thought she was waving to him . He lifted his hand grudgingly to her , then his wife took up our baby . He looked at me , then offered me a hand up . " They love it here , " said the wife to her husband . " I want to live here forever , " said my wife , happily with the warmth of the water on her face . We did n't , but things went better that summer and we had a few friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those crabs at the bottom of the sea , I also recall the shock as the storekeeper pulled me out of the boat , and stood beside me on the dock close enough for the beginning of something .
