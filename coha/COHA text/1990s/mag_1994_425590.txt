Section : School Wars American Education Under Siege <p> THE 1993 defeat for school choice in California seems to have spooked choice supporters and set them to thinking about alternative strategies . Only in Arkansas and Oregon were choice initiatives circulated in 1994 , and both of those drives failed . Many activists have decided the voters are n't ready for choice , so it might be more effective to seek change through the legislative process or the courts . <p> For supporters of real choice , there are problems with both legislation and litigation . The biggest danger of school vouchers is that they will be used to regulate , control , and eventually destroy private schools . The experience with government aid to colleges , which are now subject to a plethora of rules and regulations , makes it hard to ignore that concern . The authors of California 's Proposition 174 , the most carefully crafted choice initiative yet , tried to avoid the problem by providing that no new regulation of private schools could be imposed without a three-fourths vote of the state legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a two-thirds vote of the relevant governmental body and a nearly unobtainable majority vote of the voters in that jurisdiction . It is impossible to imagine a state legislature building such protections  --  against itself  --  into choice legislation . <p> As for litigation , the Institute for Justice lawsuits against the Chicago and Los Angeles school systems , which argue that the promise of equal educational opportunity ' requires school vouchers , are a noble attempt to put public education on trial . But a victory  --  a court-ordered voucher plan  --  would surely constitute appalling overreaching by the courts  --  right-wing Warrenism , ' in the words of former Bush administration speech writer Daniel McGroarty . <p> Choice advocates should not give up the initiative effort . Many past initiatives  --  notably Proposition 13 , the Jarvis - Gann tax-cut proposal  --  failed many times before finally amassing a majority . And the campaigns to pass an initiative are an important way of educating the public about the voucher idea . <p> One lesson drawn by many choice advocates from the California experience was summed up by The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simply contained provisions requiring schools that received voucher money to meet some basic standards set by the authorities . ' Such provisions would make a choice plan a Trojan horse , concealing a regulatory monster inside an education plan . And the initiative probably still would have failed if it had included such provisions , given the lack of genuine public understanding and the massive spending by opponents of choice . Not only did the California Teachers Association and its allies spend some $16 million to defeat Proposition 174 , but the anti-174 spots were virtually the only political ads on television in a special off-year election . The ads would not have had such an impact had they been swallowed up by commercials for gubernatorial , senatorial , congressional , and legislative candidates ( as they would be in 1994 or 1996 ) . <p> The best approach for choice advocates now is to try to place initiatives on as many state ballots as possible in 1996 ( 23 states allow voter initiatives ) . Such initiatives are part of the process of developing public support , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread their resources thin . Remember , those who man the Berlin Wall keeping students inside the state monopoly system must defeat choice everywhere . Those seeking to liberate children and families need only one victory to show the rest of the country the superiority of markets over monopoly . <p> Choice advocates need to gain a broader base of support as they work to qualify initiatives for the ballot . Previous initiatives have generally been developed by small groups of conservative or libertarian ideologues . Those groups must bring in the support of business , minority voters , elected officials ( in California the opposition of the Republican governor was an obvious failure of the choice campaign ) , and suburban voters . <p> It will not be easy to find a specific choice proposal that appeals to all those groups . Thus choice advocates should adopt a conscious strategy of designing different proposals for the ballots of different states . Along with expanded polling and focus-group efforts , that will help us determine just what kind of plan can garner majority support . The objections that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . <p> Suburban voters are not persuaded that their school systems need shaking up . They do  --  those schools are good only compared with other monopoly American systems  --  but that realization can wait for another day . Meanwhile , suburbanites fear that the schools they have struggled to pay for with big mortgages and high property taxes will be destroyed by an influx of poorly educated , undisciplined students from inner cities . Few people articulate this concern ; a notable exception is syndicated columnist Samuel Francis of the Washington Times , who put the argument in its sharpest form : Maybe the suburbanites know that once ' choice ' passes into law , the private suburban schools they 've worked hard to choose wo n't be worth choosing as minorities move in . ' Some will suspect racism here . But it is understandable that suburbanites would object to bureaucrats in a distant state capital forcing them to accept an infusion of disruptive students , whatever their race , in their schools . <p> The solution is simple : allow school districts to exempt themselves from receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration . International public opinion roundly condemns countries that prevent their citizens from leaving but grants much more leeway with regard to immigration policy . Similarly , a choice plan should insist that districts allow unsatisfied families to emigrate , ' using the voucher to attend different schools , but it could let districts set their own immigration policies . Private schools would still provide plenty of options for dissatisfied students . <p> A stronger safeguard would be to limit vouchers to private schools . Each student could attend her local public school or take the voucher and attend any private school of her choice  --  but there would be no public-school choice beyond what districts might adopt internally . <p> Some choice supporters , such as John Coons of the University of California at Berkeley Law School , refused to support Proposition 174 because it provided for a voucher ( which it called a scholarship ) of only about $2,600 , more than the average cost of private school but in Coons 's opinion insufficient to allow the most educationally deprived students to find a suitable private education . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the state currently spends on a child in public school . ( The national average is about $6,000 . ) This would mean no cost savings from vouchers , but it might attract support from liberal and minority voters . <p> On the other hand , the false claim that vouchers would cost the taxpayers money has been used effectively against choice initiatives , which failed in both Colorado ( in 1992 ) and California while fiscal conservatism prevailed in other initiatives . Teachers ' unions and their allies make pro-taxpayer arguments with a straight face and to great effect . They claim that vouchers will cost the taxpayers money because the 10 percent of students now enrolled in private schools will get them immediately . That 's true , but if the voucher amount is about half what the state spends on public school students and if at least 10 percent of the students leave the public schools , then the taxpayers are ahead of the game . Since it 's difficult to get that message across , advocates might propose an initiative that would apply only to first-graders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That way no current private-school students would be eligible , and it would be easier to explain how low the cost of choice would be . <p> ANOTHER WAY to hold down the cost would be to provide means-tested vouchers . A state might offer a full voucher for students from families below the poverty level , phasing it out as family income rose toward the median income , or even up to 200 percent of the median . This proposal is appealing in several ways : it would cost less ; it would appeal to liberals who want to help poor and minority students without subsidizing middle-class families ; and it would suggest that paying for a good education is the responsibility of families unless they ca n't afford it . <p> A RELATED PROPOSAL would be a voucher plan that applied only in large cities , similar to the Milwaukee plan , passed by the Wisconsin legislature but available only to a small number of low-income Milwaukee families . An expanded version of that plan might offer vouchers only to the students in Detroit , say , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction ) and might make the vouchers usable only in that city 's private schools . Or the plan could apply to any district in which the median test score was below the 25th percentile for the state . Liberals would like the focus on the neediest children , and suburbanites could do something to help inner-city children without fearing the impact on their own schools . Such a proposal might well have the best chance of passing , and it would address our most serious educational problem , the disastrous schools in the inner city that trap our poorest children . <p> Here 's a twist on the one-city plan that would surely be hard even for the teachers ' unions to oppose : offer a voucher to any child who is assigned to a school that had more than one weapon incident during the previous school year . At least , supporters could say , we should allow children to escape from schools that are physically dangerous . ( Maybe the voucher would be suspended after three weapon-free years at the school . ) <p> Finally , an oldie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools : instead of a voucher , offer a tax credit . Any family that spends money on tuition could subtract that money from its income or property taxes . The credit could be made available to childless individuals and businesses , who in turn could use it to help low-income children . That would make it quite clear that the private schools are not receiving government money , only parents ' money , and they should not be subject to government regulation . <p> I have my own preferences among these plans ; some would work better than others to extend educational opportunity to more children and enlist the benefits of free-market competition in our educational system . But all of them would guarantee more opportunity and more quality than the current monopoly . Choice supporters should adopt the strategy of two , three , many initiatives ' until our children are liberated from the failing state monopoly . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By DAVID BOAZ <p> <p> Mr. Boaz is executive vice president of the Cato Institute and editor of Liberating Schools : Education in the Inner City . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some form of school choice legislation was introduced or pending in 34 states during 1993 , and at least 35 states now have grass-roots coalitions working for choice . <p> The Arizona legislature almost passed a statewide choice plan in 1994 , and there 's a good chance that choice will make a comeback in 1995 , especially if Governor Fife Symington is re-elected and House Education Committee chair Lisa Graham is elected superintendent of public instruction . Unfortunately , the pilot plan proposed in 1994 would provide vouchers to only 8,000 Arizona children by the year 2000 . A choice bill supported by several Democratic legislative leaders in Connecticut was defeated in the House on a tie vote in April and will probably not come up again this year . <p> In New Jersey , Governor Christine Todd Whitman is committed to legislation that would allow Mayor Bret Schundler to implement a voucher program in Jersey City , where the schools currently cost $9,200 per pupil each year . A poll taken in May showed that 62.5 per cent of New Jersey voters approve of letting Jersey City test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . The New Jersey Education Association , however , has recently announced that it is imposing a $50 union dues surcharge on its members to raise $10 million to defeat Schundler 's plan and other reform initiatives . In Wisconsin , state Representative Polly Williams and Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist , both Democrats , are backing legislation to open the voucher program that began in 1990 to all schools , not just nonsectarian schools . The 1994 legislative session has ended , so the voucher expansion will have to wait until 1995 . <p> More modest reforms in the direction of choice are being implemented or at least debated throughout the states . The private firm Education Alternatives , Inc. , is running nine Baltimore schools under contract . Chris Whittle 's Edison Project has won a contract to run three charter schools in Massachusetts beginning in 1995 . The idea of charter schools  --  autonomous public institutions freed of most regulations  --  is popular in many states , partly as a way to relieve pressure for choice . But by the time the lobbyists and insiders get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much room for innovation left . <p> Minnesota , the state that launched the public-school choice movement , is operating a grand total of six charter schools this year . In Michigan , where a game of chicken between the Democratic legislature and Republican Governor John Engler led to a total restructuring of educational finance , the outcome was an increase in the sales tax and a disappointing charter-school provision that limits sponsoring agencies to public-school boards and state universities and requires charter schools to employ state-certified teachers . Massachusetts allows only 25 charter schools , which may not enroll more than 0.75 per cent of the state 's students , but Republican Governor William F. Weld is trying to lift both caps . <p> In the vast educational wasteland of Washington , D.C. , School Superintendent Franklin L. Smith recently tried to contract out the operation of 15 low-performing schools to a private company but was stymied by a reactionary school board . Smith vowed to press the fight again next year ; in the meantime , the Washington Post reported , Smith , anxious to graduate more students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide eleventh-hour tutoring to as many as 600 District high school juniors and seniors who on average read at the fourth-grade level . ' <p> Some choice supporters , taking a leaf from the Left , have asked the courts to give them what the voters wo n't . The Institute for Justice filed suit on behalf of low-income parents in both Chicago and Los Angeles , arguing that the state 's promise of equal educational opportunity ' can be fulfilled only by giving its clients a voucher to pay for their own high-quality education . Institute lawyer Clint Bolick has also been in court defending legislative voucher programs in Milwaukee and Puerto Rico . <p> In Georgia a case filed in June seeks to implement a 1961 law that offered a voucher to families eager to flee newly integrated public schools . Ignored for 30 years , the law was rediscovered recently and may ironically be used to let inner-city minority children escape the schools their parents fought to enter . The 1961 law was supported by state Representative Zell Miller , who now burnishes his liberal credentials as governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Williams and Norquist pursue a legislative strategy , Landmark Legal Foundation attorney Mark Bredemeier is suing on behalf of parents who want to use the current voucher to attend religious schools . Bredemeier argues that granting a voucher only for secular schools restricts the parents ' free exercise of religion . <p> By DAVIDE BOAZ <p>
