<p> Bringing many of the biggest properties in media together under one roof , Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System completed their $ 7.57 billion merger . <p> Time Warner Inc. , regaining the title of the world 's largest media and entertainment company , now adds such familiar names as Fred Flintstone , Ted Turner , CNN and the Atlanta Braves to an already formidable stable that includes Bugs Bunny , HBO and Time magazine . <p> The deal was announced in September 1995 and won approval after a tough antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission , a lawsuit from entertainment partner U S West Inc. and widespread doubt over Ted Turner 's ability to accept a No. 2 role . <p> In separate meetings in New York , shareholders of the two companies voted overwhelmingly Oct. 10 to approve the merger . Turner Broadcasting shareholders voted 99.75 percent in favor ; Time Warner stockholders 98.23 percent in favor . <p> " This is the company that I 've always dreamed of and we are now here , complete , one team and one family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was founder and chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting and now becomes vice chairman and the largest single shareholder of the merged company , said : " Considering the difficulties we had with this merger ... it was quite a job to get it completed . " <p> Later , as his longtime secretary read a final motion to adjourn Turner Broadcasting 's final shareholder meeting , a tearful Turner dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief . <p> It should take about a year to actually combine the numerous , and in some cases overlapping , divisions of the two companies . Time Warner has not said how jobs will be lost , but estimates have run as high as 1,200 . <p> " One of the first things is going to be fairly significant layoffs from Turner , " said Larry Gerbrandt , an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates Inc. , a media research firm . He predicted a " painful transition . " <p> Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting differ in their corporate culture and personality , a contrast reflected in the reserved but ambitious Levin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of other matters to grapple with , including a restructuring of its cable partnership with U S West , the telephone company that tried to stop the merger . <p> Time Warner also plans to cut costs and debt to keep its stock price rising . <p> Time Warner is also embroiled in a dispute over its refusal to carry Rupert Murdoch 's new Fox News channel over its cable systems . Murdoch is a longtime Turner antagonist ; on Oct. 9 he filed a $ 2 billion breach-of-contract suit against Time Warner . <p> As a condition for approving the merger , federal regulators required Time Warner to carry another news channel , in addition to its own CNN , on some of its cable systems . But the company opted for MSNBC instead of Fox . <p> Time Warner insisted that its decision is legal . <p> On Oct. 11 , a federal judge in New York halted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 's efforts to present the Fox channel on a city-run cable station it runs on Time Warner 's New York City cable system . Although the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that she thought the Giuliani administration was acting improperly in trying to use the city 's noncommercial stations to broadcast the Fox channel and another channel Time Warner had rejected , Bloomberg Television News . <p> Microsoft Network Drops Price , Unveils New Online Content <p> REDMOND , Wash . ( AP ) - Microsoft Corp . is overhauling its online service , making it less expensive , less techy and more like television . <p> In coming months , the Microsoft Network will offer dozens of new Internet services , including music programs , game and comedy productions , an online travel agency , city guides and investment tracking . <p> The new products introduced Oct. 10 are part of the software giant 's bid to gain dominance on the Internet , a market where it had little presence just a year ago . They also underscore Microsoft 's emergence as a media company producing news , features and entertainment for the World Wide Web . <p> MSN began last year as an online service , to compete with Prodigy , CompuServe and America Online . But with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repositioning MSN as a feature-rich subscription service on the Web . <p> Microsoft , which had $ 8.7 billion in revenues last year , and other online services have run into strong competition from Internet providers , many of whom offer unlimited access to the Internet for around $ 20 a month . <p> Microsoft said it would offer unlimited access to the Internet and to MSN for a flat $ 19.95 a month . An alternate plan charges $ 6.95 a month for five hours ' access , with extra hours billed at $ 2.50 each . <p> MSN has grown to 1.6 million subscribers , making it the third-largest online service behind America Online with 6.5 million members and CompuServe with 4.5 million . <p> Pete Higgins , Microsoft vice president for applications and content , said MSN expects to double its membership by June 1997 . <p> Although Microsoft does n't expect MSN to turn a profit until the turn of the century , it is laying the groundwork to be a major force on the Internet , Higgins said . <p> The Wall Street Journal must change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business because it belongs to a political monthly in the state , a judge ruled . <p> The Wall Street Journal published its new pages in regional editions under the " California Journal " masthead the past two Wednesdays . <p> The paper argued that , since the pages were included in the Marketplace section of the newspaper , they were not covered under a previous restraining order . <p> The newspaper , however , may no longer use the name , which has been used by the California Journal monthly since 1970 , Judge Earl Warren Jr . ruled Oct. 10 . <p> " We feel like David , who with his second pebble , knocked Goliath off , " said Tom Hoeber , publisher of the 17,000-circulation monthly . " This is everything we could have hoped for . " <p> Lawyers for the newspaper - total circulation 1.8 million , 280,000 in California - filed an appeal Oct. 11 asking for a decision by Oct. 15 - before the next edition of the weekly regional pages are published Oct. 16 . <p> " The Wall Street Journal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order , according to Journal lawyer Rex Heinke .

PAUL , Minn . ( AP ) - The Minnesota Supreme Court dismissed a suit against the Star Tribune by a losing state senate candidate whose photograph was mistakenly printed next to a story about fraud .

The court agreed . <p> The court also said the dispute does not belong in the courts , but that Derus could take the matter to the legislature , which serves as the final judge of its membership and convenes in January . <p> Reporter Who Interviewed Murder Suspect Jailed for Contempt of Court <p> WEST PALM BEACH , Fla . ( AP ) - A newspaper reporter who refused to testify about details of his interview with a murder suspect was sentenced to 70 days in jail for contempt of court . <p> David Kidwell of The Miami Herald told Judge Roger Colton he would rather be locked up than answer questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of killing his stepdaughter . <p> " I do n't want to go to jail , " Kidwell said Oct. 7 . " I would rather go back to work this afternoon . But either way , when I do go back to work , I have to know I 'm free to pursue all sides of a story without interference from the government . " <p> Prosecutors say they want to confirm that Zile , who faces the death penalty , told Kidwell he was " furious " with his stepdaughter , Christina Holt , the night the girl died . <p> The quote appeared in the newspaper . Although Zile made similar statements to police , Kidwell 's report contained more details of Zile 's version of the events . <p> Zile 's first trial ended in a mistrial . Jury selection in his retrial is to begin Oct. 15 . <p> Kidwell , who could have been sentenced to six months in jail , said : " I hoped that my willingness to go to jail would be enough to keep me off the stand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor Scott Cupp said . " His statement about his professional convictions and ethics has nothing to do with this case . David Kidwell feels he is above the law . " <p> The Herald fought on Kidwell 's behalf , but ultimately advised him to answer questions about the interview and the story . <p> " It 's an awful thing , " executive editor Doug Clifton said . " We fought it vigorously in the courts and faced the unhappy conclusion that the law is not on our side . " <p> Clifton said the newspaper would pay Kidwell 's salary during his jail term ; fellow staffers volunteered to pay a $ 500 fine . <p> The Society of Professional Journalists called the sentence unreasonably harsh . <p> " If the public believes that reporters can be compelled to testify in such cases , it will significantly erode the credibility of the press , " SPJ president Steve Geimann said . <p> Twenty-nine states and Washington , D.C. have " shield laws " that attempt to spell out when reporters are protected from subpoenas . Florida does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Amendment . In several recent cases , reporters have lost their attempts to refuse to testify . <p> In a similar case , Michelle Worobec , 32 , a reporter for the Naples Daily News , was ordered Oct. 10 to appear in court this week to testify in the trial of a defendant in a triple-murder case that she covered . <p> The newspaper 's attorney lost a bid to quash the subpoena but Worobec said she 'll go to jail rather than testify . <p> An attorney for Charles Graves , one of two men charged with killing three employees at a Cracker Barrel restaurant last November , subpoenaed Worobec after the reporter 's interview with the other defendant appeared in the paper . <p> In the jailhouse interview , defendant Brandy Jennings said the murders were n't planned . <p> Stephen Grogoza , Graves ' attorney , believes Worobec 's interview may help clear Graves of pre-meditated murder . Graves and Jennings also face robbery charges . <p> " She put information in her story that nobody had , " Grogoza said . " The only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he told her .

While many other newspapers have started their own sites on the Internet 's World Wide Web , readers can view them for free . <p> The number of paid Interactive Edition subscribers pales in comparison to the 1.8 million circulation of the Journal 's print edition . <p> The Interactive Edition was launched on April 29 , but it was n't until Sept. 21 that free access was ended . <p> Subscriptions to the Web site cost $ 49 a year for those who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who do .

Baker said the first weeks of the new year will be a test of the Web site 's ability to sign those people as paying subscribers . <p> The Web site has 30 advertisers who are typically paying between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000 a month depending upon how often their ad appears and how many people view it , Baker said . <p> He said about 32,000 to 35,000 readers visit the Web site each day . <p> Media Members Challenge Makeup of Governor 's Public Records Panel <p> PHOENIX ( AP ) - Media representatives who were not invited to join a task force on Arizona 's public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 14-member board , appointed by Gov .

The Arizona Republic , the state 's largest newspaper , and Tucson media outlets do not have representatives on the panel . <p> Republic executives and others attending the panel 's first meeting Oct. 9 , including some board members , questioned the committee 's composition and objectives . <p> " I 'm not sure everyone on this panel thinks we should be tinkering with this , " said panel member John Hook , an anchor with KSAZ-TV in Phoenix . " We may be getting into something that could be detrimental . " <p> Symington announced creation of the panel in a news release Oct. 3 . The panel will meet four times before year 's end to discuss topics such as electronic records , what records are open to the public and the process of making and responding to requests for public records . <p> Lisa Hauser , who is both chairwoman of the task force and the governor 's general counsel , said the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public records .

" What 's the rush ? " <p> Media representatives at the meeting complained of " stonewalling " by Symington administration officials on routine public records requests . <p> Department of Corrections director Terry Stewart , a task force member , said the definition of a public record under the law is too broad and needs clarification . Stewart said he 's constantly asking the attorney general for a ruling on what records he may release . <p> Oklahoma Publisher Buys Papers in Guthrie and Logan County <p> GUTHRIE , Okla .

He won a 1985 Pulitzer prize for coverage of famine in Ethiopia . <p> A similar message should go to officials in Angola , the last of five countries on Christopher 's first official African trip south of the Sahara Desert , CPJ African coordinator Kakuna Kerina said at a news conference . <p> From 1993 through 1995 Ethiopia jailed about 50 journalists , more than any other African country , and 31 were behind bars at the end of last year , CPJ said . <p> Ethiopia harasses and segregates private media journalists , providing government information only to official organs , CPJ said in a study based on a 12-day mission there last May by Friedman and Kerina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before studying the report . <p> A mock newscaster delivers the " breaking news " on Democratic Senate candidate Robert Torricelli . What follows is a rapid recitation of controversies involving the Democrat - told by the campaign of his opponent , Republican Dick Zimmer . <p> As with other spots in one of the nation 's nastiest campaigns , the ad provokes questions about its substance . But it also raises a question of style . Is it misleading to use a mock newscast that , to some , may look like a real one ? <p> Top officials at the CBS television affiliates in New York and Philadelphia thought so . Both stations are running the ad , but have added their own disclaimer to make sure viewers know they 're watching a political commercial . <p> " It does n't look like a very good-looking newscast , but it does look like a newscast , " said Bud Carey , vice president and general manager of WCBS-TV in New York . <p> Jim Gallagher , sales manager of KYW-TV in Philadelphia , said the station will run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is truly a ' breaking news story . " ' <p> The commercial , which began airing Oct. 8 , is the latest of a series of negative spots that have peppered the tight race between two members of New Jersey 's congressional delegation . <p> The spots are about all New Jersey knows of Zimmer and Torricelli as both fight for attention in a presidential year . Their first debate was hardly noticed : it competed with Yankees baseball and college football on a Saturday afternoon , and the sound went dead for 20 minutes on most broadcast outlets . <p> After both campaigns aired a series of ads attacking the other 's record , this one attacks Torricelli 's character . It uses a number of controversies , including a recent report that Torricelli had cared for the daughter of a federal fugitive . <p> Glenn Ritt , editor of The Record of Hackensack , which broke the story , issued a statement saying the advertisement misrepresented the report . <p> In the ad , the actress playing the newscaster goes through a stream of " reports " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown behind her . Atop the screen , the spot says " Torricelli Controversy . " Several times , " breaking news " scrolls across the screen . <p> The ad 's disclaimer , which shows this is a paid campaign commercial , comes at the beginning of the ad , but most eyes are drawn to " breaking news " moving across the screen . <p> Carey said he initially decided against running the ad on his station because he had not even realized there was the required disclaimer , which includes a small photograph of Zimmer . <p> David Karvelas , spokesman for the Zimmer campaign , said the commercial was designed to use " real media accounts " of Torricelli controversies . <p> " To us , those news articles are much more crippling than any campaign ad , " said Karvelas . <p> Josh Isay , a spokesman for the Torricelli campaign , called the ad " distorted and despicable " in both content and style . <p> John Warner Fires Campaign Consultant Who Doctored TV Ad <p> RICHMOND , Va . ( AP ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV ad with an altered photograph of Mark Warner , his Democratic opponent . <p> " I accept full responsibility , " John Warner said Oct. 10 at a news conference . <p> The senator said he fired Greg Stevens &; Co. , which also does work for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole , after confirming that the photograph had been altered . <p> " The ad is so terrible that all I can do is offer Virginians an apology , " said the senator , who also apologized to his opponent . He predicted that Virginians would be fair when judging the effect of the ad on his own campaign . <p> " They 'll recognize that this was a terrible mistake , that I took responsibility , that I apologized , that I personally had nothing , repeat , nothing , whatsoever to do with it , " said John Warner , no relation to his opponent . <p> Greg Stevens also apologized and said the campaign was never told the photo was altered . <p> Mark Warner , who trails the three-term incumbent by 16 points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire those responsible for the ad , which ran for three days starting Oct. 8 . <p> " What did John know and when did he know it ? " he said , adding that if the senator did not answer those questions before the candidates ' Oct. 18 debate , he would bring them up himself . <p> The 30-second ad featured a photograph that had been doctored to depict Mark Warner shaking hands with former Gov . L. Douglas Wilder as they stood in front of a smiling President Clinton . Wilder and Clinton are unpopular with many Virginia voters . <p> The ad superimposed Mark Warner 's face over the body of Sen. Charles S. Robb , who was actually shaking hands with Wilder . Mark Warner was only a bystander in the original photo from October 1994 . <p> The ad labels Mark Warner a liberal " political insider " who raised millions of dollars for Democrats . <p> Wilder said he thinks he was featured in the ad because he is black , not because he is considered a liberal . <p> " If he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , " Wilder said .

In their place were listings for the Fox News Channel , CNN 's new round-the-clock rival . <p> The Post and Fox are both owned by Rupert Murdoch .

( AP ) - A state appeals court upheld the dismissal of a defamation suit by a New Jersey Turnpike Authority spokeswoman against a radio station . <p> Authority spokeswoman Lynn Fleeger had claimed talk-show hosts on WKXW-FM , known as New Jersey 101.5 , defamed her and damaged her reputation by making comments about the sound of her voice . The talk show personalities ridiculed Fleeger because she had refused to be interviewed on the air regarding toll increases , according to the court opinion . <p> Judge Judith Yaskin dismissed Fleeger 's case in December , ruling that while the remarks about Fleeger could be defined as vulgar and distasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would misconstrue as having been intended to represent facts . <p> Fleeger appealed , but a two-judge appellate panel on Oct. 8 upheld the dismissal . The court said proving damage to reputation would be contingent on the fact that people must take as fact the information that was broadcast . The court said parody and humor were clearly outside this realm . <p> Media outlets frequently try to fend off libel and defamation lawsuits by claiming the person was a public figure , but it was not determined whether Fleeger fit this definition . Public figures must prove a reckless disregard for truth , not just simple error , when attempting defamation lawsuits . <p> Developers Sue over Story Depicting Life in Border Subdivisions <p> EL PASO , Texas ( AP ) - A group of developers have sued CBS in federal court , alleging their reputations were ruined by a " 60 Minutes " segment depicting poor living conditions in border developments called colonias . <p> Kasco Ventures Inc. and five individuals are asking for more than $ 50,000 in damages .

The other plaintiffs are four of her family members . <p> The segment alleged fraudulent real-estate development deals and unhealthy living conditions in Texas colonias , some of which are substandard subdivisions lacking even basic water and sewage service . <p> Also featured were allegations of unethical business practices between developers and politicians involving prosecution of colonia developers . The report questioned how U.S. Rep. Ron Coleman , D-El Paso , could have close personal and political ties to the Kastrin family while also fighting for federal money to improve conditions in the colonias . <p> After the report , Coleman dropped Deborah Kastrin 's father as his re-election campaign chairman and her brother as trustee of Coleman 's blind trust .
