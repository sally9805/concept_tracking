The creatively pierced , multiply tattooed teenagers who hang out at every mall in America probably do n't realize it  --  and neither , undoubtedly , do their unsettled parents  --  but they belong to a tradition as old as recorded history  --  probably much older . Ever since our Neolithic ancestors invented art tens of thousands of years ago , humans have been painting , sculpting and otherwise decorating everything in sight . The human body is just the nearest and most intimate canvas . Says anthropologist Enid Schildkrout of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City : " There is no known culture in which people do not paint , pierce , tattoo , reshape or simply adorn their bodies . " <P> Now this universal phenomenon is being celebrated in two separate showcases . Last week a cross-cultural exhibition titled " Body Art : Marks of Identity , " curated by Schildkrout and devoted to the past 4,000 years of body modification  --  " bod-mod " to the cognoscenti  --  opened at the American Museum . At the same time , photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have published African Ceremonies ( Abrams ; $150 ) , two magnificent volumes documenting the continent 's rapidly vanishing kaleidoscope of tribal rites , many of which involve elaborate body decoration . <P> In the museum show , Schildkrout and her colleagues focus on five types of bod-mod : tattooing , scarring , piercing , painting and shaping . And while some examples may seem bizarre to Western eyes , says Schildkrout , " we want people to realize that everyone , including themselves , performs some form of transformation . We color our hair , wear makeup , put on clothes , have plastic surgery . " <P> Our reasons for doing it , moreover , are largely the same . Traditionally , body art has served to attract the opposite sex , boost self-esteem , ward off or invoke spirits , indicate social position or marital status , identify with a particular age or gender group or mark a rite of passage , such as puberty or marriage . It 's this sort of strictly prescribed , highly ritualistic decoration that Beckwith and Fisher depict in African Ceremonies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant to every stage of development , from birth to death , " says Fisher . <P> But while the traditional , often spiritually based versions of bod-mod are quickly disappearing among indigenous peoples , the impulses behind personal adornment remain unchanged : attracting a mate , signaling status , declaring allegiance to a group . <P> Or asserting independence from it . While teenagers use pierced tongues and the like to set themselves apart , some in their 20s and 30s have latched on to the " neotribal " look , an amalgam of facial tattoos , piercings and " native " hairdos , and jewelry that borrows from cultures from the South Pacific to the Amazon . Much of this serves the same countercultural function that long hair did in the ' 60s , observes Rufus Camphausen , an author based in the Netherlands who has written extensively on tribal customs . Says he : " These symbols are a way of saying , ' I do n't belong to the supermarket society . ' "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
