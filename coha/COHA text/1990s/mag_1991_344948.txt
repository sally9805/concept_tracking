At the age of 18 , Darren Star surprised his large , tight-knit family in suburban Potomac , Md. , by moving to far-out Los Angeles . Within a few years , he wrote and sold the script for Doin ' Time on Planet Earth , a film about a teenager who thinks he 's from outer space . After that , Star never looked back . Today , at 30 , he draws a six-figure income as the creator of Beverly Hills , 90210 , the Thursday-night melodrama that has captured the teen audience by portraying youthful angst and L.A. glitz . Star owns a house in the Hollywood Hills , drives a Porsche convertible , lifts weights and romps with his retriever at his Malibu beach hideaway . " I based 90210 on my experience coming out here , " says Star . " What a different life-style ! I mean I never saw so many Ferraris and Rolls-Royces . I guess I 've adjusted to California life . " <P> The industry that Star works in has made the same transition . Once controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the early 1970s  --  when strict limits on the networks ' own production took effect  --  has become more and more a captive of Los Angeles . It is especially dominated by a small but powerful group of L.A.-based writer-producers who year after year create the lion 's share of successful prime-time programs . Numbering no more than 150 , they serve as the industry 's permanent bureaucracy , remaining in place while studio chiefs and network honchos come and go . As a result , they have gained enormous influence over what is broadcast into America 's living rooms . This group , says Elizabeth Thoman , executive director of the Center for Media and Values in Los Angeles , has replaced " the storytelling aunts and uncles we do n't have anymore . " <P> Who belongs to this elite ? Though they reside in the most ethnically mixed city in America , the most powerful writer-producers are no more diverse than the U.S. Senate . They are , on the average , 41 years old . Nine out of 10 are male , and 98% are white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most important , though the majority hail from the East and Midwest , they have steeped themselves in the gushy , vaguely countercultural sensibility that flourishes in some affluent precincts of Los Angeles . " A Republican is not unheard of  --  but rare , " says Charles Slocum , an industry analyst with the Writers Guild in Hollywood . " Most are liberal Democrats and idealists . They have the baby boomers ' we-can-change-the-world mentality of the ' 60s . " <P> In recent years this powerful clique of prime-time producers has responded to the challenge of cable programming by grasping for ever bolder contemporary themes they hope will win the do-or-die ratings war  --  and there is no better source for such material than Southern California . Thus Los Angeles and its environs have been the setting for a steady stream of TV series  --  from The Beverly Hillbillies ( 1962-71 ) to Beverly Hills , 90210 , as well as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , Blossom , L.A. Law and Baywatch  --  in which the sunshine , free-floating wackiness and materialistic life-styles of Los Angeles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Junger Witt , who has five shows on prime time right now ( including Golden Girls , Empty Nest and ; Nurses ) : " California and especially Los Angeles represent some sort of magical place to the rest of the world . It makes good business sense to plug into that fantasy . It 's juicy stuff . "
