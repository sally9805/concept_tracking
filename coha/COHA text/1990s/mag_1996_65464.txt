When was the last time you saw a woman of nearly 40 turn a cartwheel ? Not counting , of course , your mother when you finally moved out of the house and Marcia Clark when she found out F. Lee Bailey was in the slammer. // Patty Sheehan turned a cartwheel Sunday on the 18th green of the Dinah Shore Tournament Course in Rancho Mirage , Calif . For one giddy moment her spikes were topsy and her silver hair was turvy , and the ducks at the Mission Hills Country Club stopped panhandling to watch in admiration . The sight of unconfined joy is rare enough that no one  --  not even the trio of disappointed women golfers waiting by the green  --  questioned the Tightness of Sheehan 's celebration . // The cartwheel , Sheehan would say later , was suggested by her mother . Moms , bless ' em , are optimistic . To Leslie Sheehan , the fact that Patty had never won the Nabisco Dinah Shore , the LPGA 's first major championship of the year , meant that she was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five major-championship cups on display in Patty 's home in Reno . Shore herself , two years before her death from cancer in 1994 , had had Sheehan to her house for dinner . Presenting the Hall of Fame golfer with artwork in which she had depicted the 18th green of what was then called the Old Course at Mission Hills , Shore said , " This will give you luck someday , Mighty Mite . " // Sheehan needed some luck to win the 25th Dinah Shore . On the 15th hole of the final round , after squandering a two-shot lead with consecutive bogeys , she drove into a bunker , only to have the ball pop back out on the grass . On the 18th , needing a par 5 for a final-round 281 and a one-stroke victory , she drove so perilously close to the water on the left that her heart nearly stopped ; her ball , scooting between the lake and a cluster of palms , rolled as true as a putt and came to rest less than a club length from the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveled at her ability to shoot a one-under-par 71 despite five bogeys and four three-putt greens . " That , " she said , " should be enough to not win a tournament . " // But as Sheehan 's many pursuers knew , there are more ways to not win than to win . Tracy Hanson came unwound on Sunday after missing a short birdie putt on number 6 that would have given her the outright lead . Long-hitting Kelly Robbins hooked her drive into the eucalyptus trees on number 15 and made double bogey , blunting a six-birdie charge that momentarily had her leading at eight under . In fact seven players held or shared the lead on Sunday . Meg Mallon , winner of two previous majors , played the day 's steadiest golf , but she missed birdie putts on the last three holes . Annika Sorenstam , the reigning U.S. Women 's Open champ and the 1995 Player of the Year , carried a one-shot lead to the 18th green but three-putted from the fringe for bogey . // So it was a Pitfalls ' R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bridge to the island green at number 18 . " We were just chatting , " Mallon said later . About luck ? About Sheehan 's chances of bogeying 18 , forcing a four-woman playoff ? About the cup on 18 , which seemed to have been sprinkled with ball repellent ? About Brandie Burton 's try for birdie at 18 , which might have made it a five-way playoff ? " Meg was eating some kind of protein bar , " Robbins said . " It was kind of chewy. " // The whole week was chewy . What was hard to digest at this silver-anniversary Dinah Shore was the demeanor gap between the LPGA 's established stars and the wunderkinder who are on the brink of taking over the game . At Rancho Mirage you had the exuberance of youth  --  the smiles , the bold body language , the joie de vivre  --  and then you had the tight-lipped reserve they teach over at the Wrinkle Academy . The odd thing was , the youngsters were acting like old-timers , and vice versa . Sorenstam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely flexed an emotion ; she ground out pars and birdies with monotonously straight drives and with approach shots as conservative as a Pat Buchanan speech . Her apparent challenger for tour dominance , 21-year-old Karrie Webb of Queensland , Australia , wore mirrored sunglasses and played with such an economy of motion that one wondered if she had picked up some desert creature 's habit of protective stillness . // " When I was winning this tournament in ' 86 , we did n't have sunglasses to hide behind , " LPGA Hall of Famer Pat Bradley said on Saturday afternoon . " But I would pull my visor down as low as I could . A lot is said through the eyes . Cover them up , and no one knows if you 're happy , sad , nervous or scared . " // The LPGA 's veterans , by way of contrast , seemed almost frothy . Amy Alcott , who set the previous standard for effusiveness by jumping into the moat on 18 after her Shore wins in ' 88 and ' 91 , shot a first-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyrics and bawdy banter . ( Asked if she planned a new version of her instructional tape that plays endlessly on hotel televisions , Alcott said , " Is that the X-rated one called Swinging in the Nude ? " ) Sheehan  --  who at age 35 celebrated her first U.S. Women 's Open title , in 1992 , by dancing on the putting green at Oakmont Country Club with the trophy lid perched on her head  --  seemed almost as pleased with the 67 she shot on Saturday . She smiled broadly and joked about putts that had n't fallen for 45 holes , and putts that had fallen in her five-birdie back nine . // Need a visual ? After Saturday 's round , 19-year LPGA veteran Martha Nause , one shot off the lead , smiled and made self-deprecating jokes while effortlessly swatting drives downrange . A few feet away 24-year-old coleader Burton beat balls with a glum intensity that kept caddies and other players at a distance . // Sheehan was probably in the best position to judge whether youth , to paraphrase Oscar Wilde , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorenstam and Webb on Thursday and Friday , Sheehan came away satisfied that her rivals ' smoky lenses did not conceal flinty eyes . " Yes , they may be quiet , but they 're very , very nice people , " Sheehan said . She even counseled Sorenstam , who was criticized for skipping the LPGA 's season-opening Tournament of Champions , to follow her instincts instead of the herd . " The media and the public need to be more forgiving of her , " Sheehan said of the Swedish star , whose 67 last week tied her for the opening-round lead . " She 'll come out of her shell . You just have to wait and watch . " // Sure enough , on Sunday Sorenstam provided glimpses of the charmer she may yet become . She let her sunglasses ride atop her cap . She pumped her arm and smiled to punctuate a lead-seizing 20-foot birdie putt on number 16 . And when her 6-footer for par on 18 rimmed out , she managed a stoic smile and hugged the equally frustrated Mallon , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is the master of the stoic smile  --  not to mention the gracious smile , the forgiving smile , the smile of relief and the ecstatic smile , all of which she got to use on Sunday . Playing in the final group with Burton and Nausc , Sheehan birdied the first hole , thrilling her vocal fans  --  " Go , Patty ! "  --  and starting dominos falling . She would make only seven pars for the round , and later she would insist that she had enjoyed herself thoroughly . // But then this is the woman who cried uncontrollably after blowing a nine-shot lead in the 1990 U.S. Women 's Open and bounced back with two more tour wins before the season ended ; the woman who in ' 92 birdied the final two holes at Oakmont , after a rain delay , to force the playoff she won against Juli Inkster ; the woman who has a 14-year-old carton of misprinted balloons proudly advertising the PATTY SHEEHAN FUN CLUB ; the woman who lost everything in the ' 89 San Francisco earthquake and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a ceramic jar filled with good-luck coins that she has picked up off floors and pavements . Before Sunday 's round , Sheehan 's caddie , Carl Laib , showed her a battered penny he had found the night before  --  face up , as required by Sheehan  --  at a Palm Springs joint called The Truck Stop . Laib carried the penny in his pocket all day . // There was , as well , a little magic in the clubs Laib lugged around the desert . Early in the week Sheehan had the graphite shafts pulled out of her Big Bertha irons  --  her sixth shaft change of the year  --  and went back to steel , with which she had won 34 LPGA events . " I could n't feel what I was doing with graphite , " she said . " I needed a bit more vibration in the shaft . " But it was steel 's vibration that had given her career-threatening tendinitis in both elbows . Her dilemma : Graphite relieves the tendinitis , but steel relieves the pain of slipping down the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , after 12 years in the top 10. ) // So , yes , there was a little luck , superstition , technology and just plain silliness involved in Sheehan 's Dinah Shore win . She walked across the bridge to the 18th green not knowing if she was going to laugh or bawl before she walked back . Her third shot , a wicked pull from a fairway bunker 116 yards out , had left her with what she called " a monster putt " : a hundred feet , according to the TV folks , a few feet more if you distrust round numbers . Later Sheehan would say , " I never dreamed I would have to do that to win the Dinah Shore "  --  that is , two-putt the horizon . // She could have squeezed in a daydream in the time it took her lag putt to mosey up toward the hole . Sheehan judged her second putt to be about 10 feet  --  it looked more like eight  --  but the three ladies in waiting never allowed themselves to hope that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorenstam whispered to her fianc , " It 's going in. " // Was it ever . Sheehan wheeled around to celebrate when the ball was still a foot from the cup . By the time it found the heart , Sheehan 's fans were screaming and bouncing like excited children . " What an awesome two-putt , " said Robbins . " But if anybody 's going to do it , Patty 's going to do it . " // Three hours later , after icing her right elbow and downing a couple of **25;105;TOOLONG cocktails , Sheehan slipped into the winner 's white bathrobe and walked back down to the 18th green . With the moon out and the last light of day coating the San Jacinto Mountains with pink frosting , she stepped off her monster putt . The first estimate was 90 feet . Her second hike made it 102 feet . Then she autographed champagne glasses for a few friends and well-wishers  --  the bubbly signing the bubbly , so to speak . // " All right , I 'll give you an exclusive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat . " // If she meant " win again "  --  sure , fine . But if she meant " win again , this tournament , this way "  --  no way . Grandmothers will turn somersaults before that happens .
