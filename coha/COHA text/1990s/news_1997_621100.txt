<p> Billy Graham has preached to more people than anyone in the history of the world . No one else even comes close . Graham 's television broadcasts have been viewed by hundreds of millions of people around the world . Millions have personally witnessed his Christian crusades at hundreds of massive revival meetings from Aarhus , Denmark , to Azagorsk , Russia . This Friday , the giant of world evangelism convenes the first of nine Bay Area crusades and Christian concerts  --  including his first worship service in San Francisco in nearly four decades . <p> William Franklin Graham was born on a dairy farm in North Carolina to Scottish-Irish parents on Nov. 7 , 1918 , but was " born again " at a revival meeting 16 years later . His evangelical career took off in 1944 , when Graham , then a young suburban pastor and budding radio evangelist , was invited to speak at the 3,400-seat Orchestra Hall in Chicago before young servicemen from the adjacent U.S.O. <p> Graham got his first big boost from newspaper czar William Randolph Hearst . Impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his editors to " puff Graham . " And they did , running glowing full-page stories about the young preacher in all 22 papers of the Hearst chain , including the San Francisco Examiner . <p> During the 1950s , Graham was an early supporter of the civil rights movement and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . That cost him some Southern support but improved his reputation among blacks and the mainstream media . Famous as a pastor to presidents , Graham 's closest and most controversial political tie was to Richard Nixon . While officially neutral , Graham was a behind-the-scenes force in Nixon 's 1960 campaign against John Kennedy , whose Catholicism worried many American evangelicals , and also dropped clear hints in his support of Nixon 's successful 1968 presidential run . Graham stuck by Nixon during much of the Watergate scandal , only to be embarrassed later by the expletive-filled tapes secretly recorded in the Oval Office . <p> In the 1980s , Graham remained untouched by the sex-and- money scandals that disgraced Jimmy Swaggart , Jim and Tammy Bakker and other TV evangelists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability in evangelical ministry . His unparalleled popularity has landed him on the Gallup Poll 's " 10 Most Admired Men in the World " list 37 times in the past 45 years . <p> Q : It 's been 40 years since your last crusade at the Cow Palace . Back then , you wrote a column in The Chronicle and you talked about the relatively low rate of church attendance in San Francisco . It still is much lower than the rest of the country . Why do you think that is ? <p> A : Part of it is because of the history of San Francisco . It 's a pretty bawdy town . It did n't have its roots in the church , the way some of the Eastern or Middle Western or Southern cities did . San Francisco has always been looked on as one of the most beautiful cities in the world , and it 's a city where people come to enjoy themselves . When you have beautiful weather like you have , so many outdoor things to do and sports , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , unless their hearts are really dedicated to God and the church . <p> . <p> Q : You started out as an evangelist with Youth for Christ . Now , at 78 years old , youth remains a big part of your crusade . Looking at the upcoming schedule , you have a couple of Christian rock bands coming in . <p> A : That 's right . It 's not necessarily full-scale rock . ( Laughs ) It 's Christian rock in the sense that the lyrics are Christian , and we try to see that the people get copies of the lyrics , so they can follow the music , and the lyrics are really Gospel . I think we have to think in terms of generations changing  --  this is called the Generation X by some . Many people are wondering , " How can the church appeal to them ? How can the church deal with them ? " <p> They have the same problems we had 40 years ago . The problems have n't changed in the hearts of young people , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amusements that have changed . Not the individual person . He still suffers from loneliness , he may still suffer from frustration . <p> Most young people today are searching for something . They do n't know quite what it is . They want to find something they can hold onto and believe in , something that will take them through the rough times of their lives . <p> . <p> Q : At 78 , you 're still going strong . I understand you 've been suffering from Parkinson 's disease . How is your health , and how has Parkinson 's affected your ministry and your life ? <p> A : It has n't affected the ministry at all , although in some ways I 've had to cut back . If I did n't have Parkinson 's , I 'd still have to cut back , because I 'm now approaching 80 years of age . You do n't find many people that are evangelists , preaching the way I preach , at that age , because it 's an exhausting experience to stand before a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : There 's a lot of interest in the approach of the year 2000 . Do you see any significance in that ? <p> A : I think the events taking place in the world are very significant . It 's interesting that it 's taking place just as we approach 2000 . I do n't know the total significance of it , but I know the Middle East is almost at the point of blowing up again , and I know Korea has so much starvation , and yet the military is the second most powerful military force in Asia , next to China . They keep the military fully equipped , and they are able to sell weapons to other countries . My wife is on her way there now , as a guest of the government . She went to school in North Korea . She ca n't be with me here . She 's already on her way . <p> . <p> Q : She was born in China of a missionary family , right ? <p> A : Yes , but they sent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best foreign school in Asia . Pyongyang , the capital , used to be called Jerusalem of the East . It was a place where there were probably more Christians than any other place in the Far East . Today , there are hardly any Christians , and it 's the most Communist and the most closed country in the world . <p> . <p> Q : It 's such a contrast to South Korea , too . The church is very strong there , and growing . <p> A : I think the goal of both North and South is to unite . They are trying to find a way to do it . I 'm praying they will . I think this was the goal and ambition of Kim Il Sung , who was president of North Korea for so long and recently died . He put his arm around me and said : " I want you to know that I count you as a member of my family . " <p> I was the first American to address the students at the university since the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one Catholic and one Protestant . I 've been there twice now . I stayed a week or two on each occasion , but I did n't go much beyond Pyongyang . I took two trips to the countryside , but both were out to his country estate , where we were entertained by the president . <p> . <p> Q : A lot of religious sects are fascinated with the millennium  --  David Koresh and the folks down in Waco , and then Heaven 's Gate . While they were interested in UFOs , they were also reading the Book of Revelation . Are you afraid there will be more cults turning to this material ? <p> A : Well , the Book of Revelation is a part of the Bible , and some people misinterpret parts of it because it 's a very difficult book to understand . There are many symbols , and it uses a lot of Old Testament language . If you read the first part of it , it 's really the revelation of Jesus Christ . My second daughter wrote a book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things the Book of Revelation teaches about the person of Christ . We sometimes try to symbolize everything , as though it were things we can apply in today 's world . Some of that , I 'm sure , is true , but that 's not something I preach about . <p> . <p> Q : People often use it to try to predict the future . Do you think that 's a wise thing to do ? <p> A : No , I do n't predict the future . Because my future 's leaving pretty fast , and I know that I 'm going to Heaven , and I 'm looking forward to that . I 'd like to go today . <p> . <p> Q : Well , hang on a while . We want to have you back to San Francisco . <p> A : Thank you . I 'll be walking with a cane , probably , because this Parkinson 's does affect me in some ways . <p> . <p> Q : I saw your television broadcast recently , from down in Texas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know , I can sit on a chair , and then when I stand up and grip the podium , I 'm fine . In fact , I feel the power of the Holy Spirit coming in to give me extra strength and thoughts to proclaim the Gospel . But when I sit down again , I 'm somewhat exhausted and sometimes have to be helped . My legs get numb and my feet get very numb . <p> . <p> Q : You 've no doubt seen many miracles during your 50 years as an evangelist  --  the opening of China and the Soviet Union . . . . But what have been some of the lowest points in your ministry ? Have there been times in your life when you 've experienced doubt and frustration ? <p> A : Yes , I get depressed , I have problems , just like other people do : family problems . . . . The greatest problem I face is my own spiritual weakness due to failure reading the Bible as much as I should and praying as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm doing a television program that will be taped and used in Washington for the Promise Keepers . They are having a big march on Washington next month . <p> They asked me to come and be the main speaker , but I told them I could n't do it . I 'm very much in favor of them . I 've never been to one of their meetings . I think they 're doing wonderful work . But I did promise to do a 10-minute talk on tape , and I 'll be the last person up there . I 'm going to urge them to take away from there the idea that we ought to do all these things that they suggest in their literature about being loyal to your wife and so forth , but also that they ought to go out and proclaim the Gospel . <p> It 's all men . I 'll be glad when they include the women . <p> . <p> Q : You 've been a pastor and friend to practically every U.S. president since World War II . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative evangelical movement . But when you look at the presidents in recent decades , Jimmy Carter seems to come off as perhaps the one with the strongest faith of anyone in the White House , and certainly with a very admirable post- Presidential career . What presidents you 've known do you think have the deepest and strongest faith ? <p> A : Do you mean politically ? <p> . <p> Q : No , religiously . <p> A : Oh , I could n't answer that . That would be impossible . You know , many people carry their faith a little bit deeper in their hearts , and do n't put it on their sleeve , and others do . I 've known them privately , and that 's where I have learned a great deal about them , but I would never take one above the other and say , " He is the most spiritual , he is most religious , " because they all have the same problems and they all have the same burdens on them , and I feel sorry for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 14 . He 's been to many of our meetings , and he used to give his tithe to my work . He has probably got as much charisma as any we have had , even John Kennedy . <p> . <p> Q : In the early ' 80s , you were asked about Richard Nixon and the Watergate tapes , and you said you never felt he was using you . Is that how you feel today , that he was sincere ? <p> A : I think he was very sincere , and I think he may go down in history as one of our great presidents , because he had a tremendous vision for America and the future , which he has put in writing in his various books . But what happened in Watergate , I will never really know . Something gave way that I was n't aware of . For example , the language that was used on the tapes was a total surprise to me , and a shock to me . <p> Even after he had left the White House , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Clemente , and I went out and spent rather a long time with him going over his life . And I preached his funeral and preached his wife 's funeral . They were a wonderful couple , and there were so many misunderstandings about him that I 'm sure that historians at some point will straighten out . <p> . <p> Q : Did the Watergate affair change the way you dealt with presidents ? Were you more careful to keep a political distance ? <p> A : Definitely . From that point on , I avoided anything that would even sound political . And I did n't want to be seen on one side or the other . I was born and bred a Democrat , and I 'm still a Democrat , but I 'm really nonpolitical , apolitical . <p> . <p> Q : You were one of the early supporters of the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr . There 's a big debate in California now about affirmative action and whether racial and gender preferences should still be used for hiring and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your views on that ? <p> A : Well , I have n't been here long enough to know  --  I 've seen it in the press , but I would like to know a little bit more about the particular problem in California . I think that we have a long way to go in solving our race problem in America , and I identify with those people who are trying to do something about it . But I do n't want to get into something like affirmative action that I know is a real political issue here . I 'd like to stay away from that . <p> . <p> Q : Another issue getting a lot of attention is the role of women in the church , both in the Catholic Church and many of the Protestant churches . Of course , over the years , many Protestant denominations and the Episcopal Church have been ordaining women as priests and pastors . Do you think women should be allowed to serve as , say , senior pastors in Southern Baptist churches ? <p> A : It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to so many parts of the world and mission fields of the world , where if women did n't do it , there would n't be anybody there to do it . I see nothing in the Bible that would forbid a woman from teaching and preaching . <p> . <p> Q : San Francisco is a city with a large homosexual population , including many gay and lesbian Christians who say that they see God as blessing them and their sexual orientation . What message do you have for gay people ? <p> A : My message is God loves them , and certainly I hope they 'll come in great numbers to our crusades . God loves them , just as he loves everyone else . He wants to come into their lives and give them something deeper than they 'll ever find in any kind of sexual orientation . <p> . <p> Q : We 've been struggling with the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco for about 15 years . Do you see the hand of God in any way in this epidemic ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I think God is in many things in which he 's speaking to us today and warning us about certain things . <p> . <p> Q : There 's renewed interest in the so-called historical Jesus . Scholars are trying to deduce what Jesus really said , and separate what they see as the Jesus of history from the Christ of the Church . Can any good come out of this sort of work ? <p> A : I am an evangelical , and I have accepted Jesus as he is presented in the Bible . No amount of scholarship , no matter how good it looked , or how rational it seemed , would disturb my faith . I base everything I have on faith . I believe . I do n't base it on truth , or science or historical events . I believe the Bible was given to us by God , to guide and direct us in our lives here and to show us the way to Heaven , which of course is through the Cross of Christ . <p> . <p> Q : Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> A : No , I do n't . In fact , when I was in San Francisco 40 years ago , I did n't use it even then . I discarded that word from the very beginning . I 'm sure I would be called a liberal in some areas , especially in social issues . I would be called a conservative in theological areas . <p> . <p> Q : Some people who do call themselves fundamentalists and look at the Bible as historically accurate and without any error can be selective about which parts of the Bible they choose to stress and which they choose to ignore . Jesus said : " Give all your money to the poor , " but few Christians do that . Are n't we all selective in the way we read the Bible ? <p> A : That 's correct . It 's not easy to follow Christ in our modern world , because there is such a variation of belief and teaching . Many people get on the wrong path and they tend to follow cultish leaders sometimes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the world . In India . This is because they do n't have direction . <p> . <p> Q : Many people who think of themselves as believing Christians will say , " Some of the things in the Bible , like the virgin birth , are classic examples of a myth . " Do you think someone can be a Christian and not believe that all these stories are historically true but that they point to a symbolic spiritual truth ? <p> A : Yes , but I think in order to be Christians , we have to believe in the atonement of Christ on the cross for our sins . We have to believe in the resurrection . <p> We also have to believe we need to repent of our sins . Repentance is taught over and over again in the Old and the New Testament . We must come to the cross by faith and receive Christ and let him be the Lord and master of our hearts , and direct our lives . It 's a daily thing , in which we constantly surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers emphasize hell and fire and brimstone in their message . Can a faith based on fear be a healthy faith ? <p> A : I think today there 's too little of it . You do n't find many preachers today preaching on hell . I have n't heard a sermon on hell in years . I do n't think we have to worry about that now , as we did when I first started . Now we need to think about what we need to bring some of that back into our preaching . I do n't get up and talk about the fire and the brimstone and hell , but I warn people that there is a hell to come , and that this hell is primarily a separation from God . <p> . <p> Q : Millions of Latino Catholics in the U.S. and abroad have left the Roman Catholic Church and joined evangelical and Pentecostal churches . What reasons do you see for this ? <p> A : There are a number of cardinals and archbishops in the Catholic Church that have asked me the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope about it , before he went to South America . I told some of them that I felt there had to be more life in the Church . These people are wanting to express their faith because that 's their nature , and it 's the nature of many ethnic groups around the world . They worship God in different ways . <p> . <p> Q : Your son Franklin is in line to succeed you as the leader of your ministry . Yours must be a hard act for a son to follow . How 's he doing ? <p> A : I think he 's doing fine in many ways . He has a great many things to learn , just as I still do , and I 'm very proud of him . It must be remembered that our board of trustees is the final authority , and we are re- elected every year . In fact , if they did n't re-elect me next year , I would n't be the head of our organization . Every year , I have to come for election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : Anything else you 'd like to add ? <p> A : No , other than that it 's with great anticipation that I 'm coming to San Francisco and to the Bay Area again . I have n't been there in years , and I 'm looking forward to all three cities . <p> REV .
