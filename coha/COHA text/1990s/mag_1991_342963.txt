Covering the gulf war is a tough assignment for any journalist , but consider the poor newspaper reporter . Hamstrung by pool restrictions in the field , overshadowed by glamorous TV correspondents , dependent for much of their information on CNN , daily scribes can be excused for feeling a bit underutilized . " A friend took a picture of me the other day taking notes in front of a television set , " says Kim Murphy , who is reporting from Saudi Arabia for the Los Angeles Times . " That 's what being a war correspondent has come to . " <P> Editors back home are grappling with the same kind of problem . In a story so thoroughly dominated by television , the daily press has been the forgotten news medium . Print journalists , of course , have long recognized that TV has changed the rules of their game . But the gulf war is raising anew tough questions about the newspaper 's role in a world where television has become the instantaneous and nearly universal source of breaking news . <P> Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all guns blazing : banner headlines , pages of coverage , reams of special features . And like the networks , they have attracted a bigger audience . The San Francisco Examiner , one of the nation 's few remaining afternoon dailies , has seen its street sales increase 25% since the start of the war . Big-city dailies like the Washington Post ( circ. 781,000 ) and the Philadelphia Inquirer ( circ. 520,000 ) have sold 10,000 to 20,000 extra copies a day . " Obviously , our readers see things first and very dramatically on TV , " says Post managing editor Leonard Downie . " But the information is fragmentary and sometimes contradictory . We think our readers have an appetite the next morning for having it sorted out . " <P> During the first few days of TV 's saturation coverage , newspapers seemed to provide little more than a reiteration of stale news . But the print press has since been playing aggressive catch-up . Last week 's most eye-catching scoop came from Bob Woodward , of Watergate fame , who reported in the Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed that " important parts of Saddam Hussein 's war machine have not yet been significantly hurt . " <P> Newspapers with strong international coverage , like the New York Times and the Christian Science Monitor , have weighed in with stories from around the globe that TV has missed , like a report in the Monitor last week asserting that China had tried to circumvent the embargo against arms shipments to Iraq . Even papers that usually pay little attention to foreign coverage have sent reporters to the gulf region , and several have uncovered fresh news . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Carl Nolte , for example , reported last week that some troops at the front are short of key pieces of equipment and basic items like soap . The Los Angeles Times , which has been offering the most extensive and informative daily coverage of the war , has published a steady stream of enterprising features on such topics as the history of Dhahran and the effort by military lawyers to make sure allied troops obey the rules of war . /      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
