<p> 7 P.M. , VALENTINE 'S DAY <p> In the basement kitchen of her brand-new restaurant in Cleveland Park , Carole Greenwood is breaking a dozen eggs into a large mixing bowl . An even larger bowl of melted Belgian chocolate is at her side , waiting to join the eggs in a flourless espresso cake that is one of Greenwood 's signature desserts . Only hours ago  --  no kidding  --  the restaurant 's final carpet was laid , the walls completely painted , the tables assembled and set , the waiters hired . <p> Upstairs in the ground-level dining room , groups of invited guests are about to dig into the restaurant 's first meal , a sort of trial run before the place officially opens in a few days  --  after the final health inspection takes place , after the liquor license is obtained . Most of the diners are eager to sample the menu because they 're not just customers , they 're Greenwood 's financial backers , and this is the food they signed on to support : Greenwood 's lobster-shrimp cakes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon and garlic over a baked potato . Her vanilla-bean creme brulee . <p> Many if not most chefs dream of their own restaurant . So it 's understandable that the 38-year-old Greenwood wants a place where she can showcase her seasonal cuisine , which highlights locally grown ingredients . But opening a restaurant is the dream of many amateur food enthusiasts as well . In Greenwood at Cleveland Park , the two have come together : Relatively affluent middle-aged couples who want a place with a stylish menu in their neighborhood have joined forces with a chef who knows firsthand that running a restaurant requires much more than good cooking . <p> As nervously enthusiastic as the backers are , as optimistic as the chef is , there 's a sense of the final countdown in the dining room this evening . To get to this night required months of work : getting potential backers to line up behind Greenwood 's food ( by means of a cocktail party and a dinner , backed up by an 18-page limited-liability agreement and a 21-page business plan ) ; finding a location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; planning ( and waiting out ) the construction necessary to transform the quick-service eatery into a sophisticated dining room . <p> The backers have even faced up to the ultimate reality of the restaurant business : In the contractual agreement they signed , they have had to acknowledge that they can afford to lose their entire investment , sums that range from $ 1,000 to $ 25,000 . <p> It 's not the first time a restaurant has come into the world this way and it wo n't be the last . But the characters and story behind Greenwood at Cleveland Park , which opened its doors to the public on Wednesday , Feb. 18 , provide a look at the hard work behind what is seen as a glamorous business . <p> The Chef <p> Carole Wagner Greenwood , who grew up in Washington , had solid experience cooking at some pretty good restaurants  --  Jonathan Waxman 's JAMS in London , Mark Miller 's Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe , Wolfgang Puck 's Postrio in San Francisco , the Tabard Inn and the Belmont Kitchen in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K Street downtown in September 1995 and closed it some 18 months later , on April 1 , 1997 . Nonetheless , she was eager to try again . The biggest mistake of Greenwood on K Street : location . On the second floor of an office mini-mall , it was n't visible from the street . This time she wanted something at street level , preferably a storefront . <p> She also wanted a personal place , where she can cook the way she wants to . Not a solemn food palace . Not a saloon . Not a bar scene . One that 's successful enough for her to hire the staff she needs to make it fly . <p> A neighborhood place . That , she hoped , might provide a loyal clientele and eliminate the fickleness of the downtown scene . <p> And investors ? That might be a good thing . Greenwood emerged from the K Street restaurant a little less than $ 10,000 in debt . But , as she points out , " it was all mine . " <p> The Catalysts <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwood paid attention when investigative attorney Terry Lenzner , a regular customer , began talking about funding a new place for her in his neighborhood , Cleveland Park . Greenwood was open to the idea . " Bethesda was oversaturated , " she says . " In Georgetown the demographics were n't right . " And when Lenzner and his wife , Margaret , brought in another Cleveland Park couple , Eleanor Dunn and her architect-developer husband , Sam , Greenwood came up with a business plan . <p> The Dunns got involved almost by coincidence . Eleanor Dunn , a skilled cook who sometimes catered for friends , had been thinking of opening her own restaurant in the area . Late last spring , when Lenzner started contacting friends to see if they would back Greenwood , one couple said they 'd already agreed to support Dunn . Friends already , the Lenzners and Dunns talked , Lenzner introduced Greenwood to the Dunns , and two paths that might have collided merged instead . Sam Dunn , who already had one restaurant to his credit ( in Telluride , Colo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . And Eleanor Dunn 's enthusiasm for and commitment to the project engaged the interest of other investors . <p> The Nitty-Gritty <p> Greenwood 's year and a half downtown had taught her a lot about the actual costs of business in the District  --  possible rent or mortgage , taxes , labor , utilities , insurance for a new place . Conversations with other restaurateurs in Cleveland Park , Georgetown and Adams-Morgan about net sales versus costs told her she was on track . " I figured dinner sales in the new place would equal lunches downtown , " she says . " That would work . And it was a pretty conservative estimate . " <p> Her business plan laid out financial projections for the restaurant , as well as the concept , the risk factors involved , the way the company was set up and , of course , Greenwood 's experience and personal status ( " mother of Dylan , now 8 , an aspiring Olympic breaststroker " ) . It also explained that Greenwood was borrowing money to cover a portion of the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwood and the investors . <p> The next stage was two-pronged : finding the site and finding the investors . Sam Dunn began investigating a Cleveland Park building for sale , one his wife had spotted while still considering her own business . And everybody started looking for possible backers . <p> On May 19 , the Dunns threw a large cocktail party to encourage potential investors . Showing off the California style she specialized in downtown , Greenwood did the cooking , and talked to the attendees , mostly friends of the Dunns or the Lenzners from the neighborhood . People walked away from the party with a business plan , which at that point involved buying the building under consideration . <p> The Backers <p> Getting started with backing from friends and neighbors has at least one bit of lucky local history : Restaurant Nora got going that way in 1979 . <p> But such enthusiasm by amateurs flies in the face of the facts . " The vast majority of restaurants fail to last five years , " says Bryan Elliott , a restaurant analyst with the Robinson-Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's fairly low-cost to enter , fairly seductive and looks fairly easy from the outside . " And so people keep opening restaurants . And other people keep backing them . <p> " People would call and say , so you think this a good investment ? " says Terry Lenzner , who 's passionate about Greenwood 's cooking . " And I 'd say , ' No , I just think it will be a great restaurant . ' " <p> Such grass-roots backing was n't necessary . Chefs rarely have to go it alone . Greenwood could have joined forces with a speculator , or a commercial landlord . But she thought , " You do n't want to get in bed with someone you do n't know . " Lenzner seemed the best bet . " I knew that he was on my side , " she says . " There were no red flags on him . " <p> After the May cocktail party , investors willing to write a check wanted to sample more of Greenwood 's food . The logical way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The food was unbelievably delicious , " says attorney Gerald Stern , an early supporter whose family had relocated to Washington from California . " Healthy , interesting food is a big to-do out there . " Greenwood 's cooking used East Coast ingredients ( like soft-shell crabs ) , but reminded Stern of the kind of food he 'd enjoyed on the West Coast . <p> Two other ex-California couples immediately signed on . " The effect was contagious , " says Eleanor Dunn . Soon enough a group formed , mostly Washington lawyers , but also a doctor , a lobbyist and a couple of writers . <p> Investment units were sold for $ 1,000 each , some people buying 25 of them , others investing $ 1,000 or $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 . ( Although the final figures are n't in yet , it will have cost about $ 250,000 to $ 300,000 to open the restaurant . ) Holding half the units , Greenwood is the majority member , with responsibility for restaurant-related decisions . Sam Dunn as managing member is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 21 members . The newest member  --  a guest at the Valentine 's Day dinner  --  signed on the next day . <p> The Chef 's Personality <p> When it comes to running their restaurant , chefs are rarely known for their **26;358;TOOLONG attitude . " A restaurant is a benevolent dictatorship , not a democracy , " says Greenwood . <p> So working with backers took some getting used to  --  on both sides . <p> For one thing , there was the issue of how a chef with strong ideas and an occasionally fiery temperament deals with advice from investors who 've never owned , run or worked in restaurants . And there was advice  --  about everything from the arrangement of the tables to how many coats of paint and glaze to use on the walls , from the kind of flooring , to whether to serve food at the bar and how to handle noise . " It 's a fine line , " Greenwood says . " Most of the investors have been very supportive , but they 'll have opinions . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wo n't listen to your input . " <p> Take the case of the decor . A whole slew of folks had been bumping into one another : Dunn and his partners , who organized the space and the bar , interior designer Lucy Bryant , restaurant consultant and " wall artist " Tina Vaughn , Eleanor Dunn and , of course , Greenwood . Disagreements and delays were inevitable , even into the week before the opening . <p> " I finally said , ' Stop , the art in here is the food , ' " says Greenwood . <p> Then there was the question of getting backers to pay up . Not that anybody resisted , but by late January there were some who 'd signed on but still had n't written checks . <p> Dunn became the " closer , " employing tactics such as buttonholing investors looking around the restaurant construction with " Can you just write that check ? " And , presto , it was done . <p> Chef 's Personality , Part 2 <p> Some people do learn from experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with customers ' needs more realistically . Her menu downtown was a local version of contemporary California cooking . Butter and cream were no-no 's ; stylishly presented seafood and vegetables were the focus . The approach was an outgrowth of her personal and political leanings , and a conviction that that kind of food is simply healthier . <p> But over time she 'd realized that it makes better business sense to include chicken and even a steak ( just about the best available , and hormone-free ) on the menu . <p> The Countdown <p> Over the summer , Greenwood and her primary backers realized they could n't  --  and perhaps did n't want to  --  raise the money required to settle on the building they 'd initially targeted . But there was an interesting alternative for rent : the former Kenny Rogers Roasters a block away . Renting was cheaper than buying . Which meant less money to raise . <p> In late October , Greenwood and Dunn signed a 10-year lease on the site , hoping to get the restaurant up and running by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in demolition and construction . The site 's former life presented several chicken-related challenges : A welder had to come in with a cutting torch to remove the massive roaster in the front window bay . The stained ( and smelly ) dropped ceiling had to be removed completely and replaced . <p> At the same time , Greenwood pursued the kitchen equipment . Seventy-five thousand dollars was budgeted , but Greenwood was convinced she could do better by buying some of the stuff used ( remember all those restaurants that keep going out of business  --  they have stoves and dishwashers to sell ) . The final cost : about $ 30,000 . <p> Thanksgiving and Christmas slowed down the construction process . And since countless permits are required for many stages of the process , that schedule was slowed too . <p> The design of the restaurant was another story . With so many people thinking about decor , that process took awhile . And the look of a restaurant has practical consequences . What kind of energy does it give off ? What kind of clients does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide : <p> Did they want a great-looking bar ? Yes . But would it encourage a bar scene ? Maybe . Did they want one ? No . <p> What should be done with a corridor that connects the front bar to the main room in back ? Still unclear . <p> Would booths near the bar be for eating or drinking ? Probably both . <p> So what should they look like ? That was harder . In fact , once the carpentry for those booths was in , Greenwood hated them . Out they came . <p> " It probably extended the opening by about 30 days , " says Sam Dunn . " But we felt it was worth it . " <p> The Opening <p> Even with all the planning that goes into restaurants , they rarely just open . A week or so before an anticipated opening , chefs often do one or more trial runs , known in the trade as a mock service . It 's a way of seeing what needs to be done before the actual opening . Are there enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough espresso cups and wine glasses ? <p> " Some things can be done ahead of time , but you ca n't anticipate everything , " says Greenwood . " It costs a lot , but much less than the overall benefit . It makes you feel more secure . " <p> Greenwood and Dunn hoped to get the restaurant open by Valentine 's Day  --  a very big day for restaurant business . So they scheduled mock services for the week before . But they were n't ready for the final health inspection until Thursday , and they could n't get a license to operate without passing that . When Greenwood called to arrange for an appointment for the next day , the health inspector was on leave until the following Tuesday . They would lose Valentine 's Day business . <p> After initial despair , they regrouped . There would be three mock services : Saturday , Sunday and Monday . And the restaurant would open on Wednesday . Katy Kelsey , the newly hired manager , dealt with the wait staff and bartenders . Greenwood called her purveyors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the go-ahead and , certificate in hand , Dunn went downtown to obtain their restaurant license . In the front window bay , Greenwood stripped off the brown paper that had hidden what was going on inside . And that evening the restaurant opened . <p> Longtime stockbroker Mickey Gordon and his wife , Libby , were the first customers . They live in the Shenandoah Valley but maintain an apartment close by in Cleveland Park , and had been curious about what was behind the brown paper . They 'd been wondering whether they should go out to dinner that night . And then , through the bay window , they spotted white tablecloths . " They make it more first-class , " said Libby Gordon , sitting at the bar before dinner . " We needed something like this here . " <p> Coda <p> Greenwood , who did more dinner business Saturday night than she ever did on K Street , refuses to yield on one thorny issue : customers ' menu substitutions . A baked potato instead of lentils , for instance . Vegetables that are steamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . <p> They 're hard for a small restaurant to handle , she maintains . " When you 're busy , they stop the kitchen dead in its tracks . " And from her point of view , substitutions destroy the integrity of her cooking . " We 'll always offer plain alternatives , like poached salmon and a dry salad , " she says . " But I 'm a very innovative chef . And in Washington , there are a lot of middle-aged conservative people who come in and want what they want . They do n't see things from a culinary perspective . " <p> Does that attitude impact business ? <p> " Yeah , " she acknowledges with a smile . <p> SO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TROUBLE PICKING A WINE ? <p> Virtually all aspects of setting up a restaurant require strategic thinking . Consider what Greenwood and restaurant consultant Tina Vaughn pondered at a tasting to select the wine list : <p> * Her own taste in wine : Greenwood prefers French . <p> * What goes with the menu : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> * Who her customers are ( this is a business after all ) : " My customers love Chardonnay , " she says . But she does n't . The compromise : " If I 'm going to sell them Chardonnay , it 's got to be really good . " <p> * Where to get the wine : Many wholesalers distribute great wines . Her favorite is Sean Tuttle . Why ? He likes her food , ate at her restaurant downtown and gave her great service . <p> * What price range her customers are likely to ante up for <p> * Which wines to sell by the glass ( not only for lunch and dinner but for the bar ) <p> * Which wines , no matter how wonderful , are impossible to get on a regular basis <p> * What off-the-wall circumstances have to be considered : At K Street she noticed that at times there were far more women in the room than men . So lighter , more " female " wines have to be included as well as robust ones .
