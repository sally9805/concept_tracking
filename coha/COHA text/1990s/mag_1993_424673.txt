Why Washington 's power elites wo n't consider single payer health reform <p> Sometime this fall , the Clinton administration will announce its plan to overhaul America 's $900 billion-a-year health care system . For 20 years , this magazine has urged the adoption of a national health insurance plan in which everyone is covered and the government strictly controls costs . Such a system works in Canada , and with careful adaptation , this is a worthy starting point for U.S. health care reform . Yet Washington is paralyzed , unable to consider , let alone adopt , models which require a drastically reduced role for private insurers . In the following section , we explain why the capital 's insider culture pays so little attention to Canada 's experience , which we remain convinced points the way to real reform . Then we offer dramatic solutions that will work whether we keep or reform the present system : First , how to quickly move doctors out of expensive specialities and int general practice , and second , how to efficiently reform Medicare to cost less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew to Washington from his home in Chicago , pleased to have been asked to consult with top White House officials on health care . Young , the past president of Physicians for a National Health Program , was looking forward to plumping for his organization 's favorite cause : Adapting Canada 's national health insurance system to the United States . <p> Young had an attractive case to make : Canada , where provincial governments act as single insurers , annually spends 30 percent less per capita than we do for health care , providing universal coverage , cost controls , and choice of physician . The U.S. fails to insure 37 million people and has no control over rising costs , and a Harvard University survey of 10 nations found that Canadians were the most satisfied with their health-care system ; Americans were the least . <p> But Young 's enthusiasm quickly withered within the White House gates . It turned out , in Young 's words , that he had been invited for " pseudo consultation . " White House staff made it clear that single payer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amazed . A senior White House health adviser , Walter Zelman , put it bluntly : " Single payer is not politically feasible . " <p> In a separate session with Hillary Rodham Clinton , Dr. David Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School ( a close colleague of Young 's ) , also pressed the single-payer point . Canada 's solution , he said , made sense for the United States . Himmelstein 's studies , published in The New England Journal of Medicine since 1986 , show that the U.S. could save as much as $67 billion in administrative costs alone by cutting out the 1,500 private insurers and going to a single government insurer in each state  --  easily enough to pay to cover every uninsured American . <p> Hillary Clinton had heard it all before . How , she asked Himmelstein , do you defeat the multi-billion dollar insurance industry ? " With presidential leadership and polls showing that 70 percent of Americans favor the features of a single-payer system , " Himmelstein recalls telling Mrs. Clinton . The First Lady replied : " Tell me something interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six weeks into the Clinton presidency , the White House had made its key policy decision : Before the Health Care Task Force wrote a single page of its 22-volume report to the President , the single payer idea was written off , and " managed competition " was in . But why should an intelligent First Lady and her 500 health care advisers not want to debate every option , especially examples available from nations that have combined universal access and cost control ? <p> Because in Washington 's political culture , incremental change is the coin of the realm , and a move to single payer is seen as anything but incremental . ( Though in fact , managed competition proposes a more drastic shift in health care delivery for most Americans than single payer does . ) " I 've been in so many meetings in Washington where people say , We 've got to fashion something that 's acceptable to the interest groups , ' " says Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone , one of the few single payer champions . " And I know what groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care and insurance lobbies . " But there 's more to the failure to discuss single payer than lobbyists and their clout . Some politicians fear being caricatured as advocates of " big government " in an age of sound bite politics . And some fear being dismissed as irrelevant for supporting a cause that 's thought to be outside the mainstream . What constitutes the mainstream ? To understand that , consider how the capital 's three established tribes  --  the politicians , the press , and the experts  --  slid single payer off the table without allowing people to decide for themselves whether it should be adopted : First , politicians like Mrs. Clinton fear the bitter , unique opposition of the health insurance industry to single payer . Doctors , hospitals , and health insurers will oppose elements of any reform , but only a single payer plan means the virtual abolition of an entire industry as we know it . Politicians who are reluctant to take on established interests in Washington ( $60 million in medical and insurance PAC contributions since 1980 ) and back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are terrified by the anger that would result from putting health insurers out of business . Combining this with the normal opposition any reform provokes and with a political process that discourages full debate , politicians duck the merits of the issue and dismiss single payer as not feasible . Once this political fact has been established in the hearts and minds of politicians , the people who might be expected to raise out-of-the-mainstream questions  --  reporters  --  are generally too focused on politics , not on substance , to do anything more than reflect prevailing opinion rather than informing it . Finally , the experts who might be expected to rise above the political currents resist seriously appraising Canada for fear of being dismissed as cranks or out-of-touch with realpolitik . Those experts who do argue for single payer are penalized by having to chase research dollars with more difficulty at foundations where insurance executives are a presence . And so it is that an industry which employs 140,000 agents in the U.S. helps kill reform that would help 250 million Americans . <p> There 's the human drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbiosis . Once something is thought to be off the agenda  --  as single payer has appeared to be  --  then it 's death for a Washington player , no matter how established , to keep banging away . Take Rep. Jim McDermott , a Seattle Democrat , who despite years of talking up single payer still feels the sharp dismissiveness of his colleagues and understands why so few people challenge the status quo . A few months ago , McDermott and the rest of his state 's congressional delegation won the coveted invitation to fly with Clinton on Air Force One to the Pacific Northwest 's Timber Summit . In that collegial atmosphere , at the center of power , the politicians congregated around the President in his cabin . <p> McDermott raised his hand , and everyone groaned . " He 's going to ask about single payer again , " they muttered . He was n't , but it did n't matter . " You get stereotyped and people act like they know what you 're thinking and they become dismissive without listening to what you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress in 1988 . " You have to put up with a certain amount of ridicule . This is an issue on which everybody has an opinion . And if you choose the wrong solution , you can be defeated . " <p> The word is out among Democrats in the capital : Positions like McDermott 's , which appear to contradict the Clintons ' approach , are considered disloyal to the new President . More to the point , the conventional wisdom goes , why would any halfway savvy Washingtonian want to fool with something that 's off the table ? Among the politicians and the press , where does this conventional wisdom begin to form ? <p> Welcome to the world of the Sperling breakfast group . In the understated elegance of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel , two blocks from the White House , Washington print reporters meet several times a week with prominent news sources . The event , hosted by The Christian Science Monitor 's Godfrey Sperling Jr. , recalls an older , more genteel era in Washington . Old in style , the setting reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts and words of highly placed sources . <p> Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell dropped by one of these gatherings in July . Even before the waiters brought out the bacon and eggs , the questions turned to health care : Do you favor consideration of Canadian style health reform , the most popular solution among your constituents in Maine ? <p> " No , " Mitchell said bluntly . Canada 's system may be good for Canada , but " it will not be enacted " in Washington . Americans want an American solution . ( A phrase Mrs. Clinton would also use during her working July holiday in Hawaii , sitting poolside with reporters . ) A couple of months before , when Mitchell met with The Wall Street Journal 's lunch group at the same hotel , he outlined the key elements he would like to see in a reformed American health system . His answer was crisp and precise : insurance coverage for all ; controlled costs ; consumer choice of physician and hospital ; renewed emphasis on primary over specialized care ; and flexibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( All of which perfectly describe the Canadian plan . ) <p> When pressed on the point , Mitchell said , " I respect the Canadian system . . . But we ought to select the system that 's based on the practices and standards of our country . When very wealthy people  --  kings and prime ministers and others of means  --  in other countries get sick , they do n't go to Canada . They do n't go to Germany . They do n't go to Japan . They come to the United States . " Reporters at the Sheraton dutifully recorded Mitchell 's words . Never mind that foreign leaders regularly use their own systems in Germany , Japan , Canada , and elsewhere . Never mind that just a few years ago , Mitchell 's Senate colleague , the late Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii , went to Canada for new , high-tech cancer treatments that were unavailable in the U.S. <p> With such broad agreement on what health reform should provide , why do n't the Canadian or the German or the Australian systems get more seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this means mostly fear of political attack , fear of taking on powerful American myths ' and fear of incurring the wrath of the well-endowed health care and insurance industries . And politicians fear being left out of the game . That means they talk the prevailing talk , and think the prevailing thoughts , instead of realistically appraising proposed reforms or genuinely evaluating foreign experience . <p> Mitchell is well aware of the power of advertising to defeat single payer advocates . His Republican colleague from Maine , Senator William Cohen , beat a Democratic challenger in 1990 in the nation 's first election to turn almost entirely on health reform . Cohen 's opponent , Neil Rolde , openly championed the Canadian-style system , but Cohen 's campaign was guided by Republican pollster Bill McInturff , a clever conservative with an uncanny knack for packaging effective attacks . <p> " We trashed the hell out of the Canadian system , " McInturff recalled . Foreshadowing the tack Bush took in his own re-election campaign , McInturff described how he planned ads attacking national health insurance with footage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is your health care system if we go to a national plan . " McInturff 's GOP strategy rightly assumed that voters associate Democrats with big government , high taxes , and bureaucratic hassles . So McInturff shrewdly responded to a Democratic national health proposal by raising the specter of big government run amok , linking Canada with this dismal image . And McInturff was among those who recommended a line that Bush would later use in 1992 : Universal health insurance , the President said , would operate " with the efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service and the compassion of the KGB . " <p> But Clinton , as usual , was a step ahead of Bush  --  and , by extension , of McInturff . In the Democratic primary campaign , Clinton regularly referred to what we could learn from the experience of other nations . But in the general election campaign , Clinton suddenly adopted the phrase " managed competition " to define his variant of health insurance reform . Few understood then or now what he meant , but no one  --  especially political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed " foreign ideas on the good old U.S. of A. <p> The institutional pressure on politicians to play it safe is powerfully dramatized in the cautious attitude of a reformer elected with Clinton : Rep. Bobby Rush of Chicago . In 1992 , Rush , a former Black Panther , campaigned as an advocate of Canadian style reform . But once introduced to the pressures of Washington , his former supporters claim he became skittish about co-sponsoring a single payer solution . Rush shocked Quentin Young and others by refusing to co-sponsor Jim McDermott 's single payer bill in the House . Rush told supporters , including Young , that as part of leadership ( House Speaker Tom Foley had made Rush a freshman whip ) it would be difficult for him to support a non-administration bill , and that important supporters ( medical , hospital , and insurance PACs donated $13,750 to Rush 's campaign ) would also not understand if he went along with the single payers . Outraged Chicago health activists who had supported Rush pressed him hard , and eventually he signed on . A Rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he considered a complex subject and did not delay because of other pressures . But when the tribal need to be accepted as part of the system is so strong that someone like Rush hesitates , it 's little wonder that politicians of lesser proven conviction slip so readily into complacency . No , Canada <p> So if politicians fear treading in the single payer arena , why are n't journalists learning and talking about Canada and other foreign experience ? Why are discussions of these matters relegated to largely arcane academic journals and occasional features ? To be sure , there are thoughtful mainstream pieces from time to time . This July , The New York Times ran a detailed article explaining the advantages of Ontario 's system of caring for the elderly . The Philadelphia Inquirer ran an extensive three-part series in April comparing Canadian , German , and American patient care . <p> But most of the time , almost any news story in Canada about waiting lists , a disappointed physician , or the lack of funds for doctors or hospitals finds its way into congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the digging and journalists do the disseminating . Because America 's journalistic ethic of quoting both sides gives equal space to those who praise Canada and those who criticize it , articles repeat myths about Canada without analyzing them . <p> For example , in March , The New York Times ran a major front page piece headlined : " Patients Footing the Bill Amid Canadian Cutbacks : Spending Outstrips Government 's Ability to Pay . " Read beyond that alarming head and there was quite different news : The Canadian system is widely popular and 95 percent of all Canadians reported receiving the care they needed within 24 hours . The cutbacks ? The Canadian government had decided not to reimburse its citizens any longer for electrolysis removal of unwanted hair . <p> A search of 100 health care articles in The Washington Post since April found that only 10 percent dealt substantially with Canada ; 70 percent focused on leaks from the Health Care Task Force and on the political implications of the Clinton plan . Only three focused critically on managed competition . A cover story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunch hitting Canada 's system . The cover art ? Bill and Hillary as Adam and Eve in a health care Garden of Eden looking at a half-eaten Canadian apple . The headline ? " The Model is Tempting , But . . . . " The lead ? Canadians " know well how expensive it is to run a national system with universal coverage : They have one and evidence is mounting that they ca n't afford it . " This makes little sense . Costs have risen over the past decade in Canada but nowhere near the rate U.S. costs have . So if we have nonuniversal coverage and spend 14 percent of GNP , how can a system with universal coverage that costs 9 percent of GNP illustrate the point that Canadians " know well how expensive it is to run a system with universal coverage ? " Viewing the U.S. from Canada reveals exactly the opposite : It shows how expensive it is not to have universal coverage and cost constraints . <p> Why do things like this get into print ? First , there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the health systems of other developed democracies to know that the lessons thought peculiar to Canada are in fact quite general . Germany , France , Japan , Australia , and Canada all combine universal coverage with budget limits and considerable bargaining power in the hands of payers . Second , there 's the matter of drama . ( In mainstream journalism , bad news is always more interesting than good news . ) So for dramatic reasons , even when stories explaining the benefits of Canadian or European systems do appear , they tend to be underplayed . For example , when the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) reported in May that a single payer system could provide universal health care and still cut costs by $14 billion a year , the Post ran a single column story inside the paper that never referred to Canada . A second CBO report in July saying that a Canadian style plan would save more money than any other proposal  --  including managed competition  --  ran on page A15 . <p> There are other factors at work here , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenge the statements of public officials . During the 1992 campaign , for example , Paul Tsongas flatly dismissed the idea of national health insurance . Dramatically , Tsongas said he might be dead today if he had been living in Canada because the medical technology that saved his life from cancer was unavailable there . But it was not true . In fact , the treatment Tsongas needed was developed by Toronto doctors and is available to Canadians with little or no delay from the surgeons who helped invent it . At the time , most reporters never bothered to check whether Tsongas ' remark were true ; The New Yorker and The Chicago Tribune followed up and told readers that a major presidential aspirant did n't know what he was talking about . <p> Why are n't more reporters and news organizations up there examining the system for themselves ? Why do they fail to investigate exaggerated complaints and underplay positive reports ? They are n't corrupt or bought off by the insurance industry . The more compelling explanation is less scandalous , but more serious . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is not politically feasible . " Over and over again , they hear that Canada is not the perfect system advocates make it out to be . These messages do not come solely from the spoonfeeding at lunch and breakfast meetings . Most importantly , once health care becomes a political issue , it is assigned to political reporters , not medical reporters , and the politicos naturally judge everything through a " can-this-pass " filter . And reporters , confronting a complicated subject , are generally afraid of asking questions when they think the answers must be obvious to everybody else . Politicians and interest group spokesmen can therefore spin like tops , using statistics and scenarios that the reporters do n't know enough to challenge . <p> Even the " MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , " which makes unusual efforts to air the full range of health care opinion , dramatizes the problems . In May , health reporter Stuart Schear arranged a four-guest debate on single payer versus managed competition . One of the managed competition critics mysteriously dropped his opposition on the air , leaving only Dr. Steffie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the Canadian case . At the end of the interview , MacNeil noted that Woolhandler was in the minority and then asked : " If this managed competition is the program that has political consensus and the other one that you advocate single payer is considered impossible politically at the moment , why are you then against the one that is viable and would produce a large amount of reform ? " <p> While Woolhandler rejected the assumption that managed competition would produce meaningful reform , MacNeil 's question  --  designed as it may have been to elicit an interesting response  --  reinforced the impression that single payer was simply not feasible . Health snare <p> If most politicians dwell in fear of insurance industry enmity and political irrelevance , and if most reporters ingest that view without thinking , then where are we ? Where can reporters and moderate and liberal politicians turn in the health care debate ? Quick  --  to the Rolodex . How about the outside experts ? <p> Unfortunately , the cultural imperatives that shut down political and journalistic inquiry are also at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as out of touch as much as the politicians and the press . Take Henry Aaron , the highly-regarded senior economist at the Brookings Institution , whose 1991 book on health care , Serious and Unstable Condition , was widely noted in Washington . Aaron 's book painstakingly reviews our troubled " condition , " reports the experience of other industrial democracies , and then outlines a solution which in fact reflects principles applied abroad . But he devotes just one paragraph to Canada , and his proposed solution builds on private insurance . Intellectually honest , Aaron almost apologetically explains his surrender to presumed political constraint : " Although a wholly public plan probably could achieve some additional savings . . . my plan is predicated on the unwillingness of Congress to shift the bulk of currently private health care arrangements for most Americans . " No one wants to be left out . <p> And some say there appears a financial price to be paid if one goes too far beyond what is regarded as the conventional wisdom . Consider the case of David Himmelstein , an authority on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . His studies , conducted with Woolhandler , appear regularly in The New England Journal of Medicine and , though controversial , have been used by the General Accounting Office , journalists , and congressional committees to compare health systems . Yet their research has been done on a shoestring : The two doctors actually had to pool their academic salaries to pay research expenses . ( And though the research is cited , it 's not generally understood and runs into the journalistic he said/she said confusion . ) <p> Private funding for research on single payer systems is far more difficult to find than money for other kinds of health care research , Himmelstein says , unless you make clear that conclusions will be negative . " Our personal experience is that research that may show the superiority of a single payer system is somewhere between difficult and impossible to fund , " Himmelstein said . In 11 years , their only funded project was " only indirectly related to single payer work . " Himmelstein has been complaining of bias for years . One foundation vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be funded . " There is a person on our board , " the foundation official said , " who will veto any proposal that would lead to the abolition of the health insurance industry . A specific piece of research that leads to the implication that the health insurance industry should be done away with is completely unfundable . " Himmelstein looked around and saw that most of the foundation boards he was applying to had members connected to the insurance industry . <p> Of course , serious students of single-payer systems can be funded ( full disclosure : both authors of this article have been ) ; it 's just harder , and that 's important . Inside Washington , experts tend to play the game as it 's played by the politicians and the press : Focus on the possibilities of the moment . For that reason , both Brookings and the Urban Institute , the respectable left-of-center think tanks , now largely ignore single payer plans . So there is an imbalance with important implications : Reformers suck up to the " feasible , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacerbate the problem . <p> The upshot of this systematic relationship between journalists , politicians , and experts is confusion about Canada , not clarification of its enduring strengths and weaknesses . Sound bite journalism  --  electronic and print , featuring snippets of contradictory claims  --  has obscured the fact that Canada , although recently suffering from recession , has managed to satisfy most of its citizens in ways we should marvel at and learn from rather than dismiss . <p> by Tom Hamburger and Ted Marmor <p> <p> Tom Hamburger is the Washington bureau chief of the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
