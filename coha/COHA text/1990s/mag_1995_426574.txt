Section : Defense &; Technology <p> LAST summer the General Accounting Office set off a mini-firestorm on Capitol Hill when it reported that the Clinton Administration 's Future Years Defense Program ( FYDP , or , in Pentagon parlance , the fiddip ' ' ) could be underfunded by $150 billion or more over fiscal years 1995 - 99 . Some observers suggested that the defense program was headed for a train wreck '  --  a precipitous decline in the effectiveness of U.S. military forces . By last summer the Administration conceded that , by its own estimates , the defense program was underfunded by nearly $50 billion . <p> Following the congressional elections , President Clinton took steps that the Administration claimed would eliminate the mismatch ' between programs and funding , primarily through a combination of cuts in defense modernization ( $8 billion ) , more favorable assumptions regarding future inflation ( $12 billion ) , and increased funding ( $25 billion ) . The President 's action purportedly provided sufficient resources to achieve the two top priorities : maintaining U.S. forces ' readiness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters , Air Force cargo aircraft , and Navy attack aircraft . <p> While many defense experts agree that the Administration has maintained the near-term readiness of U.S. forces , they are concerned that this is being accomplished at the expense of long-term readiness , by dipping into the funds originally earmarked for modernization and or recapitalization . Indeed , defense recapitalization rests on three weak reeds . First , DoD hopes that major savings will be realized from acquisition reform . Yet historically such savings have been notoriously elusive . Second , DoD assumes that , over time , base closures will yield billions in savings . Yet such savings have been slow to materialize . Third , and perhaps most important , the DoD hoped it would realize small but steady real increases in its budget beyond the FYDP . <p> By January the Congressional Budget Office was reporting to the new Republican Congress that , even taking into account the President 's moves , it estimated a program - funding mismatch of $47 billion over FY1996 - 99 . Even within the Administration , concerns were growing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's modernization program , said : The Army has no modernization program . ' The outlook for the other services is not much brighter . The Navy finds itself with projected annual shortfalls of $3 to $5 billion in its shipbuilding accounts . Marine leaders recently testified before Congress that their modernization budget must increase dramatically if they are to remain faithful to the Administration 's two-regional-war strategy and our overseas-presence commitments . And the Air Force finds itself abandoning investment in bombers and close air support as it pours increasingly scarce dollars into modernizing its fighter force . <p> CONGRESSIONAL Defense Hawks started the new session in January hoping to erase the mismatch . They argued that , while the Administration 's plan for FY1996 - 2001 calls for spending $1.6 trillion on defense , it also reduces defense spending by 7 per cent in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms over that period . The Defense Hawks hoped to keep funding at today 's levels , adding more than $130 billion to the Administration 's FY1996 - 2001 program . This might be enough both to erase the mismatch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ballistic-missile defense . <p> But politics on the Hill is no longer a matter of Defense Hawks battling Domestic Doves ( those members who favor increasing the relative emphasis on domestic programs ) . There is a new dominant breed of political animal in Congress : the Deficit Hawks , whose ranks include the overwhelming majority of the 74 Republican freshman . While many also call themselves Defense Hawks they are , as Newt Gingrich puts it , Cheap Hawks . ' They see themselves as coming to Washington to balance the federal budget , reduce the size of government , and , if there is any money left over , put it back into the pockets of the American people in the form of tax cuts . For them , defense is a priority , but it is not a top priority . <p> In the early budget skirmishes , the Deficit Hawks are clearly in the ascendant . While the budget plans put forward by John Kasich ( R. , Ohio ) and Pete Domenici ( R. , N.M. ) add $24 billion to the Administration 's defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to only a 1 per cent increase . Thus defense spending will continue its decline , only at a more graceful pace . For those concerned about the program - budget mismatch , the news is also disappointing . At least so far , Congress seems more interested in mandating new defense programs ( e.g. , the B2 bomber , Marine amphibious assault ships ) than in covering existing shortfalls . Furthermore , under the Administration 's plan to balance the budget , defense spending , which has fallen 35 per cent in real terms since FY1985 , would fall another 16.5 per cent by FY2005 . ( The Republican plan , while extending only to 2002 , projects a similar decline . ) <p> In revealing his budget plans , President Clinton confirmed what many independent analysts had suspected : projected defense funding is clearly insufficient to support the Administration 's Bottom-Up Review ( BUR , or burr ' in defense-speak ) program , which calls for a force of 1.45 million active-duty troops , including 10 Army divisions , 3 Marine divisions , 12 carrier battle groups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously , two major regional conflicts of the magnitude of the Gulf War . The FYDP underfunding estimates would not have been especially worrisome  --  if defense planners could have counted on real increases in defense spending beyond 2001 . But this is no longer the case . Estimates are that , by 2005 , the mismatch between the BUR requirements and the Clinton budget could reach $55 billion per year . And the outlook for the BUR Republican budget projections is no less gloomy . As one senior Pentagon official observed , The Bottom-Up Review is dead . We are just waiting until after the elections to bury it . ' <p> Under these circumstances , it can hardly be surprising that the brief period of Defense Hawk optimism following the Republican victory in November has dissipated , and that talk among Washington insiders has returned to the defense train wreck . ' To many of those involved in the debate , the presence of a program - funding mismatch on the order of $50 to $100 billion over the next six years , and the prospect that defense budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FY2002 does seem to point to a collapse of military capabilities . <p> The good news is that , notwithstanding the mismatch and declining defense budgets , the United States might well be able to provide an effective defense capability over the long term . Yet the mismatch is clearly cause for concern . Among other things , it leads to inefficient planning  --  for example , wasteful spending on research and development programs which ultimately must be cancelled when it turns out that funding is not available to push planned systems into production . <p> Of course , the existence of a project - funding mismatch tells us nothing about whether the real problem is one of underfunding or overprogramming . Historically , gaps between plans and available resources have been the norm . For instance , in 1984 the GAO estimated that the FY1984 - 88 Reagan defense plan might suffer from a gap of $324 billion . Similarly in 1989 , the GAO estimated that the FY1990 - 94 Bush plan might exceed projected funding levels by as much as $150 billion . In the past such mismatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in operations and support programs  --  have generally been resolved by scaling back plans rather than by adding funding . <p> Likewise , a strong argument can be made that currently projected levels of funding would be sufficient to sustain an effective U.S. military capability over the long term , if prudent additional reductions were made in the size of the planned force structure and planned rates of modernization . The United States no longer faces a superpower rival that is steadily developing new weapons and modernizing its forces . Furthermore , unlike during the Cold War , today no other country in the world spends anything close to what the United States spends on military R &D.; While U.S. funding for new weapons procurement has dropped significantly since the 1980s , so too have new-weapons purchases by most of the rest of the world  --  including rogue states like Iran and North Korea . <p> In short , although resources may be tight , there is little reason to believe that the continued decline projected for defense funding should , in and of itself , cause a train wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . The bad news is that there is reason to believe that the funding provided is being poorly invested . The culprit is the Administration 's so-called strategic blueprint , the BUR . In short , we have focused too much on the traditional question of How much is enough ? ' without asking the equally important question , What should we be spending it on ? ' <p> THE new Congress , which is charged with responsibility for appropriating the funds that will shape a coherent strategic investment portfolio , faces a challenge that , in one sense , is far more demanding than the challenge confronted by its predecessors during the Cold War . <p> Today , senior policy officials  --  both in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill  --  must make investment decisions under conditions of far greater uncertainty . During the Cold War we knew the challenger ( the Soviet Union ) , the focus of the challenge ( primarily Europe ) , and its nature . A lot of investments merely involved baselining ' ourselves against the Soviets . To be sure , the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cold War . But how do we craft an investment plan when it is not clear which great power or regional power will pose the next major security challenge ? Or when that challenger may choose to compete ? <p> Steps taken to minimize the risk to our immediate vital interests in  --  say the Persian Gulf and East Asia  --  take away from our ability to lower long-term risks . Unlike during the Cold War , the most dangerous challenges to our security will likely come over the long term . Thus , given that resources for defense are relatively fixed , it is important to avoid investing any more than is absolutely necessary in buying military capability against relatively low-level immediate threats at the expense of readiness for longer-term challenges . What are these challenges ? <p> They are likely to manifest themselves in two forms : first , a revived competition among the great powers ; and second , and more proximate , a far more virulent strain of rogue state . If the patterns of history hold , the current level of cooperation among the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that a great-power competitor to the United States will appear in the near term , as it did after World War II . Nor would such a competitor , if and when it appears , be at all likely to present a challenge of the same type and magnitude as did the Soviet Union . But it is likely that a great-power competitor will appear . <p> Although the Pentagon asserts it is preparing for the future , its BUR strategy ' employs a single scenario highly reminiscent of the Gulf War to plan and structure U.S. forces for the next ten to twenty years . Unfortunately , rogue states are not trying to reconstruct Iraq 's Republican Guard ; rather , they are selectively exploiting the growing range of increasingly sophisticated arms available in today 's buyer 's market . ' The combination of a handful of new military tools ( including weapons of mass destruction ) and different operational concepts could present a very different  --  and far more potent  --  rogue-state challenge early in the next decade than Iraq posed in Desert Storm . <p> Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital interests , the U.S. military ( and defense budgets ) should be restructured to support a strategy that accords a high priority to preventing or postponing the emergence of the most dangerous challenges and , of course , to meeting these challenges successfully if preventive measures fail . <p> Finally , the rapid advance of new technologies promises to alter , fundamentally , the character and conduct of conflict by stimulating the emergence of entirely new kinds of military operations . The prospect that a military revolution is now under way only adds to the level of uncertainty faced by defense planners . A strategy to hedge against this uncertainty requires a willingness to experiment , to innovate , and to be tolerant of failure . It does not require large-scale production of many new systems ; nor does it require major new additions to the force structure . In short , it does not require that we think richer ' about defense  --  rather , it requires that we think smarter . ' <p> THE new Republican Congress , absorbed in the debate over the Administration 's mismatch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense program . Congress needs to avoid merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Bottom-Up Review . For Defense Hawks on both sides of the political aisle , the silver lining is that , if they can meet the challenge of replacing the BUR with a defense program that reflects the changing security environment and the emerging military revolution , they can realize a more effective defense without compromising deficit reduction . <p> How can this be accomplished ? The United States needs an investment strategy that hedges against uncertainty by building a range of strategic options into the budget that can be exercised as needed , depending upon how the security environment develops over the long term . The current defense posture , as depicted in the BUR , relies upon a single scenario to size and structure U.S. forces . This approach assumes away uncertainty , rather than accounting for it . Yet our prospective future competitors , be they rogue states or great powers , are likely to compete very differently from the way Iraq did in 1990 . <p> A proper hedging strategy would : <p> Balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long term with available resources . The Pentagon should reduce its force structure to 1.2 million active-duty personnel , with proportional reductions in the reserves and Defense Department civilian personnel . This would still provide the capability to wage one Gulf War - style regional conflict in the near term , while providing sufficient funds to recapitalize the force over the long term . <p> Engage in vigorous experimentation , testing , and evaluation . Experiments during the 1920s and ' 30s with new , rapidly developing technologies produced Admiral Halsey 's carrier battle groups and General Patton 's air - land mechanized team , which paid enormous dividends during World War II . Experimentation is needed today to determine how rapidly emerging technologies  --  especially information technologies  --  are altering the character of conflict , and how the U.S. military must adapt to maintain its competitiveness . <p> Fortunately , funding innovation does not have to bust the budget . What is most critical is how the funding is being allocated . For example , experiments with programs that have potentially huge long-term payoffs  --  such as fielding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and testing dramatically different surface-combatant designs ( such as the Navy 's arsenal ship and small combatant ) , and developing unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) webs ' ( architectures )  --  can be undertaken at modest cost ( a combined $1 billion per year , or less than 3 per cent of the R &D; budget ) . <p> Restructure capital-stock investments . During the Cold War the United States faced a major competitor , the Soviet Union , which aggressively attempted to improve upon its capital stock of planes , tanks , ships , guns , etc . Change was , for the most part , evolutionary . This is no longer the case . <p> The current combination of relatively modest near-term challenges , rapid technological change , and an uncertain future suggests that the next few years offer a good opportunity to experiment with military systems rather than to invest heavily in replacing our existing defense capital stock with new generations of equipment that offer only marginal improvements . <p> Relatively greater emphasis should be given to upgrading existing systems , or replacing them with upgraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon might introduce new systems gradually , and sustain them at low rates of production . This approach would allow for relatively greater emphasis on experimenting with a broader array of systems . <p> Rather than cut further into R &D,; Congress may want to consider reducing the size of our force structure , and using the savings to ensure increased emphasis on experimentation and innovation . This involves reducing existing capital stock in the near term to create long-term advantages . Put another way , it involves accepting some increased risk in the near term , when the danger is relatively low , in order to lower our risks over the long term , when the danger is likely to be substantially greater . <p> Fortunately , the Defense Department is well positioned to exploit the potential of newly emerging technologies . But it can not be done within the Bottom-Up Review , which both is unaffordable and seeks to create a U.S. military that is essentially a smaller incarnation of its Cold War/Desert Storm ancestor . What is needed is a very different geopolitical and military-technical conception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century when faced with similar circumstances : We are running out of money . We shall have to start to think . ' <p> CARTOON <p> By ANDREW KREPINEVICH <p> <p> Mr. Krepinevich is director of the Defense Budget Project . <p>
