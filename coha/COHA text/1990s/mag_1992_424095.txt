Section : UNCOMMON SENSE Making the most of the changing seasons <p> Sleet drums against the windowpanes , and the sanding truck has made its second pass up and down the hill . The wood stoves are all going . We have closed up the barn and sheds , oiled the tools , filled the kerosene lamps , and generally tucked ourselves in for the winter . We are like bears , we tell our friends : We 're not actually hibernating , just sleeping a lot . When the sun comes back up , so will we . <p> Our bearishness is a matter of personal choice . There are enough heated swimming pools and indoor tennis courts within a short drive to offer an endless summer . And there is no shortage of fresh produce at the supermarket . For a cook , the seasons have become so homogenized that the calendar has lost its importance . Seedless grapes , celery , red peppers , oranges , and tomatoes are always for sale , no matter what the thermometer says . <p> We , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our garden shuts down , the way the snow blows across the vegetable patch , catches on the dormant grapevines , and piles on the bare branches in the orchard . For once , nothing needs picking . There are no pole beans getting too big , no raspberries about to drop to the ground , no broccoli in danger of going to flower . From March to September , from one equinox to the next , we race to keep up with the garden . Now , in the lee of the year , we are finally sitting down . <p> The last of our tomatoes was eaten weeks ago  --  the end of a bushel of full-size green fruits that I picked by flashlight as the temperature plummeted , then let ripen indoors . But I 'm not about to reach for the tomatoes in the supermarket , even if they were picked and ripened in much the same way . We 've had our fresh tomatoes for this year . <p> In part what deters me from buying fresh produce in winter is the cost . Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been estimated that half the trucks on the interstates are hauling food or other agricultural products . In the Northeast most of the fresh fruits and vegetables available in winter come from California and Florida . Some come from still farther away  --  from Mexico , Chile , South Africa , Australia , and New Zealand . Winter in the Northern Hemisphere , after all , means summer in the Southern . But this long-distance transportation  --  whether by tractor trailer , railroad car , container ship , or airplane  --  consumes roughly two thirds the amount of energy that went into growing the crops in the first place . <p> I also have concerns about pesticide residues on produce from abroad . While the alarm may have been raised by United States producers trying to protect their markets from foreign competition , there is no way of knowing whether chemicals that have been banned in this country are coming back in on imported fruits and vegetables . It 's certainly possible , considering there is so little inspection at the border , a crate here , and a crate there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New England annually imports 85 percent of its fruit and vegetable supply is that this depresses local production . More and more of the grocery stores selling California tomatoes in December will still be selling California tomatoes in August , ignoring the tomatoes that are ripe in their own backyard . Roadside stands and farmer 's markets are becoming the only way to get a taste of local produce short of growing it yourself . <p> Some of the growers hereabouts are trying to compete by raising lettuce , cucumbers , and tomatoes inside greenhouses , artificially stretching the summer season . But as enjoyable as it is to be inside a greenhouse while an icy wind howls outside , this is a marginal pursuit given the amount of fuel and attention it takes to maintain temperatures so high inside walls so thin . <p> Not living in California or Florida , I find it simpler to recognize winter for what it is  --  season without much fresh produce , a season in which our diet consists of food that has been put away for just this time . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-June to mid-October . These four months sustain us for the other eight . I do n't want to give the impression that we are self-sufficient agrarians . We buy milk , bread , cheese , and olives , patronizing the supermarkets as often as the rest of the population . But we do n't spend much time in the produce aisles . <p> Instead we go into winter with a well-stocked larder . Quart jars of vegetable chili , spiced pears , dill pickles , and raspberry jelly crowd our shelves . These are not as elegantly packed as those on display at the county fair each September ; nevertheless , they are summer captured behind thick glass . Canning has played an important role in home economics since its invention at the start of the 19th century by the Frenchman Nicolas Appert . Despite tales of botulism and pressure-cooker explosions , it is safe , simple , and reliable . You do n't even have to grow the food you can or can the food you grow . For several years now we have been sharing our garden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook than weed . We grow it , she puts it in jars , we divide the result , and two families are fed . <p> Freezing is even easier than canning , and it comes closer to preserving the flavor , texture , and color of fresh foods  --  witness the superiority of frozen peas and beans over their canned counterparts . Freezers have one great limitation , however : They need regular inputs of electricity to keep their contents below zero . Every time I hear one of our freezers turn on in the night I know the meter is running . <p> That is why the storage technique we depend on most is common storage . Common storage is easier than freezing or canning . Electrical outages do n't result in disastrous thawing , and there is no need to sterilize the food first . Common storage works on the principle that to keep a broad spectrum of unbruised and unblemished fruits and vegetables well , you simply need to keep them cool . And coolness is something that we have ample amounts of at this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the root cellar . With so many heated , dehumidified , and well-lit basements around , most homeowners have forgotten the merits of one that is cold , damp , and dark . The ideal root cellar has a moist earthen floor and a temperature that hovers just above freezing . We had to hunt around with a maximum-minimum thermometer to find ours : the cellar bulkhead . By lining the bulkhead doors with insulation and closing the interior door to the cellar , we found we had a space that is largely underground and hovers around 35 degrees Fahrenheit . In the bitterest weeks we open the inner door a crack to let a trace of the furnace heat into the space . <p> Here I store the 100 or so pounds of carrots that we harvest in October on Columbus Day , pulling their tops off and packing them in layers of damp sand in rodent-proof metal trash barrels . They will still be remarkably fresh tasting , crisp , and sweet until mid-June . I am , of course , simply mimicking the conditions of carrots left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those gardeners who have successfully overwintered their carrots by mulching them heavily enough so that the ground never freezes often discover when they pull back the mulch that mice have tunneled down the row and eaten every one . Parsnips and Jerusalem artichokes are the only vegetables that I confidently leave in the ground all winter long . <p> Carrots , cabbages , turnips , beets , potatoes , and witloof chicory all go into the root cellar . The witloof chicory , or Belgian endive , gets packed in sand like the carrots , but the other vegetables stay moist enough in the humid atmosphere to not warrant such treatment . I leave the stems and roots on the heads of cabbage . While the outer leaves of each head get papery , the lateral buds along the stalks begin to sprout , so by late winter we are enjoying the etiolated , blanched stems and leaves of this second growth in our salads . <p> I pack the roots of the witloof chicory upright in sand . Every couple weeks I take five or six roots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cover the container with a black plastic bag , and bring it upstairs where the temperature is 60 to 70 degrees . In a couple weeks , fresh blanched chicons are ready to cut and serve . It may not be entirely correct to consider them a stored harvest , since , like the cabbage sprouts , they have grown anew . <p> I could store the apples in the root cellar as well , but there is n't enough room . Instead I leave them in the main part of the cellar in bushel baskets and wooden crates . There the temperature drops as low as 40 degrees , and the apples keep very well . Apples for storage should be winter varieties . Our Stayman Winesap ' apples ripen just before freezing weather but will still be sound enough for pies and sauce in late April . <p> Onions and garlic , by contrast , need an environment that is dry and cool rather than damp and cool . I braid our Stuttgart ' onions early each September and hang them up so they get ample ventilation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Temperatures as warm as 50 in the winter do n't seem to harm them . Even if I do n't plan on serving onions , I occasionally fry one up when I am cooking to whet people 's appetites . <p> Our winter squash get picked at maturity and laid immediately in shallow boxes cushioned with crumpled newspaper or hay so that they do n't get scratched or bruised . The squash then spend a couple of weeks curing in the sun before being put in a place that is warm and dry . Temperatures below 50 degrees , while fine for all other vegetables , cause squash to decay rapidly . The space under the bed has proved to be both easy to reach and 55 to 60 degrees most of the winter . There Waltham Butternut ' squash keep in perfect condition from one harvest to the next . <p> This is n't to say that a squash that has been off the vine for 10 months tastes as good as one picked more recently . But much of our stored produce tastes just as good or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even hardy kiwifruits improve in flavor after harvest because they contain starch that converts to sugar . Potatoes in storage develop a corky outer skin that makes them vastly superior to new potatoes for baking . We put several inside a simple metal box-oven set atop a wood stove and let them cook slowly all morning until they are soft and squishy inside their tough leathery shells . <p> Winter here is the season for pumpkin pies , stewed tomatoes , and onion soup . It is not the time to be buying strawberries , red peppers , or asparagus . Yes , by spring we will be a bit tired of potatoes , sauerkraut , applesauce , and New England boiled dinners . But that only makes spring the more welcome . <p> For every fruit , every vegetable has a time of natural abundance , a time when it is both plentiful and tasty . The diversity of recipes that exist for everything from fresh cucumbers to strawberries is a result of the seasonal glut faced by cooks . Someone who buys a precious half-pint of raspberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet in January is n't likely to experiment with making something exotic like raspberry vinegar or soup . <p> Last summer we gorged ourselves on sour cherries , plunged into the ripe peaches , and emerged from the blackberry patch stained and smiling . These were all fruits that we waited to pick until they had achieved a level of perfection never to be tasted in a fruit that has been harvested weeks early , handled by machine , and transported great distances . We overdosed on asparagus , sugar snap peas , and roast corn . And now we are curiously content . We still have plenty of good things to eat , food we grew ourselves and put away . The perishable delights of summer we remember perfectly clearly . There is no need to buy their pale , expensive counterparts . Of all the ways of storing food that have been devised over the centuries , the memory of past pleasures is perhaps the most efficient of all . <p> TABLE <p> PHOTO : Shelves of canned fruits and vegetables ( TOMAS HOVLAND/GRANT HEILMAN ) <p> By Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this magazine . <p>
