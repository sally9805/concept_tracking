Section : BODY MAKEOVERS <p> <p> When her husband was transferred from Kentucky to Florida , Janis Blevins at age 39 became so depressed she quit her job , stopped going out and began to binge on Big Macs . Within a few years the 5 ' 3 " , 120-pound mother of two had gained 113 pounds and lost all hope of ever being thin again . But a chance encounter at her doctor 's office and a library card helped Janis turn her life around and slim herself down permanently . <p> <p> " All of my life I lived in a small rural town with my family nearby . Moving was really devastating for me . At 39 , I felt the rug was being ripped out from under me . Leaving my family and friends left me feeling empty , and food helped fill the void . <p> To my surprise , I loved Florida , but I could n't stop gaining weight . For the next three years , I tried diet after diet , but they never worked . I 'd deprive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gain back 20 . Finally , at over 200 pounds , I became so frustrated with dieting that I threw away my scale and the smaller-sized clothes I kept in my closet as an incentive to lose weight . I decided I was going to be fat for the rest of my life . THE LIBRARY PLAN <p> It was n't until a year later , when a case of food poisoning sent me to the doctor , that I found hope . The doctor 's receptionist told me her story about how she lost weight thanks to reading up on healthy eating , and it inspired me to try to lose weight one last time . But this time I approached things differently . I knew from past experience that starving myself to lose weight was n't the answer . There had to be a better way , and I was going to find it  --  at the library . <p> I checked out some books and took notes on everything from low-fat recipes that sounded tasty to the proper way of doing a sit-up . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Diets that relied on eating specific food combinations sounded silly . Exercise regimes that revolved around activities I did n't like , such as aerobics and jogging , were out of the question , because if I did n't enjoy an exercise , I knew I would n't do it . <p> The more I learned , the more I wanted to know . I returned the books and checked out others . Diet books , exercise books , nutrition books , cookbooks with low-fat recipes . Each book made me feel more confident . For the first time in my life I understood my problem and felt like I had the information to manage it . <p> After a month of research , I decided to put what I 'd learned into practice . I did n't start a diet  --  I started a new way of eating that was n't about counting calories or starving . Instead it was about eating plenty of nutritious , low-fat food and then moving my body . I changed the way I cooked my favorite foods  --  a package of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half stick of butter and a hefty shake of salt but a modest dose of Molly McButter . I learned to snack on raw vegetables and pretzels instead of mixed nuts and cheese . <p> My husband , Danny , supported me through it all . He willingly tried new foods ( for us ) like asparagus , broccoli and cauliflower and spices like paprika , dill and thyme . He did n't complain when nonfat cheese and yogurt replaced the high-fat versions that had been in the refrigerator , and he even brought home some low-fat recipes . Of course there were a few flops  --  we ended up throwing out one fish dish  --  but on the whole we found a lot of wonderful new recipes . FLORIDA WORKOUTS <p> But eating right was only half the story , and the easy half at that . Although I dreaded going out into the Florida heat , I knew from everything I 'd read that exercise was key to keeping the pounds off . <p> So I started walking because it was an exercise I was likely to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was coolest and there were n't a lot of people around . At first it was terrible . After a block or two in the Florida heat , I 'd be red faced and panting . <p> I was embarrassed and imagined that everyone who saw me was thinking , ' She 's so big , why does she even bother ? ' Walking was n't as bad when Danny came with me . Although he walked faster than I did , I felt more comfortable and confident with him . It was n't just his kind words and praise that motivated me , but also his actions . If it rained , he 'd get out an umbrella or suggest we walk at the mall . He really kept me going . His support even showed in the presents he gave me . For my forty-fifth birthday , he bought us both bikes . I almost cried . I was 45 years old and I 'd never owned a new bike ! <p> Now when I ride my bike or play any of the sports I could n't before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much energy . I 'm out swimming , playing tennis , hiking and taking long walks every chance I get . Of course , one thing has changed . Now when Danny and I go walking , he 's the one who says , ' I ca n't keep up . ' " <p> <p> BODY MAKEOVERS presents the best weight-loss and shape-up success stories of Prevention readers .

" That 's what Janis Blevins imagined everyone was thinking when she lumbered by on her daily walks . <p> Negative self-talk like Janis ' is a common barrier to exercise , says Myles Faith , PhD , postdoctoral research fellow at the obesity research center at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City . Dr. Faith says one way to fight negativism is to focus instead on your strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercise . With every step you take tell yourself , " this is making me stronger , " or " this is for my health . " <p> * Remember your goals . Remind yourself why you 're doing this in the first place . <p> * Substitute coping statements , such as " I can keep doing this , " for your negative thoughts . Recognize your discomfort but tell yourself , " I can stand this . " <p> DEAR SPOUSE : HELP ! <p> Janis Blevins says she could n't have achieved her goal without the encouragement of her husband , Danny . But how do you ask for that support ? Ross Andersen , PhD , associate director of exercise science at Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center , Baltimore , says the best approach is a straightforward one . <p> " Explain to your family what you will be doing and that this is important to you , " he says . " Make it clear that this means there might not be Oreos in the house or you might not be at home all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the same token , family members need to support dieters not just with their words , but through their actions , as well . <p> * Make exercise a family affair . Show dieters you want them to succeed by walking or bike riding with them . <p> * Help prepare nutritious meals and keep tempting high-fat foods out of the house . <p> * Remember there will be setbacks . Do n't condemn dieters when they give in to an indulgence . Instead , gently remind them of their goals and encourage them to resume the diet . <p>
