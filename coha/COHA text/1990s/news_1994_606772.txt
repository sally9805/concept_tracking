<p> The intrigue and skulduggery surrounding the Sept. 28 assassination of a top ruling party official read like a page-turner murder mystery whose final chapter has yet to be written . <p> There are life-and-death power struggles , possible connections to international drug traffickers , vested financial interests vying for billions of dollars in ill-gotten wealth , and a crusading law enforcement official who has vowed to uncover the truth at all cost . <p> Government officials and diplomats say they are treating the killing of Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) Secretary General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu as a warning from those who have profited illicitly from 65 unbroken years of PRI rule in Mexico . They are serving notice , a diplomat said , to would-be reformers and anti-corruption crusaders that it is time to back off . <p> Officials say there clearly was a conspiracy  --  involving at least 15 people , 12 of whom have been jailed and formally charged  --  in Ruiz Massieu 's assassination . Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu , the slain PRI leader 's brother , signaled this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership ranks . He said he is willing to name names and present proof publicly , if necessary , to see that justice is done . <p> What is unfolding is a struggle for the very soul of Mexico , diplomats say , and it could not be occurring at a worse time for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . <p> Salinas , whose six-year term expires Dec. 1 , is campaigning internationally to become head of the new World Trade Organization . His campaign , endorsed a week ago by President Clinton , draws heavily on the image Salinas cultivated for Mexico over the last six years as a newly stable and vibrant democracy . <p> But the Ruiz Massieu killing  --  combined with the still shadowy March 23 assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , a peasant rebellion in southern Mexico and the kidnappings of several prominent businessmen  --  hardly helped advance the image . <p> Both Salinas and his elected successor , Ernesto Zedillo , rose to power through use of the PRI 's web of labor unions , peasant organizations and big-business campaign financiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged to root out its perpetrators . <p> In the process , they have angered many powerful individuals who amassed huge personal fortunes by using the same national party network to extort payoffs , win major government contracts and open Mexican territory to some of the world 's biggest drug cartels , according to former government officials and diplomats . <p> The money at stake amounts to tens of billions of dollars annually , one U.S. official said . Because Mexico has no real system of checks and balances on abuse of power , the PRI has been able to operate more like a huge national corporation than as a political party , the official contended . <p> The threat of reform within the party and the possibility that the PRI may be cut loose from the state apparatus it has controlled since 1929 are " tantamount to a declaration of war , " a diplomat said . <p> PRI members in influential positions have been named in major investigations of gunrunning , drug trafficking and money laundering . Shortly after the inauguration of Salinas in 1988 , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joaquin Hernandez Galicia , who as leader of one of the largest PRI-controlled labor unions had delivered hundreds of thousands of votes and bankrolled presidential campaigns over two decades . In a raid on his house , police found more than 200 Uzi automatic rifles and at least 25,000 rounds of ammunition . <p> Hernandez 's Mexican Petroleum Workers ' Union  --  the largest division of the PRI 's labor sector , the Confederation of Mexican Workers  --  also has been under investigation by the DEA and Mexican attorney general 's office for allegedly facilitating the import of narcotics for the Tamaulipas-based Gulf of Mexico drug cartel . <p> Last August and September , Deputy Attorney General Ruiz Massieu ordered federal police to shut down the cartel and arrest its leaders , including Juan Garcia Abrego , who remains at large . <p> Police arrested Garcia Abrego 's lieutenant , Raul Valladares del Angel , and the cartel 's reputed chief of money-laundering operations , Carlos Resendez , who also allegedly was responsible for handling payments to government , PRI and law-enforcement officials involved in protecting the cartel 's operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader Jose Ruiz Massieu was gunned down in broad daylight on a Mexico City street by a Tamaulipas resident , who first identified himself as " Joel Resendez " but was later identified as Daniel Aguilar Trevino . <p> Eduardo Valle , who until March was special assistant to the attorney general , said Aguilar 's use of the pseudonym Resendez was a clear message . " They were telling Mario Ruiz Massieu to back off , " he explained . <p> Valle contends that the younger brother of cartel leader Carlos Resendez was an aide to the late PRI candidate Colosio and was sent by Garcia Abrego to infiltrate the campaign . Valle , who now lives outside Washington in what he calls " self-exile , " asserts that the Gulf Cartel ordered Colosio 's assassination . <p> The government says no evidence exists to substantiate Valle 's claims . <p> Police now are conducting a nationwide search for a PRI federal congressman from Tamaulipas , Manuel Munoz Rocha , who according to confessions by Aguilar and other alleged accomplices , was the mastermind of the Ruiz Massieu assassination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munoz Rocha for " crimes against public welfare " after police raided his home and allegedly found 200 grams of cocaine and 12 cases of ammunition . <p> Earlier in the week  --  while Salinas was in Indonesia promoting his candidacy for the World Trade Organization  --  an unusual public feud broke out between Mario Ruiz Massieu and the president of the PRI , Ignacio Pichardo Pegaza . Ruiz Massieu accused Pichardo of deliberately obstructing his investigation into his brother 's assassination . <p> The deputy attorney general accused Pichardo and the party 's new secretary general , Maria de los Angeles Moreno , of making " crude declarations " regarding the government 's investigation of the assassination and claimed that the party 's leadership was " absolutely opposed " to inquiries regarding a possible broader conspiracy within the PRI . <p> " It was preferable to portray the assassination as an act of gangsters , as Pichardo Pegaza called it , and reduce the matter to that level , " Mario Ruiz Massieu said in a television interview Monday . " They were more concerned with trying to defend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . " <p> Pichardo Pegaza spearheaded the PRI campaign of President-elect Zedillo , who won a landslide victory in the Aug. 21 presidential elections . Political observers said Mario Ruiz Massieu is working feverishly to investigate and prosecute those involved in his brother 's assassination before Zedillo 's Dec. 1 inauguration , in part because the president-elect is expected to shake up the attorney general 's office and fire Ruiz Massieu . <p> Mexico City newspapers reported that the attorney general 's office is investigating whether the conspiracy was directly linked to the directorship of the National Peasants ' Union , one of the three main organizational branches of the PRI . <p> A senior PRI official connected to the Peasants ' Union acknowledged in an interview that recent reforms within the organization had angered many PRI party bosses at the local and state levels who felt their power bases were being threatened . <p> " The resisters are the old party leaders  --  people who came into power 20 years ago . We tried to tell them we were n't threatening their power bases , but it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the official said . The official added that the reforms were ordered by Jose Ruiz Massieu with " 100 percent support " from Salinas and Zedillo . <p> The deputy attorney general said he is investigating possible connections between the conspirators in the Ruiz Massieu assassination and the leadership of the Peasants ' Union , whose leader , Hugo Andres Araujo , also served as a PRI congressman from Tamaulipas . <p> The deputy attorney general argued in interviews this week that the PRI leadership was deliberately slow in taking action to strip Munoz Rocha of his congressional immunity , which hindered arrest immediately after he was charged . <p> PRI President Pichardo disputed the deputy attorney general 's allegations and demanded Tuesday that he provide proof to back up his claims . After the deputy attorney general said he would be happy to provide the proof , President Salinas intervened and ordered both to halt their public bickering . <p> Under an accord signed Wednesday , the PRI agreed to cooperate fully with Ruiz Massieu , while he agreed not to air his grievances through the media .
