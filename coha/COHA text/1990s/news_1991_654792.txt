<p> IBRAHIM ISKANDEROV 's office as the vice president of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences is decorated in the style of a successful Communist official . Brocade drapes hang in the picture windows . A long dark hardwood conference table stands to one side . A dozen telephones crowd alongside his broad desk . <p> Above the desk , an oil portrait of Vladimir Lenin fills an entire wall . The former head of the state planning agency and ex-deputy premier of Uzbekistan peppers his conversation with references to Karl Marx 's " Das Kapital . " <p> But Mr. Iskanderov uses Marxism to make an argument no Uzbek Communist would even have whispered to his closest friends a few years ago . Uzbekistan suffers from a " colonial relationship " with the Soviet Union , he says . According to Marx 's labor theory of value , he carefully explains , Uzbek cotton is sold for a mere fifth of its worth . <p> " We have remained a source of raw materials , " Iskanderov says . " Today 90 percent of our cotton is exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " New type of party emerges Iskanderov is no dissident . He faithfully reflects the views of Islam Karimov , who became Uzbekistan 's party boss in June 1989 and then republican president in March 1990 . The former economic planner represents a new brand of Communist in this stronghold of party power - the " national Communist . " <p> Here and in other parts of the Soviet Union , Communists are finding that to survive they must shed the rhetoric of " proletarian internationalism " and embrace the cause of nationalism . In the Baltic republics , not unlike in Eastern Europe , the national Communists have formally broken from the Soviet Communist Party , even adopting a new identity as social democrats . Others , such as Uzbekistan 's Mr. Karimov or the Ukraine 's Leonid Kravchuk , have more cautiously endorsed the ideas of nationalist movements while avoiding an open split with Moscow . Anticommunists first The nationalist cause was first championed in Uzbekistan by Birlik ( " Unity " ) , an anticommunist movement for democratization founded in November 1988 . Birlik advocated a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending military service outside the republic , and solving severe ecological problems . But it hit hardest by exposing the systematic distortion of the Uzbek economy through the cotton monoculture . <p> Until recently , about 90 percent of Uzbek farmland was devoted to cotton cultivation . Under the Soviet central planning system , cheap raw cotton is shipped to mills in other republics , forcing Uzbekistan to buy clothing from outside at greater cost . <p> " They were telling us that the motherland should be self-sufficient in cotton , " recalls Academician Tashmukhammedov , the director of the Institute of Plant Physiology and a Birlik leader . " But we lost bread and meat independence . " <p> With a touch of bitterness , Birlik leaders say Karimov has snatched many of their ideas . Karimov has opened the door to greater private use of land , on a lease basis . Most important , he has reduced cotton cultivation by about 20 percent in the last two years and got Moscow to pay a higher price for it . And among republican leaders , Karimov has emerged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and internal affairs , within a Soviet federation . <p> Yet Karimov 's role divides the ranks of the democratic and nationalist movement . Some democrats say he is a Communist wolf in nationalist clothing , one who suppresses the democratic movement to retain a Communist monopoly of power . <p> " Karimov is a Stalinist , " the bearded Birlik co-chairman Abdur Makat Pulatov says angrily , replying in part to the less harsh views of his colleagues in the poster-festooned Birlik headquarters . " He is an advocate of the command-administered system , against privatization , for the kolkhoz ( collective farms ) . He wants the press to be controlled . " <p> Mr. Tashmukhammedov sees Karimov more positively . " Karimov is like ( Soviet leader Mikhail ) Gorbachev : One can push him left . But we ca n't push the ( party ) apparatus left . They are our main target . " And is Karimov truly a nationalist ? " He would like to secede , without democratization , " answers Tashmukhammedov . <p> " He is merely playing with the national feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new treaty of union is ready , " he 'll be the first to sign it . " <p> Wherever the truth may lie , there is no denying that Karimov 's national communism has been successful in gaining popular support , including from the Uzbek intelligentsia . <p> " Today ( Karimov ) would even win direct elections , " says Timour Valyev , a cybernetics professor and former Birlik leader . He formally left the movement last fall when he became a member of Karimov 's Presidential Council . <p> Karimov is an " honest person , " says Mr. Valyev . " He is trying , using his own ways , to improve living conditions for the people of Uzbekistan . He may be mistaken on certain points but he is capable of learning and drawing lessons . " In part , he says , Karimov is limited by the power of the party and state bureaucracy , particularly on the distribution of land for private farming . <p> Real reforms blocked ? <p> The party bosses block real agricultural reform , agrees agronomist Mirza-Ali Muhammedjanov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was ousted for his opposition to the cotton monoculture . Agricultural land should be given to peasants on a permanent lease with the right to pass it on to their children , he says . At least 80 percent of state and collective farms are inefficient and should be disbanded , he explains . Collectivization is closely tied to the cotton monoculture and the severe agricultural crisis , he concludes . Full privatization is difficult in Uzbekistan because of the high ratio of population to land , he argues . <p> The Karimov leadership offers a moderate version of this view . The party has proposed long-term leasing of land but without inheritance . It wants to retain the collective farms that are its power base in the rural areas where about 80 percent of the Uzbek population lives . And while Karimov talks sharply about the need to gain control of Uzbek destiny , he steers far clear of any talk of independence . <p> " We gave it a thought , " says Iskanderov . " But the economic connections with other republics are so deep-rooted that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Iskanderov want to reform the distortions that sprang from the myth that the Soviet economy is an integrated structure in which each republic has its specializations . <p> " In this republic , we should have been developing light industry and cotton mills , " explains Iskanderov . " Instead they built jumbo factories with 37,000 workers , and built them in cities while there was no industrial development in rural areas . " <p> Though independence is rejected , there are nascent moves to form an economic bloc of the four Central Asian republics and Kazakhstan , all of which share similar complaints of colonial exploitation by the center . Iskanderov chairs a study group that is developing plans for such a grouping . <p> Muhammedjanov , who proudly shows visitors his medal for 50 years of Communist Party membership , finds Karimov a refreshing change from the earlier leaders . " He can resist Moscow . He has his own opinion . Maybe he overplays it sometimes . Many say he has a dictatorial nature
