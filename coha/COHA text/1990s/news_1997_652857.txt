<p> WHEN Henry Kravis and Carolyne Roehm separated in 1993 , her mother said , " Now you 'll know who your friends are . " <p> Ms. Roehm winces at the memory . " At the time , I asked , ' Do I want to know that much ? ' " <p> Sitting in the living room of her Sutton Place apartment last week , Ms. Roehm said , " There are people I never heard from again , but the people who have remained my friends are wonderful . " <p> A group of them declared themselves last week by throwing a publication party at the Union League Club for Ms. Roehm 's first book , " A Passion for Flowers " ( HarperCollins , $45 ) . The list read like a gossip column from the glory days of the 1980 's , featuring Gayfryd Steinberg , Anne Bass and Blaine Trump . <p> But the appearance of one guest in particular moved Ms. Roehm : Kimberly Kravis , her former stepdaughter . " I had n't seen her or Robbie , her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you should let the dust settle with everything in life . They 're great kids . " <p> In the court of New York social crimes , Ms. Roehm committed an unthinkable offense : she let a billionaire husband get away . As a result , she lost her design business ( which he financed ) , her cachet on the charity circuit and her must-have status at A-list parties . For all the women who secretly hated her for her money and because at 5 feet 10 inches she weighed 114 pounds , it became open season . Her dress designs were good , sure , but not as good as those of her mentor , Oscar de la Renta , who gave her her start . <p> In 1991 , after her company folded , a casualty of both the recession and the unexpected death of her stepson Harrison , she regrouped and started a catalogue business . Yes , that was promising  --  in its first year it exceeded projected sales of $500,000 and grossed $3 million  --  but truly , catalogues are so democratic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Roehm always insisted on only the best materials , and that just was n't practical . So , once the husband went , there went the catalogue . Next . <p> Ms. Roehm , 46 , knows all this , of course . Nestled in her overstuffed couch , barricaded by brocade and taffeta pillows , she talked about her book on flowers and her meaning was not lost . " I do n't want to sound hokey , " she said , " but if you see a perennial garden out of season , you think it will never come back and it does . Flowers are forever . Yes , they die , but another one always sprouts . " She blushed . " I 'm not gifted enough to explain this . " <p> For a visual person , as she repeatedly calls herself , it 's not a bad explanation . The thing about Carolyne Roehm that her detractors underestimate is a very important one : she is smart enough to know what she does n't know , and she never stops trying to learn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that did her in , both in her career and in her marriage . She would regularly rise at 6 A.M. , exercise , take piano lessons , study French , work at the office 10 to 12 hours a day , organize enormous black-tie benefits and keep up not only the Park Avenue duplex and the Connecticut house , but also two homes in Southampton , a villa in the Dominican Republic , a ski house and a ranch in Colorado . Do n't cry for me , Argentina ? Try it first and see how long it would take to fall over . <p> " One hates a marriage to fail , " Ms. Roehm said carefully . " It 's so painful . But in the end it probably saved my life . Why was I so driven ? You could speak to an analyst , I guess , who would say , ' She was so insecure she just had to prove herself in everything . ' " She sighed , and seemed relieved that her two maids appeared to serve tea  --  on silver trays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pour , all limbs . She was wearing brown stretch pants that betrayed not a trace of body fat , though she claims to have gained 14 pounds since her divorce . " I know I was a cadaver , " she said . " Now , I 'll ride horses , play tennis and ski , but I do n't want to exercise . " <p> Her long arms shine with moisturizer , her dark brown hair shines with conditioner and her skin is unlined peaches and cream . Sipping tea , with her pointy chin and her upturned nose , she seemed familiar somehow . If Mary Poppins had married a mogul in New York in the 1980 's , she would look like Carolyne Roehm . <p> " I 'd wanted to be a fashion designer all my life and I wanted to be successful at it , " she said . " When I met Henry in 1980 , there had n't been the big deals . Life was different . " The couple married in 1985 . " When I started my business I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls apart ? ' " She smiled wryly . " It was the right question . <p> " But women responded to my clothes . Henry started doing huge deals . I actually learned from him about doing work for charity , that giving your time to raise money is a responsibility when you 're very lucky . So I plunged into that . I 'm not the type that can let go . The couple of times I did n't follow through 100 percent I thought less of myself . I was a strung-out wreck . I admit it  --  I got caught up in the 80 's and lost track of what was important in my life . I was on that fast track to nowhere . " <p> But did she have to lose her business in the process ? She sighed . " One gets married with the idea it will last forever , " she said . " These are the risks you take in life . And you know what ? I was a big girl . Henry gave me an opportunity to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In addition to publishing " A Passion for Flowers , " Ms. Roehm is once again getting into the catalogue business , selling home accessories under the name Home by Carolyne Roehm . This time , though , she owns the business herself and she 's starting out small , with only 20 items . " I do n't want to be a dog wagged by its tail , " she said . " I want to grow this steadily . Yes , I love extravagant things but I want to give people value . All the merchandise is from Portugal  --  and it 's in stock . There 's something about the European artisan that intrigues me . " <p> Maybe so , though this room does n't show it . Oil portraits by Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun , a friend and confidante of Marie Antoinette , hang everywhere and there are no fewer than five arrangements of roses . There are also gold candelabra , a marble bust mounted on a pedestal , a fireplace topped by a grand scrolled mirror and yards of art books . But for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes from filling when she talks about men ( " I hope and pray I will be madly in love and want to be with someone all the time , but I do n't know if that necessarily means marriage " ) and it does n't stop her eyes from brimming when she recalls getting pregnant in vitro during her marriage and losing the baby . <p> " I 'm thinking about adopting kids now , " she said . " Strangely enough , while I might have missed my chance to do it , I do n't think I would have been a very good mother . With the space I 've had these last few years , I think now I would be O.K. " <p> Ca n't she just hear people say : " And why not ? You certainly can afford it . " She nodded . " I think when people say nasty things it 's not about you , it 's about them . I am finally getting better about that . Not everyone is going to like me , not everyone is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . I make mistakes , like we all do . The people who work for me care for me . They are my extended family . " <p> Her own family shrank with her father 's death two years ago . Ms. Roehm was the only child of two educators , born in Kirksville , Mo. , who had to suffer the indignity of a father who was her junior high school principal . Her mother , now retired , was a teacher and speech pathologist . Growing up in Missouri , Ms. Roehm , who was named Carolyne Jane Smith at birth and went by the name Janie , used to play dress-up with castoff gowns sent by relatives and dream of becoming a designer . The very first thing she ever bought herself was a rhinestone tiara  --  from the Sears , Roebuck catalogue . <p> After graduating from Washington University in St. Louis , she moved to New York and worked for Kellwood , a company that manufactured sportswear for , appropriately enough , Sears . She then became , after much persistence , Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection . She took a yearlong intermission in 1978 to move to Darmstadt , Germany , and marry Axel Roehm , the heir to a chemical fortune , a union she has termed " disastrous . " <p> When her own design business closed and her divorce from Mr. Kravis was finalized in 1994 , she took off for Oxford University to study Shakespearean tragedy . " I used to say to Henry , ' How much money does one have to have in life before my fantasy of taking a year off and studying all the things I was too stupid to study in college would come true ? Would n't it be fun ? ' " She smiled , though it was half grimace . " I do n't think he thought it was so much fun . " At Worcester College , she lived in a dorm room and loved it , before moving on to Paris and an apprenticeship with Henri Moulie , the grandmaster of flower arranging . <p> " Flowers are really what I love the most , in terms of things , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , as does a good book or a piece of music . Nothing gives me greater pleasure . " <p> After four months in Paris , she returned to Weatherstone , the Connecticut house , " back home to my garden , " she said . " I 'm lucky that a lot of people I really like are near my home in Connecticut and that everything I love is there  --  my flowers , vegetables , six dogs , cats , horses . I just got two goats . There 's a real spirit there . I laugh there , I cry there , I spend time alone there comfortably . I do n't think I 'm the flaky type in terms of spirituality , but home is my relationship with my animals and garden and house . All my senses are more finely tuned there . If I see my animals do something charming or find a huge dahlia that 's a luscious red color , I physically feel that surge in my heart , like it 's getting bigger . I have that there , not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner , indulges her love for funny movies and white truffles and exults in the fact that she has n't given one party in this apartment since last Christmas . Indeed , the only sounds that have punctuated the afternoon are the constant ringing of the phone and the fax in the next room . The sense of quiet anticipation , of new beginnings , is everywhere . What else could she want ? <p> Again , her tireless radar for her own limitations goes up . " In my next life , I want to be funny , " she said seriously . " Like Erma Bombeck . When other people are funny , I laugh , but I 'd love to do it myself . " She leaned back and sighed . " If nothing else , on my tombstone it will say : ' She was a very hard worker . She might not have been effective but , boy , she worked hard . ' "
