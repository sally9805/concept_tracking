The image that has stuck most stubbornly to Dan Quayle from the 1988 campaign is that of a deer caught in the headlights : a helpless thing frozen in the path of destruction . In Houston , however , Quayle labored  --  with some success  --  to transform himself into a snarling attack dog , on the model of such G.O.P. vice-presidential nominees as Bob Dole and Spiro Agnew . Before the largest prime-time TV audience he has addressed , Quayle abandoned his attempted oratorical gravitas and delivered a withering attack on what he has called the " liberal cultural elite , " which he has targeted to help distract attention from the economy . Liberals " look down on our beliefs , " Quayle growled . Bill Clinton " ca n't fight for the traditional family because his supporters in Hollywood and the media elite wo n't let him . " <P> That pitch roused the crowd in Houston , but polls show most Republicans still consider Quayle unqualified . And a slew of other presidential aspirants are also positioning themselves to run in 1996 . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Buchanan , Housing Secretary Jack Kemp , Massachusetts Governor William Weld and William Bennett , former commander of the war on drugs . And Texas Senator Phil Gramm , another 1996 hopeful , hurt himself with a keynote address that delegates judged too long and snoozy . Then again , that was the rap on the 1988 keynote speech of the Democrat who now leads George Bush in the polls .
