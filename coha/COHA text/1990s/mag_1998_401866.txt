// Chris pushed the pitcher of orange juice to his brother . " Man , " he said , " am I glad it 's Friday . Tomorrow I 'm not getting up till 9:59 . " " That 's a funny time , " Jason said . " That 's one minute before Day of Horror ' starts on Channel 5 . It 's back-toback monster movies until four o'clock , beginning with Bog Beetle . I 'm going to watch them all . " " Me , too , " said Jason . " Oh , no you 're not , " said their mom , coming into the kitchen . " And you 're not either , Chris , " she said . " I 've got to work the lunch shift tomorrow , which means I 'll need you to take care of Jason . And you may not park him in front of the television for six hours of junk movies . " " You heard Mom , " Jason whispered . " No parking me . " It was lunchtime before Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . " I ca n't watch the movies either , " Tim said , shaking his head . " Dad said I 've got to rake the yard , and it 's ankle-deep in leaves . It 'll take hours . " " I've. got to work , too , " Rosa said . " It 's my turn to do the laundry . " " And I 've got to weed our garden , " Annie said . " Some Saturday . " Chris peered into the bottom of his lunch bag and studied the choices . " Well , " he said , pulling out an apple , " I 'd rather do any of the stuff you 've got to do than spend Saturday entertaining Jason . He 's going to want me to play with him and his toy trucks all day . Too bad we ca n't trade . " Chris brought the apple to his mouth and then stopped before taking a bite . " Hey , " he said . " Why not ? Trade jobs , I mean . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves at Tim 's house , and Tim would weed the garden at Annie 's . Rosa would babysit Jason , and Chris would do the laundry for Rosa . And , thought Chris , I might even get to see part of Bog Beetle while doing the wash . Chris mentioned the arrangement to his mom while they were eating dinner . She already knew about it . " Rosa called , " she said . " I think the trade is a fine idea . " Chris 's mom was smiling , but Chris thought it was a strange smile-sort of like a smile with laughter hovering underneath . Chris rang the doorbell of Rosa 's apartment at 9:45 the next morning , and Rosa opened the door while the chime was still echoing . " I 've got everything ready for you . " She waved her hand toward two large baskets of clothes just inside the door and held out a piece of paper . " Here are the instructions , and here , " she said , pulling an envelope from a jeans pocket , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand at first . " What do I need money for ? " " The machines , of course , " Rosa said . Then she laughed . " Have n't you ever been in a laundromat ? " Rosa put one heaping laundry basket into Chris 's hands and then loaded the other one on top . " The laundry on Main Street is only two blocks away . " Tim 's house was in the block between Rosa 's apartment and the laundry . Annie was in the front yard , raking . She had already gathered a huge mound of leaves , but most of the yard was still covered . " Hey , " she called to Chris , wiping her forehead with the sleeve of her sweatshirt . " I think I should have stuck with weeding . " Chris looked across the jumble of dirty clothes he was carrying . Even leaves would be better . " Want to trade ? " he asked . " I 've got to take this stuff to the laundromat and then sit with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazines there . " Annie took the laundry . " Do n't forget the backyard , " she said . " And thanks . Hey , if nobody 's watching something else , maybe I can even see part of Bog Beetle . " " Hey , wait a minute , " Chris said , but Annie , walking rapidly toward Main Street , ignored him . A television in the laundromat ? Chris thought . Criminy . Rosa and Jason were the next people Chris saw . They were half a block away , walking along Main with another girl and a little kid . A canvas bag swung from Rosa 's shoulder . " Rosa ! Jason ! " Chris called , dropping the rake and running to catch up with them . " Where are you going ? " he asked . " To the zoo , " Jason said . " For a picnic there , " Rosa said , " with my sister Maria and my brother Joe . Do n't worry . I checked with your mom about it yesterday . " So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris thought . My own mother . Criminy . Chris was still raking at noon , when Tim came home . " Am I glad to see you , " Chris said . " You 've got a big yard . " // " Yeah , " Tim said , " if you switched with Annie , you made a bad choice . I bet you 've got another hour of work to do , at least . " " Are n't you going to help me ? " Chris asked . " Ca n't , " Tim said . " Annie 's mom was so pleased with the weeding job I did she gave me money for the Saturday afternoon movie . I 've just got time to get a sandwich before I go . I 'll bring one out to you , too . " Tim started for the house and then turned back . " You know , Chris , " he said , " I 'm glad this work trade was your idea . Otherwise I 'd feel guilty . " Criminy , Chris thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced into his own house just before two o'clock , barely in time to catch the last of the " Day of Horror " movies . He turned to Channel 5 and found a ball game in progress . Surely the station would n't cancel something like " Day of Horror " ! Surely it would , Chris thought . Just as surely as everything else had gone wrong . Chris 's mom and Rosa and Jason arrived home at the same time . Chris heard their excited voices on the walk and went to the door . " Chris , " Jason yelled , " I saw an elephant carry a log from one yard to another , and the sea lion keeper wanted a helper for his feeding demonstration and he picked me , and .... " " Do n't screech , " Chris said . " You 're hurting my ears . " " Did you have a nice day , dear ? " his mother asked . Chris nodded stiffly . He was n't about to tell the truth . Not when that laugh was lurking behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he answered . " My day was great , " Rosa said . " I 'll trade you laundry for Jason anytime . " " Thanks anyway , " Chris said . " I 'll take care of Jason myself . " He did n't add that he 'd had most of the day to figure out that he could combine Jason-sitting with a morning at the community center . // Chris was lying in bed that night , reading , when Jason padded into his room . " I 've been thinking , Chris , " Jason said . " Rosa was a pretty good babysitter . " Chris scowled at Jason . " Yeah ? " " Yeah , " Jason said . " So good that I think maybe it 's going to take me a while to figure out which one of you I want to take care of me next Saturday . " Jason smiled at Chris , a smile just like their mother 's , a smile that hid laughter . He hoisted himself onto the foot of Chris 's bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris , while I think about it . " Chris threw a pillow at him . " Yeah , " Chris said . " And maybe after that you 'd like to start learning how to throw a football . " Jason did n't just smile then . He laughed . // <p>
