Faster and faster they go , harder and harder they push , but like hamsters on a wheel , America 's working families are stuck at the bottom . Clobbered on two fronts , they must work twice as hard to stay even . On the income side , wages have gone down while taxes have risen . On the expenditure side , living costs have soared . Homes , health insurance , college education  --  the basic ingredients of the American Dream  --  are increasingly out of reach . <P> The crunch began with a dramatic falloff in earnings , particularly for blue- collar males . Between 1955 and 1973 , the median wage of men leaped from $15,056 to $24,621 . Then , quite suddenly , it started to drop . By 1987 the male wage , adjusted for inflation , was back down to $19,859 , a 19% decline . To shore up family income , wives have flooded into the labor market , but their earning power is low . In 1988 the average family income was only 6% higher than in 1973 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many households , one well-paid smokestack job with health insurance has been replaced by two service jobs without benefits . Burger King does n't provide as well as Bethlehem Steel . <P> Higher taxes have tightened the pinch . The acclaimed Reagan tax cuts of 1986 , which reduced marginal income taxes , merely shifted the burden to Social Security taxes , which fall heavily on low- and middle-income families . These payroll taxes were jacked up 24% during the 1980s . The true marginal tax rate is now higher for a couple making $14,000 a year than it is for a couple making $326,000 a year ! <P> It does n't help that over the past 25 years the cost of housing has jumped 56% and college tuitions have rocketed 87.9% in real dollars . Joseph Minarik , executive director of the congressional Joint Economic Committee estimates that the typical 30-year-old man buying a median-priced home in 1973 incurred carrying costs equal to 21% of his income . By 1987 this had risen to 40% . For the first time since World War II , home ownership among young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Chicago area : " You either buy a home , both of you work and your kids suffer , or one of you works and you live in a rental . Paying rent feels like digging a hole and crawling right in . " <P> This squeeze on families bodes ill for children . Twelve million youngsters have no medical coverage ; 5 million teeter on the edge of homelessness . Because of poor prenatal care , a baby born in the shadow of the White House is now more likely to die in the first year of life than a baby born in Costa Rica . <P> But perhaps the resource in shortest supply to families is time together . The amount of " total contact time " between parents and children has dropped 40% over the past 25 years , says the Family Research Council in Washington . This is not good news . Researchers have uncovered ominous links between absentee parents and behavioral problems among children . A 1989 survey of 5,000 eighth-grade students in Southern California found , for instance , that latchkey children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children supervised by adults after school .
