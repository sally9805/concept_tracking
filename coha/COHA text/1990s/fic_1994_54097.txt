Exiled from yourself , you fuse with everything you meet . You imitate whatever comes close . You become whatever touches you . <p>  --  Luce Irigaray , This Sex Which Is Not One At night I sleep without movement in the suburbs of a Phoenix desert , having dreams of hot plants in the Andes , dreams filled with parents as they talk to me through moldy Peruvian phone lines from Lima . I dream of their typed letters on fine onion skin paper , filed , unopened because I do n't want to hear or read about them telling me they know God . When it 's closer to morning and the Arizona desert is already getting hot , I dream of Peruvian boot prints in short grass , and of wet apples covered in chocolate that reflect the Aymara faces and the Aymara bodies who stand in weeds before the picking season begins . And if I 've run too far the day before , trying to lean out , I sometimes dream of white women 's bodies that do n't look like bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her white skin and white clothes , will occasionally call from a Peruvian village she is visiting to tell me none of these things are in the South America she knows . <p> " It 's just windy , " she says . " It makes people shoot guns . " <p> " I keep dreaming of chocolate-covered apples . I dream of machines , " I say . <p> " We live here . Your father and I should know . Chocolate and industry are American things . " <p> My mother calls me Terry and so do all her relatives , but I tell them it 's Teresa now . <p> " I 'm taking Spanish classes , " I tell my parents , long distance to Peru . " Hola , " I say for thirty dollars . I imagine my mother , dressed in white , sits on velvet chairs when we talk , that her voice echoes over polished marble floors . <p> " You 're always Terry , no matter what , " my mother says . <p> Sometimes I try to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in downtown Phoenix and buy tortillas cheap and hot from the tortilleria . I tell her I want to sell on street corners things I can make myself , with my fingers , with these calloused hands I use to lift weights and turn myself into something not quite human . I try not to tell my mother about my body , though . I try not to tell her that every day I lift so many barbells , do so many squats , my clothes fit fighter and men stare . I try not to tell her that I sit in my Spanish classes , trying to become foreign , wanting to pack a gun in a leather shoulder holster and walk stiffly past those barrio boys who take the same classes to laugh at the stilted language their parents speak . I try not to tell my mother that I want to walk past these same boys on the street , sneering and flexing myself at them until they faint . I do n't say anything to her about the scar I now have on my stomach from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell my parents about the barrio boy I look for every day , the barrio boy who held his gun so dose to my face when I was alone once , lifting heavy objects in an old weight room downtown close to where I work . <p> These things happen to women with muscles , I told myself then , and I keep saying it . So when my parents call , there is little I can say . <p> " My biceps are bigger , " I tell them , touching the scar on my stomach . Lately , muscles are the safest things I can tell my parents about , though I try to play it down . " I win things by flexing in public . I 'll send you a picture . " <p> " I hope you win money , " my mother says . " What 's the point if it does n't give you something to invest ? " <p> " It 'll keep her out of trouble , " my father says from another line . <p> " Have money so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And remember , white people do n't have to sell tortillas . " <p> Their financial advice is good , but the rest I try to ignore . I lie outside in the sun and inside in tanning booths until my white skin does n't look white . I eat tortillas before and after my heavier workouts , sitting in the sauna with a rag full of corn ones , chewing their dry , yellow textures . I sweat and think of yellow , the yellow of the barrio boy 's shirt , the way the color reflected off his gun , the way his teeth reflected everything . <p> I try to think of other things , like the way the color yellow looks so very deep and bright on the school bus I see every morning on my way to the bank , the bus full of children screaming , my bank boss 's children waving at me , making muscles at me through the thick windows that keep them all from jumping . When men in Jeeps and suits stare at me as we drive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and leave lipstick stains there to make them think twice . And as I drive into the basement of the bank , I stare back at the staring Latinos waiting for the morning grapefruit trucks . <p> " If you eat too many tortillas , soon you 'll be speaking nothing but Spanish , " my mother says during another long-distance conversation where bad connections require us to repeat everything we say . <p> " You should know about Spanish and tortillas , " I tell her . <p> " Spanish is good , " my father says . " I speak it . I eat tortillas . I was born in Juarez , you know . " Each time I call , my father tells the story of his father 's goats being buried by sand in the Sonoran desert . And I always laugh , long distance . <p> " Goats move too much , " my mother says . " Anyway , if your daughter came down here , I bet she 'd be shooting guns with the rest of them . I bet she 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maoists , " I say . I try to think of the word for " bourgeois " in Spanish , but nothing comes . My Spanish book does n't list it , and only has words like " dog , " " rain , " " apartment , " " rent . " Because I do n't think the Maoists would care much for my textbook Spanish , I tell my mother I could never visit them there in that place where people shoot and touch you too much , where people get too close to you with guns . <p> " Moving around is n't for me , " I tell my parents . " I have to stay where it 's warm and people understand what I 'm talking about . " <p> " Of course you can move . People are the same everywhere , " my mother says . My father hums on the other line , reading . <p> Sometimes , I ca n't move from the dusty chair I 'm sitting in right now , I want to tell them , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it is spring , I will watch desert tornados start to swirl . And when the dust in the sky turns yellow , like the yellow of his shirt so dose to my face , I do push-ups , I do sit-ups , I grab the bar in the kitchen doorway and pull until my head is too full and I almost want to kill like Maoists who shoot with quiet faces . <p> These parents of mine , they move and talk so much their motions upset the balance of things . At least that 's what Linda tells me , Linda , my trainer who once lifted herself , who says she is partly Navajo . Linda whose blond , muscular words make my body something other . And I do believe everything she says with her promises of bulk , cuts , and trophies . I do believe her as she gives me half-kisses between the strain of powerlifting sets , when I 'm pushing at weight until my skin is about to rip open . <p> This is what I try to think of when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all there is , " Linda says one day , using her pinky to pull slightly at the middle of the bench-press bar I 'm straining with in the middle of this weight room , a room I sometimes have dreams about at night as my large muscles twitch . When we first started here , when I had a body no one noticed , a body without veins , when Linda was still competing , and pushing her muscles at thin-haired judges , that was when the men who lift here used to ignore us . But now they stare as I strain , as my arms get bigger than theirs , as the muscle striations I pull at daily start to make me look like the metal I lift . <p> " You must have everything in alignment , " Linda says as we sit in her suburban home , as she massages me , and then , as she carefully folds my socks , placing them in a circle around me as I sit on the bed waiting for her to use the spiritual Navajo phrases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . <p> This is how Linda and I spend our nights , concentrating on the things that prepare us and our muscles for competition . We used to watch television when I first moved in . I was thin and unspectacular and never wanted to speak Spanish . Linda even used to kiss me , uncertain about what or who to love . Now she is more certain and kisses no one . Now I am told to sit on the bed and breathe in powerful words as she surrounds me with socks or with food , anything that is round , and thus , more spiritual . This almost Navajo woman turns out lights and makes me watch the ritual candle she holds , the blue flame of it , the way it moves back and forth when we breathe . It will , she says , make me forget the judges who grope and stare during competitions . When asphalt is melting outside on Phoenix streets , and Linda is saying her Navajo power words over me , the words that will make the judges know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my shoulders as if I was coming down from a sugar binge . <p> But this is not the time for a binge , Linda tells me . We have to be flexing and hard in the morning . We have to be completely without fat or sweat . <p> " We have to be mechanical , " she likes to say , and I like to hear it . Machine words make me feel like small , perfect molecules . Some nights she 'll even say I 'm " Steely " as she reads aloud from her Navajo books , trying to better learn the language she thinks her father spoke . <p> " We do not eat chocolate or fatty foods , " she says in English , and then in Navajo . She tries to translate everything she says into this Indian language , sometimes making me repeat after her as I strain my deltoids with dumbbells . She is always saying words I will never know or be able to pronounce . <p> But this is how a bodybuilder gains spirituality , and we are bodybuilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself flex in the bedroom mirror every night before we go to bed , celibate and tingling with the spent cells of muscle and incense and Navajo incantations . <p> " There are lots of jobs I have to do here , " I tell my parents when they ask me , again , to visit them in their Andean jungle , to tour the mountains of cocaine and poppy fields with them during the spring mists . " I lift weights , you know . My possessions are here . My car , my mascara , my Spanish class , my pets . " Of course , I have no pets , but mothers like them . Pets , like muscles , make them feel like their daughters will live through anything . <p> " You should n't have too many things . You 're still young , " they say , sounding almost like the Maoists they despise . They themselves are in denial , always saying " no " to things , " no " to materiality , " no " to new paint for their flaking walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no " to new shoes , they tell me , and put their Mercedes up on blocks , refusing to drive it anywhere out of a fear of God and things manmade . <p> " When you 're dead , objects wo n't matter , " my mother says . " We ca n't take our Mercedes with us . So why should we drive it now ? " <p> " You should buy something , paint the house , live in a condo , " I tell them , but they do n't listen . Their walls keep flaking . Their pool gets holes in the plaster as the water evaporates , unused . Their grass gets diseases . <p> " We 're just like monks , " they say . <p> " Monks are good , " Linda tells me later . " They know what they need and they know how to get it . " <p> These spare parental conversations from Peru make me dream at night of the Latin women my mother talks about , the ones I want to be like . Or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses . Of course , I do n't tell my parents any of this . And I do n't tell Linda . She always makes symbols out of things . If I dream of Oreos , she says it means there is a black woman named Carla whose muscles I will beat someday soon in competition . <p> " We are in training so everything is meaningful , " Linda would say . " The sand we run on swirls to make patterns that tell us things . The air particles tell us how close we are to becoming bigger . " <p> " Some people do n't want to be big , " I tell her . " Some people want to go unnoticed , be blank and invisible . " <p> " Only the holy can be invisible , " she says . <p> At the bank where I work , I speak in numbers . My boss looks hard at me when the loan season is slow , when men are n't borrowing money to finance a boat or a mistress or a desert pool . My boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those who thinks I am too big . <p> " That suit , it does n't look right on you , " he says . And it 's true . I look at myself in the building windows at lunch , my rippling reflection walking past mirrored glass , my well-defined calf muscles pushing at panty hose I will soon stop wearing . My legs are men 's legs . Drag queens who walk downtown , pretending their husbands have sent them out to shop , stop and ask me for advice as I eat enchiladas outside by noisy pigeons . I invite them to sit and have lunch , and this is how I end up in cafes eating lunch with those who are more beautiful than me , their transvestite faces more perfect than the gloss of magazine faces , their waists thin and ready for photographs . We talk about makeup and posture , and I nod at their questions as the outside heat saps me of what little moisture Linda has allowed me to have . When these men walk with me back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once , I sent my now Peruvian parents a picture , me in a posing bikini , my body oiled , my G-string tight , my gluteals twice the size they were when my parents last saw me three years ago . They called to say I looked nice . <p> " Things sure change , " my father said . <p> " Yes , " my mother said . " In my day even the men were flabby . " <p> " I was skinny like a fence , " my father said . <p> " My father was big , but he did n't have muscle , " my mother said . " His voice was very muscular , though . " <p> " It sure is nice to talk to you , " my father said . <p> " Is that oil on you ? " my mother asked . " You look wet . Is your bikini wet ? I did n't even know you wore bikinis . " <p> " I saw a woman like that at the fair once , " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women here , they would live in the hills , " my mother said . " They would shoot guns . " <p> Without thinking , I told them what I had been telling them for years about all my activities . " It 's normal . Everyone does it . " <p> " If you were here , you would live in the hills . You would shoot guns , too . You just like to fight , " my mother said , and for a moment I felt exposed . I touched my stomach scar , the scar I should get removed , Linda tells me , the scar that reminds me of the real anger I saw that night in the cantina I went to looking for the yellow shirt , for the barrio boy and his gun , but only finding an angry man with a knife . He had the kind of anger , the kind of face I so seldom see at my air-conditioned job or at Linda 's desert home . He was yelling at the wall when I walked in , seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to look around after a long day of bank meetings and numbers . <p> " Pendejos , " he yelled . He was sweating , drinking from a bottle , spinning around to make sure no one was behind him . Everyone else was standing against the wall farthest from the man , drinking or staring . I stood at the door , understanding his intensity , wanting to touch the man , to taste some of his emotion . He looked at me when I did , and then my shirt was split , and there was blood staining my expensive suit as everyone ran out behind us . <p> And so it is difficult to have this scar removed , even when the judges at bodybuilding events tell me they ca n't see my abdominals clearly enough with a scar like that in the way . They say it looks like cheating , like I have muscles where I should n't . <p> Because I have scars I do n't want my parents to see , because I sometimes believe what my mother says about guns , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this I tell them I will never visit them , never fly three thousand miles away from the sandy dryness of this Phoenix desert . But sometimes I do imagine living in Peru . Sometimes I imagine coming out of bushes surrounded by mist and rain , wearing green camouflage , wearing large earrings and someone else 's muddy boots that do n't fit . I would be a guerrilla with muscles , and go to villages to tell people they must stop buying food with English or Japanese writing on the labels . I will tell them that potatoes are better , more natural , more Peruvian , and less capitalistic . But when I dream of this , they all say they 're bored with potatoes . They say they hate imported beans . <p> " We are n't Peruvians , either , " they say in my dreams . <p> While I 'm awake , after workouts , I sit in locker room saunas , imagining that in South America I would be a woman with a shoulder-slung AK-47 . I would have to keep pushing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook different potato dishes through frying and basting and breadifying . But these Aymaras do n't listen . They draw pictures of cars and curry women in the dark Peruvian mud and look at each other . Sometimes I imagine flexing for them when I help lift boxes full of market vegetables ready to sell for guns . When I 'm flexing they touch my white , muscled skin with their fingernails . I want to name my muscles for them , say " deltoid " and " latissimus , " but those words do n't come to me without dictionaries . <p> These people call me transparent in my dreams . <p> " You look like coca leaves , " they tell me . I smile because they say that is the highest compliment to give a white person in Peru , even if I am really a mestizo . <p> Sometimes as I lie on the carpeted weight room floor , the one that is safe from guns and full of white men who want to do things to me but never will , that is when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian women there put lipstick on my lips and arms so they can see it stain . <p> " You are like rocks at low elevations , " they say . " Large and smooth . " They seem to like this drawing time we share . They smile as their lipstick leaves marks like dark berries on my skin . <p> " You 've got to get that out of your mind , " Linda says , rubbing my scar , trying to make it fade before the judges complain . " Peru is no place for a woman with muscles . " <p> I am sitting on an old examination bed in the auditorium hallway before my first competition , before my first time flexing in bikini , in oil , in public . This will be the picture I send my parents later , the one they will think is nice , the one where I 'm oiled in bikini , on a bed with a hand over my scar as if I were laughing so hard I had to hold my stomach in . I tell Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see her face that is so thin and ravaged by the life and cigarettes they would call evil . <p> Men in dark suits walk by as Linda takes pictures of me and my muscles so my parents can see what I am doing to myself . She puts oil on my lats as men ask me questions about my bodybuilding past , how long I 've competed , how much I weigh , what my biceps ' circumference is . <p> " You are a big one , " these men tell me , making me get on a scale . It says one hundred forty-two , the most I have weighed without fat . <p> " She has to concentrate , " Linda says , moving in front of them , snapping her fingers at me to help me focus . <p> In the bathroom she opens a makeup kit for me and we start to put powders and colors on my face , bits at a time . She puts eye-liner in my hand , but all I do is hold it . <p> " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing at my eyelid . <p> " A little charcoal , " I say . I am dazed , staring and hot from a lack of food , not sweating from a lack of water , nervous about showing my body off in front of yelling crowds , in front of suited men . My fingers are twitching with shaky nerves and a low supply of electrolytes . This is normal , everyone says , and everyone does it , they all say , so there must be some kind of safety . <p> " You ca n't afford to bloat , " they say . <p> I have learned that safety is not a word for them . Food and bloated stomachs and saturated skin cells are foreign , evil things . I think of bloating , my skin swelling a little , my muscle cuts fading into a mush like Darryl 's body , the man I once almost loved , especially for his cooking . My stomach growls as I think of his recipes , so I think of the Andes instead , of bodies bloating in bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different reasons . These would be the ones who got too dose to people with guns on a windy day , my mother might tell me . Maybe if it were windy here , I , too , would want to get a gun out , a gun I will maybe buy later , or take from a barrio boy . I think of him again , the boy in yellow , even though I know Linda would not approve if she knew . I think of the way he touched my arm , pushed his fingernails into the muscle , leaving red marks . <p> " You think you 're big , " he said . I lay there on a dusty bench , still holding the barbell above in its metal support arms , feeling the pressure of veins in my neck as I became speechless and angry . " If you were a woman , I 'd fuck you . " He laughed , then looked at the door as if someone he had been running from might come in , blasting . <p> And if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I might get the same kind of gun he had , and if I take it out , I may try to blow away some sneering boy in yellow who thinks he can touch me and laugh . I would leave this kind of boy in the weeds close to a baseball field , later to be found by children . <p> But in Phoenix , the winds are hot and slow , and seldom do white women like me shoot hot bullets . <p> " Your eyes are slightly dilated . Make a fist for a few minutes , " Linda tells me now , her voice so quiet . I can feel heat rising in my neck . All colors and objects at this cheap bodybuilding contest seem far away . I 'm beginning not to care what my face looks like or what kind of color Linda is putting on me . <p> " I do n't care , " I tell Linda . " Everything is fuzzy . " I look at her , and her eyes are dark blue but speaking foreign languages . Navajo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is blond and does her laundry at home while watching the news , while wishing for the cigarettes she gave up years ago . When she sits in the kitchen , wanting to smoke , her mouth says unspiritual things about sex and hate no matter how much she burns sage and reads her Navajo books , telling me she wants to live in Sedona Arizona and become holy like her Navajo relatives . <p> " That 's why we ca n't kiss , " she tells me at night . " You and I need to be empty and clean . We need to be invisible . " She sits on the carpet and , instead of smoking , paints her nails in un-Navajo fruit colors as I fall asleep on her bed and feel my large quads twitching . <p> " Close your eyes , " she tells me now in the auditorium bathroom that smells of sweaty competition and chlorine . These are the smells of powders and perfume that muscular women use to make their faces look less like machines . In front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of a pencil eyeliner that drags my skin into clumps when I do it myself . But Linda 's fingers are cool as they hold my chin . She spritzes my forehead and puts on the sweet-smelling base . Light rouge is brushed on quickly , the brush pricking my cheeks . Then the sparkling powder she says the judges will like in those lights is blown on to hold it all in . <p> " That 's not me , " I say at the mirror . My face has changed . It looks like the face I see on so many other women as they try to do what their bosses tell them . <p> " That 's much more you , " my mother says when she sees the close-up photo , me in makeup and an almost real hairdo with small curls . I would not go to a barrio with this kind of makeup . I would not pack a gun with this hair . <p> " You are so pretty , " my parents say . But no one ever calls me pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in the way , and when I flex them , I think of flaky pastries and Irish Cream , things I can not eat . I think of Peruvian villagers touching me with charcoal fingers . I think of clenching my buttocks for the judges . I do n't think of being pretty . <p> Now , onstage for the first time , I unprettily flex for the first time in front of a large audience , and the dizziness of bright lights and cigarette smoke make me want to just stop moving and fall onto the stage floor in front of the judges . But I know Linda is out there looking at me , saying magical words for me , so I avoid falling by not moving my feet or doing any twisting or turning . I flex in place , and still , I get applause . <p> When I work , I am corporate , letting my barbell-calloused hands finesse bank statements , allowing my muscular lips to tell people if they can have ten thousand dollars or not . At work , I wield the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " You are so bourgeois , " Linda says , though she herself wields power with the governor of our Arizona . She is his supreme executive secretary . She helps him understand that the blueprints he makes have an effect on his spirituality . She points out that the way he walks and thinks can put holes where they were n't meant to be in a desert that does n't want them . <p> " But you wear two-hundred-dollar suits , " I tell Linda , trying to find inconsistencies in a woman who lives for contradiction . <p> " My suits are natural , Yours are not , " she says . <p> This is sometimes the only thing we talk about anymore when weights are n't being pulled or magical Navajo words are n't being invoked or I 'm not watching yellow desert storms . <p> Still , I do feel sorry when I 'm in my expensive and unnatural power suits , sitting over oak desks with clients . Last month I tried to buy some suits in a donation center , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw my clean , tanned white skin , my impractical leather shoes , my too finely combed hair , all in somebody else 's unwanted , crumpled suit . She knew I was a fraud . <p> At work , I 've been nothing but problems with my occasional discount suits and bulging body . <p> " No one has thighs like that , " my boss says . He calls me in a lot now . Lately I 've had trouble saying no to men in cowboy hats and large belt buckles who want ten thousand dollars to start iguana purse factories in Peoria . I want to tell my boss that money does n't mean that much , that people should be able to buy any kind of purse they want , and that I should be able to let them . <p> " I think people like unique accessories , " I tell my boss . <p> " This is n't California . " He always breathes a lot when I 'm in his office , wanting to ask me to flex for him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , he watches my calf muscles as I walk . <p> Though I have been at the bank for years , now that I am big , the cameras there follow me more often as I walk clients to the outer offices , or take copy jobs to the secretaries , or stop to stare at the women in yellow shirts . As I walk up and down with spreadsheets and financial profiles , these cameras quietly spin in any direction on high-tech hydraulics , zooming in on parts of my legs , I 'm sure , or my thick neck with the turn of a lens . Linda tells me it 's just jealousy , that people have always wanted to look at what they ca n't have . <p> " Even I still get stares , " she tells me , almost flexing her thin arm . " A body like this can hypnotize . " <p> " I do n't think it 's jealousy , " I tell her . I always look behind me now when I walk around the office , trying not to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the early evenings when Linda is working late at the capitol , telling the governor how to behave , I watch as the sun bleaches the yards in our neighborhood , turns all the cactus gardens full of painted rocks white , and all the lawns light yellow . Linda 's house is too close to the desert for such civilized things to survive . Dust and jackrabbits eat away at any hints of excess or careful pruning . Javelinas with their wild pig snouts and black hair lie dead and bloating on the eighteenth hole of nearby executive golf courses , unaware of the havoc their smelling bodies cause . <p> I clean my short , practical nails while the dust storms of late summer hit , burying newly planted sod , blowing quartz crystals from rock gardens into the road , bending the tall yuccas people have brought in from our backyard desert to see if they would grow next to roses and purple snapdragons . Our neighbors pat manure around the base of their yuccas , but still their hollow stocks bend , still their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in out of the dust and swirling desert bushes . <p> When it 's dark and the monsoon lightning storms are flashing by South Mountain , I read makeup magazines to improve my skills for Linda and the judges , or at least that is what I tell Linda . Lately , I 've become more interested in the bras than the eyeliners or lipsticks . There is always a lure to a piece of clothing you have n't worn for years , the containment of it unneeded for so long . I look at the advertising photos , trying to remember if I ever had breasts like that , and what it might have felt like to hold them , to even be able to lift them up or see them sway . Linda made my breasts disappear long ago with all her reps and diets . Now these magazine bras and women 's bodies seem so foreign , they pull my eyes in . Sometimes , when the models all look pillowy and full of curves , I have to cut out pictures of them in their Maidenforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office so Linda wo n't see . She would say they were a distraction . <p> " Women 's bodies will break you , " she would say . <p> When it 's lunchtime and the office is eating in , licking fallen mayonnaise off their desks while clients wait outside , I look at my bra pictures , and at these bra models without stomach muscles . Their mammaries would shock the bodybuilding world . I touch the glossy pages where the bras are highlighted . I tabulate interest rates for my next client , and think of calling the phone number at the bottom of one bra ad , a 1800 number for sharing bra mishaps and complaints about fit and color and unnatural rashes , problems I have n't had for years . <p> There are days when I watch my clients waiting , sitting , and cleaning their own nails as they hope they 've told me the right things to receive the big loans . I watch the camera in front of my office as it zooms in on them and their fidgeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera in the outer office focuses on me through my executive window , I tabulate figures more rapidly , and think of phoning that number , of calling up the bra receptionists who no doubt have big breasts , who I 'm sure wear nothing but a bra when they talk to their callers so assuredly . <p> One day , after a night of dreaming , a night full of starvation dreams and yellow-shirted Hispanic men , I do call , right there after lunch , my boss walking by my door every so often to try and look at my leg muscles hidden by desk . I listen to the computerized messaging service and push buttons until a real person talks . <p> " Service Center , " a woman says . <p> " I have a lot of questions . Do I just start asking them ? " I look up and wave first at my client , then at my boss . <p> " That 's what we 're here for . " <p> " Do you know about underwires ?

I want to ask her what her body looks like , if it is like the model on the page in my hand . I want to tell her I lied , that I do n't have the kind of body that requires the extra support of bras , but I do n't say anything about this . <p> " Do you enjoy talking to women ?

" I ask women I have picked from the phone book , drinking soda water after soda water that Linda has told me will make me bloat . No doubt tomorrow she will see it , the bloating , the soda water coming out of my pores , the empty bottles covered over in the kitchen trash can . This is all I can do when Linda wo n't let me binge , when she tells me bloating would be like death for someone with a body like mine . <p> But there are times when being reckless is all that keeps me from lying on the couch for days without moving just to feel the slow atrophy of muscle , and the invisibility of being still . <p> When I talk about bras to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using my best corporate voice to make them talk . <p> " We are doing a bra survey this evening , " I say , sipping . <p> " Are you selling them ? " the women on the phone ask . When I tell them I 'm not selling , they always want to buy , they always want to ask me the questions I wanted to ask the woman with the hotline service . <p> " What stores do you usually buy your brassieres in , madam ? " I try to remember the days when I would walk into a store and try bras on , the saleswoman bringing me different sizes and colors , asking me if she could come in to see how they fit . <p> " Bra stores ? " says the woman on the phone . " Frank will only buy me red ones , but they stain my skin . " I look at the front door to make sure Linda is n't opening it as I ask for more details , as I pry into another woman 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour as I tease them with a potential sale or a new bra that would drive any man or woman crazy . This is all I can think to do some nights when it 's too hot for kissing or knife fights , and my body seems so big and unnecessary , so fearful of movement , so holy it starts to disappear beneath me . <p> After a workout of fast moving squats , and slow pull-downs needed to emphasize my obliques , I walk slowly up weight room stairs to the gray company car I will drive to Linda 's desert house , my muscles acid-filled and heavy . As I walk , I think of Darryl , my lovely , fat ex , and his cooking , his sticky sweet kisses many months away now , but living only a few blocks down from Linda 's . <p> " Darryl will make you bloat , " Linda tells me , afraid her former bodybuilding partner will do to me what he did to her , make me bloat , make me want to lie on couches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Darryl says . " She 'll sap your muscles right out from under you . " He is always chewing on the phone . His cooking noises make my holy and deprived stomach squirm . <p> " Darryl will kill you , " Linda says . " Darryl has killed many things . " She always goes into the kitchen when she speaks about him . She talks about his bloated body while holding imaginary cigarettes between her fingers . Sometimes ! see Darryl outside on his sandy desert lawn , walking around his house in flowered shirts , his legs strangely white . These legs of his make me want to talk to him , smell the richness of his cooking , binge once again with him until we are in comas . <p> " I 'm thinner now , " I tell Darryl on the phone , secretly , hiding in the bathroom while Linda makes lettuce sandwiches . <p> " I could make you the most incredible chocolate cheesecake , " he says . " Syrup dripping off the top . " <p> " God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I can see the cord , " she says . " Tell Darryl to fuck off . " <p> " Fuck off , honey , " I tell my old boyfriend who wants to make me fat so I will stay with him . <p> " That was n't a very holy thing to say , " I tell Linda later after I 've hung up . I walk into the kitchen and pinch at my very thin skin for her , slap at my heavy quads for her to see my transparent leanness . " He says I 'm too thin . " <p> " That 's the idea , " Linda says . " Lean and nothing but sinew and fiber . That 's the only way to win . " She touches my cheek with a fingernail , pinches at my gluteals , but there is nothing to pinch when I 'm flexing . <p> At night when Linda is painting her nails or learning new Navajo words , I sometimes think of Darryl kissing me in the desert like he once used to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under bushes . That is sometimes what I think of as I fall asleep with celibate but muscular lips , trying to feel the imaginary sand between my fingers , the kiss of Darryl 's sweetness , and as I dream of Darryl instead of the color yellow , Linda and her nail-polish smells fade . <p> In the afternoons after a day of banking and bra phone calls , after yelling " pendejo " at every barrio boy I see from the safety of my car , I like to run through the tall saguaros and junipers in the desert behind Linda 's house , the desert Darryl once kissed me in , sand and dead lizards hitting the backs of my calves like they used to hit the backs of Darryl 's calves when he would run , when his body was as hard as mine . I like the way sand sticks to my shoulders and hair , and I do sprints as snakes sidewind patterns on the trail in front of me . This is where children play behind our neighborhood houses , hide behind prickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the skin of their hands melt on anything they touch . <p> This is the place I watch these children from as I run on a circular path , the one all the husbands and ex-husbands run on in the mornings when the snakes have receded . They tell me their running makes them more aggressive at work . But for me , it is a way of celebrating , of knowing I am more powerful than others . My boss himself lives down the street by Darryl , and he runs here in the mornings , but his eyes make me nervous . His children watch Linda and me in the kitchen as we almost kiss over tabouli salads on the weekends , Linda always pulling away and smiling . <p> Still , my boss knows I 'm a banker who can kill with a look , who can bleed loan payments out of clients with a word on the fax that makes their secretaries feel fear . And so he hesitates to fire me . What he does n't know is that I 'm a loan officer almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the heat is pushing in on me , when the winds are blowing in Peru , when my body is even more of a foreign thing my parents will not have any words for . <p> Maybe when I have a gun , and I have sat polishing its blueness for hours , and felt the movement of its parts , maybe then I will even shoot at people in South Phoenix during the sandy season if Linda and her constant flow of words and starvation tactics keep pushing my adrenaline to new highs . Maybe if I ca n't stop thinking of that sneering barrio boy in the empty weight room , of being alone with him , his gun in my face , my large muscles immobilized , unmoving , useless , if I ca n't stop thinking of the yellowness of that , maybe then shooting will be the only release . <p> " I kill with a flex , " I say before every competition , and in every mirror , trying to believe it . " My muscles can flatten you , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say as I drive by cantinas in South Phoenix , wishing it were true . <p> <p> By LEE ANN MORTENSEN <p>
