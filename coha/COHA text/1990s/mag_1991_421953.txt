Section : ONE FAMILY 'S FINANCES A lottery winner who 's used up half her prize needs to save more of what 's left to come . <p> Everything 's a gamble , marriage included , " muses Jim Jackman , 70 , settling into a beach chair on his backyard sun deck . " They said ours would never last , " quips Agnes , 66 , his wife of 45 years , lying in a chair between him and their sleepy 11-year-old mutt Sparky . " I guess we were lucky . " <p> In fact , much in the couple 's two-bedroom bungalow in suburban Tarrytown , N.Y. , 25 miles north of New York City , testifies to faith m a benevolent fortune . There 's the horseshoe nailed over the patio door ; the state lottery tickets scattered on the table ; the paper cup filled with quarters that Jim won playing Joker Poker slot machines in Atlantic City . Even as they watch their favorite TV program , Wheel of Fortune , the affable , raspy-voiced , chain-smoking couple guess along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not : lucky tonight . " Says Jim , " Ah , but you were when it counted . " <p> That was on May 22 , 1980 , when Agnes won a cool $1 million in the New York State Lottery . ( The three tickets that qualified her for the finalists ' drawing are shown above . ) She gets 20 installments of $50,000 , less taxes , paid each May until 1.999 . Today , though , with 12 of the 20 checks in ( this year 's was for $36,325 ) , the Jackmans are starting to worry about what they will do ) when the bonanza runs out . Not that they squandered their winnings . True , they went on a modest spending spree , selling their cramped three-bedroom cottage for $35,000 to buy their present home for $68,000 , and splurging on a $5,000 1980 Chevy Chevette ( " first new car we ever had , " says Jim ) . But the money has n't changed a frugal lifestyle that Agnes describes as " very boring . Jim gardens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vermont cost $1,000 . Fancy dinners ? They 'd rather order Chinese food from the corner restaurant . Credit-card binges ? Forget it  --  this couple has no debt at all . <p> Their problem , apart from the fact that $50,000 a year buys 40% less than it did in 1980 , is that the windfall induced them to quit their jobs . That 's unusual ; Bill Bergman , executive director of the North American Association of State &; Provincial Lotteries , says most big-time winners keep working despite their windfalls . But as soon as the first $40,000 check was deposited in the bank , Agnes , then 55 , clumped her $7,000-a-year part-time gig as a legal secretary . Jim , 59 , followed a few months later , retiring from his . $15,000-a-year job as a maintenance man for a nonprofit organization that rebuilt historic Hudson River Valley homes . <p> And why not ? That after-tax $40,000 was 80% higher than the before-tax $22,000 sum of their salaries . With all the extra money lying around , Agnes also began " to give , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are three : Jim III , 43 ; Bob , 40 ; and Tom , 34 . Over the years , they have received more than $50,000 in cash and such big-ticket gifts as a $500 snowblower , a $400 aboveground pool and a $450 outdoor jungle gym for Bob 's three sons . Plus , Agnes gives about $2,000 a year to church and charitable groups . <p> As a result , though Agnes hopes to have $100,000 put aside when the lottery checks stop , she 's salted away only $43,350 , including $11,000 in a surge of saving over the past 12 months , Some $30,350 is in bank passbook accounts paying a scant 5% . The remaining $13,000 is in Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds , now paying 6.57% , that she buys at her local bank . The couple 's nonlottery income is mostly Social Security and pension checks totaling only $12,000 a year . " Is that enough to live on ? " Agnes asks rhetorically . " Please ! " Planning for their post-lottery-check years is all the more urgent since a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 years , on average , and a female Agnes ' age another 17 . <p> Yet Agnes , who handles the books ( " I want nothing to do with money other than spending it , " jokes her husband ) , still puts some $50 a week into lottery tickets while refusing to invest in higher-earning assets like stocks or bonds . Says she : " As a gambler , I know how to lose , but only small amounts . Investing means risking more than I can afford . " <p> As for her generosity to their sons , Agnes defends it as a family tradition . " It 's what my folks did for us , " she says , citing the free housing her parents supplied the young couple after they were married in 1946 . Jim , a ruggedly handsome ex-Golden Gloves boxer whose father was a line-worker at Tarrytown 's General Motors plant , had . just returned from World War II duty in England as an Air Force noncom ( " I did n't see much action except in Piccadilly Circus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fucheck , his pretty high school sweetheart and the daughter of a Czech immigrant who also worked at GM . Jim found a $2,700-a-year job driving tractor trailers for the car-transport company Anchor Motor Freight , and the newlyweds ' first home was an attic apartment in the Fuchecks ' North Tarrytown house . That economy allowed Agnes to follow the custom of the day and resign her $25-a-week secretarial job to stay at home . <p> By 1958 the Jackmans had three sons and a $75-a-month rented apartment in Tarrytown when the Teamsters Union local to which Jim belonged struck Anchor Motor . " It was a terrible time , " Agnes remembers . " The landlord had Jim paint our apartment building because we had no cash to pay the rent , my mom bought our groceries , and I went back to secretarial work , for $1.50 an hour . " A year dragged by before Jim found steady employment as a $100-a-week metal finisher at GM . Worried about health risks from exposure to metal and paint dust in the plant , he left GM in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind but the $6,000 starting salary was less than the $8,600 GM had paid him . <p> The Jackmans never made enough to build college funds for their sons , but all three attended the State University of New York nonetheless . The two older boys paid their own way , but when youngest son Tom enrolled in 1974 , his parents could help cover his tuition and add a few hundred dollars ' spending money each semester . By then their only debt was a $5,000 mortgage on the cottage they bought in 1964 for $8,000 . Had life gone as they expected , Agnes says , " we 'd have worked until we could n't work any more , and then retired . " <p> The lottery changed all that , giving them instant leisure and enough money to trade up to a bigger house . They accepted a $12,000 down payment on the old one and gave the buyers a $23,000 , 20-year mortgage at 10% . That loan brings in a steady $222 a month , with a $1.6,000 balance still to be paid off . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took out a $50,000 loan , for 10 years at 12% , which they retired last year . Jim started adding improvements , like the well-stocked paneled bar under the sign reading JIM 'S PLACE that he installed in the basement . " We bought a used Dodge Aspen station wagon just to cart the lumber , " says Agnes . Thanks to the renovations and a rising market , the property is now worth $220,000 . <p> Agnes ' jackpot also freed the Jackmans of their habitual anxiety about spending . " What I liked best as a winner was going to the supermarket and not having to check the prices , " says Agnes . That , in turn , helped to loosen her natural generosity . " Agnes is just happier buying other people presents , " observes her brother , Father Bob Fucheck , a Roman Catholic priest in Melbourne , Fla. , " like the $100 alb an ecclesiastical vestment she gave me . " <p> Perhaps the greatest beneficiary has been son Tom . " The summer after she won , Mom financed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend , " he reports . " That fall I moved to Alaska , and she staked me to a start-up . She still sends me $1,000 every year . But the best thing about her winning the lottery is that I wo n't ever have to worry about her being taken care of . " <p> Maybe so . But his brother Bob , who earned an M.B.A . in 1983 at Long Island University , is less certain . " Mom puts everything in bank accounts and savings bonds , " he says . " I tell her , Ma , you should go for growth . Why did I go to school if you 're not gon na listen to me ? Get into a mutual fund  --  or at least a CD . ' But she says , No , I want security . ' " <p> Agnes responds that despite her taste for wagers , she does n't want to test her luck on anything she considers risky . " If I have to raise money after the lottery checks run out , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , she 'll keep buying those lottery tickets . " Who knows , I might win big again . After all , they say money goes to money . " <p> Reached a few days later , Agnes said she had " definitely decided to cut back on gifts to the boys  --  they 've gotten the major stuff they need . But I probably wo n't follow the rest of the advice . I 've heard a lot of it before from my son Bob , but I 'm a stubborn old coot . " As for the suggestion that she give up the lottery , she said , " I ca n't . What If I did n't play the numbers and they won ? " THE ADVICE The Problems : <p> How to save more and invest for higher returns while still preserving security The Solutions : <p> Cut back on gifts , and invest in money-market funds , CDs and Treasuries . <p> At MONEY 's invitation , Gary Schatsky , a fee-only planner with offices in New York City and Albany , N.Y . offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noting that Agnes spent $13,000 on gifts last year , Schatsky told her to rein in her charity . " Unless your sons need help , cut their annual gifts to $1,000 apiece and boost your savings from last year 's $11,000 to $21,000 . In eight years , you 'll have more than $225,000 , including the $43,350 you 've already saved , plus interest . At 8% interest , that money will generate more than $18,000 a year in income . That amount , plus your $12,000 pension and Social Security benefits , will support you despite inflation . Then you wo n't need a home-equity loan  --  which you might not qualify for anyway without the extra $18,000 . " <p> Go for higher returns . Schatsky chided Agnes for keeping : $30,350 in a 5% passbook account . " Everyone needs an emergency fund , " he said , " but : given your cash flow , yours should be $20,000 tops  --  and it 's in the wrong place . Close out the account and put $20,000 of it into a money-market : fund like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's currently absorbing management fees and paying 6% that 's exempt from New York State tax  --  equivalent to 6.4% in a fully taxable stash . " He advised putting the passbook 's remaining $10,350 in an FDIC-insured bank certificate of deposit with a three- or five-year maturity to lock in a rate of 7.7% or 8.3% , respectively . " And stop investing in Series EE bonds , " Schatsky said . " Even though they offer tax-deferred interest , it 's only 6.57% . Put your other $13,000 savings into five-year Treasury notes . You 'll earn 7.96% free of state tax , which equals a fully taxable 8.44% , . Federal Reserve Banks sell the notes at no charge . " <p> Smiling , Schatsky added , " I know this wo n't go over big with somebody who won $1 million , but spending $2,500 on lottery tickets each year is a bad investment . You get only about $0.50 in winnings for every dollar you bet  --  and that 's a lousy return . " Banking the winnings After years of spending most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save $11,000 of the money over the past year .
