txt // This chapter addresses the manufacturing component of the overall corporate strategy . Accordingly , the focus is on defining and implementing a TMA-based strategy to control product reliability , safety , and quality . The goals of a manufacturing strategy are to eliminate product performance losses during manufacture , gain customer confidence and preference , capture market share , and enhance corporate profitability over the long term . II . STRATEGIC PLANNING Strategic planning involves several fundamental tasks : strategy formulation , strategy implementation , and evaluation and control 1 . Strategy formulation is the development of long-range plans to deal effectively with environmental opportunities and threats in light of corporate strengths and weaknesses . This consists of defining the corporate mission , specifying achievable objectives , developing strategies , and setting policy guidelines . Strategy implementation is the process of putting strategies and policies into action through the development of various programs , budgets , and . Finally , evaluation and control include the process of monitoring corporate strategic activities and results . From this evaluation , an assessment is made of actual performance relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complex activity . We have to formulate our strategy , implement it , and then monitor it to see if it works to a satisfactory level . But before a company can perform the latter two activities , it is necessary to have in place a comprehensive and complete strategic manufacturing plan . A strategic manufacturing plan implies several key ideas . First , a corporatewide strategy is defined based on input from some of the most innovative , visionary , and pragmatic minds in the company . Second , the focus is on manufacturing , and very likely some specific product line(s) . Third , a detailed plan is developed reflecting realistic goals , objectives , timing milestones , and cost estimates . The functional elements of a strategic manufacturing plan are depicted in Figure 1 . Two major inputs that impact the planning process are illustrated : the business and the tactical strategic considerations . ( Tactical strategic considerations are addressed later in this chapter . ) A third input is also depicted . This input , often overlooked , is the product itself . In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quality , there are critical attributes that can make or break the ability to gain customer preference and market share . Rational manufacturing decisions are based on the defined strategic issues surrounding the corporation as a whole and , particularly , the product(s) to // be manufactured . Several key issues include market share potential , prob ability of success , and return on investment ( ROI ) . The market share potential for a given product varies with the growth char acteristics of the specific market to be entered ( assuming that successful prod uct technology transfer occurs ) . Market share potential directly affects the probability of commercial success and the ROI that may be seen . Figure 2 depicts the relationship between ROI and probability of commercial success as a function of market share potential . These strategic issues are a direct reflection of the consumers ' impression of product reliability , safety , and quality . Therefore , it makes sense to de velop and implement a strategic manufacturing plan that enhances product commercialization success potential and ROI . Baseline product reliability , safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . The significance of these product attributes is evidenced in the extensive profit impact of market strat egy ( PIMS ) data base 2 . The PIMS data implies that the definition of prod uct reliability , safety , and quality requirements is strongly dictated by market issues . This is extended to emphasize their driving position influence in achiev ing high market share , ROI , and successful commercialization . A key influence in structuring the manufacturing plan is the nature of the market to be entered . As shown in Figure 2 , whether market pull or mar ket push exists strongly affects the required product reliability , safety , and quality . Market pull indicates the situation where the product is highly de-sired by the consumer and will be readily received in filling a market void . Market push indicates the situation where the product is not highly desired by the consumer and , consequently , must be made desirable to the consumer . We stated earlier that for a product to be successful it must be designed with the proper levels of reliability , safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one of its primary objectives , the // need to control and maintain these inherent product performance attributes . The customer should get the product as designed , and not some degraded version of the original design . A sound framework for adequately addressing manufacturing strategy is-sues is the strategic market management approach 3 . Strategic market man agement is designed to help precipitate and make strategic decisions . A strat egic decision involves the creation , change , or retention of a strategy . An important role is to precipitate , as well as make , strategic decisions . Figure 3 shows a pyramid of the analyses that provide the input to strategy develop ment and the strategic decisions that are the ultimate output . As illustrated in the figure , two fundamental analysis areas aid strategic formulation : ex ternal analysis and internal analysis . External analysis consists of examining variables that exist outside the corporation , which typically are not within the short-term control of manage ment . Specific analyses performed include ( 1 ) customer analysis to identify // customer segments , motivations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies ' strategies , objectives , cultures , costs , strengths , and weaknesses ; ( 3 ) industry analysis to identify current size , potential growth , available distribution systems , entry barriers , and success factors ; and ( 4 ) en vironmental analysis to identify factors of existing technologies , government controls , cultures , demographics , and economics . Internal analysis consists of examining variables within the corporation . These variables also are not typically within the short-term control of man agement . Specific analyses include ( 1 ) performance analysis to identify cur-rent and projected return on assets , market share , product value and per formance , cost , new product activity , corporate culture , productivity , and product portfolios ; and ( 2 ) historical experience analysis to identify past and current strategies , problem areas , organizational capabilities and con straints , financial resources available , and corporate flexibility . Once a strategic manufacturing plan is defined , it should be evaluated relative to several issues . These include ( 1 ) internal consistency , ( 2 ) consistency // with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 4 ) acceptable level of risk , ( 5 ) appropriate time horizon , and ( 6 ) overall feasibility . Internal consistency refers to the cumulative impact of a strategy on organizational objectives . Consistency with the environment refers to strategy compatibility with what is going on outside the organization . Capabilities of available resources refers to what an organization has to help it achieve its objectives . Balance must be achieved between strategies and resources . The acceptable level of risk refers to the uncertainty of strategies . Different strategies involve different risks ( both internal and external ) , and management must establish its risk preferences . As time horizons increase , risk increases , particularly in unstable markets . The appropriate time horizon refers to the time period over which the strategies are be followed . The overall feasibility refers to the workability of strategies on a practical level . For a manufacturing strategic plan to be successful , it must be compatible with all the strategic components involved in the corporation and with the particular product strategy . Typically , there are four product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) follow-the-leader , ( 3 ) applications-oriented , and ( 4 ) production efficient 4. 1 . Market leader strategy . An intense product research and development ( R/D ) and engineering effort is implemented . Technical leadership is exerted through large financial investment(s) . This strategy involves a high degree of risk , and usually only large organizations with substantial resources are able to adopt this posture , because the corporation must be able to absorb financial mistakes . 2 . Follow-the-leader strategy . This strategy involves minor product research but a strong development and engineering effort . It requires a rapid technical response to new products developed by market leaders . Manufacturing and marketing expertise are also vital to success . The market is generally entered with a competing product during the growth stage of the product life cycle . 3 . Applications-oriented strategy . This strategy involves minor product R/D but a strong engineering effort . The focus is on developing product modifications to serve a particular , specialized , or limited market segment . The market is generally entered during the maturity stage of the product life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little product R/D and engineering effort but a strong manufacturing effort . It is based on achieving superior manufacturing efficiency and cost control . Competition in price and delivery are paramount . The market is generally entered during the maturity stage of the product life cycle . A preference for manufacturing strategies with greater flexibility is desirable . Strategies that permit corrective action and adjustment are better than those that can not be changed once they are implemented . // A. Product Assurance Strategy 1 . Reliability , Safety , and Quality Issues The product reliability , safety , and quality requirements are a key part of the overall manufacturing plan . As stated earlier , this is supported by the PI MS data base . These performance parameters provide a basis for defining the product assurance strategy necessary as part of the overall manufacturing strategy . Developing a product assurance strategic plan involves balancing many interrelated variables and factors . These include 1 . Establishing quantitative product performance goals ( mean time between failure , mean time to repair , service life , defectivity level , and so forth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective management control program to guide the product development effort and provide timely outputs consistent with major design and program decision points 3 . Performing and implementing analyses and quality checks , audits , and controls to ensure that all test , inspection , and screen data are complete and acceptable 4 . Performing a fully coordinated product development program that emphasizes failure analysis and corrective action and provides growth and verification of specified design requirements 5 . Establishing a set of documentation through which conformance to the product assurance strategy is assessed and tracked 6 . Exposing design deficiencies and initiating corrective action in a timely manner 7 . Improving product operational availability to enhance the probability of commercial success 8 . Reducing the need for maintenance and logistic support ( reduce lifecycle costs ) 9 . Identifying , evaluating , and eliminating design hazards and risks 10 . Applying historical data , including lessons learned from other development projects , to the design process 11 . Minimizing unforeseen impacts on overall project cost and schedule The product assurance strategy provides an organized method of ensuring that the above factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development program . With a strategy developed and documented , it is possible to initiate a properly planned program . Such a program ensures that critical project decisions involving significant investment of resources are keyed to the achievement of specific reliability , safety , and quality requirements , as well as other performance requirements . // The specific program objectives depend on the uniqueness of the technology under consideration , the nature of the product , the customer , and other factors as appropriate . Merely defining a product assurance strategy orients product development and , ultimately , manufacture toward a practical , serviceable , and affordable commercial product . A product assurance strategy promotes and enables trade-off analyses between design and test engineering fucntions . Once implemented , it avoids duplication of effort and minimizes the probability of omitting essential elements . Always remember that there is an intimate relationship between the total product assurance effort and the TMA-based strategic plan . III . TACTICAL PLANNING Tactical manufacturing planning encompasses those planning activities that follow the strategic issues discussed in the previous section . This does not imply that strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise . Rather , in the true spirit of TMA , strategy and tactics should be considered at the same time , as much as possible , so that each planning procedure and decision process may benefit from the interaction with each of the others . Tactical issues , however , can be thought of as subservient to strategic issues , in terms of priority , commitment , and timing . They also include more implementable details and are closer to the nuts and bolts of the business . The time for strategic planning is after answering the following questions : " What should we build ? " " Why should we build it ? " " When should we start building it ? " " How many should we build per day/month/year ? " At this point , tactical issues must be resolved . A new set of questions then arises : " How should we design it ? " " Should we make or buy the parts ? " " How should we manufacture it ? " " How should we assemble it ? " " How should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use ? " " How should we arrange our factory ? " " How should we control our manufacturing processes ? " The activities and essential techniques for addressing these and related issues are presented in the remaining sections of this chapter . // A. Design For Manufacturing An important tactical tool is the philosophy of design for manufacturing ( DFM ) . Although DFM is considered a tactical tool from the perspective of manufacturing planning , it also may be considered a strategic tool ( that is , a farsighted or long-range tool ) from a product-design viewpoint . The idea of DFM is an example of TMA at its best : functions that are traditionally considered separate and sequential are now linked into a simultaneous and symbiotic process . In this case , the two functions are product design and process design . Rather than designing a part merely on the basis of its intended function , we design it with an eye to how best to manufacture it . For example , imagine that several designs have been suggested for a part . Traditionally , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of the part and the costs of materials . Although these considerations are good and proper , they ignore the manufacturing consequences of the decision . What are the process costs of the selected design ? How many machining steps are required ? How many assembly steps , testing steps , and packaging steps ? How many jigs and fixtures will be needed ? How many labor hours ? Can the process be automated ? Can the design be assembled from standard parts ? The trick is to think of the product not as a stand-alone item , but as a part of the entire business enterprise of the corporation . One approach that improves DFM competency is restructuring of design teams . A product development team should include one or more members from process or plant engineering who will have direct input into all design decisions . At the very least , a process representative should be consulted at regular intervals during the design phase . This approach is especially important when a major new product line is being introduced and new facilities are being planned . The functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , plant layout , vendor selection , and equipment selection can and should be performed more or less simultaneously . 1 . DFM Guidelines What are the rules in designing for manufacturability ? Certain guidelines have been established by various industries . Some are more applicable than others in different situations , so they must be adapted to your particular product line and industry . Still , the DFM philosophy is well understood by studying these basic rules . 1 . Reduce the number of parts . With fewer parts in a product , there are fewer drawings required , fewer assembly steps , and less paperwork . The results are lower error rates in both manufacturing and assembly , quicker production time , and increases in both quality and reliability ( because there are fewer parts to fail ) . // 2 . Reduce the number of part numbers . Not only should each product have as few components as possible , but the entire plant should require as few different types of components as possible . Always use a standard or " preferred " part that is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This reduces inventory , paperwork , and chances for assembly errors . 3 . Reduce the number of vendors used . Try to select vendors who can deliver as many components as possible . This simplifies quality validation procedures , reduces the number of shipments needed , and minimizes paperwork and the chances of back orders . 4 . Design for robustness . Robustness is defined as insensitivity of output to variations in the input . Design the product to function correctly and consistently even if component characteristics vary . ( Such variations may be introduced by the manufacturing system. ) 5 . Reduce the number of adjustments needed . Try to eliminate , if possible , the use of adjustable components such as setscrews , tunable electrical components , tensile or compressive fits , and so forth . Attempt to make all assembly steps of the " positive fit " variety , so that as soon as a component is in place , it is ready to function properly . This eliminates the possibility of adjustment errors , increases assembly quality and reliability , and vastly decreases assembly time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it results in an increase in component cost . 6 . Use . foolproof assembly steps . Use components that fit only one way the correct way . Do not use force fits . Try to avoid the use of threaded fasteners ; snap-fit parts are quicker , cheaper , and easier to automate . Use chamfers and other location features to aid in assembly . Sequence assembly steps so that component B can not be inserted until component A has been inserted correctly . The fewer the number of possible assembly errors , the fewer will be the number of actual assembly errors . 7 . Design for vertical stack assembly . Ideally , all components should be assembled along a single axis , like stacking up a sandwich or a pyramid . This reduces the need for reorientation during assembly , makes the process easier to automate , and helps make assembly foolproof ( see previous guideline ) . 8 . Design testing procedures into the product . Accomplish testing with a minimum of disassembly , reorientation , and measurements . The quicker and cheaper testing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To attempt to discuss manufacturing management without an in-depth consideration of computer applications would be foolish . Computers have so permeated the manufacturing field that many volumes can ( and have ) been devoted to the various topics included within the general heading of compuManufacturing // ter-integrated manufacturing ( CIM ) . In this section , we will touch on some highlights and crucial areas and will provide references for further information for the interested reader . C'IM can be arbitrarily broken down into a number of overlapping areas : computer-aided design ( CAD ) , computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM ) , computer-aided process planning ( CAPP ) , computer process control ( CPC ) , and computerized business operations . This section will focus on CAD , CAM , and CAPP , and how they interact with computerized business operations in a general CIM system . CPC topics such as numerical control are discussed in Chapter 5 , under " Automation . " 1 . Computer-Aided Design Computer-aided design is the application of computer technology to the product design function . In the most trivial sense , CAD replaces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil with a computergraphics workstation . This innovation alone supplies several advantages : ? Increased efficiency ? A drafter or designer can easily double productivity by proficient use of a computer-based drafting system . The investment required to convert a drafting department to computer technology is roughly $20,000 to $100,000 per workstation and one to two weeks of training per operator . This investment rapidly pays for itself , particularly if equipment is used for multiple shifts . ? Automatic documentation ? A computer-generated document is easily stored and backed up on a file-server system and can be readily distributed to the departments that require it . It will not degrade with time or with multiple generations of copies , nor will it distort when being reproduced . ? Ease of modification ? If several similar parts are to be drawn , a single file can be modified easily to represent each version with no duplication of effort . This list of advantages , however , ignores the fact that a CAD system is far more than merely an automated drafting board . It is a computer-based system , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following new capabilities become available : ? Automatic design ? Many CAD systems have been developed that automatically draft a component based on a few simple input parameters . For example , a CAD department can easily write a software interface that will query the drafter or designer for the number of poles , coils , and field magnets in a generator , and some basic dimensions , and will then draw it automatically . The time required to draft standard parts using CAD // can be reduced to a mere 1 or 2 percent of the time required to draw parts manually . ? Automatic analysis ? Similarly , a design that has been created in a CAD system can also be linked to an analysis package to quickly and accurately calculate volume , mass , center of gravity , and so on . Finite-element packages can also be linked to CAD systems to do stress analysis , heat dissipation analysis , and so forth . ? Automatic data base ? The CAD system can also be used to perform automatic feature extraction and data base management . Features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted automatically and stored in files to be sent to manufacturing , accounting , or bill-of-materials packages elsewhere in the company . CAD systems are available in a wide variety of configurations , prices , and capabilities . In general , CAD systems consist of the following components : 1 . Graphics hardware . There must be a high-resolution graphics screen capable of displaying large drawings in fine detail . Many of the best screens provide 1024- by 1024-pixel resolution , with up to 1024 colors to choose from . There must also be a graphics input device such as a mouse , trackball , or digitizing pad , in addition to a keyboard . Specialized CAD workstations are available for tens of thousands of dollars , or simple personal computers ( PCs ) can be used for smaller jobs . 2 . Graphics software . Specialized workstations come with software provided , or PC-based software can be purchased separately . Either way , the software includes facilities for creating , modifying , and deleting entities such as circles , lines , points , labels , dimensions , and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped into " layers " that can be hidden or revealed independently of the rest of the drawing . The software will also supply some sort of file management tools . 3 . File server . Large industrial systems often supply a separate computer with large amounts of disk space to store drawing files . The workstations then do not need to store files locally , any workstation can access any drawing , and if a workstation is down for repairs , no data is lost or tied up . For PC-based CAD stations , files are generally stored on the individual computers , unless some sort of local area network has been implemented . 4 . Graphics output device . This is usually a large X-Y plotter , capable of reproducing drawings of any size . It consists of a large flat table on which the blank sheet is mounted . A long movable bar slides back and forth across the table in the Y direction , while a pen slides along the bar , supplying the X motion . Usually the pen is selected from a turret of pens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively , some cheaper CAD systems use dotmatrix printers or laser-writers as output devices , but these tend to be limited in the size of drawings they can output . // 2 . Computer-Aided Manufacturing Computer-aided manufacturing is more complex than CAD and covers a broader range of functions . It can be thought of as the link between CAD and CPC : It takes the data base that was generated and stored by the CAD system and formats , transmits , and prepares the information to be sent to the numerically controlled machine tools on the factory floor . Many incarnations of CAM exist , and each must be tailored for a specific factory and its equipment . Unlike CAD systems , which can be bought offthe-rack by any manufacturing company , a CAM installation is a complex system of many items from many vendors , carefully selected , installed , and orchestrated to implement the automation that the company requires . CAM is best defined by example . Consider a fairly simple installation for drilling holes in circuits boards . A designer in the CAD department has just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new arrangement of holes and circuits on a standard-sized board . A CAM system for this application might start with a custom program that queries the CAD data base and compiles a list of holes to be drilled . The list includes three numbers for each hole : the X and Y location of the center of the hole from some reference point , and the hole diameter . The list also includes the part number of the standard board from which the part will be produced . This list is transmitted via some network to the shop floor . An operator , watching a screen , will see that a board has been ordered . He or she selects the required board from inventory and places it in a CNC ( computer numerically controlled ) drill press . When it is ready , he or she presses a button , and the hole list proceeds to the CNC press , which then drills the required holes . No paper has been generated , and there have been very few opportunities for error . The hole file could even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , which the operator would then have produced . A more complex CAM system could automate many more steps in the production process and could reach more areas of the factory . Parts could be ordered from inventory automatically and delivered by an automated guided vehicle ( AGV ) ( see Chapter 5 ) to the appropriate machine tool . Robots could manipulate the parts onto the machines and deliver them to the final assembly area . As the role of CAM expands in a factory , the overall concept of computerintegrated manufacturing is approached . Other roles that the CAM system can take over on the way to total CIM include computer-aided process planning , cost estimation , part programming , inventory control , MRP ( material requirements planning ) and JIT ( just-in-time ) implementation ( discussed below ) , automated testing and inspection , and development of work standards . // 3 . Computer-Aided Process Planning Computer-aided process planning is one of the most vital links between the design and manufacturing functions in a CIM factory . By definition , process planning is the sequencing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the design specifications . It is often thought of as something of an art form and can be very time-consuming . For this reason , and because of its connection with many factory functions , CAPP is an important and far-reaching concept . CAPP , and process planning in general , addresses the following questions : 1 . What raw materials should we start with ? 2 . What machines should be used ? 3 . In what order should the parts be machined ? 4 . In what order should the components be assembled ? In a noncomputerized process planning system , these questions are answered by manufacturing personnel and are documented on a route sheet . This sheet is duplicated and distributed to all stations involved , resulting in a large paper trail . CAPP improves the process in two ways : it reduces the paperwork , and it removes the human element from the planning process . The first task is a simple matter of information technology and data distribution , but the second is much more difficult . Development of the process plan is a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is created that will result in the finished product . It is a process that requires intelligence and , as such , can not be automated without a great deal of effort . There are two common approaches to developing a CAPP system that can generate a process plan : the derivative approach and the generative approach . A derivative CAPP system , also called a retrieval system or a variant system , seeks to create a new process plan out of an old one . It takes as input the CAD drawing of the new part and analyzes the part in terms of general shape , types of features , and complexity . This analysis results in a group technology ( GT ) code number that describes the part in a general , featureoriented manner . The CAPP system then searches the company 's part data base for a previous part with a similar GT code . When an old part is found with a sufficiently similar code , the route sheet for that part is retrieved and modified into a route sheet for the new part . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data base for future use . If no closely matching GT code can be found , the CAPP system either signals for an operator to develop the process plan by hand , or defaults to a generative mode . A generative CAPP system takes a " from the ground up " approach , generating a process plan completely from scratch . This system is an example of an artificial intelligence program and is usually created using expert system // programming techniques ( see Chapter 4 ) . Basically , the program contains " rules " that relate product features to process steps . For example , one rule may state that if the overall shape of the part is cylindrical , the process plan should start with round bar stock , cut to the proper length . If it is cylindrical with varying diameters , a lathe step will be included . If it is cylindrical with holes , a drill press will be used , and so on . Regardless of the type of CAPP system used , a route sheet is prepared , stored , and routed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to each recipient on paper in a less integrated factory or sent electronically in a more fully CIM-oriented factory . The use of a CAPP system has other advantages besides reducing paperwork and saving time . One is standardization . Two human process planners might come up with two different process plans for the same part , but a CAPP system will always provide the same plan . This can standardize factory operations and reduce time wasted in refixturing and retooling . Further , two similar parts will generally have similar process plans , which might not be the case with manual process planners . Finally , since CAPP necessarily runs on a computer , an interface is automatically provided to other parts of the CIM operation of the factory . The CAPP system is easily interfaced to an MRP system , inventory system , customer billing system , and so forth . 4 . CIM in General This subsection has discussed some of the elements that are integrated into a CIM system . Although they have been defined separately , it should be remembered that none of the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , connected system . The remaining elements to be discussed are the dissemination and use of the information developed by the CAD , CAM , and CAPP elements by the rest of the factory . Two topics in this area are discussed : MRP and JIT control . However , before diving into discussions of these high-level concepts , there is one more element of the CIM factory that must be covered : the machines that will do the actual production work . These are discussed in the next section . 5 . Flexible Manufacturing Cells and Systems Flexible manufacturing is the concept of using capital equipment such as machine tools , robots , and controllers to produce a variety of products whose mix is not known in advance . In a factory that produces large volumes of a small number of parts , there is no need for flexible manufacturing . A factory that produces a variety of parts , but in well-defined and preplanned proportions , has no need to adapt to changing demand . These types of fac34 Chapter 3 tories are still well advised to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material in this section . However , many industries do not have the luxury of advance warning of their production requirements . In the quest for ever-decreasing lot sizes , setup times , and inventories , flexibility of production capability is becoming increasingly attractive to more and more companies . What is this flexibility , and how is it acheived ? The flexibility we are discussing involves the ability to produce 1 . A variety of products 2 . A variety of product mixes 3 . New parts with minimal lead time This implies that we do not know , in detail , what we will be called upon to produce , or how much , or when . Our production equipment must be flexible enough to perform whatever tasks are necessary , within reason , to meet the demands . This flexibility is achieved by the use of a flexible manufacturing system , which is a group of equipment , generally under computer control , that can produce a variety of products with a small setup time between products . Ideally , the system should be able to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it profitably . A term often used to describe this type of system is flexible manufacturing cell ( FMC ) . The difference between a flexible manufacturing cell and a flexible manufacturing system is largely arbitrary , but in general a system is thought of as a larger and more flexible installation than a cell . A flexible manufacturing cell usually contains a small number of machine tools ( say , a lathe , a mill , a band saw , and a robot ) under the direct control of one computer and designed to produce one part " family " of very similar parts . The term flexible manufacturing system ( FMS ) generally designates a larger collection of machine tools , along with material handlers , some sort of storage and retrieval system , several controllers , and a central supervisory computer , all geared toward the production of several different part families . Possible components of an FMS or an FMC include all the equipment used in any type of manufacturing . However , the most useful items to be included are the multifunction and programmable versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers , and turret lathes , along with the appropriate tool-changing devices . Because FMSs are often run with minimal supervision , automated inspection equipment ? such as automated coordinate measuring machines ? are often included as well . The functions of an FMS need not be limited to machining . They may also include tooling for sheet-metal forming , injection molding , forging , and joining processes . Larger systems require an extensive amount of materialManufacturing // handling equipment , such as conveyors and AGVs for moving material from one machine to another and robots for loading and unloading parts to and from each machine . Another possible component of an FMS is one or more human operators . While FMS usually implies a high level of automation , that is not a requirement . A skilled human operator who is familiar with the process plans of all types of parts to be produced can replace the material-handling equipment and greatly reduce the cost of the FMS . How is an FMS designed ? There is an optimal selection of machine tools and material handlers for any one specific application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guess of the overall product mix required . Upon determining that an FMS is the appropriate approach , it is necessary to select the equipment , arrange it in the most efficient manner , and be able to control it for maximum throughput and machine utilization . The first step in FMS design , therefore , is to identify the requirements for the system as specifically as possible . Since the system , by definition , will be flexible , these requirements will naturally be ranges and approximations rather than exact numbers . The questions to ask are : 1 . How many different products will be produced and how different will they be ? For our purpose , these are really the same question ; they seek to determine the amount of flexibility needed in the FMS . The general rule is that efficiency decreases with increasing flexibility . When the need for flexibility becomes too large , the loss of efficiency makes the FMS approach infeasible . On the other hand , if very little flexibility is needed , a dedicated manufacturing setup will be more efficient than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-off is that the FMS implementation is most attractive when a moderate amount of flexibility is required . If only one or two very similar parts are to be produced , the FMS approach should be abandoned in favor of a less flexible but more efficient installation . If there are a large number of widely varying products , a sufficiently flexible single system will end up with poorly utilized equipment . In this case , the operations would be best broken up into separate cells , some flexible , some dedicated , as circumstances dictate . Well then , what amount of flexibility is appropriate for FMS operation ? How many products should there be , and how different should they be , to require sufficient but not excessive flexibility ? Unfortunately , there is no general rule , since the actual numbers depend upon the nature of the industry in question . 2 . What volume of production is required ? This must be estimated from the product mix we intend to produce , the market conditions that we expect to prevail , and the level of production that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a particularly strong influence on whether or not to // use FMS , but it must be known to determine capacities and amounts of equipment to purchase . 3 . What is the anticipated product mix ? Of the different products the FMS will produce , approximately what percentage of the production volume will be devoted to each product ? This question can not be answered with precision . If it could , we would have no need for flexibility at all ; we want the flexibility so that we can respond to changes in demand for each product . But we must decide what range of variation is likely for each product , so that we will be prepared to handle it . Once these questions are addressed to the best of our knowledge , detailed specifications for the cell or system can begin . There is no general rule for FMS design , as distinct from design of any other production system , with regard to selection and layout of the equipment . The best approach is to use standard industrial engineering techniques , as presented in Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various alternatives should then be evaluated using simulation techniques ( also discussed in Chapter 5 ) to determine which best meets the requirements for throughput , machine utilization , efficiency , and adaptability to the range of product mixes that are anticipated . Once the FMS has been designed , specified , and built , it must be controlled . This is generally accomplished by one or more computers , operating at several levels of supervision . In the case of an FMC , with a small number of machines in one localized area , a single dedicated computer of midrange capability is usually sufficient to handle all control tasks . A larger FMS , composed of several cells and an extensive material-handling system will require an additional level of computer supervision and will usually need several autonomous controlling computers with one supervisory mainframe to keep track of them all . Whatever the arrangement of computer architecture , there are several levels of control function that must be met. 1 . Shop floor control . This level is necessary only for a large FMS and is responsible for keeping track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . It is usually performed by a mainframe computer with connections to each of the individual cell controller computers . It tells each cell what to produce , when , and how many . It controls the AGVs and conveyors and keeps track of the parts and raw materials in the automated storage and retrieval systems . It uses an optimization procedure to allocate tasks for maximum throughput of the system as a whole . It also keeps track of the performance of the individual cells and may include some artificial intelligence programs for adapting to changing conditions and improving performance . It will probably be connected to the company 's financial and business records , as well as to the CAD system . // 2 . Cell control . In the case of an FMC , this is the top level of control . In the larger scale FMS , this level is directly below the shop floor control . It is responsible for the operation of an individual cell or unit in the FMS , such as a storage and retrieval system or a cell of machines dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually implemented with CNC technology , a mini- or supermicrocomputer that can control several machines at once , in real time . It stores the process plans for each part made at the cell , as well as instructions for automated inspection if the cell has that capability . It also keeps statistics on the performance of the machines within the cell and maintains control charts based on the results of the automated inspection . 3 . Machine control . Each machine within a cell must be individually controlled . In a less automated system , these would be the functions carried out by a programmable logic controller ( PLC ) or NC unit . In an FMS , these devices may still be used , under the supervision of the cell control computer . Alternatively , a PC or other microcomputer may be used to link each machine to the cell controller , or the cell controller may be linked to each machine directly . Either way , it is a separate function , with the tasks of running the part programs and monitoring the machine performance , detecting tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might arise . C. Material Requirements Planning At this point , our factory is in pretty good shape . We have designed our parts for maximum manufacturing efficiency . We have used CAD to generate part files , CAM to send the part files to the factory , and CAPP to decide how best to produce and assemble the products . We have specified , purchased , arranged , and connected our manufacturing equipment in the most efficient manner . We are only one step away from running a neat , tidy , profitable , and efficient factory : we have to tell every person and every machine what to do ! We have to fire the starter 's gun and make sure that all our carefully planned activities occur at the correct times , in the correct order . Material requirements planning , or MRP , is one part of this execution and control function , and a very important part . MRP ensures that we have the materials we need and that we have them on time . It sounds simple , and in principle it is . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more products , each composed of hundreds or more components , this becomes a gargantuan task . Fortunately , it is all based on simple math and bookkeeping , and so can be explained , if not implemented , with a minimum of difficulty . An MRP system is based on one simple equation : what we need = what we want ? what we have // In other words , we must calculate how many units of raw material and components are necessary to manufacture our planned production volume , and subtract from that the number of units that we have , or will have , in inventory . This leaves us with the number of units that must be acquired . It sounds simple , but there are complicating circumstances that must be considered . One is magnitude : we may have a large number of products , composed of a large number of components . Another is timing : we must order components early enough for them to arrive on time , and we must order raw material early enough to produce the components we need on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need an entire year 's worth of material all at once , but will want to spread it out on a period-by-period basis . We will examine each of these items individually . 1 . Master Production Schedule Our MRP system is driven by a master production schedule , which is an output from our strategic manufacturing planning functions . Someone has decided how many units of each of our products we must have , ready to deliver , for each period of time . The methods employed to develop this master production schedule were discussed earlier in this chapter and come from sales and demand forecasts , firm commitments from customers , desired inventory levels , and so forth . A master production schedule is a two-dimensional matrix : it expresses the quantity desired for each product during each time period . The size of a time period varies from one company and industry to another , but is typically a week , month , or quarter . Daily or yearly time periods are possible , but are rarely practical . In the case of a monthly period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of our products for each month . These production periods are also known as " time buckets . " This raises the question , how many time periods or buckets should we include in our schedule ? This also varies from company to company , but should be as large as each company finds feasible . The schedule can always be updated if demands should change . The length of the master production schedule is called the planning horizon . To summarize , our master production schedule is a two-dimensional matrix , with each product we sell listed down the left side and each time period within our planning horizon listed across the top ( see Figure 4 ) . These numbers are used to derive the " what we want " values in the MRP equation given above . 2 . Bill of Materials File Another input to our MRP system is called the bill of materials ( BOM ) file . This is used to calculate the details of the " what we want " values in our MRP // equation . While the master production schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of materials tells us what we want to produce it from . There is a separate BOM file for each product in our catalog . In a well-automated factory , a BOM file can be produced automatically from the CAD data base for each product . Each file contains a hierarchical list of each subassembly in the product , each subsubassembly in the subassembly , and so on , down to each individual component . A typical BOM format is called the indented bill of material list , as shown in Figure 5. // The level of automation and data integration in a factory greatly influences the ease with which the BOM is integrated into the MRP system . In a completely manual system , large amounts of bookkeeping must be performed by hand , by armies of clerks , data entry personnel , and bookkeeping personnel . As a complete CIM system is approached , more and more steps in the information-processing function can be automated , resulting in a handsoff computer-driven MRP system . 3 . Inventory Record File The other input needed for the MRP equation is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which of the components and raw materials are already in inventory ? More precisely , how many of each item will be on hand , and not already spoken for , at the time period when it will be needed ? Time phasing must be followed scrupulously at this stage of the MRP calculations . This information is stored and reported in the inventory record file . This file maintains the information of how many of each item of raw material , component , subassembly , and final product will be on hand for each time period throughout the planning horizon . The format varies from one installation to another , but there are generally lines for total inventory , projected inventory , inventory already committed , and inventory available for use in future production . Again , the inventory records can be completely manual , highly computerized , or anywhere in between . The MRP system can function with any type of inventory system , but is most easily performed with a computerized inventory system . 4 . Timing We now have the information we need about what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to calculate what we need to acquire . The only other concern is when we need to have the parts on hand . A fail-safe answer to this question would be : get it now ! If we order all parts that we expect to need as soon as we realize we will need them , we will rarely be caught short . True enough , but then we are faced with unnecessary carrying costs , not to mention vastly increased storage space needs . This approach also encourages sloppy production planning techniques , as we shall see in the next section on JIT planning . We will be in better shape if we plan to receive our required materials at the beginning of the time period in which they will be needed . The final piece of information we now need is lead times . When we place an order for a quantity of raw material or components , there is some time lag before we take delivery . This is called ordering lead time . We must order our required materials at a time that is earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , than the time at which we must have it . // Similarly , when we have all the materials needed to manufacture a product , it is not instantly machined , fabricated , assembled , tested , and packaged . All these steps take time , and the time will vary from one product to another . This time is known as manufacturing lead time and is calculated from the process plan . Therefore , the time at which we must have the materials is earlier , by an amount of time equal to our manufacturing lead time , than the time at which we must deliver it . Once all these items of information have been considered , we will be able to calculate exactly when to place the orders for each of the materials we want delivered to our factory . If nothing goes wrong , each item will arrive precisely in time to allow us to meet our master production schedule . The overall relationships between the various segments of the MRP system are shown in Figure 6 . Of course , it is not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production schedule and " explodes " it , in accordance with the // BOM , into a huge list of raw materials . It also spreads the schedule out over time to accommodate the various lead times involved in ordering and manufacturing each component and subassembly . The result is a highly scattered and fragmented list of items and order times . A certain amount of consolidation is often in order . One concept to consider is common use items . As mentioned under the " Design for Manufacturing " subsection , we have attempted to design our products with common or " preferred " parts whenever possible . If we have , our MRP file may specify many separate orders for the same item . Obviously , these should be consolidated into one order if they all occur within the same period . Another consideration comes from standard inventory theory concepts such as economic order quantity ( EOQ ) . If our MRP system tells us that we need to order 9,000 units of some item in a given month , but we get a volume discount for ordering 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightly increased carrying cost . A further issue to consider is uncertainty . Is manufacturing lead time really a constant ? How about ordering lead time ? How crucial is each part to the overall process plan ? When there is some doubt about the time required to finish a production plan , it is sometimes advisable to use safety lead times , a cushion of time to make up for possible slippages in the schedule . A similar concept is safety stock : excess inventory to account for uncertainty in demand , potential quality problems , or uncertain yield . 5 . MRP-II One other concept worthy of note here is the newer version of MRP known as MRP-II , or manufacturing resource planning . This is basically an expanded version of material requirements planning , with extra functions integrated into the planning procedure to convert it from a tactical tool to a strategic one . To convert an MRP system to an MRP-II system , it is generally linked with the financial plans of the company and often is interfaced to a computer simulation , as discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its overall functions and structure are not as well defined as the standard MRP concept and are beyond the scope of this discussion . D. Just-in-Time There is much talk today about the just-in-time approach to manufacturing planning and control . It is often hailed as revolutionary and as the only competitive way to run a factory in the modern economic environment . Few people , though , really understand what a JIT system means or what it includes . While a JIT system can revolutionize the operation of a factory , it is not based on any new concepts . JIT must be implemented with all the traditional // techniques that most production people have known for years . What it changes is the philosophy that is used to run the factory , not the tools . The tools are used with a new attitude , which enables them to be used much more efficiently . The best way to understand how JIT works is to imagine learning how to swim . One way is to take lessons in a pool , getting instructions from an expert teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and honing your skills until you are ready to attempt a swim in water that is over your head . Another way is to go out in a boat to the middle of a lake and jump overboard : you will learn to swim , or you will drown . JIT is like jumping overboard . It does not include any new skills that you did not already know , nor does it require any . Rather , it puts you in a position where you must use what you know , and in the most efficient possible manner , or disaster will befall . This sounds dangerous . It is ! Many would-be JIT practitioners have fallen on their corporate faces before getting their JIT system working properly , but when everything comes together , they have an efficient , high-quality manufacturing process . The trick , then , is to throw yourself into the manufacturing lake and put yourself into a position where the necessary skills and techniques will come into use to save your economic life . 1 . The Lake The " lake , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a lack of inventory . The JIT philosophy sees inventory as an unnecessary evil : it artificially buoys up an operation that would otherwise sink and hides the problems that would otherwise be apparent . All efforts , therefore , are focused toward the reduction of inventory , in terms of both finished products and work in process . This reduction has immediate benefits in the reduction of carrying cost and storage space and in an increase in responsiveness . But these are minor benefits compared to the other changes that will result . The attempt to survive without the crutch of excess inventory improves quality , reliability , throughput , and profits . How is inventory a crutch ? It allows mistakes to go unnoticed . Suppose we are to deliver 100 units of a product at a specific time . If we have only 100 units , they must all be good . If 2 percent are defective , we will be two units short in our delivery . We have drowned instead of swimming . But we have detected the defectives , can trace them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we had maintained an extra 100 units in inventory , our shipping department would have " borrowed " the extra two it needed . The defects would not have disrupted our operation , but we also would not be alerted to the need for improvement . // This principle also holds for work-in-process inventory at each step of the manufacturing process . Each department consumes a little more material , and uses a little more labor , than should be necessary . Finding all these little inefficiencies is virtually impossible , because they are spread out over the entire operation . No single problem is large enough to stick out , but the cumulative effect is that we are carrying a large amount of waste in the system , in terms of materials , effort , and time , without ever knowing it is there . 2 . The Toss How do we toss ourselves into the lake ? The key is a switch from a " push " - based system to a " pull " - based system . Each step in the manufacturing process must be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for the upstream department to perform its function . This system is based upon demand , rather than supply . When department N + 1 requires 25 units of work from department N , department N will produce it . If each part requires two components , department N will " pull " 50 units of components from department N ? 1 ( see Figure 7 ) . How is this an improvement ? For one thing , no station is doing more than is necessary . Department N is not allowed to produce a 26th unit , so it does not . It can not make a few extra " just in case " there is a problem . ( Just-intime is often called the antidote to the just-in-case philosophy . ) Another forced improvement is quality . If department N must deliver 25 units , and is not allowed to produce a 26th unit , all 25 had better be good ! Quality has been forced . This does not mean that 100 percent quality will occur automatically ; it just means that if it does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to shipping , billing , and accounts receivable . The problem will be noticed , and steps will be taken ! JIT does not specify what those steps should be ; that is up to the individual process engineers and will generally be standard techniques that have been known for years . 3 . The Implementation A JIT system is implemented by putting this demand-based system into operation . This requires redesign of many of the process planning procedures . All the changes detailed below lead to a decrease in the inventory level of finished goods and work in process and to an increase in overall quality . The following techniques must be implemented : a . Reduction of Lot Size . The ideal lot size for a JIT system is one . Sometimes this is just not feasible , but often it is . In any event , the lot size should be reduced as much as possible , and policies should be instituted to constantly attempt to reduce it further , until a lot size of one is reached . Under no circumstances should a lot size exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent value is a good starting point for a new JIT system , // and it should be constantly lowered . What if a department produces less than 10 items per day ? Is a lot size of less than one feasible ? Certainly , since any large , complex unit will be composed of subassemblies or produced by a number of steps . These should be broken down and implemented as sep arate lots . b . Elimination of Discrete Batches . Production should be thought of as a continuous flow , rather than as batches of a discrete number of units . This is literally true when lot sizes have been reduced to one and is approximated when lots are small enough to be completed in less than an hour . The smooth flow of products allows any level of demand to be met without waste and // allows smaller and smaller orders to be produced profitably . This also helps customized orders to become more feasible . c . Production of Mixed Products Simultaneously . It should be possible to produce all products at one time , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strictly possible only when lot sizes have been reduced to one , but is reasonably approachable when the 10 percent rule has been followed . A mixed mode of production also allows orders of any size or specialty to be met profitably , with minimal waste of effort or production . d . Reduction of Setup Times . This is the key to many of the above steps . One of the main things that causes large lot sizes is the overhead of setting up equipment for a specific production process . If setup time is zero , profitable lot size , by definition , is one . As long as setup time is sufficiently small , though , sufficiently small batches will result . Often , setup time leads to a trade-off in the production engineering phase of process design : Is it worth investing in more expensive equipment to reduce the setup time of a specific item ? If lot sizes are to be large , the more expensive flexible equipment is rarely justified . If lot sizes must be small , it generally is not worthwhile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures and programmable machinery . In a JIT system , our primary goal is to reduce lot size . Therefore : get the equipment . The payoff will come in the benefits to be reaped farther down the road . e . Commitment to " Zero Defects " Goal . Again , we have a situation where a common trade-off must be resolved in light of our new philosophy . Suppose we have two options on our purchase of production equipment : one system of machinery is fairly inexpensive , but will produce product that is defective 2 percent of the time . The other brand of machinery costs twice as much , but will yield good product 99.99 percent of the time . Is the better equipment worthwhile ? Suppose the cheaper machine costs us $5 per day in wasted materials and energy , but is cheaper by $100,000 . In a shortsighted sense , the waste is justified . But the JIT philosophy says it is not . Allowing the waste into the system would destroy the demand-based " pull " system , would create excess work in process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the entire procedure . Quality improvement puts our system into an upward spiral of further improvements . As quality improves , our batch sizes decrease , our inventory decreases , subtler problems become apparent , and our control over the process increases . True JIT is more closely approached , and further quality improvements follow . f Increased Worker Understanding . Workers in the factory must understand more of the production process than just one workstation or department . There are two reasons for this . First , personnel are working on a pull // system : each station will function only when the next station downstream requests a batch . When this job is done , what will the workers do ? In an ideal situation , they move to any other station that has work to be done . It is the workstations and their specific functions that must wait for a pull , not the employees . The more tasks an employee is able to perform , the more fully utilized that person will be . He or she will also see the overall operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the JIT philosophy of continually striving for improvement . The best source of ideas for process improvement are the employees who are doing the work . The more stations an employee can operate , and the broader his or her view is of the operations at large , the more useful his or her insights and suggestions will be . One of the main reasons for reducing inventory was to make problems more evident . The other side of the coin is to enable the workers to see the problems when they surface . g . Commitment by Management . The importance of this element can not be overstressed . JIT can not be implemented in one department at a time ; it must follow the production process of at least one product line from beginning to end . This will require a fairly high level of management agreement right from the start . The first thing that will happen when a product line is converted to JIT control is that it will fall flat on its face . Production schedules will not be met , deadlines will be blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfied . This can not be helped ! It is the only way that problems and inefficiencies will be found ! It is the essence of the JIT process . The second thing that will happen is that management will want to pull the plug on the whole idea . They will see that the state of the company is going from reasonably good to horrible , and they will want to give up . This must not be allowed . Management must be made to understand , right from the start , that this is an expected , indeed necessary , phase of the JIT conversion . The third thing that will happen is that the process will improve again . As problems are found and corrected , production will begin to catch up with the required schedule . Process efficiency and product quality will vastly exceed the pre-JIT levels . Management will see that its commitment was justified . 4 . The Pull How is this pull system instituted ? Two things must be done . The master production schedule must be adapted to put the initial pull into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given a way to pull on the department upstream from itself . // The master production schedule was discussed in the previous subsection on material requirements planning . This schedule is used to give our production system the initial tug to get things started . The production schedule is generally written in terms of numbers of each product to be delivered each week , month , quarter , or some other convenient period of time . These demands must be subdivided to daily production requirements according to some scheme . For example , a monthly schedule may specify that 1,000 units of product A be produced in a given month . If that month has 20 work days , we could merely say that production each day should be 50 units . We could then do the same with the other products in the schedule . On the other hand , we could take the opportunity to add some intelligence to our production schedule . If item A is a hotter seller than our other products , we may wish to produce the entire month 's worth as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the rest of the month . We may wish to keep production of certain products in step with each other , or to delay a specific product to the end of the month . Whatever product blend we wish to require on each day , our " continuous production mode " allows us to do it . Whatever method we choose to employ , we will generate a production requirement for each production day on the calendar . This requirement is sent to the last station in the production process for each product . The final station might be inspection , assembly , packaging , or whatever our process plan has specified . JIT does not require us to change the process plan , only how it is followed . Also , remember that there is no allowance for safety stock or safety lead time ; we are in a no-defects , zero-inventory mode , and we must stick with it . Now we have injected a one-day pull into the production system . We will do the same each day , as planned when we divided up the monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , we are free to alter our daily schedule at will , should our demand forecasts be updated , or if previously unanticipated orders should be received . That is another JIT advantage . Once this one-day pull is started , how is it propagated through the entire production process ? There is no requirement that this be accomplished in a specific way , and each company is free to establish whatever procedure works best for it . Some of the more popular are summarized here . a . The Verbal Method . In a small facility , there may be no need for formal procedures . Merely walking over to the upstream department or picking up the phone may be sufficient to get the message across . This is fine for small job shops and low-volume producers , but is not recommended for larger operations . b . The Floor Outline Method . A slightly less casual method is to draw an outline of the floor between each two successive departments or workstations . // ' Ibis outline should enclose an area just large enough to hold one lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws its input from within the outline . The upstream department keeps an eye on the area . When the outlined area is empty , that is the signal to go to work filling it up again . When sufficient output has been produced to fill the outline , the downstream department stops . The downstream department must understand that it is not to start work again until the area is empty . Otherwise , there will be a permanent inventory of work-in-process , and the JIT philosophy will have been violated . c . The Empty Pallet Method . A variation on the floor outline method is to use an empty pallet or container . Exactly one container exists for each interdepartmental relationship . That is , there must be one container to shuttle between departments N ? 1 and N , one to shuttle between departments N and N + 1 , and so on . The containers are sized to hold exactly one lot of the work-in-process that travels between the two departments . Department N draws its input materials from the container until it is empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The empty container is the signal for department N ? 1 to begin production again and fill it up . When full , it is sent downstream to department N. This is basically the same as the floor outline system , except that it can be used for departments that are not near each other . It is therefore more convenient for large factories with complex process plans . d . The Kanban Method . This is an even more sophisticated technique , but is still based on the same principles as the methods presented above . Instead of sending empty pallets between departments , authorization cards ( kanban in Japanese ) are sent . When a downstream department is ready for one lot of input , it sends a kanban to the previous department upstream , authorizing one batch of work . The kanban system is more flexible than the previous methods because it is based purely on exchanges of information to signal production runs , not physical entities such as pallets . The kanbans can even be electronic signals sent over a computer network . This allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate in the JIT mode . Some systems use a dual kanban approach . One type of kanban is a production signal , telling the upstream department to begin production . The other type is a transportation kanban , authorizing the movement of either an empty container to an upstream department or a full container to a downstream department . 5 . Results When a JIT system is begun , the initial result will be chaos . As stated earlier , the factory is not able to handle the new requirements and so falls flat on its // face , as surely as if a crutch had been removed . That is exactly what has happened , as the crutch of inventory has been eliminated . The final result , however , will be wholesale improvements in efficiency of the overall operation . These include : 1 . Vastly improved quality . Since there is no room for defects in a JIT system , they are necessarily eliminated or vastly reduced . 2 . Minimized inventory and storage costs . Since inventory of finished products and work in process are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . 3 . Increased equipment utilization . Since setup times must be reduced to operate in JIT mode , the equipment spends more of its time in useful production work . 4 . Minimized waste . Since there is little or no room for error in the new system , losses due to wasted material , energy , and time are eliminated as much as possible . 5 . Reduction of paperwork . Since there is no longer any significant inventory , there is no need to keep track of it . There is also no need for a central production planning facility to tell each department what it should be doing , since the pull system distributes that information as it is needed . 6 . Constant Striving Finally , remember that most JIT systems are never completely implemented : there is always room for improvement . The JIT philosophy is asymptotic . It specifies zero defects and lot sizes of one . If these are somehow attained , great ! Generally , they will only be approached . That leaves constant room for improvement , which must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error level can not be realized , the very act of trying improves the efficiency of the process . This is very important : trying to improve those two factors will improve throughput , utilization , and overall efficiency . This sounds like cheerleading , but it is not . It is the essence of the JIT philosophy . E. Economic Analysis All tactical manufacturing planning decisions have economic consequences that must be considered . Naturally , decisions are slanted toward those alternatives that maximize profits . An understanding of basic economic principles is therefore essential to sound tactical planning . The fundamental arithmetic of economic planning is known as engineering economics and focuses on the time value of money . Many excellent texts are devoted to this topic , as well as any good course in microeconomics , so we will not belabor it here . A few vital points , however , are addressed . // 1 . Time Value of Money fhe foundation of engineering economics is the idea that money has a time value : the longer you have it , the more it is worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than receiving $100 a year from now , even if there were no inflation . Why is this ? It is because money is a piece of production equipment . It can be used to produce products that can be sold for a profit . If we had a million dollars , we could buy a factory , operate it for a year , pocket the profits , and then sell the factory . If we sold it for exactly a million dollars ( no inflation and no depreciation ) , we would be back where we started , but with the money generated as profits in our pocket . We used the million dollars , indirectly , to generate more money . I f we had kept the factory for two years , we would have made more profits . If we had kept it only for six months , we would have made less profits . We can see that the longer we have use of the money ( or the equipment we can purchase with it ) , the more profits we will reap . These profits represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did we get the million dollars ? Most likely , we borrowed it from a bank . The bank did not loan it to us for nothing ; that would have been unwise . It could have used the money to buy a factory itself . So to make it worth the bank 's while to loan it to us , it requires that we pay them . The longer we keep the million dollars , the more they want us to pay . In essence , we are renting the million dollars , just as we could have rented any other piece of production equipment . When you rent money , the rent is called interest . The calculations involving interest rate are called compound interest formulas . They are not complex , but are beyond the scope of this discussion ; the reader who is unfamiliar with them is referred to the texts listed at the end of the chapter . 2 . Selection of Alternatives The task of engineering economics is to evaluate various production alternatives and determine which one gives the most advantageous time value for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initial Cost . How much money is required up front to implement a specific alternative or plan ? 2 . Interest Rate . How much " rent " will we be paying on the money that we will use to implement the plan ? 3 . Annual Cost or Benefit . What will the monetary consequences of the plan be on a yearly basis ? That is , by how much will it increase our profits ? Or , alternatively , how much will it cost us each year ? // 4 . Economic Life . How long will this plan or investment last ? How long can we expect the profits to keep coming ? When will we have to reinvest to keep our enterprise going ? 5 . Salvage Value . After the economic life of the investment has passed , will we be able to sell the used equipment for any significant amount ? 6 . After-Tax Cash Flow . How does the investment affect our income tax status ? Is the investment depreciable ? Is this the best time to implement it ? Each of these values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic analysis to be made of a candidate plan . The results of the analysis will tell if the plan is profitable and , if several alternatives are available , which is the most profitable . In terms of manufacturing planning , each of the factors listed above can be complex and can involve many subproblems . Some of these subproblems are discussed below . a . Initial Cost . This value can usually be determined fairly straightforwardly . If we are considering the purchase of a piece of production equipment ? for example , a lathe ? several vendors will probably offer acceptable items . The prices will be well defined , but may be negotiable . if a vendor will give a trade-in allowance on old equipment that we are replacing , this amount may be deducted from the cost of the new equipment in the economic analysis . Since trade-in values may vary from one vendor to another , it is important to determine the amount separately for each alternative . It is also important to consider the start-up costs associated with installing and debugging the new equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production time lost during the changeover . b . Interest Rate . The interest rate to be paid on an investment can also be determined simply , but first we must determine the actual source of the capital funding to be used . In the case of a bank loan , the interest rate will be stated explicitly . However , many capital expenses will be paid for out of a company 's cash reserves . In this case , the cost of the funds is the loss of the interest the cash is currently earning . Obviously , it would be unwise to remove funds from an investment portfolio that is yielding a 10 percent return , just to invest it in equipment that will return 5 percent . This would be justified only when the equipment is absolutely necessary to stay in business and to protect or support other , more profitable investments . Another factor to consider is variability in interest rates . When an adjustable rate loan is used to finance new equipment , a best estimate must be made of the interest prevailing in each future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic analysis . // c . Annual Cost or Benefit . The impact of an investment on annual cash flow can be difficult to determine . A new piece of machinery will affect overhead costs in terms of energy consumption , raw material use , insurance , maintenance , floor space , and work-in-process . It may also affect labor requirements , either positively or negatively . The effect on overall factory efficiency will be difficult to determine , unless the new equipment is replacing an older machine that was performing precisely the same function . Other effects on annual cash flow can be even more difficult to determine . These include such factors as product quality , customer satisfaction , corporate image , factory safety , employee satisfaction , and environmental impacts . d . Economic Life . It is also difficult to predict how long an item of equipment will continue to function . Even if equipment life could be determined accurately , there would be the problem of annual cost and benefits changing ( generally getting worse ) as the equipment ages and wears out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an item of capital equipment is rarely used to the point at which it is no longer useful . Generally , it is used only so long as keeping it is the most economical alternative . As a piece of equipment ages , its maintenance costs almost always increase . Further , the depreciation allowance eventually gets used up . At some point , it is advantageous to purchase a newer piece of machinery , even though the old one still has some life left in it . The point at which this replacement becomes the preferred alternative is very difficult to determine , especially at the beginning of the life cycle of the original equipment . The future maintenance costs are difficult to anticipate , as are the future costs of replacement equipment . The point of this discussion is that any estimate of the economic life of a capital investment must be considered to be a very rough approximation . The only exception is when you have already been through many life cycles of the same type of item and have extensive experience to draw upon . e . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine at the beginning of a machine 's life cycle . It will vary with the economic life of the equipment , the final condition of the equipment , and the prevailing economic , technological , and market conditions at the time of replacement . f . After-Tax Cash Flow . Once all the values discussed above have been estimated , as closely as they can be , an economic analysis is possible . However , this will be a before-tax analysis , which does not necessarily reflect the actual cash flow that will result . In general , money spent in the course of doing business is tax deductible , but there are several different ways of deducting it . If the items purchased will be consumed within a year , they are considered ordinary expenses . These // expenses include office supplies , rent , salaries and wages , and insurance . The costs of these items are deductible in the year that they were purchased . Other items last more than one year . These are considered capital expenses , and their costs can not be deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , computers , buildings , vehicles , and land . The costs of these capital items must be deducted over the course of several years , and each year 's deduction is called a depreciation allowance . A large number of laws and regulations spell out detailed rules for determining how many years it takes to fully depreciate each type of equipment and how much depreciation is allowed in each year . These laws are complex and tend to change from year to year . In conducting a complete economic analysis of any investment under consideration , it is necessary to calculate the tax consequences , including depreciation allowances . The net effect of taxes is to minimize both profits and losses , since payment of the taxes will remove some of the income , and depreciation allowances will return some of the expenses . These after-tax rates of return are the numbers that must be compared among the various alternatives to actually determine the most economically attractive course of action for an investment . IV . SUMMARY This chapter addressed manufacturing planning , beginning with the strategic manufacturing management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defining where a corporation wants to be in the near and long terms and how it will get there . The connection with TMA is clear ; TMA must be an integral part of the overall corporate business strategy . A strategic manufacturing plan consists of two fundamental pieces of information : strategy and tactics . Strategic planning involves assessing the internal and external worlds that affect the corporation . This is accomplished via analyses addressing areas such as the environment , competition , investment , potential , distribution , and customer base . A key consideration in strategy development is the product itself . The product must be able to fill a market void and differentiate itself from the competition . Key performance parameters are reliability , safety , and quality . It makes sense to develop a strategic manufacturing plan that optimizes these parameters to increase the probability of successful commercialization . Tactical planning involves defining the methods for guiding , supporting , and performing the actual manufacturing activity . Topical methods such as design for manufacture , computer-integrated manufacturing , material requirements planning , just in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // V.

Are they related at all ? // 4 Management Control As in any corporation , management control must be maintained and enhanced wherever possible . This does not mean overmanagement , but clear , effective , and efficient management that motivates and empowers people . This chapter first addresses the need to establish an integrated approach among various departments and people to achieve TMA , as well as ways to do this . Then , recognizing that people and departments have their own personalities , we discuss the need to establish and implement a motivational strategy that promotes a positive working environment for a// persons . The next section addresses various qualitative and quantitative engineering management tools . The last section illustrates the power and flexibility provided by expert knowledge-based systems . Expert systems are an excellent way to increase management efficiency and eliminate or reduce management and operator error . I. INTRODUCTION Management control and leadership are critical factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recognize that both control and leadership are an integral part of the whole TMA objective . TMA is not intended to be a trendy or fashionable activity that makes a grand debut and then quickly 57 // disappears , but rather a long-term commitment to continual improvement as a leading corporation . Control is demonstrated by maintaining a direct and expedient course toward corporate strategic goals and objectives . Leadership is demonstrated through the desire to ensure that products are well designed initially and then manufactured and provided to the customer without any loss of design integrity . This chapter outlines several concepts and tools to facilitate management control of TMA activities . These concepts and tools are not presented as new and innovative techniques , but as underused and very effective and efficient ways to maintain management control . H. INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT CONTROL Chapter 3 introduced many of the important elements of a manufacturing environment that are used to attain TMA . To be effective , these individual elements must work together , communicate , feed on each other 's strengths , and shore up each other 's weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management control approach . For this integrated structure to exist , management must take a very strong hand in all areas of endeavor , including engineering , manufacturing , marketing , and product assurance . Management must have a wide-ranging vision and avoid mistakes of shortsightedness or narrowness of focus . Far more than in traditional manufacturing environments , the TMA-oriented corporation must be glued together by the integrating powers of its management function . This is not to say that successful TMA requires more management than traditional organizations . In fact , the truly integrated company often has fewer layers of management and fewer people employed at each level . This is not the contradiction that it seems to be at first glance . Integration of function requires that all hands know what each of the other hands are doing , and this becomes more natural when there are fewer hands involved . A large management structure tends to specialize and lose broad focus ; a lean management structure necessitates a broad overview on the part of all participants . The motto of the TMA management structure is " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share information , responsibility , and decision making . Interdisciplinary teams must be a standard working paradigm at all levels of control . Allowing walls between various functional groups encourages a dangerous " throw it over the wall " style of interactions . In this mode , marketing will decide what product is needed , write it in a memo , and " throw it over the wall " into the design engineering department . Design will come up with what // it deems to be an acceptable product design and then will toss the blueprints over the wall to process engineering , which will come up with its vision of a good process plan . This will be lobbed over another wall to manufacturing , and so on . What the organizational walls actually do is to force a sequential or serial operation and communication structure ( see Figure la ) . This limits interactions , inhibits learning from the experiences of other groups , and generally keeps everyone 's focus entirely too local for TMA . More appropriate is a parallel operation and communication structure , in which multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time ( see Figure lb ) . Because certain functions must naturally lead into other functions with their output , complete parallel structure is not usually feasible . But the more cooperation and interaction that is possible , the stronger the entire organization . As mentioned above , an integrated management approach requires a broad focus on the manufacturing enterprise . Certain management guidelines make this philosophical strategy more concrete : // 1 . Focus on broad , rather than narrow , performance measures . Avoid judging manufacturing tactics on short-term and short-range indices of performance . These shortsighted measures include such ideas as machine utilization , labor hours per part , floor space , inventory levels , and so forth . This does not mean that these goals are bad or even unworthy ; they are quite good . But they are not proper goals for management to focus upon . More fitting goals for high-level management are competitiveness in the industry , corporate image , customer satisfaction , adaptability to changing market conditions , and other issues that provide long-term staying power in relation to competitors . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken care of , the narrow-focus measures will take care of themselves . 2 . View change as a process , not as an event or program . In keeping with a broad focus , recognize that change is the only constant in the manufacturing business , as in life . It is a mistake to look at a new production line or new organizational structure as a sudden change , dividing the old from the new in a quick , clear-cut delineation . Rather , see the gradual implementation of new techniques and equipment as a way of life that , when constantly followed , ensures constant improvement . 3 . View reliability , safety , and quality ( RSQ ) as a solution , not as a problem . Too often , management sees acceptable product functional performance as the goal and sees RSQ as an impediment to that goal . This philosophy leads to a manufacturing environment that implements only enough RSQ to avoid missing the given specifications . It also delays the concern with the RSQ of products and processes until after they have been both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little , too late , and undermines the competitive edge . The correct philosophy is to see RSQ as a primary goal , and satisfaction with meeting specifications as the problem . When all efforts are tuned toward maximizing RSQ in all respects ( including design , process , and testing ) , the best possible , most competitive output will result . 4 . Use shorter time frames than seem comfortable . Typical time frames for corporate programs are in the range of three to five years . The goals of these programs may be the implementation of a new customer service department , the complete automation of an old process , or perhaps improvement of some performance index by a given percentage . Do not be afraid to attempt the same goals in half the usual time , or even less . John Kennedy set the seemingly impossible goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s , and the goal was met . Forcing an organization to react as quickly as possible can motivate it to react as efficiently as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely wait for problems to occur , thinking that they can be fixed when they crop up . // This attitude is tempting , since it requires action only on problems that do , indeed , develop . But it is self-destructive and anti-TMA in the long run . The broad-focus approach is to develop an organizational structure that automatically senses any process that is beginning to deviate even slightly and forces a solution before it can develop into a full-fledged problem . Just-intime is an example of a preemptive approach to production control ( see Chapter 3 ) . 6 . Be willing to take risks . There is an entire world full of competitors out there , and many of them are going to be taking risks . Some of those that do will fail , and fall behind , but some of them will succeed , and leave you to fall behind . To remain competitive , you must take risks , and you must make them pay off . Refusing to take risks is like the poker player who always antes , but never sees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will never take home a pot . These philosophical concepts may help develop broadly focused viewpoints for top management to follow , but they do little to help organize a corporation that is capable of following them . The successful organization is one with the proper interlinking of functions and lack of walls to allow these concepts to be implemented . Guidelines exist for proper structure , some of which have already been discussed : 1 . Structure like a matrix , not like a pyramid . The typical organizational chart is based on a two-dimensional pyramid , with large numbers of lowlevel functions , each feeding upward to smaller and smaller levels of control . The top level is completely isolated from the lower levels , and no sideways communication is possible . To eliminate walls , this structure should be rearranged into a multidimensional matrix . The pyramid should be flattened so that there are fewer layers from the top to the bottom . The size of the bottom layer should be decreased and that of the top layer increased , so that workers are less specialized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of horizontal lines of communication , so that all functions interact appropriately in all phases of a project . This fits in with the parallel , rather than serial , structure discussed earlier . 2 . Develop interdisciplinary knowledge in all personnel . Just as manufacturing functions are integrated by computer linkages and nontraditional organizations , people must also be integrated . This should be accomplished at two levels : the level of the individual and the level of the group or department . Encourage , or even require , individual employees to learn as much as possible about other departments and their functions , responsibilities , and // problems . Publicize open positions within the company , and encourage employees to apply for them . Institute training periods for new employees or newly promoted managers that rotate them through a variety of functions . At the group level , organize multidisciplinary teams to attack problems . Draw members for key committees from a large variety of departments . Invite people to meetings from different functional areas of the company . Whenever a group is organized , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . 3 . Eliminate barriers to communication . Often , different departments have trouble communicating because of differences in vocabulary , viewpoint , or educational background . Try to standardize how information is stored and presented throughout the organization . Vocabulary can be a significant problem . Each department may have a different term for the same concept or may use the same term for different concepts . Try to root out these sources of confusion and develop a standard set of definitions . Time frames are another area where separate functions have trouble communicating . Top managers tend to think in terms of years , while sales and marketing personnel tend toward months and quarters . First-line managers think in terms of weeks and months , while workers often focus directly on individual shifts , or even hours . Although it is probably not possible to get everyone to agree upon a single unit of time , at least translate each individual piece of information into the appropriate time frame for the target audience . 4 . Avoid the " not-invented-here " ( NIH ) syndrome . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't want it , we 'll come up with our own . This attitude wastes incredible amounts of time , as each functional unit attempts to reinvent its own wheel . Try to cultivate a team attitude ; all departments and divisions are on the same side . Management not only must prevent the NIH syndrome from wasting resources within the company , it also must resist the urge itself . Evaluating and possibly enhancing ideas derived from other companies may seem repugnant , but it is essential to retaining competitiveness . 5 . Do not allow stagnated benchmarks . Posting a long-term stationary goal for a specific function can only lead to complacency and stagnation . Keep goals moving and constantly updated . Better yet , set metagoals , such as increasing the amount of improvement each month , or going longer without a defective part than the last time . III . MOTIVATION A fundamental problem in organizations is complacency . This results when people are no longer motivated to advance the well-being of the corporation // or themselves . Complacency makes it very hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be regarded as an infectious disease . If too many people catch it , it can cause a corporation to go to sleep , which can have catastrophic effects . The key to combating complacency is to motivate and empower people . If this is not possible , complacent people must be removed from the organization . The bottom line is that top corporate management is responsible for providing the leadership necessary to motivate workers to function in a state of high creativity , entrepreneuralism , and productivity . In Chapter 1 we stated that if a person is unhappy with his job , he should look for a new job . A complacent attitude may be the result of a person being too happy with his job . That is , he is happy with the status quo . An objective of effective leadership must be to motivate people not just to be happy with their jobs , but to continually look for ways to improve them and make them more rewarding both personally and for the corporation . Ideally , every person should intrinsically enjoy making an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all workers are capable of self-motivation , management generally must provide the motivational spark through a proper leadership style . The leadership style by which motivation is achieved must remain flexible to accommodate change , as necessary , so that the organization as a whole can avoid the complacency trap . This is particularly true in light of the broad range of personalities , educational backgrounds , and organizational levels contained within a corporation . A. Leadership Style Four factors are identified as being associated with effective leadership 1 . First is support , which involves making people feel worthwhile and aware of management consideration . Second is interaction facilitation , which involves fostering the development and effective use of people and establishing a good communication network . Third is goal emphasis , which involves making people aware of the goals of the organization and instilling a sense of enthusiasm for achieving these goals . Fourth is work facilitation , which involves helping people achieve the corporate goals by effectively administering , planning , and coordinating resources . These four factors are certainly important and should be employed fundamentally at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied with a perspective on the specific workers being targeted . For example , it likely that exactly the same leadership style will not be effective for workers on the production floor and workers in the corporate office . These two sets of people have different personalities and divergent corporate expectations . // It is clear that to meet corporate goals , including those that are TMA spe cific , it is important to determine the appropriate leadership style required . This must be done at the corporate level , as well as at each successive organ izational management level . In general , three variables are considered in determining the appropriate leadership style : ( 1 ) forces in the projected leader , ( 2 ) forces in the other or ganizational members , and ( 3 ) forces in the situation 2 . The best leadership style depends on management values , personality characteristics , and feel ings in various situations . Further , it depends on whether people are ready to accept responsibility , are interested in company problems , and are in tune with the corporation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vroom 's prescrip tive model of appropriate leadership style 3 . The leadership style serves as the cornerstone of the motivational strategy . The model is exercised using a decision logic that defines five alternative leadership styles , as identified below and keyed to Figure 2. 1 . Decisions are made solely by the manager based on whatever informa tion he or she possesses . Management Control 2 . Decisions are made solely by the manager , but additional information is gathered from workers . 3 . Decisions are made by the manager , but significant input is derived from workers on an individual basis . 4 . Decisions are made by the manager , but significant input is derived from workers on a group basis . 5 . Decisions are made by the manager and the workers as a group . By exercising the decision logic , the optimal management leadership style is defined . B. Organizational Psychology Organizational psychology is a broad and very interesting field . Much research has been performed and the field continues to be an attractive research area . Several prominent organizational behavior models and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for establishing corporate , divisional , and departmental motivational strategies . There are four important organizational behavior models 4 : ( 1 ) autocratic , ( 2 ) custodial , ( 3 ) supportive , and ( 4 ) collegial . The autocratic model is founded on the power base of the manager and strict compliance of the worker . It was most prevalent over eighty years ago . In the 1920s and 1930s it yielded to the custodial model , which proved more successful . This model is founded on the economic resources made available to the worker and on his or her satisfaction . The supportive model is widely accepted and predominates in many organizations . This model relies on leadership and the subsequent motivation of the worker . The collegial model requires mutual contributions from both management and the work force . The result is a firm commitment to the job at hand and to the organization . Currently , many progressive organizations use the collegial model . Some of the most widely known motivational theories include those presented by Maslow , Vroom , McGregor , and Herzberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hierarchy of needs . These consist of physiological needs , safety needs , social needs , esteem needs , and selfactualization needs . Each level of needs provides a source of motivation . Once a level is satisfied , the person is motivated to achieve the next level . Vroom defines the Expectancy , or Path-Goal , Theory . He states that motivation depends on what a person expects to receive for his or her efforts . This expectation is not limited to first-order needs such successful task completion , but includes second-order needs to which the first-order needs might lead ( for example , a pay raise ) . McGregor defines the famous Theory X and Theory Y notions . Theory X states that workers are lazy and will work only to the extent that their work // is instrumental to getting rewards . Theory Y , on the other hand , states that workers are not lazy but are self-motivated to set and achieve their own goals , which are generally consistent with the goals of the corporation . Herzberg defines the Motivation-Hygiene Theory . This theory states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set includes needs related to the job context : salary , working conditions , supervisory policies , and so forth . Peo ple are never satisfied by these factors , but are merely neutral . Their ab sence leaves people dissatisfied . The second set includes needs related to the content of the job : challenge , the need to use one 's full capacities , the need to be resourceful , and so on . The absence of these needs leaves people neutral , and their presence makes people satisfied . There are many more motivational and organizational behavior theories . Those identified here are only a sample of some of the more widely known . The reader is encouraged to explore this area of psychological research . One point should be obvious : no one theory provides all the solutions for all pos sible situations . Corporate cultures are complex phenomena and require a motivational strategy based on a hybrid of the numerous theoretical ap proaches defined . C. Strategic Motivation Model The nature of most organizational activities allows them to be depicted by a work path to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ExpecManagement // fancy Theory 4 . From this baseline framework , other theoretical ideas fit easily around Vroom 's notion ( see Figure 3 ) . Together , these ideas form a strategic motivation model . As shown in the figure , the basic project path and ultimate goal are functions of what is expected to be accomplished and the value of the accomplishment . Once an organizational activity is initiated , individual responses are based on ability , effort , and role perceptions . An intrinsic need to complete the activity successfully exists within the organizational team members . To foster this need throughout the activity 's duration , a supportive and collegial condition is defined that provides the greatest opportunity for creativity in attaining the end goal . Of course , the primary goal is successful completion . Derived from attainment of this goal is monetary compensation , as well as self-esteem and , ultimately , self-actualization . This strategic motivation model is intended to provide the most suitable environment for the organizational members it affects . It is designed to emphasize both individual and group creativity to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE TOOLS Throughout the daily operations of a manufacturing organization , there are a multitude of management decisions being made in conjunction with many ongoing activities . This is true for corporations that are working for TMA , as well as for corporations that are not striving for excellence . It is imperative that informed decisions be made and that decisions be in accordance with a defined strategic theme . To ensure that this is the case , it is essential that formal project management exist as part of the corporate culture . The key to successful project management is up-front planning . For a given project , the activity sequence , requirements , and major milestones ( for example , proof-of-concept and technology transfer ) are defined and integrated into a basic project management plan . Various qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques are then applied to adjust the plan as necessary . The result is a plan that reflects the optimal approach to achieving the end goal(s) or objective(s) in support of ' hMA . The fundamental objective of management discipline is to enhance the benefit-cost-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , there is a danger that little or no coordination will occur among all the participating groups . There is nothing worse than thinking a project is completed , only to find that fundamental elements of the project slipped through the cracks or that the completed elements fail to fit together . For example , consider a product development project . It is known that successful commercialization depends on the product meeting or exceeding its design performance goals , including reliability , safety , and quality . Su Chapter 4 pose that the product , despite having undergone a successful development program , lacked commercial feasibility due to a lack of some fundamental performance characteristics required by the market . Somebody failed to get marketing involved to determine exactly what the targeted customer wanted . The preparation of a project management plan that identified all tasks and communication interfaces would have eliminated , or greatly reduced , the risk of such an error . Sound project management optimizes the overall effectiveness of a project in regard to its constituent activities . With this approach , one minimizes the risks associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximizes their contribution to effectiveness . Project management also ensures that the proper activities are planned , that the activities are properly timed , that adequate resources ( e.g. , personnel , test items , test facilities , funding ) are available , and that no unnecessary or redundant activities are conducted . As a minimum , a project activity schedule should be developed . This involves defining the major project tasks and subtasks that will be performed . Also , a timeline and milestones are defined for each task . Figure 4 illustrates a candidate form for documenting this information . Typically , the effectiveness of a project management plan is optimized with respect to estimated cost and time . This enables rational choices to be made with respect to overall project content and structure based on a returnon-investment approach . There are many techniques available to aid optimal management . Some of these include : ? Networking ? Linear programming ? Inventory , production , and scheduling ? Econometrics , forecasting , and simulation ? Integer programming ? Dynamic programming ? Stochastic programming ? Nonlinear programming ? Game theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations All these techniques have their place in practice . Their common objective is to help in making the best , or optimal , decision , The top two items in the list are frequently used by industry and are discussed in further detail in the following subsections . // A. Project Management Networking A good tool for defining and guiding the project management plan is the use of a networking technique 12 . Networking is an enhanced graphical application of the program evaluation review technique ( PERT ) and the critical path method . The network provides a view of the interactions and interconnections of various project activity time constituents . It also provides a powerful tool for identifying and recognizing relationships among interdependent activities . This is particularly important because completing projects on time and within budget constraints is often difficult at best . The fact that certain ac-tivities must be completed before others can be started complicates matters . Therefore , the ability to deal effectively with the interdependency among activities provides a great advantage in achieving success . A network itself consists of a series of ovals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the completion of activities and attainment of a project milestone . The nodes themselves contain several pieces of information . These // include ( 1 ) the activity reference number , ( 2 ) the earliest start time , ( 3 ) the latest start time , ( 4 ) the earliest finish time , ( 5 ) the latest start time , and ( 6 ) the activity duration time . Figure 5 illustrates the components of a network node . The lines between each node represent the activity in progress . The length of each line has no correlation to the actual duration time of the activity and is merely a convenience for the user . The network illustrates how all the tasks of the project are tied together . The saying " a picture is worth a thousand words " certainly applies to proj ect management networks . The network identifies which activities must be performed before others , which occur in parallel , and which are unrelated . In addition , the time required to complete individual activities , as well as the overall project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network is to define the activities required in the project and to establish the proper order of precedence . Er rors or omissions at this step will produce a faulty management plan and possibly have a catastrophic effect on the project at some point . Proper project management networking involves identifying each activity , its description , its immediate predecessors , its estimated duration , and the resources available . The immediate predecessors of an activity are those ac tivities that must be completed before the start of the activity in question . The estimated duration time is defined by discussion with the various per-sons participating in the project . Typically , both the overall time and the resources available are well-defined project constraints and reflect corporate priorities . As an example of project management networking , consider a project to conduct a design verification test for a piece of hardware that is part of an overall system . The following test activities are defined as essential parts of the corresponding network diagram presented in Figure 6 : Test unit fabrication Special test equipment development and fabrication Test procedure preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct and monitoring Test data compilation Failure reporting , analysis , and corrective action Test facility use Test data analysis and reporting The network depicts the activities in their order of precedence . Note in the diagram that some of the project activities occur simultaneously , as would be expected . Once the project manager develops a network diagram , it is then filled out by estimating the time required for each activity . For all network dia grams , the earliest and latest start and finish times are defined to determine the critical path 13 and , subsequently , the total calendar project time re quired . The earliest start time ( EST ) is the earliest time an activity can begin , when all preceding activities are completed as rapidly as possible . The earliest finish time ( EFT ) for each activity is the EST plus the activity time . When two or more parallel activities are immediate predecessors to another activity , the EST for the activity is the largest of the EFTs of its predecessors . The EST and EFT are defined by starting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test activity . The latest finish time ( LFT ) is the scheduled time when the test program must be completed . This time is fixed independently of the network diagram // and , typically , corresponds to market introduction factors . The latest start time ( LST ) is the latest time at which an activity call be started if the test program schedule is to be maintained . The LST is LFT minus the activity time . These times are defined by starting with the final activity and working backward through the network . To determine the LFT for an activity that has two or more parallel successors , the smallest LST of its successors is selected . The EST and EFT times are developed by a forward pass through the networks . Identification of the LSTs and LFTs is obtained by a backward pass through the networks . The total slack is the difference between the two start times or the two finish times ( these times are the same for each test activity ) . All activities along the critical path have the same amount of slack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the activities . The critical path activities are crucial to the on-time completion of the test program . These activities receive the greatest amount of management attention . In some cases , it may be found that the critical path is too long and must be shortened . To do this , two basic approaches are used . The first is the strategic approach . This consists of questioning the defined order of precedence of activities , particularly those on the critical path . It may be possible to make arrangements to complete some activities in a manner that removes them from the critical path ( i.e. , in parallel with some other activity ) . The second is the tactical approach . This consists of determining if an increase in or acceleration of funding resources reduces the time of certain activities in the critical path . Initiating the paid working of overtime is an example of this . This approach requires a trade-off between project time and cost . B. Optimization Modeling As alluded to in the previous subsection , decisions are typically made in light of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Most frequently , constraints are a function of time and money . To make the best decision , it is necessary to balance , or trade off , project variables ( e.g. , time and money ) . Constrained optimization modeling ( COM ) is used to make management decisions that achieve the best possible results , within given restrictions . The whole area of making optimal decisions is encompassed in the field of management science . One of the most popular management-science tools used for COMs is linear programming . Linear-programming-based COMs are used in defense , health , transportation , energy planning , and resource allocation . In purely private-sector applications , uses include long-term and short-term scheduling of activities . Long-term planning activities include topics such as capital budgeting , plant location , marketing strategies , and investment strategies . Short-term planManagement // ping activities include production and work-force scheduling , inventory management , and machine scheduling . In all applications , the objective is to make optimal decisions that maximize some desired outcome . The trick for each application is to satisfy the defined set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note the continual reference to the " optimal solution . " A COM provides a solution that is called the optimal , or best possible , answer . Remember that these optimal solutions are produced relative to a mathematical problem posed by a model . Therefore , the optimal solution is only as good as the model defined to described the problem . Keep in mind that " optimality " is a theoretical concept , as opposed to a real-world concept . Although it is advantageous to have quantitative data to support and guide decisions , this alone should not form the basis for decisions . Management and engineering intuition play vital roles in making sound , well-rounded decisions . Likewise , COMs are of great help in making final decisions , particularly in identifying the numerous variables involved in making a specific decision . However , the solutions generated must not be used in a vacuum that excludes intuition . 1 . Linear Programming In structuring a COM , one must identify all the mathematical variables required in making the decision . The more complex the model , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also makes the model 's solutions more accurate and credible . The bottom line is that models which realistically describe a situation are most apt to provide the best answers . Let 's look at the structure of a COM solved by linear programming . Every COM consists of an objective function , decision variables , constraints , and parameters . The objective function describes a decision function . To derive an optimal solution , the objective function must be either maximized or minimized relative to a set of constraints . Making up the objective function are the decision variables . The decision variables represent actions or activities to be undertaken at various levels . Any selection of numerical values for the decision variables indirectly assigns values to the constraint functions . The COM requires that each of these constraint function values satisfy a condition expressed by a mathematical inequality or equality . The information serving as limiting values are the parameters . There are five key steps in defining a COM 14 : 1 . Express each constraint in writing , noting whether the constraint is a requirement ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( ) , or exact ( of the form = ) . 2 . Express the objective ( i.e. , maximize or minimize something ) in writing . // 3 . Identify the decision variables . 4 . Express each constraint in terms of decision variables . 5 . Express the objective function in terms of decision variables . In structuring the COM it is important not to read more into a problem than precisely what is known . Linear-programming-based COMs can rapidly become very complex . Such problems are conveniently solved using a computer to arrive at the optimal solution . ( Numerous commercial software programs are available . ) It is possible , however , to solve simple linear programming models manually . The simplest COMs are composed of two decision variables . A simple COM allows a graphical solution and enhances the conceptual visualization of a particular management problem . Graphical solutions provide key advantages in evaluating different problems . One sees what happens visually by adjusting the constraints . This might include adding a constraint to a problem , tightening or relaxing a constraint , unintentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model in the wrong way . Linear programming uses the fact that equations of the form ax + by c are linear inequalities . This means that all constraints or restrictions in the COM are linear inequalities . When the above equation is changed to ax + by = c , it becomes a linear equation . In general , equations in which one side is of the form ax + by and the other side is a variable value that depends on the choice of x and y are called linear functions . Knowing that the graph of any linear equation is a straight line , we can draw this line merely by locating two points in the plane that lie on the graph . This is accomplished by finding the points of the line that intersects the x and y coordinate axes . To do this , a zero value is substituted for x to find the value of they coordinate , and vice versa . This gives a set of two points ? that is , ( 0 , y ) and ( x , 0 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly for each constraint . The graph of all constraints together defines a domain , or feasible region , which isolates all the possible combination of variables satisfying the objective function ( see Figure 7 ) . The domain for the COM is determined by the relevant side of each constraint 's equality line . This relevant side is determined by selecting a trial point ( e.g. , 0 , 0 ) that is not on the constraint line . If the trial point satisfies the original inequality , then the linear line plotted and all points on the same side of the line as the trial point satisfy the inequality . If the trial point does not satisfy the original inequality , then the linear line and all points not on the same side as the trial point satisfy the inequality . Depending on whether one desires to maximize or minimize the objective function , the optimal variables are identified as the extreme points of the domain . These points are represented by a corner point of the domain ; that is , a point where two edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a linear function and its graph passes through the extreme points of the domain for the optimal solution . To sum up , linear programming optimization problems involving two unknowns are solved by three fundamental steps : Construct a geometric representation of the domain , or a feasible solu tion set of the optimization model . Identify the extreme points of the domain . Calculate the value of the objective function satisfying the criterion for maximization or minimization . Keep in mind that optimization problems involving only two variables are unique . It becomes difficult , if not impossible , to solve a COM involving several variables through geometric methods . A popular alternative to geo metric solution methods is the Simplex Method . // The Simplex Method is a technique of matrix manipulation that automati cally finds pairs of linear equations with graphs that intersect at extreme points , solves for variable values that satisfy all constraint equations , and calculates the values of linear functions for the variable values found . In addition , the Simplex Method identifies the variable value combinations that solve the linear programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine all the extreme points to do this . The most important feature of this method is that it works for linear pro gramming problems in any number of unknowns , not just two . Also , it is well suited to computer implementation in solving large linear programming problems . As with all decision techniques , however , there are some appli cations not suited for the Simplex Method . Nonetheless , most COM-based linear programming problems arising in practice can be solved using this method . 2 . COM Example Consider the need to establish the most effective product development test program plan . To do this it is necessary to find the optimal solution through geometric representation of a linear-programming-based COM . A graphical method is used because the natural segmentation of a product development test structure ( i.e. , laboratory testing and field testing ) allows for two-dimen sional analysis . It is desired to determine the maximum effectiveness levels for laboratory testing and field testing based on various project constraints . We define the following objective function : maximize 70EL + 30EF where EL is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fectiveness level for field testing . The objective function is derived based on a maximum overall program effectiveness limit of 100 percent . We also define the following constraints : where the decision variables are defined as follows : E is the minimum ac ceptable effectiveness level defined for the overall project ( see Table 1 ) and the 70 and 30 represent effectiveness contributory weights ; tL is the estimated laboratory test time required , tF is the estimated field test time required , and T is the actual test program time available ; and cL is the estimated lab-oratory testing cost , cF is the estimated field testing cost , and C is the actual R/D test program funding available . // The COM defined states that the problem is to make the value of the objective function as large as possible , provided that the constraints are satisfied . The value of the objective function is measured in effectiveness ( i.e. , 0 to 100 ) . Constraint 1 defines the nonnegativity conditions . Constraint 2 defines the upper bound of laboratory and field testing effectiveness . Constraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower acceptable bound of overall test program effectiveness and the baseline test segment effectiveness weights . Constraint 4 defines the test segment effectiveness level possible based on the maximum test program time available and the program time identified for each test segment . Finally , constraint 5 defines the test segment effectiveness level possible based on the test program funding available and the estimated cost of each test segment . The model requires that each of these constraint values satisfies the condition expressed by the mathematical inequalities defined . The established constraints are solved and plotted to define a feasible region from which the optimal corner is found and , consequently , to define the optimal effectiveness levels for laboratory and field testing . Figure 8 illustrates a possible feasible region formed by a constraint set . The optimal corner determined by the constraint set is the one that maximizes the objective function defined previously . V. EXPERT SYSTEMS One of the newest and most powerful tools available for management control of manufacturing is the expert system . In fact , this tool is important enough to devote a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // incorporated into the previous section . The power and flexibility of the ex-pert system concept , however , sets it apart from the algorithmic tools discussed previously . A. Expert System Definition An obvious question is " What is an expert system ? " Many definitions ex ist , and not all are completely compatible . For TMA purposes , an expert system is defined as a computer program that relies on ( 1 ) knowledge and ( 2 ) reasoning to heuristically arrive at a decision or perform a task that is usually accomplished by a human expert . It is important to recognize that this definition sets expert systems apart from the many other types of computer programs . Several concepts are im plicit in our definition , each of which leads to a specific strength of the expert system approach . // ? Knowledge , rather than data , is used . Data is raw information , not directly usable . As a consequence , it is not immediately obvious which pieces of data are appropriate to a specific application . Knowledge tends to be verbal rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The machine is broken , " whereas a piece of data would be : " X = 5.25 . " The use of knowledge rather than data makes the expert system easier to build , understand , update , adapt , and maintain . ? Knowledge and reasoning abilities are independent functions of the system . In a standard computer program , the procedures to be followed ; the rules , case statements , and control algorithms ; and the information concerning the task at hand are all bound together in one large system of programs and subprograms . To update the system , one needs to search through piles of control code to find the specific line of code that contains the information sought . In an expert system , the knowledge is stored in individual chunks ( called ru/es and facts ) , without regard for the order in which they are to be used or the purposes they serve . The control and use of this knowledge are governed by an inference engine that has the ability to reason on any problem , as long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on heuristics rather than algorithms . A heuristic can be described as an imprecise procedure for solving a problem . Within this very imprecision lies the power of the heuristic approach : since a heuristic is loosely defined , it has a broader range of application and is a more robust approach . An algorithm will probably give a more correct answer to a problem than will a heuristic , but the heuristic will give a good enough answer far more often and will succeed in situations where the algorithm would break down and give no solution at all . ? The expert system emulates the thought process of a human expert . Humans tend to use heuristic approaches rather than algorithmic approaches , and their heuristics evolve over time . This is why a human expert is better than a novice at many tasks : he or she has built up a good system of heuristics to solve a variety of problems in a specific domain . Similarly , expert systems are most effective in tasks that require specific knowledge and procedures , rather than general reasoning . From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of the expert system approach . First , expert systems are better than ordinary computer programs : ? Since they use heuristics , they are more robust and can find workable solutions to problems more often than can algorithmic programs . ? They are more easily updated , since knowledge is maintained separately from the reasoning mechanism . A new fact or rule can be inserted into the knowledge base easily , and the reasoning mechanism will use it when appropriate . // ? They explain their solutions . As we shall see , expert systems easily can be endowed with a " justification " feature , so that they not only provide solutions to problems , but can explain their reasoning if asked . Second , expert systems are better than human experts : ? They do n't get sick , go on strike , or retire . ? They are easily duplicated . A human expert requires years of expensive training . To clone an expert system , the only cost is for an additional computer and a copy of the software ( or for an additional terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system can explain its reasoning , whereas a human expert often has difficulty justifying decisions that he or she knows " just feel right . " B. Expert Systems vs . Artificial Intelligence The concept of expert systems arose out of the artificial intelligence ( AI ) research community . It began as a tool for understanding the mechanisms of human cognition and for emulating human thought processes . With the development of expert systems that had the ability to perform certain types of reasoning , it became clear that these symptoms could be used to perform useful tasks . A new segment of the AI community began to concentrate on developing expert systems to be used for their own ability , rather than as a research tool . New programming techniques were developed , and the expert system moved out of the realm of AI and into the world of computer science and programming technology , creating a new niche now known as knowledge engineering . As with many other AI concepts , as soon as expert systems became useful tools with profitable applications , they ceased to be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems for specific tasks is more know ledge engineering than AI work . But fundamentally , expert systems still conform to the goals and concepts of the AI community . C. Expert System Structure The structure of any expert system is based on four key elements , each of which has an analog in the human expert . The elements are the knowledge base , the inference engine , the user interface , and the explanation facility ( see Figure 9 ) . The knowledge base is where the information resides in the expert system ; it varies from one application to the next . Two expert systems , for two different purposes , may be identical in all respects except for the knowledge base . // The knowledge base can be thought of as the " education " of the expert system . Its analog in a human expert is the years of training , experience , and practice that a person accumulates on the way to becoming an expert . Like the expertise of a human expert , the knowledge base is the most difficult ele ment to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts : the rule base and the fact base . The rule base consists of a collection of rules , often of the form " IF ( ( condition THEN ( ( conclusion . " These rules are completely gen eral , often include variables , and form the basis for decision making in all possible scenarios of the domain in which the system is an expert . The fact base , by contrast , contains simple statements about the condi tion of the world for the current problem at hand . Generally , the fact base will change as the expert system is reasoning about a problem , whereas the rule base will change only if the knowledge engineer in charge decides that is should be updated . Rules and facts together lead to new facts , in much the way that a syllogism functions in formal logic . For example , the rule " IF X is a man THEN X is mortal , " combined with the fact " Socrates is a man , " leads to the new fact " Socrates is mortal , " which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference engine is the part of the expert system that performs the reasoning . It can be compared to the raw intelligence of a human expert . As with humans , different types of inference engines exhibit different levels of intelligence , but the same inference engine could be combined with many different knowledge bases to reason about many different domains of expertise . Many different forms of inference engines exist , but all are designed to perform the same task : examine current facts and use available rules to generate new facts . One type of inference is called discovery . In this mode , all rules and all facts are used to generate all possible new facts , without regard to their possible relevance . In another type of inference , called determination , the use of the knowledge is more goal directed . A specific " hypothetical " fact is suggested , and only those rules and facts are used that are necessary to determine if the hypothetical fact is true or false . The technique used for this reasoning is called chaining and both forward and backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Figure 10 ) . Each fact in the knowledge base is compared against the IF part of each rule . If the conditions in the IF section are satisfied , the rule is " fired , " which means that the inference engine will execute the THEN part , by creating the facts it specifies . These new facts are also compared to the IF portion of // each rule , and so on , until no new firings are possible . At this point , all pos-sible facts have been " discovered . " Backward chaining ( see Figure 11 ) reverses this process , and it is used in determination . The expert system is asked to determine whether a candidate " fact " is true . The inference engine compares this fact to the THEN portion of each rule . If a rule is found that can generate the candidate fact , this rule 's IF portion becomes the new candidate . The inference engine then proceeds to attempt to prove the validity of the facts in the rule 's IF portion . Eventually , the hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and rules , thus determining that the original candidate fact is not true . The user interface enables the expert system to communicate with a user . The form of the interface used depends on the intended audience of the expert system , and many systems contain a variety of user interfaces . The user may be well versed in the area of expertise in question and be able to respond to queries with little prompting or may be a complete novice in need of constant hand-holding . The user may be a computer expert who is comfortable with a crude interface or may be a neophyte who would appreciate complete user-friendliness with graphics , menus , and copious on-line help . Whatever the form , the user interface must allow for the following com-munications between expert system and user : // ? The user must tell the expert system what the task is . ? The expert system must tell the user what facts it requires . ? The user must tell the expert system the current state of the world as it relates to the situation in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user . ? If asked , the expert system must be able to explain its decisions to the user . The explanation facility is the element that allows the expert system to justify its conclusions . It is an important facility for several reasons : ? Users may not trust the expert system and may wish to be reassured that the conclusions are valid . ? Users may wish to learn from the expertise that the expert system possesses , rather than follow its suggestions blindly . ? The developer of the expert system may want to ensure that the knowledge base is properly codified . The development of the explanation facility parallels the development of the rule base . Frequently , each rule in the knowledge base will include , in addition to an IF and a THEN clause , a WHY clause . This clause is used when the user requests an explanation of a conclusion . D. Expert System Development Now that a basic definition of an expert system has been established , we will discuss the hows and whys of applying expert system technology to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed us to develop an expert system to help make decisions in our inventory control area . We now face the task of going through the proper steps to construct a working expert system . 1 . The Expert System Domain The first task is to properly define our domain . In general , our domain for this job is inventory control . But we must be more specific . Will the job include keeping track of current inventory , or just making decisions ? Will it calculate optimal order quantities ? Will it allow for back orders ? Will it provide answers to specific questions only , or will it volunteer information that the user may not think to request ? We must decide what will be included before starting any development . What defines an appropriate domain for an expert system ? The domain must not be too broad . Handling the accounting for an entire corporation would be a Herculean task . A good rule of thumb is : Can one or two experienced people perform the task satisfactorily ? If not , we may need to downsize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , either . Tasks that require " common sense " are rarely appropriate for expert system implementation . One reason for this is that even a human expert will have trouble explaining his or her reasons for making a decision . If something " just makes sense , " we have very little basis for coding a rule in our knowledge base . A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that the task should be solvable with expertise that has been learned over the course of time ? in other words , experience . If a novice is just as good at completing a task as an experienced expert , then we will probably have trouble developing an expert system to perform the task . 2 . The Domain Expert Once our domain has been specified and scoped appropriately , a domain expert is required . This is the source of the knowledge that will go into the knowledge base . Frequently , the domain expert is an actual person , such as the person who has been performing the task in the past . If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will make him or her obsolete . While this has occasionally happened , a domain expert rarely becomes expendable after being immortalized in an expert system . For one thing , software requires as much maintenance as hardware ; as company policy changes , the knowledge base must be updated . Furthermore , any large software project will require years of debugging and optimizing . In addition , the system will probably be implemented in several phases of gradually increasing complexity , and many years will pass before all tasks are automated . As a final incentive to the balking human expert , there is the " mental wrench " effect . Often , the human domain expert who was used to generate the knowledge base becomes the user of the system in the future . The human expert finds that the expert system helps to magnify his or her own abilities within the domain . It frees him or her from the tedious parts of the job , allowing him or her to concentrate on the more creative aspects . The expert can set up complex " what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions in a fraction of the time formerly required . He or she may even learn more about the domain through the experience of coding knowledge into a formal system . 3 . The Knowledge Engineer In the expert system development project , there must be someone who is well versed in the theory and mechanics of expert system technology . This person is referred to as a knowledge engineer . There is currently a great shortage of knowledge engineers in industry , and many companies are forced to hire consultants or attempt to create their own knowledge engineers from existing personnel . // The knowledge engineer is the bridge between the human expert and the expert system . While this person generally needs no prior knowledge of the domain area , he or she should be able to grasp and understand the principal concepts quickly . He or she must be enough of a psychologist to help the domain expert formalize his or her own knowledge , and must be enough of a computer scientist to code that knowledge into the form needed by the inference engine . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . With the development of newer and better shells ( discussed below ) , the knowledge engineer 's task is becoming easier . For many small-scale expert systems , the knowledge engineer and the domain expert are the same person . This is particularly true in technological domains , where the domain expert is already familiar with computing and programming techniques . 4 . The Expert System Shell In the " old days " of the 1960s and 1970s , the only expert system tools available were string-processing computer languages such as LISP and Prolog . These required large amounts of programming to accomplish even relatively minor tasks and ran on expensive mainframe computers . Nowadays , a multitude of expert system " shells " exist on the market , with prices ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars down to several hundred dollars . A shell takes care of the busywork that must be done to keep track of rules , facts , variables , and so forth . Shells are usually written in a standard computer language such as C or LISP and give the user a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . The shell provides all elements of the expert system except the knowledge base . It includes an inference engine that can perform forward or backward chaining , or both ; it includes some sort of ready-made user interface , often with a built-in menu structure and graphics interface ; it includes an explanation facility that can communicate the " why " fields of rules to the user ; and it often includes a " development environment " that provides basic tools for the knowledge engineer to aid in construction of the knowledge base . This could include a text editor , an interactive debugging facility , and sometimes an " intuition facility , " which can extract rules from decision tables . 5 . The Development Process The very first step in the expert system development process , which must be completed before actual work begins , is the task of assembling the essential elements listed above . The domain of the system must be properly scoped , with a task that is well-defined , sufficiently focused , and capable of solution by the use of expertise . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person who can solve the task , a collection of well-documented case studies , or perManagement // haps a good textbook . A knowledge engineer , or someone willing to learn to become one , must be hired or appointed to the task . Finally , the appropriate development platform must be acquired , probably an expert system shell with some sort of development environment . a . Step 1 ? Structural Design . After these preliminaries are taken care of , the first step in the process is to design the structure of the expert system . The issues to address are such questions as : What will be the system inputs ? What will be the outputs ? What data is available ? What kinds of rules will be used ? What will be the principal variables ? What will be the intermediate variables ? Will there be different classes of rules ? What will be the classes ? Answering these questions correctly is not essential . There will be opportunities to revise them . Most expert systems are developed organically , in that they grow gradually from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best to make reasonable decisions on the structure of the system and then see how well they work before revising them , if necessary . It is also wise to focus on a subset of the domain at this point and to code some rules in the chosen structure . If these rules seem to make sense , the structure can be considered usable . b . Step 2 ? Knowledge Acquisition . At this point , a well-defined structure for the expert system knowledge has been developed . We have decided what sort of rules are needed , what they should do , and how they should interact . The next step is to extract the knowledge for the complete domain from the domain expert . Attempting this step before the first step would be a mistake . The insights gained from the structural design phase help guide the knowledge acquisition process . This is especially important if the domain expert has trouble explaining his or her methodology . When presented with rule structures , the expert can usually " fill in the blanks " with less trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development process . It can be slow and tedious and can require many iterations and reinterviews with the domain expert . But take care that the step is performed completely and accurately . The quality of the finished expert system depends almost completely on the accuracy , precision , and completeness of the knowledge acquired . c . Step 3 ? Coding . The next step is to convert the knowledge collected in Step 2 into the structure developed in Step 1 . This should be fairly straightforward if the previous steps were handled conscientiously . This is also the step in which the expert system shell 's development environment comes in most handy . The task difficulty can vary by orders of magnitude between a well-organized development system and a poor one . // d . Step 4 ? Validation . After the knowledge is coded , it must be tested . Use the expert system from the perspective of the end user , assuming the level of understanding that he or she will have of the domain . Run case studies , and compare the solutions offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the examples that were used to develop the rules in the first place . If these do not yield the expected solutions , there is a coding error . Once these examples have been validated , try some new examples that the system has not seen before . Compare its answers with what the domain expert would do in the same situation . In this way , the scope of the system can be determined . Ideally , the system should be able to solve as many types of problems as are likely to occur within the realm of its domain . e . Step 5 ? Growth . As stated earlier , the best expert systems will grow organically , getting larger and more complete with time . Try following the first four steps on some significant subset of the knowledge domain first , and see how well the system works . If it performs adequately , add more and more capability . If not , do not be afraid to throw it away and start from scratch with a new structural design for the knowledge . The insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much better . Also , be prepared never to put the project completely to bed . As time passes , new knowledge is created . The domain will evolve as product lines are updated , company policies change , and organizational goals are reevaluated . Occasionally , go through the knowledge base and weed out old rules that never fire anymore ( some shells provide a mechanism for tracking rule usage ) . Proper attention to software maintenance will prevent the expert system from becoming just one more piece of code that used to serve a useful purpose but now collects electronic dust in some musty corner of your disk pack .

Colton 5 System Definition All manufacturing systems must be designed with robustness and efficiency in mind . This means that the system must fulfill a set of comprehensive and detailed state-of-the-art design requirements . It must also achieve this in a manner that is not overly complex and cumbersome . This chapter addresses key topical areas that are considered when defining an efficient and robust manufacturing system . These areas are addressed in four sections entitled plant layout , material handling , automation , and simulation . I. INTRODUCTION In any major undertaking , no great structure is built without first laying a firm foundation . For our task of attaining TMA , this translates to the solid base of a well-defined operating environment .

Without a sound basic structure , will all parts smoothly interacting , striving toward TMA may become moot . This chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at basic management and organizational functions typical of a modern industrial engineering curriculum , plus innovations that industry - 95 // is currently adopting . While exploring this chapter , keep in mind the hierarchy involved in the manufacturing-based corporation : manufacturing system , subsystem , equipment , module , part . II . PLANT LAYOUT A system is fundamentally composed of various equipment . This may include equipment for machining , assembly , and material handling , as well as storage , loading docks , repair facilities , computers , and personnel offices . Where are these to be located ? Plant layout or , in broader terms , facilities design , enables us to answer this question using analytical and design techniques aimed at maximizing efficient organization and interaction between various assets . We are looking for more than a floor plan . There must also be an adequate power supply ; lines of communication for both voice and data ; and , most importantly , room to grow and adapt to inevitable changes in the future . Many techniques used in facility planning involve minimizing necessary evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate economical production , decreasing distances to be traveled by material inprocess to save time and energy , and lowering the inventory cost of material tied up in production . A layout that allows fewer workers to attend to a greater number of tasks results in labor savings . A sample list of items to minimize includes : 1 . Investment in equipment 2 . Production time 3 . Material handling 4 . Work-in-process 5 . Floor space 6 . Variation in equipment 7 . Inflexibility 8 . Labor 9 . Employee inconvenience , discomfort , and danger A. Plant Layout Analysis Now that we know the major goal(s) of plant layout design , we need to address the fundamental question : How do we arrive at the layout that achieves those goals ? Many techniques exist , both new and old , which all follow one of two basic schemes : 1 . Select a number of candidate layouts . Analyze each layout according to some grading method . Select the layout with the highest score . // 2 . Define a list of goals , constraints , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout using some optimization technique . These two basic schemes are referred to as the analytic and synthetic methods of plant layout . We shall begin by discussing some of the analytic techniques available . 1 . The From-To Chart The From-To chart , also called a travel chart , is a matrix that tracks flow between the various locations in a plant 1 . Each activity location ( machine , storage center , entry or exit point , etc. ) is listed across the top row of the chart and down the first column of the chart . Each element in the interior of the chart lists some fact concerning the relationship between the corresponding row and column locations ( see Figure 1 ) . One use of a From-To chart is to list distances . An element in row 4 and column 2 would show the distance from location 4 to location 2 . Naturally , the diagonal would have all zeros , and the chart would be symmetrical about this diagonal . Another From-To chart could be used to tabulate traffic volume . The numbers in the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each // location to each other location . In this application , of course , there would not necessarily be diagonal symmetry . Combining these two charts , the distance From-To and the traffic From-To , gives the total material handling burden of the proposed layout . Slight changes in the layout can be documented easily by altering one row and one column . In this way , many candidate layouts can be compared . 2 . The REL Chart Another analytic tool is the REL , or activity relation , chart 2 . This tech-nique is more subjective than the From-To chart and is useful for considering the more qualitative influences , as well as distance and traffic volume . The REL chart uses a closeness rating instead of a numerical score for each loca-tion pair ( see Figure 2 ) . Unlike the From-To chart , which listed facts about a specific layout , the REL chart is a method for expressing desired distance relationships . The closeness rating for each pair of locations is filled in based on a qualitative judgment of how important it is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each other . The standard ratings are // 0 ? Ordinary closeness OK U Unimportant X = Undesirable These ratings are selected intuitively , based on the subjective judgement of the plant layout engineer . Often , a reason code is listed as well , indicating the rationale for the closeness rating . Typical reason codes might be sequence of work flow ; sharing of records , personnel , or equipment ; similarity of function ; or ease of supervision . Undesirable ratings may arise between noisy operations and those that need quiet surroundings , or particularly dirty or sooty operations and those that require a clean environment . 3 . Space-Relationship Diagram and Block Plan We are now ready to start constructing some candidate layouts and evaluating them . The REL chart is our starting point for generating the candidates , and the From-To chart will enable us to judge them . The space-relationship diagram is the first step . This diagram combines two sources of information : our REL chart and our space requirements . For each activity listed in the REL chart , we must calculate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anticipated production volume , time standards , and machine capacities . Next , a square is drawn on a piece of paper for each activity . The size of each square is proportional to the area needed for that activity , and this area is listed in the square , along with the activity number ( see Figure 3 ) . Each square is connected to each of the other squares with a line . The type of line used is based on the closeness rating assigned in the REL chart : An A pair is connected by a quadruple line , an E pair by a triple line , an I pair by a double line , an 0 pair by a single line , and a U pair by no line at all . Activity pairs with an X rating are connected by a zigzag line . This space-relationship diagram is the tool for generating the candidate layouts . Think of the lines connecting each activity as attractive forces . The more lines between two blocks , the stronger the attraction , like so many tightly stretched rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought of as repulsive forces . The next step is to try to assemble the activities into a block plan . Using your imagination , let the attractive forces bring the activities as close together as the relationship lines indicate . Think of the process as piecing together a jigsaw puzzle with rubber bands connecting the pieces . The final shape should approximate the shape of the plant or building that will house the activities . A typical block plan is shown in Figure 4 . Naturally , many block plans are possible from any one given space-relationship diagram . Try to generate as many reasonable plans as possible . The // // more candidates that are generated , the greater the probability that the best possible plan is among them . When you have sufficient candidate plans , the From-To chart can be used to evaluate them . The traffic volume From-To chart will be the same for each candidate , but the distance chart will not . Measure the distances for each pair of activities in each candidate and construct the appropriate distance chart . By combining this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate can be given a score for material handling burden . A simple final step would be merely to select the candidate with the lowest material handling score , but this can sometimes lead to undesirable results . It is better to select the best three or four candidates and scrutinize each closely . Are the closeness relationships implemented as desired ? Are the A pairs and X pairs situated as desired ? It is possible , especially in complex systems , for one or two important relationships to be sacrificed in favor of many small improvements in the less important relationships . This results in a better numerical score , but lets a weakness slip into the design . Use sound engineering judgment to select the final winner from the top three or four contenders , based on overall adherence to closeness ratings and any other subjective considerations not programmed into the rating scheme . B. Plant Layout Synthesis The preceding subsection focused on analysis of candidate layouts , with only minimal effort directed at the generation of those candidates . This is a tried and true method of plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With large , complex facilities , however , the method of creating these candidates becomes more important . Synthesis of candidate layouts requires many complex decisions to be made as each function or activity is placed into a layout . Consequently , computer methods are often used . Many programs for plant layout exist , three of the most popular being CORELAP 4 , ALDEP 5 , and CRAFT 6 . Some programs employ a generative approach , building up each candidate layout from scratch , while other use a derivative approach , which continually modifies an existing layout , making incremental improvements at each step . Some programs are capable of using either approach or a combination of the two . Although different programs use different methods of generating layouts , they all have certain functions in common . Most of them require as input the REL chart , as described in the preceding section . They also require a grading scale , which translates the codes in the REL chart to a score for each candidate layout . Some programs assume a constant grading scale , others allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be told how much area is required for each department and what is the size and shape of the available facility . Some programs can handle multiple floors at one time , and some allow the user to fix certain activities or departments in specific locations before synthesis begins . Most generative programs begin by selecting one activity from the REL chart . The method of selecting the first activity varies from one program to another , but is usually based on some function of the REL chart that allows the greatest flexibility in subsequent selections . This activity is placed in the layout , and the REL chart is searched again for an appropriate second activity . Again , each program uses its own criteria for selection of the order of placement , based on some function of the REL chart and the grading scale . Each successive activity is placed in the layout at a location that will minimize or maximize some program-specific function . The program generates a large number of possible layouts , giving each a score based on the grading scale . The best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program then attempts to do better . Some programs will start over with a different first activity . Others will go into a derivative mode and attempt to make improvements on the benchmark , using various internal functions . Finally , after several iterations , the program will report its latest and greatest layout . One then must decide if this layout meets all the nonnumeric requirements that were not programmed into the analysis . Generally , one also has the option to supply a different grading scale or a modified REL chart to see if a preferable layout results . As always , one should take into account past layout experience and engineering intuition in making the final decision , and not take any computer program 's recommendation as gospel . III . MATERIAL HANDLING In the previous section , we saw some techniques for laying out the facilities in a manufacturing plant . These techniques were based on several principles , one of the most important being minimization of the material handling burden . Is material handling cost worth worrying about ? Absolutely ? especially in a TMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up to or even beyond one-half of total manufacturing cost . Furthermore , in many applications , material handling is inextricably linked with other manufacturing elements . Conveyors and transfer mechanisms in assembly lines , part feeders and orienters , and robotic manipulation equipment are examples of devices that handle raw material and work in process at the same time that they are being converted to finished products . What materials are handled in a manufacturing system ? Basically , everything from raw materials to work in process to finished products . Also tools , replacement parts , energy , information , and sometimes even personnel are moved by the material handling systems . // What are our goals in handling these materials ? First of all , we want them to reach the designated destination , at the proper time or earlier . They must arrive safe and undamaged , and in an economical manner . Further , we should always be aware of each item 's location while it is in transit , in case a change in plans makes it necessary to reroute . Material handling equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly automated and intelligent . In the most basic sense , labor can be considered a material handling technique : workers can trot over to a storage area and retrieve the materials they need . This material handling device has the lowest investment cost , but one of the highest unit costs . As such , it is advisable only for very low production rates . Next , we have human-powered equipment such as dollies and hand carts . Then come human-controlled but autopowered devices such as fork lifts and motorized carts . Hoists , gantries , and conveyors require human control only for starting and stopping at desired times . Finally , we have intelligent and automated devices such as AGVs ( automated guided vehicles ) and conveyors with feedback control . The best material handling method for each application depends on a combination of factors . Quantity of material to be handled is obviously an important consideration , from the standpoints both of how many units per day and of how many days in the production run . High material flow rates require large capacity systems , and longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated equipment . Another critical factor is flexibility . Will the handling system remain constant for a long time ? Will rerouting become necessary often ? Are changes in flow rate expected ? Naturally , greater flexibility comes at a greater cost and must be justified both by anticipated changes in material handling requirements and by enhancement of profitability resulting from the flexibility . Certain guidelines should be followed when selecting and designing the handling system . These concepts are basically common sense , but are still worth discussing briefly . The first guideline is the bee-line principle : whenever possible , use straight lines to minimize distance traveled . Of course , practical considerations may overrule this concept in many situations . Next is the pallet principle : unless we are dealing with extremely large items ( say , locomotives ) , it is a waste to plop one unit onto a conveyor . This wastes conveyor capacity , as well as loading and unloading motions . It is better to palletize parts onto a single holder , or pallet , and manipulate them as a single package . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consistent size , arrangement , and orientation . Along with the pallet principle comes the buffer principle : build buffers into the production line so that full pallet loads can accumulate before transportation becomes necessary . This not only makes palletizing more efficient , but also allows different workstations to work at slightly different rates without blocking the flow lines . // Another guideline is the minimum dead-time principle : we want to keep the material moving , not sitting around . Try to speed up the loading and unloading of parts onto and off of the handling equipment . This means not only well-designed pallets and fixtures , but also intelligent scheduling of loading and unloading operations during our overall process . The two-way principle is easily overlooked , but can double handling efficiency : never send anything back empty if you can avoid it . Use the same pallet that arrived at station n to take station n 's output to station n + 1 . Do n't send it back to station n + 1 for another load ! Arrange flow so that minimal amounts of motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Finally , we have the information principle : whenever possible , integrate the information about the material into the flow with the material . Rather than saving a list of part numbers and their associated pallet numbers in a computer file for later retrieval by a downstream station , print the part num-bers onto the parts or pallet itself . Bar code printers and readers , or even less sophisticated methods for low volume , make this possible . A. Material Handling Equations The relationships describing various quantities in material handling systems are fairly simple . One basic concept is the rate of flow , Rf usually expressed in parts per minute . For a one-way conveyor or other handling system , it is given by where Lf is the length of the forward ( full ) part of the route and Lr is the length of the return ( empty ) part of the route . Including a return portion L r makes this equation applicable to recirculating types of systems , such as belt conveyors . The total number of parts in the system , N , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per pallet , Vc is the flow velocity ( feet per minute ) , Sc is the spacing between pallets ( feet ) , and T , is the loading time at each end ( minutes ) . A material handling system also has a capacity , or number of parts that can be accumulated in it . This can be thought of as a temporary storage of work-in-process . Letting nc be the number of carriers ( pallets ) in the system , then // One other important relationship should be noted here : the relationship between travel time and loading/unloading time . If TL is time to load a pallet and T , is time to unload a pallet , then to avoid backups in the system . Note that other material handling relationships , both specific to individual systems and applicable in general to all types , are found in the literature 8 . B. Automatic Guided Vehicles The highest end of the material handling spectrum is occupied by AGVs . These devices are by far the most expensive and therefore are not applicable to all situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to large payoffs for installations that can justify their cost . AGVs are basically independent vehicles , rolling from station to station under their own power and control . Some are guided by wires or painted lines on the floor , others by dead reckoning with periodic alignment checks at known landmarks . They are generally powered by on-board batteries that last at least an eight-hour shift before needing recharging . Often they have a " safety bumper , " a large loop of some flexible material on the front surface , which will detect collisions , and stop the vehicle , before the main mass of the AGV does any damage to itself or other objects in its way . Some AGVs use optical or sonar devices for collision detection . Different control schemes can be used with AGVs . In some systems , the AGV is controlled by typed instructions entered at an on-hoard control panel . This is a simple and straightforward method , but requires large amounts of human intervention . In other systems , a decentralized control scheme is used : a station in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio frequency . Any AGV with unused load capacity can detect and answer the call and service the station . This is a useful scheme in large factories with " islands of automation , " but no centralized control of the entire floor . If a central computer is used to direct flow in the entire factory , it will generally make the decisions as to which AGV should service which stations , and when . This method offers the greatest overall efficiency , but requires extremely high levels of planning and programming . Equations to plan an AGV system are similar to those given above for any material handling system , with the addition of a traffic factor to account for // time wasted in waiting for obstacles to pass , avoiding collisions , adjusting a path , and so forth . This factor , usually somewhere between 0.8 and 1.0 , is used to reduce the number of parts per minute that could be handled by an AGV with no need to worry about traffic congestion . Naturally , the more AGV and other traffic in the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUTOMATION Automation , from the Greek words for self and moving , is one of the most common buzzwords in manufacturing today . This section looks at some of the basic concepts of automation and examines some of its strengths , limitations , and trade-offs . The word automation can be applied to all parts of the manufacturing enterprise where direct human control has been minimized or even eliminated . This includes material handling , machining , assembly , inspection , storage and retrieval , and any other tasks that are carried out in the process of converting raw materials into a useful and salable product . Automation is almost universally accepted as a good thing . The reasons for this acceptance are compelling . Productivity increases are an obvious advantage of automation , in terms of both production per hour and production per worker . Other advantages of automation are decreased unit cost , increased safety , increased product quality , reduction of work-in-process , and greater predictability of the manufacturing function . Basically , automation can be broken down into two broad classifications : hard and soft 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines that do only one thing , but do it extremely well . The automobile industry was dominated by hard automation a decade ago and still makes extensive use of it . Examples of hard automation include automatic presses and die-casting machines , automated transfer lines , and any other heavy machinery that performs the same task over and over . It is characterized by a lack of flexibility , long production runs , and high production rates . Soft automation , on the other hand , is characterized by machines that can perform a variety of tasks . Soft automation is also called flexible or programmable automation and is dominated by robots and other general-purpose , programmable devices . The idea behind flexible automation is that a single investment in equipment will pay dividends in the production of many different products and processes . One cost of this flexibility is that the tasks are sometimes performed at a lower production rate than if dedicated , singlepurpose machines were used . Which type of automation is best for a given application ? The answer to this question depends on many factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate and run length , frequency of product changes , // and future business plan . For any one given manufacturing task , it is much cheaper to acquire hard automation equipment that can perform the task than to use soft automation equipment . However , if the task becomes unnecessary , the hard automation equipment will require extensive modification , if not outright scrapping . The flexible equipment can be modified easily for a new task via software alone , with no further investment in hardware . Furthermore , the flexible equipment can be instructed to perform the new task along with the old task , as each task is needed , if a variable product mix is desired . Finally , it should be noted that the distinction between hard and soft automation is not as clear-cut as it is often made out to be . In truth , a sort of continuum exists , wherein any level of flexibility that is desired can be achieved . There are individual devices that exhibit certain degrees of flexibility , and there are entire factories that contain elements of the programmable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is selected for any specific installation should be based on the amount that is needed and anticipated . To pay for excess flexibility that will never be used would be an unwise waste of funds . A. Automation Elements All automation is based on certain types of equipment , capable of performing standard automation tasks such as material handling , assembly , inspection , and so on . Each type of equipment , with the exception of robotic devices , is available in varying degrees of programmability , and so should be considered key elements of both hard and soft automation systems . Robots and similar devices , of course , are inherently flexible and should be considered elements of soft automation only . Transfer mechanisms move a workpiece from one station to the next in an automated fashion . Several configurations exist . An in-line transfer mechanism consists of a conveyor or overhead-chain system to move the workpiece along in a more or less straight line ; a rotary mechanism is more like a turning table , around which the necessary processing stations are arranged like guests at a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small number of workstations , whereas an in-line system can accomodate as many stations as are desired merely be increasing its length . Both types can move in either a continuous or indexed fashion , depending on the types of operations to be performed at each station . Automated machining devices perform the same functions as traditional machine tools , but are directed automatically with some sort of computer control , generally CNC or DNC ( direct computer control ) ( discussed below ) . These machine tools can consist of traditional tools such as drill presses , // vertical or horizontal milling machines , lathes , presses , and the like , or more modern devices that combine several of these functions . The machines may operate on a stationary workpiece positioned by the transfer mechanism , or may have a built-in multiaxis positioning table to hold the work . With regard to the newer multipurpose machine tools , many types of configurations are available . These are often called machining centers and may have several spindles that are driven by a common motor and are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by the process plan . A typical machining center may combine a drill press , vertical and horizontal mills , and a tool holder . PLC , CNC , and DNC refer to methods of using computers to control automated machine tools . They are discussed here in order of increasing sophistication . However , keep in mind that new hardware and techniques are constantly being developed , with the result that clearly drawn distinctions among these three types of control are becoming more difficult to make . PLC stands for programmable logic controller , the original device used to control automated machine tools . A PLC is a dedicated device attached to one tool and often is supplied by the machine tool manufacturer as a part of the tool system . It is basically a digital computer that can store a sequence of operations for the tool and send the appropriate commands to the tool at the appropriate times . The input console of a PLC often consists of a collection of buttons corresponding to the standard commands for the tool . A small screen is often included so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLC bears little resemblance to a general-purpose computer , but is more of an intelligent command console with a memory . Some are equipped with disk drives so that programs may be saved , and some have serial ports allowing them to download programs from some central computer . PLCs have been popular since the late 1960s and continue to be important industrial components today . The DNC concept moves toward the use of general-purpose computers , rather than specially designed digital devices , to control machining processes . In DNC , or direct numerical control , a central computer stores the programs for a large number of machines . A DNC computer can be thought of as one large PLC , managing all the machines in a factory or part of a factory . This allows for coordination of machines and processes , as well as monitoring of overall factory activities . CNC , or computer numerical control , was a natural outgrowth of DNC that was made possible by the decrease in size and increase in power of general-purpose computers . A CNC computer controls only one machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The advantages of CNC over DNC arise from the localization of control . An engineer on the factory floor has direct access to the computer at the site of the tool . Also , // since CNC computers control a single machine , there is no need for time sharing or other resource allocations , and the complete power of the processor can be used in complex control algorithms . There is no danger of a single computer failure crippling the entire factory , as in the DNC implementation . CNC computers are usually networked to a central computer , so that there is no loss of the DNC ability to monitor all processes and keep all elements of the factory in communication with each other element . Robots , or more precisely , programmable manipulators , are the final element of manufacturing and help to pull everything together . Robots have many applications in an automated factory , including loading and unloading pallets , applying sealants and adhesives , cutting , inspection , and assembly . Perhaps the most popular current uses of robots are painting and welding . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a precisely defined trajectory can be accomplished with some type of robotic device . As with any programmable automation element , the high price of a robot must be justified through savings in manufacturing cost . Tasks that are performed many times per hour , perhaps for two or three shifts per day , are especially suitable for robots . Also , tasks performed under hazardous conditions , requiring many expensive protections and precautions for human operation , may be done much more cheaply by a robot . Several issues must be kept in mind when considering a robot for a task , based on the robot 's capabilities and the task requirements . Chief among these is accuracy : Can the robot position and orient the object to be manipulated with the required accuracy ? Related to accuracy is repeatability . Repeatability is often defined as a robot 's ability to reach the same location several times in a row , without drifting as time goes by . Another issue is resolution , the smallest increment of motion possible for the robot . Is the resolution small enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations include the load-carrying capacity , the reach of the arm , and the type of grippers ( also called end effectors ) available for the robot . Another factor is the capability of the robots controller : how programmable it is , and what kind of sensors it can be connected to . These capabilities vary greatly from one type of robot to another , and a wide variety of options are available on the market today . V. SIMULATION Assume that we have developed a tentative layout of our new manufacturing system , proposed changes to our old system , or perhaps just a new control scheme for a physically unchanged system . Before implementing our new // ideas , which could cost millions of dollars , it would be nice to have some evidence that our ideas are sound . Ideally , we would like to conduct a scalemodel experiment , a dry run of the new plan , before we commit ourselves . That is exactly what simulation allows us to do . General-purpose computerbased simulation is a programming technique that allows us to analyze systems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates of the system 's performance . The concept of random variables is crucial . In most complex systems , we can not predict the future exactly . Sales volumes , consumer demand ; breakdown times , frequency , and severity ; randomly varying production times ; and many other system variables are not known precisely beforehand . If they were known , we could develop mathematical relationships between these inputs and our system outputs , although these relationships might be extremely complex . However , with simulation techniques , we do not need the exact inputs . All we need is a mathematical expression for the distribution of the inputs . Typical distributions are 1 . Normal ? with known mean and standard deviation 2 . Exponential ? with known mean 3 . Poisson ? with known mean 4 . Triangular ? with known minimum , maximum , and mode 5 . Uniform ? with known minimum and maximum These distributions are described by fairly simple mathematical expressions and can be derived from historical data of the process in question . As long as no change is expected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the historical data can be considered an excellent prediction , over time , of the future events . These predictions become the inputs to our simulation . How do we develop our simulation ? First and foremost , we must define our system precisely . That is , we must decide exactly what parts of our factory we wish to model . We must draw a " dotted line " around the part of the factory that will be included in the model . We must scrutinize this dotted line and determine all inputs and outputs to the system . These include everything that crosses the dotted line , either in or out . We must identify material , personnel , products , energy , and information that travels in and out . Anything that happens completely inside the dotted line will become part of the internal workings of the model ; those things that cross the line are modeled as inputs and outputs . What exactly is a model ? In a general sense , a model is an abstract description of some real system . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system it models . Many types of models exist in the world , // some of which are used in computer simulation . Scale models , such as miniature trains , cars , or soldiers , are useful to architects and generals . Graphical models are useful in other situations ; a classic example of a graphical model is a road map . The two model types we will be using are math models and logical models . An example of a math model is an equation , such as F = ma . This model describes the behavior of the quantities of force , mass , and acceleration and can be used to predict future events , if the inputs are supplied correctly . Another example of a math model is a look-up table : given row and column values as inputs , the output can be looked up in the interior of a table of values . This type of model is most applicable to functions that can not be described by a simple equation . A logical model is a description of inputs and outputs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF-THEN rule could constitute a logical model . A truth table would also fit the definition of a logical model . A complex FORTRAN program , with many branching IF statements , is a large logical model of some decision process . An expert system ( see Chapter 4 ) is another example . Our system model will include both math and logical models in its attempt to mimic system behavior . It will include those portions of the system that we consider important and will describe them to a level of detail , or resolution , that we consider necessary . It will be supplied with the quantities we identify as system inputs and will return to us the system outputs . When the model has been completed , it will enable us to do four things that we could not have accomplished as easily , if at all , before : 1 . If the model can be made to perform exactly as the current system does , it can be used to EXPLAIN the real system . The math and logical models we select must be actually functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PREDICT how the system would react to a new set of inputs or to a change in the system itself . 3 . This allows us to ANALYZE the system and its performance . 4 . Iterative analysis of progressive changes to the system model allow us to DESIGN a new system , or changes to the old system , in accordance with our new goals . VI . SIMULATION EXAMPLE What does a typical simulation look like ? We can examine a simple example that contains many of the elements of a more complex situation . We will look at this model merely in logical terms and will not worry about programming or implementation . // A typical system with random variables can be demonstrated by the operation of a fast-food restaurant . Let 's assume that our restaurant has one server and that customers wait in one line to be served . This line is usually called a queue . First , we must define the state of our system . The state is a set of variables that completely , yet without redundancy , describes the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description can be derived from those that are included . Many possible state descriptions exist for any given system . For our fast-food system , the state can be described by two variables : the server status ( either busy or idle ) and the number of customers waiting in the queue , not counting the customer , if any , being served by the server . We will assume that the server works diligently at serving any waiting customers and becomes idle only when the queue is empty . Next , we must identify the ways in which the state can change . In our example , there are two ways : a new customer can arrive , or the server can finish serving a customer , who then leaves . Identifying these state-changing activities is something of an art and requires a bit of practice . Next we examine how these activities change the state . Generally , the manner in which the state changes depends not only on the activity that occurs , but also on the state of the system just before it occurs . Our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server is idle , the new customer gets immediate service . This means he or she does not get in the queue , so the queue length stays at zero . The server status , however , changes to busy . If the server had been busy when the new customer arrived , the customer would have to wait , increasing the queue length , but not affecting the server status . The other activity is the server completing service of a customer . If there are no customers in the queue , server status changes to idle . If there are customers in the queue , server status remains at busy , and queue length decreases by one . Now we have completely defined our system and identified how it will function . To set it in motion , we must supply it with some inputs . The inputs will be the arrival times of each customer and the time required for service by each customer . Each of these values will be supplied from some random distribution , supposedly derived from a study of past data concerning customer interarrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . We can program our simulation to collect whatever statistics we are interested in , as long as they are based on variables in the model . For our example , we would probably be interested in things like average time spent in the queue by the customers , average queue length , and percentage of the time that the server is idle . Now we are ready to let the simulation begin . We give it an initial state ( usually server = idle and queue = empty ) and let the program run . The proSystem // gram selects a customer arrival time from the appropriate random distribution , as well as a service time . It selects the next arrival time , and if this is sooner than the first service is completed , it increased the queue length by one . As each customer arrives and leaves , the state is noted and statistics are recorded . After sufficient simulation time has passed , we will have a full set of output statistics on the values that we requested . These outputs , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard deviations . But there is no way we could have merely calculated them from average input statistics ; the relationships , in general , will have been far too complex . What about the actual coding of this model into a computer program ? Even for the relatively simple example of the **26;1808;TOOLONG system given above , we could be faced with a large programming task . Fortunately , commercial packages are available that make this task fairly simple . Most systems are composed of basic building blocks , which tend to look the same , from the viewpoint of a model , regardless of the physical system they are based on . Simulation packages supply ready-made program chunks for each of these building blocks . The user needs only to define the blocks he or she needs , define the interconnections between them , and supply actual values for the variables . Example of these building blocks , also known as network elements are Arrival elements ? model customers , orders , workers , and soon , as they enter the system . These elements must be supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queue in the system . These elements must be supplied with an initial queue length and , possibly , with a maximum allowable queue length . Activity elements ? model an activity that takes a certain amount of time . These elements must be supplied with a duration and with how many customers can be served at the same time . Conditional elements ? allow decisions to be made in the system , based on system state . Statistical elements ? allow the program to collect statistics based on current model state . Departure elements ? model the departure of customers , orders , and so on , from the system . Other , more complex elements also exist , but these tend to vary from one simulation package to another . Each has its own strengths and weaknesses . Some are more geared toward specific situations or industries than others . Some have built-in animation and graphics packages , which can display a schematic diagram of the system model on a computer screen as it operates , allowing the user to watch customers arrive , get service , wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulation languages are SLAM II , GPSS , and SIMAN .

It defined the second major element of TMA , manufacturing system control . The system needs to be defined in a way that facilitates controllability . The manufacturing area is laid out to allow maximum efficiency . It is important that manufacturing subsystems be arranged together in a design that reduces distances , inconvenience , and inflexibility . Methods available to achieve this goal include From-To charting , REL charting , and space-relationship diagramming . Computer programs are available that expedite such analyses and allow for comparative assessment of several candidate layout designs . Material handling is always an issue . We want to move materials and workin-process through the facility cost-effectively . The best material handling method is a function of how far and how fast we want , or need , to move material . How these questions are answered guides the investment decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also enhanced through the use of automation . This technology enables repetitive tasks to be performed faster and more consistently . Automation is generally classified as either hard or soft . Soft automation is intended to be flexible . Many factors ( for example , programmability ) are involved in selecting the most cost-effective automation approach , if any , for a manufacturing system . In this age of computer technology , a major system definition advantage exists : simulation . Before we invest lots of money in a manufacturing system design that may or may not be what is desired , the candidate design(s) can be evaluated by uniquely developed or commercially available computer simulation programs . This allows the optimal system design to be selected for implementation . VIII . QUESTIONS 1 . Think of several pairs of departments in your organization that deserve an " A " closeness rating .

Consequently , controls must be integrated into the overall manufacturing process to maintain the product reliability , safety , and quality levels as close as possible to the designed-in levels . This chapter consists of three sections addressing reliability control , safety control , and quality control . The first section addressed the control of product reliability degradation , including prediction , growth , and an analysis technique to aid in identifying the optimal manufacturing system . The second section discusses several analysis methods for identifying critical product safety areas ( both product and occupational ) . The last section discusses techniques ( including statistical process control ) for controlling product quality during manufacture . I. INTRODUCTION This chapter addresses the control of product performance degradation during manufacture . Specifically , the focus is on controlling reliability , safety , and quality degradation . These three performance parameters are critical to a product 's success in the marketplace , as discussed in Chapter 3 . Admittedly , 117 // purchase cost often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the bottom line is that a product must be able to stand the test of time , and high reliability , safety , and quality are the keys to making this happen . But remember that we want to focus on controlling the degradation of these performance attributes . To do this , we must assume that a product is necessarily designed to have the inherent levels of reliability , safety , and quality that make it desirable . This in itself is generally a poor assumption . All too often , product reliability , safety , and quality are secondary issues in designing and developing new products . Also , remember that in many cases the basic design itself is flawed . How many times have all of us looked at some simple item and said " Gee whiz , this is a stupid design ! " ( You can replace " Gee whiz " at your own discretion . ) Or the product may be too difficult , or impossible , to manufacture because of its complexity or assembly requirements that surpass the state-ofthe-art manufacturing technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these scenarios coming out of a manufacturing system without some type of problem or defect . When we talk about control , two key points must be kept in mind . First , product degradation during manufacture occurs as a result of defects introduced during the process . Second , no matter how hard one tries to remove and elininate defects , a probability always exists that products with latent and/or patent defects are shipped to customers . Do n't forget Mr. Murphy 's Law . Therefore , to eliminate or minimize degradation , we must have all our ducks in a row . This includes , first , ensuring that products are designed with optimal performance safety margins . Second , materials must be specified with proper characteristic tolerances . Finally , manufacturing systems ( or subsystems or equipment ) must be designed to be reliable and maintainable ; to be capable of putting out consistent products ; and to be able to be integrated with special inspections , screens , and tests , as appropriate , to detect and remove defective products . It is the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easy to see that a product must be designed to exhibit the performance levels of reliability , safety , and quality required by the marketplace . In the same light , it must be understood that the manufacturing equipment will not necessarily maintain the required parameter levels . The playing field does n't remain the same . The raw materials change , the operational environment changes , and the equipment parameters change . For example , as we will see in Chapter 7 , equipment maintenance plays a critical role in manufacturing . In an ideal world there is no equipment wear , deterioration , or aging . Unfortunately , in the real world system equipment requires a maintenance strategy and plan . // This chapter focuses on defining and monitoring the system indenture level at which product manufacture actually occurs , in order to minimize degradation that will occur . However , once the overall manufacturing process that the system ( and its equipment ) will perform is defined , it is necessary to determine the optimal system operating conditions . How fast should the machine run ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What temperature should be used for the hot bath ? How often should maintenance be done ? Where should the crimp be on the product ? ( How high should that be and how low should that other thing be in the system equipment , or in the product itself ? ) These are all questions that must be answered , and all can be answered by formal design of experiments ( DOE ) . By developing and implementing the optimal product and manufacturing system and process design , numerous TMA benefits are derived . Leading the list is increased long-term profitability . Others include ? Design - Improved manufacturability - Reduced sensitivity to variability - Value analysis/engineering implemented - Maximized functional performance ? Testing - Factor significance ( critical vs. unimportant ) - Engineering priorities ? Capability - Optimal procedures - Meeting production goals - Optimal operational parameters Figure 1 provides an overview of the DOE process . Depicted are three major steps : ( 1 ) planning the experiment , ( 2 ) implementing and collecting the data , and ( 3 ) performing analysis and interpreting the experimental results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , perhaps the most important concern is the experimental objective . A major benefit of formal DOE is its introduction of structure and discipline and its requirement to define exactly the question to be answered . After defining an objective , it is necessary to get the proper people involved who can provide valuable input based on their industry experience . It is also important to define all the statistical ground rules to be used in the study , such as the decision rule , test statistic , significance level , and so forth . In collecting data , good management practice must be used in running the experiment . The results are almost certain to be biased or invalid if the data is not run and collected as defined . The experimental run should reflect a randomized order to minimize data variability due to introduced biases.
