<p> Director Harold Ramis leans back in his chair , his Buddha-like body relaxed but his eyes intent , glancing between the soundstage and the small video screen in front of him . <p> " Hey ! Knock it off ! ! ! " hollers actor Michael Keaton at an empty couch . On the screen you can see what 's happening : He 's yelling at himself , playing another character , superimposed electronically on the couch . <p> This is the set of " Multiplicity , " a Sony picture that has everything Hollywood loves : star power , a successful director , high-tech wizardry , a simple , catchy premise - a busy man gets cloned to cope with life - and the promise of untold millions at the box office . <p> Ever since Cecil B. DeMille made the first feature-length film in Hollywood in 1913 ( " The Squaw Man " ) , money and star power have driven the American film industry . It 's a high-stakes business where tens of millions of dollars are risked on the ability to spot talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whims of an unpredictable public . <p> " Imagine if you built a skyscraper and the day it was finished , you said , ' Aah , no one likes it . ' So you tore it down . That 's what it 's like , " says Mr. Ramis , who 's written and/or directed such hits as " Ghostbusters " and " Groundhog Day . " <p> As a result , much of Hollywood 's glitz and bravado is underscored by a persistent , gnawing anxiety . And that anxiety is growing . The movie business is undergoing another of its many transformations . And as usual , money is the driving force . <p> Star salaries have shot up , increasing overall costs . Bruce Willis 's $ 5 million salary in 1988 for " Die Hard " shocked the industry . Today , stars like John Travolta and Sylvester Stallone can demand more than $ 20 million . This summer 's spate of media mergers has turned studios like Disney and Warner Bros. into mega-entertainment conglomerates with holdings that range from production houses to television networks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy way to earn extra profits into an economic necessity . In 1994 , international box-office revenues actually surpassed the domestic take for the first time . <p> " The bottom line is that for a company to stay in business today you have to have a worldwide market , " says William Baker , president of the Motion Picture Association , which represents the eight major studios . " Your films have to travel . " <p> About 480 movies are made in the United States each year . The major studios account for approximately 160 of them . The average cost of a studio movie is now about $ 50 million : $ 34 million to make the movie , pay the actors , director , producers , set designers , cinematographers , etc. , and another $ 16 million to market it . <p> Of the 160 movies made by the studios , only 15 to 20 percent actually make enough money at the box office to cover their costs , according to Mr. Baker . When you add in revenues from pay-per-view , video rentals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 percent make money . <p> " So it 's those huge successes like ' Batman Forever ' that really hold up these production studios , " Baker says . " While they may be turning out 20 or 30 movies a year , it 's a small percentage of those that keeps the whole industry alive . " <p> Critics contend the need to make high-grossing films that will fly in Argentina as well as in Illinois has forced the industry to put a premium on violent action films . <p> " The executives in the movie industry today are grinding out cat food on a moving belt , that 's what it is , cat food , " says Frank Peirson , the Academy Award-winning writer of " Cool Hand Luke " ( 1967 ) and " Dog Day Afternoon " ( 1975 ) . <p> Mr. Peirson contends the bottom-line mentality of today 's studios has led to corporate interference on every level of the creative process , which in turn has led to the production of hundreds of mean-spirited , second-rate films . <p> " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce and directors direct , " he says . " But once they got into it , they could n't keep their hands off of it . Now , you have the dull hand of businessmen on every lever . " <p> Others in the industry also feel a frustration with the studios ' increasingly bureaucratic layers of highly paid executives . Every studio executive knows their next decision could be their last , so , critics charge , they 're cautious to a fault . <p> " If they 're spending $ 100 million , they ca n't take a risk , " says Amy Holden Jones , the writer-director of " Mystic Pizza , " " Indecent Proposal , " and " Beethoven . " " It 's much easier to fall back on reliable formulas that have worked in the past - ' Let 's do " Die Hard " on a train , " Die Hard " on a ship , " Die Hard " on a bus ' - than to search out whole new stories and plots and characters . " <p> But as Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more money is available for other types of films . They also look to the independent production houses to provide the creative risk- taking . <p> But the most successful of those independents , like Miramax and New Line Cinemas , have now been bought by larger studios or other corporations . <p> " It 's not that they want to put you out of business , " Peirson says . " They just see a profitable business they want to add to their own . " <p> That kind of basic business instinct has always been key to Hollywood 's success . But unless that skill is matched with an instinct for spotting talent , history has shown , it 's proved to have deep limitations . <p> The original movie tycoons , like Paramount 's Adolf Zukor , Universal 's Carl Laemmle , and MGM 's Louis Mayer , were businessmen of immigrant stock who also had some experience with vaudeville . <p> Most started showing short films in the back of arcades in the early 1900s , and thousands of dollars suddenly rolled in . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not satisfied with the entertainment quality of the short films that others were making , they set out to create their own independent feature-length films . <p> But to do so , they first had to outwit the Eastern establishment bankers and businessmen who controlled what came to be known as the " Trust . " In 1908 , Thomas Edison called together the eight largest motion-picture producers and proposed creating a monopoly with control over all production and distribution of films . Since Edison owned the patents on most movie cameras and projectors , and the businessmen controlled most of the country 's movie production , it was easy . Before the year was over , they had a complete monopoly . <p> But it did n't last . While the Trust had the money and control , it lacked vision and an understanding of entertainment . After four years of warfare with the Jewish immigrant upstarts who became known as the Independents , the Trust was broken and Hollywood was born . <p> " Hollywood was always a big cash cow , but they were family-owned films , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictures ... made films because he loved movies and he knew movies . He made pictures that made him laugh and cry . " <p> Successful movies still have to move people . That means they need great scripts , talented actors and directors , and executives with the savvy to package the material . <p> " I think you have to understand that the currency of the business - the dollars and cents - is really the talent , " says Robert Dowling , editor in chief and publisher of " The Hollywood Reporter . " <p> And the kind of talent that can crank out blockbusters with international appeal is extremely rare . So , in line with the law of supply and demand , salaries continue to skyrocket , which sends production costs spiraling , and inspires even more caution in the studio executives . While that raises indignation in some , for others it 's simply part of Hollywood 's economic reality . <p> " These executives are not stupid people , " Ramis says . " Take a script without a star and without a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll say to you , ' I ca n't make it , it 's character-driven , not star-driven . ' I think a lot of them are in conflict themselves . " <p> Others in the industry also maintain that you ca n't make audiences watch a lousy movie . Hollywood must be doing something right , they argue , because it 's making money . <p> But there is also caution in the wind . Some of the latest big-budget , high-action thrillers have been greeted with big yawns . The high level of violence in some movies is raising concern nationwide . And technology again threatens to give Americans an array of other entertainment options . <p> " Hollywood has its cycles , " says John Krier , president of Exhibitor Relations , a Los Angeles company that tracks film grosses . " There have been lots of times when people thought the business was ending - before talkies came along , when TV was invented , when video came along . But we 've always rebounded . Like a phoenix .
