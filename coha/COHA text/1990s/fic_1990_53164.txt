He kept the maps . They 'd had a cardboard Kahlua box of maps , forest service maps , topo maps , road maps , some of them from the early Sixties when his parents had taken him and his brothers on road trips in the summers . She had to admit they were mostly his maps , though she 'd grown to love them , their gift of anticipation , their memory of blind stabs at settling down , of wilderness euphoria . After thirteen years the Kahlua box was soft as dish towels along the corners . <p> " That 's my favorite boulder in the Cascades , " she told her sister . They were both on the wagon , drinking cranberry tea and talking early marriages . " We camped under it in February one year and walked up into the mountains and hugged trees . " Her sister said , " You were stoned , right ? " " Yeah , " she said , smiling and shaking her head yes and flipping the photo album page .

They had taken two major trips by thumb : one from Oregon to Arizona in the middle of winter and one from Lumby , British Columbia , to Seattle , also in the winter . During these trips , life went on . They made love in the A-frame North Face mountain tent ; she complained about how cramped she was on top . She sometimes cried at night , missing her sisters . They fed fragile , hopeful camp fires , drinking brandy and talking , weaving the toughest cloth of their fears and desires , finding out what they believed in . They fought over whether to eat in a restaurant or cook over a camp fire . They never had any money to speak of , but there was a stamina to their love . They prided themselves on having endured . Seventeen below ; Nevada ; camping in an arroyo among cages of snowy sagebrush . That 's love of a different color , her girlfriends said . Hard-core . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rime like crystal sugar everywhere . They did it because they thought they were both born to the road . <p> Once they had a cabin with a big black Monarch cookstove . This was in the beginning . Lightning pinwheeled into their bedroom and he leaped from the bed and found a book of poems and read her a poem in the storm . They carried water from the creek and shared a zinc tub of steaming bath water . She scrubbed his back with a loofah . They made love in the parsnip patch in broad daylight . At night there were always the stars and he knew them by name . At a garage sale , they bought a cast iron skillet and an oriental rug . From secondhand Modern Library hardbacks , they read stories aloud to each other . There were always pileated woodpeckers , red whips of willows , evening sunlight only a gold band above the mountain ; there were always animal tracks , lichened stones , creeks , applewood , fir , wild plums ; there were always , always the stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orion , Cygnus , Sirius . He smelled like Balkan Sobranie tobacco and wool Woolrich shirts , and his arms were archetypal arms , arms of the woodsman who 'd saved her from the wolf within . <p> The day they moved away from the cabin they stood on the porch and cried in each other 's arms . That was the first loss they 'd ever shared , shocked at its sweetness . <p> In town , the first town , the elementary school blazed white as sand in the winter sun . He was a student at the college and she taught at the elementary school . Kites tattered from the cottonwoods beside the playground . Their wantonness required practice . " Talk to me , " she said . " You have to have a bit of the ham , the rake , in you to do this . Coax me . Be sly . You know how easy I am .

" " How does it feel for you to come ? " he said . " It 's like stealing something . " " Stealing home , " he said . She was a marauder , slip of a woman in the flying night , stealing whatever she could , fingers tender and blind , grafting bliss to truancy , crazed absence of self . It was something like an old blues song : that bad , winsome , visceral . She knew how it worked . They found them  --  the very words  --  and they became his charm and code , his mojo , sweet-bone totem , the rib and thorn in their fenny winter bed . <p> They each had private dreams and these were difficult to realize together . The first time she talked about moving away , she cried into a brakeman 's bandanna until her eyes were puffy . Finally he said , " Maybe it 's a good idea . Maybe I need to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she 'd figure out some other way to make her dreams come true . That was in the second year and they had eleven more years to go . <p> For a long time they took turns moving for each other ; the one who followed always felt cheated . <p> Even now , when she peruses certain maps , she imagines all the places they slept outdoors together . Beside rivers , with that rushing , that glassy , green blooming of the waves : Clark Fork , Gallatin , Yellowstone , Lochsa , Columbia , Methow , Okanogan , Entiat , Wenatchee , Skagit , Rogue , Klamath , Williamson , Santiam , Umpqua , Bella Coola , Fraser , Thompson , Quesnel , Chilcotin . Too numerous to mention were the creeks and lakes . And the mountains they ranged : the Cascades , the Rainbows , the Monashees , the Purcells , the Selkirks , the Tobacco Roots , the Madison Range , the Big Belts . Field mice ; blackened pots , wood-smoked sleeping bags zipping together ; their breath visible in the mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bite of the mother 's moon tooth . <p> You are no doubt thinking , There had to be more to it than that . And there was . She had abandonment issues and anxiety attacks , he had unresolved bitterness toward his mother , she believed in gun control , he did n't , she cut her hair , he grew a beard , they disagreed about chocolate , John Sayles , the Democrats in 1988 , meat eating , the virtues and hassles of waxed skis , Bruce Springsteen , pasta vs. brown rice , Greenpeace . Each one thought the other too autonomous . They talked about individuation , sure and fated as spring giving way to summer . Eventually there were other lovers . You get the picture . <p> At Shi-Shi Beach near Neah Bay , they slept together outdoors for the last time . To the Indians , Shi-Shi meant big magic . The unrestrained Pacific dumped rain on them four days running . Deer cavorted in the surf .

She has a crescent-shaped scar  --  petite petroglyph  --  on the back of her right hand , from falling into a rocky , rain-swollen creek on the walk out . She thinks it 's a scar that wo n't fade and that pleases her , to have the mark of Shi-Shi . <p> Before that particular July , for several years , they practiced moving away from each other . They were getting used to the idea . First there were separate pleasure trips . Then they began going away to work , a month here , two months there , a summer . Finally she took a job in another state , 1700 miles away . They thought they could manage ; they were good at reunions . <p> They broke the rules like pottery , with that little regret . Their letters of break-up crossed in the mail , one of many blessings that befell them over the years .

The apples were nearly ripe . The whole tiny house smelled of fresh pocket bread ; he baked bread so often , the muslin curtains gave off the odor of yeast and sugar . They cried , made love , slept . They had left an open bottle of Polish vodka on the kitchen table . Once , in the middle of the night , she went out to the screened-in porch . An inverted yellow kayak glowed under the clothesline . She could n't deny feeling free , a kind of joy in the soles of her feet . The night had grown frost on the dull grass ; smudge pots tilted under the trees . Stars stirred above them like fading fires , trying to focus through mottled clouds . This is how she thought of the stars : blurry , a little drunk , still there . <p> <p> By Patricia Henley <p>
