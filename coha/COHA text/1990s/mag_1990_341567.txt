Hard-nosed reporters rarely turn into emotional softies when appraising their bosses . But there were few dry eyes at last week 's staff meeting after Philadelphia Inquirer executive editor Eugene Roberts Jr. , 58 , announced that he would retire from the paper that he had transformed from a second-rate daily into the crown jewel of the Knight-Ridder chain . " There were lots of eyes that were swimming and voices that broke , " says reporter B.J. Phillips . " Everybody is here because of him . " <P> When the quiet , slightly rumpled New York Times national editor took over the Inquirer in 1972 , it was considered one of the 10 worst big-city newspapers in the country . He quickly assembled an enterprising staff and gave it generous amounts of time , money and column inches to tackle tough subjects and tangle with public figures . He permitted some reporters to work as long as two years on a single investigative project . The results were an impressive 17 Pulitzer Prizes in 18 years , including one this year for a five-part series on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts assembled a newsroom that was , pound for pound , better than anyone 's , " says Charles Eisendrath , director of the University of Michigan 's Journalism Fellows Program . <P> Roberts says he is leaving to travel and teach , but several staff members contend that he is exiting primarily because he was worn down by his ongoing tug-of-war with Knight-Ridder officials . Worried about flat circulation ( 522,000 ) and flagging advertising revenue ( despite respectable pretax profits ) , the corporate managers tightened Roberts ' purse strings . This spring he lost a page of space on weekdays and twice that amount on Sundays . He also had to report to a publisher newly appointed to oversee both the news and business operations , a combined position that Roberts vigorously opposed . The biggest challenge facing the new editor , Roberts protege Maxwell E.P . King , 46 , will be to maintain his predecessor 's standards of excellence in an era of belt tightening and corporate control .                  @ @ @
