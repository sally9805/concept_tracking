<p> The news story on the alarming increase in downtown vehicular traffic ( " Downtown 's growth choking streets , " Nov. 28 ) suggests that the primary focus of city planners and merchants is on increasing the number of parking spaces . Conspicuously missing is any interest in substantially increasing the frequency and quality of CTA service . <p> This is unfortunate , for there is a huge opportunity for well-planned mass transit to help alleviate the predicted 25 percent yearly increases in the 300,000 cars and 700,000 pedestrians already choking the Loop daily , as well as the comparable congestion in nearby Streeterville . <p> In addition to the increasing number of people commuting to and from downtown , more people are living downtown . They add an entirely new layer of traffic as they travel between their homes and their jobs , run errands and visit cultural , culinary and entertainment venues  --  all within the downtown area . Perhaps a significant percentage of these new residents could be encouraged to use the CTA if frequent , reliable and attractive service is made available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installing median and sidewalk planters , power-cleaning sidewalks regularly , developing the Randolph Street Theater District , performing reconstructive surgery on State Street and giving face-lifts to La Salle , Dearborn and other major arteries . The ambitious Millennium Park under construction in Grant Park is yet another example of this visionary leadership . <p> But then there 's the CTA . Although several modest improvements have been made in the last few years , the CTA still lacks the kind of appeal needed to persuade downtown residents to use it for short trips . <p> For example , the platforms in the State Street subway stations were power-cleaned last year . Imagine how attractive they might look with the same kind of face-lift that the State Street sidewalks above them got . It is not enough for the CTA to go from very dingy to less dingy . Less frequent service on many lines wo n't attract new riders , either . <p> Through bold innovations , Chicago has snared high-quality development and new residents . As a result , a first-class downtown is emerging . As we face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take bold steps to reverse the mentality that mass transit is second-class transportation . <p> Benjamin E. Alba , <p> treasurer , <p> Grant Park Advisory Council <p> A future of gridlock <p> If the congestion at O'Hare Airport at Thanksgiving is any indication of what it will be like on a routine basis after the terminal expansion , the following should be mandatory : <p> Extending the Blue Line L to Schaumburg . <p> Double-tracking the Wisconsin Central RR to Mundelein for more commuter trains to Antioch . <p> Get construction under way for the proposed commuter line from O'Hare to Midway to the south suburbs . <p> Build a station where the CTA Blue Line and the Metra North Central Line meet so passengers can make any easy transfer to Metra trains . <p> Richard H. Frenzel , Uptown <p> Not our mess to clean <p> In Illinois we have 26 of the nation 's most dangerous toxic waste sites . Often referred to as Superfund sites , they have contaminated communities , poisoning the air , ground and drinking water with chemicals known to cause cancer , birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are five sites , including the DuPage County Landfill/Blackwell Forest Preserve in Warrenville and Kerr-McGee in West Chicago . Add the Tri-County Landfill Company/Waste Management of Illinois Inc. in South Elgin , and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has a total of six Superfund sites in his district . <p> At many Superfund sites , toxic substances leach into the groundwater , a source of drinking water for half the U.S. population . They also can leach into the soil , making it dangerous to plant or play in the area . <p> The Superfund law was passed in response to public outrage at highly publicized toxic tragedies , such as Love Canal , N.Y. , and Woburn , Mass . The law is based on the " polluter pays " principle , which makes responsible polluters , not innocent taxpayers , pay to clean up these sites . Unfortunately , Congress has been listening to the polluters and is poised to pass a bill that would weaken cleanup standards at Superfund sites . <p> We urge Hastert to lead efforts to strengthen , not weaken , the Superfund law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safely and permanently ; continue to make polluters , not taxpayers , pay to clean up toxic waste sites ; prevent future pollution by expanding public reporting of toxic chemical emissions and requiring reporting on toxic chemical use , and allow citizens more input in the cleanup of their neighborhoods . <p> Danielle Estler , <p> campaign director , <p> Illinois Public Interest <p> Research Group <p> Not running a charity <p> While I agree with the need for affordable housing ( who could object to that ? ) , I think we cloud the issue if we actually mean subsidized housing , which is what I gathered from the news story ( " Housing push on North Shore ; groups aim to create affordable options , " Nov. 29 ) . <p> I live on the North Shore . We moved here 25 years ago , when we both worked and did n't have any kids . We could n't afford to move here now . Should I expect the government to chip in for me so I could move here ? <p> I voted against the last school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to live here as it can . I will pay for this " affordable housing " through my income taxes and then through increased property taxes for these expensive schools . <p> Sorry , but when you tax people to help others , you try to find the most economical way to do it . I do n't expect rescue missions to serve beef tenderloin to the homeless , and I do n't think you should try to place people in expensive areas and then expect everyone to pay for it . <p> Larry Craig , Wilmette <p> Everybody can play <p> In its proposed fiscal 2000 budget , the Chicago Park District increased the fees for a number of its programs : day camp , classes and gymnastics . The Civic Federation believed that the proposed fee increases were counterproductive to the district 's mission , to provide for the recreational and open space needs of all Chicagoans . If the district wants residents to take advantage of its services , how does charging them more accomplish that ? <p> Since the release of the original budget , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases . By doing so , the district is sending a clear message to the public that they not only are welcome in the district 's facilities but that these facilities also are the public 's property and that the public should take advantage of them . <p> Myer Blank , <p> director of policy analysis , <p> Civic Federation <p> Collecting overdue bill <p> In his letter ( Dec. 1 ) , Dr. Sam Gidding suggested that 50 percent of the tobacco settlement funds go toward establishing a comprehensive tobacco control and prevention plan . The Kids Share coalition would like to see the other half invested in early childhood , child care and youth development programs . <p> More than 80 organizations have joined us as Kids Share members . High-quality early childhood , child care and youth development programs are smoking prevention programs in and of themselves . These programs , which provide children with a healthy environment , are in crisis and need additional funding . <p> Tobacco companies have targeted children for decades . Big Tobacco has traded the health of youth for profit . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Kids Share Coalition , <p> Day Care Action Council <p> of Illinois <p> Preventive measures <p> I notice that so much of the polarity in the gun control debate centers on whether new gun laws effectively would reduce firearm violence . <p> Advocates are convinced that any firearm legislation is necessary , adopting the " even if only one life is saved " justification . Opponents point out the myriad existing laws that are repeatedly and routinely violated by those with criminal intent . <p> I also notice that many of the sensational deaths involving firearms end with the murderer taking his or her own life . Until now society seemed powerless in preventing murder-suicides . <p> I suggest we resolve both of these issues by demanding immediate legislation that compels firearm perpetrators to kill themselves before killing others ( suicide-murder ) . Think of the innocent lives saved as would-be killers conform to this sensible new law . Moreover , this law would inspire other effective legislation , extending similar prohibitions to knives , autos , poisons , explosives and jetliners . <p> Finally , we could outlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did we not think of this before ? <p> Alan D.
