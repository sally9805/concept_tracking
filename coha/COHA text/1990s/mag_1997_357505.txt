George Bush may have been right about broccoli after all . According to a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University , you do n't have to eat a full helping of the hated vegetable to get the health benefits ; a spoonful of crunchy broccoli sprouts will do the trick . Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , the researchers report that three-day-old broccoli sprouts ( which look something like alfalfa sprouts ) contain the same cancer-fighting chemical , called sulforaphane , as full-grown spears  --  but at concentrations 20 to 50 times as high . <P> This is not the first time that scientists have lauded broccoli 's anticancer benefits . Johns Hopkins ' Dr. Paul Talalay and his colleagues first isolated sulforaphane from broccoli in 1992 . Tests showed that the compound reduced the incidence of breast tumors in rats by 60% . While vitamin E and other antioxidants attack rogue cancer-causing molecules directly , sulforaphane works indirectly by boosting the body 's cancer-fighting defenses . Not all broccoli plants are created equal , however . The amount of sulforaphane found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreliable anticancer agent . <P> That 's where the sprouts come in . After analyzing 50 different varieties of broccoli , the Hopkins researchers discovered that 15 of those strains produced seedlings with extraordinarily high concentrations of sulforaphane . The sprouts have a mildly spicy taste , which should make them more palatable than full-grown broccoli , especially when sprinkled on sandwiches and salads . But you probably wo n't find them at your local health-food store  --  not yet , anyway . And Talalay cautions do-it-yourselfers against trying to grow their own sprouts . Most broccoli seeds , he notes , are soaked in fungicides and pesticides . <P>  --  By Christine Gorman . Reported by David Bjerklie/New York
