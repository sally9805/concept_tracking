EXT . THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST , DAY . FLYING P.O.V. A road . Straight as a beam of light . A broken white line strobing atop jet black tarmac . As CREDITS ROLL the terrain on either side of the road changes often and dramatically . Blinding green pasture land gives way to blazing red clay which in turn gives way to hellish black char . We encounter dense smoke , fire , felled timberland , gray fog , jungle . The road ends . A dense forest of green treetops bursts into view for as far as the eye can see . Birds soar and float . A verdant mountain peak protrudes through a cloud , a thunderous waterfall roars , and slowly our P.O.V. descends towards the treetops . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST , THE TOP OF THE CANOPY , SAME We are descending now like a spider into the forest . A hundred feet above the ground , the sunlit canopy is filled with colorful exotic birds and howler monkeys , but as we descend further we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dank , dripping world of enormous tree trunks , bizarre plants , teaming insects , and fungi . Now fifty feet above the ground and descending , we see a flying squirrel and then a flying snake . A clear frog leaps into view then away . We are in a world of plants and animals so fecund and yet so eerie , their images are usually reserved for the domain of science fiction or horror . Our descent continues down a beautiful liana vine , bursting with spectacular lavender flowers , covering a stately tree from which it gains life : choking the tree to death . CREDITS END . And so does our descent on a giant iridescent green leaf . Covering it , devouring it like scavengers , are spotted yellow ants . &nbsp; MAN 'S VOICEHere . A shaking forceps protrudes into FRAME and flicks away the ants . A human hack cough intrudes . An ant or two crawl onto a man 's finger and bite it .  --  3  --  &nbsp; MAN 'S VOICE ( coughing ) Ow . Damn ! WIDEN TO REVEAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one white . A PULL BACK reveals a white man kneeling beside a native Indian both dwarfed by the enormous roots , stilts , buttresses and trees that populate the floor of the rain forest . The Indian wears only a primitive loin cloth , headband , bracelets , and anklets . The white man , a cigarette dangling from his mouth , coughing , also wears an Indian headband , bracelet , and anklets but he also wears a seldom-washed pair of shorts , and a sweat-soaked shirt . And from his fingers , on strings , dangle various magnifying glasses , dissecting tools , specimen bottles , etc . The real Indian is JAHAUSA . The wanna-be Indian is DR . RICHARD CAMPBELL , fifties , and in spite of his getup still an attractive man . Campbell anxiously tries to get the ants off this leaf . Seeing that Campbell is having trouble , Jahausa takes the forceps from the coughing Campbell . &nbsp; CAMPBELLDo n't lose this leaf , Jahausa . I ca n't afford to lose it . Jahausa flicks away ants with the forceps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CAMPBELLGood . &nbsp; JAHAUSACigarettes stupid , Dr. Campbell . &nbsp; CAMPBELLVery perceptive , Jahausa . Give the man his doctorate . Campbell holds up the bottle to examine the leaf then coughs again . Jahausa watches then impulsively snatches the cigarette away . &nbsp; CAMPBELLAll right . Very funny . Give it back . Jahausa does n't . &nbsp; CAMPBELLGo fuck a monkey , Jahausa . It 's my last one and I want it .  --  4  --  Campbell holds out his hand for it . Instead of handing it over , Jahausa pops the burning cigarette into his own mouth , whole . After a moment he spits it into his hand and hands it back to Campbell . It 's now a saliva-soaked , mess . &nbsp; CAMPBELLNow look what you 've done . You 've ruined it . &nbsp; JAHAUSAGive the man his doctorate . Campbell puts his hands on his hips and stares at Jahausa . Campbell is trying to be angry but a little smile peeks through . A young Indian , PALALA , comes running from the woods . &nbsp; PALALADr . Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . He speaks his native Indian tongue at high speed . &nbsp; CAMPBELLSlow down , Palala . Jahausa , what 's he saying ? &nbsp; JAHAUSAHe say his wife is cured . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThat 's impossible . Palala gestures wildly and starts away . He waits excitedly for Campbell to follow . &nbsp; CAMPBELLShe ca n't be cured , Palala . As Campbell and Jahausa follow Palala off into the forest , HOLD ON the leafy plant . The yellow ants have attacked another leaf . They devour it so fast , it disappears before our eyes . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( O.S. ) She ca n't be cured , Palala ! DISSOLVE TO : Section Details INT .

OUT THE DOOR INTO THE TERMINAL Eight street urchins , ages four to fourteen , surround a stylishly dressed European couple . As two of the urchins beg for money , the other six pick the couple 's pockets . Since the couple only have four hands between them and the urchins have sixteen , the urchins manage to take every possession the tourists possess . The tourists struggle and yell , but the orphans finish their work and disappear into the crowd . &nbsp; RAEWhy does n't someone help them ? She starts out .

Though he ca n't see a thing , Renato continues to drive through the black smoke . All three of them begin coughing spasmodically . Suddenly Rae screams . HEAD-ON An oncoming car shoots by . It misses hitting them by a millimeter . It happens so fast - in and out of this black smoke - that it 's surreal . Renato jerks the van to the right and tries to keep control . Suddenly , as quickly as it was enveloped , the van bursts into clear air . Renato , coughing fitfully , unable to drive , maneuvers onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAME Renato , Rae and Ornega leap out of the van , coughing . &nbsp; IMANAWe must go . Before the wind shifts .

Is there a forest fire ? &nbsp; IMANAA man made one , yes . Rae looks perplexed . &nbsp; RAEWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; IMANAIt 's slash and burn . To clear the land . Renato puts it in gear and they drive away . Now the wind is blowing another way , and we get a good look at what slash and burn is :  --  14  --  As far as the eye can see into the forest is a red inferno of charred trees and burning stumps . &nbsp; RAEIt 's awful . We almost died . &nbsp; ORNEGAHundreds die every year . Come the dry season , the road will be littered with accidents . &nbsp; RAEMy god , why is n't it outlawed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; IMANAYou got millions of poor people moving into this area , tica . To farm , they have to clear the land somehow . You think they can afford chain saws ? ( pause ) Besides , the charcoal fertilizes the soil . &nbsp; ORNEGAFor about three years and then it becomes desert . Rain forest may look lush but the topsoil is terrible . He points out the window . In the distance , are miles of hard red clay desert . &nbsp; ORNEGA ( V. O. ) The farmers just keep moving and burning , slashing and burning , hopelessly looking for a way to grow food in bad soil . &nbsp; IMANAThey do what they have to do . The farmers here have a joke : You know what you call a burning body on the highway ? ... ( Rae shakes her head ) Free fertilizer . He laughs . Ornega and Rae do n't . As they drive on , Rae stares in silence at Dante 's inferno . DISSOLVE TO :  --  15  --  EXT . TRAVELING SEQUENCE , DAY . NIGHT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amazon basin , Rae experiences the sights and sounds that are the changing shape of this once undeveloped region : They pass gigantic logging rigs attending to piles of logged trees three stories high . They pass overnight towns filled with appalling squalor . They pass caravans of squatters from the cities - third-world versions of dust bowl refugees - in dilapidated pick-ups piled with furniture , bite covered children , emaciated grandparents , emaciated dogs . A flagman holds up Renato 's van while a chain saw fells a giant tree . As the tree slowly begins to fall , two monkeys trapped atop the tree scream . The monkeys fall with their perch . The tree crashes to the ground right in front of Renato 's stopped van . After a tractor pushes the tree off the road , two workmen sweep up the dead monkeys and toss their bodies onto the shoulder of the road like garbage . The flag man waves Renato 's car onward . As they pass by , Rae stares at the bodies of the dead monkeys . Two bulldozers are attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldozers move in tandem across the forest , every tree in sight is pulled to the ground . The road crosses a river . Jamming the river in all directions for as the eye can see are logs . Acres of them . Miles of them . A group of peasants stand by the side of the road with their hands up . The Colonel and his men herd them into an army vehicle . They pass through a red desert , stark and ugly , where it seems that not a creature could survive . More rain forest , dense and overgrown . The last of civilization seems behind them . Renato puts on a tape of upbeat Brazilian music and the van disappears down the road .  --  16  --  EXT . THE END OF THE ROAD , DAY We saw it in the credits though it undoubtedly hardly registered : here the road just ends . Stops . No warning signs , no guard rails , nothing . The forest seems to have cut the road off cleanly like a knife through a lizard 's tail . Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are rusty old bulldozers and road building equipment . A few yards from road 's end , Renato , Ornega , and Rae wait . Rae 's bags are nearby . &nbsp; RAEThey know it 's today ? &nbsp; ORNEGADefinitely . Three o'clock . &nbsp; IMANAYou should n't go , tica . It 's an omen . Have I told you about the snakes ? They have snakes that --  &nbsp; ORNEGARenato , may I speak to Miss Crane in private ? &nbsp; IMANASure . Renato just stands there . Ornega leads Rae aside . &nbsp; ORNEGAI may be telling you something you already know but since you 're going to be out there essentially alone with him , I think you should know that our university has had some problems with Dr. Campbell . &nbsp; RAEWhat kind of problems ? &nbsp; ORNEGAUntil three years ago , Campbell was a stable researcher though perhaps --  off-beat . We called him the jungle philosopher . Then his wife of fifteen years , who was also his research partner , came in from the field and never went back . &nbsp; RAEUm . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell he took it quite badly . He sent back all of his field assistants . Stopped answering our radio communiques . Even relocated the university research station without so much as a notice . &nbsp; RAEWow . &nbsp; ORNEGAIf he were n't a tenured professor , he would have been fired . &nbsp; RAEWas he reprimanded ? &nbsp; ORNEGAIt was considered but it 's hard not to be sympathetic . You see his wife ran off with another professor in the bio-sciences and apparently even published some of Campbell 's research under her own name . He 's bitter . Probably blames the university . ( pause ) Last month 's message is the first thing we 've heard from him in three years . &nbsp; RAEWell , I was told to expect an eccentric . Sounds like that still holds . &nbsp; ORNEGARumors are he 's gone native . Into native medicines , native spirits , that sort of thing . You have an uplink so stay in close contact . I would gladly go with you but Campbell was adamant about having only one person . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAEThank you .  --  18  --  &nbsp; ORNEGAI 'm a little surprised they did n't they tell you what you were getting into . Or that they would send a woman . &nbsp; RAETo be honest , they did n't want to send me but I pushed to come . I 'm engaged so this may be my last chance for quite a while for an adventure . &nbsp; ORNEGAWell I hope for your sake it 's an uneventful one . ( pause ) I do n't know the sentiment in the States , Miss Crain , but down here we are very skeptical of Dr. Campbell . His communique and all of his demands for secrecy hint that he thinks he 's made a big discovery . But I would like to emphasize that at all costs we would like to avoid any kind of fusion-in-a-flask fiasco , if you know what I mean ? &nbsp; RAEI do . &nbsp; ORNEGAThe battles between the scientific community and developers are hard enough without our losing credibility through false claims . &nbsp; IMANA ( O.S. ) Here they are . &nbsp; RAEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian , riding a donkey , emerges from the dense forest . We recognize him as Jahausa , the Indian from the beginning of the movie who soaked Campbell 's cigarette . &nbsp; JAHAUSAPae Crain ?  --  19  --  Rae walks to Jahausa and offers her hand . &nbsp; RAEI 'm Rae Crain . Jahausa recoils from her hand . Instead he holds out a surgeon 's mask and mumbles something in Indian . &nbsp; IMANAYou 're supposed to wear that . Dr. Campbell 's orders . &nbsp; RAEWhy ? Renato asks Jahausa who answers . &nbsp; IMANAQuarantine . Rae shoots Ornega a glance then takes the surgeon 's mask . Jahausa loads her bags onto a donkey . She shakes with Renato , then Ornega . &nbsp; RAEThank you , doctor . You 'll be hearing from me . Good luck , Renato . &nbsp; IMANACareful of the spikefish , tica ! Rae smiles then puts on the surgeon 's mask . She boards a donkey and rides off into the jungle with Jahausa . EXT . THE RAIN FOREST , DAY Rae and Jahausa make their way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , the ground is not covered with dense foliage , but is almost barren of plants save the giant , magnificent , sculptural tree trunks . Also , the place is dim . The sunlight is almost completely blocked by the leaf canopy one hundred plus feet up , and very little light seeps in . EXT . DEEP IN THE RAIN FOREST , NIGHT Jahausa finishes tying a hammock between two trees . From a bag he removes two rat size lizards on strings and ties one to each end of the hammock . Rae looks concerned . &nbsp; JAHAUSABugs.  --  20  --  He makes a flicking motion with his tongue . &nbsp; JAHAUSAYou sleep . &nbsp; RAESure . Less than overjoyed with this arrangement , Rae nevertheless climbs into the hammock . With two giant bug-eating lizards staring her in the face , she tries to get comfortable for sleep . She watches through one wary open eye as the lizards " tongue up " insects at a rapid rate . EXT . A CLOUD FOREST GORGE AND WATERFALL , DAY This is a cloud forest . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an almost permanent tropical fog , and the vegetation drips sweat . The donkeys make their way through the bottom of a gorge , beside a raging waterfall . Rae pulls out a camera and snaps a picture . Jahausa stops and sees the camera . He walks over with his donkey and poses in the frame for a picture . Rae takes it . &nbsp; pp. 21-41 EXT . CAMPBELL 'S RAIN FOREST RESEARCH STATION , AFTERNOON Loin clothed Indians sit around a fire tending to food , making feathered clothes , headpieces , etc . Naked children play . There 's a wooden shack , several mud and grass huts , clothes drying on sticks , and a few unusual animals , including many large lizards , hanging around as pets . INT . THE RESEARCH STATION SHACK , SAME Dr. Campbell , the man we saw at the beginning of the movie , sits at a wooden table , cigarette dangling out of his mouth , making notes in a notebook . Though Campbell is a scientist , his digs do not portray the characteristic neatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Papers are scattered everywhere . Bottles of chemicals and test tubes seem discarded wherever they were last used . From the woods outside comes an Indian yell . Into the camp come Jahausa and Rae , now being followed by native children . Jahausa gets off his donkey and helps untie Rae 's things . Rae dismounts . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( to himself upon seeing Rae ) I do n't believe it .  --  21  --  EXT . THE CAMP , SAME Campbell exits his shack . Rae is surprised by his Indian-like dress . &nbsp; CAMPBELLJahausa , back off . ( to Rae ) Take off your mask . &nbsp; RAEThat 's a nice hello . &nbsp; CAMPBELLTake it off . Rae does . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThey ca n't be serious ; you 're nineteen years old . I asked for a research assistant and they send me a brownie scout ? Rae crosses her arms . &nbsp; CAMPBELLYou have to go back . This is ridiculous . Have you ever even been in a rain forest before ? &nbsp; RAEI was in Costa Rica for a month . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picnic ! What 'd you do there , make girl scout cookies ? &nbsp; RAENow listen --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLI do n't mean to be rude . It 's not your fault . You 've made a long trip and I 'm sure you 're tired so why do n't you rest up , have some dinner , and I 'll make arrangements for you to go back tonight . Jahausa . ( Keenta lapartha. )  --  22  --  Campbell shakes his head as he heads back into his shack . Rae watches as the natives put her bags back near the donkeys . INT . THE RESEARCH STATION MAIN SHACK , SAME Campbell is at an old , manual typewriter , typing furiously . His cigarette ashes fall into the keys . Rae storms in , not wearing a mask . &nbsp; RAENow you listen to me you ingrate . I am not nineteen I 'm twenty eight . I finished first in my class at Smith , won a Fulbright Scholarship to Oxford and pardon me if I 'm rude but given your status at the moment , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most certainly have no intentions of staying where I 'm not wanted , but after traveling five days by plane , car and ass to get here , I 'll be damned if I 'm going to simply turn around and go home tonight . You will provide me with a decent meal if you know what that is , a comfortable place to sleep if you have one , and I will be on my way tomorrow . You seem to have an inflated view of yourself , Dr. Campbell , but I promise you you will rot before they send you someone as competent as me again . She turns and storms out . Campbell watches her . He puts the cigarette back in his mouth and continues typing . EXT . THE CAMPSITE , SAME The natives watch as Rae , steaming mad , tries to unload her donkey . Campbell walks to the door of the shack . He watches as Rae loses control of one of her bags and it falls to the ground . He shouts to her . &nbsp; CAMPBELLPut your mask on when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what diseases you might be carrying . The Indians move to help Rae .  --  23  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLJahausa , keep your distance . ( Popu nei . ) Jahausa and the Indians reluctantly back off . Rae , fuming , picks up her bags by herself . EXT . THE CAMPSITE , NIGHT Campbell and Rae sit eating dinner beside a fire . Sitting away from them are the Indians . Rae is still furious and the natives sense the tension between her and Campbell . Campbell smokes while he eats and works on a paper , totally ignoring Rae . Finally he looks over his paper and sees Rae having trouble cutting her meat . &nbsp; CAMPBELLYour meat too tough ? Lenia , ( geatal ) . &nbsp; RAELet 's not bother being civil , okay ? I do n't like you , you do n't like me . Let 's leave it that way . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI have n't meant to be rude .... &nbsp; RAEYes , I 'm sure it comes quite naturally . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( ignoring this ) It 's just that this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no place for an old asshole either , but you 're here , so let me eat in peace . Jesus , even on death row they let you have your last meal in peace . &nbsp; CAMPBELLFine . I 'll assume the buzzard 's acceptable . Rae pauses mid-chew . She looks at her meat . &nbsp; RAEBuzzard ?  --  24  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLYep . Regular old Buteo Cathartidae . But Lenia hides it nicely with lizard sauce do n't you think ? Rae clearly does n't like the bird or the sauce but she swallows . She looks at a female Indian , Lenia who smiles . She turns back to Campbell . &nbsp; RAESure beats the cock roaches we ate in La Selva . All eat in silence . Campbell watches as Rae eats her meal . She 's passed this test anyway . After a moment Campbell stands , scrapes the scraps off his plate into the fire , then goes to the door of his shed . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWell I 'm turning in . Sorry you came all this way for nothing . &nbsp; RAEYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of nowhere without help . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI 've insulted you , I understand . But please remember that I am a tenured professor at two Universities . I will get good help . &nbsp; RAEAs long as you believe that , that 's all that matters . Good night . &nbsp; CAMPBELLMiss Crane , that 's the second time you 've intimated that I 'm somehow desperate out here . What have you been told about me ? &nbsp; RAEWe have nothing to talk about , Dr. Campbell . &nbsp; CAMPBELLYou 've clearly been told something . What ?  --  25  --  Rae thinks then speaks . &nbsp; RAEI 've been told the facts . That you once had a promising career that you ruined with self pity . That you think you 've made some kind of major discovery that you do n't want to share . And that you 've lost most of your credibility in the scientific community , but you do n't know it . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThen why did they send you , god damn it ? To prove me a liar ? To prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger and insult you . &nbsp; CAMPBELLMiss Crain , I want a straight answer . &nbsp; RAEI 'm here ... to prevent you from embarrassing the University . Campbell looks at Rae for a moment then turns and goes back into his shack . &nbsp; CAMPBELLBull shit . That 's the most ridiculous thing I 've ever heard . INT . CAMPBELL 'S SHACK , NIGHT Campbell sits down , angrily thinking to himself . He starts to type , stops , then sits thinking . INT . RAE 'S HUT , NIGHT Rae stands opening a suitcase . Campbell enters . &nbsp; RAEEver heard of knocking ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI want you to stay until Friday .  --  26  --  &nbsp; RAESorry , I just made restaurant reservations in Paris . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI 'm a full professor , you 're a graduate student . I 'm ordering you to stay . &nbsp; RAESieg heil . Yes sir . Aye aye , Captain . ( she salutes facetiously ) Am I now your prisoner , sir ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLThree mopalapal Indians were terminally ill , Miss Crane , now they are cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you will stay till Friday , I will prove it . Campbell pauses and looks at her . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( CONT 'D ) Will you stay ? &nbsp; RAEAre you asking me or telling me ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI 'm asking . ( pause ) Please , stay . Rae thinks then turns to her suitcase . &nbsp; RAEI 'll think about it . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWhat is this , god damn high school ? ! I want you to stay ! Please . Rae looks at him and thinks . &nbsp; RAEUntil Friday and no later . Campbell turns and starts out .  --  27  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLTomorrow night you can sleep in the shack . &nbsp; RAEHere 's fine . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThere 's better . Fewer bats . Campbell is gone . Rae looks around for bats . She sees some hanging upside down from the roof of the hut . &nbsp; RAEGreat . She sits on her cot and looks up . INT . CAMPBELL 'S SHACK , MORNING Rae is sitting on a chair . Campbell stands in front of her , giving her a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; RAEWhy are you doing this ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLIn 1500 there were nine million Indians in the Amazon , now there are two hundred thousand . Half the tribes that lived here at the turn of the century are now extinct . Wider please . &nbsp; RAEWhat does this have to do with my quarantine ? Rae opens wider . Campbell probes with his tongue depressor . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe Indians are unbelievably susceptible to outside diseases . Forty years ago the Brazilian government formed the Indian Protection Service . That organization systematically murdered the very same Indians it was charged to protect , by intentionally introducing smallpox , measles , flu , you name it , into the region .  --  28  --  &nbsp; RAEOh my god , that 's ghastly . Why did they do such a thing ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLLand , Miss Crain . Lumber . Minerals . Cattle . You name it . Unbutton a button please . Rae stares at Campbell . He wants her to unbutton a button on her blouse . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI 'm a doctor , Miss Crain . I 'm old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbuttons the top button on her blouse . He carefully puts his stethoscope on the top of her left breast and listens to her heart . It 's an intimate moment even though they both deny it . &nbsp; CAMPBELLYou 've had all your flu shots ? &nbsp; RAEYes . &nbsp; CAMPBELLPolio ? Typhoid ? Small pox ? &nbsp; RAEEverything . Want to see the needle marks on my butt - doctor ? Campbell removes the stethoscope . He stares at a defiant Rae . &nbsp; CAMPBELLHow about VD ? Any recent episodes ? &nbsp; RAEFor Christ 's sake , what do you take me for ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI take you for a young woman , Miss Crain . I wo n't insist on examining you but if any of these Indians come down with gonorrhea or herpes , I 'll know where they got it . &nbsp; RAE ( buttoning her blouse ) You are unbelievable .  --  29  --  Section Details EXT . THE JUNGLE , MORNING While Rae and Campbell stand around the fire , drinking coffee , Jahausa and Palala ( the one from the first scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by , carrying Rae 's things into the main shack . They both look at Campbell and Rae and smile , intimating that the doctor has found himself a woman . &nbsp; CAMPBELLJahausa , Palala , stop it . Jahausa mumbles something and makes a lewd gesture . He and Palala laugh . &nbsp; CAMPBELLEat it , Jahausa , do n't be ridiculous . Rotada . Bug off . Rotada . Rae frowns . Jahausa and his friend disappear into the shack , silently shooting each other suggestive looks , laughing . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI 'm sorry , Miss Crain , they 're out of line . &nbsp; RAEThey undoubtedly learned it from you . EXT . AN INDIAN VILLAGE , DAY The village consists of grass huts and thirty Indian tribesmen . A young woman , KALANA , twenty , sits patiently while Rae removes medical equipment from her suitcase . Palala , obviously Kalana 's husband , gingerly holds her hand . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( to Kalana ) ( Nawe ) , Kalana . Rae Crane ( Hosupa locata . Kopalada university United States . Nopalanda . Gehopo ka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalana 's stomach . &nbsp; RAEOf course you have no early x-rays showing her condition .  --  30  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLNo . But I have needle biopsies . Rae listens to the Kalana 's chest then puts away her stethoscope . &nbsp; RAEShowing me a " cured " patient proves nothing , Doctor . It 's the oldest scam in the book . &nbsp; CAMPBELLHow 's that ? &nbsp; RAEI go to a doctor , he tells me I 'm dying , but the good news is he knows a cure . Ten office visits , a few shots , and twenty thousand dollars later I 'm well , and he even takes x-rays to prove it . What he does n't tell me , of course , is that I 'm miraculously cured because all I had in the first place was the flu . &nbsp; CAMPBELLJust x-ray the girl , Miss Crane . If not for your own edification then for mine . I 'll show you the biopsies later . Rae begins setting up her small portable x-ray machine . The Indians watch with interest . EXT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rain forest to an outdoor laboratory he has set up . Jahausa and Palala pull back a tarp , revealing a large , homemade pen in which live dozens of cute and cuddly spotted animals that resemble guinea pigs . Campbell begins checking then . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe University 's so slow about sending me laboratory specimens , I 've had to raise them myself . He examines the guineas pigs , putting most of them back . Occasionally he finds something in an animal he 's looking for and puts that guinea pig in a box .  --  31  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLThis one 's a candidate . Feel him . Rae palpates the guinea pig 's neck with her hand . She nods . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIt 's easy to get the little buggers sick . Just feed them the same diet the Indians eat . He puts another two guinea pigs into boxes . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWhich is why you 'll be eating on the Campbell American plan : snake for breakfast , snake for lunch , buzzard for dinner . &nbsp; RAECharming . INT . CAMPBELL 'S SHACK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ashtray , napping . Rae peruses x-rays and paper work . Palala and Kalana look at the X-rays too , amazed . The Indians ca n't believe they are looking at pictures of a human skeleton . Rae puts her portable computer in the one spot on the table where there is no mess , and starts to make notes . Jahausa enters and puts a plate of food next to Rae . She looks at it . &nbsp; RAECampbell American plan ? Jahausa lights up . &nbsp; JAHAUSA ( nodding yes ) Yes . American plan . ( Gayup ) . He puts another plate next to the sleeping Campbell and exits . Rae eyes the food . DISSOLVE TO : INT . CAMPBELL 'S SHACK , LATE AFTERNOON Campbell is awake now , sitting in a chair , watching work . At each window , also watching , is just about every Indian in the tribe . Rae examines slide smears in the light and makes notes on the computer .  --  32  --  &nbsp; RAEWithout a full body cat-scan I ca n't be positive , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIncredible . &nbsp; RAEI still need proof , doctor . Scientifically repeatable proof . &nbsp; CAMPBELLFortunately none of the other Indians are sick at the moment . Did you biopsy the guinea pigs ? &nbsp; RAEYes . They 're on their last legs . Campbell opens a drawer and removes a small bottle of serum . &nbsp; CAMPBELLInject them each with this . Tenth cc per gram of body weight . ANGLE ON THE TABLE He snaps the bottle of serum onto the table . Into that he sticks a gleaming hypodermic needle . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details INT . THE SHACK , NIGHT Four cute guinea pits sit on a shelf in separate cages . Rae sits nearby , dressed in a nightgown , rubbing lotion into her feet . Campbell comes in and sees this . &nbsp; CAMPBELLLotion on your feet ? &nbsp; RAEWhy not ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLOut here ? &nbsp; RAEWhy not ? Just because you 've lost all touch with civilization does n't mean I have to .  --  33  --  She continues applying the lotion . Campbell shakes his head in disbelief then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CAMPBELLWhen I was in civilization , we called it going to bed . What is it called now ? &nbsp; RAEYou 're sleeping in here ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLIt 's my home unless that 's a problem . Rae stands up and unzips her mosquito net . She takes her pillow , puts on some slippers , and bundles up her things . Campbell stands watching . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWhere are you going ? &nbsp; RAEBack to the hut . &nbsp; CAMPBELLFor god 's sake , why ? &nbsp; RAEI prefer the bats . She heads out . EXT . THE CAMPSITE , NIGHT Carrying her bedclothes , Rae walks across the campsite towards the hut where she slept last night . Campbell catches up with her , carrying his own set of bedclothes . &nbsp; CAMPBELLGo back to the shack , I 'll sleep out here . &nbsp; RAEIt 's too late for chivalry . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIt has nothing to do with chivalry . I want you in there with those guineas . When you check them tomorrow , I want no doubts .  --  34  --  He moves past her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHACK , NIGHT Rae gets back into her bed , zips up the mosquito netting and lies down . Campbell enters and unzips the netting . &nbsp; RAENow what , doctor ? Campbell grabs the guinea pigs in their cages , and places them on the bed beside Rae . &nbsp; CAMPBELLMaking sure there are no doubts , Miss Crain . He zips down her mosquito net and walks to the door . Rae looks at the guinea pigs and thinks . She places them at the foot of her bed , readjusts the sheet over her body , and again tries to get comfortable amidst the guinea pigs ' constant cooing and squeaking . &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( at the door ) Sweet dreams . &nbsp; RAEFuck off . EXT . THE CAMPSITE , MORNING Campbell , Jahausa and Palala sit around , fixing the motor to an old compressor . Other natives move around the campsite doing their various chores . Inside the shack , Rae is up and dressed , working . &nbsp; JAHAUSAMiss Crain a pretty girl . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI know . &nbsp; PALALASmart too . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she no like you very much .  --  35  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLVery funny , Jahausa . Bug off . &nbsp; PALALAShe no like you to much , she ready for her doctorate ! ! Jahausa and Palala laugh hysterically . &nbsp; CAMPBELLEat it , both of you . You 're regular rain forest comedians . &nbsp; JAHAUSAShe make somebody a great wife . ( pause ) But not you ! Both Palala and Jahausa die laughing . Campbell shakes his head , reluctantly smiling . Rae comes to the door of the shack . &nbsp; RAEDr . Campbell . Campbell looks up . Rae walks back into the shack . Jahausa makes a motion that Campbell better hurry up and go . &nbsp; JAHAUSAShe calls , you better go ! &nbsp; CAMPBELL ( getting up ) Go fuck a monkey . Jahausa and Palala roll on the ground , laughing . INT . THE SHACK , DAY Rae is at the table with the guinea pigs . Campbell enters . &nbsp; RAEI do n't like being tricked , Dr. Campbell . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI beg your pardon ? Rae turns on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's impossible . Now what is going on ?  --  36  --  Campbell stands there for a moment then goes to a drawer and grabs an old bottle of cognac . He walks to Rae , puts two cups on the desk , and pours out two drinks . &nbsp; RAEWhat are you doing ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLCelebrating . He clinks the glass and waits for her to pick hers up . She does n't . &nbsp; CAMPBELLBy tonight their tumors will be half again and by tomorrow or the day after they will be gone . I 've found a cure for cancer , Miss Crane . Right here in this forest , where I always knew it would be . ( a toast ) Success . He downs his drink . Rae does n't . There is a long pause . Rae walks to the window . She looks down at the mess in the room and touches some papers idly . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIt 's not a trick . It 's not some switcheroo . You slept with the guineas , for god 's sake , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as another Indian gets sick , I 'll show you that it works on humans , too . Rae walks back from the window . She looks at Campbell . &nbsp; RAEI 'd like you to leave me alone . I 'd like to think . Campbell stares at her then leaves . Section Details EXT . THE CAMPSITE , AFTERNOON It is pouring down rain . Ear pounding rain , beating on the ground like a drum . Campbell sits under an outdoor thatch , sketching a drawing in a notebook . Jahausa , Palala , Kalana , and a few other of the Indians who live here sit around him under cover , sleeping . Rae comes out of the shack . She stands in the rain but that does n't seem to bother her . She looks transformed . In shock .  --  37  --  &nbsp; RAEI just re-examined the guineas . Long pause . &nbsp; RAEI believe you . ( pause ) We 'll need laboratory verification but basically I believe you . &nbsp; CAMPBELLGood . Rae walks to him and sticks out her hand . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . &nbsp; RAEIf I did n't find you so disgusting , I 'd hug you . &nbsp; CAMPBELLNo problem . We 'll pretend that you did . They release hands . &nbsp; RAEWhat 's in the serum ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI do n't know . &nbsp; RAEYou do n't know ? ! The Indians start to wake up . &nbsp; CAMPBELLCome with me . INT . THE SHACK , AFTERNOON Campbell and Rae stand in the shack . The rain is pounding on the roof . Outside the Indians get comfortable again and go back to sleep .  --  38  --  &nbsp; RAEWhat do you mean you do n't know ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI discovered it by accident and I have n't been able to make any more . &nbsp; RAEDid n't you keep records ? You 're a scientist , for god 's sake . You could n't have made a serum and not kept records ! You would n't have tested something on humans without records ! &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe Indians out here get cancer more frequently than any other people on the planet . Old , young , men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I came here . If I could determine why some got sick and why others did n't . Or why the animals who ate the same diet do n't get sick , then I might be able to isolate the anti-cancer agents in their environment . &nbsp; RAEThat 's perfectly good reasoning . Brilliant perhaps . But what has it got to do with your serum ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe human factor , Miss Crain . When a human being is dying , you do n't have time to proceed slowly and scientifically like you would on mice or guineas . &nbsp; RAEWhat did you do ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI made concoctions . Combinations of extractions , last ditch mixtures , anything I could think of with the slightest hope of saving lives . When one finally worked on the guinea pigs , I gave it to the Indians .  --  39  --  &nbsp; RAEDr . Campbell , you must have taken notes . &nbsp; CAMPBELLOf course . &nbsp; RAEThen why ca n't you simply duplicate those mixtures ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLI do n't know . God knows I 've tried . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've tried to recreate it , but it has n't worked again . &nbsp; RAEYou must have made a mistake . Look at the mess in here . &nbsp; CAMPBELLNo . I 'm sure about the basic ingredients . &nbsp; RAEThen how can you explain it ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLIf you 've studied the rain forest at all , you know that so many plant species look so much alike out here it 's uncanny . Maybe I 've been using the wrong sub-species of one of the plants . Or maybe one of the plants has changed chemistry as part of its life cycle . This is what I need you for . &nbsp; RAEThat could be like looking for a needle in a haystack . &nbsp; CAMPBELLMaybe . But it 's a small haystack . &nbsp; RAESmall ? You know as well as I that there are jillions of species out here .  --  40  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe serum was taken from plants from a two acre plot just before the waterfall . I 've got the land marked , I 've got notes on what I used . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no time . It has to be something simple . The mistake , I mean . Rae gets up and paces . She looks out , thinking . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThese Indians get cancer as often as we get colds . Others will be sick soon , and this is the last of my serum . Will you help ? Rae turns to Campbell . &nbsp; RAEWe should contact Dr. Ornega and tell him what 's going on . He can send out more researchers , and we can sort through this mess in half the time . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI do n't want you to tell Ornega anything . &nbsp; RAEWhy not ? The University has to be involved eventually . What do you have to lose ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLThese Indians . Their way of life . This forest . If you get white men swarming all over this area , these people will be gone from the face of the earth in a flash . &nbsp; RAEThat 's paranoid . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIs it ? &nbsp; RAEIt 's delusional.  --  41  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLObviously you have n't studied history . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a way of life with us . Stalin . Hitler ... Look at what we did to every Indian tribe in North America . &nbsp; RAEThat was a long time ago . The world has changed . The level of consciousness is different now . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIn Columbia , for the first time in that country 's history , a group of whites were brought to trial for murdering Indians . All toll sixteen Indians were murdered including seven children , but the Supreme Court acquitted the murderers on the grounds that they did not know that they were acting wrongly - because they did n't think their victims were human . Another time and another era , Miss Crain ? That was 1972 . Rae is shocked . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe white man does n't deserve a cure for cancer . Not at the expense of these Indians . Help me - alone - or not at all . Rae stares at Campbell . He puts the serum in a drawer . pp. 1-20 &nbsp; pp. 42-60 EXT . THE RAIN FOREST , MORNING Campbell leads the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek through the rain forest . At one point Jahausa points to a Jaguar sitting in a tree and instructs them to tread carefully . They do . EXT . THE CLOUD FOREST GORGE , MORNING This spot seems touched by magic . Almost holy . An ever present cloud hangs low in the air . In the background is the beautiful waterfall and gorge that Rae traveled through to get here .  --  42  --  In front of Campbell , Rae and the attending Indians is a roped off area about two acres big . One of the Indians , using a long pole , removes a giant , hissing snake . &nbsp; CAMPBELLGod 's little acre . Rae reacts to the snake . EXT . THE CLOUD FOREST GORGE , ANOTHER ANGLE , LATER Everyone stands back while Campbell shoots an arrow with a wire attached over the top of a tree . When the arrow comes down the wire hangs over tree limbs one hundred and twenty feet up . After Campbell attaches a special rig to the wire , he is able to climb the wire quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing stirrups and his hands in a pair of sliding hand clamps . Campbell shoots another wire up over the tree . &nbsp; CAMPBELLSeveral of the plants I used live in the canopy . ANOTHER ANGLE , HIGH IN THE TREE , LATER . Campbell climbs one set of wires , Rae climbs the other . Both are attached , mountaineer style , to a safety wire , but as they climb higher and higher , Rae is finding the altitude a little scary . Way down below , the Indians look like tiny bugs . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWould you like to rest ? &nbsp; RAENo thanks . The climb some more . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIf you 're afraid of the height , I can go alone . &nbsp; RAEEat it . She keeps climbing . ANOTHER ANGLE , THE CANOPY , LATER . Campbell and Rae are 100 feet up in the tree , hanging from the wires . It is a dizzying height .  --  43  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLSee those vine suckers ? &nbsp; RAE ( looking down through frightened eyes ) Uh huh . &nbsp; CAMPBELLAre you sure you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! Rae looks up to see a howler monkey , hanging from her wire , staring her right in the face . Rae screams . The monkey screams . Rae screams again . The monkey screams again , then leaps away . Rae looks at Campbell who is suddenly starts laughing hysterically . &nbsp; RAEThis is n't funny ! Campbell keeps laughing . &nbsp; CAMPBELLYou 're right . He keeps laughing . EXT . THE CLOUD FOREST FLOOR , LATER Rae sits off by herself eating lunch . Campbell sits with Jahausa and three other Indians , also eating , telling stories , laughing . Finally Rae has had enough of this . &nbsp; RAENow what 's so funny ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLSorry . Campbell and the Indians are still chuckling . &nbsp; RAEAre you going to be rude or would somebody care to let me in on it ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLSorry . It 's an Indian dirty joke . You would n't get it .  --  44  --  The Indians are still laughing , sides splitting . &nbsp; RAETry me . &nbsp; CAMPBELLWell .... Campbell pauses then looks at Rae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She woman . Uh ... &nbsp; CAMPBELLDo n't worry , she wo n't get it . ( he turns to Rae ) Mela no kolassa haft pota ela impalda ? He sits poised , waiting for her response . &nbsp; RAEWhat ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLYou do n't know ? ( then ) Haft palda ! Get it ? The Indians laugh again . So does Campbell . &nbsp; RAEOh that 's funny . That 's very funny . &nbsp; CAMPBELLI told you you would n't get it . Campbell and the Indians ' sides are splitting . Rae gets up . &nbsp; RAEMen are the same all around the world . She leaves Campbell and the Indians roaring in laughter . DISSOLVE TO : INT . THE RESEARCH SHACK , AFTERNOON Rae sits with Campbell at the work table , examining the plant cuttings that were gathered during the day .  --  45  --  &nbsp; RAEI ca n't believe the number of plant species out here .

The jungle noises are incredible . &nbsp; CAMPBELLForty thousand different kinds of birds . Two million species of insects . ( pause ) You know why I like it out here ? Wonder . Awe . That 's what they always leave out of science at the University . The things we study and codify and try to understand , even the simplest of things , are absolutely astounding . They listen some more . The jungle sounds are like a cacophonous symphony . Silently they go back to work sorting the plants gathered during the day . Campbell moves some papers to make room . &nbsp; RAEI 'll tell you something that 's amazing . ( pause ) There are more species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America .  --  46  --  Campbell smiles as Rae starts cleaning up .

Campbell and Rae are at opposite ends of the shack , working with slides and microscopes . &nbsp; CAMPBELLIt 's malignant all right . Sequacious Stage A. He looks at Rae who is comparing two x-rays of a guinea pig . &nbsp; RAENot a millimeter of shrinkage . The new serum 's useless . She turns off the light behind the x-rays and thinks . She turns to Campbell . &nbsp; RAEYou 've made a fine mess of this , Dr. Campbell . Campbell stands and walks to the table . He picks up the vial of the last of the working serum and an hypodermic .

The boy holds in the pain .  --  48  --  EXT . THE FOREST , NIGHT The Indian tribe , in full feathered headdress , is gathered in a circle around the boy , performing a ritual ceremony . Their faces are painted yellow and white and their bodies are painted red . The boy 's mother holds up the boy 's arm , feels under the boy 's arm , then calls joyfully . &nbsp; BOY 'S MOTHER ( Elala Hapala . ) Dr. Campbell ( rewatana ! ) Clearly overjoyed , the mother rushes over and hugs Campbell .

The Indians dance a ritual dance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they wipe a paste on their tongues , shudder , then they fall to the ground in a drug induced spasmodic frenzy . Others paint Campbell with paints . ANGLE IN THE SHACK Rae watches with amazement as the indians dance around Campbell . The Indians clearly accept him as one of their own and even revere him . Bark drums beat and the Indians chant . Tongue paste is offered to a now painted Campbell and he accepts it . He wipes some on his tongue and falls to the ground in a frenzy . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details EXT . THE SHACK , THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT Campbell lies on the ground , passed out in a heap beside the other Indians . The light is on in the shack . Campbell stirs and sees that Rae is up . Groggy from the jungle " medicines " , he nevertheless pulls himself to his feet and approaches the shack . Unseen by Rae , he peers in the window .

Ten years ! You do n't know what you 're dealing with ! &nbsp; RAEWhat am I dealing with ? &nbsp; CAMPBELLPeople who do n't give a damn about two scientists out in the jungle . People determined to cut these trees down no matter what the consequences . This entire sub-continent thinks these forests are an unlimited resource ! &nbsp; RAEHow can they think that ? All they have to do is look at a map . &nbsp; CAMPBELLJesus , are you really this naive ? He stops . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThe average Brazilian man insists on marrying a virgin .

Two soldiers aim their crossbows straight up Jahausa and Palala 's trees and fire . Two arrows , attached ropes trailing behind them like uncoiling snakes , shoot up and over the tree tops , then land down on the ground near the soldiers .

Campbell and Rae watch as does Kalana , anxiously . Jahausa and Palala , climbing higher and higher , watch too . ANGLE IN JAHAUSA 'S TREE The soldier , Rodriques , is only ten or so feet below the limb that Jahausa was sitting on . Because he climbs the trunk with his bare hands and feet , Jahausa 's progress is slower than the soldier 's . Jahausa sees the progress of his pursuer and gets an idea . He leaps onto Rodriques ' rope and climbs up it instead . &nbsp; RODRIQUESAlto ! Jahausa looks down at Rodriques then keeps climbing up . Rodriques tries to climb faster .

Rodriques and Kaliatin , yelling in vain for Jahausa and Palala to stop , follow . At one point Jahausa almost falls when a branch breaks off in his hand , but he steadies himself and keeps climbing . The two soldiers reach the tops of their ropes and pull themselves up into the canopy limbs too . They are not as adept or agile at this kind of climbing as the Indians but they continue up .

THE BULLDOZERS AND ROAD BUILDING EQUIPMENT , NIGHT Campbell , Rae , Renato and the helpers stand watching as the natives move at each piece of equipment , shaking fists and calling to their forest spirits , venting grief and anger . Using Indian paint , they paint two interlocking circles - an Indian symbol we 've seen in their rituals - on each piece of road equipment . ANGLE ON RAE AND CAMPBELL Sitting together in the woods , away from the others . Off in the distance , under the night waterfall , Kalana can be seen sitting with the newly planted sapling that covers her husband .  --  87  --  &nbsp; CAMPBELLThese Indians , in spite of their so called primitive natures - have the most highly evolved concept of marriage I 've seen . Because their models are the forest , where every individual lives only to fulfill another individual , the Mopalapal believe that no single person is in themselves complete . For them the words husband and wife both mean the same thing - intertwining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two strands that together are so much stronger than one , for the Mopalapal , once you are husband and wife you are the same person forever . Two trunks above ground , perhaps , but below ground , interwoven roots . The Indians marry without ceremony - and they are married in a word . For a Mopalapal the greatest honor another person can bestow is to call him " husband " or " wife " . Rae and Campbell watch Kalana in silence as she tends to the sapling tree . A bond is growing between the Rae and Campbell , an unspoken one based on trust and respect . She takes his hand . He lets her . But they do n't look at one another . Momentarily the other Indians file away from the bulldozers and road equipment . &nbsp; CAMPBELLThey 're bringing good luck offerings .
