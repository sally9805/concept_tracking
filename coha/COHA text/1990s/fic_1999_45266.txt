What if I had married you ? My husband claims that he rescued me . That I found the courage to leave you only after he ( my prince ) showed up . I do not believe this . I point out that , weeks before , I was able , completely on my own , to break out in a horrible rash that kept me in long sleeves in late August and made physical contact a subject not even open for discussion . <p> But what if Matthew was right , and I could not have ended it without him waiting in the wings ? And what if , on that sunny afternoon , when Matt stopped by to see if anyone on the girls ' side of the dorm could lend him a bicycle pump , I was , let 's say , in the bathroom ? <p> The college years are easy enough to imagine . The later ones would have been pretty much like the one I spent with you , except that things would have gotten progressively worse . You would have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my failure , despite all of our mutual effort , to be anything more than ordinary ; my lack of courage ; the noise I made when I swallowed . You would have continued to flatten me every time I tried to be funny , whenever I gave a bit too much detail in describing a dream or a movie plot , if ever ( oh God , let 's not even think about it ) you caught me picking a scab or my nose . And I do n't suppose I would have pointed out the irony of a person with my faults being the only reason you put up with this fucking joke of a place . The one reason you did n't throw some clothes and your ax in the car and just start driving . <p> Well , maybe I would have mentioned it-I am capable of anger too , you know-but you can bet that I would have chosen an appallingly inappropriate moment-when , for example , you were crouched before me naked , head bowed , forearms trembling with the force of your grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap to imagine us staying together after graduation . After four years with you I ca n't see myself exactly brimming with self-confidence ; somehow , I doubt I would have been champing at the bit to go it alone in a strange city . And do n't forget that you looked more than a little like Robert De Niro , that the guys on your floor followed you like a guerrilla band , that you were so smart you shut even my mother up . After all , I 'm not nuts . <p> Still-and here I believe I am on firm ground-I insist that I would not have married you right away . I am sure that it would have occurred to me that there are disadvantages to spending one 's life with a man who has even once looked at you with disgust . It would have taken a couple of years and a steady stream of wedding invitations . It would have required nights and weekends in a city where there was not a single person , except for you , who would have thought to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I tried to befriend someone from work-had I invited her and her husband to dinner-you would have steered the conversation onto the subjects of enormous rear ends and pretentious MIT-educated gnomes who were so full of bullshit their eyes were brown . And , yes , I would have realized that leaving you did not necessarily mean that I would have to eat alone in restaurants with my eyes glued to a newspaper , or spend my vacations in places like Buffalo and Rochester sleeping on an old school friend 's couch , or that the quality of my evenings would depend directly on what was on TV . <p> But what evidence would I have had to the contrary ? <p> The wedding would have been difficult . There would have been unpleasantness over the white dress . ( Who did I think I was ? Barbie ? ) And I would have gone through agonies wondering if you 'd really go on refusing to wear a tie or cut your hair . It is possible that I would have been seriously **26;0;TOOLONG , crying-in-the-shower depressed-but I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a joint in my parents ' basement , that there was n't a woman on this planet who would n't want to hang herself after spending a week at home , without sex , fighting with her mother over seating arrangements and who was going to transport the flowers to the synagogue . <p> Early married life-now that would have been fun . It was hard enough with a reasonable person . What would it have been like with the type of man who would tell you that he did n't care what the toilet he pissed in looked like and he was more than happy to eat pizza every night , so if you 'd rather clean and cook instead of reading or painting or making music that was your problem ; just do n't involve him . Of course , we both know that the one night that I decided , fine , and took only my clothes to the laundromat or prepared a single portion of spaghetti you would have gone berserk . You would have lashed me for my pettiness , questioning whether you could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand how a seemingly justifiable act could be an unforgivable assault in the context of an intimate relationship . <p> Now I ca n't say for sure that you would have been unemployed . I 'm only assuming this because I remember the kinds of jobs that were available for art majors in the late seventies . And because I can imagine your howls of frustration as you flung down the want ads ; your obscenities after a trip to the employment agency ; your refusal to speak , wash , or eat ( except for bag after bag of potato chips ) after you had signed up to take the civil service exam . What I ca n't imagine is how I , who would have been working at the paper by then , could have avoided coming to your rescue . After all , if you were the genius that most people took you for , a job in an office would have been as soul-killing as a life on an assembly line or in a tollbooth . If you were n't , what in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe while I wrote obituaries you would have created huge abstract sculptures or poetry . And maybe you would have found an agent and had a brilliant career , but for the sake of argument let 's assume that you would n't have . We 'll also assume that after a couple of years of coming home to you asleep on the couch , a hash pipe lying on a burn mark on the coffee table and roaches scampering down the pots in the kitchen sink-or maybe after just one early afternoon when I was home sick and I watched you shuffle in from the bedroom , eyes slits , hair clownish , not even looking as you slapped on the TV-I would have decided that if you wanted to be an artist it was going to be on your own dime . <p> The fights would have been horrific . But I would have had a surprise for you . I would not have backed down . <p> You would have fought with everything you had . You would have questioned how a person could criticize another person 's lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone three weeks without bathing or washing her hair , had on occasion made herself puke , had regularly tortured the slow-learner sister left in her care . You would have pulled out secrets that I had confessed in a post-sex frenzy of self-revelation , dirt that you had left alone for years , and still I would have kept repeating , slowly and calmly : I 'm sorry , but I will not support you . You 're going to have to get a job . You would have threatened to walk out , but by now I would have been promoted to the city desk and regularly riding home-gossiping , complaining , laughing at in-jokeswith a small , tight group of women reporters , so when the panic rose it would not have had quite the same momentum . <p> I do n't know what kind of job you would have found , but considering your qualifications I 'd say retail . Which would have meant six-day weeks , minimum wage , cameras aimed at the cooler to make sure you did n't help yourself to an ice tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high road , but I think it more likely that , one night , you would have let yourself into the apartment as usual ; gone in to change into sweatpants ; sat down to dinner ; and , chewing a mouthful of my spinach fettucini , inquired whether I found it a problem that today , because of me , you nearly had your head blown off by a kid robbing the register with a sawed-off shotgun . <p> What could I say ? Remember , I had won . <p> Still , you have to wonder whether , one morning , while I was brushing my teeth , or peeing in the ladies room after joking around ( maybe just the littlest bit flirtatiously ) with one of the new editors , or telling a visiting former colleague that , yes , my husband was still working at the convenience store , an idea would n't have popped into my head . An idle daydream that I could play with precisely because I did n't take it seriously , like quitting my job to drive cross country or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I guess that 's when you would have decided that perhaps it was n't , after all , against your moral code to use your intellect for a purpose from which I might possibly derive some benefit . <p> In other words , you probably would have taken your first computer course , aced it , and after a few more courses started sailing through a degree program . Who knows ? Maybe we would have begun socializing with some people you met at school , and if I did n't exactly like them I 'd still be excited by how much we were beginning to resemble an ordinary married couple . It 's even possible that you would have embarked upon a period of selfanalysis , discovering what an asshole you had been and how grateful you were for my forbearance , my good sense , my amazing ability to be , simultaneously , lover , mommy , psychologist , friend . And if none of this sat quite easy , and if your new-found adoration did not preclude you from admitting that you had always found my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartened when things were so much better than they had been ? <p> Besides , by the time you had finished school and had landed a position at a software firm , I would have hit thirty and begun feeling as if I would die if I did not have a baby soon . <p> I think the months of my pregnancy would have been our best time together . I can just imagine you sobbing over sonograms , scrubbing the tub after my bath , dropping to your knees in awe as I lay on my back , shirt lifted , to show you my undulating belly . I can see us shopping for wallpaper , trying out strollers , giggling hysterically over " Thor " and " Rufus " in the name-your-baby book-in other words , at last beginning the marriage that I had been promised by all those years of sixties TV . <p> Eventually , though , I would have given birth , and my guess is that , for a time at least , I would have had trouble noticing you at all . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who was living on my milk ; someone who , if I forgot about her , would die . A tiny creature who wore doll-sized stretchies and diapers that , when pulled from the box , fit into the palm of my hand . There 's no way that I could have worried about the needs of a grown man in a world that was full of baby , in which I was experiencing baby skin and baby smell , in which life before motherhood seemed like a wan , unformed pseudolife . <p> My guess is that you would not have found this to be a particularly welcome development . I also doubt that being scared and woken up a lot would have made you especially kind when , after the fourth feeding in one night , I collapsed beside the crib , weeping about the responsibility , the exhaustion , my terror over how much my life was going to change . I think it more likely that you would have asked me why , then , did I drive you fucking nuts until you agreed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason this kid was constantly crying was because she sensed all my fucking angst . I imagine that we would have quickly progressed to a screaming fight , in which you would have pointed out every single thing I was doing wrong , and I , already half-mad with worry that one mistake would rob my child of the perfect start in life , would have decided that you were pure evil . <p> And then I would have panicked . <p> I would have just had a baby , for God 's sake . I would have been still wearing maternity clothes . How could I have considered raising and supporting a child on my own if I had not yet fathomed how to click in the carseat or untangle the Snugli ? If I was so stupefied from sleeplessness I was spending my mornings , baby in lap , watching reruns of Little House on the Prairie and Dick Van Dyke ? <p> I think it more likely that I would have made a sincere effort to give you the benefit of the doubt . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipes because , Christ , how hard can it be watching a baby sleep all day ? Or if , later , you walked in on my mothers ' group and asked with a broad smile : So who says that having a kid reduces a woman 's IQ by half ? I would have reminded myself that I had once felt that way too and then made damn sure that you overheard no more conversations about sugar-free alternatives to Cheerios or catalogues offering great buys on 100 per cent cotton . I also would have kept my mouth shut if you banged off the TV because you would not-did I hear you ? - would not have this shit on in your house , and from then on I would have kept an eye on the clock when the afternoon preschooler programs were on , would have remembered to pop out the sing-along tape in case you decided to take my car , and would have driven home from Toys R Us , saying over and over to a child who could not yet speak : Remember , remember , Mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes home from work . <p> Eventually it would have fallen apart . Maybe when I began thinking about returning to work part-time . Because I can just imagine you saying nothing as I cried at the thought of my child being looked after by someone who , no matter how kind and giving , did not love her ; saying nothing as I spent weeks visiting various providers of child care ; saying nothing as I rose two hours early to shower , dress , feed her , reassure her , and pack her stuff ; and then-as I stood in the doorway , bag on shoulder and child on hip , barely able to breathe in my pre-pregnancy work skirtsaying sadly , head shaking with disbelief : You 're really going to do this , are n't you ? <p> That 's when it would have ended . Not literally of course . Because what kind of fool , what kind of loser , would stick with a man through all those years , through all that shit , and then leave him after she had a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with hers in a lovely neighborhood , speeding their Little Tikes cars like tiny Fred Flintstones or scooping water from wading pools on lawns riotous with plastic pails , Disney towels , and sunscreen tubes ? It would have been too much to contemplate . But , still , even if the timing was vague , even if nothing could have been done until my daughter had enough happy childhood under her belt to guarantee a well-adjusted adulthood , I would have known that eventually you would be out of my life and I only had to endure you until that time came . <p> Now , I would have been smart to have merely arranged things so that we saw you less and less-planning weekend outings with friends at the aquarium ( or at McDonald 's followed by story time at the library ) , spending every vacation with the grandparents , who , I could have pointed out reasonably enough , you could n't stand anyway-but I know myself . Secretly , I would have been constantly waiting . No doubt I would have let a million opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miserable shit not even a saint could have resisted , and then I would have informed you , voice low and sad , eyes slits of hate , that I felt nothing for you . That you could be hit by a car , you could get cancer , and I would not care . <p> That , I think it is safe to say , would have been a mistake . The thought of you wounded brings the phrase , a whole new ball game , to mind . What I mean is that there is a big difference between living with a man who belittles by instinct and one who , through shock and grief , has become so thoroughly your enemy he gauges the merit of every word and act on the basis of whether it will cause you pain . <p> Maybe that seems paranoid , but I would have known-would have known-that if you stopped , while driving home from the daycare center , to buy our child ice cream it was because , just the day before , she and I had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you came back emptyhanded from the bakery , insisting that I had said that I would call in the order , it was for the pleasure of seeing my face as I watched the first of eleven four-year-olds arriving for a party with no birthday cake . If you sent our daughter across the lawn , giggling and glancing back , to put the daddy longlegs on Mommy 's shoulder , it was so that I would leap up shrieking and batting myself wildly and you could upbraid me for obviously wanting our child to be as phobic about bugs as I was . <p> I would have been speechless . At least until we were someplace public , like our daughter 's preschool It 's Spring ! concert , and you made some snide remark about the way that I had dressed her or the inadequate attention that I paid to her hair . That , no doubt , is when I would have chosen to become hysterical , carrying on like a madwoman until some parent next to me decided that anyone who so blatantly violated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hissed shh ! I probably would have spent the remainder of the performance unable to move , conscious of nothing but my own blasting body heat , and then , on the way out to the parking lot , I would have informed you that I truly believed that if I had a gun right now I would kill you with it . My guess is that I would have gone completely off my rocker on the drive home , screaming about how you had turned my life into a pile of shit , and how there was nothing left of this marriage , nothing , and by the way the thought of you touching me made me physically ill , and I no doubt would have continued in this vein as you pulled into our driveway , as I stalked around the car to open the back door , and up to the point where I stepped into the light of the porch and saw the look on my child 's face . <p> And then , like the scarecrow at the end of The Wizard of Oz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have felt it breaking . <p> What next ? I can only hope that I would have spent the hours of that same night in imaginary argument , refining each point , anticipating every possible counterattack , and that the next morning , after our daughter had been safely deposited at her friend 's next door , I would have gone to you , calmly and without bitterness , and explained why it was clearly ridiculous for us to go on living together . I would have had an airtight case . After all , if I had ruined your life , if I was a poisonous bitch who had destroyed every loving , generous impulse you had ever had , well then ! There would have been no reason on this earth for you to have refused me a divorce , except that it was something that I wanted , which is why you no doubt would have treated me to a long contemptuous stare and then replied : Fine , no problem , do what you need to do , as long as you understand that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , I suppose , would have been the beginning of my migraines . Or perhaps low-back pain so disabling that I could not work . Or maybe it would have been gastric upsets that sent me to the emergency room , certain that I was having a heart attack . In any case , I ca n't believe that I would have retained much interest in my weight or the state of the house or getting dressed . You , of course , would have reacted with your usual generosity , perhaps guessing , upon catching me in front of the open refrigerator , that it was easy for a person to keep on eating when she was spared the sight of her own ass . I imagine that you would have felt enough concern over my wine consumption to share it with my boss or our child 's teacher and that you would have found my inability to get out of bed so distressing you would have been forced to yank me out by the arm , drag me down the stairs , and lock me out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Probably . I 'm not talking about a broken jaw or cracked ribs-nothing in my makeup would have tolerated that . But I think it likely that on a few occasions , perhaps when I had responded to your insults with particular listlessness , you would have punched me in the shoulder or shoved me backwards against the sharp edge of the kitchen counter . I 'd also guess that the next time that I saw one of those battered-women exposes on TV I would have looked about the bedroom , probably now littered with clothes , dirty dishes , and balled-up Kleenex , and then down at my own tee shirt , spotted with toothpaste and dried egg , and I would have felt like one of those sci-fi-show characters who wakes up on a bizarre , sinister planet without the slightest idea of how he got there . <p> But this I know . <p> One morning when you were at work or , better still , out of town for a couple of days , I would have gotten up and I would have called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have explained my situation to him until I was unable to talk because of the crying , and my brother-who lives on the other side of the country and who , quite frankly , has problems of his own-would have come . My brother would have come and he would have sat on my couch , with my child in his lap and his face grim , waiting to beat the shit out of you as I galloped about packing like Prissy in Gone with the Wind . Then my brother would have taken me to the bank and sat double-parked , as alert as any driver of a getaway car , while I emptied out our joint savings account . <p> Would I have ever married again ? With a kid and wrinkles already starting under my eyes ? Fat chance . And what of my daughter ? Would she have faced years of therapy ? Would she have spent her life getting involved with the wrong men ? I do n't know . I do n't know . I do n't know . But what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of my youth , maybe the guilt over my child would have tortured me to my dying day , but wherever you are , whether you read this or not , I want it to be perfectly clear that in the end-in the end , you bastard , you sadist , you sonuvabitch-in the end , I would have gotten away . <p>
