<p> TORONTO 'S dumps are full to overflowing . Of the two sites used by the city , one will close this summer , the other by middle of 1993 , maybe earlier . <p> " We 're in a crisis , " says George Kelly , director of solid-waste management for Metropolitan Toronto , a city of more than 3 million residents . " And those closing dates are predicated on Toronto handling only our own solid waste . Peel ( an adjoining county ) fills up this summer , so if we take theirs , the sites will fill sooner . " <p> Neighboring towns do n't want the city 's garbage . But Canada 's biggest city did manage to persuade some hard-pressed northern mining towns to take its garbage . <p> The solution ? Put 4,000 tons of compressed garbage on a unit train ( specially built railroad cars ) every day and dump it into an abandoned mine site at Kirkland Lake in northern Ontario , 375 miles north of Metropolitan Toronto . In return for accepting 30 million tons of garbage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as C$450 million ( $388 million ) in benefits . <p> That 30 million tons translates into one long train every day for 20 years . At the other end of the 12-hour trip it would dump the garbage into an abandoned , open-pit iron-ore mine . It is a round hole in the ground , about half a mile wide and 600 feet deep . <p> The garbage does n't go straight into the pit . There would be a recycling plant built there - at a cost of up to C$40 million ( $34.4 million ) - to extract the valuable bits . And pumps will be used to stop liquid waste from contaminating the water table . <p> But environmentalists say shipping the garbage north is the wrong solution . It is a waste of energy and it distracts people from what the environmentalists call the three R 's of garbage : reducing , reusing , and recycling . And they say if people in the city have to live with their garbage , they might learn to control it . <p> " Metro Toronto has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Kirkland Lake deal is designed to allow the binge to continue , " says David McRobert of Pollution Probe , a Toronto-based ecological lobbying group . <p> The Kirkland Lake dump plan has been agreed to by authorities in Toronto and Kirkland Lake . It now has to be approved by the province and faces an environmental assessment hearing . <p> There are other problems , especially with toxic runoff from rotting garbage leaching into the water table . <p> " Mine sites are usually unsuitable because there is water running into them , " says environmental consultant Colin Isaacs , who has visited the Kirkland Lake site . IN spite of environmental objections , the dumping plan seems almost certain to go ahead since there is n't much choice . The old mine could be accepting Toronto 's garbage by 1994 , just as the other dumps are full . <p> But there is opposition . In a letter to the province protesting the plan , Pollution Probe , an environmental group , said : " Garbage export encourages an ' out of sight , out of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate polluter from their pollution because they have no incentive to change their ways . " <p> Pollution Probe also says it is a waste of energy to ship material to a recycling facility so far away from where it will be reused . <p> Shipping garbage a long distance away from cities has been tried in some European countries , but this is a first for a Canadian city . It will cost about C$30 ( $25.9 ) a ton to use trains to bring the garbage north , about twice what it costs now to bring it to nearby dump sites . <p> But the idea is to ship less garbage . That means government control and regulations on recycling , fewer garbage pickups , and a plan to cut back on the use of junk mail . <p> " Ontario already has the largest and probably the most advanced recycling program in North America , " says Mr. Isaacs . Called the Blue Box program , it allows more than 2 million households to put out newspapers , cans , and bottles in blue boxes supplied by municipalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidizing the use of backyard composters so that people can get rid of kitchen scraps . While food waste may seem benign , it rots and creates methane gas , making landfill sites and dumps unstable . <p> " Take the problem garbage out before shipping it to the dump , " says John Angus , who was one of the inventors of the Blue Box program and is now president of Eco Consulting Services in Toronto . " The best way is to get people to compost . There is very little cost and it gets rid of bad stuff ( food waste ) before it gets to the dump . " <p> Mr. Angus estimates there are as many as half a million households using composters in Ontario . In some municipalities , the provincial government pays for half the cost of a backyard composter to encourage reducing waste . <p> And there is a proposal to cut back on junk mail , much of which is tossed away without even being opened . The solution : Raise the price of bulk mail from the present 9 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents . Or find a way to recycle the paper it is printed on and mailed in . <p> Shipping garbage in Canadian winters causes technical problems . It freezes and sticks to the inside of the railway car . And the road to Kirkland Lake is long and cold . While Toronto is relatively balmy by Canadian standards - average January temperature is 27 degrees F. - Kirkland Lake is cold even by Siberian standards . In January the average temperature is 3 degrees F. and it is not uncommon for it go down to 40 below zero and stay there for a few weeks . Experts are working on this problem . At the end of last year , four garbage trucks , each laden with 10 tons of Toronto rubbish , made the 250-mile trip down the TransCanada highway to Ottawa . There at the National Research Council , the garbage was put in a deep freeze to study what happens to it during transport under bleak winter conditions . <p> " The test was done for CP Rail to see if garbage in containers could be discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Research Council . " The test site is so big we can put an entire rail car in there and freeze it . " <p> The job is to figure out an easy way to thaw it when it gets to Kirkland Lake . The rail cars will have to be custom-made for unloading frozen garbage . <p> CP Rail says it has tested two types of garbage car . " One , called a ram , uses a moving partition to force out the garbage . The other , called a walking floor , employs a series of aluminum floor slats that shuffle back and forth . The shuffling ejects the load , " says Len Cocolocchio of CP Rail in Montreal .
