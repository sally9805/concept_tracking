<p> The time has come to look for new ways to get people who live outside of Atlanta to pay their fair share of Atlanta 's upkeep . <p> Unlike with the ludicrous Public Service Commission plan for Southern Bell to include so many counties in the non-toll Atlanta calling zone , I applaud Department of Transportation Director Wayne Shackleford 's long-range vision of moving toward lower-polluting and economically sound commuter rail systems . <p> But is this enough ? Why do n't we have special parking fees and permits for Atlanta non-residents , as in Boston and parts of Seattle ? Permits could be handed out to city residents at the same outlets as voter registration cards , such as public libraries . <p> An annual permit for non-residents to park on Atlanta streets could be $25 . Out-of-state vehicles and rental cars would be exempt so we would not hurt our ailing tourist and convention industry . <p> Just consider all of the people who came to the Dogwood Festival and pot rally at Piedmont Park recently . <p> Cars with license plates from Cobb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metro counties used our street parking , parks , police services and lavatories , all provided free . <p> What 's the sense of saving Piedmont from a sewage plant , if we just trample it to death with no financial support from non-city residents of the metro area to keep up the lawns and greenery ? <p> Also , why are non-Atlanta businesses allowed to do business in Atlanta without a city permit ? Any person providing a service in Atlanta should have to obtain the same permit that an Atlanta-based business is required to pay for . <p> We 've given up on Cobb and Gwinnett ever providing support for MARTA , but we need to find innovative ways to finance Atlanta 's budget before the Super Bowl and Olympics come to town , causing even more financial burdens for Atlanta residents and businesses . <p> The Constitution 's attempt to vindicate U.S. Rep. John Lewis ( D- Atlanta ) in the April 18 editorial " Much ado about banks " is as deceitful as Mr. Lewis . <p> He said he could n't remember having bounced 125 checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poor , he is not qualified for public office . <p> As for the editorial 's contention that " no public funds were involved " in the operations of the bank , how does the editorial writer think the bank was run ? Was n't it mismanaged by some of the thousands of bureaucrats employed by Congress at public expense ? <p> They enabled congressmen to enjoy interest-free loans and avoid penaltiies of the sort imposed by commercial banks on overdrafts . If there was nothing wrong , why did public exposure force the bank 's closing ? <p> This scandal reflects the fiscal irresponsibility through which the Democratic Congress has hung a debt of more than $3 trillion around the necks of U.S. taxpayers . <p> Jan Gerhorsam 's April 10 article , " Newspapers criticized for triggering Ashe 's revelation , " demonstrated the lows to which our media will sometimes go to get a scoop . <p> The media love to champion their Firss Amendment rights to print the truth . <p> But in this case , the individual 's right to privacy was trampled on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashe 's . <p> Arthur Ashe is not a publicly elected official , in fact , he was no longer n the public spotlight . Whether or not he has AIDS is not any of our business . <p> I wonder whether if Ashe had been battling another disease , such as cancer or diabetes , if the media would have batted an eyelash . The sad truth is that AIDS sells papers , and in this case , that was all that seemed to matter . <p> It is unfortunate that the race for labor commissioner between incumbent Al Scott and former Secretary of State David Poythress has turned into a matter of race . <p> This says that after all this time , we have yet to learn to live together as a people accepting and respecting all of our differences . <p> There is no place for racism in a civilized society and certainly no place for it when choosing those people who hold themselves out for public service . <p> Until we learn to judge people on the content of their character and not by the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove to ourselves that we yet have a long way to go and that we are not the people who we think we are . <p> Predictably , the intellectually arrogant William Safire in a recent column would seek to persuade us that the outrage of average citizens is a " waste , a fraud and an abuse . " <p> He describes this outrage as misdirected but offers no alternative targets for our feelings . <p> Rather he describes as " simpletons " those who are beginning to think Ross Perot may have an approach that could start our nation on a path toward recovery and sanity . <p> We " simpletons " are getting tired of hearing that only experts in compromise are suited for the responsibilities of government , and that corporate types have no experience in governing . <p> Most corporate executives find that the higher one goes on the ladder , the more time is spent presiding while diverse ideas are presented for solving problems and moving ahead . <p> If only simpletons are outraged at the seeming paralysis of government , the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms deals and the Council of Competitiveness , I would prefer to be one than belong to the National Press Club . <p> One can imagine Mr. Safire in a previous life as a Press Spin Doctor for Marie Antoinette saying , " Hey Marie , just tell ' em to eat cake . " <p> I deal directly with feeding , lodging and general assistance of those on the streets . I am a businessman who puts his money where his mouth is , quietly . <p> Much of the April 19 special section on how churches are helping the homeless was wasted on newsprint rather than telling the people of this city the truth . <p> One day this month I counted 250 people in the church food line . Seven were white . This tells me that white church organizations are serving with money and time where there is not one black church set up where the real problem lies , on downtown streets . <p> When those churches assume their responsibility dealing with their own people the situation will change dramatically . It is not just giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of status quo . <p> It is n't easy for white volunteers to preach gospel where blacks mostly want their own style of faith . Black churches simply are not down here where things are happening and where the largest burden lies . <p> Jimmy Carter is very close to finding all this out and when he does he 'll call things as they are . Black churches simply are not in the trenches . I often wonder why I am.
