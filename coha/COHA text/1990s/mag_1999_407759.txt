FACING UP TO BALDNESS IS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN a man 's life . " Many men see losing their hair as the first sign that they wo n't be young forever , " says Georgia Witkin , Ph.D. , a clinical professor of psychiatry at Mt . Sinai Medical College in New York and author of the best-selling book The Male Stress Syndrome ( Newmarket Press ) . " It can be a deeply stressful , sometimes even shocking experience for men . It can affect their self-esteem , their relationships and even their careers . Most men do n't talk about it or do anything about it , which just adds to the stress . " THE STAGES OF MOURNING New York couples therapist Jane Greer , Ph.D. , says that many men go through a series of phases , a la Elisabeth Kibler-Ross , regarding hair loss . " First there 's shock , the feeling that this ca n't be happening to him , " she says.The next phase-denial-is manifested by the comb-over . After denial comes anger-and a sudden , passionate interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you are bald ; ' explains Greer . Finally , with luck ( and a dollop of sympathy from your mate ) comes acceptance , accompanied by a determination to do something constructive , whether that means adjusting to your baldness or seeking medical help.This can be an emotional turning point : NewYork psychologist Stanley Teitelbaum , Ph.D. , says that the renewed self-confidence brought about by addressing hair loss can enable a man to move ahead both personally and professionally Sadly , many men never reach this point . " They wonder if it 's really OK to take a pill or get a transplant , " says Greer . " Cosmetic surgery is n't something men talk about over lunch . We need to normalize their options . " These are as follows : PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES On the medical front , a relatively new approach is the drug Propecia , on the market since early last year . It works by inhibiting the enzyme that produces dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , the male hormone associated with baldness . Merck reports that in clinical trials Propecia stopped hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regrowth in 66 percent . " Propecia has made quite a difference in our planning for our patients , " says David Orentreich , M.D. , a noted Manhattan hair-loss and transplant specialist . He prescribes Propecia-which costs about $50 a month-to halt the spread of baldness , in conjunction with micrograph surgery ( see below ) . The catch is , you 're taking on a life sentence with this drug : if you stop taking it , the hair it helped grow or preserve falls out . And only time will tell what Propecia 's long-term effects may be . Check with your doctor about side effects . ( Women should not take or handle Propecia , and Propecia users should wear condoms during intercourse to protect their partners from exposure to the drug . ) The old standby , of course , is topical minoxidil ( Rogaine ) , now an over-the-counter drug . Used twice daily for several months , the drug wo n't create new hair , but it can stop hair follicles from shrinking and stimulate dormant follicles to produce new hair ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . As with Propecia , Rogaine requires a lifetime commitment . Small wonder that many men would rather consider a transplant . SURGERY Hair-transplant surgery has improved enormously , and the potted-plant forehead may be a thing of the past . Dr. Orentreich , whose father Dr. Norman Orentreich pioneered the transplant in the 1950s , asserts that with smaller grafts ( only one or two hairs per graft ) , a natural look is attainable . " We try to achieve a density that to the experienced eye looks like what a patient would have at his stage of life , " Dr. Orentreich says . " We can do everything for some men , and partial work for others . " Success ultimately depends on the surgeon 's ability to envision a man 's future pattern of balding and to execute the transplant in a way that ensures that the transplanted follicles wo n't end up sprouting in solitary splendor after the hairline has receded past them . " In my mind , when I first see a new patient , I construct a plan for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation is performed under local anesthesia . Two transplant sessions ( which take two to three hours and usually cost between $2,000 and $5,000 each ) are generally required . HAIR PIECES The technology of hairpieces and hair weaves ( in which real or artificial hair is glued or woven into your real hair ) has improved . Still , there are disadvantages.A weave , which costs $1,000 to $4,000 , wo n't blow off in the wind . But it does require a one-and-a-half- to two-hour adjustment session every four to five weeks to compensate for the growth of your real hair . Additionally , a weave can greatly stress your hair follicles if it 's tied too tightly . ( A quick rule of thumb : if you ca n't wrinkle your brow , your hair is at risk . ) A toupee , which costs about the same , comes off at night-and sometimes in the wind . Neither is very sexy . Perhaps the biggest drawback is the aversion many women feel . " I just saw a man wearing a bad toupee , " says NewYork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be better than what he sees in the mirror in the morning . " ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING Her words sum up women 's almost unanimous opinion about baldness : that a frank , open self-acceptance is preferable to an unsuccessful cover-up , whether in the form of a toupee or the dreaded comb-over . " I think all women will agree on the ' strands ' look , " says Mary Buffett , coauthor of Buffettology , a book about the investment strategies of her former father-in-law , Warren Buffett . " If he 's spreading his hair from one side to the other , it 's a turnoff . " Just as off-putting , women say , are open expressions of " hair anxiety . " Jeannette Walls , who writes MSNBC 's on-line column " Jeannette Walls Delivers the Scoop , " recalls dating a man who would disappear into the bathroom for long intervals . " He 'd emerge patting his head and reeking of hair spray , " she says . " It signaled a lack of integrity . Baldness can be virile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recommends bowing to the inevitable : " A balding man should crop it short and go with the bullet look . " ( But try telling that to a man who 's in the denial phase . NewYork hair stylist Kim Lepine remembers trying , for months , to gently persuade an otherwise handsome man to let her shear the monkish tufts above his ears . " But it 's the only hair I have ! " he pleaded . ) BALD CHIC Walls urges men to move beyond self-acceptance to self-approval . " They should take a cue from those handsome black ballplayers who 've spearheaded bald pride , because they are voluntarily bald . " Her words reflect an ironic reality : now that hair loss is almost optional for men with the financial resources and the will to prevent it , baldness is becoming fashionable . " I used to predict that baldness would be the look of the Nineties , " says Cary Gries , a film editor at Progressive Image Group in New York . " I was right , thanks to Michael Jordan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade 's most attractive men must include the proudly bald Jordan , Anthony Edwards , Sean Connery , Billy Zane , Andre Braugher and architect Charles Gwathmey , frequently cited for his combination of close-cropped hair and suntanned good looks . // The decision to close-crop or shave your head is very personal , with a significance far deeper than mere cosmetic considerations.When Gries decided to shave his head , in 1993 , he says , " It was a little scary . It was saying good-bye to my fear of looking like my father . But , " he adds , " I 've had more attention from women since.Women look into a man 's eyes . " Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia agrees . " For a woman , it 's a man 's wit and charm that count . " There 's plenty of evidence to back him up : Fred Astaire , Bob Hope , Sir Winston Churchill and Yul Brynner were too charming to need a lot of hair . So is Mikhail Gorbachev . " He has charisma and character . He 'd look funny with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor and publisher of Chicago 's Date Book newsletter . IT 'S NOT WHAT YOU 'VE GOT , IT 'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT Some men learn to make the most of their other attractions . " The biggest change was when somebody said , Do n't comb your hair that way . ' Now what I 've got goes straight back , " says Tim Clark , Winnie 's stockbroker husband . He also sports blue shirts that he says are far more becoming to his complexion than white would be . Many men who are losing hair also lose hope and allow themselves to become sloppy , but Jeffrey D. Podolsky , a senior editor at George magazine and beau of baroness and NewYork bon vivante Milly de Cabrol , knows that the secret is to do just the opposite . He works out regularly and goes in for stylish , English-cut suits with bold ties and Turnbull &; Asser shirts  --  a look de Cabrol calls " very chic . " A securely balding man wins more than women 's approval ; he also gains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gries was once stopped outside a club by a man who said , " I admire you for being able to go out in public like that . " The fellow was wearing a toupee-a bad one , Gries chuckles . In the end , a man 's ultimate vindication must come from an inner sense of self-approval . As Prince Dimitri triumphantly sums up , quoting a famous line : " God made a few perfect heads , and the rest he covered with hair . " <p>
