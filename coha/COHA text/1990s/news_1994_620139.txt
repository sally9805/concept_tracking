<p> The body is liquid . It must be . There can be no physiological explanation for the way it leaps into the air heading one direction and then ends up somewhere else . Sometimes it seems to break into pieces , with bends and angles where none previously existed , an arm attached to a ball materializing out of a mass of limbs , disconnected from the frailties and limits of human elasticity . <p> The body transforms itself , adapting to the situation . Big defenders step up to cut off the lane or alter the shooting arc . The body responds , changing direction to sift through thicker-legged opponents , lifting itself as high as necessary . You look for props or wires or something plausible to explain how Warriors guard Latrell Sprewell mocks gravity . <p> We want to know how it feels to jump like that , to contort like that , to leave reason behind and improvise in the air . We want to know how it feels to take off first and decide later . <p> We want to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods and rhythms of the game , to know in a fraction of a millisecond what the other guy will do and when he 'll do it . How many times have you said it : Just once . Just one trip down the court . Just one jump . <p> We need someone to let us in , to put words to the music . <p> Sprewell ca n't help . Or wo n't . The mind is closed to trespassers . The life is barred at the gate , no intercom in sight . We are left forever outside the mansion . The physical evidence is the word , the explanation , all you 'll get . <p> " It 's just playing basketball , " he says . " I take the game seriously , but just because I do something the fans or reporters think is great does n't mean I think it 's great . When you 're doing something you do all the time , you do n't stop and think about it . It 's just what I do  --  play basketball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being watched . In their eyes you see the foreman standing in the background assessing performance , pulling a pencil from behind an ear to mark a grade on a clipboard . Those are the ones who play tentatively , the gears grinding into place , the important thoughts taking place during the act , not before . Those are the ones left behind . <p> Sprewell plays as if there is no one else around , just an empty court with nine other guys as highly paid obstacles . He and Tim Hardaway  --  find a better backcourt in the NBA ; you ca n't  --  play with the same jazz-riff spontaneity , apparently answerable only to themselves . There is nothing self-conscious about anything either player does on the court . <p> Hardaway is full of words . They run like water through a broken hull . He calls Sprewell " a great player  --  team , individual , whatever . A great player . On the court , it 's his call . " <p> Off the court , forget it . Some guys are starving for attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings on a riot of self-promotion , endorsements , deals , trash talk , demands for trades , demands for two-year outs or one-year outs or anytime outs , Sprewell goes out of his way to remain a puzzle . <p> " Guys are different , " he says . " That 's just my personality . That 's me . I 'm not really excited about any of this . " <p> Do n't call the family back in Milwaukee or Flint , Mich. , he says politely . He 's not interested in life stories . <p> Do n't worry about any of that . <p> Just watch the game . <p> * <p> The smart move was to slow it down and set up the offense . The smart move was to realize that three of the New York Knicks ' larger mastadons  --  the ones yet to make it back on offense  --  were waiting near the basket when Sprewell stole the ball . <p> One on three ? Sprewell sees even odds . It is the Warriors ' way . He dribbled toward the foul line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mastadons were helpless , their feet nailed to the floor , their mouths open . Sprewell went up between them and among them , flicking the ball off the fingertips and into the hoop . <p> Not a smart move ? Maybe not for somebody else . <p> " He amazes me , no doubt , " Hardaway says . " He does things that amaze me . Not just that he can do them , but that anybody can . " <p> Asked if any of the improvisation surprises him , if he ever does something even he ca n't believe , Spre- well says , " Never . " <p> Says Warrior coach Don Nelson : " The thing about Sprewell is , he plays defense every night . And anything he gets on offense  --  only 27 or so points  --  is a plus . " <p> Sprewell winces at the inevitable comparison , and he is right : Michael Jordan has become a cliche . The comparisons are meaningless , and somehow degrading , strange as that sounds . It 's almost like comparing someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inscribed stone , resting in its commercialized , undisputed glory . But to bring it up , to constantly search for The Next , is an exercise in mental laziness . <p> " I 'm being myself , " Sprewell says . " Nobody 's ever going to be him . " <p> * <p> Gene Bess was one of the first to see all this happen . He coaches at Three Rivers Community College in Poplar Bluff , Mo. , where Sprewell first showed the signs that made him first-team All-NBA in his second year in the league . <p> Three Rivers is an unlikely place for a city kid from Milwaukee to end up . A call to the Poplar Bluff Chamber of Commerce answered all the pertinent questions : The rivers are the St. Francis , the Current and the Black ; it 's about 150 miles south of St. Louis in the middle of the Ozark Mountains ; the basketball team at Three Rivers is a huge source of civic pride . <p> " We do n't have many black people here , " said John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in has to be the right kind of kid . He has to be one who is willing to take some authority . Gene finds the right one who 's willing to work with him . Sprewell 's a good example . Some ca n't handle it . " <p> Even over the telephone , some 1,500 miles away , it 's safe to assume this Ozark basketball factory is an odd thing . <p> " I found this Nigerian floating around over here with nowhere to go , " Bess says , his voice injected with sudden enthusiasm . " I just brought him in here and he blossomed . He 's my star now . You 'll be hearing about him . " <p> It 's hard to picture a tall Nigerian teen-ager walking aimlessly through the streets of Poplar Bluff , but apparently they 're out there . You just have to know where to look . <p> " There are ways to get guys , " he says . " Some of it 's luck ; I 've been blessed . " <p> Sprewell showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was for him to stay at Three Rivers until his grades caught up with his basketball , then transfer to Southwest Missouri State . The problem was , the basketball caught up and passed Southwest Missouri State , and Sprewell chose Alabama . <p> " We got Latrell sight-unseen , " Bess says . " I talked to John Hammond ( then an assistant at SW Missouri , now an assistant with the Detroit Pistons ) . He had watched Latrell on the playgrounds in Milwaukee . He told me , ' You 're going to love Latrell . He can dunk with those guys , but he does n't talk with them . ' " <p> That seemed to be a good thing in Poplar Bluff . Bess admits " some of the people around here have some red in their neck . " <p> " That 's everywhere , to me personally , " Sprewell says . " Everybody 's not going to like you . It was difficult for me to go down there . There 's not the number of black people down there that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture shock , but I was pretty comfortable there . " <p> Bess loves Sprewell as a basketball player . He echoes Nelson , saying no player he 's ever seen picks up complex basketball ideas as quickly as Sprewell . <p> " He was kind of anonymous around here initially , until well into his sophomore year when he accomplished a lot , " Bess says . " Then he was out of here real quick . Everybody liked him , though . My son was on the team and they all got along real good . Latrell was n't real quiet ; he was kind of a cut-up . <p> " People ask me what was my first impression ? I tell them I really did n't have one . " <p> And then Bess ' tone changes . He says he tries to keep in touch with Sprewell , but it 's hard . The people of Poplar Bluff would like to see their most famous alumnus return , just once . There is bitterness tumbling through his words , the bitterness of a guy who feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him back in here for a night in his honor , " Bess says . " You can imagine how big that would be for us . It would be something else for this community . But Latrell 's been really hard to pin down . I keep trying to get ahold of him , but he has n't responded . He 's big-timing us a little bit , if you know what I mean . " <p> In response , Sprewell says , " I do n't necessarily care if it 's done at all . " <p> * <p> He 's not rude . He laughs at his deliberate obfuscation , happy to keep the mystery alive . One question never leads into the next . His answers seem intended to close doors , not open them . Then it becomes clear : This is a game . Everything is covered and tucked under the pretext of Low Profile . He does n't want it . <p> " I guess we all want to be appreciated for the things we do , " Sprewell says . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " <p> A person in the Alabama sports information office says , " Nobody had a problem with him here . He really kept to himself . Nowadays that 's a pretty good story . " <p> Sprewell did n't pick up a basketball during the offseason . There 's an angle . <p> " I wanted to get some rest and enjoy the summer , " he says . <p> He played more minutes last season than any NBA player in 16 years . deserved the rest . <p> " Was that the reason you avoided the game ? " he is asked . <p> " It was n't that at all , " he says . <p> " Did the rest help you come into this season eager to play again ? " <p> " I do n't think it helped me or hurt me . " <p> He shrugs . <p> He smiles . <p> A game . <p> * <p> But he does n't always say the right things , making it even more vexing . <p> During the Warriors ' preseason trip to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mauled by one of Latrell 's four pit bulls in the backyard of his Hayward hills home . The girl lost an ear and suffered extensive injuries . <p> Some around the team were confused by Spre- well 's reaction to the incident . Again , nobody was allowed in . Any emotion remained inside the gate , behind the barricade . <p> He is asked whether the incident made this season tougher than he has let on . <p> " No , " he says . " That 's nothing I can control . " <p> " It seems it would have to affect you in some way . " <p> " No . Why should it ? " <p> " Because it was your daugther ? " <p> " No . That stuff happens . " <p> " But it does n't always happen that close to home . " <p> " People die every day . Maybe if it had been more serious it would have affected me . " <p> " Did you lose the dogs ? " <p> " No . I still got ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that ? " <p> " Did n't matter . " <p> As Bass says , " He 's very honest . Do n't ask him something if you do n't want to know the truth . " <p> * <p> We want him to unlock the secret , let those who ca n't do it at least get the pleasure of knowing what it 's like for those who can . <p> " Things on the court just come naturally , " Spre- well says . " It 's not like I have to think about anything out there , so I do n't really think about it any other time . <p> " You have to be aware of certain game situations , but when you play enough , those become reactions , too . " <p> He began playing organized basketball his senior year in high school and averaged 28 points a game . Before then , he played on the asphalt courts of Milwaukee , where he spent the last two years of high school , and Flint , where he spent the first two . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just never played on a team . I went out for the team because it was just something I wanted to do . " <p> The assumption is put forth : That must have been the best decision he ever made . <p> " No , I would n't say that , " he says quickly . <p> The obvious question hangs there : If it was n't , what was ? <p> Sprewell is smiling . The question remains unasked . <p> " Anything else ? " he asks . <p> There is n't . He walks away . The game is over . He wins . <p> There 's only one easy answer . <p> Just watch the game .
