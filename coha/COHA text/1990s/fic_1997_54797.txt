The day of Wiley 's thirtieth birthday the hurricane came , in mid-November when he and Diane thought the season was over . The day the last storms passed , he rowed out to Post Island . The big royal palm that had stood at its center was no longer there . After pulling the skiff onto the sand , he walked through the brush and saw how the wind had broken the base of the trunk , more than three feet across , the wood crumbled like sawdust . He remembered how , when he was a kid , his cousin Mack told him the palm was at least a hundred years old . It lay down through the short pines and scrub like the long , rough finger of a giant , pressed into the sand . <p> He 'd come there to bury the cat . It was a panther , a male , and Wiley 's pet , though he 'd never called it anything except " the cat . " It had died during the hurricane , but with no sign of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the crest of the hummock , next to the cabin , was above the curving line of weeds and limbs that marked the highest reach of the storm tide . The cat was just dead , that was all . There was no explaining it . <p> Sitting on the trunk of the big palm , Wiley rested from the long row and looked out over Florida Bay . It was fourteen years since the night they 'd found the cat . <p> He 'd never seen a night like it , at first clear , then a storm coming quickly over the bay , thunderheads pouring up heavy and dark across the sky . The wind blew the rain almost horizontally . He and Mack lay fiat in the skiff , and the rain went right over them . The wind blew the skiff , too , sideways like a puck on ice , but it did n't even stir the water , only spit the top of it off into foam . Then the storm was over , as quickly as it had come . The clouds moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the east . And something Wiley had never seen , a rainbow in the night , a white rainbow without colors . <p> " Look there , " Mack said , pointing in the opposite direction , across the water toward the nearest island . He had n't seen the rainbow , at least had made no sign of it . The fiat water lapped lightly against the boat , like a drifting echo of the storm . <p> Wiley recognized the land as Post Island , higher than the other islands , with the one big royal palm in the center . They were miles from the inlet that led to their camp in the Everglades . <p> " What is it ? " he said . <p> " Ca n't tell . It 's swimming toward us , though . " <p> In the moonlight Wiley could see the trail fanning out on the stilled water before he could make out the thing itself  --  a small dark head just above the surface . <p> " Gim me the light , " Mack said . <p> Wiley handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving head . Its eyes shone back a bright gold . <p> " Damn , " Mack said . <p> Wiley had been living in the camp all summer with his cousin Mack , ever since school had let out , when he 'd told his father he was through with school . His father had said nothing , only continued whipping reeds outside the shack to break them down for weaving . He stopped and twisted the stalks in his hands , the big hands that had always frightened Wiley as a child , the skin red , laced by scars . He only said , " This summer you go out and live on the island with Mack . He gon ' teach you a few things . " Then he went back to whipping the reeds against the post . <p> " Damn , " Mack said again . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " If it ai n't a cat I 'll eat it , " Mack said . <p> By the time they reached the cat it was nearly drowned . Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they saw how young it was and that it was black on its tail and along its backbone , a mass of spots that separated and then faded lower down the panther 's back , giving way to the tawny color it would be when grown . <p> " Throw it back in , " Wiley said . <p> " What for ? " Mack looked up from the cat , which lay in a wet lump , too tired even to shake the water off itself . Except for its fierce eyes , it was like a muskrat with long , bony legs . <p> " Just throw it back in . " <p> " It 's no good to kill one , " Mack said . " Better luck if you do n't kill it . " <p> " I 'll throw it in , " Wiley said . He moved toward the front of the boat . <p> " Throw it in and I 'll throw you in with it , " Mack said . He had the oar swung back as if he meant something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in . " Wiley tried to look determined . " You have n't got the nuts , " he said . <p> " Better you than the bad luck . " Mack spit into the water . He did n't act mad . He was calm . The cat was making a small noise , halfway between breathing and whimpering . Its head was down on the bottom of the skiff . <p> " Aw , hell , " Wiley said , " that thing ai n't going to live anyhow . " He nudged its side with his toe , and the cat did n't move . Its eyes were open , and they looked up at him . Even though the cat 's body was limp , they still looked fierce . <p> But the cat did n't die , at least not for years . It and Wiley 's father would die in the same year , when Wiley had gotten married and given up living alone on the isolated hummock in the shack beside the cat 's pen . He knew there was some connection between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat , but he did n't know what it was . The day after the hurricane when he went to Post Island to bury the cat , he lay down on the still-damp trunk of the fallen palm and thought how his father was in the ground and now the cat would be in the ground . All he could see , though , was what he 'd seen that morning when he looked out the window . Diane , his wife , in the yard . She shook out the wash and hung it on the line . <p> That night fourteen years earlier , the dim white rainbow had faded before Wiley remembered to show it to Mack . Good thing , he 'd thought , no telling what Mack would have wanted him to do , no telling what kind of luck would be mixed up in that . <p> " We got two more traps to check , " Mack said . " That storm done us some good . They 're right close . " <p> " Lucky for that moon , " Wiley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and he was glad to be in the boat , on the open water with the fresh smell in the air after the storm . <p> Mack rowed over , and Wiley snagged the Styrofoam blocks , white with a blue stripe , that they used to mark the crab cages . He pulled up the rope , and at the bottom was the wire-mesh trap , almost full . <p> " Look at that , " Mack said . " Luck 's better already , and we ai n't had that cat ten minutes . " <p> " Damn , Mack , " Wiley said . He looked into Mack 's close-set eyes and thought of him as a possum , eyes like a possum 's and too dumb to do anything but play dead . " These crabs were in there before we ever saw that cat . " <p> " They knew . " <p> Wiley laughed . Then Mack laughed . <p> Wiley knew Mack was too serious about luck , and it made him glad to hear him laugh . Luck was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on his own . <p> His father had sent him to learn from Mack , and what was Mack if not superstitious and old-fashioned ? He was like his father , Wiley 's Uncle George . Wiley remembered the afternoon after his mother died , when they 'd made the long trip by skiff to the highest hummock , the one where they were all buried . Wiley 's father had wanted to take the airboats , but Uncle George , who was the oldest , had refused . It was only good if you did it the old way , he had said . Wiley was ten and had only seen the graveyard once before , when his grandfather died . Almost lost in the underbrush , the cement crosses were like fat tent-poles holding up the brown palm leaves that had fallen over them . While the others looked for a place to bury his mother , Wiley watched a line of ants , thousands of them , carrying twigs and dead insects from the woods into their nest in the white sand at the foot of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the Glades ; then he remembered once in a storm he 'd seen what looked like a whole colony of ants floating on a pile of sawdust . Nearby , his uncle was probing the sand and peat with a long metal rod , looking for pits in the rock beneath , where the limestone marl had dissolved and left a hole deep enough to bury someone . His uncle found the place , and the others began to dig . Wiley watched them turn up the loam . They were lucky that the water had eaten the rock away . There was no way you could dig into the rock , not even with a pickax . <p> The cat was lying still , maybe dead , in the bottom of the boat as Mack rowed to the last trap . When they emptied it they saw that the last three had given them more crabs than the rest put together . Wiley shook the blue crabs into the gunnysack and then baited the trap again with mullet scraps . <p> " Beer money , " Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back into the oars , and the skiff shot toward the inlet . It would take them a good thirty minutes to get back to the camp , so Wiley leaned against the bow and rested his head , looking up at the stars . Mack breathed evenly but deeply as he rowed . The oars hit the water with a smack . For a while Wiley had thought Mack was crazy for not wanting an outboard . They were so much faster , he 'd argued . He remembered how Mack finished his beer without saying a word . Then he tossed the can clattering off the edge of the porch and said , " It ai n't the money . That ai n't it . It 's just that when you go fast you start thinking fast . " <p> Diane was always thinking fast . From the day when , as kids , they first started talking about getting married , she was thinking of things for him to do . She 'd been born in a shack just like him , and when they were little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for them to quit high school together and go to Miami . While he spent the summer with Mack , she went to Miami and took a job in a department store selling perfume and scarves . She wrote him every other day and put a different perfume on each letter . She said it was so he would n't forget her . After a while the perfumes smelled alike to him . None of them smelled like her . He wrote to her and told her , and she did n't respond for a while . The summer was almost over . His time at the camp with Mack was ending , and he was supposed to go to Miami to find a job and be with Diane . But she quit writing , and then he did n't know what to do . The cat was healthy by then , and it had put on weight so that its ribs did n't show . Its coat was sleek , and Wiley would take the cat out of its pen and sit on the ground under the big pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth in the pink gums reminded him of Diane . He did n't know why . He 'd stopped trying to think things out . <p> " When 's Diane coming back ? " Mack said . The oars did n't miss a beat . He was not winded , but he spoke between breaths , like " When 's Diane ... coming back ? " as if the two parts of the question were two different questions . <p> " I do n't know . I think she 's mad at me for what I wrote her . " <p> " What 's that ? " " Nothing . " <p> " Nothing ? " <p> " Nothing I can explain . " <p> " She 'll come back , " Mack said . Then a breath , a stroke of the oar . " If you want her to . " <p> She had n't come back , and he had n't gone to Miami . It was September when he heard from her again . In the letter she mentioned that someone named Roy was giving her rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The boat was approaching the island where the camp was , and Wiley lifted his head , looking first at the cat , which lay very still beside the middle seat , and then at Mack , who did n't seem to have tired at all . The boat was gliding through the water at the same even pace , oars smacking the surface as if pulled down and pushed up not by Mack 's arms but by the water itself . <p> " What are you going to do with that cat ? " Wiley asked . <p> " Not me , " Mack said . " You . " <p> " Me ? " <p> " It 's your luck . I already have my luck . " <p> Wiley looked into Mack 's possum eyes and saw nothing , no sign that he was joking . <p> " I do n't want any luck from that cat . " <p> " You do n't have to want it . It 's yours . " <p> The cat would live fourteen years , its fur changing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light as though oiled . Opening the door of the big pen he 'd built at the edge of the clearing , Wiley would go in to change the water in the trough , though the cat rarely drank . And he would go in with the small animals he 'd trapped . He liked to rub the fur under the cat 's neck and along its sides and back , behind its ears , and in the depression between the heavy U-shaped bone of its lower jaw . <p> Luck . His father sent him to the camp for the summer to be with Mack and to learn from him , and all he 'd learned was that luck was what a guy had when the traps were full of crabs and it was what he had when his girl went to Miami and stopped writing him . To Mack it was all luck . Trust it , and then you could call it good luck . Do n't trust it , and it would always be bad , even when things turned out right . Luck confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see it there , luck , so simple and ignorant , like a possum playing dead . <p> They were almost to the pier , and Wiley saw the cabin through the pines . Under the full moon , the square white pine box with a slanted tin roof shone between the shadows of the trees . It looked to him as if he could walk up to it and lean down and lift off the roof , letting the light in so he could see what had been left inside . <p> " You can start building the pen for the cat tomorrow , " Mack said . <p> Wiley hoped the cat would n't live , and he was n't about to start working on a pen for it . It had begun to shiver , and the shivering made it look even more sickly . The bones of its shoulders poked up as if only the skin was holding them in place . <p> " You can build one big enough so when it grows up it can have some room . " <p> They were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piling and grabbed it , pulling the skiff in and sliding it to the second piling , where he tied the bow rope , wrapped it three times , and then used the knot his father had shown him . He jumped up on the pier and looked down at Mack , who had put the oars in place inside the boat and was leaning over the middle seat to get the sack of crabs . <p> " I ai n't building no pen , " Wiley said . <p> " I 'll get the crabs , you get the cat , " Mack said . <p> " I ai n't building no pen . " <p> Mack threw the bag onto the pier . The crabs inside scuffled and clamored , their shells clacking against each other . <p> Then Mack was standing close in front of him , and Wiley felt a strange fear in his chest . It was n't a fear like the one he had from the storm coming fast over the bay ; it was more like the feeling when he sent his last letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never seen , and trying to imagine her there . <p> Years later , the day she returned to his father 's house , he 'd almost forgotten Diane . It was early in the summer before he turned twenty-nine . His father had had the first stroke a few weeks before , and the old man was in the living room , lying on his side , staring through the screen door the way he had since they 'd brought him back from the hospital . Wiley and his cousin Bill had tried to get the old man into the bedroom , but he began to whimper and his right eye got wild , so they took him to the couch , and he rested there easily . Day and night he lay there , slightly curled , staring , even when it was so dark you could n't see past the doorway . <p> " Yoo hoo , " she said , stepping toward the screen , and Wiley knew it was Diane before he heard her voice , almost as soon as her feet touched the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later that maybe he had smelled her , that faint old familiar smell , because she was not wearing any of the perfume of her letters . <p> He rushed from the kitchen , where he 'd been washing the dishes from dinner . " Diane , " he said , smiling at her through the screen door . <p> He knew from her smile that everything was back to the way it had been . <p> " It 's been a long time , " he said . He unlatched the door and let her in . She crossed to where his father was on the couch , bent over and brushed the hair from his face . <p> " I heard , " she said . <p> " It happened last month , " Wiley said . <p> Diane stood up straight and turned from his father . She put her arms around Wiley and kissed him , running her hands behind his neck and pulling his lips tight against hers . <p> When she loosened her hold and pulled away , she walked quickly to the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " she said . Her voice seemed fierce and out of breath , like the voice of someone standing over you after a long fight . " And I feel the same way about you I always have . I never did quit on you . " She crossed the porch and jumped over the steps onto the ground . Wiley watched as she walked down the road and out of sight where it turned through the pine thicket . <p> It was never in the daytime but only at night that Wiley heard the cat pacing . Then he would go out beside its cage and lie on his back on the pine needles , looking up through the trees and listening . To his own breathing and the breathing of the cat as it paced the length of its pen . A patient insistence in the air . Not like the wind , coming from somewhere else , but rising from the air itself in its stillness . He would lie on his back listening , and he would fall asleep , taking the sound into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning with the feeling , as he awoke into the light , that he was suffocating . <p> On the pier , Mack standing in front of him , the bag of crabs rattling at his feet , Wiley was able to think of nothing but the air , the warm night air , and the decaying smell of the vegetation washed up along the shoreline . He could n't focus on Mack 's face ; it was a blank space . Then he and Mack were struggling , rolling on the pier . He had no idea which of them had started it . They 'd come together without realizing what they were doing . Rolling across the planks like men whose clothes were on fire , each tried to get a solid hit into the other 's ribs . The blows glanced off . Their hands bled from hitting the boards of the pier instead of each other . <p> Then they were in the water , the shallows near the shore , and the mud was all over them and they were sucking it in with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other with one arm and striking wildly with the other . They realized this was no fight . They were not fighting each other . This was crazy , nothing but blind , crazy action . They were laughing . They stood up , and the mud dripped off them . <p> " You and your good luck , " Wiley said laughing , his sides hurting , not from the blows but because he was out of breath and could n't stop laughing . <p> " You and your cat , " Mack said . " Love at first sight if I ever seen it . " <p> They climbed onto the pier and lay on their backs , catching their breaths . Swarms of mosquitoes buzzed around their heads , but the mud stopped them . Wiley touched the drying mud over his face and felt as if he 'd sunk into the earth , like he was wearing it around him and nothing could touch him . <p> Mack laughed again . Wiley looked over and saw the figure of mud , his twin , its two eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out to the highway and put up a sign , " Mack said . " Swamp creatures ... five dollars a look . " <p> Wiley rolled his head back and gazed at the sky . The moon was above them , even a little to the west , starting to go down . There were a few clouds around it , dark ones , and it lit up their edges so he could get a sense of the tops of them , where the light hit them straight on . He had n't thought about the way a person could see things like that , how it looked from up where the moon was . <p> That afternoon years later when Diane had come back from Miami , he watched her walking away down the road and turned back into the room and saw his father lying on his side on the couch . He knew then that he had stopped seeing his father . He saw only an old man on the couch , a carving that did n't change . Like the picture of Diane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even before she had left . He 'd never really seen her , only an image of her . He sat down on the floor in front of his father and ran his fingers through the old man 's hair , still dark and thick despite his age . <p> Diane returned the next day and brought a cake , chocolate with white coconut icing . It was his father 's favorite , and she sat on the floor and pushed spoon after spoon of it into his mouth until he began to move toward the spoon when she raised it . His lips could not hold the food well , and crumbs were on the couch and on the floor , but Wiley was amazed at the life struggling back into his father . <p> Wiley sat across the room in the old cane rocker and watched Diane , seeing her for the first time . Her long , straight dark hair moved sideways as she leaned in to feed his father , like the tall reeds in a breeze , he thought . <p> Later that night , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp , rowing down the dark channels through the tall sawgrass . He felt as if he were rowing through her hair . Through her hair and into the last channel to the camp , the little shack , and the pen where the cat was . He lit the lantern and hung it on the end post of the porch , went out to the edge of the light , to the pen , and gave the cat the two possums he had trapped . The cat did n't pay attention to the possums . Usually it did n't seem to notice the food he brought , not until it thought it was alone . Then there would be a brief scuffle , and he would hear it in the dark , crunching the bones . <p> Time passed so quickly . His father recovered , and then he was gone . Diane did n't go with Wiley and the others to bury him . It was too close to time for her to have the baby , and her mother was with her in the house , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly to his father . He was sitting at the table , finishing his dinner and talking about getting a TV so he could watch the news . He said it took too long to get the news by the papers and a TV was necessary . He knew from the neighbors that they could pick up at least one station from Miami , sometimes two . And a small black-and-white would n't cost much . " There 's a lot to see these days , " he said . He was sipping the dregs of his coffee . His lips were in control , so he did n't have to worry about hot things anymore . Diane had nursed him back . Coffee was one of the things he loved most . He put down the empty cup . " There 's a lot we 're missing , " he said . Then a strange look came into his eyes . Before Wiley could reach him from the other side of the table , he slid onto the floor . The big hands lay open , with the fingers curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing his eyes were staring toward . <p> The next week the November hurricane blew down the big palm , but it did n't harm either the camp or the pen where the cat was . A few pines were down in the woods , their trunks twisted by the whirling winds . The cat lay still when Wiley went to feed it after the storm , and when he entered the cage he saw the cat was dead . He lifted its head in his hand . He could n't tell what he was feeling . At first it seemed like a sickness inside him , down in his stomach , but then all his muscles relaxed . He lay beside the cat 's body and fell asleep . <p> Late in the afternoon he woke up . He carried the cat to the skiff , stowed the shovel under the seat , then pushed off . The channel was full of trash from the storm , limbs and reeds and clumps of sea grass stirred up from the bottom by the waves . It was a long pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bury the cat at the foot of the palm . When he got to the island and saw that the hurricane had blown it down , he dug the hole anyway where he 'd intended , three feet long and two feet wide , down about four feet until he thought he was going to hit rock . But there was no rock . It struck him then why the tree grew so old there : a large , deep depression in the marl . The sun was going down , and he watched it out over the bay , thinking where he and Mack had been that night after the storm blew them across the water . He put the cat in the hole and said good-bye to it and filled the hole with sand . When he 'd finished he sat on the crumbling stump of the palm and watched the sun turning flat as it went down into the water . <p> The week before when they buried his father , nothing had seemed finished the way he thought it should . He felt his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't repay . Now the cat was dead . But this time it was finished , all of it . He lay on the fallen trunk and looked at the water . He thought of his father lying those months on the couch , afraid to recover , but afraid he would not recover too , and the cat in its pen , waiting patiently until it was alone . As if time did n't exist until it was alone . <p> He and Mack lying together , side by side , on the pier , both of them covered with mud like swamp creatures , and then time starting up and Mack saying , " Hell , Wiley , that was the strangest fight I ever been in . " <p> Then Wiley getting up and standing over Mack , looking into . those eyes that stared up at him out of the mud , saying , " Me too , " and wanting to say something else but not being able to . It was something like thank you , but it did n't make any sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cat . It hissed at him and arched its back , still lying there exhausted , but arching its back as if it would fight him to the death . <p> " Come on , " he said to the cat . He folded one of the empty gunny-sacks for the crabs and used it like a mitt to lift the cat carefully , holding it along its back so it could n't bite or claw him . " You got a new life now , " he said . <p> <p> By JOHN BENSKO <p>
