George Gershwin was at the keyboard one more time last week , banging out richly embellished versions of his pop tunes Swanee and Kickin ' the Clouds Away . Though Gershwin has been dead for more than a half-century , his distinctive performing style has been preserved on nearly 120 player-piano rolls that he cut between 1916 and 1926 . These virtuoso piano solos were never transcribed into sheet music , however . Since the demise of the player piano , the fragile paper rolls that hold the solos have been deteriorating on private collectors ' shelves , unheard by generations of Gershwin scholars and fans . <P> Until now . Thanks to advances in technology , Gershwin 's piano rolls have been rescued from oblivion . Under the supervision of Gershwin scholar Artis Wodehouse , an optical scanner was used to convert the holes that activate the keys into computer files that can be understood by today 's music synthesizers . Last week 's performance on ABC 's Good Morning America was played by a Yamaha Disklavier , a $20,000 grand piano that comes with a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by computer , is scheduled to be released later this year . <P> Gershwin is not the only performer whose works could be computerized . Rachmaninoff , Ravel and Debussy also recorded piano rolls . But it was such keyboard acrobats as Gershwin and Zez Confrey , playing in the florid " novelty " style developed to boost player-piano sales , who were the stars of their day . Says Wodehouse : " This will open up an era of music that has been largely forgotten . "
