THE LOGIC OF AN ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE IN A POST-NATO EUROPE <p> If , as Gibbon assures us , history is little more than a register of the crimes , follies , and misfortunes of mankind , then we may today be witnessing a train of events that our posterity will regard as among the sorriest and most tragic of history 's chapters . After having been instrumental in Europe 's enjoyment of a lengthy era of peace , a " long peace " without precedent ; 1 after having achieved the integration ( in the security sphere , as the European Community , now the European Union EU , was able to accomplish in the economic sphere ) of disparate and quarrelsome nation-states with a history of bloody conflict ; and most singularly , after having served as the necessary vehicle for ensuring the vital post-World War II participation of the United States in the defense of Western Europe against the geopolitical challenge posed by the Soviet Union during the four decades of the Cold War , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been continually building in the wake of the alliance 's unparalleled success . <p> With the swift demise and ongoing dissolution of the USSR and even of the Russian state , which is its most similarly disposed successor , NATO has been deprived of the threat and of the binding glue that threat must now be recognized as having constituted . Economic competition , budgetary and fiscal woes , and differing perceptions of national interests and security needs may now increasingly undermine the alliance 's cohesiveness . Freed of their fear of the defeated former aspirant to continental hegemony , the European members of NATO no longer feel compelled to accede quite as readily to American wishes or to American direction as they might have previously . In this country , voices in the Congress , in the media , and in academia question the rationale for continued U.S. participation in an entangling foreign alliance in light of these distressing realities . Other , seemingly more pressing concerns  --  sometimes as near to home as the boat people of Haiti ; other times far away on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apparent development of nuclear weapons  --  seem at times to be far more compelling issues than Europe . The West 's own victory in the Cold War and the consequent end of bipolarity have made possible the circumstances under which NATO and Western geostrategic unity may unravel and come completely undone . <p> What can and should the United States do in the event these accelerating tendencies continue , leading to increasing irrelevancy and finally to termination of the North Atlantic alliance ? What constitutes the hard kernel , the irreducible minimum in terms of this nation 's requirements for formal alliance with others in the international community ? <p> A glance at history and an appreciation of enduring security and strategic realities should illustrate that an Anglo-American alliance has been and would remain the most basic foundation for the protection of both nations ' most fundamental interests in the disorder of a post-Cold War world where the greater protection afforded by the broader North Atlantic alliance will have been renounced . A revivified " special relationship " has the capacity to account for and to serve American vital interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The argument made herein is not premised on a sentimental regard for the " unity of the English-speaking peoples , " nor does it rely upon shibboleths such as the centuries of shared common law or anachronisms like the now vanished inter-relatedness of the two nations ' elites . If there ever was any real foundation for these particular arguments , then the passing of the British Empire ( as well as the continued loosening of even Commonwealth ties with the old , white , and English-speaking dominions ) , along with the rapidly changing ethnic patterns in the United States has deprived them of relevance. 2 Time 's inexorable march has also circumscribed the geographic scope of any renewed Anglo-American alliance , since Asian-Pacific possessions , once the subjects of shared concern and strategic planning , such as Singapore , Hong Kong , or the Philippines , either are now or soon will be outside the scope of any mutual security concerns . History has at last reduced Britain to the status of a regional power , concerned exclusively with strategic and political realities just across the English Channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War has freed the United States from the burden of worldwide security and alliance commitments , allowing for a tight focus upon areas truly vital . Chief among these areas must always be Europe . <p> A revivified Anglo-American alliance would be of necessity concentrated on common vital interests in Europe , and in Western Europe in particular . Such an alliance would serve as the best available means for reaffirming that Britain and the United States share today , as they have shared for the better part of two centuries , an enduring common interest in maintaining a tolerable balance of power on the European continent . UNHINGING THE ALLIANCE : TRENDS TOWARD DISUNITY <p> Events in and around Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia have been a debacle for NATO and those , such as its late Secretary-General Manfred Worner , who have been proponents of maintenance of the alliance for use in peace-making , peacekeeping and other post-Cold War operations that might serve to prove its continued relevance and usefulness . It has simply not been possible to achieve the necessary consensus , the unity of purpose , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balkans that existed and that was essential to alliance cohesion during its heyday in the Cold War . Regardless of how appalling the nightly news reports might be and how distressing the images of communal slaughter , it is clear that no strategic or great power security issues are at stake in Bosnia . That being the case , there is virtually no likelihood of organized intervention sanctioned by NATO . Token air strikes , undertaken only grudgingly and more as a substitute for the dreaded ground action to which virtually no member of the alliance is prepared to accede , will not impress , deter , nor defeat the Serb forces fighting in Bosnia . <p> The Serbian-sponsored aggression will continue , and it will continue to underscore NATO 's inertia for critics of the alliance . Vocal proponents of " morality " as a basis for American foreign policy will grow disenchanted with the alliance as a relic of the Cold War , unsuited for the new circumstances requiring assertion of American strength , and resort to force in order to affirm their version of right and justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dangerous place , if anything even more dangerous in its bewildering complexity , will be disappointed by the failure of NATO 's European members to follow the hegemonic leadership of the United States into a demonstration of the alliance 's continued viability and utility in just such a situation of danger and complexity . <p> The conspicuous failure to agree on concerted action in the former Yugoslavia , a region geographically close to some members of NATO and yet far from others , is illustrative of the problem that threatens to pull the alliance apart . In the absence of the common threat that encouraged the continental nation-states to pool their forces and integrate their command structures , to focus their energies , differing national interests dictated by geographic proximity to the problem have emerged to prevent concerted action by the NATO states . The interest of newly united Germany in the Balkans must differ appreciably from that of more distant France , which in rum must be of a completely different order from the concern of the British . An ocean away , it is almost impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country , and people are understandably reluctant to see their country involved where no such interests are concerned . <p> In Western Europe , recent events would seem to dramatically underscore the continued vitality of the nation-state and its claim to sovereignty as a severe constraint on the federalizing notions that animate the European Union in the aftermath of the members ' ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union . Referenda on ratification of Maastricht in France and in Denmark were just barely successful , with passage in Britain 's Parliament turning into a " damned close run thing " in light of the weakness of the Major government even among its own backbenchers . The German parliament announced that it was retaining the right to decide if and when the deutschemark would be abandoned in favor of a common currency , while the actual prospect of economic union ( and the political union for which it is intended to be the curtain-raiser ) has been badly derailed by last year 's collapse of the Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) and the European Monetary System ( EMS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's growth and disrupted the perception of the inevitability of its widening to include all of Western Europe . Going it alone may well become more attractive , even as the two-tier approach countenanced by Maastricht allows reluctant EU member states to opt out of certain features of the Treaty on European Union . <p> In the field of its economic relations no less than in its security relations , European cohesion received its basic impetus from the fear of the threat posed by the Soviet Union . Deprived of that threat , relieved of that fear , the economic and political ambitions of the European Union have become far less likely to be achieved . The claims of each individual nation-state to economic sovereignty and to political independence , based on national interests , must become less constrained as fear of the outside threat wanes . Unwillingness to accept U.S. leadership or initiatives in Bosnia and criticism of the American military/humanitarian intervention in Somalia are indicative of the growing difficulties with holding together an alliance that , as Gorbachev threatened , has been deprived of its enemy and hence its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German unification , and its magnified significance in light of the chaotic Russian weakness that will continue as a political fact of life for the foreseeable future , constitutes the single greatest factor militating in favor of NATO 's disintegration . No longer constrained , nor even balanced , by a powerful Russian state , and with numerous smaller states in close proximity separating it from Russia to the east , the unified German state will be free as it has not been since 1945 to revert to its predecessors ' traditional policy of seeking a sphere of influence to the south and east . In what is even now in the process of becoming a " deutschemarke zone " in areas of former Soviet control , the powerful new German state will more and more seek to assert its own national interests separate and apart from those of its NATO allies . From Britain and the United States especially will German national interests diverge , being offshore powers far removed from the venues of traditional German attention . Deprived of the looming threat from the east , the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard NATO forces stationed in Germany as occupying forces , which , of course , they in part are ! 3 The unique integration of German forces into NATO 's structure will come to seem anomalous , or as an anti-German artifact meant to keep such a potentially powerful entity permanently defanged . <p> German reorientation to a traditional , pre-1945 foreign and security policy will follow logically from the fact of the existence of a fully sovereign state situated in its geographically central position in Europe . The traditional German policy of Schaukelpolitik , of shifting back and forth between East and West while maintaining independence and becoming an actual part of neither , and of seeking economic and political predominance in a Mitteleuropa , was submerged by Germany 's defeat and division and by the bipolar competition between the superpowers during the Cold War . However , the inescapable result of the Cold War 's end , with the complete rout of the Russian superpower and the appearance of new successor states , is to create again the circumstances under which older but still vital tendencies may re-emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , or even a potential barrier , it will become an unwelcome straitjacket that a fully sovereign German nation-state will seek to cast off . <p> This can come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Lord Ismay 's rightly celebrated aphorism describing the North Atlantic Alliance as a trinity serving three related purposes : ( 1 ) keeping the Russians out , ( 2 ) keeping the Americans in , and ( 3 ) keeping the Germans down . The first of these three purposes is gone , the result of Cold War victory , and like a three-legged stool that has had one of its supports sawed off by a prankster , the remaining edifice can not be supported any longer by the two remaining legs . The unbalanced structure that NATO has become will fall over immediately . A fully sovereign German nation-state , one that is no longer constrained or inhibited by fear of its powerful Russian neighbor , would reject an alliance that is widely acknowledged as aiming primarily at Germany 's continued pacification . <p> Wise policy seeks to anticipate such events rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncushioned fall , wise U.S. policy should now at least begin to anticipate that NATO , the institution through which American vital interests in Europe have been asserted for more then forty years , may soon become moribund . A different arrangement may soon have to be structured that will be more reflective of post-Cold War realities , both foreign and domestic . Neo-isolationism , as traditional and time-honored an American policy as is Schaukelpolitik a German one , will compete with moral and humanitarian interventionism and with continued Cold War orthodoxy for the allegiance of an American public preoccupied with health care and fiscal issues at home . None of these can serve the full spectrum of American requirements as well as can the Anglo-American alliance here advocated . Fundamental , even minimal security needs , combined with essential defense cuts and savings for necessary investments in the crying needs of the American domestic economy , can be realized on the basis of this familiar but still vital relationship . HISTORICAL SOURCES OF COOPERATION <p> Within ten years of the British capture and destruction of the American capital in 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless de facto alliance that ensured the security of both until the rise of the Second German Reich and the attempt by that state to establish its continental hegemony during the First World War . Announcement of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 proceeded without a formal tie with Britain , despite the progress of negotiations in London between Canning , the British foreign secretary , and Rush , the American minister , only because it was clear that the upstart and still weak republic was indeed backed by the strength and determination of Britain . The effect of the de facto alliance was to prevent united action by the Great Powers of Europe in the New World , the unchallenged Royal Navy effectively excluding this until the ill-fated French adventure in Mexico during the time that the United States was distracted by its Civil War in the early 1860s . The British were spared the necessity of fortifying the U.S.-Canadian border and were thereby freed to concentrate on their great nineteenth century romance of maritime empire . Even so , there could exist such security only as long as no dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power that was au fond the source of both British and American security . The common geostrategic interest of the two nations in maintaining a balance of power on the European continent was precisely the same . Both Great Britain and the United States owed their positions as late nineteenth century Great Powers to the fact that Europe was not organized under the aegis of any single power or authority able to dominate the continent and its enormous resources . Such a dominant power would have been then , just as it would have been in post-1945 Europe and just as it would be today in post-Cold War Europe , a threat to the vital interests of both the United States and Britain . <p> Such a potentially dominant power did ultimately emerge in Germany , which with the passage of its Naval Law of 1898 and its successive extensions signaled that its ruling economic and political elites harbored pretensions to continental hegemony and beyond , even to contesting maritime predominance with insular Britain . Notwithstanding Wilsonian rhetoric about first being " too proud to fight , " and then about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States finally went to war against Imperial Germany in 1917 because , after three years of warfare against a coalition lead by the British , that single European nation-state seemed to have within its grasp a hegemony over western and central Europe that directly threatened the vital interests of the United States of America . Britain , of course , had been waging war against Germany since 1914 , having previously resolved to maintain its margin of clear naval superiority and to adhere to its traditional policy of seeking to balance the strongest continental state in order to prevent the organization of the continent 's resources against her . <p> British policy sought to prevent any power from growing so large and so dominant as to become capable of establishing its hegemony throughout Europe . Britain quite simply could no longer execute this policy by itself , unaided by its de facto ally across the Atlantic , which benefited equally from the policy 's previous success . Germany was prevented from achieving its war aims only by the timely intervention of American power . <p> Political and diplomatic failure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Second World War in Europe , really act two of a five-decade-long drama in which the German nation-state grew so powerful and so populous in relation to every other European nation-state as to overthrow the four hundred-year-old state system and its balance of power mechanism that had allowed insular Britain to remain independent and the United States to develop peacefully into a continental-size superstate itself . As in the first act , alliance between the United States and Britain , although it came late , came in time to prevent ( or more correctly , in time to undo ) the German reach for hegemony in Europe and for dominance over the continent 's resources and skilled populations . THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP <p> Reference to a " special relationship " between the United States and Great Britain was actually made initially by Winston Churchill in the course of a speech in the House of Commons in late 1945 , and then again , more memorably , in his famous " Iron Curtain " speech of 5 March 1946 at Fulton , Missouri . Recalling the success of the wartime Anglo-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States that any return to isolation would be a disaster revisited , and that perpetuation of a " special relationship " between the " English-speaking peoples " was the most certain way to assure postwar peace in Europe and throughout the world . It is understandable that Churchill , as well as others , should have been impressed with the success and the durability of the Anglo-American alliance that fought the Second World War , and that its unique closeness should have been deemed especially remarkable . It was a marked contrast to the relationship that had existed throughout the previous war . During the American participation in the Great War , the United States had referred to itself as " associated " with the Western Allies , thereby emphatically underscoring the continued element of American separateness from the European powers . There was no mistaking the nature of Anglo-American relations from 1941-45 . <p> Yet it would be a mistake to ascribe descriptions of the closeness of Anglo-American relations during this period either to Churchillian romanticism or to the isolated quality of the personal relationship between the American president and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake to dismiss the real and extensive nature of the strategic agreement between the two countries by overemphasizing areas of wartime dispute , such as the controversy over when , or even whether , to invade Western Europe and open a second front against Germany . Such disputes often revealed little more than a conflict over the means to an agreed upon end , rather than the end itself , which is certainly the case with regard to re-entry into continental Europe during 1943-44 . The fact remains that the two states shared a common need , a common vital interest , in opposing the German attempt to dominate Europe after the fall of France in 1940 , and that they pursued that common vital interest in a way that distinguished their alliance from , earlier such combinations of effort . No doubt encouraged by the basic fact of a shared common language that , then as now , allowed easy communication at all levels , personal as well as institutional , the alliance born of common imperiled vital interests developed a special nature . Examples abound , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing of intelligence , to the creation of liaisons between the individual services ( i.e. , army to army , navy to navy , etc. ) , to the joint project that culminated in the advent of nuclear weapons . <p> Most importantly , the immediate agreement on a strategy rather than Japan , illustrates the profound geopolitical and strategic unity upon which the alliance was premised . Mortal peril threatened both Britain and America in the form of a German-dominated Western and Central Europe , and no other conflict , regardless of how " infamous " its ignition point , could possibly concentrate the attentions of policymakers or war planners or strategists in the same way . Having to defend its increasingly moribund empire in India and East Asia served only to weaken the British war effort in the only arena where her vital interests were truly at stake , which was the traditional locale where her armies and her diplomats had concentrated their attentions for hundreds of years . American national security was never seriously threatened in the Pacific , even at the height of the Japanese tide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active U.S. belligerency . POST-1945 : DEFENDING THE WEST <p> Foreseeably , the nature of Anglo-American relations altered after the defeat of Germany . Power , by every measure and description , whether military or economic , was increasingly an American possession , while it slipped faster and faster from the weakening grasp of Britain . The American determination to create and foster an open , multilateral trading regime throughout the world often was seen to clash with older British-dominated trading patterns . A United States that seemed to have reached an unprecedented apogee of power , wealth , and influence was in marked contrast to the diminished circumstances of its wartime ally . <p> This marked , and increasingly progressive , disparity in the postwar power of the two nations , along with the defeat of the common enemy that had drawn them together so closely , certainly provided the background to the downgrading of the special relationship that characterized the era of the Cold War . A dominant United States became a superpower , unique in its dominance and imbued with worldwide interests and responsibilities . Simultaneously , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empire and relative economic decline meant that Britain became more and more an appendage of American policy and less and less an independent element in world politics . The end of Britain 's centuries-long status as a great power , made patent by Suez in 1956 and by continuous budgetary contractions thereafter , illustrated that the relationship could not remain as it had been . Power , being not only a relative but also a dynamic concept , was the element dividing the two allies and altering the unique , historical circumstances that had allowed for such a special relationship to exist in the first place . <p> Yet common ground there was , and upon the continuing recognition of common vital interests was constructed the core of the postwar Atlantic alliance . Again , although issues of common language and culture were often afforded lip service ( and as stated , certainly made cooperation easier ) , and although the sentiments engendered by shared wartime camaraderie among men who succeeded to postwar leadership may have been substantial , the bedrock of the Anglo-American relationship remained as it had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the balance of power in nineteenth century Europe , the Anglo-American relationship post- 1945 continued to be based on that same common recognition of the continuing necessity for maintaining such a balance in the wake of the war 's conclusion . The peace that followed the end of the Second World War , the geopolitical structure of that peace , was itself a legacy of how Britain and America had fought the conflict in Europe , and with what allies the war had been fought . Defending the balance of power in Europe against what both nations correctly understood to be Russian pretensions to continental hegemony became the defining characteristic of the Anglo-American relationship in Europe in the years after the Second World War . This culminated in formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) in 1949 and the formal reintroduction of American forces back to the continent , a feat accomplished thanks in great part to the labors of British policy and a British foreign secretary. 4 <p> The post-1945 focus and durability of the special relationship is , if anything , revealed more strongly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its continuation , or that might even have wrecked a traditional alliance founded upon other , less-enduring foundations than those discussed herein . For example , despite Churchill 's usual historical association both with the term " special relationship " and with the need for continued close cooperation as well as U.S. participation in a postwar military alliance , it was in fact the enthusiastic support and encouragement of a Labour government that made possible the reintroduction of American power into Europe via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1948-49 ; throughout the lengthy and often painful process of Britain 's devolution of empire and the long retreat from great power status , even through the debacle of Suez and the controversy over Skybolt , Anglo-American relations remained firmly grounded in a mutual recognition that the heart of the two nations ' common concerns remained unchanged by any listing of distractions ; America 's traditional ( and after 1945 , re-emphasized ) antipathy toward British colonialism and imperial patterns of trade remained a constant source of friction in the years immediately after World War II . <p> Even the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in 1967 to withdraw from defense commitments " east of Suez " did not alter the fundamental agreement on defense of Europe . Despite these omnipresent sources of contentiousness , the balance of power in Europe , the never ceasing contest for control or denial of control over the industrial and human resources of the most fecund continent on Earth had to remain , even as it must today , the most basic common ground for these two inseparable allies . AFTER NATO : THE RETURN OF HISTORY <p> In the increasingly likely , albeit tragic , event that NATO becomes a victim of its own spectacular success and succumbs to the strains and conflicts of both irrelevance and reassertive German national consciousness , then Americans and Britons will have to re-examine the available methods for insuring their most basic vital interests . NATO has performed this task for more than forty years , by entangling Britain and ( more especially ) the United States in the security and political affairs of Western Europe , with the felicitous effect of defusing the competing security concerns of the alliance 's members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-American presence within NATO allows , indeed compels , the alliance to turn the sharp end of its spear exclusively toward the east and toward the enemy that threatens all equally . The question posed here is how shall Britain and the United States go about attempting to provide for the basic security needs that NATO will no longer satisfy ? <p> Again , it is the Anglo-American presence within , actually inside , Western Europe , with ground troops serving under an integrated command structure , that has been the essence of NATO and that will be lost if and when the alliance is allowed to expire . As Professor J. D. Crouch II states in a recent article , there is indeed a significant distinction between Britain and the United States having mere " access " to the European continent as opposed to having an actual and continuing " presence " on that strategically vital land mass. 5 NATO 's demise and the consequent severance of the American connection to France must spell the end of any such " presence " within Western Europe , leaving the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative . Such access to Western Europe and the ability to effect a re-entry to the continent , by force if necessary , was the basis of the Anglo-American special relationship as it developed during the Second World War , and it augurs to remain so in a post-NATO Europe of the early twenty-first century . <p> A post-NATO Anglo-American alliance , a distinctly second-best security choice , therefore provides for the most basic needs of the type of peripheral strategy that such an alliance would of necessity pursue . Faced with the loss of the NATO troop and weaponry presence already on the ground in the traditional cockpit of Western Europe , an Anglo-American alliance would at least allow for the offshore positioning of those elements that would be utilized to reassert the two nations ' enduring vital interests , should such a reassertion ever become necessary . This , of course , is the familiar theory of Britain as the great " unsinkable aircraft carrier " : just offshore and therefore able to function precisely as it did in 1944 as the base for re-entry by force into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-American alliance also assures the two nations of other , vital strategic prerequisites to a forcible re-entry into Western Europe : assurance of the ability to gain and hold air superiority at the time and place of the re-entry effort , and control over the sea lanes and routes of supply upon which the logistics of any such effort must necessarily be premised. 7 Air power and shipping were , and should remain , the centerpieces of Anglo-American power even as the end of the twentieth century approaches , and with good reason . If we can not guarantee that our strategic vital interests will be served by the best expedient , which is men and women on the ground in an integrated NATO system , then the United States and the United Kingdom will have to exploit their more traditional expedients of seapower and the technological superiority of their combined airpower . <p> So military and naval cooperation will need to be emphasized in a post-NATO Anglo-American alliance , perhaps in a fashion similar to 1941-45 when the institution of the Combined Chiefs of Staff effectively unified the British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation even remotely akin to the life and death peril that motivated the alliance of the Second World War and the Combined Chiefs , but the latter institution should nonetheless serve as a guide to the manner in which effective alliance military and naval planning can and perhaps should be ordered . The integrated command structure of NATO is the institution that is to be replaced , and the Combined Chiefs of Staff approach would certainly perform such a role . <p> Continued diplomatic and intelligence cooperation must be emphasized in the Anglo-American alliance of a post-NATO world . Perhaps best exemplified by the events leading up to and including the actual fighting in the Gulf War in 1990-91 , there have been a number of recent examples illustrating the relative ease with which cooperation can result when it is the result of a history both of such cooperation and of common interests . American support for the British position in the Falklands War was reciprocated by British support for the bombing raid on Libya in 1986 , and as stated , the two nations actually followed an integrated diplomatic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crisis there in August 1990. 8 CONCLUSION <p> Common diplomatic positions are essential to support common geopolitical and strategic concerns , the vital interests over which conflict results . History and geography both illustrate that Britain and the United States share their most basic , irreducibly vital interests in Europe , and therefore confirm that these two states must remain each other 's closest ally in the world that , tragically , is probably coming . With the slow but probably inevitable dissolution of NATO , informed opinion in both the United States and the United Kingdom will come to recognize the enduring facts that gave rise to common purpose in the nineteenth century and that gave birth to formal alliance in the face of the great crises of the twentieth century . In the twenty-first century , the same enduring facts will , one hopes , give rise again to the same clear and accurate recognition of common interests unlike those that any other two nations possess , and this familiar , repeated recognition will in turn lead again to the security affairs of the two peoples being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . <p>
