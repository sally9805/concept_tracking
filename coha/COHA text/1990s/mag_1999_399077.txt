Section : Personal tech We clicked . We culled . And we found the sites that are really worth visiting <p> As the Web grows , it grows more confusing . Here are the sites that will make your life easier and , sometimes , just a bit more fun . Entertainment ATOMFILMS <p> ( www.atomfilms.com ) <p> WHAT MAKES IT GREAT : Most sites offering short films and Web casts are dismal  --  think bad public-access cable in a postage-stamp-size window . AtomFilms posts only its best submissions , and its generous viewing window ( a smaller window is available for those with slow connections ) makes the films watchable . Among the most popular are crass spoofs and an interactive cartoon of a foul-mouthed gerbil in a microwave . But more refined viewers will enjoy beautifully executed shorts that make the most of the format , creating little gems of film that pack a whole story arc into a few moments . Check out Bobby Loves Mangos , a not-quite sci-fi film that thumbs its nose at the time-travel genre , and Short , a wry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strong-stomached could try Kitchen Sink , a horror short that will make you think twice before pulling a hairball out of a drain . <p> TRIED AND TRUE : The venerable Internet Movie Database ( www.imdb.com ) is still the best for researching films ( and settling bets ) . Users can search for character name , crew member , or any number of trivial data points . Recent upgrades include movie showtimes and trailers for recent films . <p> WORTH A CLICK : MovieLens ( movielens . umn.edu ) recommends films with eerie accuracy . Users rate films in the database , which spits out suggestions based on users with similar preferences . Alas , the site is so popular that it 's sometimes down or too crowded to use . Music/M SONICNET <p> ( www.sonicnet.com ) <p> WHAT MAKES IT GREAT : A truly great Internet music site would take advantage of all the great resources the Web has to offer : streaming radio and music video , downloadable M songs , archives of record reviews , and music news updates . While no one site offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modem sing . <p> The smartly designed , massive site , largely focused on rock and pop music , is set up so that you can use it two ways . If you want to know more about resurrected guitar great Carlos Santana , simply type Santana in the " Find Music " box on the front page . You get a page that gives you links to recent news stories , fan sites , and reviews of his albums . If you 're more in the mood for checking out what 's new , Sonicnet offers the latest music videos from Bush to Britney Spears and audio broadcasts ranging from alternative rock to hip-hop . <p> Sonicnet 's one weakness is that it does n't offer much in the way of M music downloads from its site , nor does it direct you to other decent M sites . <p> TRIED AND TRUE : Though it 's better known for its streaming audio software that makes it possible to listen to continuous music feeds on the Web , Real.com 's Web site is worthy of attention on its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often features some of the best downloads of music from prominent artists , such as Nine Inch Nails ' " We 're in This Together Now . " <p> WORTH A CLICK : It makes sense that electronica music  --  a term for the many genres of pulsing , computer-precise dance music deejays make with drum machines , audio samplers , and synthesizers  --  would thrive on the Internet . With two alternating , live-feed Web cams , Groovetech.com puts you in the deejay booth , letting you listen to and watch deejays mix it up all day long . Humor MCSWEENEY 'S <p> ( www.mcsweeneys.net ) <p> WHAT MAKES IT GREAT : A text-only Best site ? Impossible . ( OK , it has one graphic . ) McSweeney 's is a genre-defying journal of humor , featuring short stories , nonfiction , and the occasional interview . McSweeney 's pokes at media culture with a sharp stick . Short items , like " Top Ten Most Censored Press Releases , " offer quick absurdity fixes . But long-form parodies of highbrow writing are the site 's forte . Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Week at Sea : A True Story "  --  the perfect antidote to the **26;1776;TOOLONG subgenre . <p> TRIED AND TRUE : After 10 years and a bestselling book , The Onion ( www.theonion.com ) continues to deliver brutally funny USA Today-style parody headlines , but longtime readers will notice that certain formulas are repeating themselves . <p> WORTH A CLICK : The home page of the Van Gogh-Goghs ( www.vgg.com ) , a Los Angeles sketch comedy troupe , is a bright spot in the sophomoric mush that is online humor .

The site then tells you the odds you will meet your financial goal and what specific steps you need to take to make it happen .

There is also easy access to the Associated Press wires , which come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRIED AND TRUE : Yahoo.com may be the most useful because it regularly adds topics and sources of information . It also makes a great home page . ABCnews.com could be the best of the TV-network sites because it is fast on its feet . But for tracking storms , Weather.com , run by the Weather Channel , stands out . For sheer fun and a great catalog of gossip sites , check out Obscurestore.com . <p> WORTH A CLICK : Ecola.com has an extensive catalog of news sites from around the world . The problem is you have to click back and forth to visit your favorites . Quickbrowse.com has the potential to be a truly innovative site for news junkies . You select the regional newspapers and , every day , it collects them so you read can them all in one spot . But it needs more newspapers and magazines .

But their search engines are still useful if you already have an idea of where you want to go . <p> WORTH A CLICK : Mamma.com , the " Mother of All Search Engines , " runs your request on several of the major search engines simultaneously and gives you the best links they found .

His reviews and essays choose eclectic spots before they get trendy . Though Leff mainly covers New York City , the site 's extensive regional message boards are choked with passionate advice from other chowhounds .

It does n't have the depth of guidance at insure.com , and its mission is to close deals . But it excels at comparing prices and terms from many firms . Checklists help determine if health factors bar you from a specific life policy . <p> WORTH A CLICK : QuickenInsurance ( www.insuremarket.com ) asks about such things as your blood pressure , cholesterol , sports activity , and driving record . There 's even a query about travel to underdeveloped nations . The result can be an accurately customized life quotation .

Careerbuilder is n't perfect , but it is the closest thing yet to that job-hopper 's holy grail .

That 's why many recruiters and job seekers are migrating to niche sites . The techies are going first , naturally . Sites like Dice.com , Techies.com , and Techjobbank.com are booming . And for the dreamers , there 's always Coolworks.com , which lists adventure jobs such as park ranger , and the self-explanatory Sixfigurejobs.com . <p> WORTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you want to work for the company . Sites like Vault.com ( www.vaultreports.com ) and Topica.com serve as virtual water coolers , allowing Web surfers to listen in on office gossip . Register for the Walt Disney World Gripes group through Topica , for example , and eavesdrop on employees of the Magical Kingdom . You 'll learn that some workers feel their fellow Disney staff members who dress up like Goofy and Minnie are snobby and too good to talk to anyone . Real estate HOMESTORE <p> ( www.homestore.com ) <p> WHAT MAKES IT GREAT : Homestore wants to be the portal for anyone buying , selling , renting , or remodeling a home . It 's got comprehensive primers full of advice for those endeavors . But the real lure may be the convenience of searching over 90 percent of listed properties on the related Realtor.com . The site , run by the National Association of Realtors , has more traffic than the combined number of visitors to the next four in the segment , according to Media Matrix , which measures Web traffic . <p> TRIED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the increase in visitors . Although the site has fewer listings than does Realtor.com  --  750,000 compared with some 1.3 million  --  HomeAdvisor has more homes in specific markets . The site also objectively matches homeowners with mortgages that are chosen from among 13 lenders . <p> WORTH A CLICK : Home sellers who want to avoid an agent 's commission  --  which is pushing beyond 6 percent in most areas of the country  --  should consider listing their homes on Owners.com .
