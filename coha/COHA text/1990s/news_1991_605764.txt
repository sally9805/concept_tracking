<p> A convict who walked away from a D.C. halfway house last month was charged yesterday with felony murder in the death of a 4-year-old girl struck by a Jeep that was attempting to elude police Monday . <p> A second man , believed to be the driver of the stolen vehicle , was to be presented in D.C. Superior Court today in connection with the death of Elaina Lydia Puerta , officials said . <p> The girl and her 14-year-old brother , Juan Carlos Zuluaga , were struck as they waited for a bus on 16th Street near Park Road NW , in the Mount Pleasant section . <p> The incident , which had begun minutes earlier with a routine traffic infraction , ended in tragedy for a tightknit family of Colombian immigrants who had left the Mount Pleasant neighborhood to avoid crime . <p> Relatives said the family , which had moved one mile south to the Dupont Circle area a month ago , had not yet found a babysitter in their new neighborhood and were relying on one in Mount Pleasant . <p> The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorted home by her brother . <p> " This little girl has to become a symbol of all the injustices that are going on in the streets , " said an uncle , Audsberto Puerta . " Washington used to be a nice place to live . But now it 's dangerous . " <p> After the accident , which occurred about 4:30 p.m. , the mother , Nidia Puerta , 35 , was brought to view the body of her daughter , a relative said . She gently kissed her daughter and asked that she give her strength , said a brother who witnessed the scene . Then the mother walked to another room in Children 's Hospital to tell her son  --  who was in serious condition  --  that his little sister was dead . <p> The boy later told his family that when he saw the Jeep coming at them , he grabbed his sister , and that was all he remembered of the incident . <p> As the family prepared for a burial , authorities outlined the series of events that began with two purse-snatchings allegedly carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , 22 , and Eugene Baker Scott , 21 . <p> The two men , both recently released from the Lorton Correctional Complex , were driving a Jeep that was reported stolen five days earlier . Aside from their alleged role in the robberies , the two men were also wanted on arrest warrants for escaping from the D.C. Department of Corrections system . <p> Starting about 4 p.m . Johnson and Scott allegedly robbed women at two different locations in Northwest and then fled in the Jeep , according to a court affidavit . Just 17 minutes after the first purse snatching  --  in an accident of timing that set off the pursuit  --  the Jeep ran a stop sign at 17th and Newton streets NW , in plain view of two U.S. Park Police officers . <p> One of the officers turned on the cruiser 's flashing lights and siren  --  attempting to stop the driver of the Jeep for the traffic violation , authorities said . <p> Park Police officials said yesterday that the officer followed the department 's guidelines . The officer , who gave first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was suffering from stress and placed on leave after the incident , a Park Police official said . <p> District and Park Police officials yesterday said the accident should not be likened to others that result from police chases . Maj. Robert Hines , a spokesman for the Park Police , said the pursuit was less than four blocks and did not exceed 35 miles an hour . For at least half that distance , Hines said , the officer did not know the driver was purposely eluding him . <p> Moreover , the background of the two men made it likely that they would flee at the first sign of police intervention . Deputy Chief Melvin Clark , the commander of the 4th District , said the fact that both men were wanted would " automatically spook them and get them running . " <p> Police later found a black purse and credit cards in the Jeep , according to the affidavit , and a routine check of the license plate would have revealed that the vehicle was stolen . <p> Corrections officials said Johnson was placed on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conviction for auto theft . On Sept. 26 , after Johnson failed to keep an appointment with his counselor , he was classified as an escapee . <p> Scott was sentenced to one to three years in February after he pleaded guilty to robbery and failing to appear in court . He has been sought since he walked away from a Southeast halfway house Nov. 26 , a day after he was transferred there from Lorton . <p> Scott was presented last night in D.C. Superior Court on charges of felony murder , robbery , attempted robbery , unauthorized use of a vehicle and escape . He was ordered held without bail , pending a hearing on Dec. 23 . Felony murder is a murder committed in the furtherance of another felony , in this case the robberies . <p> Monday 's accident was the latest in a series of incidents that began with police pursuits . In response to six traffic fatalities involving police chases this year , District police issued an order two weeks ago that allows pursuits only in cases where officers suspect the person has committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order is in line with restrictions imposed by other large police departments across the country , where fatalities and the lawsuits that inevitably result have forced changes in police procedures . <p> The Park Police regulations governing chases fall under a broad category governing the proper use of emergency vehicles . Officers are instructed to act in a manner " consistent with the safety and welfare of the public and other officers . " <p> Such guidelines rely heavily on an officer 's discretion . In Monday 's case , the Park Police officer decided to pull over the Jeep after it failed to stop at 17th and Newton streets NW . Park Police officers are not required to enforce traffic regulations in the District , and it is up to the officer to decide . <p> Park Police officials , after reviewing the case and interviewing the officer , concluded yesterday that the department 's guidelines had been followed . <p> But advocates of stringent control say it is bad policy to allow officers discretion on police chases . Hubert Williams , the president of the Police Foundation , maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat that they must be used only in the most extreme cases . " The criminal act has to be sufficiently grave to put the public at risk , " Williams said . <p> According to Park Police , the events unfolded as follows : <p> The driver of the Jeep ignored the officer 's warning lights , continued on Newton , and then turned left onto Mount Pleasant Street , a busy thoroughfare . Hines said the officer , on the force for four years , at one point told the dispatcher that the Jeep failed to heed his siren . <p> Mount Pleasant and Park Road , the Jeep went through another stop sign and then headed east on Park Road , which at that stretch is for westbound traffic only . The officer followed about half a block and then , realizing that the Jeep was out of sight , turned off the siren and halted the pursuit . <p> By that time , the Jeep had turned right on 16th Street and collided with a Ford Taurus driven by Thomas Charles Field , 52 . The crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two children . <p> Four-year-old Elaina , who loved to sing and got a thrill out of answering the telephone , was the center of affection for the Puertas , a family that includes eight brothers and three sisters , most of whom live in the region . <p> " We all loved her . She was beautiful , " said Audsberto Puerta , who found out about the accident while at work and took the girl 's mother to Children Hospital . <p> The little girl was the center of family attention at Thanksgiving and on her birthday , Dec. 7 . <p> All of the family had already purchased doll accessories for Elaina for Christmas , including the doll house she wanted . <p> " There 's no more Christmas this year , " her uncle said . " My brother who bought her the doll house had to go to the doctor today because this thing hurt him so much . He loved her too much .
