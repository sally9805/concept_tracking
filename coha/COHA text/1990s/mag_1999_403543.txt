Infection may be the spice of planktonic life . // The thousands of pinpoints of light against the blackness made it easy to imagine I was in a spaceship traveling through the far reaches of the galaxy . What I was looking at were not stars , however , but the DNA of viruses in seawater , magnified a thousand times and glowing under the blue light of the epifluorescence microscope . Observations on the abundance and dynamics of such virus particles have been changing our understanding of the world 's oceans . That the oceans teem with viruses was discovered only a decade ago by Lita Proctor , a graduate student working in microbial ecologist Jed Fuhrman 's laboratory at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , and  --  at virtually the same time-by a group working with Gunnar Bratbak , professor of microbiology at the University of Bergen in Norway . I was doing postdoctoral work in Fuhrman 's laboratory at the time and had a chance to witness the unfolding drama . These researchers were finding that each teaspoonful of seawater typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the next most numerous inhabitants of the typical teaspoonful : bacteria ( also known as bacterioplankton ) . Electron microscopy revealed that viruses are not only abundant but also diverse in appearance . Many of the small ones resemble lunar landers , with polygonal " heads " and little jointed " legs " attached to " tails " ; others are much larger and have no tails . Each virus , consisting of genetic material encapsulated in a protein shell , is so small that it would take about 23 billion of them-or about four times the number of people on the earth  --  to make a visible particle . Once it was demonstrated that viruses are an enormous presence in the sea , the next step was to assess their effect on marine ecosystems . In 1988 I began to explore these issues at the University of Texas along with Amy Chan , my research associate and spouse , and Matthew Cottrell , then a first-year doctoral student . Since 1996 Amy and I have conducted similar research at the University of British Columbia , in Vancouver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the life and death of bacterioplankton , phytoplankton , and microzooplankton-the one-celled organisms that drift with the currents on the surface of the open ocean . Staple items of the food web , plankton are the producers and recyclers of most of the energy that flows through oceanic ecosystems . Viruses are not alive , in the sense that they have no metabolism when outside a host , and they can reproduce only by infecting living organisms . When a virus injects its DNA into a cell , it hijacks that cell 's replication machinery and produces scores or hundreds of new viral particles . These rupture the host and are released into the environment to find new victims . In a multicellular animal such as a human , a viral invasion does not always result in serious illness , much less death , but for a single-celled planktonic organism , the process of viral replication is generally lethal . Some viruses , known as lysogenic phages , add a twist to this life cycle . Once they insert their DNA into the host cell 's genetic material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replicate themselves , but their genes are duplicated each time the host cell divides . Only an environmental cue such as exposure to sunlight or a sudden temperature changewill trigger their own replication process . At that point , however , the virus leaves the host , sometimes absconding with some of the host 's genetic material .. Now the virus becomes a genetic engineer : when it infects its next host , it does so with a combination of its own and the previous host 's DNA . In this way , a virus may shunt DNA from individual to individual and between populations . ( Fortunately , most viruses are limited to particular hosts , so this kind of commerce is limited to a few closely related species-bacteria of a single genus , for example . ) What we did n't know when we began our work was the extent of viral effects on sea life . We knew the marine viruses were abundant , but that did not necessarily mean they had a great impact . Many viruses are extremely stable in water , so it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting around for years without infecting other organisms . If so , a very high concentration of viruses was being maintained by a very low rate of infection . Another possibility was that a great proportion of the viruses we were observing had been rendered harmless , owing to damage from exposure to sunlight or from other unknown causes . A third possibility was what we were expecting : that their abundance meant they were constantly infecting other organisms . // Opposite : Under the epifluorescence microscope , the marine bacteria Synechococcus glow pink or red . Those with blue halos have hundreds of viruses attached to their surfaces . // We decided to pursue a hunch that many of the viruses were pathogens of **31;703;TOOLONG organisms such as cynobacteria , small flagellates , and other unicells that form the base of the food web in the ocean . Other researchers had primarily focused on non-photosynthesizing bacteria as potential host organisms , but a number of observations suggested that phytoplankton were also important targets of infection . For one , viruslike particles had been found in many different types of phytoplankton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And researchers Jolie Mayer and Max Taylor , of the University of British Columbia , had managed to isolate a virus from infected phytoplankton in the late 1970s . Finally , anecdotal reports in scientific journals had described the sudden disappearance of phytoplankton blooms from various areas of the ocean 's surface . Although viruses had not been implicated , these disappearances were consistent with the rapid spread of a viral infection . Based on these reports , we decided to see if we could demonstrate an infectious connection between phytoplankton and any viruses we might find in their neighborhood . To our surprise , we found that viruses flourished widely-off the coasts of New York , Texas , California , and British Columbia and in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico . In fact , we isolated them from every coastal seawater sample we examined . Moreover , we determined that such viruses were having a significant impact on ecologically important groups of phytoplankton . At times , viruses infecting a single strain of phytoplankton were present at concentrations in excess of one billion per liter . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean-they survived only hours or days-and that their numbers fluctuated dramatically from season to season . To reach the high densities we saw in some of our samples , they would have to be constantly replicating-something that could happen only if infection was a common occurrence . If , on average , one billion viruses per liter were being produced and destroyed every few days , then on any given day , about 20 percent of the single  --  celled organisms in the ocean were in the process of being killed by viral infection . // In a satellite image , the greatest chlorophyll densities in the oceans are shown in red . // Using mathematical models , we calculated that in the sea , this translates into probably one-half or more of the total mortality of non-photosynthetic bacteria and a significant component of the phytoplankton mortality . It has been estimated that the combined weight of all the bacterioplankton exceeds the total weight of all the other organisms in the ocean . Therefore , if 20 percent of marine bacterioplankton are being destroyed by viral infection each day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Carbon-the common currency of plankton and all other living things-is not , as we had previously thought , always directly transferred from one living organism to another as they consume ( and are consumed by ) others in the food web . Instead , a good proportion of the carbon from living organisms is released into the sea by dying bacterioplankton and may subsequently be reincorporated by other bacteria and then largely lost ( that is , converted to carbon dioxide gas ) through respiration . Alternatively , the released carbon may remain in the water , contributing to the large pool of dissolved organic matter in the ocean . Do viruses therefore have a role in converting carbon into greenhouse gases-a factor in global warming ? Although we do not yet know much about the indirect effects of marine viruses on the atmosphere , researchers in the United States and Europe have shown that the killing of some phytoplankton by viruses releases large quantities of dimethyl sulfoxide , an intermediate compound in the production of the very potent greenhouse gas **26;736;TOOLONG . Sea viruses play another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as agents of biodiversity . Because viruses specialize in invading particular hosts , their presence prevents any one kind of plankton from dominating the ocean environment . As soon as a particular planktonic host reaches a high concentration , the virus specializing in that species will be able to sweep rapidly through the host population . ( A similar phenomenon happens among children each fall , when their return to school en masse creates an opportunity for the sudden spread of colds and flu . ) Infection quickly knocks down that species ' numbers , creating an opportunity for the other types of plankton to increase theirs . As a consequence , viruses ensure that the planktonic soup of the ocean is a mix of many species . Marine viruses , of course , infect more than just plankton . Cultivated stocks of crabs , oysters , mussels , clams , shrimp , salmon , and catfish , for example , are all susceptible to viruses , and such infections have caused enormous losses in the aquaculture industry . The mere existence of infective viral species in cultured populations argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How great this role is , we do not know . The collapse of a herring stock reported in Alaska in 1993 was known to be caused by a virus . An epidemic of a previously unknown distemper virus in 1988 resulted in the death of more than 18,000 harbor seals in northern Europe . A few years later , infected seals were discovered along New York 's Long Island . Related viruses have also been found in dolphins and porpoises . The similarity of these to the distemper viruses that infect dogs and ruminants has raised concerns about the potential for introducing terrestrial viruses into marine populations . But it would be a mistake to look at sea viruses as mere pathogens that destroy other life . They are , rather , essential to the running of the marine ecosystem 's engine . This was dramatically shown in an experiment in which we selectively removed viruses from seawater and measured the growth rates of the remaining planktonic organisms . We expected to see growth rates increase dramatically as the organisms were freed from viral infection . Much to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not realized was that the living organisms in the water depended on the nutrients released as other organisms were killed off . Without the death of phytoplankton at the hands of viruses , there was no fuel to keep the engine running . Given that a decade ago , marine viruses were not even considered to be of consequence , all of these discoveries represent a major shift in our understanding of the ecology of the sea .
