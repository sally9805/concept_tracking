( Disclosures and Offers ) <p> David Bunch 's highly unusual , highly distinctive , highly odd stories have been assembled in Moderan and more recently in Bunch ! He lives in St. Louis and views the world in a very strange manner . Witness the following modest proposal concerning ploughshares and swords and mergers thereof . <p> Dragons ! all ! ! from this table in this room , where I sit long at rest and much in pondering , after the lateliest ( and wearying ) ride of the Guardsman 's rounds , I would write to you . I have some disclosures that I 'd like to share with you , leading to bright offers of the most extraordinary ! dimensions ! ! But first  --  I grapple-and-lock a burden that I have to cast afar  --  from God , through me-and-you  --  and burst-to-wide the very Gates of Sin ! on Conscience Dungeon : I 'm really only a part-time Saint Knight World Guardian for Dragon . Threats ( SKWGFDT ) . There are other , and many-counted very bad things that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roars  --  your trademarks !  --  ( On my best pious day of all in the Guardians , I still scored " not perfect " not " saintly " enough ) . <p> Are you surprised  --  DRAGONS ? ! I am prepared to accept that you are surprised , at this , coming from ME ( a Saint George ) , to YOU  --  considering my " saintliness , " my relentlessness , my record to date overall , and the fact that I have hunted you on all the fields known to Western Civilized Man . Pursued you almost as if you were , completely , Sin itself .  --  NOW DRAGONS , if some of you , or even all of you , have a like Surprise to spring , and would wish to " come out , " burst right forth right now ! and " rip to tatters " the Cave Dark ( in a manner of speaking ) , being only part-time Dragons ( closet cave ! Good Guys ) , and long I have surmised this might be so , I swear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETTER SIDE ! " <p> And I feel I should take heed the blotching pussed dark marks of my soul and make confession , here at my time of trying to BE what I am driven finally to be , ( and conscience shrieking under the ceaseless flog ) : Sometimes , even with your blood still wetting darker that contended ground where I had felled you , while of your proud-fighter 's fire ( your born-of Nature burning ) , there remained only the thinnest gossamer strands of the smoke of dying  --  I had questioned ME : Have I conquered a really old-bad Dragon , an all-wrong Ogre , a completely depraved and no-hopes for-redemption Reptile ? Or should not we , somehow between us long ago , have arranged ourselves toward some better mindset and an accommodation of our differing ways ? Each for the other ? Rather than for ME/YOU to try to slay US , or by other means attempt to overcome US-all the days ? <p> Let me toss three questions out there at you then  --  while a groom rubs down , curries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy and salting-raw-sores hot in summer and in winter the like load clammy and cold ) lies now as busy insect housing in the grass beneath a tree . My tough shield leans at that same tree , near to my armor ( likewise my great sword and my Dragon lance ) , and on that shield where it rests , caught in the dapple-shade of a middle-summer afternoon , raw marks ( slashed in ! ) in the dented steel all-clearly tell the price of fights . ( And starkly too they witness that I rode or , burly-rough and lanceless stood and " fought the sword " , many Blood Days  --  while the Courts of Death ruled sternly on the depths-and-skills of wounds on the Dragon-Claws Fields. )  --  Horse , armor , lance , sword , shield , Death  --  and you , Dragons  --  have these not been our Life and Times ... the World 's Life and Times ... too often , too much of days , too many nights ... brave and unkind ... ? Question number two : Though myriad the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we not essentially exactly where we were  --  WHERE WE WERE  --  lance points out , claws set for carving ... all of us too ready to BEat-War  --  that Anger which exalts " dying from one 's wounds " and inters entire generations ? And Question numbering three : Should not the just above TELL US SOMETHING TO THINK A WHOLE LOT ABOUT , DRAGONS ? <p> SO  --  let US take time free from our Conflict Times to have ourselves a party !  --  an Others-understanding celebration ! one of fun and also full of fellowship and mellow good regard for the feelings of Everything that breathes of Life in the Great Room of our coming together . Oh , there we 'll be ! self-proclaimed Saints and world-wreck-it-down Dragons , ready to laugh and yell , josh it up for fun and play games  --  together ! What a sight ! THAT 'll make  --  self-appointed Saint Knights world-guardian , now unarmed , our armor and shields and sword/lances all heaped in a for-junkroom pile ; and Dragons ( with their flames down-doused to a glow ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ( in a much-clearer-than-hint self-abasement ) that I mean this closely , I 'll bring the Saint George dart boards , those that I wrested from your cruelest Dragon 's cave one furious questing killfiercest afternoon I caught him where he chortled and Dragon-crowed at killing my ! head , my saintly head ! all the way off . Fang-darts and clawdaggers were splintery mayhem  --  right through the lumber !  --  And you too can play the dart-board games at my " drawn pretty " head ( all in sport of course ) at this Others-understanding party we are going to have , and I 'll just smile you friendly . And maybe I 'll get back at you with some neat-clean-new parlor tricks to do with smoke and flame and roars  --  your forte ( but all fun stuff NOW , no burn-downs ) , that you will teach  --  <p> LET 'S DO IT , DRAGONS ! What have we to lose ? What we have done as hostiles all these dying-and-wounded warring centuries  --  BATTLED  --  has not brought forth a better world one tittle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , One-and-All , when I cry : THINGS DO BUT GET ODDER ALL THE TIME ! I do not shout to jest . <p> DO let me hear ( the soonest that you can ) , Dragons !  --  old familiar Monsters/Enemies that after all-these-years of close-fight and sore-hurt must seem almost , or quite ! my other living selves  --  and nearly beloved . Reply about the main-line points I make and my offer to stop fighting . - An Others-understanding get-together ? WELL  --  that certainly ca n't kill us any more perilously than we already are . Can it ? ! <p> ( Gifts follow for all the little Dragons . ) Yours , George , SKWGFDT  --  ( retired ) PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Would I blow smoke ! " <p> <p> <p> By David R.
