Sometimes it seems that everybody is trying to tell you when and how the world is supposed to end . Some scenarios are more familiar than others . Those that are widely discussed in the media include rampant infectious disease , nuclear war , collisions with asteroids or comets , and environmental destruction . While different in origin , each can induce the end of the human species and other life forms on Earth . Note that implicit in such slogans as " Save the Earth " is the egocentric call to save life on Earth , not the planet itself . Of course , humans can not really kill Earth . Earth will remain in orbit around the Sun , along with its planetary brethren , long after Homo sapiens has become extinct from whatever cause . Less familiar but more likely end-of-the-world scenarios can be invoked to describe the ending of our temperate planet . I offer these prognostications , not because humans are likely to live long enough to observe them but because the tools of astrophysics enable me to calculate them . Three that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impending collision between our Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy , and the thermal death of the universe , about which the community of astrophysicists has recently achieved some consensus . Computer models of stellar evolution are like cosmic actuarial tables . They indicate a healthy , 10-billion-year life expectancy for our Sun . At its present estimated age of 5 billion years , the Sun should have another 5 billion years of relatively stable energy output . By then , if we have not figured out a way to leave Earth , we will bear witness to a remarkable evolutionary change in our star as it simply runs out of fuel . The Sun owes its stability to the controlled fusion of hydrogen into helium in its 15-million-degree core . The gravity that wants to collapse the star is held in check by the outward gas pressure , which is sustained by the high temperatures . While more than 90 percent of the Sun 's atoms are hydrogen , the only ones that matter are those in the core . When the core is exhausted of these atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of helium nuclei . These require a higher temperature than does hydrogen to carry on fusion reactions . Now out of balance , gravity wins , and the inner regions of the star collapse . The Sun 's core temperature then rises to 100 million degrees , which triggers the fusion of helium into carbon . In the process , the Sun 's luminosity grows astronomically , and its outer layers expand to mind-boggling proportions , engulfing the orbits of Mercury and Venus . Eventually , the Sun will swell to occupy the entire sky as its expansion swallows the orbit of Earth . This will be bad . The temperature on Earth will rise until it equals that of the 3,000-degree rarefied outer layers of the expanded Sun . Our oceans will boil off , and the atmosphere will evaporate away into interplanetary space as Earth becomes a red-hot , charred ember in an unstable orbit deep within the Sun . Eventually , the Sun will cease all nuclear fusion , lose its spherical , tenuous , gaseous envelope , and expose its dying central core . Scenarios such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a global priority . Not long after the Sun terrorizes Earth , the Milky Way will encounter some problems of its own . Of the hundred thousand galaxies whose velocities relative to the Milky Way has been measured , only a few are moving toward us ; all the rest are moving away at a speed directly related to their distances from us . Discovered in the 1920s by Edwin Hubble ( for whom the Hubble Space Telescope was named ) , the general recession of galaxies is the observational signature of our expanding universe . The Milky Way and the **28;236;TOOLONG Andromeda galaxy are close enough to each other that their mutual gravity overwhelms the effect of the expanding universe . We happen to be drifting toward each other at about 100 kilometers per second , nearly a quarter million miles per hour . If our ( unknown ) sideways motion is small , then at this rate , the 2.2-million light-year distance that separates us will shrink to zero in about 6 billion years . Interstellar space is so vast , there is no need to fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun . During the galaxy-galaxy encounter ( which would be a spectacular sight from a safe distance ) , stars are more than likely to pass by one another . But the event would not be worry-free . Some of Andromeda 's stars may swing close enough to our solar system to influence the orbits of planets and the hundreds of billions of resident comets . Such close stellar flybys can throw gravitational allegiances into question as planets are stolen by the interlopers in " flyby lootings " or are unbound and flung forth into interstellar space . Remember how choosy Goldilocks was with other people 's porridge ? If we are stolen by the gravity of another star , we have no guarantee that our new-found orbit will be at the right distance to sustain liquid water on Earth 's surface , which is generally agreed to be a prerequisite to sustaining life as we know it . Too close to a star and our water supply evaporates . Too far , and it freezes solid . Even if , by some miracle of future technology , our planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps by churning fresh hydrogen down to the core ) , their efforts will be rendered irrelevant if Earth is flung into space . The absence of a nearby energy source will allow Earth 's surface temperature to drop to hundreds of degrees below zero Fahrenheit . This will also be bad . After the oceans freeze , our cherished atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen and other gases will first liquefy and then solidify , encrusting the Earth like icing on a cake . We will freeze before we have a chance to starve . The last life forms on Earth will be those privileged organisms that had evolved to rely not on the Sun 's energy but on geothermal sources , where the heat of Earth 's interior escapes from the crust . At the moment , humans are not in this select group . Of course , we can move to other planets that are in orbit around healthy stars in other galaxies . But the long-term fate of the cosmos can not be postponed or avoided . No matter where you hide , you will be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest and best evidence on the density of matter in space and the expansion rate of the universe suggests that we are on a one-way trip and that the collective gravity of everything in the universe is insufficient to halt and then reverse the cosmic expansion . Currently , the most successful description of the universe and its origin combines our modern understanding of gravity ( Einstein 's general theory of relativity ) with the big bang . Shortly after the big bang , the universe was a trillion-degree maelstrom of matter mixed with energy , affectionately known as the primordial soup . During the 14-billion-year expansion that followed , the background temperature has dropped to a mere 3 degrees on the absolute ( kelvin ) temperature scale . As the universe continues to expand , this temperature will continue to get closer and closer to absolute zero . The steadily dropping background temperature does not now directly affect us on Earth because our Sun grants us a cozy life . But as each generation of stars is born from the interstellar gas clouds of the galaxy , less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually , the gas supply will run out  --  as it already has in a third of the galaxies in the universe . The rare stars with the highest mass will collapse completely , never to be seen again . Slightly less massive stars will end their lives by blowing their guts across the galaxy in a supernova explosion . This returned gas can then be tapped for another generation of stars . But the majority of stars  --  our Sun included  --  ultimately exhaust the fuel at their cores and , after the bulbous giant phase , collapse to form a compact orb of matter that quickly radiates its feeble , leftover heat to the frigid universe . The list of corpses contains familiar objects : black holes , neutron stars ( pulsars ) , white dwarfs , and brown dwarfs are all dead ends on the evolutionary tree of stars . What they have in common is an eternal lock on cosmic construction materials . In other words , if stars burn out and no new ones replace them , then the universe will eventually contain no living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun for a daily infusion of energy to sustain life . If the Sun and the energy from all other stars are cut off from us , then mechanical and chemical processes ( life included ) on Earth will " wind down . " Eventually , the energy of all motion will be lost through friction , and the system will reach a single , uniform temperature . This will really be bad . The starless Earth will lie naked in the presence of the frozen background of the expanding universe . The Earth will lose its heat the way a freshly baked pie cools on a window sill . Yet Earth is not alone in this fate . Trillions of years into the future , when all stars are cold and every process in every nook and cranny of the expanding universe has wound down , all parts of the cosmos will have cooled to the same temperature as the ever-cooling background . At that time , space travel will no longer provide refuge . We may then declare that the universe has died  --  not with a bang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astrophysicist , is the Frederick P. Rose Director of New York City 's Hayden Planetarium and a research scientist at Princeton University . <p>
