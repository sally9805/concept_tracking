For Katie Monahan Prudent , a champion equestrian , the road to Atlanta begins beside her farm in Middleburg , Virginia . From the front porch of her early-19th-century home , she looks across the lawn with its tall , shady trees to a stretch of U.S. 50 . If she goes to the Games next summer , she 'll turn east on the highway , then south , just two more turns on a long trip that began in 1969 when she was 15 . That year she won the Maclay Finals at The National Horse Show , a competition in which the young winners are considered the riders of tomorrow . And over the next two decades and into a third , Katie rode jumpers to the top of her athletic field , winning enough plaques and trophies to fill a barn and enough prize money to buy her farm in the horse country of northern Virginia . In the 1980s she was thrice named the leading lady rider in the world by the Federation Equestre International , the only woman ever to achieve that status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  a medal for the United States at the Olympic Games . And for that , Katie is still a rider of tomorrow . The eternal flame of competition still drives her toward that goal of gold in Atlanta . That flame burns a little lower on this day . A soft mist enshrouds the emerald fields of her Plain Bay Farm when we catch Katie in a rare moment  --  at home . She spends nearly 45 weeks a year on the road in America and Europe , where she performs in shows and teaches students who travel to meet her . Today , this fiercely competitive athlete has paused in her training , and there 's a big smile on her face . She has dressed her son , Adam ( age 5 ) , in his riding coat , jodhpurs , and boots , and she leads him around the ring on his pony . " Adam has been riding since before he was born , " Katie says later . " I was competing in Europe when I was five months pregnant . And he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up on a horse . " In 1982 , Katie met Henri Prudent of France , who buys and trains horses and also jumps . They dated back and forth between Europe and America , married in 1986 , and since then have made Virginia their home . Then two events occurred to bring major changes to Katie 's life . Adam was born in 1989 and Katie nearly died a few months later . In the parlor of her Virginia home , Katie slips out of her riding boots , sips coffee , and watches as the mist turns to rain . " Once we made a decision to have a child , I knew that would put things on hold a bit , " she recalls . " But I 'm such a positive thinker . I rode up to the seventh month and was back in the saddle a couple of months after Adam was born . I felt great . " Then at a winter meet in Florida in 1990 , she fell twice in one day , collapsing after the second fall . Rushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the night . It took her a long time to recover from the head injuries . " After the accident , I was like a noodle , " she says . " Having to struggle to ride was really hard for me . My whole life it was so easy . All of a sudden it was n't easy  --  it was n't fun . When it 's physically a struggle , it becomes a mental struggle too . But once I got through that , I decided ' yes , I want to ride . ' And from the moment I got up from the hospital bed , I was saying I would compete at the highest level . I had a great tour in Europe last year , and I had a great tour this year . I feel like I 'm back . " Now Katie rides with less of what she calls " the killer instinct . " She remembers , " I hated to lose . I hated to make mistakes . I was driven by that perfectionist attitude . If I did make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughs and looks at Adam playing at her feet . " But I do n't bring it home with me now . When I get home , I 've got this little guy waiting for me with his little smiling face . " Yet she still wants to bring home Olympic gold . Katie was picked for the 1980 U.S. team , which boycotted the Games that year , and she was still recovering from her injuries during the 1932 Games . In ' 84 and ' 88 , she " either had soundness problems or horses that were n't peaking a the right time , " she says . " Unlike many other sports , this sport depends on two athletes , a team , to make it . " The team for 1996 may be Katie and a mare named Tovia . Tovia is 12 , " a perfect age , " Katie says . " She 's much more the athlete than I am . " The big test for Katie and Tovia comes in the trials for selecting the U.S. equestrian team in May of 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association rider of the year three times  --  an achievement no one else has matched . She also won a world championship gold medal in 1986 . But the Olympic gold is down in Atlanta , waiting for her . Katie pauses , looking out at the rain . " After 1980 , after all the bad luck with horses , participating in the Games is one of the few goals that I was n't able to achieve . So yes , I 'd love to do it . Hearing the national anthem brings tears to my eyes . " Katie will be performing for many people if she goes to Atlanta : for George Morris , her mentor who launched her career ; for Henri and for Adam ; and for her great support team at Plain Bay Farm . She steps onto the porch to bid us goodbye . " I love my farm , I love Middleburg . For me , Virginia will always be home . We 'll never sell this farm . We 'll keep it for Adam .
