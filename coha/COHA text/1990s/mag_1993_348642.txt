When the Gallup organization polled the public in May 1991 , less than a third of Americans described journalists as having high ethical standards . If the same poll were conducted now , the results would probably be worse . Ever since NBC last month admitted to significant distortions in a report about safety problems in some General Motors trucks , the media have been awash in shame and penitence . <P> USA Today disciplined its Western editor and apologized in print last week for a " misleading " picture that showed armed Los Angeles youth-gang members ready to retaliate if police officers were again acquitted of beating Rodney King . A former TV reporter and camera operator in Alexandria , Minnesota , admitted to furnishing alcohol to a minor to illustrate a story on teen drinking . NBC itself went back on air with another admission of error , this time for using footage of fish supposedly killed during clear-cutting of timber on government land . In reality , one shot depicted a different forest while another showed fish that were not dead , only stunned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrition , NBC News president Michael Gartner acknowledged that the GM controversy would not die and abruptly resigned last week , saying he hoped to " take the spotlight off of all of us . " <P> To reporters , this spate of confessions is proof that the system of self- regulation works  --  proof that a combination of conscience and competition keeps the press honest . Gartner 's acting successor , Don Browne , even argues that NBC 's pain is resulting in moral renewal in newsrooms around the country . Says Browne : " Journalism will not be diminished but strengthened . Because we made one mistake on Dateline NBC , hundreds of mistakes will not be made elsewhere . " News consumers may be somewhat more skeptical and wonder if journalism has any rules at all . The honest answer : not really . <P> Individual journalists may have highly developed ethical sensibilities . But journalism as a whole , unlike law or medicine , has no licensing procedure , no disciplinary panels , no agreed-upon code of behavior . Practices that are perfectly acceptable to some major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are forbidden at others . At most places , no sin is automatically a firing offense . Editors insist on treating each case individually , which usually translates into permissively . Says USA Today editor Peter Prichard : " It depends on the circumstances , the individual case , the history , all sorts of things . " <P> Even at news outlets with an internal code of conduct  --  such as NBC , where the document runs to 50 pages , or ABC , where it is about 75  --  the rules are commonly described by managers as mere guidelines . Says Richard Wald , who has held senior news posts at both networks : " That 's why we do n't have a list of firing offenses . Ethics is not laid down in tablets  --  it is judgments made over years , and some points are susceptible to change . "
