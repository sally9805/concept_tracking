The Bride Wore Red You 've stayed with Deshi because he is theonly man you ever wanted who did not requirea wife to play dumb to make him feel smarter.Though you are rather small , he is not muchbigger , so in this relationship the big man 's impulse to protect the little girl has been minimal.More : you 've always thought yourself exotic , theone who did n't belong . When you told the boynext door that you were marrying an Indian , he laughed and said , Sally , I always knew you'dend up with a foreigner ; you never could standthe typical American boy . Now you 're with theman you 've always wanted . In a place you don'tbelong . As you step off the plane , in front ofDeshi but close enough so that they 'll knowyou are together , you are confronted by a sea ofswarthy faces peering through the chain links ofthe runway fence . Saris flash color in the yellowishairport lights ; turbans bulge on the heads ofseveral bearded men . You can not guess whichones belong to Deshi . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a smile , therest of his face appearing as bewildered as youfeel . When you turn around again a woman behind the fence is hanging limp in the arms oftwo bearded , turbaned men . " Oh , my God , she'ssick , " says Deshi , and that 's the last you understandas he rushes you into customs . He speaksto an official in a language you do n't understand.You regret that you have not learned thelanguage of his childhood . People are jostling and shoving for theirluggage . You have never seen bigger suitcases inyour life . Skinny boys wheel them in from thetarmac . Thickset men , thin men with paunchesstraining against their silkshirts , roundtripped , greasy-haired women drag the bags across thedusty , concrete floor . The airport smells like across between the subway on a summer afternoonand the spices Deshi uses when he cooksfor you . You 've been awake for forty-sevenhours . Your eyes burn . Your arms and legs ache , craving both movement and inertia at once . It'sthree o'clock in the morning , Delhi time . You and Deshi separate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand the same two men whohad held up the falling woman at the fence.Their stomachs stick out comically , as if they had been successfully implanted with embryos.The woman , not so thin herself , is still strugglingwith them , crying . Deshi does n't have totell you ; she 's his mother . He says something tothe customs agent in his line ; the official looksover his shoulder and turns back to Deshi'spassport with a nod . Deshi runs to his mother , stoops in front of her , and puts his fingers onher feet . Passed into customs , you take a fewsteps toward them . The older manDeshi 's fathermakesa show to lift Deshi off the floor.When Deshi stands , the woman pulls him towardher chest and sobs . Over his shoulder , with her eyes tightly closed , she makes kissingnoises , but her lips make contact only with thehot , dusty air . The men wait . You are not surewho the younger man is . His beard is not asgray , and the flesh on his face is not pulled sotightly by his beard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray andtied beneath his double chin . Deshi introducesyou without telling you who either of them is.The younger one stretches his arm around yourshoulder and you smell his sweat . The old mantries to catch his wife again as she falls to thefloor . Deshi bends over her , speaking softly inPunjabi . The old man pinches her nose ; theyoung man only touches her ankles and shestraightens out her legs . A customs official joinsyou and shouts something in Hindi . He pushesyou closer to the prone woman . She opens hereyes , looks directly into your face , and closes hereyes again . Though you have finished medicalschool , Deshi does not ask for your advice.You 've seen people faint , you 've seen them die.This woman is n't dying ; she has n't even fainted . The men pick her up and walk her outof customs through the double doors , filthy withfinger marks , into the waiting room . As thedoors close behind them , you see that the lobbyis even more crowded than customs . You seethe faces of women , leaning over to look insidethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming . You 'd like toscream yourself at this hour , in this mess . " Doesshe have a preexisting medical condition ? " you ask . Deshi says , " She 's just a little over'emotional . " Your own mother , to your knowledge , has never fainted . The only time you ever sawher cry was the day that Kennedy was shot . Youcame home from school and saw her watching a replay of the Dallas motorcade , a tissue to hereyes . You were baffled . She did n't know thisman . He was a politician ; he had run against anotherpolitician ; a politician had run with him ; there were millions of politicians ready to takehis place . You have been accused of coldness , butthat was only by a roommate who took your lovelife more seriously than you did . That was before you met Deshi . He 's his calm , collected self ashe leads you to the luggage . " I wish I 'd brought my blood pressuresleeve , " you say . " It 's just the shock , " says Deshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . For weeks you tried to convincehim to write a letter to his family explaining thathe and a woman he had known for several yearswere planning to be married and that she wascoming with him on his first trip to New Delhiin ten years . He procrastinated until it was toolate to write . Finally he telephoned , but only totell them what time the plane was landing . Atthe time , you asked , " Why did n't you tell themyou were bringing me ? " " They would n't understand . " Now you understand . You wonder whereyou 'll spend the night , and with more than a littlerelief you realize it 's too late for bed . By thetime your luggage gets through customs , nothingillegal , nothing to declare , it is four A.M.You squeeze through the waiting crowd andfeel around your shoulders the cool , wet arms ofa plump woman . Your first impulse is to shakethem off , but you force yourself to return a littlesqueeze . When you were a baby , your motherhas told you , you refused to be cuddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The womanabandons you just before you scream and smilesthrough the lipstick caked on her crackling lips . " I am the sister , " she says . I am the wife-to-be , you want to say , butyou say , " Hi . I 'm Sally . " Another woman grabs you , thinner thanthe last . You recognize the name of a third sister.Then sister after sister embraces you , all ofthem short and busty like Deshi 's mother . By thetime they 're through , you feel like you 've beengangbanged by a pack of virgins . Deshi 's mother looks at you and goeslimp again , while a sister shouts at her inPunjabi . Another sister lunges for the body ; somany sisters crowd around , it 's a wonder she canbreathe . Someone pinches her nose , straightensher legs , and she moans . " Mummy 's little bitupset , " a sister says smiling . It 's then that you see the small childrenclinging to the sisters ' saris and baggy pants . " What are you doing ? " one says . " Say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not marriedyet , but you 're afraid someone might faint if youso much as mention the M-word . The children cry . One of them turns herface into the sister 's leg . It occurs to you theywould be cute if they were a little leaner . Someof them are wearing earrings ; some you think areboys have long , braided hair . You drag yourself out of the airport whileDeshi , his father , and his brother-in-law guidethe mother outside . Boys in khaki with riflesstand guard . One opens the door of a taxi , andfor a moment you 're afraid all of you mightsqueeze inside . Someone pushes you in . You sitbetween Deshi and one of his sisters , your thighspressed between her soft flesh on the one sideand his bony muscle on the other . One of thechildren , sitting on her mother 's lap , kicks yourknee repeatedly while she sucks her hand . Youused to like children . But four years of collegeand three years of medical school have removedyou thoroughly from them , and you are notlooking forward to your pediatric rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deshi is trying to smile . You smile back , feeling no joy . When his mother starts talking , he loses the smile . " Translate , " you say . He says no . " She is worried that my brother is sothin , " the sister says . You have always suspected that as a childDeshi was force-fed . His fear of overeating borderson the pathological . But you like that.Every other man you 've ever had expected to befed twice as often as you even thought of food.It occurs to you too late to block the thoughtthat Deshi 's sister might be lying to cover up amore devastating comment . Either that , or she'strying to make you feel guilty for starving herbrother . In spite of your better judgment , youfeel guilty . At five o'clock in the morning the airportroad is thick with cars and buses . Men inarmy blankets walk along the weedy shoulders , long staffs in their hands . You are reminded ofthe plodding multitudes in the Bible . A littlescared , you stare , dying to get out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficincreases , especially pedestrians . You drivearound a circle . Billboards as big as drive-inmovie screens advertise fabric , film stars , babyformula . Well-fed , made-up faces stare downat you , a third eye dotted on their foreheads.Deshi 's sisters wear the same red dot above theireyes , smudgy from their sweat . On the morningof your wedding they will paint a dot on yourforehead too , pink because you are so white . Butbefore they consent to your marriage , Deshi'smother must faint a few more times . Every timeshe looks at you . That afternoon you try to take a nap , butit 's cut short by people talking , shouting , evensinging just outside your door . When you stumbleinto an enclosed courtyard in the back ofthe house , you realize that the talking has beencoming from just outside your room . Theyquiet down when you walk in ; the motherfaints . Deshi , who 's been up for two days andlooks it , asks you if you 'd like a drink . You accepteagerly , thinking that even grain alcoholwould n't be strong enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came . " " Are you kidding ? " he says . " My sisterslove you . They 've been on the phone all morning.The wedding 's set . " You 're not sure their plans console you.Deshi pours some beer into a stainless steelcup , explaining , " My aunts are coming over . Itwould n't do to let them know you 're drinking . " As you drain your cup and hold it out formore , it occurs to you that Deshi has n't askedabout wedding arrangements . " I do n't thinkyour mother wants you to marry me , " you say , tempted to give in to a little hysteria of your own . " She 's insisting on it , " Deshi says . " Shethinks we 're already married , and she wants toget us to the temple as fast as possible , so thatwe 'll be married in the eyes of God . " " Tell me about God again , " you say.You 've never had much of a god yourself . Youthink maybe her god might console you . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The truth is , you spend every spare moment in the bathroom , the only place you canbe alone , and every time you look at your remarkablywhite face in the mirror , you burstout crying . You do n't have the solitude to figureout why . There 's only one bathroom . Youdo n't even have the time to wonder what wouldhappen if you washed your face , combed yourhair and walked confidently into the family circlewith the painful announcement that youhave decided not to get married after all because you do n't want children , Deshi already has agreen card , and you 've been enjoying connubialbliss just fine without the approval of God , the family , or the IRS . But you 've come thisfar . You 've got to get it over with before yougo back home , because you do n't know whenyou 're coming here again . But before you can get it over with , youhave to buy the sari . When Deshi 's mother hasrecovered from her fainting spells , she sends oneof her daughters into the bathroom to get you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereyou are going . You trail along , hoping you willsee something of India . They walk you aroundthe comer where an old black taxi waits to driveyou through the crowded streets . The masses ofpedestrians , the reds , blues , oranges , and yellowsof their clothes , the cows , the three-wheeledmotor scooters , rickety old trucks , and boxlikecars turn your neck to rubber by the time youreach the shop , where you sit on the floor whilea well-fed Sikh throws yards of fabric over yourknees , chattering in Punjabi and smiling as hehurls out another six yards . A young boy bringsyou tea , staring through not only your Westernclothing but also your white skin . FinallyDeshi 's mother stops the steady stream of fabric.Her knobbed and gnarled hands smooth a pieceof vermilion silk dotted with golden flowers.You do n't know what she 's saying , but it 's themost upbeat tone she 's used since you met her.You wish the mood would last , but she looksat you and says something glum that makes theshopkeeper and her daughters laugh . You venture an inquiry . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only half a sari will cover you . " You 're flattered . You have been fightingthe superior American diet all your life tomaintain a twenty-two-inch waist , and nowyou will be showing off your midriff just likeDeshi 's sister , whose tires of flesh pour out fromunder her sari blouse as if she did n't know thatpeople were starving in India . In and out of cabs , on the way to sarishops and jewelry stores , you see the starving.Wizened faces stare at you like children , begginghands approach your face . You spend most ofyour time in the house , exhausted by the shopping , wondering where Deshi is while peopleyou do n't know drop by to inspect you . In frontof the house , three steps down from the veranda , beggars congregate , having heard that there willbe a wedding . Your future relatives , afraid thatenvy might destroy your chances to have sons , throw pennies to the ragged . On your wedding day Deshi 's sisters partyour hair in the middle . They insist you line youreyes with kohl , though the black smudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sticky red lipstick . It smells likethe kind you used to steal from your mother'sdresser , and it occurs to you that the last timeyou wore lipstick you were nine years old anddressed in your mother 's white peignoir for agame of " here comes the bride . " After they havesqueezed your breasts into a blouse so tight thatyou can hardly move your arms , so short it doesnot cover all your ribs , you step into a longcotton petticoat , and one of the sistersties its drawstring top so close that you fearfor your circulation . Tucking one end into yourwaist , they wrap the six yards of vermilion silkaround you so that you can not walk withoutstepping on the spun-gold border . You cannotfree your left arm . They bring out a bowl fullof bangles soaked in milk and brush-bum yourknuckles forcing them on . The room is fillingup with chattering , laughing women . Tothe bangles on your wrists they tie gold ornaments , larger versions of the Hindustani earringswith which you used to load down yourearlobes in high school . Now you are ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the temple . Even there , you 're notsure they have n't brought another little guy inhis blue suit , because they 've stuffed his headinto a red turban and covered his face with aveil made out of marigold garlands and goldenfringe . " So no one will give him the evil eye , " asister says , as she draws the end of your sari overyour forehead . At least in India the groom getsto wear the veil , you think , grateful that this foreignceremony has freed you from the hypocrisyof wearing white . You are relieved that yourparents have opted out of the celebration.The confusion would give your mother aheart attack . And you have always promisedyour father that , since he shelled out thousandsfor your education , when you were ready to getmarried you would elope , paying for the licensefrom your own pocket . A harmonium is playing . You try to walkdown the aisle , but you have had to leave yourshoes outsideplatforms , because in 1975 inIndia they are the latest thingand now youhave four more inches of hemline than youcounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The end of your sariis pinned to your hair . Your head must staycovered , they tell you , out of respect for thebook . You are not entirely unfamiliar with thisconcept of book worship , as your Protestant ancestorsrisked persecution just to read the Bible.But you have never bowed down and thrownpaper money at a book . You are standing next to the man youleft America with five days ago . As his fathertakes off the veil that has protected Deshi 's facefrom envy , you wonder who he is , the son ofthese book worshipers , or the man who paid foryour vodka gimlets between dances and agreedthat a little knowledge is a dangerous thing , that the direct pursuit of pleasure is ultimatelyself-defeating , and that extremism in the pursuitof democracy is still extreme . You standawhile . You sit down . They get you up again.When they want you to move , they push . It'sall so easy . You do n't have to know thelanguage . You walk around the book . At somepoint in the ceremony , Deshi 's mother , whohas n't fainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes your mother-in-law , andthe congregation showers you with rose petals.Hallelujah . Out in the courtyard , where you canput your shoes on again , everybody eats , andyour mother-in-law , who has n't eaten in publicsince you arrived , makes a big show of feedingyou seven spoonfuls of a dessert of carrots andevaporated milk . You suppress a gag . You wonderhow you ever got into the courtyard of thisstucco and gold temple , wrapped up in six yardsof red and gold fabric that hides your feet butleaves your midriff bare . Your mother-in-law haswrapped a veil around her head , and every nowand then she wipes her face with it and muttersto anyone who will listen . You understandonly her eyes . She had to bear the births of allthese daughters before she made a son , and witha man she 'd never seen before they were marriedfor life . She gazes at her son like a lover.He has n't disappointed her a bit . You have . Shelooks at you through a veneer of resignation.Her eyes glow ; her lower lip is barely trembling.And well she might fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between East andWest .
