ELLIS WATCHED THROUGH the rearview mirror as the city shrank to a jumble of angular boxes , lit up against the midnight horizon . Ahead , the highway ran straight through a seemingly endless expanse of shopping malls and reticulated lawns . At last , however , the suburbs began to give way to rolling pasture and woodland ; a long-suppressed nostalgia for the curve of tree and slope welled up in Ellis . He felt like a snake , sloughing layers of stress and grime like husks of faded skin . <p> " We 're off , " he whispered . " Vacation at last . " Katie shifted restlessly in the passenger seat , draped her slim hand across his knee , and muttered in her sleep . The kids did not move . Jason , ten , slumped in the back seat with his fingers resting lightly on his Gameboy . Donna , fifteen , clad in cut-off jeans and that damned Guns ' n ' Roses T-shirt , pillowed her head against her arm . <p> Ellis turned his attention back to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dampen his excitement . God knows , they deserved the holiday . Katie had been working long hours at the catering company and he was exhausted after months as supervising architect for the new mall going up at city center . This year , despite the voluble protest of the kids , Ellis had insisted on something more relaxing than people-chokedbeaches and amusement parks . The camping trip had been his idea . After all , he had n't spent a night beneath the sky since he was Jason 's age , when he had spent a summer at his grandfather 's farm in Ohio . <p> During that memorable summer , Ellis had passed his days swimming and fishing , his nights supine in manure-scented fields , searching out the constellations he had discovered in an old book on his grandfather 's shelves . Ever since , he supposed , he had taken solace in the heavens . He had missed them during the long years in the city . How many times during those years had he peered into a night sky hidden behind a canopy of nacreous city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he topped a hill and discovered a galaxy of blinking lights sprinkled across the valley below . GAS ! blazed a sign from the near end of a vast building . SHOPPING ! glared another from the opposite end , almost lost in the distance . Atop the building , three stories high , ten-foot-tall letters flashed alternately red and yellow against the night sky : REST STOP ! OPEN 24 HOURS ! <p> Ellis glanced at the fuel gauge ; the needle stood at half a tank . He guided the car down the curved exit ramp and parked beneath the pavilion overhanging the fuel islands . Across the moonlit parking lot lay the vast building he had seen from the highway . His headlights glared back at him from a towering glass vestibule . Beside a battery of revolving doors a sign proclaimed in flashing orange neon : The American Mall ! Amusement Park Inside ! The building seemed to shimmer momentarily in the clear air , wavering like a mirage behind ascending ripples of heat . Ellis yawned and turned off the headlights . Maybe some coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What 's wrong , honey ? " she asked . <p> Ellis opened his door and stepped onto the pavement . " Rest stop , " he said . " Better wake the kids . I do n't want to stop again . " <p> Ellis set a pump to fill the car and walked to the edge of the pavilion . He peered up into a hazy wash of gray . The light from the huge complex behind him blotted out the stars . Shaking his head , disgusted , Ellis returned to the gas pump . On the far side of the car , Jason yawned and robbed his eyes with his fists . <p> " Wow ! " he said . " Dad , it says amusement park inside . Can we go in ? " <p> " No way , stupidhead , " said Donna , closing the door beside Ellis . " We 're in a hurry . " And then , as she caught sight of the enormous building at the other end of the parking lot , " Holy shit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes met Katie 's across the car in the unspoken communication natural to them . <p> Raw-boned and dark as her mother , Donna had for years been reserved and studious . In recent months , however , she had started dating seventeen-year-old Eric  --  her first real boyfriend  --  and though she had remained studious she had become . . . well , less reserved . Leave her alone as long as she keeps her grades up , Katie had said , and her eyes flashed the same warning now . <p> " Dad , " said Donna , her voice dreamy . " Can we go in ? " <p> Ellis studied her for a moment . Her eyes had a glassy faraway look . If he had n't known better , he would have sworn she was stoned . <p> " Dad ! " Donna said . <p> Ellis shook his head . It was just the lights reflecting in her eyes , he told himself . He glanced at his watch . " Not tonight , " he said . " It 's after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jason said . <p> The gas pump clicked off . " Come on , " Ellis said . " You can come with me to find the attendant . " <p> The four of them crossed the parking lot . Ellis and Katie dropped back to clasp hands , but the kids ran ahead . <p> " You know , " Katie said . " I know it 's late , but you could give them an hour or so inside . " <p> " Honey , we still have a long drive . " <p> " Well , I know , Ellis , but we 're on vacation . Your vacation , remember . No one 's particularly excited about it but you . " <p> " I thought you wanted to go camping , " he said . <p> " Well , I do n't mind . But the kids are n't too happy . Come on , Ellis , it 's an easy compromise . " <p> Ellis shrugged . " We 'll see . It probably wo n't even be open . " <p> They followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , staring in astonishment at the enormous central gallery that extended before him to the limits of his vision . For a single moment he was so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the place that he could not absorb particulars . Then slowly , details began to seep into his awareness . <p> They stood at the edge of a broad walkway high above a sunken atrium . Far overhead , the ceiling disappeared in a sheen of subdued lighting . Six levels of deserted walkways , connected by escalators , encircled the vast central area . Calliope music reached Ellis , and he realized that below lay the amusement park the sign had promised . Stunned , he stared down at a slowly revolving Ferris wheel . <p> " Holy shit ! " he heard Donna say again , but he could n't bring himself to reprimand her . That was more or less what he was thinking . <p> Polished railings gleamed at him . Stores beckoned from the surrounding walkways . <p> " Daddy , please ! " Jason said . <p> It took a conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and focus on his son . The ten-year-old stood before him , holding his Gameboy loosely in one hand . Ellis stared at the boy as if he did n't quite recognize him : Nikes and Levis , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle T-shirt he had become shy about wearing to school . And in his eyes , the same glassy faraway look Ellis had previously noticed in Donna 's eyes . <p> He was still pondering that when Donna spoke . " Come on , Dad ! Can we please spend an hour or so in civilization since we have to spend the next two weeks out in the woods ? " <p> " Now , listen  --  " Ellis began , but Katie clamped down hard on his hand . He tried again . " Guys , it 's one-thirty in the morning . " <p> " Well , you still have to pay for the gas , " Katie said . <p> " No kidding . Where do you suppose the attendant is ? Outside ? " <p> " I did n't see anyone , " Katie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Dad . " <p> Katie squeezed his hand again and Ellis looked down into her clear eyes . " Listen , " she said . " It is late and we do have to get on the road . But since it 's obviously going to take a while for you to find that attendant , why do n't we look around ? " She glanced at her watch . " It 's one-forty now . Let 's say we meet back here at three . Okay ? " <p> Always the peacemaker , Ellis thought . But what the hell , they were on vacation . And it was going to take a while to find the attendant , he supposed . " Fine , " he said . <p> " Great ! " Jason said . <p> Katie apportioned money to the kids and they disappeared down an escalator , moving toward the amusement park . <p> Ellis turned to his wife . Katie grinned up at him . " Always have to have your way , do n't you ? " he said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall , too ? " <p> " You bet . " <p> " Okay , then . I 'll see you at three . " Katie pecked him on the cheek and then stepped on the escalator to the lower levels . In moments , the vast mall had swallowed her . <p> " Well , " Ellis said . Turning around , he peered out into the night . The car sat alone at the fuel pumps . Ellis could n't see anywhere to pay for the gas out there . Nothing for it but to look in the mall . <p> Ellis turned to his right and moved along the railing that lined the walkway . Carnival sounds  --  calliope music and the seductive cry of barkers , their pitches unintelligible in the distance  --  rose to his ears . He caught a faint whiff of cotton candy . As he walked , trailing one hand along the smooth railing , he studied the stores on his right . They were typical of those he had seen in countless malls  --  an assortment of shoe stores and clothing stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been walking for a while and was on the verge of trying his luck in the other direction when something caught his eye . He was n't really sure what , but it was simultaneously familiar and strange , like the face of a high school acquaintance when encountered years and years later . <p> He paused , searching , glanced out at the walkway opposite , a thin line that blended into the mosaic of stores and signs behind it . Below , and far to his left , the Ferris wheel turned and turned . The scream of a thrill-seeker rose out of the pit , and he caught another saccharine hint of cotton candy in the still air . Cotton candy and something else , something pleasant and long-forgotten . <p> Ellis glanced at his watch and saw that he had been walking for half an hour . A wave of uneasiness began to build within him . Surely the gas attendant would be located closer to the door . That thought served as the catalyst for another , even more enigmatically disturbing . Surely , the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else what was to keep people from filling up and driving away without paying ? People did it all the time , he knew , having worked at a gas station one semester when he was in school . And that thought led to yet a third , like a tiny chain reaction of explosions in his brain : how could a facility this large afford to operate twenty-four hours when almost no one was using it ? <p> The wave of anxiety crested and crashed over him . He turned abruptly to walk back in the direction of the revolving doors and that something familiar caught his eye again . What was it ? <p> Ellis surveyed the nearby shops . He stood before the window of a used bookstore ; a single word in gilt letters had been pasted high against the inner surface of the glass : STARS ! A number of books and magazines were stacked below , astronomy texts and journals mostly , which struck him as a curious choice for a window display . That thought barely registered , however , before it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his elbows on his knees , and stared in disbelief through the glass . <p> He did n't know how long he had been there when the voice spoke : " Can I help you , sir ? " <p> Ellis looked up into the slim pleasant face of a young woman , barely more than a teenager . She was dressed neatly in dark jeans and a lacy white blouse . Staring at her , Ellis could not help but think of Donna in her ragged shorts and black T-shirt . She was every bit as pretty as this young lady . If only she dressed better <p> " Sir ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Ellis said . " It 's just that . . . " <p> " What ? " <p> Ellis stood up . " That book , " he said , indicating a thin book with a faded dustjacket , half-hidden beneath a stack of Sky &; Telescopes . " Can I see that book ? " <p> " Certainly . " <p> Ellis followed the girl inside and watched as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There you go , " she said . She placed it in his hands and moved away to stand behind the counter . <p> Ellis barely noticed . A warm flood of nostalgia suffused him . The Boy 's Book of Constellations , read the title ; below it was a dusty watercolor of a boy and a man looking into the night sky . The man held a book in one hand and pointed at the stars with the other . The stars themselves had been connected with chalky lines to form constellations : the Dippers , Virgo and Aquarius , others . <p> Ellis thumbed through the crumbling pages , stopping at last to study the central illustration : a map of the night sky , with the constellations traced in glowing lines against the darkness . Blackness rose like inky vapor from the pages , encircled his wrists and flowed away to fill the air around him . The bookstore receded slowly , becoming ghostly and faint . Finally , it disappeared altogether , and he found himself in a rolling pasture . A full moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent of cow manure , borne on a summer breeze , washed over him . <p> Inhaling deeply , Ellis sat in the long grass . He plucked a single blade , and chewed it idly as he stared up into the night sky . Stars stood out , bright and unblinking against the darkness . He lay back and it seemed to him that he fell into the sky , as if the earth had been inverted , gravity reversed . He drifted without thought into blackness , into a night place where the constellations stood out with clarity and order . He might have stayed there forever , had not some importunate worry begun to tug at the base of his consciousness . <p> For a while , Ellis tried to ignore it , as he had sometimes tried to disregard the sound of a television in the next room when he was reading a particularly engrossing book . Concentrating with all his might on the stars that stood out against the darkness above him , he almost succeeded . It was that knowledge , that awareness of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent tug of worry . <p> What ? he thought . What was it ? <p> And then : Katie . The kids . <p> Suddenly , the stars drew away to glimmering points . The field tore apart , shredding into dark rags that blew to the corners of his vision and disappeared . He stood in the bookstore , a grassy taste lingering on his tongue . For a single moment , Ellis thought he detected the scent of cow manure , half-familiar and weighted with all his memories of that long-ago summer . And then it too was gone , supplanted by the cloying odor of cotton candy . Ellis looked down at his hands , clenched white about The Boy 's Book of Constellations . <p> " Sir ? " the girl said . " Are you all right sir ? " <p> " I  --  I have to meet my family , " Ellis said . He forced his fingers to relax and shoved the book under his right arm . He glanced at his watch . Two forty-five . " I 'd like this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter and reached for his wallet . <p> " Oh no , sir . Take it . It 's yours . Your money 's no good here . " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " Your money , " she said . " It 's no good here . The book is yours . The night manager has seen to that . " <p> " The night manager ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " I see , " Ellis said , but he did n't , not at all . He picked up the book and hesitated briefly . " You do n't happen to know where I pay for gas in this place , do you ? " <p> The girl gave him a puzzled smile . " Your money 's no good here , sir , " she repeated . <p> Ellis nodded . " I see . Well , I need to go . My family 's waiting . " <p> The girl did n't reply . Ellis left the store and walked rapidly in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , would be waiting  --  Katie smiling because he had n't made it back by three , the kids tired and grumpy . <p> But when he reached the doors at ten minutes after three , no one was there . Puzzled , Ellis went to the edge of the walkway and stared into the depths . From this angle , looking down beyond a lattice of walkways and escalators , with the Ferris wheel spinning below him , the mall seemed as void of stable perspective as an Escher print . Ellis felt as if he was staring into a kaleidoscope . Impossible angles converged in an endlessly replicating network of images that was somehow hideous . Sour bile rose in his mouth . With one hand , he clutched The Boy 's Book of Constellations  --  <p>  --  Open it !  --  <p>  --  and shut his eyes . The music of the calliope built to a frenzy and swept him up in its jaunty rhythm . Against the dark screens of his eyelids , Ellis saw projected that whirling paradox of images , a crazy melange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar vista of the city as he had seen it through the rearview mirror : a hodgepodge of garish boxes , drowning out the stars . <p> Once , when Ellis had been in school , a professor had commented , " Nature hates a straight line . " That statement returned to him now , in company with an arresting vision : a world with nothing but straight lines , a grid of streets that went on forever . Nostalgia for the curve of tree and slope surprised him again . A fleeting image of his grandfather 's rolling pasture , the stars above , passed before him , and unbidden the thought came to him : the book . Open it . <p> He turned his back to the pit and opened his eyes . He held The Boy 's Book of Constellations in trembling hands . Open it ! part of him cried . Open it and be done with this ! No , Ellis thought . That was too easy . What the hell was happening here ? Where were Katie and the kids ? <p> Steeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty escalators and walkways intersected at wholly prosaic angles . The Ferris wheel revolved lethargically . <p> " Katie ! " he screamed . " Jason ! Donna ! " <p> The mocking strains of the calliope drifted up to enfold him  --  that and his own voice , crying ghostly out of the distance . They 're late , he thought , that 's all . They 're probably on their way right now . But even so , a hundred tenuous filaments of panic began to work through his body . <p> What if they were n't ? <p> " Katie ! " he yelled , and a rational core at the center of his mind wondered at the hysterical edge to his voice . What 's wrong , Ellis ? it asked . Something bothering you ? And something sure as hell was , he knew . Something about this mall and this long strange night . Something about The Boy 's Book of Constellations . " Donna ! Jason ! " <p> From behind Ellis , a mellifluous voice said , " It really is no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " and panic  --  fear  --  came on like a light within him . Each one of those tiny filaments glared suddenly incandescent with hysteria . Out of the distance , his own cry returned to him , dissolving in the frenetic cadence of the calliope . <p> " Ellis , " that voice said . " Why do n't you turn around ? " <p> Ellis opened his mouth to speak , but his throat had gone dry . Blood roared in his ears . Finally , his voice a sandpapery rasp , he said , " Who are you ? " <p> The voice said , " I 'm the night manager , Ellis . I think you knew that . Really , I do n't see any point in talking to your back . Why do n't you turn around ? " <p> Ellis did . The night manager stood quietly before the revolving doors . He was angular and tall  --  too tall , some part of Ellis 's mind insisted  --  dressed impeccably in a gray double-breasted suit with a pink vanity handkerchief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He clutched the book  --  <p>  --  Open it !  --  <p>  --  against his chest and began to back away , skating his hand along the rail . <p> " Ellis ! " said the night manager . " Stop ! " <p> Ellis stopped . Moving with the predatory grace and strength of a shark , the night manager glided across the space between them . He stooped and peered into Ellis 's face , his black vertiginous eyes dissolving first into a wheeling panorama of constellations , and then into the kaleidoscope of images Ellis had seen before : escalators and walkways that met at impossible angles ; the city , tawdry against the midnight sky . The night manager raised his bony finger and leaned even closer . His breath stank of cotton candy . <p> " Look , " he hissed , and jabbed his long finger out over the rail . When he spoke again , his tone was reverent  --  the tone of voice a man uses when he encounters some awe-inspiring natural wonder . " Look at it . Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the pit , following the line of the bony finger . The great mall lay spread out all before him , a vast well of light and sound and whirling movement that stretched to the distant horizon . <p> " Five-point-two-million square feet of retail space , " said the night manager . " A seven-acre amusement park . I thought it might appeal to a man of your talents , a man of your profession . " He moved closer , his long arm encircling Ellis 's shoulders . His pale thin fingers enclosed Ellis 's upper arm . <p> In his left hand , pressed close against him by the night manager 's wiry body , Ellis held The Boy 's Book of Constellations . When he spoke , his voice was tight with panic . " Where are my wife and children ? " <p> " In the mall , Ellis , " the night manager said . " Where else ? " <p> Ellis struggled against the other man 's grip , but the fingers about his upper arm merely tightened . The night manager swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis felt his back arch painfully , his feet come away from the floor , and then he was dangling out into space , the noise of the calliope rising around him . <p> " Listen , my friend , " the night manager said . " Let 's have some cooperation . " <p> Ellis swallowed , and struggled to squeeze words past the huge lump that had formed in his throat . " Okay , " he gasped . <p> Ellis felt himself pulled back across the rail . His feet touched the floor and he found himself staring into the night manager 's fury-contorted face . His eyes were black pits . His lips pulled back in a savage grimace . <p> " Your family is quite content , I assure you . Jason is infatuated with the amusement park . And Donna . Well , she lives for the mail . She hardly took any convincing at all . " <p> " And Katie ? " Ellis asked . His voice dwindled to a hoarse whisper . The night manager chuckled . " Ahh , Katie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a restaurant of her very own . There 's always room for another merchant at the American Mall , Ellis . You , my friend , you 're the only problem that remains . " <p> Ellis 's fingers tightened reflexively about the book and that interior voice piped up again : Open it ! It 's  --  <p> "  --  the only way , " said the night manager . Grinning , he released Ellis 's arms and stepped back . " In there , I wo n't disturb you . Nothing will . Just open it up , and I 'll go away . " <p> And then Ellis had the book open in his hands . Its pages seemed to whip by of their own accord , settling at last on the dark map at its center . Black coils rose up to embrace him , encircled his wrists like manacles , and flooded the mall with darkness . Ellis concentrated on the night manager 's vulpine grin , but finally it disappeared , occluded by the encroaching blackness . He stood alone in his grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ellis reclined on the hillside . His fingers twined in long grass , plucked a single blade , and brought it to his lips . Above him , the stars wheeled by . For a long moment , he fought to remember : a gaunt figure that moved with predatory grace ; a vast enclosed space , where escalators and walkways converged at impossible angles ; Katie and the children , somehow lost . But it was too much , too much for him to hold . He had fallen into the night sky , with only the grassy pasture beneath him , and it was all too distant . <p> A breeze washed across his flesh , bearing the pleasant scent of cow-manure , baked dry beneath a summer sun . That scent and something else , something sweet and not altogether pleasant . What was it ? <p> The stars grew distant as Ellis concentrated , filtering out the heavy odor of manure to focus on the scent which lay beneath . Finally he had it : the midway smell of cotton candy . And with that scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded through his mind : the city , upright against the dark sky ; the vast rest stop spread out across the valley ; the night manager 's fury-twisted features as he said , " Your family is quite content , I assure you . " <p> This ? He was to give up everything for this , a boyhood night on his grandfather 's farm ? <p> The pasture came apart around him , black rags blowing to the edge of his vision and disappearing . He stood in the mall , the night manager before him . <p> " What is t his place ? " Ellis asked . His voice was the barest panic-stricken croak . <p> " Do n't you know ? " said the night manager . " Have n't you the least idea ? And you 've done so much to create it , you with your designs for fancy malls and fine new shopping centers . It 's good work if you can get it , is n't it , Ellis ? " <p> " No , " said Ellis . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But you have ! " The night manager threw back his head , threw out his arms as if to encompass everything . When he spoke again , his voice was filled with an almost religious wonder . " Feel it , Ellis , " he whispered , " feel it . " <p> And Ellis did . A vast aching hunger seemed to sweep across the continent , to sweep him up in the currents of some voiceless all-consuming desire . <p> " What is it ? " he said . " What is it ? " <p> " Their hunger . " The night manager leaned close into Ellis 's face , his maniacal eyes seeming almost to glow . " Out of their ceaseless desire , this  --  " he gestured wildly at the surrounding mall , " this was born . I roam the night highways , Ellis . I feed on your desires . " <p> " No , " Ellis said . His voice was calm now , and very cold . He looked away , looked down at the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his grandfather 's farm suddenly returned to him . " You ca n't have my dream , " he said . " It belongs to me . " <p> Ellis turned and cast The Boy 's Book of Constellations far out into the pit . It tumbled as it fell , its dustjacket blowing loose and away , its pages riffling in the still air . It disappeared into the smear of light and color that was the amusement park . The music of the calliope shrieked to a climax and fell still . Ellis spun to face the night manager , but the other figure , tall and elongated as a praying mantis , had begun to shimmer and grow insubstantial . <p> " No ! " Ellis screamed . " My family ! " <p> The mall wavered like the image on a television with bad reception , breaking up , colors bleeding into long streaks . Even as Ellis watched , it began to fragment into long wisps and coils , so much fog before a heavy wind . <p> " My family ! " Ellis screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if in answer to his cry , Ellis saw them , one by one , framed by the night manager 's translucent form : Jason , alone atop the furiously spinning Ferris wheel , his eyes wide with hysterical joy ; Donna , turning and turning in some private dance , with a partner only she could perceive ; Katie last of all . She stood in a vast gleaming kitchen that seemed to go on forever . It was empty . Empty as far as Ellis could see . <p> " Katie ! " he cried . " Katie ! " <p> She looked up , horrific awareness dawning in her eyes . Then she was obscured by a veil of shifting colors . <p> The night manager 's thin face split into a mocking grin . In the moment before he was tom into a hundred wispy fragments and blown away , he reached out and caressed Ellis 's cheek with his long bony fingers . Finally only his voice lingered , distant and tiny , as over a bad telephone connection in the dead of night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " too late . " <p> And then he was gone entirely . Everything was gone . <p> Ellis stood alone by the car , with the rusty gas pumps beside him . Nothing else remained . All about him , the lone and level parking lot stretched away . A stiff wind came up , chasing litter across the moonlit pavement , and a rectangle of heavy paper flattened itself against the side of the car . It rustled when Ellis peeled it away . The Boy 's Book of Constellations , he read . <p> " Goddamn you ! " he cried into the night . And then , " Donna ! Jason ! Katie ! " <p> He fell silent , and in the silence he heard ' Katie 's faraway voice , fraught with the promise of tears , saying " Ellis ? Ellis ? " <p> Agreat knot seemed to form in Ellis 's throat . He scanned the parking lot , hardly daring to hope , and at last he saw her . A small pale figure , distant in the moonlight , she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must have seen him simultaneously , for suddenly they were both running They came together and Ellis swung her into his embrace . <p> At last , Katie said , " Oh , Ellis , I heard you . At the last minute , I heard you , and I understood . " <p> " I know , " he said . <p> They walked across the abandoned lot , back to the car . <p> " What about the kids ? " Katie asked . " What about Donna and Jason ? " " I do n't know , " Ellis said . But those images remained : Jason , joyous atop the whirling Ferris wheel ; Donna , turning in her private dance . Lost . Forever lost . <p> I roam the night highways , the night manager had said , and now Ellis repeated those words to himself like a mantra , forcing himself to believe . Maybe it was n't too late , he thought . Maybe , somehow , along some lonely midnight interstate , they would find this place again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it took . <p> <p> By Dale Bailey <p> Dale Bailey 's story , " Giants in the Earth .
