ContentsII III # I <p> " ALL I EVER DID was almost invent nylon , " I was saying to somebody at one of the wakes . I was drunk , of course . " But sheesh . These guys . Shamus figured how to get the seven dwarves to go to work . And Ray , he kept us warm , gave us those little coffee cups you can take a bite out of , and saved us from drowning . And they got the girls too . " I do n't know where that last part came from , not exactly . It was killing me to have to bury them , a week apart . I might have been a little out of my mind . <p> We met for the first time just last year , in an emergency room in Cambria , California . My kid and their grandkids were sick . We were all spending the summer there with our families , or parts of them , and we got to talking . Ray 's granddaughter had an ear infection . Shamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the wild one , Kevin . My little girl , not so little , really  --  we did n't know what the matter was then . Our kids were hurt , and so we met . Can you beat that ? Three old guys , tired of the beach and the sun . Just minding our own business . It was the summer of 1994 . We were all at least fifty years past our best work . <p> Shamus was looking at a copy of Gray 's Anatomy . <p> " The leg bone connected to the hip bone , " he was saying quiet-like to himself and Kevin . Kevin was greenish with pain , the color of the Pacific on a cloudy day , which there had been only a few of the whole month of June . <p> " How 'd he do that ? " Ray asked , gritting his teeth , his head trembling of its own accord the way it did sometimes . <p> " Bike , " Shamus said . " Meeting of bike , boy , and seawall . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heigh-ho , " Kevin said without opening his eyes . <p> " Not a friendly meeting , " I said . <p> Shamus smiled and went on sketching with a pencil in the margin of the anatomy book . <p> " Shamus Culhane , " he said and glanced up , nodding at Ray , at me . He held our eyes a moment to see if we recognized the name . " Sorry to meet you under these circumstances . " <p> " Ray McIntire , " Ray said . <p> " My dad 's name is Lewellen , " my little Patricia said . She would do this whenever she had the chance , make this preemptive strike . She told me when she was much younger that I had a name kids made fun of , so it was better to get introductions out of the way quick . She really had it , that sensitive nature you watch lying heavy upon dying kids in the movies . It makes me furious to see them now , made a spectacle , a cliche , but Patty really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and then went for the gracious lie . " Wish we were all back out on the beach . " We looked at our sick kids , nodded . <p> We did n't know who we were , then . I like to say it that way because it 's more true . We were men into old age , two of us a year before death , responsible for teenaged children , and we had no idea who we were . I think of that afternoon now , and I wonder if Shamus was drawing Dopey and Doc for the millionth time , if Ray was imagining some unholy marriage of dry ice and Styrofoam . I myself was thinking about nylon . As usual . Pantyhose . <p> I did n't know where my wife was , not exactly . My second wife . I had n't known for some time , thirteen months . I could still see her legs , the backs of them , walking away from me , down the steps of our old house in Newark , the left leg with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Achilles tendon , her still-slim ankle disappearing into the car . She was too young for me , really , forty . She had just said , " When will you ever get over this , Lew ? Why ca n't you just forget ? It 's been more than sixty years . " We wanted to hit each other , and then she went out and got in the car . I can imagine her foot 's stamp on the accelerator . I know how the ankle bone and the surrounding muscles allow the foot to perform that action . Like the punch that waits inside your fist , but less so . I did n't need any illustrated text showing me how women walked . Sometimes I got myself to believe that shimmer , flex , hop was actually my gift to womankind . <p> And then there was Patty coming apart at the seams , and me running around trying to put her back together , my hands full of her hair , fingers , teeth . That was in dreams , working to piece her together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How to put that back ? And her tiny still voice whispering , No , Daddy , that 's your heart . You keep it . No , no . Someday you 'll need it . Yes , you will . <p> That day on the central coast was the beginning of something I 'm only just now starting to understand . The world has just given up those two : Shamus Culhane , pioneer animator for Disney and other studios , and Ray McIntire , inventor of Styrofoam . I wo n't outlive them by much , I feel sure . And the world has also just lost Julian Hill , the inventor of nylon , my old lab partner at Du Pont , who at precisely the wrong moment said , " No , here Lew , I 'll do it . " Then he introduced a thin , heated surface , a glass rod , into a polymer . We expected a shiny , hard material , but instead he got that famous elastic , named for New York City  --  Nylon , hoopla , celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , it seems like that moment was always coming at me . Just like it does n't surprise me that Shamus and Ray and the kids and I should have met and for a little while had our lives mixed up together . It 's destiny . It 's grace , that beautiful , electric kiss . There 's a part of the human anatomy that has it for a name , grace : the most superficial muscle on the inner thigh , thin and fiat , broad above and tapering below like an exclamation point of flesh . You can forget that this grace muscle , gracilis , is there until somebody runs a cool finger along it . <p> " Nothing worse than a sick kid , " I said then , back in the waiting room in Cambria . I was just making conversation . Nobody was asking about Patty because you could see the problem was something unspeakable . Shamus was over there , across the sea of false cheer in that waiting room , maybe reading in Gray 's Anatomy about what we would all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but did n't  --  filling the shafts of the long bones and extending into the canals that contain the blood vessels ; how normal marrow cells look like the olives in your martini . <p> " In the summer , especially , " Shamus said , and rubbed the tip of his index finger lightly on the back of Kevin 's hand . It was a gesture unbelievably acute in its tenderness . Ray watched , and then his shoulders contracted inward , a kind of wince , the scapula shoveling forward to protect the tender heart . <p> " Great weather we 've had , " Ray said . " Good for swimming . " <p> " Nice for them , especially , " I said , nodding at the kids . <p> " Not really a kid town , though , is it ? " Shamus said . " Kind of too quiet . " <p> We agreed the place appeared to be a sleepy secret , a dream . Shamus said he 'd just come up from Los Angeles , and this sure was n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " What you 're doing here is your own business . Even in a motel with thin walls . Privacy . " He laughed . " I sound like I 'm doing some shady deal , do n't I ? " He shook his head . " It was supposed to be a nice vacation for my grandson . And look at him . " <p> " You renting here ? " Ray said , nodding at both of us . We said yes , long-term at the Best Western , the Blue Dolphin , good to be out of Manhattan for Shamus , out of Delaware for me , Michigan for Ray . He and his wife had a little apartment . We were all just down the street from each other , on Moonstone Beach . Somehow that was a relief . I could feel it , there in the room , a relaxation of tensed muscles , a slowing of hearts that had been clacking away ever since we came in the door . I think , at our age , you 're drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it 's that simple . We smiled and looked at our kids , all of whom had their heads back against the mint-colored walls and their eyes closed . Patty and Ellie McIntire were actually snoring . A thin line of drool ran out of Ellie 's mouth . Ray reached over to wipe her chin . <p> " Tylenol and a big margarita , " he said , meaning the sleeping potion he 'd concocted for Ellie . We waited a second to be appalled , for the police , or child protective services , to walk in right then . We laughed . Shamus shot his eyes left and right , then leaned forward . <p> " How about we make a deal ? " he said . " First one through here has the other two in for drinks . " It was three in the afternoon . " Nothing fancy . " <p> " Unless there 's an emergency , " I said . <p> " Of course , " Shamus said . Once again we all looked at Patty . Do I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A rhythmic scratching , ghostly ? I remember that we were all deeply tanned . It was the end of June , and for four weeks the weather had been perfect , not too hot in the afternoons . Women on the beach were practically drunk with coconut oil and Coppertone , and with the color of their own skin . You would see them glance at themselves in store mirrors , car mirrors , the corner chrome on the freezer case in the ice-cream parlor . And it seemed the darker they got , the more impermeable they became , all those deeper tissues the skin protects growing safer and safer . All of us , I thought , in our darkening fortresses . <p> Ray got through first . Ellie 's ear infection was obvious to treat-swabbing , a dose of penicillin . The doctor also removed a tiny pebble from her ear canal . <p> " Her ears are beautiful , " Ray called to us on his way out . " So we 'll see you when we see you . " He gave us his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff in there , though , " Shamus said . He looked at Ellie . " That 's what drawers and closets are for , honey . " <p> Ray stopped with his hand on the doorknob . " Have you ever seen the inside of an ear ? I got to look , just now . God , it 's beautiful . There 's this little triangle of light that sits at the bottom of the whatever it is . " <p> " Tympanic membrane , " Shamus said , raising Gray 's to show us the source of his knowledge . <p> Patty and Kevin took longer to finish up . The break in Kevin 's leg was monstrous . The breaks , I should say . A transverse fracture of the patella and both the tibia and fibula , and an odd dislocation of the ankle . Shamus later told us the doctor said Kevin 's leg looked like it had been through a mangle . He studied Shamus for a long time . " But it was a bike accident . Is that right ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have arrived at full-throttle manhood at that precise moment , told the doctor to stop thinking like a suspicious jerk and get on with it . Shamus said when they left , he glanced back to look for Kevin 's childhood kicked away into a corner of the examination room  --  so he could maybe retrieve it  --  but it was gone for good . <p> Patty had a fever and a cough that would n't go away . She was impossibly tired , rundown . The examining physician asked questions about where we were from , how long we were staying  --  pleasantries , I thought . Then he asked me to go out to the waiting room . I did n't like that much , but Patty said it was OK , so I went . Gray 's Anatomy was on the low table where Shamus had left it , along with a white tennis sweater . I picked up the book , took a quick look at the female organs of generation , as Dr. Henry Gray would have it , then the brain . I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobes : frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital . Not so much the drawings themselves as the colors he assigns them , those grade-school geography-book map colors : sky-blue , buttery yellow , a green like sage , and the pink that 's the peculiar shade of pencil erasers . Not the primary colors , but something far more elemental . Colors that will make you panicky for the rest of your life . <p> So when the examining physician came back out , I was already shaken . He wanted to run more tests . He wanted to know where Patty 's mother was . I saw it happening all over again , her back out the door , her left leg folding itself into the car , the way she said , " I ca n't take this anymore , " and made her arms swoop to mean all of it , all of our life . I wanted to reach for Gray 's to explain it to him  --  all that ridiculous Latin : fibula , tibia , dorsalis pedis artery , soleus flapping under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendo achillus , the thickest , strongest tendon in the body . There were illustrations . This is how she walked out , I would say . Look , I can explain everything . It was all very scientific . But even in science , the unexpected could happen . You might be asked to step aside . You 'd tense up for brittleness , a crack like a hand across your cheek , and all of a sudden the substance would get like taffy , stretch and pull , evanesce , liquefy . You 'd stand there watching , your fists in your pockets . You 'd stand there maybe all night , staring at the blue glow from the burner . <p> At Ray 's later that afternoon and into the evening , we drank a lot of gin , always with lime , mostly with tonic . We met Elizabeth , Ray 's wife , who is blind . We met the college student from Washington , DC , who was housesitting next door , whom everyone later came to hope I would fall for , even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dreamy , besotted coincidence that summer became , was Shayla Gray . We discovered , grandmother and father and grandfathers and Shayla Gray alike , that we had come to Cambria with one suitcase and one child , though all of us-except Shayla  --  had at least two children or grandchildren . The others were off at camp or visiting friends , and we missed them , truly we did , but what we confessed to each other that evening as the sun fell headlong into the Pacific was that the child we 'd brought with us was the favorite . <p> " You 're kidding , " Shayla said . " You ca n't have a favorite . It 's not allowed . " God , she was young and beautiful and demanding . <p> " Yes , it 's true , " we told her , glancing wildly around to see if the other children might have crept into town , into the room , at just that unfortunate instant . <p> " And look , " Shayla went on . " They 're all sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all just broken and infected and  --  " She looked at me . " What 's wrong with Patty , did you say ? " <p> " Exhaustion , " I said . <p> " It 's hard work being the favorite , is n't it ? " Shamus said . " Jesus Christ . " <p> After that , I think I recall the women going into the kitchen to make clam chowder or clam sauce for spaghetti : I do n't quite remember . I do n't even know if I ate it . By that time , we knew who we were . Shamus and Ray talked about royalties and patents and investments , and I told the story of Julian Hill and the invention of nylon . We were talking in the dark , which I mean in every possible way . We were all looking that summer for something to carry us blazing into the future . Shamus was writing his memoirs . He was also fascinated by human anatomy . He thought there was something happening in the motion-picture industry , some fond alliance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies , a discovery that would relieve the world of stuntmen forever . He knew a few who 'd been hurt , paralyzed , one who 'd died . Ray was experimenting with insulation , dreaming up problems and solving them , casting off old ideas with the no , no , no of his shaking head . I was mulling over the sheerest , strongest nylon stocking possible . We were at the edge of ourselves then , at the edge of the world , and the sun was falling over it . It was dark , and our favorite children were sick , and the women had abandoned us . <p> What we did next was very strange . We got up and walked out onto the porch , down the back stairs , and over to Shayla Gray 's house  --  not her house , of course , but her uncle 's . We let ourselves in the kitchen door . We snooped around the place , which was immense : five bedrooms , three-and-a-half baths , living room , dining room , kitchen , screened porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or peek into closets . We simply took stock , like prospective buyers . Then we went back to Ray 's apartment , the downstairs bedroom , hauled our sleeping children awake and took them to Shayla Gray 's uncle 's house , installed them in two of the five bedrooms , Kevin in one , Ellie and Patty in the other , though naturally they got up right away to look around . We brought the gin with us . And then Ray called Elizabeth and Shayla and told them where we were . <p> It was all my idea . I can say that now , though I still have no clue why . Years ago , I might have said it had something to do with Julian Hill getting credit for the invention , when the truth is I was standing right there holding the glass rod . I wanted to say that sentence : It was all my idea . I loved Julian , though , I really did . I loved it when  --  later , in his retirement speech  --  he said he was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew he was talking about that moment in the lab . He was lucky . <p> The women came over . " I do n't understand this , " Elizabeth said . <p> " Ask him , " Ray told her . " Ask Lew . " <p> " We 're occupying these premises , " I said . " Shayla , my dear , we 're moving in . We all have one suitcase and one sick child , and you have this big house . " That 's as far as I got . <p> " The kids are lonely , " Ray suggested . " We 'll help with the rent . " <p> " I 'm not paying rent , " Shayla said . <p> " Great , " I said . " Better . Perfect . " <p> Shayla touched Elizabeth 's arm . " What do you think ? " she said . <p> " Well , " said Elizabeth , " maybe we should eat first . We can eat here . Is anybody even hungry ? " We allowed that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two women went back to Ray and Elizabeth 's apartment . We could see them through the kitchen window , talking . Shayla was lifting the big pot off the stove . Then Elizabeth picked up the phone , and it rang in Shayla 's house . <p> " It 's for me , " Ray said . He lifted the receiver . " Hi , Liz . OK . I 'll ask her . " He called over his shoulder , " Ellie , Grandma wants to know if you need to be in your own bed . " <p> " Not really , " Ellie said . <p> " She says no . She says it 's not her bed anyway . It 's some rental bed full of rental sand . " <p> We could see Elizabeth shake her head in the kitchen next door . She hung up , then tucked a loaf of French bread under her arm and let Shayla lead her back to us . At the house , Shayla got out some bowls , white like moons . She found a shaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it , and the kids broke up laughing . It was good to hear . <p> We ate without saying much . By this time it was ten-thirty . Then Shayla assigned rooms . <p> " I 'll sleep on the couch , " I said when it was my turn . " Somebody might need something . Something might happen . " <p> " All right . " She looked at me , I like to think wondering about the possibilities , about my old bones , wondering what they might still be capable of . One of the hardest structures of the animal body , bones-tough and elastic both , thin plates of tissue circling central canals that look like the eyes of owls . And all you had left at the bitter end . <p> II In the beginning , Betty Boop was a kind of puppy dog , Shamus told us the next evening . We were all sitting in the living room , eight of us . Dogs got to be his specialty , in a way . Pluto , for example . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smart enough , but not too smart . And a real Romeo . " <p> " Why 'd you call him Pluto ? " Ray said . <p> " Because he 's out there ? " Shayla Gray suggested . " I mean , jeez , his master 's named Goofy . " <p> " Is Goofy Pluto 's master ? " Elizabeth wanted to know . <p> " Pluto was always his own master , " Shamus said . <p> " What do you think about all those new Disneys  --  Aladdin , Pocahontas , that whole crew ? " I said . " Do you think of them as , I do n't know , pretenders ? " <p> " Sort of . They 're so pretty . Well-dressed . " <p> " Well , Shamus , remember Goofy . How come you dressed him that way ? " I said . <p> " Goofy was n't my doing , " Shamus said . " Krazy Kat , Popeye , Woody Woodpecker , I did all those guys , at various times . The fringe personalities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shayla said , " but it seems a funny thing to want to do . Animate . Like I always wondered why guys who make mobiles do that . How do you explain it in your book ? " <p> " I ca n't , " Shamus said . " I never could . " <p> Shamus looked at Shayla , and his eyes seemed to move farther back in his skull . It was an odd effect  --  it seemed like an effect rather than a physical possibility . It occurred to me then how large and still and full this room was in Shayla Gray 's uncle 's house . And how strange a thing it was that we had done . I could n't at that moment even remember why it had been so imperative to me that we change houses , move in together . Or why everyone else had agreed . There were eight of us in various stages of sickness , tenuous health , and the cocktail hour . Everyone had slept well  --  even me , on the couch , half-waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all had woken early and stayed inside most of the day . Shayla had a part-time job at the Cambria paper , and so she went into town to work and brought back a few groceries . Now she was in the kitchen , cutting up beef for a stew . She was wearing a tank top with thin straps , cut low in front and behind . I liked the way the muscles of her arms and back worked as she sawed the knife into the meat  --  tricep , deltoid , trapezius . Gray 's anatomy ; Jesus , it took me long enough to think of that one . I wondered if there was any relation . <p> " Maybe it 's like acting , only it is n't you ? " Shayla said . <p> " Exactly , " Shamus said . <p> He got his start , it seems , when a veteran animator showed up drunk to work . Shamus covered for him in the production of an odd little scene , a monkey with a hot towel . <p> " A stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel . You know . Like a Turkish towel . " <p> " A monkey ? " <p> Behind us , the children were laughing . Kevin had rolled his shoulders forward so that his arms dragged low to the ground . Then he was batting a napkin in the air as if it were too hot to touch . For a moment we all watched him . He was almost seventeen that year , and his body was just coming into its real power . He was n't wearing a shirt  --  it seems like he never did the whole month we stayed in that house . Partly it was the extraordinary heat , but also Kevin 's fascination with the man he was turning into . He did n't move much , but when he got up to go to the bathroom or to his room and passed the mirrors in the hall and then on the bathroom door , he looked . He usually found some excuse to stop , to rest , to try to get at an itch down inside his cast . It thrilled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at his own face . And he was a good-looking young man . But he seemed much more interested in the cut of his shoulders and chest , all of it named in the book that came with us and sat on the coffee table : pectorals , biceps , triceps , the obliques , the transversals . He watched himself move in these small , limited ways , eagerly tracking the spread and gather of all that fibrous tissue lying secretly under the skin . When I go to the gym these days , I see other young men  --  though older than Kevin  --  peering at themselves in the mirror in just the same way . It interests me that the women do n't do this . The few women who work with weights in that part of the gym almost never look in the mirror . If their reflection suddenly surprises them , they drop their gaze . Patty and Ellie never inspected themselves publicly , not that I saw . <p> Shayla Gray did n't admire herself much either . Though she ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : no matter how little she wore out on the beach alone , if any of us joined her , or when she came up to the house , she put on a T-shirt and shorts . I have made her into a kind of vision here , I know  --  a strange , passive presence , a woman who would let the rickety circus of us take over her house , her solitude . So to make her active , imagine a woman of medium height with light-brown hair and blue eyes  --  shockingly , piercingly blue in the depths of her face . She was intensely muscular , from running , it seemed , which she did every morning without fail and for a long time , over an hour . And she was tanned , of course , as we all were , but I have never seen such thoroughly freckled skin  --  small , soft-brown freckles and larger black ones , moles I guess , but somehow oddly attractive , not at all witchlike or contagious-looking . I should say here that though I admire women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It often seems a death-defying act to touch them . It 's hardly surprising then that I should have only nearly invented nylon , and justice that I did n't get any credit for it . <p> For some time , four days , we did n't leave the house except to walk across the street to the beach . We did n't speak much either , until evening , when we convened for cocktails and sunset on the front porch . We moved about the house , I think , like dancers  --  good dancers , who know there must be a sacred space preserved between their bodies . And that if they do touch , it must be lightly , with grace , and full of longing . No one seemed to know that better than Patty . As I sat reading , she would drift up behind the chair , lean down , and lay her cheek on my shoulder , though only for a moment . Then she would come around and sit on the footstool in front of me . <p> " Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked more than once . " It 's reference . " <p> " For the pictures , " I said . I had taken to Shamus 's copy of Gray 's Anatomy like it was a thriller , a real page-turner . I was stunned by what I never knew about the body , and by what was known 140 years ago , how much . It did in fact seem like a mystery novel , and at the end , if I understood the human body , I 'd finally have the truth about the heart , its troubles , about who did what to whom . <p> " You should get out and get some fresh air , " Patty said . " See what 's going on . " She gave me a kiss and drifted away . <p> Our news of the world came from Shayla . She went into town to The Cambrian and the post office . She also worked for the Motion Picture Association of America , in what seemed to us a very unusual capacity . Every few days , she would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Spain . Her job was to translate the movie titles and blurbs for anything that appeared to be an American movie . Often European television ran American movies without paying the fees , and Shayla Gray 's job was to compile a list of who had shown what when and to send it to the MPAA . <p> " Translation is weird , " she said . " And sometimes European TV producers are tricky . They like to yank our chains a little . For years , The Graduate ran on Swedish television as The Dropout . The French , too : Gone with the Wind ran as Plus Jamais Faire  --  roughly , Never Hungry Again . Sometimes all you have to go on is the name of an actor , but they do n't usually list them unless it 's somebody way famous . " <p> So , she said , it made her one of those people you liked to be standing next to in the video store when you 're saying to your date , What 's that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even look at you when she says 9 1/2 Weeks . <p> " The French love that guy , " Shayla told me . " I do n't get it . He always seems like he 's just ordered a pizza . That lazy , hungry , **68;912;TOOLONG look . " <p> OK , I was . I was falling for Shayla Gray . It was her uncle 's house , too , and the Pacific Ocean out in front of us all day long , whispering , The sun 's setting on you , Lew . There was a kind of momentum at work . Something dragging all of us out of the bedrooms to stand alone and look at the horizon , and then sending us back into each other 's company at night . <p> " So is n't there anyone waiting for you back home ? " I said to her one day , about the end of the first week . <p> She shook her head no in that way women can do it , where they shake their heads and roll their eyes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man : the recti muscles in a man 's eye can not operate in tandem with the sternomastoid muscle . I do not know why this is . Dr. Gray is mute on the subject . <p> " So why did you come to California ? " <p> Shayla glanced around the room  --  to see , I presumed , whether there were children present . " I heard you could get laid here , " she said . Then she laughed . " Not really . D.C. is a swamp in the summer . It was the free house . You know , there 's no such thing as a free house . " <p> " You could n't say no . " <p> " I could n't say no . " She looked past me , out the window , then back . " So where 's Patty 's mother ? " <p> " She left about a year ago . " For a moment we watched Ray lead Elizabeth up the path to the road . They waited to cross . " I 'm hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're all hard to live with . " <p> " No . I 've been hard to live with since the 1930s . " <p> " Since Julian Hill and his polymers ? " <p> " So you heard ? " I said . <p> " Elizabeth told me . " <p> " You just ca n't imagine . " <p> " Sure I can , " Shayla said . " I 'm a woman . Of course I can imagine what it 's like to be standing right there and not get any credit . " <p> Ray and Elizabeth stopped trying to cross the street . They turned back toward the ocean , and I knew at once someone had called out to them  --  or up to them , rather , from the beach . It always stuns me how you can get the most profound information just from how far the head turns . I resisted the impulse to consult Gray 's about it . And sure enough , the children came scrambling over the rise , Kevin limping without his crutches  --  he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull Patty with him . Ellie followed a ways behind . Kevin and Patty had in five days become devoted friends . Just to look at them , you could see how the one needed the other : Kevin 's bullish , hardening body needed the china shop of Patty . Her frailty made him more careful , and his energy seemed to make her less tired . They had embarked together on the project of getting rid of Patty 's cough , trying every remedy they could think of : honey , salt , steam , lemon , boiled water from the Pacific . <p> And Ellie did not want them . Ray joked that Ellie 's ear infection had left her a little bit deaf , and it was true . Much of the time , she seemed not to hear us when we spoke . Sometimes she appeared to be counting . Her lips moved , and her chin rose and fell just slightly , almost imperceptibly , the way it looks when you 're working with numbers , determined not to be interrupted by the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight , " round " her grandparents called it , and this seemed to make her conscious of her body , alive to its present and future betrayals . I could see Ellie assess Patty 's thinness . Her face would stay almost blank , almost completely empty , but there was a flickering around her eyes that I recognized from other women I 'd known . It said , Hmm , that 's interesting . What if I looked like that ? Men do n't do this  --  it 's all those years naked together in locker rooms , getting used to the variety of shapes and sizes that bodies come in . Women are more modest . I think they are , anyway . <p> Ellie was alone in her body , with her body , in a way that was , to me , awe-inspiring . There was power in her solitary gawk , her stride over the ice plant , past the low , wind-blasted cedars . I 'd never seen such a fierce unsteadiness , and I said this to Shayla Gray as we watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all the time , do n't you ? " Shayla said . " While she 's stalking around here ? " <p> I told her I thought it might be math . <p> " Nope . She 's praying . " <p> " Praying ? How do you figure that ? " <p> " I do n't figure . I asked her . " <p> " What 's she praying for ? " <p> " You . Me . Her parents . All of us . And especially  --  and these were her exact words  --  for Patty 's body . " <p> I did n't understand , and Shayla said she was n't sure she did either , but the gist of it was that Ellie believed Patty 's body was in revolt . That Patty 's soul was A-OK , but its accommodations had been poorly constructed , poorly maintained . <p> " So what does Ellie think we can do ? " I said , trembling , feeling myself to be on the brink of some wisdom I would n't be able to grasp . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At night , while the kids were watching television and Shayla was translating or at the newspaper , the adults sat outside and talked about the children . It felt as if we were hungry for them , starving , even though they were right there . Talking about them was something like touching them the way we could when they were babies , when we could put their tiny , perfect fingers in our mouths and stroke their satiny bottoms and kiss every inch of their little faces . We talked about them with that same pleasure and desire , all innocence . We talked about how bad they used to be . <p> Kevin , Shamus said , had until just this year loved to run away . Most of the time he did n't go far : Central Park , the Empire State Building . A kid in Manhattan almost could n't get beyond the Hudson or the East River . Usually Kevin left a note saying he 'd lit out because of some punishment or restriction . He liked to make sure everybody understood what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us what time to expect him back , " Shamus said . " Once he went up to his aunt 's when she was living in the Bronx , but she made him call . " <p> But the last time , he said , was Kevin 's tour de force . It was the morning of a day when Shamus was throwing a big reunion bash for Disney animators and muckety-mucks . Like a meeting of the wheat and the chaff , he said . It was quite an affair : caterers , a pianist , young women swishing around with trays of canapes , the works . And Kevin had slept over , but would n't get out of bed . <p> " I looked in on him a couple of times , " Shamus said , " and shook his shoulder , and he 'd groan or something , but he would n't get up . I had to go rushing around , and I was out most of the afternoon . When I got home at five or so , he was still asleep . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw back the covers , and there were pillows and clothes plumped up to look like a body , and one of my ex-wife 's wigs on the pillow , and some old stuffed cow that mooed whenever it was shaken . " <p> And no note . Shamus was furious and scared and about to host a party for fifty people . He finally tracked Kevin down at a friend 's house , Shamus making phone calls while Michael Eisner was scarfing caviar and making deals Shamus wished he was in on . <p> " I wanted to put that kid on ice for a year , " Shamus said , " but I was so impressed with his decoy . I had trouble not slapping him on the back and asking how he thought it up . " <p> Ray and Elizabeth talked about Ellie . Ray did most of the talking , his trembling head seeming to deny every word he said , while Elizabeth sat with her body turned away from us but her face inclined toward the candlelight . In the middle of his story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all glad . There was something in Ray 's face you did n't want to see . He was telling us that Ellie sucked on her left index finger until she was about ten . He could see it was messing up her teeth , and the finger itself was growing crooked and pointed , like a crone 's . <p> " I came up with these byzantine contraptions and punishments and ointments , stuff I cooked up in the lab so it tasted really terrible . Wrapped her finger with first-aid tape . I watched her one night carefully slip off the entire mummy case of tape and fall asleep with that finger in her mouth and a smile on her face . " <p> " It was awful , " Elizabeth said . <p> I could hear the ice in her glass , the catch of gin in her throat . We were all a little drunk . We had important things to tell each other before it was too late . <p> " For a little while , I slapped her , " Ray said . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink too . We all did . " Tough love , " he said with some derision . <p> " As if it was n't already tough enough , " Shamus said . <p> I say we talked about our children , but the truth is I did n't say a word about Patty . I could n't think of one single story to tell . Not one anecdote about her charm , her cleverness , her willful nature , her little tricks and traps and turns of phrase . I just could n't . I needed to keep her to myself , keep her inside me like a secret notion , like an idea whose time has not yet come . <p> On Sunday , a week after we 'd begun the occupation of Shayla Gray 's uncle 's house , we all went to church . It was our first outing since the separate trips to Community Hospital that brought us all together . Most of us who practiced anything were Catholic , so we piled into two cars and drove five minutes to Santa Rosa Church , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To go into church as a visitor has always struck me as entering another life , someone else 's life , but in the middle of it , say at age forty . A little like the way amnesia gets portrayed on television , but not exactly . Conversations are already going on ; there 's a bake sale , but you 've brought nothing to the table . Still , everything looks vaguely familiar . Men and women you 've never seen before shake your hand , smile , and say welcome . When they hand you food , the cup of wine , your name is on their lips . They seem not to notice the infirmity of your corporeal self ; they pay no attention to your deep , even tan , your blue eyes , as if they 've been seeing you every week , all their lives . <p> At Santa Rosa everyone was elderly , our age , maybe a handful under fifty . There were two babies in the arms of a man and a woman who looked much too old to be their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  guitarist , for this was the folk mass  --  and our crew of hurt kids . All around us was stooping and crouching and aching , shattered hips , walkers , the gnarl of arthritis , the flash of bifocals . You could smell the Ben-Gay , the wheaty breath of Metamucil , hear the drybean rattle of nitroglycerin pills , and Doan 's and melatonin . I think we sat Shayla and Kevin and Patty in the middle of the pew for safety  --  their youth was in danger here . Ellie wanted to be on the aisle , and I sat next to her . <p> For reasons I did not understand , we had what 's called a silent entrance , a practice most often reserved for the penitential season of Lent . There was the usual procession , but no music : an altar boy and girl , two lay ministers , and the priest , who seemed in his walk up the aisle to be trying to get a sticky substance off the bottom of his shoes . I realized when he got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had one , maybe two club feet  --  the bones of the tarsus become altered in shape and size and displaced from their proper positions  --  and the movement of his arms and hands , his refusal to look at the congregation , seemed to betray profound embarrassment . I glanced at Ellie and saw that she was clutching her hands together  --  from across the room , they might have appeared to be folded in the attitude of prayer , but I could see that the ends of her fingers were flushed where they pushed on the knucklebones of the opposite hand . Her face was still and rapt and utterly sad . She was the very picture of empathy  --  it was there in the tensed muscles around her eyes , the orbicularis palpebrarum , levator labii superioris . Here was another body in revolt . In that first glance , I wondered if I would have to keep Ellie from running up to the altar and throwing her arms around this priest . <p> Which surely would have knocked him down . I do n't believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at the church bulletin for his name  --  the body of Father Derek Hughes . It was partly a matter of balance . Because Father Derek Hughes had to walk on the insides of his feet , the rest of him moved in a constant sway . He looked like a ship at anchor in rough water . His body seemed to surprise him by being everywhere at once . And he appeared to move more than was necessary . He knocked into both the lectern and the altar as he passed between them . It did not help matters that he was tall , over six feet . When it came time for the little altar girl to hold the missal , she had to balance it on top of her head , and I felt quite afraid for her . I could see Ellie was thinking it too : what if one of those windmilling arms fell suddenly and mightily on the open book ? It could break the child 's neck . <p> The voice of Father Derek Hughes , however , seemed to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and rich , not merely deep . You would say it had breadth , it had atmosphere , the aftershock of thunder , but it was also a little thick , as if he were just recovering from a cold . There was the ghost of an accent too , possibly British , but he 'd left his native land long ago , and the not-quite-clipped quality of his speech made his words seem to roll away from us , disappear , like a face in a dream . But even as he spoke , he was unable to meet the eyes of his congregation . You wanted to help him out , put your eyes before him , like Saint Lucy even , in a dish . As the couple in front of her shifted , Ellie continually repositioned herself to see Father Hughes 's face , try to meet his gaze somehow . I could tell that 's what she was doing because I was doing it myself . <p> Even his glorious voice betrayed him , though . He staggered over words , made mistakes , apologized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he meant to say " This Jesus , " then began the reading again . He had his homily written out , but stumbled there too ; his body would halt him in any way it could . He told of teaching a catechism class in Monterey and having the children draw Adam and Eve , and how one of them drew Adam and Eve in a stretch limo driven by God , cruising down Highway 101 , at the end of which was the Garden of Eden . Adam and Eve were on their way , and God was at the helm . I do n't remember his point , the link between this anecdote and scripture . What I remember is how Ellie leaned forward to listen to him , and how when he told the story about the child 's picture , she laughed more heartily than anyone else . She laughed with pure pleasure , with relief . Her whole body shook . <p> When it came time for the exchange of the peace , Father Hughes made his torturous way down the center aisle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of everyone he could reach . Sometimes priests do that , but not usually past the first few rows . When he shook Ellie 's hand , I could see that his left eye , so blue it was almost violet , rolled at will . It seemed to spin slowly in its socket , unmoored from the rectus muscles that stretch backward like a ready slingshot . <p> He hates this , I thought , every second of it , the publicity of his failure of a body . But here he is . Ellie knew it too , and Patty would learn it , how the body will go to wrack and ruin ; and so would Kevin , though for a while , in his late teens and twenties , he would forget . In the seconds before he invented nylon , Julian Hill had gently moved me out of his way . Suddenly there in Santa Rosa Church I remembered it , his gentleness . I had just burned the back of his hand with a heated glass rod . I was twenty-one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon in December , and we had n't turned on the lights . I was clumsy and in a rush . He said I ought to step aside and take a deep breath . He said , Now just watch . <p> We drove home in silence , and then , it seemed , everyone disappeared , to the beach , I thought , or Shayla may have driven back into town . I did n't know where Patty was . It was lunchtime , but no one came in to make a sandwich , boil an egg , scoop leftovers from the casseroles in the refrigerator . I stood in the kitchen , trying to decide what I wanted myself , and happened to look out the window and into the kitchen of Ray and Elizabeth 's old place . Shayla and Kevin were there , Shayla leaning against the counter . They were talking , it seemed , and then Kevin took a step closer , and Shayla began to unbutton her blouse . He kissed her then , and she kissed him back . They moved a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved his hands , the tips of his fingers , over her breasts . He took off his shirt then , dropped his hands to her waist and lifted her onto the counter , pushing her blouse all the way off her shoulders , and kissed her beautiful white chest , white like plumage against the tan of her arms and throat and belly . Shayla looked down at the top of Kevin 's head and laid her cheek there and smoothed his hair and ran the fingers of her left hand along the side of his neck . Then she raised his chin and brought her mouth down to his . He lifted her off the counter and , limping , carried her out of sight . <p> A few minutes later when I heard their voices outside , I was still breathless , not with my own longing but with surprise at their tenderness , their warm , brown bodies coming to know each other slowly and gently . The silence of it , too , the vortical quiet of held breath . Then they were standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everybody ? " Kevin said . <p> " Well , we 're all right here , " Shayla told him , watching my face . I tried to make my expression mirror hers , which was oracular , her skin flushed beneath her tan , bathed in the noon light , and her eyes not blue at all but darker than any I 'd ever seen . <p> III In the next week , Cambria was shaken by a horrible crime . On Wednesday , a two-year-old girl disappeared from her parents ' motel room . They were visiting from Visalia , a town three hours east , in the San Joaquin Valley . The parents worked for almond growers and had saved all year , maybe several years , to take this vacation . The motel was about a mile down the road from Shayla 's uncle 's place , so the police eventually came to us during their house-to-house search . They found our arrangement very suspicious , and then just plain odd . They wanted to call in the missing spouses for questioning . Where were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin break his leg ? Why did Patty look so ill ? What was Ellie saying ? Speak up , honey , they kept telling her . <p> " It 's the breakup of the nuclear family , " Shayla said , making a stab at levity , but the investigating officer did n't like it one bit . <p> " Miss , " he said . " You need to produce some parents . " <p> It struck us all as a bizarre reversal  --  hilarious even , under different circumstances . But Shayla held on . " Do you know who you have here ? " she said . And then she introduced us : Shamus Culhane , pioneer in the field of animation ; Ray McIntire , the man who gave us Styrofoam . She tapped her finger on the policeman 's fast-food coffee cup . And Lew O'Malley , she said , taking me by the hand , the man who invented nylon . My whole body started . I could n't look at anyone in the room . It must have been too much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to say something to Shayla , but what ? Thanks for the rewrite of history ; thanks for making me what I should have been , what I never could be . But she was n't waiting around . Shayla Gray 's exquisite anatomy followed the police out the door , peeled off from their huddle by the side of the road , and headed to the beach to help look for the corpse of Araceli Torrez . <p> The beachhead was already roped off in several places atop the bluff , mostly to the north , toward the motel . Police were trying to keep bystanders away from these areas , and there was an officer stationed at each of the plank stairways that led down to the water . When I caught up with Shayla , one of these officers was asking why she needed to be on the beach , what she knew that could possibly help . I drew her back , and we stood there watching police and dogs scrabble over the sand . I remembered an afternoon ten years earlier when Patty went missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she said that from the back everybody looked like her mother . A few years later , she said that she was sure somebody would find her if she kept walking . She knew not to go near the surf , but the sand was hot and burned her feet , so she moved down to the water 's edge , where the sand was kept wet by the farthest fingers of each wave . Finally she sat down , then lay down , then fell asleep . For a while everyone thought she belonged to everyone else , but then , when the tide began to come in , and Patty kept sleeping , a woman gathered her in her arms and headed up the beach toward the lifeguard 's tall chair . That 's where we found her . She was so bad to have walked away from us . We said that to her over and over . <p> I was telling Shayla Gray this story , and then I was weeping and holding her in my arms . That was all . That was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live I will never forget the feel of her , the bones of her spine , vertebrae  --  cervical , dorsal , and lumbar . What your hand feels is the centrum , or body , of each vertebra ; the pedicles and laminae reach inward toward the vital organs . Sometimes in Gray 's they look like crossed fingers , reminding you that the strength and duration of the body is a false promise . I felt the muscles , trapezius and latissimus dorsi , and I thought of the weight machines at the gym , where that perfect specimen is depicted , stripped of its skin . Those illustrations always turned my stomach , the body dissected that way . Gray gives instructions about how to do it  --  at the beginning of every chapter : have the subject assume a prone position , with the arms extended over the sides of the table and the chest and abdomen supported by several blocks , so as to make the muscles tense . The illustrations that accompanied these instructions disturbed me too : the body incised along straight lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inside revealed a darkness , a blank mystery that threatened to cancel out all of Dr. Gray 's careful work of knowing . <p> Araceli Torrez 's small body was found facedown on the beach a day later , bloated with salt water . At the press conference , Shayla heard one of the investigators say that her eyes were open and her head was turned seaward so that she appeared to be watching the horizon . Her legs and dark hair were tangled in kelp so that she looked , he said , like the little mermaid . He was beside himself  --  he had small children of his own . " The goddamn little mermaid , " he said two or three times before someone led him out of the room . <p> He said it because that was , at first , what everyone thought : Araceli Torrez was playing out the mermaid story , believing anyone , any girl especially , could swim to the bottom of the ocean and befriend the fishes , grow new lungs and marry the prince . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she died of internal injuries , inflicted most likely by heavy blows to the abdomen . The bruising on her belly and lower back , her thighs , was extraordinary . The parents were questioned , and what the father said was , " I never meant to kill her . " As we watched all this on television , read about it in the paper , Elizabeth McIntire sat in that peculiar pose of hers , her body canted in one direction , her head turned toward sunlight coming through the front window , which she swore she could see on the insides of her eyelids . <p> " Sometimes I 'm glad to be blind , " she said . <p> It is a strange thing to watch a blind person cry . The tears are somehow even more private than those of a sighted person . Dr. Henry Gray has nothing at all to say on this subject . Not a word . <p> We stayed in the house for another two weeks , until the end of August . Shayla went into town  --  to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally one of us went with her , but not often . Usually it was Ellie , who would be dropped off to pay a visit to Father Derek Hughes . Santa Rosa Church is almost directly across the street from Cambria 's one supermarket , and sometimes Ellie and Father Hughes would walk over to pick up a few things for the cook  --  butter , milk , apples for pies , fish on Fridays . Father Hughes insisted on walking . He was trying to give his body to the world , he said . <p> Despite the eight people living in it , Shayla Gray 's uncle 's house was always very quiet , the patient , half-alert quiet of bodies waiting to fall asleep . Shamus kept working on his autobiography  --  " My mere wahs , " he said , and then , " as if anybody 's going to give a damn . " He sat for hours drawing the old characters . Once he said out loud , surprising even himself , " What the hell did I ever see in Betty Boop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent some time , many , many years ago , wondering the same thing . Most of the drawings never got finished . Kevin tried to save them for a while , for the archives , he told me , but then we 'd be short of paper , and on the back of Pluto someone would have to write eggs , sugar , coffee , ground beef . <p> Elizabeth and Ray took long walks together on the beach , sometimes three times a day . They moved slowly , with their heads down , so that they seemed to be looking for something . In the afternoon , they went swimming together . Ray led Elizabeth into the surf , keeping up a running commentary about the height of the waves , the angle , the pitch . When they crashed against her body , Elizabeth never seemed surprised-she never jumped or cried out . She and Ray would wade out to where the water was chest-deep , past the breakers , and then Elizabeth would stretch out on her back , and Ray would raise his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seemed impervious to riptides , the moods of the current . Sometimes he would guide her up the coast a little way , north toward San Simeon , but mostly they stayed in one place , gazing out to sea . <p> The children grew , in those last two weeks , to be like nest mates , puppies or kittens . They often read or watched television leaning against each other  --  Ellie too , with Patty resting on her chest , her own back against a pillow propped on Kevin 's outstretched legs . His cast made a good backrest , and they wrote messages to each other on it , or quotations from their reading . Ellie wrote the beginning of Hamlet 's famous speech , only changed to " To knee or not to knee . " They noted the days passing and the weather , which sometimes they invented or romanticized : " Sunday 8/20 morning squalls . " Patty found a book of poems by Lorca , and at Kevin 's ankle she wrote , " the children observe a point far far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cough remedies grew odder . One was three of the new blue M &Ms,; a sip of Coke followed by a sip of beer , then a sip of vodka . Another , a mark on Patty 's throat made with the ashes of a burned Taco Bell wrapper . <p> Whatever I had witnessed unfolding between Kevin and Shayla did not seem to continue  --  or if it did , perhaps I simply did not notice . I had room in my thoughts only for Patty , for the details of her steady decline . As she weakened , there came to be a great distance in her face . My impulse was often to hold out my hand to her and say , No , what 's your hurry , you just got here , did n't you ? And yet , I want to think of Shayla and Kevin together . I want to think that the subtle language I saw their bodies learning came to be a gentle and generous idiom . I want to believe in that kind of knowledge . I sometimes imagine such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing and darkness and mystery . I imagine that the body 's last breath is visceral that way , the deep , blooming gasp and clutch , our last and best lover 's fingers moving along the grace muscle before the spirit makes use of it to get up and walk away . <p> Five miles down the coast from Cambria on Highway 101 is a place called Harmony , an artisans ' colony . Population 18 , the sign reads , and you can hear the cartoonish voice of the whole little town  --  amused and proud , booming out its isolation , insulation . When we all drove down there at the end of August , we decided Harmony would be a good place to be buried , remote and beautiful , quiet , near enough to hear the ocean without being worn away by it . We asked one of the artisans , the glassblower , if there was a cemetery in town , and when he said no , Shayla wondered aloud what happened to the dead . He pointed to his furnace and smiled . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " What did he say ? " <p> " Light , " Ellie told her . <p> " Of course , " Elizabeth said . " Light . " <p> I should have turned on the light in December , 1931 , in the Du Pont lab . Then I would not have burned Julian Hill 's hand , and he would not have gently moved me out of his way . The last time Patty called out to me , it was three in the morning , and I threw on my bathrobe and went into her room , and though she did not like me to , I turned on the lamp by her bed . At the end she did not want me to see her , the waste of her body , the round moon of her face rising out of the blankets . She closed her eyes , as if this could make her invisible . " Poppy , " she said , and that was all . I lay down beside her , holding her long , still bones that had rotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth flow out of her . It should not have been me , there , then , like that . It should have been a husband , children , and at least eighty years later . It should not have been me there . It should not have been Patty . We ought to have traded places , her damaged body for my good one . Hers that was not big enough to heal itself for mine that was so large and empty on the inside , and , like all bodies , so utterly dark and unknowable . <p> <p> By Liza Wieland <p>
