Dear Dr. Cory : I would like to know why you sometimes get carsick when riding in a car , especially when reading a book . I just have to know ! Nicole Schlomann Sea Cliff , New York Dear Nicole : Carsickness , or motion sickness , can occur when your balance system becomes confused . Your eyes , inner ears , and sensory organs are all part of a balance system that sends signals to your brain . ( These body parts are called proprioceptors and are found in your muscles and skin . ) When your brain gets mixed messages from the balance system , it becomes confused and thinks that it is out of balance , causing motion sickness . For example , when reading in a car , your inner ears and your skin pressure receptors feel the motion of the moving car . However , your eyes see only the pages of your book , which are not moving . Your brain receives messages that do n't match . This makes your brain think that you have lost your balance . Dizziness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the result . Many people find that , eventually , with enough practice , their balance system learns to adjust and they outgrow motion sickness . But until that time , here are some ways to help prevent it : Sit in the front seat and look at distant objects when possible . Your eyes will see the same motion that your body and inner ears feel . Avoid reading while traveling in a car and avoid sitting in a seat that faces backward . Do n't eat spicy or heavy meals before or during a trip . Open a window to help stimulate the skin receptors , giving you a better sense of motion . Take motion sickness medications recommended by your doctor as a last resort . But remember , one of the best ways for children to conquer motion sickness is to allow their balance system to practice adapting to car travel . Dear Dr. Cory : My allergy bothers me when I 'm outside enjoying the nice weather . I take prescription medicine , but I still usually get sick . How can I enjoy being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zack Shaff Aberdeen , South Dakota Dear Zack : It sounds like you might have seasonal allergies . These are allergies that are caused by pollen from trees , grass , and ragweed . Each spring , summer , and fall , tiny grains of pollen are carried through the air . When they hit the nose or throat of someone who is allergic to them , they cause some cells in the body to release the chemical histamine . Histamine causes the small blood vessels in the nose to become bigger . This causes swelling and stuffiness in the nose . Histamine can also cause sneezing ; runny nose ; itching eyes , nose , and throat ; watery , red , swollen eyes ; and coughing . Usually the best way of treating allergies is to find the cause and , if possible , avoid it . Pollen is hard to avoid , and staying inside all summer to do so seems pretty rough . There are some things you can do to help . Try staying indoors during the morning when the outdoor pollen level is at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollen count higher , so you might stay in more often on those days . Some people like to take vacations to places like the seashore , where there is n't as much pollen as in other places . Several medicines can help control seasonal allergies . If the one you 're taking is n't helping , ask your doctor about trying another one . Allergy shots can also reduce allergy symptoms . If you have n't already , you may want to see a pediatric allergist , a doctor who specializes in treating children 's allergies . Dear Dr. Cory : Can you tell me what a heart murmur is and how it affects your health ? Julian Velasquez Pueblo , Colorado Dear Julian : A murmur is a noise that doctors or nurses hear between the " lub " and " dub " sounds of the heartbeat . One type of murmur , an innocent murmur , is caused by the normal noise of the blood flowing through the heart . Innocent murmurs are difficult to hear . They are very common in preschool and school-age children . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to restrict their activity . Innocent heart murmurs do not lead to heart disease . Many of them go away on their own as a child gets older . Heart doctors , or cardiologists , do n't know why they start or why they go away . Other types of murmurs are often associated with a diseased heart valve . The type of treatment depends on the cause of the murmur . See you next issue ! Your friend , Cory SerVaas , M.D. Footnote <p>
