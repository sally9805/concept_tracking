For eighteen years a terrible thought crept through my nature , my ideas and my feelings . I used to blanch and tremble , I was awe-stricken out of fear . Today I blanch and tremble and I am awe-stricken out of passion . My life is in full bloom : my temper is like that of a dog gone rabid from thirst . There is but one mood in my eyes and my soul , one will in my ideas and realizations , one feeling on my tongue and in my heart . If I were to commit a crime , I would not conceal it ; if I commit it in my thoughts , I 'll confess it . Everything inside me seeks an exit , strives for expression and finds it . I lose my temper quickly , unexpectedly , madly ; when I quarrel , when I drink , when I make love , when I sing . One glass makes me drunk , one look drives me crazy , one phrase enraptures me . Everything is speed , moment and instinct . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling without analysis . My nature is-opposition ; my logic - indiscipline ; my philosophy-revolution . Puberty ! Everything is finally crushed : goodness , holiness and familiarity : a quarter of an hour 's embracing and kissing renders more pleasure than all that which kept me home . At the bosom of the most lowly woman I forget my family , my upbringing and shame ; and when I am at home , I only remember that I was able to forget at anybody 's breast all that now surrounds me , traps me and makes me bitter . A drunken party exhilarates me as much as a woman ; only with a hangover am I able to write poems . I do not distinguish between the grammar school student , the servant and the prostitute , nor between wine , beer and brandy . I drink to get drunk and to make love until I am full . In brief , I love everything that my father condemns . He is grave , sober and ethical . For him , life begins with marriage ; for me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love , goodness : the New Testament ; I am enchanted by passion , violence , crime : the Old Testament . His ideal is Christ the Redeemer ; mine is Devil the Seducer . To him , a prostitute is loathsome ; to me she is luxurious . He would say : the family is the reaction to a brothel ; I would say-a brothel is the opposition to the family . In a word , I am an oppositionary , and he is a reactionary . <p> But we do n't discuss it . When I am out all night drinking , he is taciturn , sullen and offended . I stay out a second night , and he is silent , he smiles and leaves . And a third night out would be too much .... I write poems , he writes memoirs . Our eyes rarely meet ; we become confused and both look down : he wants to say something to me , I want to say something to him .... He once said , " It is nice that you work and write poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I was upset : I can only write poems with a hangover.I wrote , " I like Jews for their perversity is one of revolt , crime and sin ; idealism begins with the first uprising of the angels , humanity with the institution of hell , life with the murder of Cain , and poetry with the discovery of Satan . " If my father were to read this , he would praise my work , but would criticize the ideas , and yet all of my poetry of pleasure rebels against work . <p> For eighteen years a terrible thought crept . When was it that I first took notice of it ? I suppose it was some years ago when I suddenly awoke in my bed and squeezed my eyes shut in front of my father who had come to wake me . He left immediately , and I suspected that he had found me out . He began to watch me more carefully since . Five years ago , I came home drunk and threw up the wine . My father said sternly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and it is harmful for you . " Four years ago , in grammar school , I lit a cigarette in the street . My father , displeased , said " You smoke and moreover you are spiteful ; and smoking is unhealthy , spite is a sign of malice and stupidity . " So again he spoiled my fun . Three years ago my mother dismissed a maid on my account and my father did not speak to me for a week . He saw me in the company of a coquette and pretended not to see me . I did not want to see him . If he had said but one word of displeasure in the street , it would have been easier , I would have felt happier and more relaxed . But his silence spoiled the fun . At home he reprimanded me very seriously and peacefully ( while I was still trembling from her kisses ) : " That is not a woman for you ; she will corrupt you . " The latter offended me . Disheartened , I turned away and thought:Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a reaction to my nature , my ideals , my inclinations , and my nature is the opposition to all his advice , beliefs and wishes .... One time I slapped a schoolmate who had spoken ill of a young lady . My father kindly said ( while my palm still itched ) : " It is nice of you to defend the honor of those who deserve it ; but slapping someone is never honorable , for it humiliates both the slapper and the slapped . " And again I turned away in anger , thinking : I defended a lady 's honor only in order to slap the fellow , and in this too he has to spoil my fun . Too often my father went for walks with me and talked , but I walked and talked listlessly ; but I had to conform to his will because he never said " you have to . " And he would speak so kindly that it was difficult for me to contradict ; he stated his beliefs so humbly that I could not dare to refute . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the third glass he would say " enough , " while I would have enjoyed only those that would follow . I drank the first few only to please him , and would only end up displeased with him . <p> Thus , due to the most insignificant daily events , I came to wish he was n't there . Sometimes I considered running off into the world , but he would n't even give me the motive for that . Always kind , silent and peaceful , he indirectly suppressed my desires , my passions and instincts . And the more wanton I became , the more discontented and muffled I was in front of him . I kept quiet , with my tail between my legs . His politeness and soberness bothered me even more because they gave me no pretext for a harsh word or a more determined step . My openness and passion would disperse miserably in his presence . The tension of my rapture , my will , my blood constricted ever more aloofly and limply . Thus that thought crept ; thus in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listlessly , listened to him unresponsively , replied dully . In front of him I acted affectedly , artificially and formally . And then that thought dug deeper into my soul . Calmly and coldly I would wish for him not to exist , to disappear , to be gone forever . And in so thinking , something light , wanton and joyful would smile inside me , around me , far from me . Like a prisoner gazing at a bright blue sky and thinking of freedom . His gray beard , his deep wrinkles and tired steps inspired such distant , blue and endless images . My eyes would fill with sighs , my back with tremors . In the long silence interrupted by our steps , the squeaking of sand , the rustle of leaves and his heavy breathing something thick , luxurious and dreamy would gather on the horizon , in my soul and in my eyes . When we parted , he would leave slowly and gloomily , full of cigar smoke . And I ran to my Anka , squeezed her hands and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . Surrounded by women and wine , I would raise my tail again . And there I felt that the thought was in my blood . <p> For eighteen years it crept .... Already in my childhood I would sometimes wish for the death of someone to whom my life had inextricably tied me . I would wish it out of some kind of curiosity , the same curiosity which drove me to watch women take off their clothes or push my finger into my neighbor 's hose . But all the curiosities of a powerless child turned into a young man 's powerful passion . Even today , when my father has for several months been ill with cancer , which is cured by death , I feel a rush of blood , tears and bile , and I make love , drink and sing furiously . Inside me , hatred , pain and pleasure are one : the wounds on my father 's throat which leak soup , the pestilent breath of catarrh , pus and spoiled blood , my father 's anger , ill temper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimands , my mistress , the orgies and the thoughts-keep me in eternal ecstasy , passion and heat . When I approach my father , he is angry because I had left him alone ; he is angry if I speak too loudly ; he demands that I read the newspaper to him , then falls asleep after the third line , but awakes immediately if I stop . When he calls for me , I hide in my room . There I write poems , and my mother keeps peeking in and is shocked at my callousness and indifference . In front of my father , she defends me , in front of me , she defends my father . " You go around with bad women , you drink with vagrants , you laugh and write as if there is nothing wrong . And your father is dying . What will people say ? You are disgracing both him and me and the honor of our family . And your father is dying . " <p> Her refrain reverberates in the semi-darkness of my room and rings irritatingly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life like that before , jealous of the noisy charm of the world , saying : " What will your father say ? " Now that the catarrh has destroyed my father 's throat , she says : " What will people say ? " <p> The house is filled with bile , malice and stench . If I am at home , I am not allowed to laugh , talk , read , eat . And if I leave , it 's even worse . My mother fears my father and the world . She speaks of honor , love and respect . She calls to my mind the images of death , sables and mourning . The death of the head of the family fills her with apprehension : she even wrote to her brothers to come . Huge tears cover her glowing face and I get the impression that she is using my father 's death for her purely maternal interests : the illness , she thinks , will make me always stay at home , her brothers will come , we shall all renounce our work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhappiness and closeness . <p> The sun is in the West . The last flames are melting through the drawn curtains . Glowing pieces of something invisible are falling on my head . Visions of molten metals , feelings and images are dancing in front of me . My eyes are hot , my throat is dry , my back on fire . I have torn apart several manuscripts . <p> This one thought is swirling , breaking and throwing me to and fro . The house is like a dungeon : dull , ill-humored , silent . My mother is the disciplinarian with her entertainment and threats . For eighteen years I was taught that the family is the only holy thing one must never mingle with . That was my father 's law , his religion , his ethics : all that is good comes from it and returns to it . For eighteen years my father was forging chains so that in the moment when he lost his strength he would have slaves at his disposal . <p> All the while , Anka is waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair falls down her forehead like a liquid mixture of grease , jam and syrup . Her lips are hard and small like those of a Greek goddess . Her eyes are wide like a dyed peacock 's . Her hands soft and warm as feathers . Her skirts cling to her body . Her shape is nervous , undecided . She promised to come to the woods tonight , with laughter on her lips , tears in her bosom and passion in her eyes . I promised to read my poems to her . I have turned all the dry and explosive matter of her female soul on fire . At noon I met her and looked at her in daylight on the hot pavement with a look that made me sweat and made her blush . She comes from an excellent family , slightly frightened and very innocent . But above all , she is reckless . She listens to my poems and understands nothing , but feels everything . They confuse her so much that she looks sleepy and lost . <p> " In you I love sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her the other day in the park , while the sun was shining on the flowers and her hair , and her cheeks turned red from love , the summer , the fever and the vanity . Thus she loses her virginity in every touch of our knees , our breath , our lips . " I am the Devil , " I always tell her when I want to flatter her . At dusk I squeeze her hand and she responds like an echo . <p> Anka is waiting for me . There is nothing gay in her youth nor charming in my love . The thought of my father and my mother , their senile interests , this house turned into a hospital in the dungeon-all that overemphasizes Anka , my passion and the wonders of the world . My thoughts are clear . The laws of life grow in me and from me . Death both explains and justifies . Why should I care about the consequences ? Even the worst life is justified by death . My decision is clear , my problem is solved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment my mother called me to help her take my father to the bathroom . He held on desperately to our shoulders ; his back hunched , his knees bent ; he is digging his fingers into us . He is all sweat , groaning and stench . His lower lip is quivering and the whole room quivers with it . He leans on us . With this final longing of his body for life he has turned us into objects , mute matter , crutches . He does not realize that he is hurting us , he does not even think that this can hurt . He has no pity for us . He is treating us as if we were a handkerchief , crutches , socks . . things he has bought for his needs . The yellow dressing on his wounds reaches to my nose . My senses are but rags to him . <p> We left him there and nearly closed the door . He is breathing hard and straining while his curses are lost in his catarrh . He keeps squeezing his eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive pain , his body has become elastic . A young puppy peeks through the door and opens its mouth and eyes wide . The wrinkles in my mother 's face have turned black . My father 's gray hair is trembling ; the space is filled with the stench of decay . Father ca n't do it . He 's trying to force himself and becomes smaller ; his chin hits his breasts ; he is moaning , sweating and choking . His skinny , bony hands are beating his knees . I notice how much weight he has lost , how he is suffering and raging . The dressing on his wounds is smeared deep yellow . He ca n't do it . For the last time he desperately hits his knees and the dressing becomes wet . Blood is dripping on his shirt , his breasts and knees . I turn pale . <p> We take him to his bed . The smell of blood makes me dizzy ; my father 's eyes open and pierce my breast . This time , as an exception , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . I uncover his throat : the two holes stare at me like two hollow eyes . Anka 's image is bloodied in my thoughts ; I think of her and my father 's blood colors the image . Anka is bathed in blood , pain and terror . <p> It 's getting dark . A spray of yellow blood dries on my fingers . Those two eyes now not only stare , but breathe . The thick , humid and greasy smell makes me sleepy , giddy and draws me closer . I just might fall onto my father 's breast . A dog is whimpering in the hall ; I do n't know why . My mother whips it . The sharp blows echo from his soft , young and plump body . Those two eyes stare at me fixedly : I feel as though I were looking at hell . It smells of sulfur , burning and corpses . The smells daze me , the sounds irritate me ; my father 's face becomes a grimace , his lower lip large , white and dribbling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those colors , those sounds turn solid , rigid and , like an iron fist , they grab my throat , my breast , my heart . Everything is filled with matter : the sound of the blows , the smell of decay and the color of blood . My senses are filled with flesh , my images colored in blood . I do n't know what I 'm doing . It 's like my father , my mother and myself are but a shapeless mass of flesh , like in a butcher 's shop . Our feelings and thoughts are but a solution smelling of protoplasm , blood and garbage ; our souls but a cesspool of carnal mass . <p> When I left his room , my mother was still scolding the dog . He had gotten into the bathroom and drunk my father 's blood , licking the dirty stone even more passionately under her blows . <p> The sun set quite a while ago . I wo n't be on time . Anka must have already left . As I was leaving , my mother said beggingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am all alone . God knows whether your aunt will come tonight . Return immediately . " <p> Her eyewhites were gray . <p> We wired my brothers to come . Mother wanted me to write : " Father is dying . " She is doing all she can to gather us all around the hearth . My brothers are coming . And they will join my mother in forcing me to stay at home and forget about Anka . <p> My senses are still filled with my father 's blood , his wounds and the stench . The sounds of soft and greasy blows resound in my ears . Everything is driving me into my lover 's arms . Right away , now , while I 'm still full of sick smells and cruelty . My father was bending in my arms and I never thought it might be painful for him.Just like my back was bending under his fists and he had n't thought it might hurt me . My mother beat the dog into a bloody pulp for drinking my father 's blood . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thirsty . I will scare her so badly that she will be terrified and die of anemia . My words will fear for her and drink her blood . Life is a bloodsucker . <p> The forest is black . The lamp throws feeble light ; the dusty path , like a night ghost , white between the dense layers of trees and darkness . Even the powerless sky expects a crime . Oh , to look at her now ! In her white dress ! And to bloody the whiteness of her clothes , her soul and her youth . And she 's not there . She does n't answer my calls . In vain ! I called , I looked , I yelled . The darkness swallowed my voice and my gaze . If I could only find her now . Now , that she has made me so irritable , so angry , now that she has provoked me . Now , in the solitude and darkness . Now that my father has set me on fire , has warmed my blood . To whom would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is dying . Where would the crime lead me ? Certainly not home . <p> I walked down the main street looking for her . I walked to her windows . There she is , at the window . Will she come down ? She apologizes . We walk down the long tree-lined path . She is chatting away . I 'm not listening . We go farther and farther , where there is less light , fewer lamps . How many times I could not decide on such a step : to seduce an excellent girl and a virgin with only one goal-to leave her . Consideration and respect for human virtue was nothing but the belittling and despising of my nature and my beliefs . My upbringing was in that case stronger than my instincts ; my family stronger than my individuality . All of it-my father 's horrible nets . His goodness , politeness and kindness prevented me from such a step , which in his eyes would be evil , vulgar and criminal . But his dribbling , large , white lips , the holes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desperate , unconscious , animal grip of his hands-his inconsideration of my senses , disrespect of my feelings and belittling of my literary work-had not all of that finally set me free ? My good , nice and kind father uncovers himself in front of his youngest son and allows with a clear conscience his youngest child to touch with his eyes , his nose and his fingers the ugliness and crudeness of the body . <p> I come to and look at Anka . She brought me back . I squeeze her hand angrily . <p> " Where are you going ? " ( She resists . ) " Why are you going back ? " She looks at me suspiciously and retreats : <p> " You have been so quiet . You are so rude today . " <p> " Forgive me . I was lost in thought . My father is dying . What I said was stupid . " She was surprised : <p> " And you , you left your father . " I hated her with a vengeance . I took her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a word . Because of you . You understand . " <p> I drag her to the side . She resits . She 's crying . Her writs are breaking . <p> " Your father ! Your father ! " <p> The forces desert me . I hated my father . I wished he would die . Anka 's words are full of venom and narcosis . She goes back . I lag behind . I do n't know whether I walked Anka home . I 'm hurrying somewhere , pushing and stumbling . Nobody wants to tell me I 'm being rude . And that 's all I 'm waiting for . I understand nothing but my anger . I ca n't justify anything but my absurd desire for somebody to call me rude . I went into a brothel . Zora is inviting me to her room . The passion has frozen inside me . I drown it in beer and then we went up . I offered her a lot of money . She lay on her stomach . We are both suffering . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man .... But I fall on her back omnipotently and sob . I 'm disgusted with myself . I can do anything I want with her . . while what I wanted to do out of spite and anger ... I could n't .... My freedom has to be purchased . I went looking for it in a brothel , among slaves .... I left . <p> The lamps , the stars and the lighted windows tire my eyes . I 'm struggling to find a thought , but I find only sweat , noise and melancholy . What is this now ? I see this afternoon and the ecstasy of my senses . A great sigh of pleasure and freedom penetrates the forest , the skies and the images of my fantasy . A bloody breath comes from my father 's body and falls , thickened , onto the whiteness of my love . I know , what I can do . Dew is glittering on the flowers , the leaves and the grass , and the big , icy scythe of death ravages the meadows . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Can I go home now ? Something huge was inside me and it wanted out . And now it seemed as if it had been nothing , and as if there is nothing inside me . I call my verses , the visions of my imagination , the illusions of my images for help . The house stopped enchanting me so long ago-the brothel profaned freedom . And there I could do what I wanted to . . . something unnatural-out of spite , anger , curiosity . But what I wanted , I could not do . <p> The night is falling down a steep cliff . Our earth is an abyss . The whole lighted city looks like a hole filled with flies and worms . The sky is also a hole , a starry one . And wherever I look , I see holes . My sighs linger around the hole , which is humid , dark and endless . <p> Last night I came home a bit drunk , but fully aware . I threw up in the bathroom . My mother poured water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been drinking . Why did you let me change the dressing on father 's wounds ? Why did I have to see his wounds ? " I drank out of desperation . I was disgusted , so I drank . I drank and got sick again . I stayed at home today . That brandy should harm me bothers me more than everything else . It is a disaster in my age , like being impotent with a naked woman . It shames me . I would be totally destroyed if my mates were to find out about it : I was always so proud of the fact that I can hold my liquor . <p> I am helping my mother , taking care of my father ever so kindly , quietly and humbly . My father looks at me now and then and his gaze remains as if it were written in the air . The sun is sneaking through the window and the red rays slide down the wooden floor lustfully , reaching the polished bed . Father would like to say something , but he immediately lowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while , the sun keeps merrily sliding through the sky and over the floor , down my hangover and my sad thoughts . <p> I think I have managed to convince even myself that it was n't the brandy that harmed me . My aunt arrived and I kissed her hand three times . I saw the milkmaid to the door and in my thoughts I kissed her blond hair and healthy blush of her cheeks and shawl . I peek through the window and the people passing by leave a pleasant sense of movement . A girl appears from the neighboring house and laughs at my gazes . I stare at her , and her teeth remain white anyway . <p> I forget about Anka . I become more quiet , considerate and sly . Now my mother thinks I 'm an excessively sensitive and dutiful son . I have convinced her and shall convince her . It would be awful if she were only to think that brandy could have harmed me . That would be a great argument for her to fight against my binges , babbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sadness came over me and I fell asleep in my chair . In this half-dream I saw my father mysteriously beckoning me to follow him . He was smiling sadly and mockingly and was pointing to the sea , the islands and the dusk . Then he left , waving good-bye . <p> When I woke up , I thought about the dream , for I could find no connection or interpretation in the context of what was happening . Now even my dream makes me think when I 'm awake . It was so simple and melancholic . The large , gray and dead sea ; the islands like frozen ships on which everything living had died , except for a dog which announces the death of its masters like a bell . This dead and gray landscape touches me deeply . A great sense of peace descends on my soul . I am amazed that throwing up had destroyed and shamed me , while all my father 's and mother 's suffering and my criminal thoughts had elevated and warmed me . Through this silence of my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , the ones my father forged and what the freedom that my being demanded . In my father 's presence I could feel everything but instinct ; in front of him all my thoughts , feeling-and limbs-would droop impotently . Goodness , kindness and politeness were irreconcilable with the essence of my youth . The feeling of embarrassment and sexual impotence would grow from the very thought of my father , who might find out about my adventures and speak to me about them . And his daily presence , the looks and conversations were only the prevention and destruction of the growth and flourishing of my idea , which could flow out and away only far from him . Furthermore , I could not even tell my father that this was what I needed , let alone ask him about his youth . Thus all our conversations would anxiously evade the subject which may have been my only crucial question and the reason for our animosity . And when I saw him ill , powerless and degenerated , my thought that had crept for eighteen years and was keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from head to foot . <p> It is amazing ; it stupefies me and makes me think ; I believe I should sooner miss my father 's funeral than a date . And I 'm not fighting this feeling , but neither does it enchant me like it did yesterday . And this thing , so amazing when I think about it , becomes so natural , when I begin to feel . Nor am I ashamed that it is improper , shameful and criminal ; that it is beastly , savage and total corruption . There is no fight between good and evil in me now , but right now evil does n't fascinate me either . That vomiting that had destroyed me , shamed me and given me a bad conscience makes all my enchantment a naive illusion . And I believe that even my father would laugh sadly and mockingly about it , just like he did about that dead landscape . At the verge of death-what is it all to him ? His advice , my mother 's tears , my vomiting . <p> " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt her hands on my back and we both shivered . " He wanted Auntie to leave the room . Your brothers are coming tonight , but he 's only asking for you . " <p> I went out slowly . My mother 's unusual voice confused and frightened me . I thought of meeting my father 's gaze . <p> The sun is yellow and the west is bathed in thick light . The windowpanes reflect colors like lighted candles in a mirror . I am overcome by curiosity : my father is asking for me . What will he say to me ? What does he want to tell me ? I 'll kiss his hand , if he is dying . <p> Everything around me tells me that something holy , great and ordinary is happening . The dog lies under the table and the flies have stopped buzzing . <p> My mother touched my sleeve , then kissed me . My eyes filled with tears . I feel as if moths were buzzing in both orifices , and maggots were lazily crawling along my bones . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the three of us . He is going to say something , I think , and I wait silently . This great silence really does convey something great , holy and magnificent . Mother and I wait patiently . Father speaks only through motion : would I close the door ? We close it . Could we raise him up a little ? He points to the bedside cabinet : a book ? his rosary ? I do n't understand . I look to my mother . She understands immediately and puts the chamber pot on the bed . But father is speaking : Does he want to get off the bed ? Yes . We lift him to his feet . I put the chamber pot under him . I never even think : Is this what he wanted to tell me ? My father is standing upright , he looks taller . But suddenly-I stepped back . My mother caught him with her last strength . His eyes open so terribly like they want to speak . A short , surprised , uncomprehending look and my father drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour my mother , my aunt and I argue . Auntie called the priest and I said I would throw him out . I begin to feel that it is upon me to defend the beliefs and the honor of my father . Auntie is in a congregation . She says it is upon her to protect the reputation of the family . She is very angry , probably because father not the holy sacrament . I see clearly how she would like to influence our family , to have some rights ; at least , to take her share . There is so much lust and interest in her arguments that I feel she is infringing on my birthright . Mother keeps crying and is more upset that I wo n't allow the priest to come than that father died . We left the dead one alone . My aunt is shouting at the top of her voice that she will not do a thing , that she will not move before the priest arrives . She even tried to throw me out : I had profaned the deceased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of my own father when I was in the company of bad women . Only now did I begin to feel a deep love for my father and in arguing with my aunt I came to believe that I had loved him more than anybody else . " He asked for me " -I say maliciously- " and did n't even mention you . " That pleases my mother too . She approves , she comes to life : the dead man had brought the son back to the family . She kisses me passionately , she cries and takes me to my father 's room . <p> " He is ours , " I feel as if my mother is saying . " He 's mine , " I seem to reply triumphantly . " We shall see , " my aunt seems to whisper sarcastically . And the growing silence , the malice that can not speak , the interests always hard at work-develop a silent battle about a corpse , and each of us flatters his egotism ; we remember that we have some beliefs and principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body that has already started to smell . Something new appears inside me . With my father 's decay I begin to feel an ever more passionate love for him . The self-respect , the imperative tone , my aunt 's impertinent showing-off waken my duties as a son , my rights and feeling and my youthful nature of decisiveness , energy and defiance . I went to the coroner , to the undertaker 's , I wired our relatives , and in a quarter of an hour I took care of everything and returned full of energy , passion and strength-just to show that I was master around here . Entering the apartment , I ran into a monk ; I hurried to the door , waited for him and told him : " He did n't ask for you . " <p> My aunt opens the door . The monk is smiling . I 'm ready to push him down the stairs , but he says he has been asked to come . I let him pass and say behind his back : <p> " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , but while he was alive , he believed in god , but not in priests ; and monks he detested , because he was industrious , worldly and ethical . " But my aunt deafened my words . <p> The new feeling is growing and developing inside me . The very fact that the priest came despite my protests-the fact that things went the way my aunt wanted them-provokes my youthful vanity , honor and temper . For the first time in my life I feel that I have beliefs which I must affirm as consistently as possible . What 's more , the role of my father 's defender delights me . My aunt said : " you were drinking while he was dying and yet you now want to defend his honor . " She wants to disarm me . And can I really talk of ethics ? Can I show that my words are-pure defiance . My aunt has also concealed her desire to rule , to advise and to protect under the veil of religion . Am I just concealing my defiance as principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning into-principles . So many words come to my lips , so much passion in my heart , so many ideas in my mind . The coroner arrives . He examines and concludes . I am at his service . I take him to my room so he can wash , I give him a clean towel , hand him his hat ; I bow and see him to the door . Thanking him for everything , on everybody 's account . My eighteen years enjoy the politeness no end , the talking of important matters , with the proper posture and excellent person , and provokingly and at the same time politely I showed my aunt : I was as polite to the coroner as I was with the monk . I received the coroner with more respect than she showed the priest . Indeed . And I am necessary in the family and in this grave occasion . Even more than that . In receiving the coroner I felt like I was bringing into the house an opposition to the reactionary , to the ignorance and-to my aunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit out all those insults and slander of his son . And I was the only child who had been with him . My brothers are arriving now . I can hear the ear . It 's them ! <p> How my head feels enlightened . How the horizon is clearing , the duty and my thoughts . For eighteen years a thought .... And I had kept my tail between my legs . But now there is no tail . <p> I began to feel flattered by playing the role of a grown man : even though I was the youngest , I will be the one to talk of my father 's illness , his suffering and his life with understanding and experience . For my brothers were absent , and my mother knows nothing of politics , literature or medicine . <p> Yes . It is them . My brothers will weep . I will comfort them , I will say : It 's better this way . If you had witnessed his suffering , you would feel better now . It 's easy for you to mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first and the second . The third one could n't make it . He 's abroad . I forbid my mother to go to meet them . You will cry , I said , and that will only make it worse for them . And I was thinking , I shall explain to them . Nicely , quietly , soberly . There is so much kindness , goodness and politeness in my every move , thought and word . To protect my father and comfort my brothers ! Ah ! What a magnificent image of the deceased arose in my mind . My brothers wo n't understand it ; they had n't seen him . But me ! I saw two holes through which soup poured out ; in the bathroom he had tried to force himself so fiercely that a stream of blood fell to the floor and the dog drank father 's blood , while I was looking at the two holes through which hell came pouring out . And what will they be able to tell me about ? There they are , hesitating : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage ! And what would they have done had they faced what I faced ? What will they tell me about ? Drinking , women , vomiting . But about cancer , about cancer , about cancer ! About decomposing , decay , holes ! And what is all the pleasure in the world compared to one moment of terror ! <p> Oh , my brothers . My brother , come into my arms ! Take courage . My brothers notice that I have grown in the year they have n't seen me . I talk self-confidently and I choose my words . I explain in detail how the illness developed ; how the catarrh choked my father and how that had finished him off . How cancer has remained incurable and unexplained to this day . What 's more , today while everyone was sleeping , I took " Home Medicine " and carefully read the passage on cancer several times . Cancer is intensified by psychological suffering , the writer says . Cancer is hereditary , he goes on to say . That 's very important to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can make my father 's image more grandiose . In front of my brothers I stress his liberal beliefs , his education , the spiritual battles of the paterfamilias , the clash between the problems of freedom and discipline in raising the children . I explain his tragedy : such a kind , good and polite man , and he had to die of the harshest disease , uncovered in front of his son like Noah ; he , a man of ideals , to have a chamber pot for his last wish . My brothers look at me with respect and delight while I go on and on praising the deceased . Finally I add : <p> " His illness was so unexpected and illogical like deus ex machina arriving in our modern tragedy to untie the knot with illness and death . " <p> And with these words , which make me more important , I commemorate my father and enjoy the respect gained with my commemoration . <p> My brothers are silent . They are not writers . I feel I am the most extinguished person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obituary for the newspaper . I wrote the letters for our relatives . They only signed them . Even my aunt gave consent to that . <p> I am alone . The funeral is tomorrow . Accidentally I think of Anka . And immediately a dark thought comes : tomorrow I shall have to walk behind my father 's coffin dressed in black . What would happen if I were to refuse ? <p> That spoils my mood . I have always made fun of all formalities ; if I now consent to them , I shall be mocking myself . That worries me so much that I descend from the heights to which I had risen . Again I am upset , I sweat and suffer : what will my friends say ? Once we made fun of a friend who inherited a lot of money from his father , paid for our wine and wore a black band around his sleeve . " It 's because of others " - he tried to justify himself . I was the first to attack this justification which was really a condemnation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no significance , which only has significance in vulgarity , dictate who is qualified for our weddings-the priest ! How can a ridiculous formality dictate how we are to behave , how to act-how can it rule our souls and minds ? We comply with tradition because it is insignificant ; but we feel no shame that insignificant things play such a major role in our lives , because we ourselves have become formal , vulgar , worthless . .. <p> And he replied : <p> " You only talk that way because you have as yet had no opportunity to fight formality . " <p> " Your wedding will be the first ! " <p> " I shall not marry . " <p> " Your exams the second . " <p> " That has a practical purpose . " <p> " The third shall be death ! " <p> " We shall see . " ( My blood was hot from the wine . ) " Besides , if anyone in my family dies , I will be neither sorry nor glad .... My father will leave me nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Thus we argued drunkenly and insulted our benefactor in the name of principle . <p> That stupid drunken brawl seems even more stupid now and upsets me more . I fruitlessly try to capture the peace I felt this morning , the seriousness , importance and propriety . Neither the dream of my father smiling mockingly , nor the vomiting which has turned me noble overnight , nor my father 's last wish which I expected with fear and curiosity , nor the fight with my aunt about the deceased can divert me from this mood , lighten it and make any importance given to trifles just an illusion . <p> In vain do I try to think of Anka . A terrible thought attacks me again , the thought that had lost its tail with my father 's death . This thought is the more enchanting because it contains an endless curiosity . How would it be if I were alone , all alone ? And all the spasms of my nerves bounce off like waves-off my mother .... <p> Clouds are heavy in the sky . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could n't part with this haunting solitude so suddenly . My mother and aunt must be weeping ; my brothers are entertaining the ladies . I recognized the voices of three girls from the neighborhood , three naughty and merry brunettes . Strange ! I could not stand female company now . I would be ashamed to show sorrow ; and if I were to act merry , I 'm afraid I might offend . And that 's consideration ! <p> I am again plagued by the question of mourning blackness . That too is consideration : double consideration ! Consideration of traditions represented by my mother and of my principles acquired with my friends over a glass of wine . It is uncanny : my own principles torture me , retreat , fail upon me and retreat once more . But they do not carry me off . they do not delight me anymore . So , before I would sooner have missed a funeral than a date ! And now I could n't go to the funeral in anything but a black suit ! I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women quickly weakens the seriousness I had maintained since the arrival of the priest and which I decided to maintain at any price throughout the funeral . Beauty , charm , lust , fragrances , looks and clothes fill me with passion , and now it requires my principles-the principles which are expressed by sobriety , peace and dignity . What a naive reply it would be to say : " I 'm not wearing black because it is against my principles ! " As naive as the believers who do penance after confession look in the eyes of both believers and non-believers . It was enough for me to hear female voices and my principles have become just as naive-like penance , like . . . the black suit . The black suit is my mother 's principle , but also the tradition , like greeting someone with " How do you do , " which nobody takes as a real , literal question . And not saying it reeks of savageness and stupidity . Finally , a patriotic duel and a drunken party delight more than moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I being liberated from ? <p> Was n't I enchanted with atheism , freedom , revolution because of my temper and my age ? Principles ! Wherever did I acquire them ? Over a glass of wine , during demonstrations , in the coarsest intercourse . Wherever I smashed things , yelled or kissed . And is n't that precisely what my father condemned and what humiliated me in his presence ? <p> What dis I lierate myself from ? <p> My mother is still here . I get rid of my principles , but not of kisses , wine and rousing . No , there is absolutely no reason not to consent to my mother 's wish . <p> It 's better to keep quiet . All that is coming-the funeral , the mass , the black suit-is so trivial that I am truly ashamed that my youth of revolution , passion and pleasure has anything to do with it . Truly : my father 's death was my secret , my thought and sigh . Father was an obstacle to my feelings , thoughts and movements . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove me . The fact that I never discussed my writing with him the way I discussed it with enemies-that fact alone was a deep and crushing reason of our estrangement . And the slackening of my passions in his presence was more than a rein and a whip-it was a chain . <p> For eighteen years I embellished my secret of which I only spoke when drunk . This strange , passionate and elementary thought passed from abstraction into reality and so my father 's death became freedom . And only thus could it delight me without a bad conscience and become a sigh , desire , instinct-of which I did not have to be ashamed , just like I did n't have to be ashamed of my beliefs and needs . All the nakedness was covered : My father 's death is only a criminal thought , a tragic idea . <p> And while my thought thus covered , embellished and painted itself compressed into one abstract word-freedom-there was so much impudence , energy and greatness in it . And every step towards death was a step towards freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from freedom . <p> And the very realization of an ideal ? And freedom itself ? What has been written in my spiritual history these last three days ? Reality writes : the chamber pot , the priest , the funeral , wreaths , the mass ; and my soul remembers : visions , the horror of sin and crime , the bad conscience about vomiting , insisting on my principles out of defiance , praising my father out of egotism and vanity and consenting to formalities out of the fear of naivete . <p> Feelings ever more vulgar , behavior ever more polite and thoughts ever more trivial . <p> No , I ca n't even think anymore . In vain I try to find something to delight me . Only those distant thoughts and unclear visions of other chains ; my mother 's strong desire that I should wear my black suit , my friends who will remind me of my principles , my opposition to the traditions , my passion to seduce women and have them like me . All these thoughts of all the chains around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freedom becomes concrete in the death of everyone including myself . <p> Why did I begin to analyze myself ? Why contemplate ? Why express my ego ? The contents are so pale , so feeble , so mundane , so impotent , cowardly and listless . <p> I can not draw one conclusion out of all this ! One idea ! One feeling ! One belief ? One decision ! <p> Analysis has made me distracted , lost , impotent and confused . At the funeral I walked as properly , normally and mechanically like everyone else , even though I felt so distracted and lost . Those steps still resound in my ears ; they resound to eternity . If I think of the future and if I remember the past . <p> I wander through the wood . It is getting dark . My brothers are gone . My mother invited my aunt to stay with her . Leaves are rustling . The path is white . The lamps are shining . Stars are emerging in the sky . I search for forgetfulness and a synthesis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my senses , through my disappointed youth , and I think of Anka . I go to the brothel again . Again I get color in my cheeks , I come to life and become stronger . Synthesis is in forgetfulness . <p> Forgetfulness is in passion . <p> I 'm holding Zora and in my fervor I pretend to be holding Anka . No , tonight I am not going home . My house is here , where there are no considerations , no uneasiness and bad conscience . My body is flourishing . My energy solidifying . My ego synthesizing . It only costs ten crowns , but is worth the whole dowry and beauty of my beloved . <p> No , I 'm not going home . <p> Seven in the morning . My knees are giving in . My youth is dying . I 'll sleep like the dead . Sleep too is both forgetfulness and synthesis . The red and rising morning sun reflects off me just like the setting sun reflected the lighted death candles off the window . <p> I had a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longer . All my youth shall pass in forgetfulness , passion and sleep ; and if I grow old , I shall give advice to my children . <p>
