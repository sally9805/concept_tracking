Section : Case Study Emerald Dunes is one of the country 's top public golf courses . It took high-tech management and marketing systems to get it there <p> You 've just boomed a 250-yard drive down the right center of the fairway on number 9 , nicknamed the Green Monster , the prime handicap hole at Emerald Dunes . A birdie 3 would give you a 41 for the front nine and a shot at breaking 80 on this top-ranked , Tom Fazio-designed course . Alas , the hole plays 420 yards from the blue tees , and there 's water all down the right side . Time for a bit of heavenly help . <p> You park your golf cart beside your ball , but instead of stepping off seven paces forward to the 150-yard marker , mentally computing your distance ( to the center of the green ) as 170 yards , and reaching for your 5-iron , as you would at other courses , you consult your electronic caddie . Suspended from the roof of your cart is a small color screen linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diagram of the Green Monster shows not only how far you 've driven but how far to the flagstick : 153 yards . Push a button , and you superimpose a close-up view of the putting surface , which informs you that the pin is on the right front , where the green slopes back to front . You select a 7-iron and swing confidently . Your ball lands just in front of the green and rolls to within three feet of the cup . Hello , birdie putt . <p> What sounds like a golfer 's wild fantasy is everyday reality at six-year-old Emerald Dunes , in West Palm Beach , Fla. , where the satellite-aided 7-iron , courtesy of a product called Prolink ( from Leading Edge Technologies Inc. ) , is just one of many high-tech advantages that are par for the course . Emerald Dunes is one of the most technologically advanced links in the country . " Many golfers tell us they 've played their career round here , " says president Ray Finch , flashing the smile of a 5-handicap golfer . <p> Finch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank Emerald Dunes among the nation 's top public golf courses  --  precisely the Charleston , S.C. , native 's goal when he flew to Palm Beach in the late 1980s to scout sites for a high-end course that would offer a top-quality golf experience from bag drop to the 19th hole . And an essential part of what makes Emerald Dunes a jewel of a place to play a round is Finch 's decisive measures in making the course a showcase of technology-driven management and marketing . The duffer and the scratch player alike can appreciate the features and conveniences that help Emerald Dunes outshine your average links : a state-of-the-art automated reservation system that guarantees prompt bookings and precise tee times , a computer tracking system that helps keep play well paced , a space-age electronic caddie in every golf cart . But it takes an entrepreneur with an eye for the cutting edge to savor the beauty of the computer-driven realm Finch commands behind the scenes , a system that allows him to deliver premium satisfaction to his customers and corporate clients while at the same time giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the start it was Finch 's vision to create a world-class golf course in West Palm Beach that would draw the bulk of its business from nearby luxury hotels like the Breakers ; the Ritz-Carlton , Palm Beach ; and the Four Seasons Resort , Palm Beach . Naturally that meant matching the exemplary service of those four-star resorts so that the hotels would promote the course when booking their corporate packages . Retaining the highly regarded Tom Fazio to design Emerald Dunes earned Finch some necessary cachet , and the course 's glitz factor shot up notably with the quarter-million dollars more that went into the creative earth moving and landscaping that fashioned its signature Superdune , a 50-foot-high tee complete with roaring waterfalls . Finch readily admits , however , that his best investments have been in high tech . <p> " Ray is fearless , " says Neil Haynie , president of Computer Golf Software Inc. , of Boca Raton , Fla . " He 's a good client , a laboratory . The excellence of his golf course is proof he 's been right on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was to his company that Ray Finch turned early on , in search of an automated system that would help him cut costs and run a leaner operation . Computer Golf Software had just the ticket : a soup-to-nuts software package of its own design that enables golf-course managers to generate daily revenue reports , compile point-of-sale data , streamline billing and accounting procedures , and monitor inventory . The package has a comprehensive event-management component , and it also offers regular players the benefits and convenience of an all-hours automated reservation system called Teletee . The tab ? Finch says he spent about $75,000 on his comprehensive Computer Golf system , though Haynie points out that Emerald Dunes elected to purchase more hardware than most other courses . Installation costs for similar systems , Haynie says , usually break down to $25,000 for software , another $25,000 for hardware and wiring , and $10,000 for Teletee . Ongoing fees run about 10% of the software price a year and include two hours of telephone tech support monthly and an annual system update . <p> Teletee began paying dividends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his first visit to the West Palm Beach area he could n't find a single public course that took reservations . " You had to stand in line , put your ball in a hopper , and wait for it to come down , " he says . At Emerald Dunes there are no lines and no low-tech contraptions . Instead , golfers armed with a password can dial the course around the clock from a Touch-Tone phone and reserve tee times up to six days in advance . Acknowledging all confirmed requests is the sweet whooshing sound of a monster tee shot . ( Requests for tee times also can be made by E-mail . ) <p> It 's a far cry from the scenario at most public links , where you still find pro-shop attendants penciling in foursomes in a daily ledger next to the cash register . And with its networked computers , Emerald Dunes can also respond more efficiently and resourcefully to the inevitable scheduling snafus that can be the bane of an otherwise well managed course . Club manager Paul Makris , who 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the date in question , check on availability , and reserve a block of time for 144 golfers two or three years down the road in a matter of seconds , without leaving his desk . While still on the phone , be it with a hotel recreation director or a corporate reservations agent with a major travel agency , he can enter the necessary contract information . " Within five minutes of hanging up , the contract is printed and in the fax machine , " he says . <p> That kind of prompt , reliable service produces peace of mind for the fast-lane corporate clientele that books outings at Emerald Dunes , thus helping to solidify a key segment of its business . Of the 48,000 rounds that will be played at Finch 's course this year , groups will account for about 40% . Says Marcia Mollere , director of sales and marketing for the Ritz-Carlton , Palm Beach , " Emerald Dunes is able to give you a higher level of service because of its systems . " The event-management software easily accommodates last-minute additions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , when a CEO decides to pick up the tab for a beverage cart and 19th-hole libations ) . It even generates scorecards and follow-up thank-you letters to tournament groups and organizers . Backed by that kind of electronic support , Makris manages all events virtually on his own . <p> " Technology has taken away much of the grunt work , enabling us to interact more with our guests , " says Finch , who 's quick to emphasize that running a golf course is a people business . He also credits technology with " helping us act instead of react . In our staff meetings we 're not putting out fires , we 're thinking about the future and where we need to be with our marketing . " <p> Case in point : In June Finch made a last-minute decision to run newspaper ads and local TV spots during the U.S. Open Golf Tournament to promote special off-season summer rates ( $55 on weekends , $45 on weekdays , down from $75 and $65 ) . He 'd noticed a softening of business while studying his computer-generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Neil Haynie during their initial negotiations . If , like most operators , Finch had waited to read a monthly report , he 'd have missed the U.S. Open TV audience and gotten a later start on his more aggressive pricing . It was an example of just-in-time marketing that boosted rounds by 28% the following week . <p> Tee times are like airline seats  --  you fill ' em or lose ' em . " Our inventory is actually little chunks of time , " says Finch , explaining that he can easily lose up to 10% of that inventory by failing to note a busy day in need of double-teeing , that is , starting foursomes off holes 1 and 10 simultaneously for two hours . " Our Computer Golf software tells me how best to utilize our time . " <p> Even so , it 's not a panacea . Until recently , Finch , like nearly every course operator in the United States , had his own Green Monster to tame : slow play , which backed up foursomes like rush-hour traffic . Five-hour rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking oversized bites out of Emerald Dunes ' perishable " inventory . " So when Leading Edge Technologies , of Chandler , Ariz. , knocked on his door to demonstrate its satellite-guided Prolink system , the first words out of Finch 's mouth were , " Where have you guys been ? " He 'd been waiting for one of a dozen companies to successfully adapt the military 's global positioning system ( GPS ) of earth-orbiting satellites to tracking golf carts on fairways . Here at last , Finch figured , was the missing piece in his business puzzle . <p> So far he seems to have figured right . The beauty of this particular commercialization of satellite technology is that it offers a win-win situation . Thanks to its appealing stroke-saving features , golfers hardly notice the system 's Big Brother-like surveillance : a computer screen in the pro shop that allows the head pro to monitor every color-coded cart on a map of the course . White indicates a cart that 's ahead of the target time ( four hours and 12 minutes ) ; yellow shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should a foursome be holding up others behind them , software built into the system lets the pro shop send a canned message : " Please maintain pace with your Prolink timer . " A staffer in the shop can also type in a special message . Golfers receiving a message either press a button acknowledging it or stare at a blank , disabled screen . Acknowledge they do  --  and generally pick up the pace . For most players the electronic nudge is preferable to getting flagged down by the dreaded course ranger , which is usually about as pleasant as being pulled over by the highway patrol . <p> Play also quickens because golfers no longer have to pace off distances from 150- or 200-yard markers . Since its debut at Emerald Dunes last December , Prolink has helped trim 20 minutes off the average round , which now lasts just over four hours . And time is money . Many days , that **25;3775;TOOLONG saving helps Emerald Dunes schedule a couple more tee times . At more than $500 a foursome in season , the money adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in season , the system often helps squeeze in walk-ons , golfers who drive up to the bag drop without reservations . A year ago they invariably would have been told , " Sorry , guys . " Now , if a quick glance at the pro-shop computer screen reveals a one-hole gap on the course , they 're likely to hear , " Do you mind starting on number 5 ? " In most cases the group is positively grateful . " We 've got four people who think we 've done something special for them , " says Finch . " And we did n't have to say no to $750 " ( the amount many foursomes spend on greens fees , food , and pro-shop items ) . <p> Even more important , stresses Finch , " we no longer have those disaster days . We can now react quicker , so that maybe only a single group is temporarily inconvenienced . At one time , six holes might have been held up before we realized we had a problem . " And that was with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finch has reduced the hours of three rangers  --  saving a portion of their salaries . Moreover , with the system providing hole-by-hole diagrams as well as tips on how best to play each hole , Emerald Dunes no longer has to print low-tech booklets that do the same . Annual savings : $30,000 . <p> Already Prolink just about pays its way . Finch 's annual Prolink lease comes to less than $2 per cart per round , $90,000 for 48,000 rounds . Soon the system should be spinning off profits . Because Finch was confident that Prolink 's glitzy golfer-friendly features were amenities he could mark up , he 's boosted in-season greens fees to $135 . And just around the corner lies the prospect of advertising revenues . Ads for local businesses and golf products currently appear on the cart screens between holes . Finch collects about $13 a day per advertiser . " This is very targeted , rifle-shot demographics  --  people paying $100-plus for greens fees . And your ad is delivered in a positive environment , " Finch says . He adds that as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , it will begin selling national advertising , guaranteeing something on the order of 2 million " impressions " a year to advertisers . Profits from the ad sales will be split with Leading Edge 's partner courses . <p> Still brainstorming , Finch anticipates additional wide-ranging benefits from his satellite-aided cart system that could do wonders for his bottom line . For example , he might try to negotiate better terms with his cart-leasing company by demonstrating that Prolink 's tighter monitoring of vehicle usage distributes rounds  --  and wear and tear  --  more equally through his 80-cart fleet , protecting the fleet 's resale value . Or he might push for lower insurance rates , now that Prolink lets him flash an all-carts warning message when lightning poses a threat . <p> Above all , the new GPS-based technology helps satisfy Finch 's long-standing and heretofore unrequited craving for control . " Our inventory is spread out over 250 acres . You basically give a player a cart and say , ' See you in four to five hours . ' Now we can make intelligent decisions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , " he stresses . " That 's a control element that 's never been available to this industry before . " <p> A typical day at the course finds Finch keeping a close eye on the screen of a laptop while working at his desk . The screen displays the same cart-tracking map as the pro shop 's computers , allowing him at any given moment to get a snapshot of how his course is playing and being managed . That capability to look in from afar and keep tabs behind the scenes is the key to his future plans . Emerald Dunes , he realizes , is fast reaching its maximum profit levels . Gross revenues have risen steadily , from $1.7 million in 1990 to projected revenues of $4.8 million this year . The course 's revenues should soon reach $6 million to $7 million  --  more than five times the annual receipts of the typical family-owned public course  --  and should then level off . Those estimates are based on an ultimate target of scheduling approximately 50,000 rounds a year , which is about as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the course and creating logjams . <p> To continue to grow beyond that point , Finch will have to add more courses . Initial plans call for a handful of courses geographically close enough to share fixed overhead costs as well as expensive caretaking equipment  --  a $30,000 aerator , for example . Eventually , who knows ? Golf is one of the few remaining industries still dominated by mom-and-pop operations , and Finch thinks it 's a business ripe for consolidation . He believes that with a helping hand from Prolink , there 's no reason he ca n't operate a string of courses from a distance . Not long ago he proved it , peeking in on Emerald Dunes from some 35,000 feet above Atlanta , using the **25;3802;TOOLONG telephone connection for his laptop modem . <p> High technology , indeed . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Golf Pros : Atop Superdunes ' president Ray Finch ( in Cart ) and friends , enjoying a round <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : You Are Here : Ray Finch and satellite-tracked cart <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one monitor and local weather on the other <p> By Grossman , John <p> <p> John Grossmann is editor and publisher of NewsReach , a monthly small-business newsletter , based in Jamison , Pa . <p>
