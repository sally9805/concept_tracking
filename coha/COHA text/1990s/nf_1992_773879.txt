txt // Rollins ( " Airegin " ) , another by Swing altoist Benny Carter ( " When Lights Are Low " ) , and the Richard Rodgers ballad " My Funny Valentine . " The feeling on Cookin ' is far more spontaneous than on Further Explorations . There are no secondary themes , and the whole formal framework suggests a " blowing session " rather than the kind of careful preparation evident on the Silver LP . Yet if a " blowing session " implies musicians unfamiliar with one another 's work , then Cookin ' is anything but ! For one thing , Garland , Chambers , and Jones comprised one of the most cohesive rhythm sections in the history of jazz , a trio closely attuned to each other and to Davis and Coltrane . In addition , as Joe Goldberg observed : " At least part of the unique quality of the quintet performances lay in a particular principle which Davis grasped , a principle so simple that it apparently eluded everyone else . To put it in terms of this particular group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be a quartet featuring Miles , and , at different times on the same tune , it could be a quartet featuring Coltrane or a trio featuring either Garland or Chambers . The Davis rhythm section , Jones in particular , was well aware of this , and gave each of the three principal soloists his own best backing . Behind Davis , the rhythm was full of space , with few chords ; behind Coltrane , it was compulsive ; and with Garland , it lapsed into an easy , Ahmad Jamal like feeling . " 4 Finally , a few timbral devices ? Garland 's use of block chords in the style of Ahmad Jamal or Erroll Garner , Chambers 's bowed solos , and Davis 's mute-inmicrophone approach to ballads ? added textural variety . Davis 's ballads enabled him to reach an audience far broader than jazz aficionados and made him in a sense the greatest jazz torch singer since Billie Holiday . Playing the microphone as much as his horn , he produced a sound , quivery and haunting , charged with restrained passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other tunes , he also makes the most of his sound , which seems to contain depths and nuances lacking in other trumpeters . At times jauntily ironic , at times // playing in a hoarsely anguished whisper , Davis creates a set of solos in which silence , used for dramatic impact , punctuates striking figures from which all extraneous embellishments have been burned away . This is particularly true on the medium-tempo " Blues by Five , " but even on up-tempo numbers Davis refuses to be hurried and sometimes slows his own tempo to half that of the rest of the quintet . Coltrane , who to some critics seemed to sort so ill with Davis , was in fact the trumpeter 's ideal foil . Over a more volcanic Philly Joe , he unleashes a firestorm of convoluted phrases that alternate with simpler gutbucket figures ( Coltrane had paid extensive " dues " in R &; B bands , including Daisy May and the Hep Cats and King Kolax 's combo ) , piercing cries , and melodic fragments tumbling over each other as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As fiery as Davis is severe , Coltrane strains against bar lines and chord changes . The contrast between the two is crucial to the group 's impact . Nearly as important , however , are Chambers 's dark , woody sound and choice notes and Philly Joe 's volatile , double-jointed rhythmic sense . Speaking of the drummer , whose life was even more disordered than usual for a jazz musician of the era , Davis told Nat Hentoff : " Look , I would n't care if he came up on the bandstand in his B.V.D.s and with one arm , just so long as he was there . He 's got the fire I want . There 's nothing more terrible than playing with a dull rhythm section . Jazz has got to have that thing . You have to be born with it . You ca n't even buy it . If you could buy it , they 'd have it at the next Newport festival . " 5 Davis 's and Silver 's quintets were perhaps the two most influential hard-bop bands of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw attention to themselves on this count ( certainly no one would confuse them with any earlier style of jazz ) , they both embodied and created the hip sound of urban America . Mainstream hard bop , however , consisted of far more than its " stars " and by 1958 was the common currency of virtually all gifted black // musicians . Among these were pianists Wynton Kelly , Elmo Hope , and Sonny Clark . None was enormously successful in a commercial sense , but their lives and music embody hard bop 's underside : a penumbral world where most of the era 's best jazzmen suffered and created . Scufflin ' : Three Pianists Born in Jamaica , Wynton Kelly ( 1931 ? 1971 ) came to the United States at the age of four and grew up in Brooklyn . He made his professional debut in 1943 , and two years later he toured the Caribbean with Ray Abrams 's combo . Gigs with bands somewhere between jazz and R &; B followed , and in the early fifties Kelly also worked and recorded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.J. Johnson . His first LP as a leader , never reissued , was a ten-inch trio date for Blue Note . In the mid-fifties , he spent three years as Dinah Washington 's accompanist , and it was during this period that he began to establish himself as an unusually engaging , light-fingered stylist as well as ( in record producer Orrin Keepnews 's words ) " possibly the finest jazz accompanist of our day . " 6 In the late fifties and early sixties , Kelly seems to have recorded with virtually every major jazz soloist : John Col trane , Sonny Rollins , guitarist Wes Montgomery , Jimmy Heath , Johnny Griffin , and a host of others , including Miles Davis , with whom he spent the years between 1959 and 1963 , replacing Red Garland in Miles 's band . In the course of the same period , Kelly recorded several albums as a leader for Riverside and Vee Jay . After leaving Miles in 1963 , the pianist formed a trio with two other Davis alumni : Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb , cohorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most swinging rhythm section . Wes Montgomery later joined the unit for concert and club appearances , some of which were recorded by Verve Records . Throughout these years , Kelly 's ebullience , phenomenal swing , and deep empathy with the blues ( which earned him // the invitation to sit in on " Freddie Freeloader " for Davis 's Kind of Blue album ) made him a favorite with other musicians . Yet Kelly seemed unable to escape the typecast role of sideman . Bill Evans 's admiring words , quoted in Leonard Feather 's and Ira Gitler 's Encyclopedia of Jazz in the 1970s , express an appreciation that Kelly only rarely won outside an inner circle of his peers : " When I heard him in Dizzy 's big band , the whole thing was so joyful and exuberant ; nothing about it seemed calculated . And yet , with the clarity of the way he played , you know he had to put this together in a very carefully planned way ? but the result was completely without calculation , there was just a pure shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent casualness , as if swinging , joyously expressive music came as naturally as breathing , that kept Kelly from the forefront of most listeners ' awareness . A heavy drinker for years , he died in Toronto , apparently of an epileptic seizure . Full View , an LP recorded for the Milestone label with bassist Ron McClure and Jimmy Cobb , was Wynton Kelly 's last record as a leader and offers ample opportunity to savor the many graces of his style . The tempos range from slow to medium-up , thus ensuring more swing than technical fireworks ? and swing Kelly does , with all the resources in his varied repertoire . The most potent of these , perhaps , is a penchant for lagging slightly behind the beat , especially toward the end of one of those cascading phrases that were his forte . Such figures spiral unevenly downward , their fall broken by occasional upward flights , gathering power toward the end through the delayed rhythm and resultant tension between piano and drums . Though Kelly 's lines frequently alternate with block chords and funky octave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chords in the manner of many Garland- and Garner-influenced pianists . Instead , Kelly keeps his music bubbling through fine tunings of time and attack and can make a series of eighth notes jump as few other pianists could have done . // The repertoire on Full View also reflects Kelly 's closeness to popular music , especially in the torch songs ( " Born to Be Blue " and " What a Difference a Day Makes , " the latter a tune Kelly frequently played with Dinah Washington ) and blues pieces ( " Scufflin " ' and " Dont'cha Hear Me Callin ' to Ya , " both with the kind of danceable , forward-leaning beat popularized by such jazz hits as Cannonball Adderley 's " Jive Samba " and Lee Morgan 's " The Sidewinder " ) . The ballads show off Kelly 's adroit pedal work , his silky , caressing touch , and his ability to swing a slow tune without violating its tempo and atmosphere , while the blues reveal the pianist 's sublimely dirty sense of the idiom , as does " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow grind . The medium-tempo pop tunes ( " I Thought " by Rudy Stevenson , " Autumn Leaves , " " On a Clear Day , " and Burt Bacharach 's " Walk on By " ) , however , probably show Kelly in his most characteristic groove : alternately soulful and airy , tipping light and bearing down hard . The whole record , like Kelly 's playing itself , is an object lesson in how to derive maximum rhythmic impetus from an instrument whose tonality is more fixed than any other commonly used in black music . If jazz piano has two sides , an artistically self-conscious one ( Art Tatum , Bud Powell , Andrew Hill , et al. ) and a " lighter " one closer to the perspectives of our best popular music ( Teddy Wilson and Erroll Garner , for example ) , then Kelly is one of the three or four giants within the latter tradition . His techinques and discoveries , however , have been appropriated by almost everyone ? for example , by the " experimentalist " Muhal Richard Abrams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressive charm , Kelly is just about unbeatable , and although in his wake scores of musicians have adopted his methods , Kelly himself still haunts those semi-anonymous catacombs inhabited by the shades of " musicians ' musicians . " Elmo Hope ( 1923-1967 ) , who was christened St. Elmo Sylvester Hope after the patron saint of sailors , grew up in HarA // lem , where he and Bud Powell were close friends . The two young pianists often practiced together and played for each other ? both classical music and jazz ? and Bud introduced Elmo to his friend Thelonious Monk . Bud , of course , went on to become the most widely imitated pianist of the era , while Elmo remained in the shadows , working mostly with R &; B bands , in particular a long ( 1948 ? 1951 ) stint with trumpeter Joe Morris . Not until the fifties did Elmo start recording in a jazz context with Sonny Rollins , Lou Donaldson , Clifford Brown , and Jackie McLean . In addition , he cut two ten-inch LPs for Blue Note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coltrane and Hank Mobley for the same label . None of these achievements , however , won Hope much acclaim , and he was usually thought of ? by those who knew of his existence ? as simply another competent Bud Powell disciple . The problems Hope faced as a heroin addict may also have limited the amount of attention he could devote to his music during this period . All the same , on a tune like " De-Dah , " a Hope original from a Clifford Brown ? Lou Donaldson album on Blue Note , one can already hear many elements of the pianist 's emerging style : somber , internally shifting chords in the introduction ; punchy , twisting phrases in his solo ; and the smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work . In 1957 , after a spell on the road with trumpeter Chet Baker , Hope decided to settle in Los Angeles . The move , however , proved to be a mistake ; and by 1961 , in a Down Beat interview with John Tynan entitled " Bitter Hope , " Elmo advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to learn anything . If they want to learn , let them go back to New York ? both for inspiration and brotherly love . They 'll find more things happening . " 8 Yet the years in California marked a turning point in Elmo 's development . Though generally isolated and denied much chance to record , he made giant strides musically and capped his period in L.A. with two monumental albums for Hifijazz that ensured his place in history . The sides are his own Elmo Hope Trio and Harold Land 's The Fox , on which four of // the six tunes are Elmo 's . The Fox is dominated by his spirit and conception , despite superb performances by the leader , trum-peter Dupree Bolton , bassist Herbie Lewis , and drummer Frank Butler . It was when these albums appeared that jazz critics began to take more notice of Hope . The trio date received five stars , Down Beat 's highest rating , and John Tynan 's review defined " the essence of Hope " as " a sort of bitter-sweet melancholy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other individuals of comparable sensitivity ? who sometimes find the world ' a bit much , ' as the English say , to cope with . " 9 Not long after the interview , and with the encouragement of Riverside Records ' Orrin Keepnews , Elmo decided to take his own advice and return to New York . There he recorded ( in June 1961 ) another major album called Homecoming with trum-peter Blue Mitchell , Jimmy Heath , tenor saxophonist Frank Foster , Percy Heath , and Philly Joe Jones . More records fol-lowed , including a duet session with his wife Bertha and several trio sets , but gigs were hard to come by despite some work with Johnny Griffin . Poor health and drug problems also plagued the pianist in his last years . Another disc , Sounds from Riker 's Island , featured a group entirely composed of junkies and an essay by Nat Hentoff attacking America 's penal ap-proach to narcotics addiction . On May 19 , 1967 , Hope died of pneumonia . Elmo Hope 's reputation as a gifted and tragic figure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hifijazz , now available on Contemporary Records . The LP , on which Elmo is backed by one of California 's fiercest bass and drum duos ( Jimmy Bond and Frank Butler ) , is evenly divided between dark-toned bal-lads ( " Barfly , " " Eejah , " " Like Someone in Love , " and " Tract-quility " ) and jagged medium-up tunes ( " B 's a Plenty , " " Boa , " " Something for Kenny , " and " Minor Bertha " ) . Mostly in the minor mode , Elmo 's compositions are dominated by a sense of urgent musical questing as well as by a feeling of self-exposure far beyond standard jazz postures. // Intentionally or not , Hope 's solos do everything possible to convey these tonalities and to give the impression that noth-ing is being played merely as a lick or to fill up space . Ideas and fragments of ideas abruptly spill over and intersect each other , as if the pianist 's hands could barely keep pace with his emotions . Bars densely packed with runs and baroque filigrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide intervalic leaps , and octaves . Even more than in most modem jazz , melodic units rarely coincide with bar lines , and the sequence of phrases is extremely irregular . Likewise , con-ventional ballads ( such as " Like Someone in Love " ) are also undercut and transformed by unexpected , violent accents . All these elements , taken together , create an effect of con-ventional forms being pushed to their limits under the pres-sure of Hope 's turbulent sensibility . This effect bears a certain resemblance to Andrew Hill 's angry , intellectually explora-tory work in the mid-sixties , but in Elmo 's case molds seem mutilated and broken in a sort of intimate agony . The ballads , of course , with their solemn dignity and nobly " classical " references , convey this sensation especially . Another possible comparison would be with Bud Powell in his later years ? that is , if Powell 's assault on symmetry and flow had produced not incoherent gestures but some musical correlative for life on the brink . Hope 's harmonic imagination is one of the record 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , while the chord patterns ? especially in ballads like " Barfly " ? are fresh and richly textured . Though one can feel the remembered presence of his early musical companions , Elmo possesses his materials absolutely . Indeed , when this record first appeared , some listeners felt that a third great bebop pianist had emerged , after a strangely prolonged incubation , at the very instant when Monk and Powell had lost some of their creative fire . Elmo Hope , at that moment , seemed destined to assume a place among the very finest pianists in jazz history , but he had little chance to build on his achievements . Instead , he left only // a few glimpses with which we may conjure what a full and secure career might have offered . Conrad Yeatis " Sonny " Clark ( 1931 ? 1963 ) was born in Herminie , Pennsylvania , a coal-mining town of some eight hundred inhabitants . At the age of twelve , the pianist moved to Pittsburgh and began playing professionally while he was still attending high school . In 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . After deciding to stay , Sonny began gigging around San Francisco with saxophonists Wardell Gray and Vido Musso , Oscar Pettiford , and Buddy De Franco , with whom he stayed from late 1953 till the beginning of 1956 . Sonny 's next move was down to Los Angeles , where he joined Howard Rumsey 's All Stars at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach . Asked by Leonard Feather to give his impressions of that experience , Sonny replied : " The climate is crazy . I 'm going to be truthful , though : I did have sort of a hard time trying to be comfortable in my playing . The fellows out on the west coast have a different sort of feeling , a different approach to jazz . They swing in their own way . But drummer Stan Levey , trombonist Frank Rosolino and trumpeter Conte Candoli were a very big help ; of course they all worked back in the east for a long time during the early part of their careers . . . The eastern musicians play with so much fire and passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own advice and headed for New York , accompanying Dinah Washington along the way " more or less for the ride . " Once there , he began to record for Blue Note ( four albums : Dial S for Sonny , Sonny 's Crib , Sonny Clark Trio , and Cool Struttin ' ) and was frequently in clubs and on record sessions with the likes of Stan Getz , Sonny Rollins , Charles Mingus , Clifford Jordan , and Johnny Griffin . The personnel from his own Blue Note sides in the late fifties ( including Art Farmer , Donald Byrd , Jackie McLean , John Coltrane , Paul Chambers , Philly Joe Jones , Louis Hayes , and Art Taylor ) reads like a Who 's Who of the New York hard-bop scene in that period . // Although this flurry of activity produced results of varying quality , within a few years Clark had evolved into one of jazz 's best pianists . After a brief hiatus in the late fifties , he cut an album ( Max Roach/George Duvivier/Sonny Clark , later reissued on the Bainbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand comparison with even the quickestburning bebop torches . During the early sixties , Sonny also recorded with such Blue Note regulars as Jackie McLean and Dexter Gordon , both of whom he matched in fluency and passion . In 1961 , the pianist made another album for Blue Note , by far his best on that label and also , as it happened , his last : Leapin ' and Lopin ' . Less eccentric than Hope but without Kelly 's popular , letthe-good-times-roll approach , Sonny Clark never had much trouble finding work . He was one of many musicians encouraged and supported by Blue Note 's discerning musical director Alfred Lion ; yet , like Kelly and Hope , he was little known outside of jazz 's inner coteries . His difficulties in reaching a wider audience were compounded by narcotics addiction , and late in 1962 he was hospitalized after a heart attack . Released in early January 1963 , he played his last gig at a New York club called Junior 's , where he died of an overdose in the early hours of January 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license , the owners moved his corpse to a private apartment before calling the police . Bill Evans , who acknowledged his influence and shared both his " problem " and his long-lined , sinuous pianistic approach , dedicated the tune " N.Y.C. 's No Lark " ( an anagram of Clark 's name ) to his late friend . Though more conventional than Hope 's , Sonny Clark 's style also seemed to imply great things to come . On the back of his Cool Struttin ' album ( Blue Note ) , the pianist praises Lennie Tristano 's " technical ability and conception , " and the debt to Tristano is clear on Max Roach/George Duvivier/Sonny Clark . But it is a mixed debt , for Clark 's playing seems at first hearing to be so firmly rooted in the Powell tradition that one // is hardly prepared to detect Tristano as his second guiding spirit . The link with Tristano ( though also with Powell ) is most evident in Sonny Clark 's snaking melodic lines . These lines , which can extend for several bars at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the essence of Clark 's style and his dominant musical mode . The intensity generated by this onrush of ideas , pouring forth in rapid succession as the long phrases build toward delayed climaxes or , at times , multiple internal ones , lends an air of concentrated taking-care-of-business to the side . Clark 's other major influence , however , is Horace Silver , and nearly every cut on this trio set includes at least one bow in the funkmaster 's direction ? usually in the form of one of his pet phrases . Laced through intricate multi-bar lines but often increasing in frequency as the solo approaches its climax , these phrases turn into another element of surprise within the otherwise unremitting context . They seem to ground Clark 's music in the popular tradition , while making few concessions to it and maintaining an atmosphere of charged lucidity quite different from Silver 's more relaxed effects . The record is entirely devoted to Clark originals ( mostly medium to medium-up blues or variations on standard chord changes ) , whose themes tend to be functional . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or octave ? are used in the right hand , and the emphasis is almost exclusively on single-note lines . One exception , however , is " My Conception , " an unaccompanied ballad played mostly out of tempo , with the slightest hint of stride in the last chorus . Here Clark 's appreciation of Art Tatum 's lush virtuosity is expressed in meditative clusters of runs , embellishments , and two-handed , contrapuntal figures . Rhythmically , on most numbers Clark tends to push the beat for an effect of urgency , rather than retard it for a laid-back groove as Kelly would have done . Clark 's staccato attack fits in well with the serpentine structurings he favored , and his // playing makes one feel that all the bebop and blues vocabulary ever required was musicians who employed it with sufficient conviction . Clark seemed to be such a musician , and many expected great things from him : a career in which the record with Roach and Duvivier would merely be the opening statement , showing he had assimilated his sources and was ready to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never occurred , nor did Kelly and Hope reach the sort of public they deserved . Jazz has always been a minority taste , and few listeners have been able to keep more than a dozen names in their minds simultaneously . Critics , also , have often had an overly schematic approach to the music , devoting attention to those they deem major innovators at the expense of equally talented musicians whose individuality is expressed in subtler ways . ( The amount of ink expended on Lester Young , as opposed to Ben Webster , is a good example of this phenomenon . ) Such an approach has been particularly unfortunate when applied to hard bop and to Dance 's Mainstream . Like the style Dance championed , hard bop was " a vast body of music . " Part of its richness ? and part of the reason so many hard-bop record dates are being reissued today ? is the school 's extraordinary depth and range of figures . That , of course , was what made it " mainstream " : almost everyone good was playing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jazz ceased to be " popular music " with the arrival of bebop in the mid-1940s . While this assumption is partly true , it also requires a good deal of qualification . Jazz , like blues , remained economically viable in black neighborhoods until driven out by the pop sounds of the late 1960s . That jazz ( with the exception of the " cool " style played by Stan Getz , Gerry Mulligan , and others ) had a primarily black audience is confirmed by Joe Fields , currently with Muse Records and formerly employed by Prestige and Columbia : " Our records sold to some white college kids , but our sales at Prestige were overwhelmingly to blacks ? not just tenor and organ stuff but hard bop too . That 's why what we sold in Boston was nothing compared to Chicago , St. Louis , Cleveland . . . Our sales in Los Angeles were much better than in San Francisco . " To understand this world is also to understand why , although jazz is currently enjoying one of its periods of greatest popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music has been reduced to a trickle . From 1945 to 1965 , jazz attracted the ghetto 's most gifted young musicians . 62 // During the late 1950s and early 1960s , hard bop was the basic idiom in the neighborhoods where such youngsters lived . Less intellectual and less technically dazzling than bebop before it , hard bop was also more open to the black popular tradition ? especially blues and gospel . Hard bop was expressive . It was sometimes bleak , often tormented , but always cathartic ; and it was " bad " ( sinister , menacing ) in the sense that James Brown was " bad . " In 1959 , virtually every apartment building in areas like Harlem or the South Side of Chicago housed at least a few knowledgeable , serious jazz fans . Their historical awareness might not have extended very far back before the arrival of bebop , but they could eloquently debate the relative merits of tenor , saxophonists like Harold Land and Booker Ervin or pianists like Bobby Timmons and Kenny Drew . Such fans usually had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Little Walter , but the quality of their interest was often different . They tended to be aficionados rather than casual listeners , and they thought of jazz as both " art " ( in the Western sense of the term ) and background music for partying , rather than as exclusively the latter . Bars , of course , were crucial points of exposure to jazz , both live and on jukeboxes . Particularly common in ghettos ? especially after Jimmy Smith hit the scene in the mid-fiftieswere " soul jazz " combos featuring the likes of Lou Donaldson , Willis " Gator Tail " Jackson , Eddie " Lockjaw " Davis , Brother Jack McDuff , Jimmy McGriff , and Shirley Scott , as well as pianists like Ramsey Lewis , Gene Harris ( of the Three Sounds ) , Red Garland , and Les McCann . In midwestern clubs ( Manhattan below 96th Street was already in a more racially mixed , sophisticated class by itself in regard to live jazz ) , groups of this kind performed as often as " hard core " jazz combos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Horace Silver . Many bands were composed of local musicians who never achieved national recognition . As with salsa in the early 1990s , jazz in the 1950s was a good way to make a living and a // lousy way to get rich . The concentration of independent labels in New York ( Blue Note , Prestige , Riverside , and Savoy were the big four ) also made it difficult for musicians to get a hearing elsewhere and acted as a magnet , sucking young jazzmen out of cities like Detroit and Philadelphia that had no recording industries to speak of . A look at the jazz labels ' singles lists reveals much about black taste during this period . Blue Note and Prestige each issued approximately three hundred 45-rpm singles between 1955 and 1970 . Though both lists were stylistically broad , the tendency was definitely toward " listenable " and/or funky sounds : in other words , ballads and groove numbers . Blue Note leaned heavily toward the kind of playing done by the Three Sounds and by organists Big John Patton , Freddie Roach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burrell and Grant Green ; saxophonists Lou Donaldson , Ike Quebec , and Stanley Turrentine ; and trombonist Bennie Green . In second place were singles by hard-bop " stars " like Cannonball Adderley , Blakey , Silver , and Sonny Rollins . Musicians like Jackie McLean and vibist Bobby Hutcherson were far less generously represented ( in McLean 's case , for example , by " Greasy " from New Soil , and in Hutcherson 's by " Ummh , " from San Francisco ) . Both " Greasy " and " Ummh " are blues , " Greasy " being a kind of modified boogie-woogie and " Ummh " a slow grind with a heavy back beat . Still other artists , like Andrew Hill , were apparently judged too cerebral , even at their funkiest , to merit single releases . The Prestige catalogue tells much the same story , but in a more extreme way . Bob Weinstock , who ran Prestige , was less committed to jazz as an " art form " than Blue Note 's Alfred Lion and Frank Woolf . One result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly the whole show : pianists Red Garland and Bobby Timmons ; organists Charles Earland , Richard " Groove " Holmes , Jack McDuff , Freddie Roach , Shirley Scott , Johnny " Hammond " Smith , and Larry Young ; saxophonists Gene Ammons , Arnett Cobb , // Lockjaw Davis , Jimmy Forrest , Red Holloway , Gator Tail Jackson , and Houston Person ; and guitarist Kenny Burrell , plus a very modest admixture of Miles Davis , John Coltrane , and the like . In considering both lists , however , we should bear in mind that soul jazz musicians on the order of Gene Ammons , Kenny Burrell , and Jimmy Smith were outstanding jazzmen and that such others as Houston Person , Lockjaw Davis , and Ike Quebec were also very good indeed . Moreover , though for some musicians ( like Gator Tail Jackson ) soul jazz was the only context in which they felt comfortable , others ( like Larry Young ) could play demanding music ( for example Unity on Blue Note ) of great subtlety , attuned to a far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although " groove numbers " were certainly the type most likely to end up on single releases , virtually all black musicians regarded them as simply one element of a varied repertoire . According to Michael Cuscuna , arguably the world 's leading authority on Blue Note and currently in charge of CapitolEMI 's Blue Note reissue program , the average sales for the company 's singles were three thousand to jukebox operators , plus another thousand or so to individuals in black neighborhoods. jukeboxes , in the 1950s and 1960s , were almost as important a means of exposure as radio . Joe Fields adds that singles ( some of them truncated versions of tunes issued on LP in their complete form ? for example , Cannonball Adderley 's " Jive Samba , " put out by Riverside in 1963 ) were sent out to black radio stations . Like virtually every other aspect of the music business , including distributors , record stores , and the companies themselves , black radio was then very different from what it is today . The voices of jazz dj 's like Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of America 's ghettos . Critic and musician Mark C. Gridley 's comments on his early exposure to jazz give something of the flavor of radio fare at the time : " Growing up in Detroit , I heard hard bop more than any other style . In fact , during the early // 1960s there was a radio station in Detroit that played almost nothing but hard bop . After arranging my high school and work schedules to enable me to hear as much of it as possible , I soon found that I could distinguish the sounds of Freddie Hubbard from Lee Morgan , Barry Harris from Tommy Flanagan , the Horace Silver Quintet from Art Blakey 's Jazz Messengers , etc . So , even though my first jazz albums had been Duke Ellington reissues , I soon became very comfortable with hard bop , as well . ( Eventually I managed to develop a tone quality in my tenor saxophone playing that resembled Joe Henderson's. ) " 1 How did jazz sell between 1950 and 1965 ? This question is not as easily answered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to accumulate over decades , not weeks . Thus , John Coltrane 's A Love Supreme , one of the most popular jazz LPs ever with estimated sales of half a million , does not figure in Billboard 's lists of the Top 200 LPs between 1945 and 1972 . Likewise , we find no Miles Davis records at all in Billboard 's listings before 1962 , though by 1960 Miles possessed a townhouse in Manhattan , drove an expensive sports car , and dressed in custom-tailored Italian suits . Nonetheless , Billboard 's charts ? both for LPs and for R &; B singles ? are worth examining . What we find , first of all , is that singles by Swing musicians ( for instance Ella Fitzgerald 's " Smooth Sailing , " Lionel Hampton 's " Rag Mop , " and Johnny Hodges 's " Castle Rock " ) still enjoyed brisk sales in the ghetto at the beginning of the 1950s . Modem jazz , no matter how much one stretches the term , is represented by only two entries during this period : King Pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mood for Love " and Gene Ammons 's " Red Top . " In addition , we find sides on the borderline between jazz and R &; B ( what would later be dubbed " soul jazz " ) like Illinois Jacquet 's " Port of Rico " and Jimmy Forrest 's " Night Train . " Very little jazz reached the R &; B charts between 1953 and 1960 , when jazz singles again began to appear there regularly . The reasons are diverse , but one of them is certainly that as // Swing began to sound old-fashioned to blacks and as bebop ? never the stuff of jukebox hits ? played itself out , the audience for jazz singles disintegrated . Meanwhile , however , a new generation of musicians returned to black music 's popular roots . These musicians , in turn , made jazz more appealing to black listeners , who in the early 1960s responded by purchasing a new crop of hits . Some best-sellers of the period were Cannonball Adderley 's " African Waltz , " Ray Bryant 's " Little Susie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Misty , " Ramsey Lewis 's " The In Crowd , " Gloria Lynne 's version of Herbie Hancock 's " Watermelon Man , " Jimmy McGriff 's rendition of Ray Charles 's " I Got a Woman , " Jimmy Smith 's " Midnight Special , " and Nancy Wilson 's and Cannonball Adderley 's " Save Your Love for Me . " In all these cases , what we see is not so much popularity among jazz fans as crossover into R &; B territory . Horace Silver , for instance ? one of the era 's biggest sellers on LP ? is unrepresented , despite his numerous singles on Blue Note . Nonetheless , it was Silver and other prominent hard boppers who had created the atmosphere for such hit-makers , returning jazz to the hot , danceable rhythms and funky-butt emotions it had strayed from during the bebop era . Billboard 's top LP listings ( not specifically R &; B ) also include a certain amount of jazz . As might be expected , hard bop and soul jazz predominate , though some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the R &; B charts , reflecting ( among other things ) the fact that jazz fans tend to buy LPs . Some serious jazz sides that made the Top 200 between 1960 and 1966 were Cannonball Adderley 's Jazz Workshop Revisited ; Gene Ammons 's Bad Bossa Nova ; Kenny Burrell 's The Tender Gender ; Blue Bash , featuring Burrell and Jimmy Smith ; Miles Davis 's Someday My Prince Will Come and Seven Steps to Heaven ; Lou Donaldson 's Alligator Boogaloo ; Groove Holmes 's Soul Message ; Gloria Lynne 's I 'm Glad There Is You ; Jack McDuff 's Live ! ; Thelonious Monk 's Criss Cross ; Lee Morgan 's The Side68 HARD B o p winder ; Horace Silver 's Song for My Father ; six Jimmy Smith sides on Blue Note , the most successful being Back at the Chicken Shack ; and Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley . Such LP charts , like the R &; B listings , reflect a combination of weekly sales , airplay , and , in some cases , the clout of record companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independent jazz labels , this pressure was felt negatively . Blue Note , for example , never advertised in industry publications . According to Cuscuna 's recollections , the label 's all-time best-sellers were Lee Morgan 's The Sidewinder , Horace Silver 's Song for My Father , and Lou Donaldson 's Alligator Boogaloo , all of which figured in Billboard 's charts and sold something like a hundred thousand copies apiece over several years . Another big seller was Herbie Hancock 's Maiden Voyage , which must have been slower to take off since it never made the charts . Like the title cut from The Sidewinder , used as background music for a Chrysler television spot , " Maiden Voyage " figured in a Faberge commercial and , in fact , was listed on the master tape simply as " TV Jingle " and only christened later by Jean Hancock , Herbie 's sister . Average initial sales for more straight-ahead hard-bop LPs like Jackie McLean 's New Soil , again according to Cuscuna , ran from 6000 to 8000 copies , the break-even mark being about 2500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in print and selling well . The world that generated them , however , has vanished into history books and recollections . I myself was lucky enough to experience the last few years of that world , and I can recall those glorious jukeboxes where Jimmy Smith , Miles Davis , and Cannonball Adderley rubbed shoulders with Martha Reeves , the Impressions , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf . The pervasiveness of jazz in the ghetto can be seen in the work of many R &; B musicians formed during the 1960s ? for example , that of the instrumentalists featured with Kool and the Gang or with Earth , Wind and Fire . Others , like saxophonist Wilton Felder and pianist Joe Sample of the Crusaders , actually // were well-known jazz musicians . Still others , like Ray Charles , played jazz along with R &; B , and even James Brown cut a few soul-jazz numbers ( such as " Evil " on fames Brown Showtime ) . All this occurred before , as Andrew Hill put it , " the music got separated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in Chicago , can be seen from Clifford Jordan 's memories of his introduction to jazz in the late 1940s . Like Hill , Jordan grew up on the city 's South Side . We encountered him in the last chapter as Horace Silver 's tenor saxophonist on Further Explorations . Since then , Jordan has evolved into one of the most expressive storytellers in jazz . In a way reminiscent of Swing titans like Benny Carter or Ben Webster , he has mellowed with the years , purifying his melodic conception without losing his fire : " When you 'd go to a record store , they would n't have just thousands and thousands of pieces of material like you have now . They had the new Duke Ellington record , the new Count Basie , the new Louis Armstrong , so you could keep up with the music . " I used to hear Eddie ' Lockjaw ' Davis playing ' Doghouse ' on the jukebox , and you could hear Coleman Hawkins 's ' Body and Soul . ' Yeah , all the jukeboxes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . It was just music . It was just our music , folk music . So when I started playing saxophone , I went to the record store . I told the man behind the counter , I said , ' I 'm interested in some saxophones . What records do you have with a saxophone on it ? ' So he pulled out Ben Webster , Charlie Ventura , Coleman Hawkins , Chu Berry , Lester Young , Johnny Hodges , so I bought a few records and listened to the guys . I got to Don Byas , but it was just easy to come by the music . They had two or three key record stores in the neighborhood . " Likewise , Jordan 's own early professional experiences ( from his first gig , a dance he played in 1947 , to his arrival in New York City in 1956 ) exposed him to a wide variety of contexts and styles : " There were a few clubs that had the combos like Art Blakey and Bud Powell and Dizzy and Bird , Miles . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those clubs around , and in the mainstream of the music at that time , all these so-called jazz musicians were playing commercial gigs . We had to play for a show , for dancers , so the only time we could play something that was really like the new type of music , bop as you would call it , would be when the band had a feature on the show , but a lot of times we had to play something like ' Flying Home , ' which was a hit , and it was sort of like the house-rocking tenor solo , but people liked that . " I played behind blues singers Willie Dixon , Arbee Stidham , Jump Jackson , Cool Breeze , all in Chicago . And I also played in Helen Coles 's band , a woman who played drums from Texas . We did a little traveling to Buffalo and Peoria and places like that . Those were the kind of gigs you went on . Everybody wanted to hear some shake , rattle , and roll . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque dancers , and we had a three-piece band . This was in Calumet City , and we would play behind a screen . So I had all these kinds of experiences . " Jordan 's half-ironic comment on the influence of such work on his style reflects jazz musicians ' mixed feelings about R &; B gigs : " You try to clean house once in a while , but there 's a lot of stuff that keeps coming out . " Just as most major rhythm-and-blues singers started out in church choirs , virtually all the best hard boppers paid at least some R &; B dues . Even Jackie McLean , who identified himself early on as a bebopper and was sponsored by Bud Powell , Thelonious Monk , Charlie Parker , and Miles Davis , had experiences parallel to Jordan 's : " I played in rhythm and blues bands when I went to North Carolina in 1953 to try to go to school again , and I stayed down there for a year , and yeah , it helped me . It influenced me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time was playing saxophone , and it was him and myself and T. J. Anderson , who was a jazz and classical composer for Tufts University . He was there at that time , so we played around in the local clubs and // rhythm and blues bands , the ABA Club and different clubs in the city , backing up singers and playing blues , most of the time in one key all night depending on who was the bandleader . There was one saxophone player who used to play everything in E-flat . When he was the bandleader we played blues in E-flat all night , and I used to walk the bar with him , battle with him . I worked with him a great deal . The first record I made was not with Miles . I made a rhythm-and-blues piece with Charlie Singleton 's band called ' Camel Walkin ' where I played baritone sax , no solo . " It was also in North Carolina that McLean was first exposed to gospel music , an experience that remained semi-dormant in him until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I heard it , I heard it as a child in church , and especially when I would go visit my grandmother in North Carolina . She went to a traditional Pentecostal kind of Baptist church , tent meetings in small churches that really got into the heavy aspects of the rhythm and the people passing out , feeling the spirit and the whole thing , so I saw that as a child , and I never really put that in place again and put it into my music , even though it was there unconsciously , till Mingus 's band , which gave me a kind of resurgence of that , because he used to like to shout and play shout music and music that was closely related to the church , so my experience with Mingus might have helped me . " Thus , when McLean describes the differences between bebop and hard bop , he is also describing his own evolution and the elements of his style : " Certainly Charlie Parker kept all the roots there . I mean , he was definitely a blues player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structured on the blues form , and yet there was another kind of gospel feeling , a funk kind of feeling if I can use that term , that came into the music in the mid-fifties with Horace Silver and some of the guys that were thinking along these lines . I certainly , myself , thought along heavy blues lines , blues feeling , and my concept of it , so I just think it had more of a gospel feeling to it , a // sanctified feeling to it mixed with all the other ingredients that Bird , Bud , Thelonious gave us . " For some musicians steeped in the bebop tradition , with its cult of defiant innovation , interest in the " roots " of black music ? blues and gospel ? only awakened gradually . Indeed , McLean implies as much in his comments on gospel . Pianist Walter Bishop , Jr. , who along with McLean formed part of New York City 's second generation of beboppers and went on to play with Charlie Parker , recalls that : " My generation rebelled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even play the blues till later years . I did n't want to know about the blues because to me the generation of the blues was representative of the subservient black . We 'd graduated from that . " I had to reach a certain level of confidence , of being secure in my power to know that it was n't a drag to play the blues . Then I could let that go and relax enough to absorb some of the roots . Before that I would have been afraid to even get into that because they would think that was all I could do . Bebop was a social statement as well as music because the whole thing evolved and changed . I mean the generation that were before mine absorbed the pain and humiliation of the fact that they had to be buffoons . They made it possible for my generation to get over on pure virtuosity and ability , so I remember when I first started making professional gigs people would look at me : ' Why do n't you smile , boy ? Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that got to do with it ? I 'm serious about this . ' But I got just a little taste of what my predecessors dealt with , that they could n't be accepted as artists . They had to be buffoons . " In the late fifties , the cult of " soul " was also connected to a rise in militancy among black musicians , and the blues became a symbol of racial pride rather than of oppression . Nat Hentoff quotes a " young Negro trombonist from Detroit who came close to starvation during several months of trying to establish himself in New York , but nourished himself on the belief that the jazz at least had the authenticity that many // white musicians lacked . His playing had ' soul , ' and , as he once explained the term warily to a white jazz critic , ' that soul only comes from certain kinds of experiences , and only we ? you know who I mean ? go through what you need to have the kind of soul that makes real jazz . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed reverence for ' church ' feeling and ' funky ' blues by Negro musicians has turned into one of the most commercial jazz commodities in the past fifteen years , judging by record sales and club appearances of the neo-gospel boppers . ' I think most of that soul music is now being manufactured rather than felt , ' said a Harlem record store owner , ' but at least this is one time in jazz history when the Negroes are popularizing their own music . It would take a lot of courage for Stan Kenton or Shorty Rodgers to call one of their albums The Soul Brothers . " ' 3 If " soul " was both ( in Jackie McLean 's words ) " rooted in what Ray Charles sings , blues and gospel music " and a banner of racial self-affirmation , it was certainly a marketing device during hard bop 's heyday . Nonetheless , in their emphasis on expressiveness , physicality , and " funk " ( a word whose original meaning ? strong bodily odors , especially sexual ones ? expresses its earthiness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Art Blakey , one of hard bop 's most eloquent spokesmen , summed it up recently : " Fire ! That 's what people want . You know , music is supposed to wash away the dust of everyday life . . . You 're supposed to make them turn around , pat their feet . That 's what jazz is about . . . Play with fire ; play from the heart , not from your brain . You got to know how to utilize , make the two meet . You just do n't play out of the top of your head , or play down to the people . I think you should play to the people . " Jazz and Bohemia The period between 1945 and 1965 was an extraordinarily creative one in New York City and ? in a more dispersed way ? // in other parts of the United States as well . New York , however , was the magnet that drew artists of all sorts . Space was still cheap in lower Manhattan . America 's far-flung universities had little interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , Black Mountain College , folded in the fifties , sending much of its teaching staff and student body to New York as well . Bohemian Manhattan was an intimate , small-scale scene : a band of outsiders easily recognizable by their dress and demeanor . Groups that later would seem diametrically opposed or at least very different ? for example , the Beats and the " New York School " of poetry ? rubbed elbows amiably and frequented the same bars and jazz clubs . Being few in number , they were obliged to stick together ; in Eisenhower 's blandly conformist America , all weirdos were brothers until the opposite was proven . In addition , artists shared an exhilaration born of their recent liberation from Europe . The old American colonial complex ? a sense of being on the periphery of things , still strong among the modernists of the 1920s ? had been swept away by the triumph of abstract expressionism , by William Carlos Williams 's appropriation of American speech as a basis for new poetry , and , of course , by jazz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not all artists frequented bars and jazz joints , but a remarkable number did . The abstract expressionists ? Jackson Pollock , Willem de Kooning , Franz Kline , and others ? were hard drinkers and inveterate hangers-out . One of them , Larry Rivers , was also an accomplished jazz saxophonist and served as a point of intersection between the worlds of painting and jazz . The Beats also spent a lot of time in night spots . For the New York School ( Kenneth Koch , John Ashbery , and others ) , a key connection with jazz was Frank O'Hara , whose best-known poem , a poignantly oblique homage to Billie Holiday , is entitled " The Day Lady Died . " Judith Malina 's and Julian Beck 's Living Theatre , with its mixture of raw psychodrama and dreamy pacifism , sponsored poetry readings // at its headquarters on 14th Street and featured Jackie McLean and hard-bop pianist Freddie Redd in its production of Jack Gelber 's play The Connection . Almost anyone 's account of the era includes both this heady mixture of scenes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs as meeting places . Ron Sukenick 's Down and In : Life in the Underground , a combined study and memoir covering the period from 1945 through the eighties , describes the clientele and atmosphere at the Five Spot in the late fifties : " If the painting seemed more consciously American after 1950 , the uniquely native American art form , jazz , became , through the fifties , more central than ever for underground artist of all kinds . It came together at the Five Spot , a bar on Cooper Square where the brothers Iggie and Joe Termini hosted a basically flophouse clientele until the artist started coming in during the mid-fifties . Painters like Grace Hartigan , Al Leslie , David Smith , de Kooning became habitues . Larry Rivers , the painter , played jazz there , poets read poetry to jazz , and avant-garde film makers even showed their films to jazz . Writers like Kerouac , Frank O'Hara , and Kenneth Koch moved in , and finally the great jazzmen themselves came down to play ? Charlie Mingus , Sonny Rollins , Cecil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In response to a question about which jazz musicians downtown artists and intellectuals were friendliest with , the painter Emilio Cruz ( who also writes poetry and plays jazz drums ) gave this description of the scene : " In the case of Jackie McLean , I would think that if he was around the Living Theatre crowd , he was friendly with Judith Malina and Julian Beck and that crowd , and a number of interesting people in that company . Also Cubby Selby ; we all called him Cubby . I never knew his real name was Hubert Selby , Jr. , until his book Last Exit to Brooklyn came out . Paul Blackburn , the poet , who was a good friend of mine , knew a lot of those people . Bob Thompson the painter , Allen Ginsberg at times , Bob Kaufman // the poet , some of the Black Mountain poets . Rollins lived downtown and knew a number of artists , though he was very solitary . " Others who were there not just because it was cool but because they had a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rivers was a friend of Zoot Sims , Stan Getz . I know he considers himself as serious a saxophone player as he does a painter . During that period I lived on Jefferson Street , down by the river . Pepper Adams lived in that building underneath me . In fact , he was the only one in the building who had heat . He had a gas heater , so in the winter when he was on the road I was a lot colder than when he was there . Donald Byrd used to come by a lot because they had that band together at that time . Jefferson Street was south of East Broadway , maybe southeast , not that far from where the old Fulton Fish Market was . That 's all changed now . I do n't even know whether that street exists anymore . Ed Blackwell used to come by that building too . " That was a period , in my life , when a lot of things were integrated . Jazz was integrated within artists ' lives . A lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lived in lofts themselves , but they would come over there ( at least on the Lower East Side ) to play , to rehearse a band , so there were a lot of connections because of that . That connection would then extend what a person 's capacity was , so that one person might learn more about music , another person might learn more about painting or poetry , and I knew a number of musicians who were interested in learning about all of it . Like I 'm friends with Grachan Moncur III . I was his drummer last year at his workshop in New Jersey . He used to come visit my studio all the time . There was a lot of openness between various people . Herbie Lewis , the bass player , he lived around the corner . He was a neighbor of mine , so we spent a lot of time together . Miles . . . I know numbers of people from the beat generation who were friends with Miles , like Allen Ginsberg , Jack Kerouac , Robert Frank the photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts . The beat generation spent much of their lives in clubs . " Now one of the things that it 's very important to understand is that there were n't thousands of people involved in the arts in those days , so when you would walk down the street in New York City , you would look at somebody and you would recognize them instantly as an artist , and you would immediately find that you had some kind of rapport , and there 's another thing . I ca n't speak for right now , but there was youth . Youth reaches out . There 's one thing that was consistent in all the artists in New York City at that time . They were reaching out for new things , new ways of expressing themselves . They were attempting to discover new values . Those values were not necessarily ones that were supported by the society at large , so there was this that they had in common . Another thing was that there was an attempt to break down racism , and politically there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral state . So racism was something that in that world was frowned upon . " What did jazz mean to those experimental artists who took it most seriously ? Part of the answer , as Sukenick indicates , has to do with its American qualities , also underlined by Hettie Jones , author of Big Star Fallin ' Mama , a study of black female vocalists from Bessie Smith to Aretha Franklin : " I think jazz was the music they downtown bohemian types felt closest to , the way someone feels close to music that 's part of the zeitgeist . It was American . There 's that whole idea that abstract expressionist art was the first truly American art movement ; and those people saw themselves as an avantgarde in what they were trying to do . It was a shared feeling that they were all part of a changing American art scene . " Jazz was also influential in its improvisational freedom and structural openness , as Allen Ginsberg indicates in his description of jazz 's relationship with his poem " Howl " : " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosody . ' And the ideal , for Kerouac , and for John Clellon Holmes and for me // also , was the legend of Lester Young playing through something like sixty-nine to seventy choruses of ' Lady Be Good , ' you know , mounting and mounting and building and building more and more intelligence into the improvisation as chorus after chorus went on . . . riding on chorus after chorus and building and building so it was a sort of ecstatic orgasmic expostulation of music . So there was the idea of chorus after chorus building to a climax , which was the notion of part one of ' Howl , ' with each verse being like a little saxophone obbligato or a little saxophone chorus , as though what I was doing was combining the long line of Christopher Smart , the eighteenth-century poet , with notions of the repeated jazz or blues chorus , till it comes to a climax , probably in the verse ' ah , Carl , while you are not safe I am not safe . ' And then there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also claims jazz as an important model for his work and that of his contemporaries : " The whole point of modern poetry , dance , improvisation , performance , prose even , music , was the element of improvisation and spontaneity and open form , or even a fixed form improvisation on that form , like say you have a blues chorus and you have spontaneous improvisations , so in ' Howl ' or ' Kaddish ' or any of the poems that have a listeny style , ' who did this , who did that , who did this , ' you start out striking a note , ' who , ' and then you improvise , and that 's the basic form of the list poem or , in anaphora , when you return to the margins in the same phrase , ' Or ever the golden bowl be broken or the silver cord be loosed or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , ' as in the Bible or as in some of Walt Whitman 's catalogues or in Christopher Smart 's ' Rejoice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's free union , ' my wife with the platypus 's egg , my wife with the eyes of this , my wife with that and that . . " It jazz was a model for the dadaists and it was a model for the surrealists and it was a model for Kerouac and a model for me and a model for almost everybody , in the sense that it was partly a model and partly a parallel experiment in free form . // The development of poetics , as well as jazz and painting , seems to be chronologically parallel , which is to say you have fixed form , which then evolves toward more free form where you get let loose from this specific repeated rhythm and improvise the rhythms even , where you do n't have a fixed rhythm , as in bebop the drum became more of a soloist in it too . So you find that in painting , the early de Koonings have a motif or a theme , the woman or something like that , but it gets more and more open , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have less and less dependence on the original motifs and more and more John Ashberyesque improvisational free form flowing without even a subject matter , though I always kept a subject matter like the old funky blues myself . It was partly a parallel development within each discipline : painting , poetry , music . There were innovators who opened up the thing after Einstein , so to speak ? you know , relative measure , as Williams said ? which is in a sense something that happened with bebop : not the fixed measure but a relative measure . It was both inter-influential and parallel , also integrating . " If jazz opened up Ginsberg to " the awakening of Afric slave sensibility , of black sensibility , black funk as distinct from white , clean Doris Day ethic , and mind funk instead of wellcombed , academic , button-down poetry , " some jazz musicians , as Cruz comments , were also " interested in learning about all of it . " Many , however , were not . After all , there were still plenty of clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jazzmen , a job downtown ? at Cafe Bohemia , the Village Vanguard , the Five Spot , or wherever ? was just another gig . When I asked Walter Bishop , Jr. , about his take on the lower Manhattan avant-garde twenty-five years ago , he replied that at the time he 'd " had blinkers on , " that for him it had been " bebop or bust " ? in other words , that he 'd had no artistic interests outside jazz . Others , however , like Jackie McLean , were intensely curious about the worlds around them . McLean found his way // into painting and ( to a lesser degree ) literature through his " friendship with guys who were doing this , for instance Harvey Cropper , who was the first painter that I knew . He was the one that introduced me to Bartok , to a lot of painters , the style of Cezanne . He introduced me to Hieronymus Bosch and that opened another world . That was the painter that had the greatest influence on me , Bosch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could understand his paintings . I could look at the horror in some of his paintings and feel it when I was sick from lack of narcotics , and then when I met Bob Thompson in ' sixty-one and we became very close , I learned a great deal about painting from Bob , being around him and talking about the music and painting and what not . And of course Leroi Jones was around in those days , and we were all hanging in the Village together during that time . " McLean 's period ( 1959 ? 1963 ) with the Living Theatre also widened his interests . During these years he evolved from a promising journeyman bebopper , described by Steve Lacy in The Jazz Review in 1959 as having " the most rhythmic vitality and , so far , the least discipline " 5 of major saxophonists , into the brilliant experimentalist we hear on records from the early sixties like Let Freedom Ring and Evolution . The intensity of McLean 's experience in the Living Theatre comes through in his reminiscences about the troupe : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were people who were looking far into the future , for a better way . You had to love them to be with them , because the Living Theatre was like a big commune . Mostly everybody lived together , ate together , and were together working out each person 's problems . I did n't live with them because I had my wife and kids , but I was part of it because certainly I lived with them when we left New York , when we went to Europe . " It was weird because the day that we left , there was a big snowstorm in Manhattan and all the transportation was stopped . It was the biggest snowstorm I ever saw . The night before there was no snow . I wake up the next day , we 're The Scene $1 supposed to leave for Europe , and the phone rings . The guy says ' Jackie , this is Hacker . ' So I said ' Yeah , I know . We 're not going . We ca n't get there , ' so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We had to hire ambulances to pick everybody up . ' I said ' Jesus Christ , man , ' and I was so strung out , so sick , so my wife walked me to the hallway and we stood there with my bags and my horn and my children and this ambulance came and I went downstairs and put my bags in the ambulance and two arms came out and helped me in . We went and picked up the next guy and went to where the ship was , the Queen Elizabeth , and the whole cast was coming in in ambulances , a sick group coming in ambulances , but when I say ' sick , ' I mean sick in terms of having a better understanding of what life is supposed to be about . They were very hip people , Judith and Julian and the whole crowd . They were humanists . They were all into every aspect of art and their idea of theater was brandnew in terms of how they wanted to present it . " Bohemianism , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept was invented , it has also meant pleasure , doing what feels good , and rebellion , surreptitious or open , against constraints of all sorts . Another aspect of jazz 's attraction for Village types was its renegade connotations . Again in Emilio Cruz 's words : " Jazz became the heretic art form . What we call ' gutbucket ' has not to do so much with the guts or the bucket but it has to do with heresy . So what is unique in modern culture is the heretic form . Everything that is created , in truth , outside of the sciences which deal directly with a mechanistic culture , comes out of heresy , so that Allen Ginsberg was involved in a kind of heresy . Charlie Parker was also involved in a kind of heresy . There is the idea of violation , and that violation would attract those people that were searching for that heretic tradition . " At one extreme , such heresy and will to violation leads artists to flirt with or embrace the most perilous vices . While jazz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arts , it was also a path into the lower depths , as implied by // Sukenick 's comment on underground rebels of the 1950s : " Where are you in the mid-fifties ? Are you fighting your way up the heart-burning ladder of career , or have you finally decided there 's no place to go but down ? Burned out into a dead-end underground . Into the shadow world emblemized above all by Bebop . Digging Bop is one of the main ways subterraneans can express their cultural radicalism . " 6 Jazz 's " shadow world " was the kingdom of the hipster , a stereotype partly mythical and partly based on reality , but far more cynical than the flower-child , love-and-peace " hippies " of the late 1960s . A furtive , jive-talking sociopath , the hipster was supposedly alert only to his own whims and his craving for intense experiences . In " The White Negro " ( 1957 ) , which remains an intriguing and annoying essay , Norman Mailer wrote that " the source of Hip is the Negro for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two centuries . But the presence of Hip as a working philosophy in the sub-worlds of American life is probably due to jazz , and its knifelike entrance into culture , its subtle but so penetrating influence on an avant-garde generation ? that postwar generation of adventurers who ( some consciously , some by osmosis ) had absorbed the lessons of disillusionment and disgust of the twenties , the depression , and the war . " 7 Mailer 's piece drew heavy criticism from those in the jazz world who read it . They faulted it for presenting a series of caricatures . So it does ? not necessarily much of a defect in an essay whose tone is so exaggerated and polemical anyway ? but many of them fit , at least partly , the jazz scene at that time . What Mailer perhaps did not emphasize enough was the centrality of drugs and particularly heroin among hipsters . As Leonard Feather noted in " Jazz in American Society " ( published as a foreword to his Encyclopedia of jazz , 1960 ) : " A serious effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is its creation of a sub-society in which all the users are ' hip ' and the rest of the world is ' square . ' " " Hip talk " itself was partly a necessary camouflage for discussions of drugs , what // Mailer called " the cunning of their language , the abstract ambiguous alternatives in which from the danger of their oppression they learned to speak ( ' Well now , man , like I 'm looking for a cat to turn me on . . . ' ) . " 9 The mysterious , hedonistic yet cooled-out universe of junkies in pursuit of what Balzac called " quiet , inner enjoyment , " and their profound alienation from society as a whole ? an alienation often compounded by race ? were perceived as deeply attractive by some bohemians . Even as firebreathing a revolutionary as Amiri Baraka , who has often railed against drugs , surrenders to their sinister glamour when describing ( in The Autobiography of Leroi Jones ) his use of heroin with painter Bob Thompson in the early sixties ? this despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an overdose : " I walked all the way back to Avenue C , not to see Lucia , but to find a friend of mine , Bob Thompson , a black painter . Bob lived in a huge loft on Clinton Street . He was there with a couple of bohemians , getting high , shooting heroin . I did n't know he used it , but he was sending one of the bohemians out to cop . I dropped some money in the mitt and meanwhile used some of Bob 's ' smack ' and we took off together , down , down , and right here ! Bob and I were a number after that . " lo There can be no doubt that heroin use was widespread among jazz musicians . As Leonard Feather pointed out in " Jazz in American Society " : " Of the 23 individuals listed as winners in a recent Down Beat poll , at least nine were known narcotics users , five of them with a record of arrest and conviction . The proportion is even greater among proponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' whose principal soloists include an alarmingly high percentage with police records as heroin addicts . " 11 The percentage of junkies among hard boppers was indeed alarming and is the main reason why so few of them are alive today . Why did so many get hooked ? It has often been said that heroin can not improve one 's music . This is probably true , and // yet . . . what made Edith Piaf and Billie Holiday so haunting , and in such similar ways ? Heroin certainly induces relaxation , and with it a kind of detached lucidity , as suggested by Nat Hentoff in The Jazz Life when he quotes " one very successful musician , who compared taking heroin to ' . . . going into a closet . It lets you concentrate and takes you away from everything . Heroin is a working drug , like the doctor who took it because he had a full schedule so he could work better . It lets me concentrate on my sound . " ' 12 Still another standard explanation ? discrimination , lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was summarized by Walter Bishop , Jr. , who , like Clifford Jordan and Jackie McLean , is an ex-junkie : " The whole thing is when you 've got a whole lot to express and you ca n't express it , so it 's a form of self-medication , just trying to cool yourself out . It 's the pain of being so creative and not having avenues to express it or having your work considered less than important that could drive a man to many things . " Perhaps , after all , hard bop 's frequent combination of tough street attitudes and somber melancholy did have something to do with heroin . In any case , it was central to many of the school 's members ; hard-living , fast-burning creative torches who appeared in remarkable profusion and all too often were snuffed out at their brightest moments . It is to some of these ? lyricists , soul-jazz specialists , and tormented poets of anguish in the manner of Billie Holiday ? that we shall now turn our attention . THE LYRICISTS Brown , Farmer , Golson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gridley 's Jazz Styles : History and Analysis , a textbook designed for use in history of jazz courses , we find trumpeter Art Farmer , pianists Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris , and composers Benny Golson and Gigi Gryce classified as " hard boppers. " 1 Such musicians are indeed to be associated with hard bop for two reasons . First , they often collaborated with hard boppers ; and second , the very breadth and diversity of hard bop helped their styles to develop . But the decisive quality they share with each other is their gentle , thoughtful elegance . The distance between them and the school 's rawer exponents can be seen in Barry Harris 's account of a run-in with Blue Note Records ' Alfred Lion , who favored more highvoltage sounds : " I made a record with Lee Morgan , The Sidewinder , for Blue Note , and I went to the Blue Note man and asked him why did n't he give me a record date ? he said I played too beautiful . So I thanked him and walked out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vaguest words around . But Harris 's meaning ? tunefulness and lyricism ? is clear enough . It brings us close to what Tadd Dameron meant when 85 // he told his band in 1953 : " When I write something it 's with beauty in mind . It has to swing , sure , but it has to be beautiful . " The lesson was not wasted , for those listening included Golson and Gryce , Tadd 's main heirs ( along with Jimmy Heath ) in writing richly voiced , vibrantly melodic modernjazz originals . Such beauty was also what bebop trumpeter Freddie Webster had in mind . As harmonically sophisticated as Dizzy Gillespie and other jaggedly multi-noted beboppers , Webster played more sparely , emphasizing melody and a fat sound , dark yet brassy , that Gillespie called " the best I ever heard . " 3 Webster 's career was tragically short . He died in 1947 at the age of thirty , leaving behind only a handful of recorded solos from which those of us who never heard him in person must reconstruct his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as important as Gillespie 's or Fats Navarro 's . Webster has been frequently cited as an early influence on Miles Davis . And in 1984 , nearly forty years after Webster 's death , Art Farmer described the tonal quality of his own playing : " I would n't say it was a completely original sound , I 've heard similarities in other musicians , like Shorty Baker , Miles Davis , Freddie Webster , Benny Bailey . . . a broad sound with a little bit of edge when you want it . " 4 Webster , then , along with Dameron and Swing pianist Teddy Wilson , whose delicate , filigreed style colored Hank Jones 's and Tommy Flanagan 's music , was another major influence on hard-bop lyricists . Apart from Davis , Webster 's best-known disciple was Art Farmer . Born in 1928 , Farmer grew up in Phoenix , Arizona . In 1945 , he and his twin brother Addison ( an excellent bassist who died in 1963 just after completing his studies at the Juilliard School of Music ) spent their summer vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bebop . In an interview with Coda magazine 's Bill Smith , Farmer recalled the feeling of shared discovery among young musicians : " There was so much going on compared to Phoenix that we decided we would just stay // there . And we met all the guys around . Things were quite open . There was a lot of enthusiasm . Everybody was trying to learn . There was a general sharing of knowledge . I remember Charlie Parker came there with Dizzy and he decided to stay . We were all in the same cliche , but he would walk the street with us at night too . Looking for a place to play . If a job came we 'd take it and if it did n't we 'd just go and jam and wait until the next gig came . " 5 Farmer spent his senior year of high school in L.A. After working with Horace Henderson and Floyd Ray , he went on the road with Johnny Otis 's jazz and R &; B group . But after four months in Otis 's outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I was first trumpet in the band , with no previous experience , and I was doing it wrong . Freddie Webster told me to see a guy named Grupp , and he was a very warm and human person . I thought I 'd better stay in New York and study and get myself straightened out . I worked as a porter in a theater and studied with Maurice Grupp every day . " 6 After this period of " woodshedding , " Farmer joined Jay McShann 's band ( another ensemble combining jazz and blues ) and worked his way back to the West Coast . By now his style and technique had evolved to the point where he could hold his own with California 's leading beboppers : musicians like trumpeter Benny Bailey ( who remains one of his favorites ) ; saxophonists Sonny Criss , Teddy Edwards , Dexter Gordon , Wardell Gray , and Frank Morgan ; and pianist Hampton Hawes . Though these associations were not very lucrative ( " I played every chance I got . . . They were hard times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn . But I was one of many . There must have been a million guys there " 7 ) , they led to Farmer 's first jazz recording date : a sextet session led by Gray . Here Farmer 's style is still embryonic , though on " April Skies , " a medium-tempo cut on which he plays with a mute , one can glimpse the future artisan of carefully crafted lines . Two of the faster tracks ( " Bright Boy " and " Farmer 's Market " ) also feature trumpet solos . These are of a more conventionally // boppish order , yet here too , in Farmer 's pure , ringing tone and attention to timbre , one can glimpse his future development . In 1952 Farmer joined Lionel Hampton 's big band , which also included , at various times during his stay , Benny Bailey , Clifford Brown , and composers Golson , Gryce , and Quincy Jones . That must have been one hell of a band ! More 's the pity that , having assembled such a brilliant group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expected him to repeat his past glories , did n't allow them more freedom . Nonetheless , both Gryce and Farmer deemed the orchestra the best Hamp had ever led . As an incubator for hard bop 's more lyrical stylists , it was extraordinarily productive , as important a nucleus of major talents as any since the birth of modern jazz . We can get some idea of what it sounded like from a series of sessions recorded for French Vogue during a 1953 European tour . The tunes , Brian Blevins reports in his liner notes , " were provided mainly by Gigi Gryce and Quincy Jones ( the arrangements had probably been charted for the Hampton band but unused by that organization ) . " These arrangements are an intriguing mixture of such Swing big-band approaches as the sleek , bouncingly Basieish theme of " Keepin ' Up with Jonesy , " Dameronian tints , and orchestral ideas taken from scores by Johnny Carisi , Gil Evans , Gerry Mulligan , and others that ended up on Miles Davis 's Birth of the Cool LP . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensembles , and the constant play of surging , shifting orchestrated accompaniments all help create some of our finest examples of big-band modern jazz . These sessions , as their collective title ( Clifford Brown in Paris ) suggests , featured Brownie , Hampton 's fiery young trumpeter . Brown also cut a ten-inch LP for Blue Note in 1953 featuring charts by Gryce and Jones , but he soon veered off in another direction , playing first with Art Blakey and Horace Silver and then with Max Roach and Sonny Rollins . It was Art Farmer , heard only in ensemble passages on the Paris dates , // who went on to collaborate more extensively with Gryce and later with Golson as well . Gryce , born in 1927 and raised in Hartford , Connecticut , studied at that city 's Julius Hart School of Music , then at Boston Conservatory with Alan Hovhaness , and finally in Paris , on a Fulbright fellowship , with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger . An altoist and flutist as well as a composer and arranger , he attracted attention as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " Mosquito Knees , " all recorded by Stan Getz . In the early fifties , Gryce also contributed originals to record dates led by J.J. Johnson ( " Capri " ) , Howard McGhee ( " Shabozz " ) , Max Roach ( " Glowworm " ) , and Clifford Brown ( " Brownskin " and " Hymn of the Orient " ) . Gryce 's association with Farmer on records ( like that with Brownie ) dates from 1953 : a session for Prestige featuring Quincy Jones originals but including a Gryce composition entitled " Up in Quincy 's Room . " Like the entire web of relationships and affinities we 've been discussing ( JonesBrown ; Brown-Gryce ; Jones-Gryce ; Gryce-Golson ; GolsonFarmer ; and to complicate things further , during that same 1953 European tour , Brown and Farmer co-led a record date , with scores by Jones , in Sweden ! ) , the Gryce-Farmer connection was cemented in Hamp 's orchestra . In the fall of 1953 , after returning to Manhattan , Gryce and Farmer settled near each other : Farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1954 they co-led a band at the Tiajuana Club in Baltimore and also recorded for Prestige , but the FarmerGryce quintet did n't crystallize as a regular unit until 1955 . At that time , Gryce outlined some of the ensemble 's perspectives : " What we 've done on records so far is just the nucleus . We want to experiment with different approaches . Above all , we intend to maintain a richness , a beauty of melodic line no matter how odd the harmonies underneath might be . We want our music to be understood . " 8 Later in the same interview , Gryce went on to say : " We 're not restricting ourselves to the traditional 32-bar choruses . We 'll write and play in the frame90 HARD B o p work of any number of bars that will best express our ideas . Nor do we want to be stuck with the usual pattern whereby the piano opens with four or eight bars , then everybody states the theme , followed by each man blowing a chorus on a basic set of changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , innovative but not aridly " experimental , " was realized in three 1955 recording sessions : two with a quintet co-led by him and Farmer for Prestige ( When Farmer Met Gryce and Art Farmer Quintet ) and one with a nonet for the Signal label ( reissued on Signals , Savoy ) . All three , of course , feature Gryce originals , many of which ( for example , " Evening in Casablanca , " a forty-six-bar theme , and " Nica 's Tempo , " which is forty-four bars long ) do not fit standard Tin Pan Alley formulas . The harmonies are original and more impressionistic than had been habitual in bebop . Secondary themes , arranged accompanying figures , and motifs used to launch new solos abound , adding textural variety . On the nonet tracks , Gryce uses constantly shifting tonal colors and instrumental combinations to create dense orchestrations , yet his themes are so light and airy , so swinging and songlike , that they never bog down . Particularly notable are three ballads : " The Infant 's Song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meditating Mood , " among the most poignant compositions in modern jazz . Gryce 's tunes are perfect foils for Farmer 's solos , which highlight his slightly sour tone and his probing , off-center lines . These solos methodically explore each tune 's harmonic interstices , yet their brooding air keeps them from sounding excessively deliberate . Together , they bear out both Farmer 's statement that " I want each note to count " 10 and bassist Sam Jones 's description of him as " one of the most lyrical trumpet players in the world ? I mean he really knows how to play a melody with feeling . If you do n't have what 's needed to project from the stage to the audience then I think you 're just wasting your time . " 11 The Farmer ? Gryce quintet stayed together until June 1956 , when it disbanded , a casualty of sporadic gigs and consequent // problems in maintaining a stable rhythm section familiar with Gryce 's book . Gryce began free-lancing and eventually formed the Jazz Lab quintet with trumpeter Donald Byrd , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Gryce continued to be an active presence on the New York jazz scene , often in tandem with Benny Golson , whose reputation as the author of memorable , dark-hued originals and Dameron-influenced arrangements increasingly paralleled Gryce 's . The two collaborated on Lee Morgan 's City Lights ( Blue Note ) and Dizzy Gillespie 's The Greatest Trumpet of Them All ( Verve ) , while Golson 's recordings under his own name featured not only his own tunes but such Gryce originals as " You 're Not the Kind , " " Calgary , " " Capri , " and " Reunion . " Golson has been explicit about Dameron 's influence on his work : " Tadd 's music really ignited the spark for me . After hearing things like " Our Delight " and " Lady Bird , " I had more of a definite goal . I wanted to do more than play the tenor sax . I wanted to write . " 12 In addition , Golson 's first professional gig , after completing his schooling at Howard University , was with Bullmoose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Jones , bassist Jymie Merritt , and Dameron as pianist and sometime arranger . A friendship between the two composers sprang up , and Golson decided to dedicate a tune to Tadd : " I did n't title it , because I did n't know if Tadd would approve . After the band played it a couple of times , Tadd said he liked it . Then I told him that I 'd written it for him and asked him if it would be all right to call it ' Shades of Dameron . ' He was pleased , and so was I. " 13 Later Golson played tenor in the Dameron band that included Gryce and Clifford Brown . His stately , dignified tribute to the trumpeter , " I Remember Clifford , " has become a modern jazz classic . In the mid-fifties , Golson contributed charts to Lee Morgan 's first three Blue Note record dates , played in and wrote for Dizzy Gillespie 's big band , and co-starred with Morgan in the Jazz Messengers , to which he contributed such tunes as the sassy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are You Real ? " and " Blues March . " At the same time , Golson 's and Farmer 's paths crossed on numerous occasions . Farmer , an excellent sight reader , was in constant demand for sessions ranging from jazz versions of Broadway musicals to George Russell 's experiments with the Lydian mode . He played on Benny Golson 's New York Scene , while Golson supplied the tunes " Stablemates " ( previously recorded by Miles Davis ) for Portrait of Art Farmer and " Fair Weather " for the trumpeter 's Modern Art , on which he also played tenor . In 1959 , Farmer and Golson formed the Jazztet , a cooperative venture similar to the one with Gryce , featuring Golson 's compositions with Farmer as the most accomplished soloist . Golson , however , is an excellent saxophonist whose warm , breathy style was influenced as much by Don Byas and Lucky Thompson as by hard-bop instrumentalists . He is one of the few modern jazz composers whose tunes ? many unusual in their structures , like " Just By Myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have entered the repertoire as " standards . " Like Gryce , Golson tended to start from harmonies . As he told Ralph J. Gleason : " I first get an interesting chord structure laid out . I feel that this is very important because the soloist will constantly use it for ad libbing after the theme . I try to get a melodic line that will interweave pleasantly with the chord structure . When composing a ballad , I usually create chord and melody bar by bar . " 14 Also like the Gryce ? Farmer quintet , the Jazztet sought to balance improvisation with carefully developed charts that nonetheless would not impede swinging . But finally , like its predecessor , it had trouble finding enough lucrative work to hold onto a stable rhythm section and to keep the same trombonist , since the band was a sextet . It did make some splendid records , particularly The Jazztet and John Lewis , featuring Lewis 's " Be ! , " " Milano , " " Django , " " New York 19 , " " 2 Degrees East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow . " Lewis , of course , was the Modern Jazz Quartet 's musical director and as remarkable a jazz composer as Golson . Another // LP , a live session entitled The Jazztet at Birdhouse , had a more relaxed , " jamming " feel than most Jazztet recordings and featured particularly authoritative solos by the leaders . After switching to the Mercury label , the group disbanded late in 1962 . Farmer co-led a quartet with guitarist Jim Hall for a couple of seasons , then gigged around with pianist Steve Kuhn , saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath , and others , and in 1968 moved to Vienna . For many years he performed more frequently in Europe than in the United States . Golson also visited Europe in the mid-sixties , but in 1967 he decided to settle in Los Angeles , where he began writing for television and virtually stopped playing . Commenting in 1978 on his then recent " comeback , " he told Leonard Feather : " I 've been desperately trying to be sure that I did n't slide behind ? at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the avant-garde thing . . . During the time when I was n't playing ? and this might sound crazy ? I was doing a lot of thinking , you know , when I 'd hear things . My heart was really in it and many times I wondered when those years were going by and I did n't even take the horn out of the case , how would I do what they 're doing . How would I be functioning as part of what 's going on . And I 'd be humming and thinking what would I be playing . " When I came back , it was very hard . I never realized it would be so hard . It was the hardest thing I 've ever done in music , to pick that horn up after eight years . It took me months just to get a sound again . The lips were like tomatoes ? I had no control . It hurt my horn , for it to rest there . Just everything . It was horrible ! " 15 Gryce dropped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in 1983 in Pensacola , Florida . The Jazztet , however , was revived in 1984 with its original trombonist , Curtis Fuller , and a relatively constant rhythm section featuring pianist Mickey Tucker and bassist Ray Drummond . Today , the group plays with more distinction than ever . Farmer has matured , saying even more with fewer notes , honing his // sound ( now on fluegelhorn ) and conception to produce solos of enormous compressed power . Golson still writes tunes that stick in the mind , arresting in their melodies and original in structure . Fuller 's style has also ripened . Like Farmer , he has burnt away excess and sought to purify his lines . Today , all three musicians are respected elder statesmen , performing throughout the world and looked up to by an emerging generation of young traditionalists . Detroit Pianists If bands like Hampton 's provided one opportunity for young jazzmen to grow together , other nuclei sprang up in towns like Detroit and Philadelphia . In an interview with Whitney Balliett , Tommy Flanagan remembered the Motown scene of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson and Hank Jones and Lucky Thompson , who left early and came back to play gigs , and there were local guys like Willie Anderson , who never left . . . And there was a whole bunch of us ? some younger , some older ? who did n't get away so fast : Roland Hanna , who went to school with me ; Paul Chambers ; Doug Watkins ; Donald Byrd ; Kenny Burrell ( he loved Oscar Moore , and we put together a Nat Cole ? type trio ) ; Sonny Red Kyner ; Barry Harris ; Pepper Adams , who came from Rochester and played clarinet when I first knew him ; Curtis Fuller ; Billy Mitchell ; Yusef Lateef ; Tate Houston ; Frank Gant ; Frank Rosolino ; Parky Groat ; Thad Jones and Elvin Jones , who are Hank Jones 's brothers and came from Pontiac , a little way out ; Art Mardigan ; Oliver Jackson ; Doug Mettome ; Frank Foster , who 's from Cincinnati ; Joe Henderson ; J. R. Monterose ; Roy Brooks ; Louis Hayes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coltrane ; and the singers Betty Carter and Sheila Jordan . " We gave weekly concerts at a musicians ' collective ? the World Stage Theatre . We worked at clubs like the Blue Bird and Klein 's Showbar and the Crystal and the Twenty Grand . We // played in the Rouge Lounge , and at El Sino , where Charlie Parker worked . As teen-agers , we 'd stand outside the screen door by the bandstand , looking in at Bird . All this lasted into the mid-fifties . Then people began to leave ? Billy Mitchell ended up with Dizzy Gillespie , Thad Jones with Count Basie , Paul Chambers with Paul Quinichette , Doug Watkins with Art Blakey , Louis Hayes with Horace Silver . I stayed around until 1956 , when Kenny Burrell and I left for New York . " 16 The pianists in this crowd ? Hank Jones ( b. 1918 ) , Barry Harris ( b. 1929 ) , and Flanagan himself ( b. 1932 ) ? have in recent years produced one brilliant record after another , establishing themselves ( along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most solid modern-jazz keyboard corps around . All are superb accompanists , and all have cultivated styles that offer subtle pleasures . Chronologically , the first among them was Hank Jones , the eldest member of a family that includes brother Elvin , famous for his volcanic eruptions behind John Coltrane , and the now deceased trumpeter and arranger Thad . While Hank Jones speaks respectfully of pianists as varied as Fats Waller , Art Tatum , Bud Powell , and Al Haig , his playing derives from the Teddy Wilson and Nat Cole school of the late 1930s and early 1940s . His light , harplike touch , as though he were plucking the piano 's strings instead of striking its keys , and his gracefully restrained single-note style are a reformulation of their aesthetic in modem jazz terms . A pianist of great flexibility , he can not only " fit in " with but inspire and stimulate instrumentalists ranging from Artie Shaw to Jackie McLean , as well as singers of every variety , from Andy Williams to Ella Fitzgerald . Jones played his first New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blues singer Hot Lips Page . Since then , he has worked with so many jazz musicians that it would take pages to list them all . Some of his more notable associations were with Fitzgerald ( 1948-1953 ) , Benny Goodman , Coleman Hawkins , Charlie Parker , and Lester Young . In addition , he was virtually Savoy Records ' " house pianist " in // the middle and late 1950s , though this did n't keep him from recording for at least a dozen other labels during the same period . His exquisite sensitivity , and the refinement of his musical thinking , placed him high on everyone 's list of favorite pianists . This refinement can be heard in Jones 's solos on tunes like " Autumn Leaves " ( from Cannonball Adderley 's Somethin ' Else , Blue Note ) and " One for My Baby " ( from Wes Montgomery 's So Much Guitar , Riverside ) . Here ? and on scores of other LPs ? Jones achieves one of the most deeply relaxed grooves in jazz history . He provides a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending and descending runs of carefully modulated dynamics , deft funky touches , and a flexible rhythmic sense that constantly pushes and pulls at the beat . Jones also recorded under his own name in the late 1950s , perhaps most successfully on a solo album for Savoy and on another LP entitled simply The Trio ( with bassist Wendell Marshall and Kenny Clarke ) for the same label . This latter disc is one of jazz 's secret after-hours classics . Marshall 's velvety bass and Clarke 's perfect wrist control on brushes lay down a cushion of sound as they mesh with Jones 's dancing , skipping lines on medium tempos and his lushly strummed chords and bell-like octaves on ballads . For a while , Jones 's very discretion and " good taste , " along with his fifteen years buried in the CBS staff orchestra , seemed to condemn him to an obscurity similar to but worse than Wynton Kelly 's , since Kelly at least performed regularly in jazz clubs . During the last fifteen years , however , he has been rediscovered by a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least six albums under his own name ) . Jones is now , like Farmer and Golson , in demand around the world and esteemed as an elder statesman of modern jazz . One fellow Detroiter Jones influenced was Tommy Flanagan . The two have recorded a duet album ( Our Delights on Galaxy ) , and many of the same adjectives have been applied to their playing : " gentle " and " delicate , " for example . ReminiscThe // ing to Michael Ullman about his native city 's profusion of keyboard artists , Flanagan commented : " There was a lot of playing in Detroit ? a lot of pianos . It did n't matter what part of town . If anybody in the house played an instrument , they also had a piano . There was always a place to have a session , whether it was my house or not . We used to play with Kenny Burrell , or at Barry Harris's. " 17 Like Jones , Flanagan admires Nat Cole and Teddy Wilson ; he has referred to Jones as " a more modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked as Ella Fitzgerald 's accompanist , first from 1963 to 1965 and again for a ten-year stint that began in 1968 . It was Flanagan 's move to New York City in 1956 ( along with guitarist Burrell , who has called him his " running buddy . . . we 're the same age . We started out together ? had our first gig together " 19 ) that signaled the beginning of his recording career . Over the next few years , he appeared as a sideman on dates led by Burrell , John Coltrane ( Giant Steps , one of Trane 's most intriguing discs , an experiment with ultradense , thick and fast chord changes ) , Miles Davis , Coleman Hawkins , J.J. Johnson , and Sonny Rollins . During a European tour with Johnson in 1957 , Flanagan cut his first album as a leader : The Tommy Flanagan Trio Overseas , with bassist Wilbur Little and Elvin Jones . The record contains at least one example of Flanagan 's silky , caressing approach to ballads : " Chelsea Bridge , " the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes . But in general it is a rocking , kicking session booted along by Jones 's busily interweaving , loose-jointed brushwork . Flanagan has always played longer , twistier melodic lines than Hank Jones , and his prickly , vigorous attack is more percussive . Though not every cut is a blues , the whole side has a bluesy feel and includes two walking , medium-tempo blues : " Skal Brothers " and " Little Rock . " " Skal Brothers " relies on a call-andresponse pattern for its down-home atmosphere , while " Little Rock " creates an intimate mood of ad hoc experimentation ? of trying things out in a last set or after closing time , when so // much of the best jazz gets created . The LP concludes with two slow numbers close both to Duke Ellington 's compositions and to what used to be called " blues ballads , " and Flanagan 's solo on the last of these , " Willow Weep for Me , " builds to an exultantly shouting climax . Still another pianist with whom Flanagan has performed duets is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic jazz performances I ever witnessed was the two of them playing beneath the stone arches at Manhattan 's 79th Street boat basin while a storm approached from New Jersey and jagged lightning bolts rent the heavens . They had met early on in Detroit , shared an instructor ( Gladys Dillard , whom Flanagan recalls as teaching " the correct pianistic attack ? how to finger correctly and use the tips of my fingers " 20 ) , and often practiced together ? along with other young musicians like Pepper Adams and Paul Chambers ? at Harris 's house . Despite The Tommy Flanagan Trio Overseas and other evidence to the contrary , Flanagan has always been considered a lyricist . Harris , on the other hand , though he also has a way with ballads , is known as a driving , smoking instrumentalist . He first ventured out of Detroit in 1956 , replacing Richie Powell ? who had perished in the same automobile accident that killed Clifford Brown ? in Max Roach 's quintet . Harris soon returned home , however , and stayed in Detroit until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he settled in New York City . Like Jones and Flanagan , Harris has performed with Swing musicians ? in particular , Coleman Hawkins ? but he is more of a dyed-in-the-wool modernist than his two Motor City compatriots . Whereas Jones and Flanagan , even at their bluesiest , radiate sunshine and civility , Harris partakes somewhat of hard bop 's darker energies , especially on medium-tempo tunes , where he can establish deeply hypnotic grooves . Harris has made his mark especially as a keeper of the bebop flame . In an interview with Bob Rusch , he bristled at the very term " hard bop " : " I do n't even know what you mean when you 're talking about hard bop ? bop is bop as far as I 'm conThe // cerned . And when you think of bop and that 's Bird and Dizwe do n't have too much bop ever ? I 'm a purist . " 21 In recent years , Harris has often paid tribute , on records and in person , to Tadd Dameron , Thelonious Monk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changes in jazz since the 1940s . A disc like Barry Harris at the jazz Workshop ( recorded in 1960 with Sam Jones and Louis Hayes , Harris 's teammates in Cannonball 's rhythm section ) certainly pays its respects to bebop , most obviously in tunes by or associated with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie ( " Moose the Mooche , " " Star Eyes , " " Do n't Blame Me , " and " Woody'n You " ) . Yet the only track with a genuinely " boppish " air is Harris 's own " Curtain Call , " a bright fanfare that leads into a fleet piano solo in the style of Bud Powell , though without the quicksilvery surprise and sense of discovery that we find in Bud 's best work . The other cuts , except for " Do n't Blame Me , " which also owes something to Bud 's somber readings of ballads like " Embraceable You , " are medium tempo . Harris 's touch is weighty , deliberate . He embeds himself in the beat instead of skimming over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? together with Jones 's solidity and Hayes 's fiercely purposeful drumming ? creates a heavy swing that is one of the record 's strong points . Harris often comes down hard on the first beats of phrases that then seem to trail away ( in Whitney Balliett 's words ) " as if they were being blown out of hearing . " 22 All these factors make for an emphasis on " cooking . " More than Hank Jones or Tommy Flanagan , Harris is a pianist you pop your fingers to . But the three do have much in common . All are " musicians ' musicians " ? that is , masters of nuance who appeal to educated tastes , to listeners who can get beneath the surface of jazz , its overall " sound , " and savor the dynamics and imaginative eccentricities of specific solos . As Gary Giddins noted : " In the 1980s , they practically monopolize classical bop piano . " 23 Yet ironically , they are more conservative than the inventors // of classical bop piano . In a sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Farmer and Golson , may represent what modern jazz would have been had the bebop revolution not taken place under the sign of radical innovation . Without Bird , Monk , et al. , jazz would certainly have evolved since the 1940s , but perhaps in a less flamboyant and iconoclastic manner . This relatively subdued manner ? along with the emphasis on " beauty " that led Blue Note to reject Harris-is the source of these lyrical stylists ' affinities with the great Swing musicians . Like Benny Carter , Duke Ellington , and so many others associated with Swing , they have improved over the years , adding layer upon layer of finish , polishing and refining their art 's sheen and subtle symmetry . TENORS AND ORGANS Benny Carter and Duke Ellington represent refinement and urbanity ? but big-band Swing had a rawer , more " down-home " side as well . While this earthier variant is best known to jazz aficionados through the work of Count Basic 's orches tra , it can be heard in many other southern and southwestern " territory bands " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page and His Blue Devils and Milt Larkins 's and Jay McShann 's ensembles , performed in the main for black audi ences . Mostly , they played the blues and showcased " blues shouters , " like Jimmy Rushing in Basie 's band , who could generate big enough sounds to be heard over seventeen wailing musicians . Written arrangements were usually rudimentary or nonexi stent . Riff-based tunes would be worked out in rehearsal and performance , " by head . " Talking about his years with Basie , trumpeter Harry " Sweets " Edison remembered that " when I first joined the band we had maybe six arrangements in the entire book . Now since I was going to make music my career , I wanted to read music and learn more about it . But they kept playing and playing until I did n't know where I was . Finally I said , ' Hey , Basie , where 's the music ? ' and he answered , ' What 's the matter ? You 're playing , are n't you ? ' So I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm playing . ' And I said , ' When the band ends I do n't know what note to hit . ' Then Basie told me , ' If you hit a note tonight and it sounds right , just play that same note tomorrow . ' " 1 This Texas-Oklahoma-Kansas City ? based , riff-oriented , hard-and-sinewy orchestral sound was to have a long life in both jazz and black pop music . The backgrounds for most of B. B. King 's records from the 1950s , for instance , come straight out of it . When vibraphonist Lionel Hampton left Benny Goodman and formed his first big band in 1941 , he plugged into the Southwest scene . This was partly due to his friendship with guitarist Charlie Christian , who was at once a pioneer of modern jazz and a quintessential Oklahoma bluesman . Hampton also raided the Southwest for two tenors : Illinois Jacquet and Arnett Cobb , both veterans of Milt Larkins 's Houstonbased outfit . Jacquet , born in Louisiana and raised in Texas , scored a smash hit for Hampton with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though deep-funk tenor playing should perhaps be traced back to Ben Webster 's lusty , swaggering solos , , the honkin ' - and- screamin ' movement is usually linked to Jacquet 's outing on " Flying Home " and to his antics at Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts in the mid-forties . In their heyday , the honkers and screamers aimed at creating maximum excitement . Romping and stomping , rolling on the floor , bellowing single notes over and over , they induced paroxysms , hysteria , catharsis . Record producer Teddy Reig recalls that " when Hampton played theaters he would give everybody a fit , because he 'd get into a groove and the people would be going crazy and he just would n't quit . He 'd screw up the schedule and make overtime , and they 'd have to close the curtain . And sometimes when they did that he 'd take the band out in the audience . Lionel was the big band version of honking and screaming . " 2 Another of Reig 's anecdotes describes the end of a concert featuring baritone honker Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The place was in an uproar . People // started screaming and running up on stage as I was closing the curtain . I ran out there and grabbed Paul 's arm and said , ' Let 's get out of here ! " As Williams 's popularity grew in the late 1940s , crowds began lining up around the block for his appearances . " Every five minutes , " says Reig , " the fire department would come in and I 'd give them a bunch of tickets to count . But there were hundreds of tickets in my pockets they did n't know about . Then there was a shooting or something . Before it was over , Paul Williams closed down every dance hall in Baltimore . There was n't one left he did n't close with a riot . " The honkers were known for their blatant showmanship . Williams , for example , paid a midget to walk along the bar doing the hucklebuck while the saxophonist walked beside him and customers dropped money into the bell of his horn . Such high jinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bebop , the honkers marked a parting of the ways between highbrow and lowbrow black music ? what Johnny Griffin meant when he said promoters " took the music out of Harlem and put it in Carnegie Hall and downtown in those joints where you 've got to be quiet . The black people split and went back to Harlem , back to the rhythm and blues , so they could have a good time . " 3 In fact , however , Griffin 's lively picture was oversimplified . He himself graced Joe Morris 's R &; B outfit with his big-toned , dirty solos on tunes like " Lowe Groovin ' . " After leaving Morris , he played with Lionel Hampton 's orchestra before joining Art Blakey and then Thelonious Monk . Even in 1961 , when he was firmly established as a jazz saxophonist , Griffin described himself as " a nervous person when I 'm playing . I like to play fast . I get excited , and I have to sort of control myself , restrain myself . But when the rhythm section gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillespie 's bebop big band featured James Moody 's wild and woolly tenor work in the late 1940s . Today Illinois Jacquet , who supposedly started it all , remains a respected jazz tenorman ( see his comments on bebop 's genesis at Minton 's in Chapter 1 ) . Other honkers like Willis " Gator // Tail " Jackson , whose nickname comes from the title of his biggest R &; B hit , later emerged as seductive balladeers in the boudoir-saxophone tradition of Ben Webster and others . If the honkers ' glory days as stars in their own right were the late forties , the reverberations have nevertheless been felt ever since in both jazz and black popular music . For instance , much of the impact and musical density of Marvin Gaye records like What 's Going On and Here , My Dear come from contributions of tenormen " Wild Bill " Moore and Ernie Watts , respectively . On the back of his Ornette on Tenor album ( Atlantic ) , Ornette Coleman declared that " the tenor is a rhythm instrument , and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been on tenor saxophone . Now you think about it , and you 'll see I 'm right . The tenor 's got that thing , that honk , you can get to people with it . Sometimes you can be playing that tenor and I 'm telling you , the people want to jump across the rail . " Coleman was not the only one to think the tenor had a special relationship to black people 's " soul . " In 1950s R &; B , for every one alto star ( like Earl Bostic ) , there were a dozen tenormen . Most of the four- , eight- , and twelve-bar " breaks " on R &; B vocals were tenor solos . In hard bop , too , in the fifties and sixties , good to very good tenors outnumbered altoists of equal stature . Rollins and Coltrane were the most influential saxophonists of the period . The initial generation of postwar honkers was diverse in its aspirations . Some ? like Lee Allen of New Orleans , heard alongside Fats Domino , Smiley Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R &; B context . Others , like Johnny Griffin , gravitated toward " straight jazz " of a fairly uncompromising variety , although Griffin 's fiery declamations still recall his roots . Others worked in an area on the border between jazz and R &; B , creating a new kind of music that ended up being called " soul jazz . " These included Eddie " Lockjaw " Davis , Gene Ammons , Arnett Cobb , Red Holloway , Willis " Gator Tail " Jackson , Ike Quebec , Jimmy Forrest , and ? a little later ? Stanley Turrentine , Houston PerTenors // son , and Grover Washington . The basis for their playing lay in Swing saxophonists of the rowdier sort ? for example , Webster or Chu Berry ? but the new crop of soul-jazz saxophonists had also learned from both R &; B and bebop . Among this crop , perhaps the most interesting was Eddie " Lockjaw " Davis . Born in 1921 , Davis ( usually known as " Jaws " or " Lock " ) came of age in the late thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the big-band sounds of Chick Webb , Jimmy Lunceford , and Lucky Millinder . " I really became a musician because my kid brother was a bouncer at the Savoy Ballroom up in Harlem , " Jaws has commented . " I was just a kid then and he used to let me in for free . I used to take it all in , you know : the lights , the noise , the music . This was the big band era and the biggest guys there were the musicians . They got the awe , the girls and all the admiration . I thought straight off , that 's for you man . In the big bands , the big guys were usually the drummer and the saxophone player . The drums were a bit cumbersome but I could manage a horn so I settled for the saxophone . " 5 Eight months after he first picked up an instrument , Jaws was playing in an ensemble ( including Bud Powell ) that was hired one night in its entirety , minus saxophonist Rudy Williams , by trumpeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included arrangements by Tadd Dameron and Thelonious Monk and whose theme song was Monk 's " Epistrophy , " played at Harlem 's Savoy Ballroom , " the Home of Happy Feet , " and then , Jaws recalls , " went on the RKO theater circuit with Ella Fitzgerald , the four Ink Spots , a dancer ? Ralph Brown ? and a comedian . It was a six-month tour : three months north and three months south . " 6 After leaving Cootie , Lockjaw performed with Millinder and Louis Armstrong , and from 1945 to 1952 he led the house band at Minton 's Playhouse . Jaws has cited Coleman Hawkins , Herschel Evans , Lester Young , Don Byas , and Ben Webster ? all major Swing tenormen ? as his " real influences . " 7 In particular , he empha106 H A R D B o p sizes his early friendship with Webster ( " I used to hang out with Ben Webster . . . people used to call me ' Little Ben ' " 8 ) and Byas . Nonetheless , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a studio leading a band called " Eddie Davis and His Beboppers " that included Fats Navarro and pianist Al Haig . This is very immature Lockjaw . From a jazz point of view , his solos are badly paced . He gets hot too soon and therefore often has nowhere to go after the first few bars . Still , a number of his virtues can already be glimpsed : his percussive approach to his ax ; a penchant for descending phrases and down-bent notes that trail away melismatically ; and a wonderfully insinuating vocal sound that can erupt from dark , smoky mutterings into raw urgency in a single bar . One tune , " Hollerin ' and Screamin ' , " is a kind of raving nonstop honk-fest ( even Navarro catches the spirit ) that starts with a raunchy shout of joy and plunges into an orgy of bellows and screams that anticipate some " free jazz " of the 1960s . A few years later , in 1951 , Jaws recorded with trombonist Bennie Green in an ensemble that included Art Blakey . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On " Green Junction , " a loping , exultant medium-tempo strut , his playing is far more controlled , though it still bristles with swinging energy . His sound here is more nuanced , at once relaxed and ardent . " Whirl a Licks , " another tune from the same date , kicks off with a duet between Jaws and Green . The cut is a fastpaced flag-waver , yet Lockjaw 's solo again is well paced , using honks and screams sparingly and building to a climax . Before taking the number out , the two soloists trade phrases and finally merge in a rip-roaring simultaneous improvisation . Throughout the 1950s , Lockjaw recorded gutbucket R &; B for King Records , including such off-color vocal ditties as " Mountain Oysters . " In addition , in 1955 he formed a trio with organist Shirley Scott that would stay together till the end of the decade . By now , his jazz style had mellowed still further as he evolved into a master of the ballad . On " But Beautiful , " // recorded with Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his time is so loose , his tone so breathy and erotically charged , and his timbre and phrasing so original that he makes it entirely his own . Indeed , by 1958 Jaws had evolved into an example of everything that gives a jazzman a " voice . " Never a great musical thinker , he created a combination of hot funk and tenderness that has been his trademark ever since . In the early 1960s , Jaws formed a two-tenor combo with Johnny Griffin that helped to solidify his jazz bonafides . As Lockjaw remembered it : " At first we had some difficulty finding engagements ? probably because of the image people had of me as a honking , loud rhythm and blues performer . In fact , one guy came up to me and said that he was a club owner and had had three opportunities to book us into his place but turned them down because he thought I was strictly an R &; B tenor . After hearing the quintet , he said he was happy to admit he was wrong and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-tenor idea had been tried before in modern jazz , especially by Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray and by Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt , but never with such musically gratifying results . The contrast between Jaws 's warm sound and laid-back rhythmic sense and Griffin 's impetuous rapidfire lines made the quintet more a study in contrasts than a " battle . " It recorded at least half a dozen superb albums before disbanding in 1963 . One highlight was the tune " Abundance " ( pronounced , in appropriately sexy fashion , " A Bun Dance " ) . Here we find Lockjaw in top form , playing spare , carefully constructed lines and using vibrato to grab notes and rock them from side to side at moments of peak intensity . More than anything else , the unit with Griffin established Lockjaw 's place in jazz circles . If Lockjaw ( along with Gene Ammons ) stands out among the older generation of soul tenors , Stanley Turrentine occupies a similar position , to my mind , among the younger group . His self-evaluation ( " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a stylist " 10 ) could be applied to Lockjaw too . Born in // Pittsburgh in 1934 , Turrentine took up the saxophone at the age of eleven , encouraged by his father , who had played the same instrument with Al Cooper 's Savoy Sultans . Turrentine 's first professional gig was with Lowell Fulsom 's blues band . " I guess my sound started back then , " he says . " I could n't avoid the blues . That band had a blind piano player in it , name of Ray Charles . " Charles was already writing songs , which Turrentine would transcribe after they finished work in the joints and barns the band played . After leaving Fulsom , Turrentine moved to Cleveland , where he gigged with Tadd Dameron before going on the road again in Earl Bostic 's R &; B combo . Following two years in the army ( 1956-1958 ) , he joined Max Roach . It was at this point that Turrentine began to make an impression in the jazz world . In particular , he caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive contract with Blue Note Records that lasted until 1969 . During this ten-year period , Turrentine recorded regularly as a sideman for the label on albums by Horace Parlan , Art Taylor , Jimmy Smith , Duke Jordan , Horace Silver , Duke Pearson , and Kenny Burrell . For several years in the 1960s , he co-led a combo with his wife , organist Shirley Scott ( who had previously accompanied Lockjaw ) . " We called it the ' Chitlins Circuit . ' A lot of small places , with bad sound systems , small audiences . . . We used to deadhead a lot . Twice we drove to the coast in three days , New York to L.A. , eating in the car , sleeping in the car , with the organ in a little trailer in the back . You 'd get there to the gig and for days you 'd still feel like you 're still riding . It 's funny now ; it was n't so funny then . We 'd get to clubs where the hallways were too narrow for the organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ up three flights of fire escapes . But for all that , we 'd go in that night and we 'd blow our hearts out . " i l Turrentine 's work has been remarkably consistent , and he 's still going strong , as his performances on Jimmy Smith 's recent Off the Top LP show . When he hit the scene in 1960 , // " soul jazz " was something of a fad . Prestige Records ran ads in Down Beat saying : " Despite opposition of critics , Prestige gave birth to soul jazz , " 12 while references to " soul , " " funk , " and black cuisine seemed to crop up in the titles of half the albums issued . Some of the " soul " being purveyed was more jive than real , but Turrentine was the genuine article . As Clifford Jordan put it : " Some people can play that and really extend that , like King Curtis or Stanley Turrentine . They can play that little snap . It 's right in their body and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that they project . " Turrentine 's " snap " ( described by Michael James as his " pronounced taste for inflections , often bending the final note of a phrase upward in a most unusual and effective way " 13 ) is pervasive on That 's Where It 's At , a side he cut for Blue Note with pianist Les McCann , bassist Herbie Lewis , and drummer Otis Finch . Except for the ballad ( " Dorene Do n't Cry I : . . . " ) , all the numbers are either blues or near-blues . What first leaps out and grabs the listener 's attention is Turrentine 's sweet yet muscular sound , which suggests Johnny Hodges more than the classic Swing tenors . A flexible voice , it can deepen to a resonant honk , soar into one of the most piercingly fullthroated cries in jazz , and broaden to a thick , sensuous vibrato on ballads . Turrentine tends to play on top of the beat , making for a deep , trancelike groove , and his phrasing draws on both modern jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phraseology . That 's Where It 's At , which represents " soul jazz " at its most eloquent , also owed much to McCann 's orchestral blues- and gospel-soaked style , as well as to the exquisite ballad he contributed to the date . ( McCann has composed a number of memorable ballads , another of which , " Fayth , You 're . . . , " can be heard on his Les McCann in New York album . ) If the tenor was one pillar of soul jazz , the other was the electric organ ? to be exact the Hammond B-3 ? which in effect
