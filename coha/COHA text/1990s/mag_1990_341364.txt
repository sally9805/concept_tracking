She 's blond . She 's seductive . She 's just killed her husband . Oh , sure , it was probably self-defense : the guy had disguised himself as a burglar , broken into their house and tried to kill her before she plugged him with a .357 Magnum . Still , you know she 's trouble . <P> He 's a police detective with a seedy apartment , a 5 o'clock shadow and , against his better judgment , a yen for the blond . It 's the old story : boy meets girl . Boy suspects girl . Boy borrows girl 's car and is almost killed when the brakes mysteriously fail . <P> The steamy couple , played by Harry Hamlin and Nicollette Sheridan , develop their near fatal attraction in Deceptions , a made-for-cable movie that aired on Showtime last month . It was perhaps the definitive example of the hottest new ticket on the cable dial : the film-noir thriller . Gotham , a moody mystery about a Manhattan detective ( Tommy Lee Jones ) investigating an enigmatic woman ( Virginia Madsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highest-rated made-for-TV movie in 1988 . Third Degree Burn , starring Treat Williams as a private eye hired to tail another mysterious blond ( Madsen again ) , was the most-watched original film on HBO last year . The USA Network , which is churning out made-for-TV films  --  most of them murder mysteries  --  at the rate of two a month , scored its best ratings ever with The China Lake Murders last January . Even Lifetime , the cable channel for women , will get into the act late this month with Memories of Murder , starring Nancy Allen as an amnesia victim . <P> In the mode of such Hollywood classics as Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep , these cable-noir thrillers feature tales of murder , treachery , lust and double-dealing . The mood is somber , the detectives usually disillusioned and the blonds nearly always dangerous . A bit more graphic in sex and violence than network movies , cable-noir films go straight for the gut . And their aim is true . The cable networks may get more attention for their high-minded docudramas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man for All Seasons ) . But these unpretentious B movies are their doughy bread and butter . <P> Which is not to say that many of them are not junk food . In Curiosity Kills , last month 's USA entry , C. Thomas Howell and Rae Dawn Chong play a photographer and his neighbor who suspect a new tenant of being a killer ; despite some bloody violence , it 's routine Nancy Drew hokum . USA 's Dead Reckoning contrived to place a rich doctor ( Cliff Robertson ) , his wife and her former lover on a pleasure boat together in the middle of the ocean , then promptly sank in a sea of implausibility . <P> Others tinker more creatively with the familiar noir premise of treachery getting its just deserts . In Backfire ( Showtime ) the wife of a disturbed Vietnam vet plots to drive him crazy so he 'll attempt suicide . He obliges only to the extent of lapsing ( darn the luck ) into a catatonic state , which is only the beginning of the wife 's comeuppance . In Buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leigh ) conspires with her doctor lover to bump off her husband with poison . Again the plan goes awry : she gives him too small a dose , and the authorities only think he 's dead . What follows is Poe- etic justice .
