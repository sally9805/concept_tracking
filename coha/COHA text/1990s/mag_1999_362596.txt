The flash of blue light was the first sign that something was horribly wrong . Three workers feeding uranium into a tank were jolted by the flash inside the JCO uranium-processing plant , 85 miles northeast of Tokyo . One of them was knocked unconscious . Within minutes , the others were nauseated , and their hands and faces were burned bright crimson . The way they had handled stainless-steel pails full of uranium 235 had caused the worst nuclear accident in Japan 's history . <P> As the workers soaked up potentially lethal doses of radiation , still more leaked from the plant in Tokaimura , the hub of the Japanese nuclear power industry . Eventually , more than 300,000 people in Tokaimura and eight nearby towns were bunkered in their homes , waiting to find out how badly they were affected . Meanwhile , 28 million people in metropolitan Tokyo , downwind of the accident , wondered about their fate . As the hours ticked by , a plodding government dithered and displayed once again its inability to come to grips with a huge nuclear power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chernobyl and it was n't Three Mile Island , but the accident was bad enough . Though authorities eventually gave the all clear , the full extent of the damage is unknown . But what made it most frightening was the amount of time that passed before anybody seemed to know just how bad it was or was n't . At one point , radiation levels a mile or so from the plant were 15,000 times higher than normal for an urban setting ; 46 workers were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation . U.S. and European experts said backup safety measures should have automatically shifted into gear to halt the disaster . But the facility , housed in a bland-looking white five-story building just 60 ft. from the nearest residential housing , apparently had no such safety precautions . <P> The factory , built in 1982 , is part of the fuel supply line for an experimental fast-breeder nuclear power plant . It is where fissionable U-235 is combined with nitric acid to produce uranium dioxide , which is then combined at another plant with plutonium to produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JCO , workers inexplicably mixed far more than the normal amount of uranium  --  35.2 lbs . instead of 5.2 lbs .  --  with the acid . Then they used stainless-steel buckets rather than pipes  --  again , inexplicably  --  to pour the liquefied uranium into the tank . The high concentration of uranium started the nuclear fission that normally occurs in power reactors . Power plants have equipment to moderate such chain reactions . Fuel-processing plants do n't . <P> In the town of Tokaimura , none of the 33,900 residents could see the flash or know that radiation was escaping . Nor did they find out soon . Members of the Kawano family , who live in the vicinity , were drawing water from the family well to wash vegetables and brush their teeth . Two hours after the accident , teenager Yoshitaka Nanbara wandered to a friend 's house , just a few yards from the facility 's back fence . The two youngsters spent an hour or so playing Biohazard on a Sony PlayStation . Loudspeakers mounted on telephone poles around the town , built to warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
