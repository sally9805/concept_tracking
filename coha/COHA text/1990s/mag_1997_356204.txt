The saga of Newt Gingrich 's ethics suddenly resembles a brawl between blindfolded boxers who flail away so wildly that each lands a haymaker on his own jaw . About the only certainty is that Gingrich 's narrow re-election as Speaker of the House last Tuesday was not the end of it . <P> The Democrats ' war on Gingrich took a dubious turn last week when they rolled out a new weapon : electronic eavesdropping . First , the history : on Dec. 21 , Gingrich gave the House ethics committee a statement admitting he had given it wrong information  --  inadvertently , he said . He agreed not to launch a G.O.P. spin campaign to refute the charges . But then he appeared at least to bend that promise in a conference call with G.O.P. leaders , when he strategized about the content and timing of the statements they would put out . Congressman John Boehner joined in by cell phone from Florida ; a scanner picked up the chat , and it was recorded by a local couple . On Friday excerpts appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Democratic Congressman who got it from the couple . <P> But the next twist comes with the identity of the Congressman ; Republican leadership sources tell TIME they strongly suspect Jim McDermott , ranking Democrat on the ethics committee . A committee source , interviewed by TIME , claims to have overheard McDermott talking to a Florida couple , who insisted on giving him a package in person . House Republican leaders say they have learned that McDermott discussed the conference call with special counsel James Cole before any news of the call appeared in public . They insisted that the call had not violated any deal and quickly went on the offensive , charging that intentionally intercepting and taping private phone conversations , or circulating tapes or transcripts of them , are illegal . And for a member of the ethics committee to engage in such chicanery amid a pending investigation , they said , would be especially unsavory . McDermott , through a spokesman , declined TIME 's request for comment . <P> Gingrich 's fate led to partisan bloodletting . After 14 hours of wrangling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : five days of hearings , then a vote on Gingrich 's punishment and then Cole 's report . Both sides woke up horrified . Republicans hated the public hearings . And Democrats demanded that Cole 's report precede any vote ; O.K. , said committee chairwoman Nancy Johnson , rearranging the schedule to leave perhaps a day for hearings  --  which must now compete on TV with Clinton 's Inaugural . Says an aide to a top Democrat : " We screwed it up . " <P> So , of course , did Gingrich with his conference call ; and the Democrat who leaked the tape . The self-inflicted wounds are likely to reinforce the conviction among voters that " House ethics " ( like " White House ethics " ) is a contradiction . <P>  --  By George J. Church .
