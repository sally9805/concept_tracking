WHEN A CONSERVATIVE COALITION came to power in Den mark in 1982 , similar governments were already in place in England and the United States . While the extremism of Thatcher and Reagan would never have stood a chance in the middle-of-the-road political culture in Denmark , the impotence of the Social Democratic Parry during the preceding economic and political crisis had created oppommc conditions for Danish conservatives to roll back the Danish welfare state in order to give more room for private initiative . From 1982 until 1993 , three consecutive conservative governments fostered ideological and substantive changes in the Danish welfare state ; 1 but conservative policies in three areas : economic policies , social policies , and the public sector . We conclude with a discussion of current trends and potential future developments in the Danish welfare state . I <p> The modern welfare state is sometimes associated with a high level of public social expenditure , more often a combination of state-ran social welfare programs and extensive state intervention in the economy . Although exponents of the " welfare society thesis " ( Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society are equally important sources of social welfare , we conceptualize the modern welfare state as a social configuration in which the state has extensive social responsibilities , the economy is Fordist and high-growth , civil society is integrafive , and-perhaps most characteristic  --  the state apparatus maintains central organizing roles in both the economy and civil society . <p> The overall goal of the modern welfare state has been to unite economic prosperity with redistributive social justice . Implementation of this goal has involved profound reorganizations of intrasocietal relations in the state , the economy , and civil society . Changes in economic relations were already underway at the beginning of this century , when several western democracies proposed ambitious plans to nationalize major industries and banks . Howevcr , these plans were discarded in most countries in favor of Keynesian macro-economic policies during the economic depression of the I930S . The main cause of the depression was that capitalist mass production was not matched by an adequate level of mass consumption . Keynesians aimed to stimulate economic growth by strengthening national competitiveness through wage and currency adjustments , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand-management policies ( Mishra 1984,17 ) . But if Keynesian macro-economics was expected to create a smoothrunning economy by alternate applications of accelerator and brakes , the Fordist compromise was to have been its motor , especially after World War II . In the Fordist compromise , workers accepted the introduction of new means of mass production in exchange for increases in real wages ; the assumption was that workers could then purchase standardized consumer goods which they had produced on assembly lines ( Boyer 199O , 16 ) .2 Eventually , the relation between state and civil society in most western countrics fell within a Beveridgean welfare model ? which generalized Fordist norms of mass consumption and  --  via extensive political struggle and social compromise  --  augmented voluntary charity associations ' private insurance schemes with public welfare systems based upon collective solidarity ( Einhorn and Logue 1989 , 131-3 , 140-3 ) . <p> The founders of the Scandinavian welfare state model were definitely inspired by Henry Ford , but they anticipated John M. Kcyncs and William Beveridge ( Andersson and Mjoset 1987 , 227-43 ; Einhorn and Logue 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Fordism was introduced by way of imitation , the Swedish economist , Ernset Wigforss , advocated demand-management years before Keynes , and the Danish politician , Karl K. Steincke , advocated a publicly financed social security system some years before the Beveridge Report was released . Although development of modern welfare states in Scandinavia was uneven , the results reflected some uniform institutionalized combinations of Fordism ( albeit with relatively small mass-producing sectors ) , state commitments to improve the social welfare of the entire population rather than just eradicating poverty , and highly integrative civil societies dominated by social democratic values . <p> By the early 1970s , Denmark constituted a peculiar variant of this Scandinavian model . The state was more universally responsible than the model itself , that is , private insurance ( e.g. contributory employment pensions ) played , and continues to play , a minor role ( Rold Andersen 1984 , 34 ) . At the same time , Denmark was less Fordist due to a mismatch between the available supply of indigenously produced consumer goods and actual demand . In addition , persistent classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle classes , placed checks on social-democratic elements and policies . Nonetheless , the causes of sustained economic growth in Denmark after World War II were similar to those in Norway and Sweden . All three countries integrated their social-democratic versions of the Fordist compromise ( negotiated indexation of nominal wages to price increases and productivity gains in the context ofsolidaristic wage policies ) into an emerging international system of Fordism . Moreover , public welfare systems in all three countries werc designed to protect personal incomes and promote equality via tax-financed transfer payments and social services . Hence , transfer payments during this time in these Scandinavian countries were usually high and social services are usually free , and vertical redistribution among different income groups was advanced by progressive income taxation . In addition , state interventions were guided by a commitment to promote full employment and to avoid inflation and balance-of-payments deficits . The typical means to these ends were fiscal and monetary policies as well as intermittent applications of industrial and employment policies ( although less of the latter in Denmark than elsewhere in Scandinavia ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state was an ideological assumption : a productive society is an organic community in which disruptive effects of traditional class divisions are mitigated by considering all individuals citizens with equal rights to social welfare services . In other words , the Danish welfare state presented itself as an inclusive , one-nation project held together by excluding extremes on the both the left and the right . Indicators of the relative success of this project during the I9960s include a decline in industrial conflicts , a stable party system , and the end-of-ideology debate . Moreover , economic growth rates in the I960s were high and full employment was achieved . Although social reforms and improvements in the quality of social services produced a fast-growing public sector and record levels of taxation , Danes continued to support the expansion of thc welfare state . <p> A world-wide recession in 1973-74 caused by exhaustion in the Fordist mode of development and a steep rise in oil prices in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war upset Denmark 's post-war economic prosperity ( Andersson and Mjoset I987 , 234  --  6 ) . Inflationary pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy relatively hard bringing rising inflation and unemployment . Although the Danish economy survived thc initial shock thanks to niche-orientated industrial exports and European Community ( EC ) - sheltered agricultural exports , Danish demand-side Fordism experienced problems during the second half of the I97os , and an economic depression became unavoidable . A rise in the capital-to-labor ratio could not spark an equivalent rise in labor productivity , and the profit rate and the level of productive investment declined . Inflation skyrocketed as attempts to compensate for the nominal fall in profits by raising consumer prices resulted in significant wage increases due to the formal system of wageprice indexation . The stagflation crisis put pressure on tax-financed welfare provision and counter-cyclical economic state intervention ( Mishra 1984 , 19 ) . Economic stagnation coupled with inflation made it difficult to finance rising costs of a comprehensive system of welfare provision without increasing the public debt to a level where the interest burden and its incquality-creating effccts on income distribution became serious problems . At the same time , high inflation combined with unexploited production capacitics and aggravated balance-of-payment problems made cxpansionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The persistence of the cconomic crisis led various opinion leaders to believe that reshaping intrasocietal relationships was both necessary and urgent . However , popular support for the modern welfare state remained intact as a majority of Danes continued to support collectively provided welfare ( Andersen 1991 , 154-7 ) . At the same time , new social movements opposed the increasing cornmodification and bureaucratization of social life which thc modern welfare state had encouraged ( Einhorn and Logue 1989,17 ) . For example , parliamentary opposition to cornmodification was voiced by the leftist Socialist People 's Party , whereas opposition the rightist Progress Party vociferously opposed bureaucratization . But even a fierce anti-tax campaign mounted by the Progress Party did extend to a backlash against the welfare state itself . Despitc such growing dissatisfactions with cornmodification and bureaucratization of Danish social life , popular support remained high for a solidaristic welfare state . <p> Such support did not extend to include the Social Democratic Party , however , which an increasing number of Danes now associated with an ossified form of the welfare state and general incompetence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the party lost 12 percent of its former supporters during the 1973 parliamentary elections . The Social Democrats gradually recouped this loss in the following two elections , ncarly reaching their pre-crisis level of 38 percent of total votes cast in I979  --  only to recede again ( to 32 percent ) in the next two elections . Throughout this pcriod , the Social Democratic Party managed to cobble together minority governments with smaller centrist parties . Eventually , center-seeking policies alienated the trade unions , whereas perceptions that the coalition 's Social Democratic leadership was the economic crisis caused thc center parties to withdraw parliamentary support. 4 In 1983 , the Social Democrats surrendered the government to a coalition of bourgeois parties led by the Conservative , Poul Schliiter , the new prime minister . What was expected to be a brief interlude turned out to be the most stable period of government in Danish post-World War n history . Ten years of uninterrupted rule gave the conservative coalition government the opportunity to challenge the welfare state largely associated with the Social Democratic Party . CONSERVATIVE REORGANIZATION POLICIES <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public policies implemented during the period 1982-93 . We focus on the apparent intentions behind these policies , their effects on macro-economic problems and citizens ' living conditions , and some international parallels . <p> During the 198OS , two conservative coalition governments gave top priority to securing a stable exchange rate , in the belief that such actions would help solve other macro-economic problems such as inflation , the foreign-trade deficit , and the state budget deficit . These economic imbalances , along with unemployment , were considered the most important economic problems in Denmark during the 1980s and into the early 1990s . Inflation hurts welfare because it leads to a depreciation in the value of money and stocks . A deficit on foreign trade means that a country receives more goods , services , or interest from other countries than it exports . In such a situation , the national welfare burdens is heavier than domestic production can shoulder . In addition , a deficit in the central government budget transfers the burden from the current generation to future generations , although steady economic growth could minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential production and welfare . In short , the conservatives had good reasons to be concerned about economic imbalances . <p> During the period 1983-86 , the government 's economic policies aimed to increase the competitiveness of Danish products through income policy and to secure a stable currency . The government was successful in lowering the inflation rate , increasing employment in the private sector , and reducing the deficit in thc state budget . It owed a considerable debt to the general growth in the international economy in the early 198OS caused by a highly cxpansionary fiscal policy in the United States . Unfortunately , the economic growth also resulted in an increased deficit on foreign payments . Over the next seven years , from 1986 to 1993 , the government stimulated savings and thereby successfully reduced the foreign payments deficit . However , such actions increased unemployment . Overall , fiscal policy was remarkably lax after 1987 , in contrast to the period 1982-86 ( Hoffmeyer 1993 , 123-5 ) . Concomitantly , structural changes in unemployment insurance , education , and public services  --  modernization and privatization  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rosted 199O , 63-9 ) . <p> The conservative strategy to increase employment was designed around stimuli in the private rather than the public sector , on the assumption that an increase in private employment would reduce both unemployment and public expenditures . Together with a restrictive budget and monetary policy , increases in private employment were expected to generate higher tax revenues and to reduce deficits in foreign trade deficit by increasing exports and reducing imports ( Ministry of Finance 1994 , 10-1 ) . <p> Throughout the 1980s , the government sought to ease conditions for the private sector by lowering corporate taxes , ending formal indexing of wages , and issuing strict wage guidelines . In prior decades , wages were normally a matter regulated by the employee and employers ' associations through biennial negotiations , resulting in relatively stable labor markets . In the 198OS , however , the Conservative4ed government mandated a maximum wage increase for the first time since World War II , 2 percent in 1985 and 1.5 percent in 1986 ( Danish Parliament 1985 ) . The result of this state intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demonstrations . The government defended its policy as a departure necessary to keep wage increases in Denmark within the same range as in other countries so that a competitive private sector would create more jobs . The trade unions had anticipated a climate of restraint in 1981 and 1983 by accepting very marginal wage increases . Thus , trade union restraint , devaluation of the Danish crown between 1979-81 , and disciplined monetary policy after 1982 help explain why the competitiveness of Danish products increased so remarkably  --  not just conservative government policies ( Ministry of Finance 1985 ) . <p> For all these reasons , therefore , in the first half of the 1980s , the Danish economy was running at full steam . Between 1982 and 1988 , new employment totaled more than 110,000 , roughly 17,000 of them in the public sector . As the conservatives had expected , most of the expansion occurred in the private service industry . But manufacturing also expanded , with 24,000 new jobs in 1984  --  86 . After 1988 , however , employment in the private sector declined , yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 and 1993 ( Danish Statistical Bureau 1992 , 1994- ) . Also , net unemployment rose due to an increase in the size of the labor force . Moreover , the number employed in the public sector was not reduced while conservative coalition governments were in power . Reductions in central government staffing were out paced by increases in employment by local governments in order to cope with decentralization . The net effect was a rise in the number of public employees , even as the government succeeded in lowering total public expenditures by 2 percent ( Danish Statistical Bureau 1992,1994- ; Kjaersgaard 1994- ) . <p> Although payments to the unemployed represented a huge burden on the central government , state budgets ( excluding interest on the national debt ) showed surpluses during the period 1984-91 . However , the need to finance interest and payments on loans resulted in an increase in the state debt from 274 billion DKK in 1982 to 575 billion DKK in 1992 . GDP rose in the same period from 464 to 860 billion DKK . In relation to GDP , the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public finances caused the conservative coalition government to increase taxes and broaden the tax base . In 1982 , direct and indirect taxes accounted for nearly 47 percent of state income ( GNP in current prices ) ; by 1992 , tax contributions reached about 51 percent . a Although tax brackets were as high as 68 percent , conservative coalition governments did not reduce them . Nor did they reduce corporate taxes . Instead , the government increased indirect taxation ( i.e. VAT ) to 25 percent , equalized the treatment of interest income and deductible interest payments , and added a tax on the real interest earned by the private pension funds . Among coalition parties , such controver sial taxes represented a policy reversal for the Conservatives and the Liberals  --  and generated intense public opposition . <p> Budget surpluses , obtained mainly through increasing tax rates , illustrate fundamental changes in fiscal policy during the 1980s over the previous decade . In essence , the actions taken to keep inflation low and to stabilize the value of the DKK during the early 1980s ended the Keynesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy shifts were considered . For example , Parliament debated extended privatization , cut-backs in unemployment benefits , and tax reductions for higher incomes groups ( Ministry of Finance 1989 ) . Despite a relatively contractive fiscal policy between 1978-92 , conservative changes in the mix of expenditure and finance seem to have softened the effects of the international recession on unemployment in Denmark ( Ministry of Finance 1993 , 329 ) . <p> Throughout the 1980s , the central government undertook several initiatives to alter budgeting techniques and fiscal relations with local governments ( Andersen forthcoming ) . Local government in Denmark has its own economic base in terms of primary income taxation and has traditionally enjoyed a high degree of autonomy with respect to its expenditures . Therefore , the central government often confronted steering problems when it revised fiscal policies and attempted to eliminate foreign trade deficits . Eventually , the ruling coalition issued " guidelines " for local government expenditure ( in 1985 ) , placed limits on tax increases ( in 1986 ) , and promulgated regulations on local government functions ( Sehested et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomy at the local level ( Andersen forthcoming ) . <p> Three conservative coalition governments succeeded in eliminating deficits in foreign trade . In 1982 , the foreign trade deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP ; in 1993 , the surplus amounted to 3 percent of GDP . This switch from red to black in the balance of payments largely resulted from a decrease in imports , not a boom in foreign demand for Danish goods and services . Even though Danish companies had become more competitive since 1987 , they had only partial success in the export markets . While the export of services increased , no concomitant increase in the export of goods took place . Danish exports were targeted for mediumto-low growth economies such as Sweden , Germany , and Great Britain ( Ministry for Business 1993 , 1994 ) . On the other hand , Danish share of expanding markets in high-technology goods was declining ( Ministry of Labor et al . 1986 , 16 ) . The central government attempted to alter these conditions through interventionist and selective technology policies ( Sidenius 1989 , 63-5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ministry of Industry 1983 ) , soon followed by a host of other technology programs . Total costs of Danish technology policy nearly doubled between 197O and 1988 when measured in fixed prices ( Christiansen and Sidenius 1988 , 256 ) . In 1989 , however , disagreements between Conservatives and Liberals caused the ruling coalition to dismantle thc new industrial policies . The grand plan for economic recovery launched in 1989 became a neo-liberal tax cutting plan , devoid of the industrial policies favored by Conservatives because of their success in improving the foreign trade balance . <p> Developments in the energy market also had a salubrious impact on Danish foreign trade . In 1982 , energy imports amounted to about 20 percent of total imports . Ten years later , energy was 6 percent of total imports ( Danish Statistical Bureau 1994 ) . Whereas fuel and oil prices had skyrocketed during the 1970s , they declined rapidly in the 1980s . In Denmark , educational campaigns and extensive investments in energy saving systems by households , companies , and the public sector brought significant reductions in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas helped the country reduce its dependence on oil . At the same time , North Sea production of both oil and natural gas expanded rapidly during the 1980s . Although Denmark produced only 758,000 tons of oil and no natural gas in the North Sea in 1981 , the figures in 1992 were 7,756,000 tons of oil and 3,893,000 million m 3 of natural gas . <p> When the Danish crown was devaluated in the 1970s , the cost of interest payments on the foreign debt increased ( Ministry of Finance 1993 , 332 ) . When the first conservative coalition came to power , it signaled financial markets that it was committed to a stable crown in relation to other currencies in the European Monetary System ( EMS ) by balancing the national budget . Interest rates on international loans were reduced . Compared to most European currencies thereafter , the crown was revaluated  --  as much as 7 percent in 1990 when other economies in Europe were faring badly . Danish exports suffered as a consequence , even though wages in Denmark grew relatively slowly . Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crown was effectively devalued by 35 percent because Germany was the largest importer of Danish goods and services ( Jensen , Thomasen , and Wildt 1992 , 97-101 . During the 1980s , liberalization of the capital market also increased capacity to borrow money through channels other than the Danish banks , and rules regulating transactions between banks and private households were relaxed . As a result , it became difficult , if not impossible , for the central government to control the flow of capital to private households . But the combined result of reductions in the balance-of-payments deficits after 1986 , reductions in interest payments on international loans , and revaluation of the crown was a significant reduction in foreign debts ( both public and private ) from about 40 percent of GDP during the mid-1980s to about 28 percent of GDP in 1992 . <p> Currently , Denmark has one of the lowest inflation rates among EC countries and experiences continued reductions in the difference in interest rates between itself and the other OECD countries . An important source of the reduction in Danish interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s , and especially in the early 1990s and the elimination of devaluation expectations . Meanwhile , low domestic consumption in the late 1980s and modest wage increases contributed to low inflation . However , when the export of goods from Danish manufacturing industry was not able to compensate for a reduction in domestic demand , unemployment rose . But rising unemployment , decentralization of wage negotiations , and low inflation resulted in lower wages , which in turn helped lower inflation even more . As a result , the Danish economy did not experience dramatic supply-side inflation during the 1980s . Indeed , wage pressures diminished and prices of imported raw materials decreased . <p> To sum up , three conservative coalition goveruments between 1982 and 1993 succeeded in lowering inflation , balancing foreign trade , and improving the state budget . Certainly , some of these improvements are attributable to Social Democratic policies in the 1970s , while others were duc to changes in external conditions . But conservative economic policy-making in the 1980s contributed as well , although it differed from the radical supply-side activities in Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic successes in Denmark was increased unemployment . <p> The unemployment rate in Denmark rose from about 2 percent of the labor force in the carly 1970s to about 9.8 percent in 1982 ; it reached about ii percent in 1992 . The numbers of long-term unemployed increased significantly , especially among young people ( Hansen et al . 1994- ) , causing social and economic problems for the affected families . The steep rise in unemployment also caused major economic problems for the state because the state finances approximately two-thirds of the cost of unemployment insurance . In 1992 , unemployment-related expenditures amounted to 63 billion DKK , including transfer payments to the unemployed and retraining programs ( B rimichc- Olsen 1992 ; Madsen 1992 ) . As the number of long-term unemployed continued to rise , employment policy became more active and focused extensively on the supply side ( Economic Council 1994- , June ) . The state also tightened eligibility criteria to receive unemployment benefits , forcing the unemployed to prove that they were actively searching for new employment and engaged in supplementary education . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits to cost of living was stopped in 1983 . By the end of the 1980s , the real level of unemployment benefits in Denmark was the same as in the early 1970s . Since levels of social assistance and sickness benefits are tied to the unemployment benefit , dramatic cutbacks occurred in the Danish welfare state during the 198Os ( Greve 1993 , 73 ) . <p> Social policies were changed in the 1980s partly because it became apparent that existing techniques for combating unemployment were inadequate. 8 High unemployment suddenly seemed a permanent feature of Danish society . Consequently , attempts were made to reduce the size of the labor force . Initiatives were taken to encourage early retirement . Young people were placed in training and educational programs or in public employment projects ; some were assigned social benefits if they were deemed unable to work ( Economic Council 1994 ) . As a result , an increasing number of persons were no longer defined as a part of the labor force . <p> Financing such social services increasingly shiftcd from central to local government ( counties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building on spadework by their predecessors , conservative coalition governments replaced the old system , under which the central government reimbursed local governments for social service expenditures , with block grants . In 1986 , social service block grants accounted for 19 percent of central transfers to local governments . Four years later , thc figure was 24 percent ( Jorgensen and Pederscn I992 , 60 ) . This change in the financing social services was undertaken in the belief that prioritization of expenditures is best accomplished locally . But a block grant financing system made it easier for the central government to reduce general social allocations because local governments would havc to live with the consequences . Choices were made at local levels . Perhaps that explains why hospital capacity decreased during the I98OS while pupil per teacher ratios in primary and secondary schools generally improved ( Jorgcnsen and Pedersen I992 , 4-6-7 ) . In general , social transfer payments escalated during the I98OS as more people qualified for fewer and smaller benefits . While a classical liberal approach to social policy , it differed little from what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christiansen I99I ) . II <p> When the first conservative coalition came to power in autumn I982 , privatization was on the agenda . The new government was committed to reducing the state bureaucracy and viewed privatization as a means to achieve this goal . With a skeptical eye on the welfare state and faith in market forces , this Danish government paralleled the views of other conservatively led governments in Europe and the United States at the time including the beneficent effects of privatization . Privatization can mean the sale of assets , contracting out , user fees , voucher schemes , deregulation , and government withdrawal from public obligations . Danish conservatives favored the sale of assets , contracting out , and user fees . <p> No blueprint for privatization existed in Denmark in I982 , nor was any plan in the making . The first modernization report contains only general remarks about contracting out . Privatization in Denmark occurred in three phases : an initiation phase in 1982-83 , during which the government introduced proposals ; relative silence between 1984-87 ; and renewed interest between 1988-93 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiation phase , the government committed itselfideologically to privatization , but the initial plan was vague and concrete proposals were few ( Kristensen 1984 ) . The government focused on public tasks that might be handled by private businesses . The test case involved contracting-out measures . Although Denmark has had a long tradition of contracting out construction work to the private sector , contracting for social services was rare . The Social Democratic Party opposed any privatization of social services on the grounds that such reductions in public expenditures would very likely produce unacceptable inequalities . When they were joined by fierce critics in the trade unions , an unprepared government dropped the issue ( Kristensen 1987b ) . <p> In the second phase between 1984 and 1987 , the government concentrated on modernizing the public sector . The Minister of Finance , Palle Simonsen , a Conservative , was less critical of the public sector than his predecessor , a Liberal . Nevertheless , some initiatives were taken to control public expenditures including a review of budgeting in stateowned enterprises and publicity campaigns to convince Danes that citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees entered the popular vocabulary . <p> In December 1988 , the government committed itself with renewed vigor to the privatization issue in advance of preparing the national budget for 1989 . The ruling coalition reached agreement with Christian Democrats , Center Democrats , and the Progress Party to sell public buildings and government shares in private companies . A successful sale of 100 percent of the shares in the State Institute of Life Insurance in 1990 triggered plans for partial privatization of other state-controlled companies . The government wanted to sell off shares in the Copenhagen Airport , the Tele Company , the Postal Giro , and the Council for Export Credit . The typical objective was to place 25 percent of the shares in private hands , although the government hoped to sell 49 percent of the Tele Company . Contracting out also became a high priority during this phase . In 1991 , a government report encouraged managers of public institutions to entertain bids for necessary services and to select the most efficient and inexpensive offer received ( Ministry of Finance 1991 ) . The aim was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish a given task ( Ministry of Finance 1992d ) . The public bus company ( HT ) in Copenhagen was privatized by 45 percent . Garbage collection and hospital cleaning were contracted out in some instances . New user fees were introduced at colleges , universities , and public libraries . <p> Why did the Conservative-led coalition undertake such a fervid privatization process in the late 1980s ? One explanation is that the Social Democratic Party gave them an opening by acknowledging the value of competition in the public sector if there were reasonable and practical arguments in its favor . Immediately , the government shifted from ideological rhetoric promoting privatization to technical and pragmatic arguments about how private businesses were more flexible and efficient than traditional state enterprises . Second , Denmark had to adjust to EU market norms ( Olsen I993 ) . The implementation of the Single Market Act meant that state-owned companies and public institutions would have to face outside competition eventually . Third , effectively managed privatization would raise cash for the treasury without having to resort to taxation . In I99O , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22.5 billion DKK contracting out services ( Ministry of Finance I992a , 39 ) . While the conservative coalitions argued for privatization on ideological grounds and as a consequence of pressure to meet EU standards , neither actual conversions of state enterprises into company-law companies nor limited ventures in contracting out services to private businesses deviate radically from Social Democratic policies at the time . <p> When Prime Minister Schluter promised the electorate that conservative policies would make it " easier to be a Dane ; ' he meant that his government would tackle a public sector he considered too large , too bureaucratized , and too ignorant of the hopes and desires of ordinary citizens . In short , he promised in 1983 to modernize the public sector ( Eliason 1992 ) via reduction in size , improvements in services , and efficient use of resources ( Ministry of Finance 1983 ) . Despite annual reports to Parliament on the progress of the modernization program , the political tone of the reports and the heterogeneous nature of the program has made it difficult to evaluate . The general impression seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganization in the public sector ( Bentzon 1988 )  --  an impression we will examine by analyzing budget reform , introduction of management techniques from the private sector , attempts at debureaucratization , decentralization of decision-making , and inaugurating job flexibility in the public sector . <p> Budget reform in 1984 simplified many financial procedures used in public institutions . Reform also gave many public institutions flexibility to decide on specific expenditures within a given budget . Generally , excessive spending in any single budget line must be balanced by reductions in other lines ( Kjaersgaard 1994- ) . In addition , corporate management techniques were adopted for the public sector , such as upgrading the skills of chief executives and emphasizing actual outputs ( Ministry of Finance 1992c , 32 ) . In 1988 , the government announced a de-bureaucratization plan ( Prime Minister 's Office 1988 ) that included reducing the number of public rules and regulations and simplifying the remainder , merging public institutions , and privatizing some tasks . Although the outcome has have been viewed with some skepticism ( Gronnegaard-Christensen 1991 ) , as of 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented and only 20 percent were dropped altogether ( Ministry of Finance 1992c , 10 ) . <p> Decentralization was a major component in the strategy to reorganize the public sector . Some decision-making responsibility was transferred to local governments , where politicians have enhanced power due to the extended use of framework laws ( Albaek , 1993 ) . In 1985 , local government administrators were offered the opportunity to adapt statemandated services to local needs by relaxing compliance regulations . Twenty-two local governments decided to participate in this experiment and 384 local law exemptions were approved of by the Home Secretary in 1992 ( Ministry of Finance 1992c , 33 ) . Moreover , users of public institutions were able to exert direct infiuencc on the day-to-day operations . Meanwhile executive managers of public institutions have greater freedom to formMate strategies for future development . Public organizations such as the National Museum and the Danish Railways have achieved augmented planning capacity by negotiating budget agreements covering three to four years . Many experiments have resuited in changes to legislation . In addition , the public sector experimented with job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of achieving productivity gains of two to three percent per year . <p> These were all part of a responsive state strategy which aimed at increasing thc efficiency of the public sector and further integrating state and society . These initiatives coexisted with a marketization strategy that aimed at increasing market forces and competition within the public sector ( Sorensen and Torfing I993 ) . Among major coalition parmers , the Conservative Party promoted the responsive state strategy and the Liberal Party favored the marketizafion strategy ; the center parties tended to side with the Conservatives . Until 1987 , the govcrnment 's modernization reports were relatively evenhanded in its presentation of both strategies . But in 1988 , advocacy of user fees and citizen involvement outweighed pro-market rhetoric ( Sorensen and Torfing I993 , 38x ) . However , the 1991 and 1992 reports seesawed in favor of market competition in public sector . For example , the 1992 report was titled " Choosing Welfare " ( Ministry of Finance I992b ) , with an emphasis on stimulating competition between public and private institutions by having consumers choose services during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's parliamentary opponents were of different minds about these policies . On the right wing , the Progress Party pressed for more privatization and greater reduction in the public sector . On the left wing , the Socialist People 's Party bemoaned the resurrection of nineteenth-century , classical liberal ( " neo-liberal " ) tactics . Shuffling between the wings were Social Democrats who supported modernization in principle . In the late 1970s , the party had proposed various modifications in the public sector , some of which were incorporated in the conservative Budget Reform of 1984- . And at the end of that decade , all the Nordic Social Democratic parties supported modernization of the sort outlined in the Conservatives ' responsive state strategy ( The Social Democratic Party 1990 ) . In the early 1990s , the Conservatives eliminated all chance of a convergence with Social Democrats by adopting the Liberals ' marketization strategy . The coalition government fell , however , before marketization in the public sector could bc fully implemented . <p> The responsive state strategy was in effect long enough to have an impact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization efforts carried out under this banner ( cf. , Olsen 1989 and the Ministry of Finance reports ) . Although coalition politics and the heterogeneous character of the state discourage sweeping reform proposals ( Beck Jorgensen 1990 ) , many aspects of the conservative program were implemented , notably budget reform and corporate management techniques . The outcome of de-bureaucratization efforts is still unclear . While some regulations were simplified or eliminated , the new ones that were created probably resulted in little , if any change , in the overall amount of state regulation ( Gronnegaard-Christensen 1991 ) . If we judge the modernization program by its goals of containing public growth , providing a better service , and using resources more efficiently , its success is modest at best . The number of public employees increased from 619,600 in 1982 to 629,300 a decade later ( Ministry of Finance I992c , 1:2  --  3 ) , and the economic gains have been unimpressive ( State Auditors 1993 ) . Whereas decentralization probably increased the flexibility of public services , the drawbacks can be unequal treatment and unpredictability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization program undertaken by three Conservative-led coalitions did not constitute a major challenge to the Danish welfare state . We view it as a consolidation factor for a welfare state under mounting pressures , although the litmus test may be whether Danish perceptions of the public sector in the long run were changed in a conservative direction by the modernization program State Auditors 1993 , 1O4  --  6 ) . THE FAILURE OF A " NEO-LIBERAL " COUNTER-REVOLUTION <p> A Conservative-led coalition came to power in 1982 , fully intent on reshaping the welfare-state consensus that had prevailed in Denmark for half a century . They offered an alternative to Keynesian macroeconomics , reforms in social policies , and privatization and modernization of the public sector . But in the act of governing , pragmatic austerity and readjustment matters often overshadowed economic policy-making and implementation : Actual reductions in social transfers and serviccs were minimal . Relatively few public-sector reforms were implemented and their overall impact  --  despite some ideological reorientarion in thc general populace  --  rcmains uncertain . There was no " neo-liberal " counter-revolution in Denmark between 1982 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? The welfare state as provider of incomes , social and public services , and economic regulations has become strongly rooted in contemporary Denmark . In the best of circumstances , any government wishing to altcr the status quo faced an immense task . Actual circumstances were hardly propitious . First , the Conservative and Liberal Parties disagreed about which strategy to pursue . Second , the coalition as a whole was a minority government and often forced to compromise with its opponents . Third , organized interest groups such as trade unions and public-sector bureaucrats resisted changes in the existing welfare state ( Kristensen 1987b ) . Fourth , institutional structures in the Danish welfare state mitigated against major policy changes . <p> Disagreements within the coalition government were crucial obstacles to change , particularly regarding the fate of the public sector . Ironically , there was near unanimity on the desirability of liberating the country from Keynesian steering ambitions in order to make more room for a private market economy . Bringing down inflation was a top priority , and here the government succeeded . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on ccntral industrial policies or supply-side economics based on reductions in taxes and public expenditures . Parallel disagreements stymied radical attempts to reform the public sector . Conservatives insisted on a " responsive state strategy " while Liberals insisted on a " marketization strategy . " These two strategies have clashed at various points during the government 's rule , and this explains why the strategy towards reorganization of the public sector has not always been consistent . Eventually , Liberal electoral successes and Conservative losses gave increased weight to the marketization strategy . <p> Even if the coalition had successfully harmonized its internal disagreements , it never mustered the 90 seats required of for a majority . Table 1 shows that , whether as a result of negotiation or election , three successive coalition governments between 1982 and 1993 were minority governments : <p> In the absence of agreement between the Social Democratic and the Socialist People 's Parties , the center parties became swing votes for any minority government . Two Conservative-led coalitions had to contend with center parties that often wished to cooperate with Social Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last coalition ( Conservatives and Liberals only ) could pursue a more definitive bourgeois strategy , but it was still a minority government and did not have much success . Negotiation , cooperation , and compromise blunted the cutting edge of conservative reform efforts ( Eliason 1992 , 576 ) . <p> Trade unions , bureaucrats , and professionals working within the state also resisted fundamental alterations in the Danish welfare state . The labor unions , especially , distrusted a government that seemed to favor employers . Danish labor-market organizations have a long tradition of negotiation and corporatist bargaining , in which workers and employers recognize each other as equal negotiators who expect to be consulted when government bills are discussed , formulated , and implemented . Apart from some minor incidents , the coalitions avoided direct clashes with labor and corporatist bargaining remained intact . In the public sector , the government realized early on that it did not have the power to break the unions of state bureaucrats and professionals . Sincc the government depended on public employces to implement its modernization programs , policy development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional pressures were the third effective obstaclc to " neo4iberal " modifications of the Danish welfare state . <p> The fourth obstacle is the form of the welfare state in Denmark . As a universalist system , most Danes believe that they receive substantial returns on the high taxes they pay ( Korpi I983 ) . For example , even the rich receive child allowance four times a year . Actually , the middle classes benefit most from public services such as health care , libraries , and education ( Andersen and Christiansen 11991 ) . In other words , a universalist welfare system is itselfa deterrent of major welfare reform ; the irrcversibility thesis argues that it is nearly impossible to roll back the welfare state due to institutional and political factors ( Mishra 1990 ; Kristensen , 1987a ) . For the reasons outlined above , therefore , the Conservative-led governments between 1982 and 1983 were unable to change Danish society in a profound way . Thc welfare state consensus weathered the conservative wave . EPILOGUE <p> In 1993 , Prime Minister Schliiter was forced to step down when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Tamil case . " Legal hearings showed how the government had participated in erecting unlawful administrative obstacles to immigration appeals by Tamil refugees . In subsequent negotiations , the Social Democratic leader , Poul Nyrup Rasmussen constituted a coalition government with parties from the center . The first majority government in twenty years faces a number of constraints . Its majority is slim , indeed ; there have been defections on policy issues already . Despite apparent resolution of internal conflicts , the impression of a fragile majority remains . Meanwhile , Conservatives and Liberals are offended that they were not consulted on several important matters . The government has already carried out major reforms : lowering the marginal tax rates , introducing employment contributions , and increased flexibility in unemployment schemes . This indicates a high degree of political determination . Although the new government is committed to preserving the social security system , internal coalition disagreements may prevent promised moderate reforms in other aspects of the welfare state . The number of people heavily dependent on various sorts of transfer payments is increasing . Keynesian growth stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate from an active employment policy-may not solve the current unemployment problem . <p> There are also external pressures on the future development of the Danish welfare state . Chief among these is an ongoing convergence process within the European Union . According to the Maastricht Treaty , economic and monetary policies that prioritize price stability and low inflation take precedence over unemployment problems . Moreover , projected harmonization of national tax systems threatens the Danish social security system tied to a high value-added tax rate , high excise duties , high income tax rates , and low employment contributions . Harmonization of indirect tax rates would make it difficult to finance Denmark 's relatively high level of social security benefits because losses would be difficult to replace from current income tax receipts or from increases in employment contributions or environmental taxes ( Petersen 1991 , 522 ) . One can not rule out the possibility of business relocation and the resultant " social dumping " if differences between taxes and wage costs in Denmark and other EU are exacerbated , although other factors may be equally compelling in the interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I994- , I4- ) . <p> Finally , structural pressures brought on by technological innovation , internationalization , and transition to post-Fordist norms may invoke a shift from the Keynesian welfare state to a Schumpeterian workfare state ( Jessop 1993 ) . For example , the emergence of new core technologies based on the new information techniques modify existing industrial sectors and create new ones . In this day and age , mastery of the new technologies is critical to continual economic growth , especially that which is based on structural competitiveness ( 12 ) . Internationalization is the global flow of capital , commodities , labor , and knowledge across national borders to a degree that such national space becomes of marginal significance when considering structural competitiveness and economic growth . Keynesian demand-side management is rendered obsolete ( 13 ) . The transition from a Fordist growth model ( based on mass production , economies of scale , and mass consumption ) to a post-Fordist growth model ( based on flexible production , economies of scope , and specialized life-style consumption ) encourages policy makers to focus on supply side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cost efficiency and the creation of greater flexibility within the labor market 14-5 ) . The Schumpeterian workfare state is a paradigmatic response to these changes in the global economy ( n-e ) . The Kcynesian welfare state aims to promote full employment in a relatively closed economy through demand-side management and social policies motivated by redistributory efforts to generalizc Fordist consumption norms . By comparison , the SchumpeterJan workfare state aims to promote structural competitiveness in a relatively open economy through supply-side interventions and the subordination of social welfare policies to the economic demand for low costs and higher labor-market flexibility ( 9 ) . The Schumpeterian workfare state is just as committcd to securing the valorization of capital and the reproduction of the labor force as the Keynesian welfare state , but it aims to fulfill these basic functions in ways that accord with new core technologies , the consolidation of global growth dynamics , and the post-Fordist model ( 25-8 ) . <p> The Schumpeterian workfare state is likely to be less amenable than the Keynesian welfare state to government intervention in social and economic life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state : upward to ever-expanding supranational state systems , downward to ever stronger local governments , and outward to regional , cross-national linkages ( Jessop 1993 , 22-5 ) . Although these changes parallel and reinforce the internationalization pressures noted earlier , the shift from Keynesian welfare to SchumpeterJan workfare states is by no means ineluctable . Sufficient ambiguities exist for variations on both models that reflect " neo-liberal ; ' corporafist , and statist ideological commitments ( 28-33 ) . For example , the recent conservative coalitions in Denmark could be interpreted as examples of " neo-liberal " and statist strategies to cope with internationalization , whereas the Social Democratic coalition governments that replaced them appear to be pursuing statist strategies . During the years 1982-88 , the coalition government consisted of the Conservative Party , the Liberal Party , the Christian People 's Party , and the Democratic Center Party . In 1988-9o , the Christian People 's Party and the Democratic Center party dropped out of the coalition , whereas the Social Liberal Party joined . In 1990-93 , the coalition was composed of only two parties : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in formal indexation of the productivity growth rate and the growth rate in real wages . During World War II William Beveridge headed a commission in Great Britain which proposed expansion of state-run social , medical , and insurance schemes considerably beyond Bcveridgean welfare systems that had existed during the 1930s ( Flora and Alber 1982 , 57 ) . In the wake of the Beveridge Report , only Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries extended the scope of their public welfare schemes . By the 1960s , however , there was a growing convergence in welfare schemes , extent of coverage , and state funding . Such convergence justifies labeling all these welfare systems in western countries Beveridgean , despite differences among " liberal " welfare states in Australia , Canada , and the United States ; " corporatist-statist " welfare states in Austria , France , Germany , and Italy ; and " social-democratic " welfare states in Scandinavia and the Benelux countries ( see Esping-Andersen 1990 ) . The incompetence of Social Democratic minority governments has been exaggerated . For example , the combination of creeping devaluations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive effect on balance in the Danish economy ( see Rold Andersen 1984 , 14-6-9 ) . Welfare burden here denotes the public expense of public service and income transfer amounting to about 70 percent of the Gross Domcstic Product ( factor prices ) in 1982 ( Andersen and Christiansen 1991 38 ) . It is significant that most labor market services in Denmark are financed by income taxes and not , for example , as in Sweden and Germany , through the labor market itself . See Appendix A. Social policy and employment policy ( called labor market policy in Denmark ) are used interchangeably hereafter . Social policy includes income transfers and activities directed at those outside the labor force ; employment policy includes a wide range of policies towards the employed and the unemployed within the labor force . Social policy is organized within the public sector , whereas employment policy is institutionalizcd in cooperative organizations , with participation from government and the labor market organizations ( Andersen forthcoming ) . <p> Table 1 : Seats by Parties in the Danish Parliament I98I-93 ( Danish Parliament 1981 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
