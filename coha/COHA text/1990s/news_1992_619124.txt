<p> GET TO WORK , <p> AMERICA <p> Editor  --  1992 Resolution . Quit crying and start trying ! <p> I am sick and tired of all the crybabies out there in the good ' ol U.S.A. complaining about the economy . Where is the " can do spirit " we usually see from Americans ? <p> While the majority of the world is celebrating the rise of capitalism and the fall of communism , we Americans are moping and whining about how bad things are . <p> Get real ! Things are n't bad  --  just not great . If we want them to be great again , we have to start doing and thinking great things . <p> The dream of what America is all about is being celebrated by everyone around the world  --  except us . While it is wonderful the world has awakened to our dreams and ideals  --  it 's time we recommit ourselves to what we , the United States of America , are all about  --  freedom , hope , opportunity , chance , risk and reward . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's get going . Business people  --  start new ideas and concepts , take advantage of these great interest rates . Political leaders  --  wake up and get real , stop worrying about holding on to your office and just do your job . Become innovative and energetic . <p> None of this is nuclear science  --  all of it makes sense . <p> We have a chance  --  as Americans , to participate in this marvelous time in man 's history . We can show the world how our system works . Let 's stop watching and start participating . The rest of the world is waiting with open arms . Go for it America ! <p> TOM C. STICKEL <p> TCS Enterprises , Inc . <p> San Diego <p> BUY AMERICAN <p> Editor  --  It 's time as individuals and as businessmen that we stop waiting for government to cure all our economic ills , whether it be unemployment , the unskilled or the homeless . <p> The cure for most of these ills is " jobs "  --  American jobs . <p> Of course , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a liveable wage and a chance at the quality of life that it has taken us over 200 years to achieve . <p> However , the benefits are numerous for our country and for our people . When America is well , the world benefits . As an individual , I am willing to pay more for American products if it puts more Americans to work . <p> As a businessman , I will stop purchasing merchandise not manufactured in America . It 's time to take a stand , and I have . <p> ALEXANDER DOUGLAS <p> Nall &; Company <p> San Francisco <p> CAPTIVE MAMMALS <p> Editor  --  I would like to clarify my views concerning the treatment of whales in captivity . <p> Contrary to a recent article ( Chronicle , December 18 ) , I generally share the views of John Grandy , the representative of the Humane Society of the United States . The Marine Mammal Center does not support the capture of marine mammals from the wild for permanent display purposes . <p> Cetaceans ( whales , dolphins and porpoises ) , especially orcas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To remove them from this natural system to a captive environment is not in the best interest of the animals . However , for those animals already in captivity , it would be equally cruel to return them to the wild as the potential for rejection by cohorts would be high . <p> There is also serious concern about these animals ' foraging instincts and their immune systems ability to respond to disease challenges in the wild after the animal had been living out of the wild for a significant period of time . Facilities that keep marine mammals in captivity have a responsibility to develop captive breeding programs to eliminate the need to take healthy animals from wild populations . <p> PEIGIN BARRETT <p> Executive Director <p> Marine Mammal Center <p> Sausalito <p> ' CARMELIZATION ' <p> Editor  --  San Diego developers Thomas Kravis and Mauvourneen O'Connor are seeking Mendocino County Supervisors ' permission to create a 75-unit luxury resort a quarter-mile south of the historically designated Mendocino village on California 's North Coast . <p> Kravis and his wife , O'Connor , twin sister of San Diego 's mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their holdings is the Mendocino Campground , where they wish to create their resort . Kravis and O'Connor also own the Mendocino Hotel , comprising 19 percent of visitor serving accommodations in the Mendocino area . With the additional 75-unit resort they will control 47 percent of Mendocino 's units . <p> Last September , Mendocino County planning commissioners approved Kravis ' and O'Connor 's plan without requiring an environmental impact report and over the objections of Mendocino residents concerned also about the traffic , water availability , town congestion , degradation of an adjacent riparian area and septic disposal . <p> Residents and the state Department of Transportation appealed the planner 's decision to the county supervisors , requesting that the project be denied or at least an environmental impact report be required . The supervisors have now asked for an environmental impact report . <p> According to two local newspapers , officials from Governor Wilson 's office are alleged to have intervened with state agencies to push for approvals for the project . <p> Local residents have voiced concern for the size of the resort . They fear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms represent a 28 percent increase in the room supply . Sixty existing campground sites will be reduced to 45 according to Kravis and O'Connor . <p> Members of a local group opposed to the resort argue that the campground should be kept as is and refer to the 1972 Coastal Act 's provision mandating low-cost visitor servicing facilities . <p> " Residents for Mendocino " are also concerned with a trend toward non-resident ownership of the coast 's larger businesses . <p> JIM LOVERA <p> Residents for Mendocino <p> Mendocino <p> CITY 'S TREE CHOICE <p> Editor  --  Your editorial ( Chronicle , January 13 ) recommending further study of the palm trees proposed for The Embarcadero implies that insufficient consideration of other species options has occurred . <p> I would like to correct this misconception , since a great deal of professional review of numerous trees has taken place already . <p> First , the city 's paid consultants , Sasaki Associates , did a very thorough job of considering all of the possibilities for The Embarcadero and from a variety of perspectives including visual , environmental and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape architects and the staff from the Division of Urban Forestry considered the various possibilities , and also came to the same conclusion that the Canary Island Palm was the best choice given the constraints and attributes of The Embarcadero and the low- maintenance costs vis-a-vis Phoenix canariensis . <p> Finally , the Tree Advisory Board was asked to comment on the possibilities considered by the consultant and we also concluded that the Canary Island Palm was real issue in the public forum is not lack of careful consideration by some of the Bay Area 's most knowledgeable tree experts . <p> Rather , some San Franciscans are concerned ( and are apparently insecure ) about our image as a city and fear that palms are not a San Francisco tree . The Canary Island Palm , however , has been a feature of our city for at least 100 years . <p> The city has an opportunity to create a stunning , tree-lined boulevard for residents and visitors to admire and enjoy . The Canary Island Palm happens to be both the right choice horticulturally as well as visually for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our choice and miss the chance to enhance San Francisco 's unique character with a grand entryway to our city . <p> ISABEL WADE , chairperson <p> Tree Advisory Board <p> San Francisco <p> FOCUS ON REAL ISSUES <p> Editor  --  Get real Carole ! Carole Migden 's latest proposal to eliminate " dress codes " is another example of lunacy in government ! <p> I know her intentions are good , but she must be more realistic where businesses are concerned . Most business managers have the good sense to implement reasonable policies for their employees : and , most employees have the good sense to know what to wear to work ! The VDT legislation is bad enough . . . but this is ridiculous . <p> Perhaps if the Board of Supervisors had a better understanding of economics and what it takes to run a business ( remember , folks , this is what keeps our city running ! ) they would n't waste everyone 's time with these silly proposals . <p> There are certainly enough important , " real " issues out there . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned instead of making San Francisco look like the laughing stock of the country . <p> SHERRIE MATZA <p> San Francisco <p> PANHANDLERS ' NATION <p> Editor  --  At the height of his power , Napoleon mocked the English , calling them " A nation of shopkeepers . " <p> After President Bush 's recent performances in Tokyo , the Japanese probably regard us as " a nation of panhandlers . " <p> MICHAEL R. BRENNER <p> San Francisco
