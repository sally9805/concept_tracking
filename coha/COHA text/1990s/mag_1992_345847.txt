In the standoff between the government of President Najibullah and Afghanistan 's mujahedin , the beleaguered regime in Kabul is now clearly placing its hopes on a settlement brokered by the United Nations . Last week Najibullah tried to give that process a jog by publicly reiterating his longstanding offer to step out of the presidency and renounce any future political role as soon as a neutral interim government is formed under U.N . auspices . Said the President on national television : " I have agreed to transfer all authority to the transitional government . " <P> Najibullah 's latest concession to the peace process came shortly after a major mujahedin faction claimed that it had captured the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif , site of a government air base ; Kabul denied the claim . Hard- line mujahedin , ignoring the President 's offer , vowed to fight on .
