A woven rush seat is one of the most popular ways to finish a traditional rung-frame chair . Originally , a rush seat was woven with heavy strands made by twisting cattail leaves . If you do n't live near an area where cattails grow , however , you can still weave a seat . Pretwisted natural rush is available to make the job easier . For our chair , we chose fiber rush-a material made from heavy brown paper , twisted to form a strand . Fiber rush is a sturdy , long-lasting substitute that is almost indistinguishable from the real thing . Both natural and fiber rushes are available from Constantine , 2050 Eastchester Rd. , Bronx , NY 10461 . Fiber rush comes in various diameters . We used 5/32-in. - dia. rush for our average-size chair , while 3/16-in. rush would have been appropriate for a larger seat . The material comes in a coil and is ready to use-3 to 4 pounds should be enough for a typical chair . Seat Types The simplest seats to weave are those with rectangular or square frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the chair until the area has been filled ( see diagram on page 99 ) . However , most rung-style chairs , including the one we worked on , have a trapezoidal seat-that is , the front rung is longer than the back and the side rungs angle toward each other at the rear of the chair . To add the extra strands required on the longer front rail , triangular sections of the seat on each side are woven first . This is done with a number of separate strands that move down one side , across the front and up the other side . Some trapezoidal seats have corner square blocks at the front legs . These blocks equalize the rung length between front and back to allow the chair to be woven as if it were rectangular . Preparing The Chair Start by cutting away the old seat with a utility knife . Our chair had been woven with fiber rush and the starting strands were secured to the side rungs with tacks . Pull the tacks with a pair of pliers ( Fig. 1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to the rungs. // 1 2 // With the old seat removed , use a framing square , or large square piece of cardboard , to mark the extent of each triangular side section on the front rail . Hold one leg of the square in line with the back rail and against the rear leg , and make a pencil mark on the front rail ( Fig. 2 ) . Repeat on the other side . Weaving The Seat Cut a length of fiber rush to a little more than twice the length of the front rail . Dip the strand in warm water to dampen it ( Fig. 3 ) . Do n't soak the strand or the paper will quickly deteriorate . Then , use a small hammer to tack the end of the first strand to the left ( as you face the chair ) side rail ( Fig. 4 ) . If the original rush was tacked ir place , you can use the tack holes as placement guides . If not , tack the strand so that as it 's carried past the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the front rung . Next , pull the strand over the front rung . While holding it tight against the front leg , wrap it around and under the front rail , then up and over the left side rail ( Fig. 5 ) . Wrap the strand around and under the left side rail and carry it to the other side . Keep the strand tight . At the right leg , carry the strand over the top of the right rung , bring it underneath , then up and around the front rung next to the right leg ( Fig. 6 ) . Tack the strand to the right rung at the position that matches the spot where you started the strand on the left side . Cut away the excess . // 3 4 5 6 17 8 9 10 ll // 12 13 14 15 16 I7 On a square seat , weaving proceeds from one corner to the next until the area is filled . Each corner is woven in the same way-the strand first goes over and around a rung , then wraps around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front rung is longer than the back , the front corners are woven with separate strands . When the comers are filled , weaving proceeds as if the seat were square . // Now that the first strand is in place , repeat the process until the rush along the front rung reaches the pencil mark . Cut the next strand to estimated length and dampen it . Tack this piece in place on the left rung , placing the tack slightly farther up on the rung . Then , pull the strand across the front rung ( Fig. 7 ) , wrap it down and around the front rung , and up and over the side rung . Carry the strand to the opposite side , repeat the process ( Fig. 8 ) and tack it to the right rail . To get an idea on how to space the tacked ends , estimate how many strands it will take to reach the pencil mark on the front rung . This is the number of strands that must be spaced along and tacked to the side rungs . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front-to-back weaving perpendicular to the front rung , and the side-to-side strands parallel to the front rung . After you reach the pencil mark , you can weave as if the seat were square ( Fig. 9 ) . While you could weave the rest of the chair with one continuous length , it 's easier to work with shorter lengths , tying them underneath when necessary . Cut off a length equal to about 12 turns of your coil . Keep the length in its coiled shape and dip it in warm water to dampen it . Tack one end to the left rung near the back leg and weave it around both front legs in the manner described . However , instead of tacking it to the right rung , carry it over the back rail ( Fig. 10 ) . Then , bend it down and around the back rung , up and over the right side rung ( Fig. 11 ) and around and across to the left rung ( Fig. 12 ) . At the rear left leg , carry the strand over the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 13 ) . Continue weaving from one corner to the next . When you reach the end of the strand , simply tie a new one in place using a square knot ( Fig. 14 ) . As you progress , keep the strands tightly packed by tapping them together with a wooden block and a hammer ( Fig. 15 ) . Most rush seats are padded to add body and stiffness . Cut corrugated cardboard into shapes that will fit between the strand layers on each side of the seat ( Fig. 16 ) . Leave an opening at the middle of the seat . If the seat is wider than it is deep , you 'll end up with a space in the center of the front and back rungs when the sides are finished . To weave this space , simply carry the strand around the front rung , up the gap in the center and around the back rung ( Fig. 17 ) . Use a screwdriver to make space for the last few strands ( Fig. 18 ) . Repeat this figure-8 weaving until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot ( Fig. 19 ) . To protect the fiber rush , finish it with polyurethane varnish . // 18 19 // <p>
