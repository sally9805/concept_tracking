<p> TAKE a look at the 1991 Paraguayan telephone directory and there under " S " is the phone number of Alfredo Stroessner . <p> The listing is a bit of a surprise since General Stroessner has been unavailable to take calls for two years . A coup on Feb. 3,1989 , ended his 35 years as Paraguay 's generalissimo and dispatched him to exile in Brazil . <p> Look under " R , " and there is as yet no entry for Gen. Andr142s Rodriguez Pedotti , the man who led the coup and the country 's current president . It is , some say , an all-too-obvious sign of the political paralysis left by Stroessner 's iron-fisted rule . Opposition party leaders complain that Stroessner 's dominant National Republican Association-Colorado Party is still cemented in power . <p> " The Rodriguez coup basically happened to adapt the Stroessner system to modern times , " observes Rafael Saguier , a leading member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party ( PLRA ) , Paraguay 's main opposition party . " Stroessner was way out of date . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , some of them significant . <p> Gone , of course , are the ubiquitous , smiling portraits of Stroessner , used to promote a personality cult - and his political longevity . In his time , Stroessner was the longest-surviving head of state in the Western hemisphere . He came to power in May 1954 , when Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States , and nearly five years before Fidel Castro 's Cuban revolution . <p> The country 's main airport , formerly the Presidente Stroessner , has been renamed after Paraguay 's first pilot . And the second city , formerly ( you 've guessed it ) Presidente Stroessner , is now Ciudad del Este ( City of the East ) . <p> More important to Paraguayans , General Rodr146guez has broken with tradition and promised to hand power to an elected successor in August 1993 . In 180 years of post-independence history , no president has ever given the sash to the opposition by way of the ballot box . <p> Coaxed along by his regular tennis partner , US Ambassador Timothy Towell , Rodriguez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . A notable exception has been his harsh treatment of peasant protesters . <p> Yet opposition politicians accustomed to plotting from exile or prison now openly criticize the regime - without getting arrested . The press has also been unmuzzled . <p> " The Rodriguez government has achieved 20 percent of what it promised . Its worst error is that the process of democratization has n't been planned , " says Euclides Acevedo , head of the opposition social-democratic February Revolutionary Party . " The protagonists of the democratic process , the popular movement and social organizations , have not been asked to take part . Everything remains in the hands of the government and the Colorado Party . " <p> Although the opposition is outspoken , its effectiveness has been hampered by the tendency of parties to devolve into grupitos - small groups where personal ambition far outweighs ideological or policy differences . <p> Two Paraguayan political sociologists interviewed about party splits spent an hour arguing whether the governing Colorado Party had broken into nine or 10 factions . The main opposition party , the PLRA , also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the Christian Democratic Party , with just 3,000 members , is split into four distinct groups . <p> What has not changed is the pervasive corruption . " Corruption threatens our nation and those who want to construct a really democratic state , " says Domingo Laino , of the PLRA . ( See related story ) . <p> " The people at the top have changed , but not the system , " agrees Esther Prieto , director of Paraguay 's Center for Humanitarian Studies , a human rights group . " The new clique has got hold of the possessions of the old one . " GUSTAVO SABA , who is married to Rodriguez 's second daughter , Mirtha , is now owner of Channel 9 , the country 's largest television chain , formerly owned by Stroessner 's elder son , Gustavo . And the talk on the streets and in Western embassies is that Gen. Humberto Gacete , the current head of the Army , has the new lease on the luxury Hotel Guarani in downtown Asuncion - which was also Gustavo Stroessner 's . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says a Western diplomat . <p> " There 's plenty of historical precedents for this , " says Line Bareiro , a senior researcher at the Center for Documentation and Studies , a political research group . " When new rulers emerge in Paraguay , they take over the ranches and other possessions of the people they ousted . " <p> Generals close to Rodriguez are also accused of joining Paraguay 's class of large landowners in a country where land ownership is skewed , even by Latin American standards . The last agrarian census in 1981 showed less than 1 percent of property holders own more than three-quarters of the cultivable land . Between 60,000 and 100,000 peasant families are landless , making land tenure an explosive issue . <p> Since Rodriguez 's coup , nearly 3,000 peasants have been detained for short periods as a result of 179 land occupations by the peasants . Six peasants have been killed . <p> Roman Catholic Bishop Mario Medina 's efforts to find land for about 1,000 parishioners have been stymied by one of the new generals . A $4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services for peasants has also been held up because the state 's agrarian reform institute , the IBR , has been unable to come up with land to put up as Paraguay 's contribution . <p> When Monsignor Medina made inquiries about the land to IBR officials , he was told that Gen. Lino Oviedo , the new head of the first cavalry regiment and a key player in Rodriguez 's coup " was taking wood out of the zone , " Medina says . <p> The land previously was part of the empire of Gen. Alcibiades Britez , Stroessner 's ex-chief of police , who lawyers say owns 250,000 acres of land and 80 mansions . <p> " The reason why the IBR can not provide the land is that the land belongs to the ' untouchables ' - great friends of the people in power , " complains Medina . " In Paraguay , if someone is a friend , you have to save him . But if he 's an enemy , you have to ruin him . That practice still persists . "
