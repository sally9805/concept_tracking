<p> THE death of chintz  --  arrivederci , baby  --  will be made public next week at the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Showhouse , where it will also be revealed that the bridge to the 21st century is really an 800-pound concrete Zen bathtub . <p> It 's show house time again , that rollicking seasonal decorating ritual in which a heady eau d'affluence fills the air and $100,000 gilt clocks ting in unison on the quarter hour . <p> Strange as it may seem , however , a sort of Kips Bay Liberation Front has taken up residence at 32 East 70th Street , a comparatively swag-free environment this year with a lower-than-usual knicknack quotient , where the work of 20 designers  --  a record eight of them first-time Kips Bayers  --  goes on view from May 5 through May 27 . <p> In the past , the show house has been predominantly a starched bastion of Park Avenue decorating , pure Brooks Brothers , a place where breathless decorators used words like " timeless " and " eclectic " to describe the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possible extinction by Martha Stewart ) , the predictable Kips Bay has turned bracingly unpredictable this year , as many designers up the ante to redefine what " good taste " means as the year 2000 approaches . <p> They are looking to remote nonwestern cultures , humble materials , Popsicle-color palettes  --  and the feel of the human hand . They are perfecting the Deepak Chopra School of Decorating , viewing interiors as " a meditative state " ( Kitty Hawks ) and a " life-enhancing situation " ( Clodagh ) . <p> Liza Cousins and Natasha Bergreen painted a wall in the 30-room 1912 mansion with henna , inspired by mehndi , the ancient Indian art of body painting . Eve Robinson , 33 , a designer new to Kips Bay , took a love of common objects , specifically the apple basket , and reinterpreted the conventional paneled room with a basket-weave wall of interlaced maple strips . In the nothing-is-sacred department , David Kleinberg , an architect , brazenly enveloped Regency antiques and a $15,000 thin-screen television in a room of pinstriped burlap ( save those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessory , and it sprouts from steel ledges ( Clodagh ) and bathtubs ( Ms. Robinson ) , raising the question of whether venture capitalists ought to be investing in hand-held indoor lawn mowers . <p> In Clodagh 's mystically sybaritic sanctuary , light emanates mysteriously through sauna-like wooden slats , and crystals dangle beside the doors . Fittingly for an era in which it is difficult to tell where National Geographic ends and Elle Decor begins , an antique Nepalese ox cart wheel hangs on an artisanal-plaster wall . Pebbles and Bam-Bam have gone spiritual and joined an ashram . It is decorating as trekking . Who needs Nepal ? <p> Around the show house , there was a sense that Kips Bay had finally embraced a younger generation of designers and clients , in part because of the unseen hand of Alexis Contant , 33 , the new marketing director and one of five people on the top-secret anointing committee . <p> Standing in his chocolate brown and deep Prussian blue room the other day  --  decorated down to a dish of color-coordinated M &; M 's  --  Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm Irvine &; Fleming , took stock of how far his generation of decorators has come . <p> " We were schooled in the English country house , which swept down Park Avenue like a tidal wave , " he said . " Now there is all this yummy new Wall Street money around . But young clients today want luxurious combinations of things , simple luxe , not a literal translation . " <p> Even experienced designers like Noel Jeffrey , now appearing in his eighth show house , are practicing extreme decorating  --  in his case , transforming a fusty English-style mahogany-paneled library by fearlessly colorizing it with tailored chartreuse-and-orange silk taffeta draperies and furniture covered in violet , emerald , apricot and orange silk . <p> His room is awash in 20th-century classics , from a yellow swirling 1950 's lamp of Murano glass to a lacquered chair by Jean Dunand , the Paris Art Deco master whose exquisite metalwork and lacquer artistry will be on view next month at the Metropolitan Museum of Art . <p> Mr. Jeffrey described the current taste as " opulent minimalism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a style he , too , attributed to the economy . " In the 1970 's , " he said , " there was a major recession and high-tech minimalism was in vogue . In the 1980 's , there was a major boom , and more was better . You could n't show off your wealth by putting two things on a table . " The current decade started with a recession , he pointed out , but now there 's a boom again . The result is minimalism combined with what he calls " dazzlingly opulent " colors and materials . Art Deco and other 20th-century periods yet unnamed are being resurrected . <p> " The really good 20th-century designs were clean , " he said . " There was no ormolu , no curvy legs , just extremely elegant details with beautifully finished wood . " <p> Make no mistake : Decadence is alive and well , as the abundance of $600-a-yard silks and $50,000 killer chandeliers attests ( the subtitle of the Kips Bay show could be " The Borrowers " ) . <p> As Richard Mishaan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who combined Romeo Gigli fabric with Philippine tribal sculpture , put it , " When they talk about paring down , they 're not talking about money . " <p> Nevertheless , the trend was toward cross-shopping , a breezy juxtaposition of the High and the Low . And in these rarefied quarters it felt subversive , especially among the younger decorators , who dared  --  in the very same room  --  to use antiques along with objects from Ikea , Pottery Barn and other places associated with " the common man " ( as Katina Arts-Meyer , one of the decorators , who has curated the Queen 's bronzes , put it without a trace of irony ) . <p> In a drawing room that confirmed that this year , darling , it 's orange , Keller Donovan , 39 , combined an orange plastic clover-shaped table from Ligne Roset , produced since 1976 , with botanical prints and flaming orange $1.98 Ikea candles . The overall effect rivaled Prozac 's as a mood elevator . " I 'm tired of opulence , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms should include objects of all prices . Everything is valid . " <p> Matthew Smyth , too , mixed metaphors in a paneled manly bedroom furnished with a Georgian secretary and Lucite night stands , among other things . Regency chairs with cracked leather seats coexisted peacefully with a $240 lamp from Gracious Home . " Ten years ago , " Mr. Smyth , 39 , noted , " you would n't have run to Crate and Barrel to get a lamp for a $50,000 desk . But if it 's appropriate , the cost does n't matter . More was more . Now more is less . " <p> The techniques , too , felt down to earth , despite the fact that decorators are genetically coded to advise people that do-it-yourself equals disaster . <p> Overwrought murals and trompe l'oeil have not entirely disappeared from the horizon ( Exhibit A : the wall mural " Equestrian Ascension , " a morphing of Tiepolo and Precious Moments porcelain figurines in the fifth-floor stair hall ) . But on the hall below , the Alpha Studio , a decorative arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish by potato-printing lavender and sage patterns on the gold-leaf-paper wall . The use of potatoes as an art medium created a sari-like effect that looked like rich embroidery . <p> The East  --  and the third world  --  were major influences : for the first time at Kips Bay , India , Africa and Morocco seemed as influential as Versailles . The more-primitive-than-thou accessories were typified by the African headrests Ms. Hawks had placed on a Danish rosewood desk and by Clodagh 's use of sugar-cane presses as night stands . <p> In a luxuriously layered room , Ms. Hawks looked to Japanese kimono patterns for inspiration , rubber-stamping pinstriped curtains with leaves , birds and other motifs ( using " ordinary house paint , " she said ) . The walls were randomly decorated with shimmery hand-painted designs also inspired by Japanese clothing that gave the effect of indoor snowflakes falling quietly . <p> The more traditional opulent rooms , though dazzling , have begun to look like holdovers from another era . As Ms. Robinson pointed out in explaining her simple , elegant basket-weave wall , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life we make our lives less chaotic . " <p> Among other points of interest : <p> * Most Pretentious Detail : Latin inscriptions on painted cabinets in Beverly Ellsley 's otherwise charming kitchen . <p> * The High-Roller-Suite Look-Alike Award : Michael de Santis 's Lair of the White Lion , in which a niche is festooned with lacquered white wooden lions ' heads . <p> * The Susan Faludi Backlash Award : Charles Damga 's froufrou-infested girl 's bedroom , swagged to the hilt , with white teddy bears and a mirror big enough for Narcissus  --  but no room to play . The cost of long-term psychotherapy should be included in the decorator 's fee . <p> * Next Political Cause : sanctions against room scents . <p> * Most Useful Items : Excedrin and Tums , displayed in beakers in Ms. Robinson 's bathroom . <p> * Most Important Show House Accessory : the blank checkbook , spotted in Richard Keith Langham 's study . <p> The 26th Annual Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Showhouse , a benefit for the club , in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 32 East 70th Street .

What Price Good Taste ( in an 11 1/2-by-12 1/2-Foot Room ) ? $1.2 Million <p> Come the revolution , Michael Simon 's " private domain for a wine connoisseur " may be the first to fall . The 2,200-piece onyx-and-marble plaid floor was inspired by the entry hall at the Chateau de Champ-de-Bataille , but that floor , Mr. Simon said , is " not nearly as complicated as this one . " For a genuine Louis XVI drawing room , 11 1/2 by 12 1/2 feet , the price tag was $1.2 million , or $8,333 a square foot . Here 's l'addition , brick by gold brick . PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN Decorator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of does n't have to come at a price that wakes you up , screaming . At the Kips Bay decorator show house , the pros were cross-shopping . <p> For his library , Noel Jeffrey upholstered a club chair in deep-purple silk velvet that costs $570 a yard . " The colors of silk velvet are richer than cotton , " he said . But Mr. Jeffrey also chose a wooden tray from Pottery Barn ( under $50 ) to hold a moss landscape created by his favorite florist . <p> Keller Donovan , in his artist 's " drawing " room , laid limestone on the floor . But he framed giveaway paint chips ( inset , below left ) as art for the wall . Behind glass in a halo of pristine white , they are a dead ringer for a modernist collage . <p> Is it possible to find less expensive alternatives to the luxe materials , from marble to silk , that the designers chose ? From Orchard Street to Bed , Bath and Beyond , here 's show-house style for at-home prices . MARIANNE ROHRLICH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used purple silk velvet from Manuel Canovas .
