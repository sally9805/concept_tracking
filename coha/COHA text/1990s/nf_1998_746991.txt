A set of inner and outer brush seals capable of bidirectionally restricting flows in a wave rotor has been successfully fabricated and tested . <p> IF THE PERFORMANCE goals for advanced gas turbines are to be achieved by conventional means , increasingly difficult thermal demands on materials will have to be met and high overall pressure ratios will be required . Unconventional techniques , such as pulsed combustion and wave rotor topping cycles , have been suggested . However , the achievement of high efficiency through these means will depend on the ability to control leakage losses by means of adequate sealing . <p> Pulsed combustion can result in combustion with a pressure gain . A wave rotor topping cycle , which can also be thought of as pressure gain combustion , appears to generate higher pressure ratios than pulsed combustion currently does , and so is more attractive . Fuel ratercooling and wave rotors could be used in conjunction in the same engine to enhance performance . <p> A wave rotor machine uses expansion and shock waves within rotating passages on the rotor to accomplish the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding or compressing the working fluid . In the wave rotor machine both compression and expansion occur , and in some cases chemical reactions take place . Advantages cited for the wave rotor include enhanced efficiency , rotor material temperatures lower than the peak gas temperatures , lower speed rotation with reduced stress , simple robust construction , and rapid transient response . <p> Sealing can be a major factor in the wave rotor , and the seal is dynamic . The leakage takes place into or out of a passage through the gap between the passage and the end walls of the machine . The leakage flow changes direction , depending on whether the passage is at high or low pressure . These end wall losses can potentially be controlled by seals such as the compliant brush configuration or the close self-activating rim or leaf seals . Because brush seals could be incorporated easily into an existing three-port wave rotor at NASA Lewis Research Center , bidirectional seals were used . Tests were made of wave rotor performance with and without the brush seals . The results of these tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig at NASA Lewis has a three-port flow divider . A single inlet flow is separated into two outlet flows , one at a higher stagnation pressure than the inlet and the other at a lower stagnation pressure . The high-pressure air exhausts from the duct in the center . The rotor itself is a cylinder with axially aligned passages on its circumference . As a passage rotates , the pressure at the ends of the passage fluctuates between the high and low pressures . The cavity surrounding the rotor will be at a pressure close to the inlet pressure . Leakage will take place from the passage to the cavity when the passage is at high pressure , and from the cavity to the passage when the latter is at low pressure . Thus , the seals must be capable of withstanding pressure reversals and the corresponding flow reversals . <p> A cross-sectional view of the rotor ( on the facing page ) shows the cavities and placement of the brush seals . The rotor passage represents that portion of the rotating cylinder which contains the working fluid ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The movable end wall can be adjusted for a desired setting for the size of the gap between the rotor and the end wall . Without seals , the leakage is proportional to the size of these gaps . <p> There are 60 passages , each 1.37 centimeters ( 0.54 inch ) wide , spaced about the circumference of the rotor . As the rotor turns , the pressure at each end of the passage varies , with the highest pressure being about three to four times that of the lowest . The cavity pressure is nearly the average of the two . The function of the seals is to prevent leakage from the cavities into the rotor passage and vice versa . The leakage may be thought of as composed of radial and circumferential components . Circumferential leakage is from passage to passage where the pressure differences are not large , so this leakage is believed to be less important than radial leakage . While this circumferential leakage could have been moderated somewhat by swirl brakes , only the brush seals were considered , which had little effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cavity , and then from the cavity back into a low-pressure passage . By blocking the path from the passages into the cavity , brush seals can reduce the radial leakage . BRUSH SEAL REQUIREMENTS <p> The wave rotor represents an unusual set of operating conditions for a brush seal . In addition to the usual compliance and sealing requirements , the brush must be capable of sealing bidirectional flows and of sealing pressures to +/- 276 kilopascals ( +/- 40 lbs . per square inch ) . The brush pair must seal the interface at both the inside and outside diameters . Both ends of the wave rotor must be sealed ; that is , matching pairs of seals are required , and they must be retrofitted into the existing equipment with minimum modifications . The surface speeds , to 152 meters per second ( 500 feet per second ) , and environmental temperatures , to 177 Celsius ( 350 Fahrenheit ) , are modest design requirements for a brush seal . <p> After some consideration , it was decided that the shielded design could be modified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced between each side plate and the bristles . The brush was otherwise of standard construction , by the Cross Manufacturing Co . ( Devizes , England ) . The bristles were 0.071-millimeter- ( 0.0028 inch ) diameter Haynes 25 ( AMS 5796 28 ) , at angles of 40 to 50 degrees to the interface and inclined in the direction of rotation with suitable antirotation pins . The rotor inner seal radius was nominally 140.2 mm ( 5.518 inches  --  5.5167 left and 5.5192 right ) after testing , and the rotor outer seal radius was nominally 162.1 mm ( 6.380 inches  --  6.3747 left and 6.3803 right ) after testing . In each case , 0.25 mm ( 0.010 inch ) radial interference was built into the as  --  manufactured seal . <p> The rubbing interfaces were Proxair ( Union Carbide ) LC-1H chromium carbide coated to 0.15 to 0.25 mm ( 0.006 to 0.010 inch ) thickness . <p> After the wave testing was completed , the outside-diameter and inside-diameter seals were examined carefully . The brushes were found to be in good condition , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush . <p> The brush seals were installed by rotating them into position ( that is , in a direction opposite the rotor 's rotating direction ) . Suitable static O-rings provided the necessary static seals . The rotor was torqued by hand to set the bristles . In a set of break-in runs , the speed was increased in increments of 650 rpm from 1000 to 7500 rpm at nominal one-hour intervals ( for 10 hours ) with unheated inlet air . A similar schedule was used with the inlet air heated to 49 Celsius ( 120 Fahrenheit ) , for 7.5 hours , with an additional 5 hours of preliminary testing . Once the bristles were set and rubbed into place , a borescope examination of the bristles revealed the characteristic powder debris in flow stagnation regions . The remainder was swept away with the flow . Some bristles strayed beyond the pack ; those of the inner seal were most susceptible . Little evidence of unusual bristle dispersion was found , with the exception of an isolated tuft pullout . <p> The system was operated for a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature was approximately the inlet temperature , 49 Celsius ( 120 Fahrenheit ) , with hotgas temperatures to 129 Celsius ( 264 Fahrenheit ) and cold-side temperatures to 11 Celsius ( 51 Fahrenheit ) . RESULTS <p> A measure of the performance of a three-port wave rotor is the efficiency , defined as <p> h = ( b/ ( 1- b ) ) . ( Phi/Pin ) ( g-1 ) /g- 1 ) / ( 1- ( Plo/Pin ) ( g - 1 ) /g ) <p> where Pin is the inlet stagnation pressure , Phi the stagnation pressure in the high-pressure outlet , Plo the stagnation pressure in the low-pressure outlet , and b the ratio of mass flow in the high-pressure outlet to total mass flow . Higher values of both Phi/Pin and Plo/Pin will result in higher efficiency . Reducing leakage will create higher values of system pressure . <p> The wave rotor efficiency is a function of the size of the gap between the end wall and the rotor for b = 0.37 and Plo/Pin = 0.6 . The brush seals were effective in increasing efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the experiment the gap size was altered and the associated wave rotor efficiencies measured . To enable a direct comparison , tests were run with and without the brush seals . On average , the brushes diminished the leakage by a factor of two . At a large gap spacing , the brush seals have a very pronounced effect . However , at small spacings there is less effect on efficiency and pressure . <p> Although the bristles wore significantly and some tufts were disheveled to the point of permitting rivering ( a condition in which bristles are pushed aside and leakage flows like a river ) , both sets of brushes did not appear to deteriorate further with time . But the testing lasted only for 19 hours and 54 minutes  --  far less than the thousands of hours necessary for an engine application . The nominal operating interferences ( radial ) were 0.1.5 and 0.23 mm ( 0.006 and 0.009 inch ) for the outside-diameter and inside-diameter brush seals , respectively . <p> The core has a surface resembling a cast-iron fracture . The core is rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material transfer . No metallurgical analysis has been performed , as the brush is preserved for further flow testing . Only marginally visible are grooves and ridges scratched across the tips in the direction of rotation . Typically , there will be 15 to 20 visible scars . With a diameter of 0.071 mm ( 0.0028 inch ) , each scar is perhaps 4 micrometers ( 150 millionths of an inch ) wide with transfer material scattered over the surface . <p> Attempts to quantify the surface wear were unsuccessful . From surface measurements we know , however , that the chromium carbide interface coating wore less than 0.025 mm ( 0.001 inch ) on all four interfaces . By optical inspection , however , polishing/burnishing of the interfaces could be readily observed . A closer examination of these tracks reveals " skipping , " or changes in hardness , which may represent tool marks of the parent machining operation or changes in the chromium carbide coating . The " spottiness " of the wear scar may be related to bristle bunching combined with sharp pressure changes and a fluttering motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark bands or car tracks on either side of the wear scar could be a result of bristle stiffening near the fence plate during one portion of the rotor cycle and against the gap plate during other portions of the rotor cycle . Bristle natural frequency affects bristle movement and fluid flows in the cavities between the bristles and the back plates ; further work on defining the back plate and rotor interface geometries is required . <p> No definitive tests were undertaken during the break-in stage or during the testing ; thus , one can only conclude that the bristles wore significantly , and the rotor coating showed little evidence of tracking other than being highly polished with some spottiness . Some powder debris was found in the exhaust port . <p> A set of inner and outer brush seals capable of bidirectionally restricting flows has been successfully fabricated and tested . The brush seals represented an extension of the side plates with sufficient gap to permit compliance . <p> The wave rotor efficiency improvement due to the brush seals was more pronounced for the largest end wall gap ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals ) , and to a lesser extent for the smallest end wall gaps ( rising from 36 percent without seals to 45 percent with seals ) where the leakages become quite small . On average , the leakages with brush seals were half those of the gap-controlled baseline configuration . <p> The optical microscope revealed bristle tip grooving . Material transfer was inferred from the fracture-like appearance of the bristle tips of the outside-diameter brush bristles . Bristle tips for the inside-diameter brush were similar , except that no grooving was evident . The coated rotor appeared polished without distress with the exception of car-track wear scars and bristle whipping , or bristle-bunch incursion loading marks , which may be related to residual tooling or surface hardening in the parent rotor material . Inner and outer wear tracks , like car tracks , may be the result of bristle stiffening at the fence plate during part of the rotor cycle and stiffening at the gap plate during other parts of the rotor cycle . Small pressure perturbations may cause bristle flutter during the lightly loaded portion of the cycle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back plates and requires better definition of back plate geometries . <p> For the limited test time and operating conditions , the rotor surface appeared polished , the bristles did wear in , and the brush seals provided enhanced efficiencies over the base line . <p> The principles of bidirectional brush design can be applied to all brush configurations , providing bidirectional capability , controlled seal stiffness/damping , bristle spread , flutter , protection from foreign object damage , and a double labyrinth-orifice at essentially the same cost as a conventional brush seal construction . <p> This article is adapted from a technical paper ( 97-GT-256 ) presented at the 1997 International Gas Turbine &; Aeroengine Congress D Exhibition in Orlando . <p> Rotor cross section shows the cavities and placement of the brush seals . <p> By Robert C.
