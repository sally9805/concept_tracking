<p> CHAPEL HILL , N.C.  --  Thirty-two years ago , during one of his early seasons as men 's basketball coach at the University of North Carolina , Dean Smith was hanged in effigy . <p> Thursday , they were begging him to stay as he made official his surprise resignation . <p> Smith 's departure gives new meaning to Carolina blue . Outside the Dean E. Smith Center , students had written in chalk on the sidewalk , pleading for him to stay . There was a frowning face on the big sign in front of Sutton 's Drug Store downtown : " Dean , old friend . . . Please say it ai n't so . " <p> It 's so . <p> El Deano , 66 , is retiring after 36 seasons , a college-record 879 wins and 27 consecutive 20-win seasons , two NCAA championships , 11 trips to the Final Four , one Olympic title and a 97.3% graduation rate . <p> His replacement : Bill Guthridge , 60 , Smith 's assistant for 30 years , who will receive a multiyear contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe it , " said point guard Ed Cota , summing up the reaction of players and fans about Smith 's retirement . <p> Smith explained his reasons Thursday at a news conference attended by the team ; former players , such as Scott Williams of the Philadelphia 76ers ; and former assistants , including 76ers coach Larry Brown and Georgetown 's John Thompson , who was part of Smith 's 1976 Olympic staff . <p> First , Smith put to rest rumors : No , he received no bad news after a recent physical , although he needs to exercise more . No , he is n't feuding with chancellor Michael Hooker or new athletic director Dick Baddour . <p> The timing of his decision is consistent with statements in recent years that he would decide whether to continue to coach based on his feelings in August , September or October , not by his usual drained state at the end of the college basketball season in April . <p> " Every year for the last eight or so , I 've thought it might be time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy basketball . I enjoy coaching basketball . It 's the out-of-season things I have n't handled so well . " <p> Smith said that between Oct. 15 , 1996 , and May 18 he took off just one weekend to spend with his family , which includes his wife , Linnea , five children and four grandchildren . <p> " In my opinion , " Guthridge said , " it 's all the little things that wore Dean out . Will you sign this autograph , make this appearance . . . " <p> The fire was subsiding <p> Smith felt invigorated diagramming plays recently with his staff , as well as ex-assistants Roy Williams of Kansas , Eddie Fogler of South Carolina and Brown . But he also was struck by something while watching Brown run the 76ers ' training camp at the Dean Dome , as the Smith Center is known , on the Carolina campus . <p> " Larry Brown always fires me up , " Smith said . " I said , ' I used to be like that . ' If I ca n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . That 's honestly how I feel . " <p> In September , Smith told high school stars such as Jason Capel , who said he will attend UNC , that he would not be their coach as seniors , believing he 'd retire when his contract expired in 2001 . <p> But late last week Smith said he became 80% sure he was on his way out . He broke the news to the team Wednesday in the locker room . He left as he started to cry , leaving players who were sobbing . <p> He teared again Thursday as he referred to the players and former coaches attending the news conference : " What loyalty I 've had . " <p> With the timing of the announcement , Smith also ensured he could exert greater influence on the choice of his successor . With practice starting Oct. 18 , there 's no time for a search . <p> Williams , Fogler , Brown and George Karl , an ex-Carolina player who coaches the NBA 's Seattle SuperSonics , were thought to be the leading candidates to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult role falls to the man who , for more than half his life , has been seated at the right hand of the Dean on the Tar Heels ' bench . The man the players call " Coach Gut " has turned down several head coaching jobs , including Arkansas twice and Penn State in 1978 . <p> He was n't seeking his current post : " I was hoping Dean and I would ride into the sunset together in five or six more years . . . . This year , if you see me with about two minutes left in the game get out my little portable phone , I 'm calling Dean to say , ' What do we do now ? ' " <p> Guthridge inherits six regulars from last year 's 28-7 team that reached the Final Four . <p> " Coach Gut is the best person for the job , " said 6-9 Antawn Jamison , who last year averaged a team-high 19.1 points . " It 's like losing your father but having him replaced by your uncle . It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come close to his accomplishments or be at the same level . " <p> Guthridge could n't agree more . Nobody has a coaching genealogy like Smith , who played at Kansas for Phog Allen , who played for James Naismith , the inventor of the game . Thus , Smith 's coaching tree extends from creation to the present . <p> His innovations , including the four-corners offense  --  which spreads the offense and is effective in late-game situations  --  or foul-line huddle became staples of the college game . <p> And there wo n't be many 36-year tenures in today 's free-agent atmosphere , where big names alternate between lucrative college and pro jobs , or with the win-or-else realities of big-time athletics . <p> There was never a hint of scandal around Smith . <p> " I did it on my own terms , " Smith said . " That means you 're not fired in coaching . " <p> He did more than avoid what coaches call the " ziggy . " He left the program in good shape and in the hands of his preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a coach with a social conscience , participating in mid- ' 60s sit-ins to integrate Chapel Hill . <p> Of his $ 1 million-a-year financial package , he said , " We 're totally overpaid . " <p> When Nike signed him to a contract , he made sure other sports were taken care of and funneled $ 300,000 a year to the school . <p> An unplanned retirement <p> True to his family-style management , he 's been busy contacting players ' families to explain his decision . " There was some guilt , " he said . " But I still believe it 's best for them . " <p> Smith said he plans to act as a consultant to the school in a role that needs defining , catch up on correspondence and play golf . " I know I ca n't play golf every day , " he said , " especially the way I 'm playing now . " <p> By suddenly retiring , Smith is violating the advice of his wife , who once wrote a medical paper about post-retirement depression . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith said . " I did n't . " <p> But the sudden decision gets him out of something that would n't be his style , a farewell tour . <p> " Can you imagine all the rocking chairs ? " he said . " And ( people ) acting like they like you ? " <p> Smith leaves without lacking fans or accomplishments . <p> Smith 's record as UNC coach <p> Dean Smith joined the University of North Carolina as an assistant basketball coach under Frank McGuire in 1958 . When McGuire left to become head coach of the NBA 's Philadelphia Warriors in 1961 , Smith succeeded him .
