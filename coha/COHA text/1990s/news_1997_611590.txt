<p> For a generation of grass-roots activists , the advocacy group Citizen Action became a liberal refuge in the late 1970s as the civil rights and anti-war movements waned and conservatism gained strength in American politics . <p> The group was " a transmission belt for New Left liberals " who did not identify with either political party , as one sympathetic union official put it . With meager funding and an extensive volunteer network , it protested plant closings , toxic waste sites and high energy costs . <p> Last year , with a huge surge in donations from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the AFL-CIO , Citizen Action ventured boldly into mainstream politics . It worked hand-in-hand with labor to blanket key congressional districts with " issue ads " that were considered instrumental in the defeat of several conservative Republicans . <p> " We seized the opportunity by focusing unprecedented resources  --  those of labor . . . environmentalists and the pro-choice movement  --  in absolute opposition to the economic and environmental assaults of the Gingrich agenda , " wrote Citizen 's Action President Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now , Citizen Action 's leaders acknowledge , the group 's successful alliance with organized labor may have done more long-term harm than good . The group is entangled in a scandal involving illegal contributions to Teamsters President Ron Carey that could have dire implications for the organization 's future , some believe . <p> As the Teamsters scandal has mushroomed , it has drawn in top officials of the AFL-CIO , Democratic National Committee and a variety of unions and liberal activist groups . Many in organized labor worry that the allegations of an elaborate money-laundering scheme to help Carey win reelection will spell the end of the union reform movement . It also could damage a fragile alliance that has developed in recent years between labor and left-leaning outside political groups . <p> Federal prosecutors in New York are examining whether Citizen Action served as a money conduit for illegal contributions to the 1996 reelection campaign of Carey in return for increased union contributions . A spokesman for Citizen Action said no one in the organization knowingly participated in any illegal activities . Director Arlook and Rochelle Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York , according to the spokesman . <p> The connection to Citizen Action has been detailed by three former Carey campaign advisers who have pleaded guilty to fraud . Under an alleged scheme detailed in a federal election officer 's report , a Carey campaign adviser sought help in the fall of 1996 from a Citizen Action West Coast volunteer , Charles Blitz , who allegedly was asked to use his contacts in the liberal community to raise money for Carey . In return , the documents suggest , the Teamsters would find ways to increase their financial support for Citizen Action . Stephen Ryan , Blitz 's attorney , declined to comment . <p> In Carey 's first term as president , the Teamsters contributions to Citizen Action averaged little more than $ 11,000 a year . But late in 1996 , just two weeks before the Nov. 5 federal elections , the Teamsters donated $ 475,000 to the group . Prosecutors claim the Teamsters gave another $ 150,000 last year to the AFL-CIO  --  funds earmarked for Citizen Action as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action $ 45,000 in 1995 ; a year later , it gave $ 1.5 million . <p> Carey and officials of the AFL-CIO have said they have no knowledge of any illegal financing scheme . <p> " Citizen Action was our natural constituency . Where else could we find a like-minded grass-roots operation ? " one AFL-CIO official asked . <p> What rankles many in labor is that the Teamster election scandal grows out of good intentions  --  a drive to assure the 1996 reelection of Carey , a leading labor reformer , as president of the 1.4 million-member union . Carey was running neck-and-neck in a race with James P. Hoffa when campaign aides began looking for ways to pump more money into the Carey effort . Many in the Carey camp feared that Hoffa 's election would spell the death of the broad-based union reform movement and return the Teamsters to mob control . <p> Elaine Bernard , director of the Trade Union Program at Harvard , said the Teamsters case has left organized labor 's reform wing in a harsh bind . " My outrage is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The fact that they cut some corners and thought that was acceptable really undermines the whole reform movement , which was about throwing the mob out and bringing the unions back to control by the members . " <p> The scandal comes when labor 's leadership , which has dramatically increased support for organizing campaigns , has been under steady assault by political conservatives , who argue unions have fallen prey to a radical New Left leadership and are rapidly losing touch with working people . <p> The alliance with groups like Citizen Action , representing the social and cultural left of national politics , was part of an extraordinary realignment within organized labor over the past several years . Groups that were anathema to the leadership of the AFL-CIO under its previous leaders George Meany and Lane Kirkland were embraced under the leadership of reformers like Carey and John Sweeney , current head of the AFL-CIO . <p> Sweeney , himself an insurgent , joined the Democratic Socialists of America during his unprecedented 1995 election challenge for the AFL-CIO presidency . Just last month , Sweeney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesbian Task Force . <p> As part of the shift , a new generation of " 40-somethings " moved into key federation jobs and to power positions in major AFL-CIO unions . Sweeney , for example , immediately began replacing AFL-CIO department heads with his people , most from this generation of former grass-roots activists . Citizen Action was a link for many of them . <p> Karen Nussbaum , head of the new Women 's Department of the AFL-CIO and a founder of the union 9-to-5 group , is married to Arlook . Mike Podhorzer , a former national leader of Citizen Action and husband of EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner , recently joined the AFL-CIO 's political affairs department . Steven Rosenfeld began his career as a community organizer , then went to work for the Communications Workers of America . He was labor liaison at the Democratic National Committee and then at the Labor Department before Sweeney chose him to be political affairs director . Rosenthal 's wife helped found Citizen Action of New Jersey . <p> Heather Booth was a founder of Citizen Action and the Midwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbies . Last year , she worked for the Democratic National Committee , under the co-chairmanship of Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D-Conn . ) . <p> In 1965 , her future husband , Paul Booth , then 22 , was national secretary of Students for a Democratic Society and organized campus protests of the Vietnam War that were denounced by Dodd 's father , Sen. Thomas J. Dodd ( D-Conn. ) , as " tantamount to open insurrection . " Paul Booth met Heather at a 1966 Selective Service sit-in . <p> Today , Paul Booth is director of organizing for the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , the nation 's largest public-sector union , and a top adviser to its president , Gerald McEntee , who chairs the AFL-CIO committee that sets labor 's political agenda . Neither of the Booths have been implicated in the current scandal . <p> After years of operating at the fringes , Citizen Action gained political potency when Republicans took control of the House and Senate in the 1994 elections . From 1995 to 1996 , the budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 4.7 million to $ 11.7 million . <p> Much of the additional money went into a special new political advocacy fund created by Citizen Action , the Campaign for a Responsible Congress , that ran issue ads in 35 Republican-held districts . <p> After the 1994 GOP victories , " We felt like the world had been turned upside down , " said Jeff Blum , a transportation specialist for Citizen Action . " Led by Ira Arlook , we began to figure out a way to use the resources that we had built up over 20 years to defend in a way that allowed us to articulate a positive vision , to remind people that there was an alternative to the Gingrich-Armey-DeLay vision of America . " <p> Labor had the same reaction to the Republican takeover . Faced with the first Republican-controlled Congress in most of their working lives , key union presidents engineered the ouster of Kirkland and his replacement by Sweeney . <p> Sweeney called a one-day convention to launch a $ 35 million fund-raising drive for an unprecedented political campaign , similar to that pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican incumbents , using television and radio ads stressing Medicare and Social Security . The labor campaign coincided with efforts by the Clinton-Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee to raise massive amounts of " soft money " to finance waves of television ads . <p> The Teamsters scandal , however , has cast a pall over Citizen Action 's future . " This is a very painful situation for us , " said a Citizen Action spokesman who said he could not say more under orders from the group 's attorneys.
