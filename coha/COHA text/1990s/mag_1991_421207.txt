Section : HEART BEAT : The Healthy Heart Report How much do you know about this crucial dietary element that protects against cancer , diabetes , and other ailments ? <p> Fiber is generally defined as the portion of the diet that can not be broken down by digestive juices . It includes the tough structural portion of vegetable foods our grandmothers called " roughage . " Four-stomached animals , like cows and sheep , have a multitude of microbes in their rumen which can break down fiber . <p> We have no such obliging bacteria or protozoa . Once separated from the digestible components of our food , fiber passes , more or less unchanged , through our intestines . <p> Although we usually speak of fiber as if it were one compound , we now know that there are two different types , each with unique properties . One type includes cellulose , hemicellulose , and lignin , the insoluble components of plant walls . The second type includes the pectins and gums , water-soluble nonstructural components of plants . <p> An important characteristic of insoluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the intestine , insoluble fiber fractions tend to increase the size of the stool , making it softer and allowing it to pass more easily and quickly through the gastrointestinal tract . Insoluble fibers are found in greatest amounts in cereal , brans , and vegetables . Wheat bran is an excellent source of insoluble fibers . <p> Pectins and gums absorb water and characteristically form a bulky gel which slows the rate at which food empties from the stomach . The fleshy parts of an apple and the white portion of citrus fruits are common dietary sources of pectins and gums . Oat bran , which has become so popular recently , provides us with soluble fibers . <p> When compared to less industrialized countries , the fiber content of the American diet is quite small . Since the turn of the century , our fiber in take from whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables has steadily declined . Although estimates vary , it is thought that we consume only one-third to one-half as much fiber as people in less industrialized countries . Decreased fiber intake has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spotlight is focused on the links between fiber and atherosclerosis , diabetes , colon cancer , diverticular disease , and constipation . <p> Fiber has long been recognized as an effective antidote to constipation . But gastrointestinal benefits may extend well beyond preventing this common affliction . For one thing , studies suggest a relationship between a low fiber intake and the development of diverticulosis . In this disease , small , hard stools containing little water pass through the gastrointestinal tract with difficulty . This can strain muscles and increase the pressure . Over time , weak areas herniate into pouches called diverticula . A high-fiber diet is thought to play a role in preventing the disease from developing in the first place , and nowadays is commonly used to treat the condition . <p> Population studies also indicate an inverse relationship between fiber intake and colon cancer . The results of these studies are difficult to interpret . Many factors other than fiber content of the diet vary from one population to another . Other lifestyle differences may also influence the incidence of colon cancer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of colon cancer by decreasing the production of carcinogens ( cancer-causing agents ) in the feces , and by lowering the concentration of bile salts which seem to play a role in tumor development . Animal studies suggest that the type of fiber may be an important factor . Wheat bran seems to have more of an effect than other fiber sources . <p> High-fiber diets also appear to be of benefit to diabetics . Large amounts of soluble fibers seem to help control the rise in blood sugar after a meal . And the soluble fibers , including pectins and gums , can lower the amount of insulin needed to control the disease . <p> Finally , oat bran , which contains soluble fiber , has recently been the focus of enormous attention . Studies have shown that the soluble fibers it contains lower LDL cholesterol levels , the type associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease , without affecting HDL cholesterol , the type associated with decreased risk . The reason for the effect is unclear . Bile acids are the major raw materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber , binds to bile acids , and prevents them from being absorbed into the bloodstream . This may be one way in which fiber acts to lower blood cholesterol levels , but that is not the whole story . Other possible mechanisms under current study include the effects of fiber on enzymes which regulate cholesterol and bile acid production . <p> Oat bran is not the only source of soluble fiber in our diet . Legumes and vegetables also have large amounts and are also effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels . <p> In short , fiber is beneficial , with different types of fibers having different effects . Processing and refining generally remove fiber . <p> The best way to reap all the potential benefits of the several components of fiber is to include more whole grains , dried beans , fruits , and vegetables in the diet . QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS <p> Q. In checking the ingredients in a loaf of pumpernickel , I was surprised to learn it contained only white flour , and that the deep color came from caramel coloring . Are some pumpernickel breads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . In most supermarket brands the first ingredient is refined flour . However , the types and amounts of other flours , some of which are whole grains and others not , vary from one bread to another . Lacking fiber information , you can check the ingredients list on the package ; or , if you are buying bread at a local bakery , ask the baker . The higher up on the list the whole grains are listed , the more fiber the bread is likely to contain . <p> Perhaps the rather loose definition of pumpernickel , " a sour bread made of ' dark rye , ' " explains why darkness is about the only thing that one can expect . We checked recipes : in several cookbooks , and found no less variety there . One loaf , relatively high in fiber , was to be baked from 100% whole wheat , dark rye , and unbolted cornmeal . At the other extreme , there was a recipe for pumpernickel baked from light rye and degermed cornmeal . While it may come as a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocoa were used in several recipes . <p> Q. In checking bread labels , I was puzzled by one for a dark diet bread which weighed .66 ounce per slice . The label said that : it contained 1,350 milligrams of fiber per slice . The label on a second , where the slice weighed .75 ounce , said that : the bread contained 10% total dietary fiber . <p> The fiber in the second bread appeared to be mainly cellulose , with some bran flakes . Can you interpret this information for me ? <p> A. Yes . The lack of a standard labeling format for fiber allows for a variety of approaches , which , understandably , can confuse consumers . In both cases , deciphering the information requires the use of the metric system . In the first case , it appears that the manufacturers believes that larger numbers are more impressive . Moving the decimal point three places to the left provides you with more intelligible information . The bread contains 1.3 grams of fiber per slice . This is smaller than a typical slice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this slice contains as much fiber as a slice of 100% whole wheat bread . <p> As for the second , simply multiply the metric weight of the slice by 10% to determine the amount of fiber in the bread . In metric weight , an ounce is 28.35 grams . Since this slice is .75 ounce , it weighs about 21 grams and contains 2 grams of fiber . Finely ground cellulose does make it possible to provide white bread with a high fiber content , but the fiber is not of the same composition as that in whole wheat bread . <p> Q. Often included in lists of fiber fractions is a substance called lignin . What is it ? <p> A. Fiber is made up mostly of a group of substances sometimes classified as non-starch polysaccharides . These include such things as cellulose , hemicellulose , insulin , guar , plant gums , and mucilage . Lignin , however , is not a carbohydrate-like substance . It belongs to a group of compounds called polyphenols . <p> Lignin is one of the substances which contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not digested in humans and is known to inhibit the digestion of cell-wall carbohydrate by intestinal bacteria . The exact way this works has not yet been identified , however . <p> A basic problem which limits our understanding of the role of lignin in human nutrition is the fact that it is extremely difficult to develop laboratory methods which accurately analyze the lignin content of the diet or the feces . <p> Q. How much fiber should one get on a daily basis ? <p> A. It has been suggested that healthy adults should consume about 10 to 13 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories : this means about 27 to 35 grams per day for men ( with an average intake of 2,700 calories/day ) and 21 to 27 grams per day for women eating 2,100 calories/day . To put this into perspective , a slice of whole-wheat bread contains 2.4 grams of fiber , an apple provides 2 to 3 grams ( depending on the size ) , and a cup of cooked broccoli provides 6.3 grams . <p> The important thing to remember is to get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole grains , legumes , fruits , and vegetables is best . <p> Q. The current nutrition " message " includes the advice to consume more " complex carbohydrates , " but I do n't understand exactly what the term means . Please explain . <p> A. Complex carbohydrate is really a synonym for polysaccharide , a term which means " many sugars . " Occasionally an acid may be included in the structure . For example , inulin , the polysaccharide in Jerusalem artichokes , is made up of units of the simple sugar , fructose . And pectins are polysaccharides made up of galacturonic acid , as well as two simple sugars , glucose and arabinose . <p> The way the sugars are linked together determines the character of the carbohydrate formed , and consequently its chemical and physical properties . For example , amylase , a starch contained in common foods , including wheat and corn , is made up of the same glucose units as cellulose . But a difference in the way the glucose units are attached to each other means that while humans can digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the latter . <p> Whole grains and lightly milled cereals , rich in complex carbohydrates , also provides generous amounts of vitamins and minerals , especially trace minerals and fiber . <p> Q. I thought cooking reduced fiber content , but recently I read that cooking can actually increase the fiber in some foods . Is that true ? <p> A. It is possible that cooking can increase the fiber content of foods . The browning process , or so-called Maillard reaction , is a chemical reaction between a carbohydrate and an amino acid that results in changes in both color and texture , creating molecules which closely resemble lignin , as insoluble component of fiber naturally found in food . Thus , toast and bread crusts have more of this fiber fraction than either untoasted bread or the center of the loaf . However , while cooking can increase the amount of lignin in food , it can also result in the loss of some of the other fractions of fiber , both gums and pectins . While all this is interesting , from a practical point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dietary sources of fiber .
