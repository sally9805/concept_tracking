The train left the station headed for nowhere , its destination also its point of embarkation , its purpose not to transport its passengers , but to feed them . By early March , western Washington neared the end of the rinse cycle , a nearly perpetual curtain of ocean rain that blanketed the region for the winter months , unleashing in its wake a promise of summer . Dark , saturated clouds hung low on the eastern horizon . Well to the west , where the sun retreated in a violent display , a glimpse of blue cracked the marbled gray , as welcome to the residents of Seattle as any sight alive . Arrival at the dinner train surprised Doris Shotz . She had thought her husband Paul was taking her to Ivar 's , one of Seattle 's more popular fish-house chains . A simple dinner date had presented her with a test of sorts , being that it was her first evening leaving her four-month-old baby girl , Rhonda , with a sitter . She 'd finally decided she could handle an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire evening stuck on a train in the woods was unimaginable , unthinkable ! " Surprised ? " he asked , displaying the tickets proudly . On the verge of total panic , Doris reminded herself that Julie was an experienced sitter , having taken care of Henry for the last year , as responsible a fifteen-year-old as one could ask for . Better to give Paul his moment than to start a fight . They 'd been talking about the dinner train for years . And Doris had to concede that over the last nine months , Paul had been a saint . She owed him . " I ca n't believe it ! " she said truthfully . " I know . You did n't guess , did you ? " " Not for an instant . I promise : It 's a complete surprise . " " Good . " He reached down and took her hand and squeezed . She felt flushed . She wanted to be home with the kids . " All aboard , " he said . The train lurched . Doris Shotz shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although she did n't want to drink while nursing , she knew Paul would consider it an act of defiance to say no to any part of the celebration , and given that she had already gone this far to please her husband , she was n't going to let one glass of champagne ruin the evening . When the train turned east , the frosted mountains flooded crimson with the sunset , Paul said with obvious satisfaction , " This is a long way from the backside of a computer . " Paul repaired PCs for Micro System Workshop , a name his employer had invented because it could be reduced to MS Workshop , and in an area dominated by Microsoft those two initials meant dollars . Paul drove a blue MS Workshop van around the city , crisis to crisis , fire to fire : hard drives , networks , IRQ ports  --  Doris had heard all the buzzwords enough times to think she might be capable of a repair or two herself . Paul provided for them adequately . He loved her in his own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once had . Now the children absorbed most of her time and much of her love , too . She was n't sure exactly how to categorize her love for Paul ; she simply knew that she would always be at his side , would attempt to put up with his moods . But the truth was that she lived for her children , Rhonda and Henry . She had never before known such a complete feeling . It warmed her just thinking about it . She politely refused a refill of champagne as she watched her husband 's cheeks redden behind the alcohol 's effects . Clearly carried away with happiness and the light buzz that came from the champagne , he talked at her , but she did n't hear . Boys and trains , she thought . " Do you think I should call home ? " she asked him . " Call ? " She motioned to the rear of the train car . " There 's a pay phone . Cellular . I could call them . " " You know how much those things cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking his Casio and saying sarcastically , " we 've been gone a whole fifteen minutes ! " He leaned closer and she could smell the sweet alcohol on his breath , a smell that reminded her of the occasional drunken violence that Paul had sometimes brought with him to their bed . " They 're fine . Julie 's perfectly capable . " " You 're right , " she said , offering him a fragile smile . He nodded and stared out the window . She felt sick with anxiety . It occurred to her that in a few minutes she could excuse herself to go to the bathroom and use the phone . Paul would probably never know . The champagne bottle 's white plastic cork rolled noisily at his feet . The train clattered past condominiums that reminded her of a Monopoly board . A few of the couples had dressed for the occasion , though most wore jeans and sweatshirts . It was n't exactly the Orient Express . It soon became clear that Paul 's romance was with the train rather than her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping quickly as it always did when he drank in excess , her husband disappeared into the alcohol and she retreated into thoughts about her children . Ten minutes passed with minimal conversation . Doris excused herself and made the call home . It rang and rang , but there was no answer . Wrong number , she decided . At those prices  --  $3.95 for the first minute , $.99 each portion of a minute thereafter  --  Paul was certain to catch the charge on the credit card bill . But so what ? She pressed NEW CALL . She redialed , again suffering under the weight of its endless ringing . She could envision Julie busy with a diaper , or in the middle of feeding . It did n't necessarily mean trouble .... A fire , she thought . Paul 's home entertainment center  --  a sports center was more like it  --  crowded the outlets with far too many wires . What would Julie do in a fire ? The knot in her stomach twisted more tightly . Her fingers went cold and numb . Julie might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her imagination would n't let it go . Perhaps Julie had a boyfriend with her in the house . In that case , she would n't be paying attention to either the kids or the phone . Doris stole a look around the corner and down the shifting train car 's center aisle to the back of her husband 's head . She had already been gone a few minutes , and it would ruin everything if he caught her at the pay phone . She had promised him she would wait to call until after dinner . She hung up the receiver , deciding to slip into the washroom and then try again when she came out . But she emerged only to find someone else using the phone , ironically a mother happily talking to her children . When the woman hung up , Doris tried again . This time the phone 's endless ringing seemed a kind of punishment for trying at all . She glanced up the aisle at Paul , but now all she could think about was that there was something terrible going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered on the second ring . Doris concentrated on removing any panic from her voice . " Tina , it 's Doris . I have a really weird favor to ask of you .... " In her mother 's heart she knew : Something was dreadfully wrong . ? ?
