<p> Just when the noise level of complaints about lack of American vision in response to the new needs of Europe was reaching screech point , the Bush Administration came up with an impressive new plan . <p> Despite allied grumbles , it won warm support because it goes a long way toward meeting problems opened by German unification and collapse of the Warsaw Pact . Presumably , resentment at Washington will evaporate as governments get on with remodeling NATO . <p> Last year 's NATO summit meeting produced the same sense of Administration drift , mounting tension and - at the last minute - Bush proposals that brought accord . This time there was n't even a quick tour by special envoys to brief allied leaders on what was coming in London . There were just letters and phone calls from the President , which made Europeans feel shut out of the preparations . <p> Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker like this kind of personal diplomacy , but it has a price . It contributes to fears that the new " special relationship " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being left in the cold . The French sniff that the U.S. is foolishly backing any whim of Chancellor Kohl of West Germany , although it is Paris that has been pushing hardest for Mr. Kohl 's scheme to buy Moscow 's blessing . <p> President Mitterrand of France did n't want a NATO meeting until late in the year ( and there may be another in December ) so as to work out what he calls " the European identity in security affairs . " It 's not clear what he means , but Paris has reversed gears for the time being . <p> For at least six months , France was edging toward formal involvement with NATO 's military structure , which would make it much easier to solve problems of reform . Now , miffed , Mr. Mitterrand is saying France 's defense is entirely independent . Further , in tart asides , French officials suggest the U.S. is blocking useful change . " The Americans always get annoyed when Europe starts to emancipate herself , " Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said recently . <p> This kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably to be expected in a period of difficult diplomacy launching a new basis for allied relations . Too bad there was n't more finesse , but the underlying agreement is solid . <p> The Europeans want NATO to continue and they want Americans in Europe , even as they also want to offer Mikhail Gorbachev the assurances he says he needs to accept new German arrangements . <p> There is strong evidence supporting Britain 's Foreign Minister , Douglas Hurd , when he said in a newspaper interview , " I 've never known a time when there was less anti-Americanism in Europe , whether in Britain or on the Continent . " His judgment that " American engagement is absolutely fundamental to stability " is widely shared . <p> The Soviets are coming around to the same view , but it costs them , particularly in Mr. Gorbachev 's tense internal politics . There is evident difference between the Foreign Ministry and the military establishment , smarting at Eastern Europe 's " loss . " <p> Soviet diplomats are aware that they caused some of their own problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unacceptable . Now they need a way to back out , and Mr. Bush is providing that . He has wisely said or done nothing to humiliate them . <p> The grievance of most Soviet officers is not leaving Germany but having no housing , no jobs to go home to . The idea of staying on is not as attractive as the military planners claim . Already there have been attacks on their soldiers , and the East German Defense Minister said some had been disarmed to prevent retaliation , which could lead to grave incidents . <p> There is a good chance that the new NATO plan can be the keystone for a series of agreements with the East and adjustments in the West to construct the transition Europe needs after the cold war . The long term , the ideal of a workable all-European security pact , is n't the problem now . It is getting there . <p> After floundering , Washington has produced some sensible and sensitive ideas to carry out Mr. Bush 's pledge of going " beyond containment . " The proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the Soviets make their railroads , their grain storage system , their food distribution work is another example of identifying the critical needs and addressing them . This is the way to proceed , concretely . Leave the grand designs to historians ' hindsight . Even with rumpled edges , this is statesmanship.
