<p> YOU could fly to Paris and eat dinner and breakfast en route in the time it takes Antoine Bouterin to prepare his specialty , agneau a la cuilliere , or spoon lamb . Mr. Bouterin , the chef and owner of Bouterin restaurant on East 59th Street , puts a boned shoulder of lamb with vegetables , wine and stock in the oven , hangs a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the oven door and leaves the lamb alone for seven hours . <p> Seven hours ? <p> He 's not trying to be Con Edison 's poster child . The epic cooking time puts the lamb beyond fork tender to spoonable softness . <p> " I remember my grandmother making that dish in a terra-cotta pot when I was a boy , " he said . " It 's an old , traditional dish in Provence , and I was told it was served in the court of Louis XIV . Forks were not used much in those days , so they needed meat they could eat with a spoon . " <p> Larousse Gastronomique reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XIV lumbered to the throne , but that he actually preferred to eat with his fingers . What better dish to set before the king than meat cooked until it falls apart ? <p> These days , Americans are often so pressed for time that even an old-fashioned , two-hour pot roast is out of the question . Meat companies , with the encouragement of the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , a trade group , have even introduced fully cooked pot roasts that take only seven minutes  --  not seven hours  --  to reheat in a microwave oven . <p> But when the cooking time is stretched beyond two to three hours , at a reduced temperature of 200 to 300 degrees , not only does the meat become exquisitely tender , but the vegetables melt into the cooking liquid which , concentrated and enriched with the gelatin of the meat , turns intensely syrupy . <p> " When you cook something at 300 degrees or less , you have no disturbance , no movement in the cooking process , so it 's less shocking to the meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verbena on Irving Place , who has a winter menu of braised dishes , including ribs of beef she cooks at 200 degrees for six hours . " Higher temperature tends to tear the meat . It 's exactly like what you want when you make a custard : you do n't want the ingredients to separate . " <p> Ms. Forley said the flavors develop better , the way they do when you slowly cook a stock so the liquid barely shivers . <p> Whether it 's pork , lamb or beef , tougher cuts need gentle , moist heat to dissolve the rubbery collagen in the connective tissue and to melt it into a soft gelatin . For example , in red-cooked pork from Beijing , the meat is slow cooked in stock and soy sauce for four hours or more , until it can be pulled apart with chopsticks . The sauce , enriched with rock sugar , becomes a satiny glaze . <p> Of his lamb , Mr. Bouterin said , " The sauce almost becomes candied . " It happens only during the last hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a delicious payoff . <p> Mr. Bouterin said he did not know of many other chefs who bothered with this dish . Today , most American chefs are content to sear a slice of foie gras as quickly as possible and to splash it with a sauce . It 's the same with fish and steak , which come with crunchy vegetables alongside , followed by dessert blasted with a blow torch . <p> In Europe , the technology is going in the opposite direction . Daniel Boulud , the chef and co-owner of Restaurant Daniel , said that chefs are exploring the potential of what they are calling cuisine a basse temperature , or low-temperature cooking , using new ovens that can maintain extremely low temperatures , from 165 to 200 degrees . <p> " You want the food at a temperature too high for bacteria to develop but low enough to keep in the juices , " he said . " When you cook like this , below the braising temperature , the meat does not have a chance to stiffen . " Mr. Boulud is installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-end at 65th Street and Park Avenue . <p> On the home front , there was always the electric slow cooker , like the Crock-Pot . But long-term oven cookery offers more flexibility . You 're not stuck with a one-size container for all cooking jobs , and because the lid of a Dutch oven or casserole fits less tightly , more liquid evaporates and sauces become more concentrated . And an electric slow cooker can not be used uncovered , which is necessary for some recipes that need a crusty topping , like cassoulet , the classic country bean and meat casserole from Southwest France . <p> Long , slow cooking is ideal for dried beans , which should never be served al dente and which offer another opportunity to push the envelope to delectable lengths on cooking time . Left undisturbed in a slow oven , a crock or casserole of beans becomes richly flavorful . <p> For centuries , such recipes have helped fulfill the demands of the Sabbath , a day of rest and worship in many religions . A crock of beans cooks without violating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Eastern European Jewish cholent , and the North African version , dfina , was ready for dinner at sundown on Saturday , just as Boston baked beans nourished New England congregants following Sunday church . <p> One theory has it that the name cholent comes from the French " chaud " and " lent " meaning hot and slow . Though beans rarely require more than an hour and a half to acquire the proper buttery tenderness , extended cooking infuses them with the flavors of hearty meats and robust seasonings . <p> Left to their own devices in a slow oven , peeled pears nestled snugly together in an uncovered casserole for four hours at 300 degrees soak up the honeyed flavor of a bottle of sweet wine as the wine cooks down . <p> Long before a dial could be spun to bank a flame and control the temperature , cooks learned to take advantage of the retained heat in the walls of a fireplace and the gradually dwindling warmth of a bake oven . <p> A tradition that dates back to the Middle Ages on Murano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook various dishes in the kilns on Christmas Eve , the only time the raging furnaces are shut down . Glass trumpets announce a gathering , and a special goblet is presented for the best dish . Luciano Vistosi , a glass sculptor who lives on Murano , said that eel dishes were often cooked this way but that chicken roasted in clay in the ashes , called glassblower 's chicken , was often the best dish . <p> As any barbecue pit master knows , tenderizing and infusing flavor are only two of the advantages in cooking long and slow . The difference between pit barbecue and Mr. Bouterin 's lamb is that meat by the former method is not cooked in liquid ; gentle cooking in dry heat works wonders , too . <p> All those roasted tomatoes that chefs are using these days are produced by baking cut tomatoes for three hours or more in a 200-degree oven to evaporate excess moisture and to concentrate the flavor without causing the tomatoes to disintegrate . <p> Although cooking a piece of salmon for 20 minutes at 225 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ten Speed Press , 1997 ) is nothing compared with a six-hour recipe , it 's more than twice as long as it takes to sear the fillet at high heat . Mr. Trotter 's technique produces a portion of fish that retains its salmon-pink color and has a silken , almost custardlike succulence . <p> When it comes to roasting a duck , there is no better method of rendering the fat than a long and lazy roast . As the fat warms and eventually liquefies , it oozes out through many openings pricked in the skin of the duck . A quick browning is all that is needed to crisp the mantle of skin that envelops what has become moist , velvety , practically spoon-tender meat . <p> Louis XIV would undoubtedly have enjoyed that , too .
