<p> 0 GOVERNORS AND PRESIDENT BUSH HAVE SET SIX NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS FOR 2000 . CRITICS CALL THEM TOO AMBITIOUS ; FEW AMERICANS KNOW OF THEM . BUT SOME GEORGIANS ARE ALREADY TRYING TO MEET THEM . DURING AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK , WE PROFILE SUCH INNOVATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. ; TODAY : GOAL 6 : SAFE , DISCIPLINED , DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS. ; Talking it out - not slugging it out ; Mediation helps pupils settle fights <p> Jefferson , Ga . - Fourteen-year-old Jermaine Strickland was about to take a shot on the basketball court at Jefferson High School when he felt bodies crashing down on his back . When he turned around , the first person he saw was Chris Denton . <p> The two squared off , threw a few licks and argued for a few minutes more . <p> " Then , " said 13-year-old Chris , " we went to the office to cool down , and the next day we went to mediation . " <p> After 30 minutes behind closed doors with a trained student mediator , the two youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted he was never sure it was Chris who hit him , agreed to apologize or walk away if a similar situation occurred ; Chris agreed to cut down on the roughhousing and wisecracks . <p> Teaching children the skills to resolve their disputes peacefully is a trend in the nation 's schools as an alternative to traditional forms of of punishment . <p> Advocates say it 's a good way to curb violence . <p> In fact , some say student-run conflict-resolution programs such as the one at Jefferson High may be better than metal detectors and drug- sniffing dogs at achieving the national education goal of " safe , disciplined and drug-free schools . " <p> Goal 6 evokes images of schools run amok , with cocaine for sale and weapons in lockers . For the most part , this is n't the problem . Drug and alcohol use has fallen sharply in the last 10 years among teenagers ; according to the latest University of Michigan study , about 1 percent of 12th-graders reported using cocaine at school during the previous year . Six percent reported being injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , tension is a growing problem . Nationally , threats and injuries to students and theft and vandalism of student property have been steadily rising for the last 10 years , studies show . <p> Student mediation only works when students involved agree to it , but it also creates an atmosphere of cooperation that reaches beyond the isolated incidents being mediated , supporters say . <p> While most school systems have drug-awareness or drug-prevention programs and curricula , the teaching of conflict resolution is relatively new . It has its roots in the peace movement of the 1960s . Experts say the concept has taken off in the last decade and thousands of schools nationwide are now teaching conflict resolution . <p> Often , it is infused into the curriculum , taught in special classes or through peer mediation programs . <p> Jefferson School Superintendent Don Rooks got the idea from education journal articles on similar programs in New York and San Francisco schools . <p> He was so enthusiastic about the idea that he ran a 20-hour training class for the first student mediators to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has condensed the training to 1 1/2 days , and the number of trained student mediators now stands at 11 . <p> " When these kids go through mediation , " Dr. Rooks said , " I hope the next time conflict arises they will look at the fact that there is another way to resolve it . You do n't have to resort to fight or flight . " <p> Jefferson High 's student mediators handle a wide variety of conflicts , including poor sportsmanship , name-calling , jealousy , broken promises , threats and " ganging up " on people by cliques . <p> Dr. Rooks has instructed mediators to refer students who discuss drugs , weapons , conflicts with teachers or adults , fights where someone is seriously injured or life-threatening situations to school officials , because of their serious and possibly far-reaching implications. ; Closed-door sessions <p> Warring students who agree to attend mediation sessions are told that their discussions will be kept confidential . <p> During closed-door sessions , the mediators first ask both sides to explain the problem . Secondly , they identify and clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , the mediator meets separately with each student . Afterward , they regroup and discuss alternative solutions . If possible , the parties reach and sign a binding agreement . <p> When students fail to resolve their differences , their case is turned over to the principal or assistant principal , and they may face detention , suspension , expulsion or some other disciplinary action . <p> For conflict resolution to work , school officials must involve parents , students and the entire school community . It takes looking at conflict in a new way , said Annette Townley , executive director of the National Association for Mediation in Education ( NAME ) , a clearinghouse for information on conflict resolution housed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst . <p> " Most of us dread conflict because we do n't have the skills to handle it in constructive ways , " she said . <p> Student mediation programs have numerous benefits , but " are by no means a panacea , " cautioned Richard Cohen , director of School Mediation Associates in Maryland . <p> The most obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resolved effectively , said Mr. Cohen , whose organization trains students and teachers in conflict resolution . In addition , he said , there is often an increase in students ' self-esteem , a decrease in suspensions and detentions , and a school climate in which students feel safe . <p> " If anything , the world is going to get more conflict-ridden , " Mr. Cohen said . " We 're getting much more diverse and our resources are getting more limited . We 're going to have to try and talk things out . We need the skills and attitudes to do those things . " ; We 're hardheaded ' <p> Of the 45 disagreements settled through mediation since the Jefferson City Schools ' program began - the majority involving middle school students - most have ended in compromise and resolution , officials there say . <p> And several teachers and administrators say they are devoting less time to student discipline . <p> While the program has successful results , as with Jermaine and Chris , but it has n't worked for everyone . <p> Christopher York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches or fistfights . A trip to mediation did n't resolve their differences , and both landed in in-school suspension for several days . But they do n't blame the process for their failure to get along . <p> " It was n't the mediator 's fault . She did her job . We 're hardheaded , " 13-year-old Christopher said . <p> " You 're not supposed to only look at what the other person did , " added Anthony , 12 , " but what you did and how to do it without fighting . " <p> Their final agreement : to stay out of each other 's way .
