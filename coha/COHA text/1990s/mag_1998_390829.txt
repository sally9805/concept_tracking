Section : BUYERS ' GUIDE HARDWARE <p> We 've said it before : if you 're looking to purchase a PC this holiday season , the news has never been better . But listen up : the tail end of 1998 really is prime PC-buying time for just about every consumer . Whether you 're a first-time buyer or are on your way to a computer in every room , you can purchase a machine right now that will make Web surfing , writing , budgeting , creating and playing a pleasure  --  for a price that would have been unheard of a year ago . Today , even the cheapest , sub-$1,000 PC feels like yesterday 's dream machine . <p> This does n't mean shopping for a new PC is any easier , however . The most important question to ask yourself before you plunk down your annual bonus for a new box is : " What are we going to use the computer for ? " If you 're planning to run basic applications  --  a word processor , an accounting package , a spreadsheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't need a fancy machine with a DVD drive , monster surround-sound , digital-camera hookup and flat-panel display . On the other hand , if you want to play the newest version of Quake , you 'll need a machine that can handle 3-D graphics , snazzy sound effects and run video clips without a hiccup . <p> Next , think about what you want to spend . In years past , the conventional wisdom was to purchase the best machine you could possibly afford , even if it meant robbing the piggy bank . Today , first-time buyers and bargain hunters can get a good-performance machine from a name manufacturer ( without the monitor , which is usually sold separately ) for less than $1,000 . But many of us spend more : according to an October 1998 study of 2,000 households published by IDC Research of New York , most first-time buyers expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 for a new PC . <p> Finally , pay careful attention to the components when shopping . They change drastically from year to year . Most manufacturers let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rules of thumb for today 's component choices : <p> Which CPU for You ? The CPU , or main chip , is the computer 's brain . If you 're on a tight budget , look for a 233-MHz or higher Intel Pentium MMX , Celeron 300A or 333 , or Pentium II chip . Or consider the alternatives to Intel Inside : a 233-MHz or higher AMD-K6 chip , for example . Those who want to spend between $1,500 and $2,000 should go for a 300-MHz or higher Pentium II , a Cyrix MII 300 or an AMD-K6-2 . ( For Macs , the G3 chip is king . ) <p> If there 's any bad news this year , it 's for serious gamers . While there are plenty of CPU choices for most computer buyers , folks who want to play superfast multimedia games with lots of animation , video and sound may want to put off their purchase until next year . That 's when Intel introduces its so-called Katmai chip . Current 350-MHz or 400-MHz Intel Pentium II systems are fine for playing graphics-heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II because it 's the second generation of Intel 's special multimedia chip  --  is touted to handle complex multimedia far better than the current MMX chip , and reportedly runs at a sizzling speed of 500 MHz . <p> Thanks for the Memory . Generally speaking , the more random-access memory , or RAM , the better . The current practical minimum is 32 megabytes of RAM , but if you 're planning to run Windows 98 , aim for 64 MB . If you 're doing a lot of photo editing or other graphics work that requires large files , 128 MB is ideal .. <p> DVD and Conquer ? DVD ( digital video disc ) drives have become common enhancements in this year 's crop of new computers . These drives let you watch DVD movies on your computer . But Kevin Krause , an analyst with IDC Research , warns that DVD works well only in the most expensive systems . " Midrange systems do n't do a great job of decoding the video information , so movies will occasionally skip frames , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your computer screen , you 'll still be fine with a 16X or higher CD-ROM drive . <p> Monitor Musings . Computing is murder on the eyes . If your budget allows , spend a little more for a good monitor . Aim for at least a 15-inch monitor ; go for a 17-inch , such as the Sony Trinitron model , if you can afford it . Desktop publishers should plan on purchasing a 19-inch monitor , and people with deep pockets may want to look into a flat-screen display . <p> Once you 've decided on the kind of computer you 're after , and what you 're willing to spend , you 'll want to do a little window(s) shopping . Direct manufacturers such as Gateway , Dell and Micron offer fine machines at low prices ; the downside is that you do n't get to kick the tires first . <p> Other manufacturers , such as Compaq , Acer and Apple , sell through retail stores ; these will let you play with floor models , but salespeople may try to sell you something you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wal-Mart and CompUSA , are beginning to sell their own store-brand computers ; and local shops will happily build you a custom no-name clone . But these may not provide the level of reliability , service and support you want . <p> To find the best price on systems , go to the Web pages of manufacturers like Dell and Gateway to play with their " configurators "  --  groups of pull-down menus that let you choose the components ; the configurator then tells you the price you would pay for that machine . Many manufacturers will be willing to deal , so do n't be afraid to haggle . Whatever you do , take your time . Do n't plunk down your plastic until you are sure that you 're getting the computer that you really want . And when you find it  --  enjoy . DESKTOPS TABLE <p> Compaq stuffs the latest bells and whistles into its consumer machines . This one comes loaded with a fast 350-MHz AMD-K6-2 processor , 128 MB of RAM , an 8-GB hard drive , a cable-modem port and a video-phone hookup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accessory straight out of " The Jetsons . " Its slick design lets you hang two powerful JBL speakers from each side of the monitor . One of the more unusual features is what Compaq calls its Creativity Action Center . Sounds like a video arcade , but it 's actually a small design triumph : the " center " consists of one MIDI/game port and two universal serial bus ports on the front of the mini-tower that let you plug in joysticks , digital-camera cables and scanners without having to wrestle with cords at the back . A few years back , Compaq took some hits for reliability and support with its 4000 line of Presarios , but lately has been working hard to set things right . Send in the rebate for the Compaq Internet Access service , and you get $100 off . TABLE <p> This is the machine for the secret Martin Scorsese  --  or at least , music-video-maker  --  that lives in us all . This computer is actually designed to handle digital audio and video , so you can create and edit your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool for serious hobbyists . It comes with a 450-MHz Pentium II , a fat 13.6-GB hard drive ( one of the largest around ) , 128 MB of RAM and a zippy , 5X DVD drive . Plug in a digital video camera like the new Sony DCR-TRV900 Handycam , and you can use the bundled Dvgate software , which is specially developed by Sony for easy editing and adding special effects . You can add titles , transitions and even soundtracks , provided you have a compatible Sony MiniDisc deck or CD-changer . But if you go for this model , you 'll want the 17-inch monitor , which will run you an additional $499 . You 'll probably want an extension for the skimpy one-year warranty , too . TABLE <p> Never heard of Quantex ? Even though the Somerset , N.J. , company has been selling PC systems to small businesses and corporations since 1984 , its direct-sales program has yet to pierce consumer consciousness . Like its main competitor , Dell , Quantex targets people who want a good , solid computer for a decent price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or truckloads of software . This particular machine is hefty hardware for a puny price . It 's notable for its speedy 300-MHz Pentium II processor , and comes with 64 MB of RAM ( you can buy 32 more for $96 ) . It also comes with a 4.3-GB hard disk , a 32X CD-ROM drive and a pair of Altec Lansing speakers . The computer can grow with you , too , thanks to lots of additional slots and bays . This model is bundled with Corel Office Suite 8 , and it also comes with several general-reference and children 's titles such as Amazon Trail and Creative Workshop for Kids . Quantex is n't famous for its technical support , but it 's a good choice for computer-savvy consumers . TABLE <p> We like to think of Hewlett-Packard desktop systems as the PC equivalent of Volvos . They 're boxy and a bit creaky around the curves . But they are reliable and solid , perfect for kids who might not treat the family PC with as much care as you 'd like . And Hewlett-Packard gets consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 350-MHz Pentium II , 64 MB of RAM , a generous 8-GB hard drive and a DVD drive . It 's also packed with lots of software for adults and children . The tutorial software , in particular , is exceptional : newbies learn about everything it takes to become a smart PC user , from managing files to logging onto the Internet ( you get 50 free hours of Net access from GTE , too ) . Technical support is also superb : after they help you solve a problem , Hewlett-Packard support technicians will even give you a follow-up call to check on how you 're doing , like caring doctors . Budget-seekers should take a look at the 6330 model , which comes with an AMD-K6-2 processor and costs $1,098 with a 15-inch monitor . TABLE <p> It 's easy to see why North Sioux City , S.D.-based Gateway consistently wins awards for pleasing consumers : year after year its machines deliver tremendous bang for the buck . The G6-350 is n't much to look at  --  one of the drabbest boxes of the bunch  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with a speedy 350-MHz Pentium II CPU , an enormous 14.4-GB hard drive , 64 MB of RAM , a DVD drive , solid Boston Acoustic speakers and a generous three-year warranty . ( If you decide to buy the 450-MHz processor version with a 19-inch monitor , you 'll pay $2,659 . ) You can even control the music discs playing in your CD-ROM drive using one-touch buttons built into the keyboard . A software package called HelpSpot teaches you about your PC and trouble-shoots common problems like Windows error messages and system crashes . You can even get online training for applications like Microsoft Office . Gateway also makes it convenient ( though more expensive in the long run ) for consumers with cash-flow concerns to finance this system . Through its new YourWare program , you can purchase this system for $48 a month over four years , a payment option similar to what computer makers offered only to businesses in the past . After two years , trade it in for a new , state-of-the-art model . TABLE <p> For families who are dipping their toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good place to start . Acer has always made a point of building competitively priced , consumer-friendly machines , and this season the company is pushing this new system aggressively in retail stores such as Wal-Mart , Sears and Best Buy . This particular machine comes with a fast AMD-K6-2 333-MHz processor , 64 MB of RAM , a 4.3-GB hard drive and a 32X CD-ROM drive . Acer preloads two especially useful programs on its machines : the My Aspire Guide , an ultrafriendly software that will hold your hand should you run into problems , and a " just for kids " browser for tapping into kid-safe Web sites . On the downside , Acer 's warranty is on the skinny side ( one year ) ; though analysts say the company 's reliability record is " improving , " consider an extended warranty . TABLE <p> It 's hard to believe that a little more than a year ago , Silicon Valley pundits were debating the future of Apple , following two years of terrible losses and layoffs . But Apple 's back and even enjoying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its popular new iMac ( " How It Thinks Differently , " page 90 ) . But iMac is n't the only hot new system from Apple . This elegant G3 tower , designed for Mac lovers with a need for speed , runs faster than just about anything else on the market . Aside from its 333-MHz PowerPC G3 processor , it comes with a generous 128 MB of RAM , a 9-GB hard drive and a 24X CD-ROM drive ( if you want to watch movies , consider paying $80 extra for DVD ) . Should you want to link this machine to your iMac through a local-area network , there 's an Ethernet card , too . The machine is n't perfect . Though it 's well equipped , there 's not a lot of room to grow , and it does n't come with a modem or any bundled software . Still , Mac lovers will find this a dream machine . TABLE <p> A solid starter system for families or students on a shoestring budget , this system features an AMD-K6 350-MHz CPU , 64 MB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially designed for surfing the Net , it also comes with a slot for an optional $80 Ethernet card . College dorm rooms are often wired with Ethernet local-area networks , which make the Aptiva ideal for students who may want to use the computer to register for classes or send e-mail to the folks . IBM sweetens the deal with a mail-in rebate  --  you get $20 off on an IBM scanner . On the downside , the system does n't have many of the extra slots and bays you might later want for adding memory or extra drives . Considering that IBM is promoting this model as its main multimedia machine for home users , the one-year parts-and-labor limited warranty is disappointing . As a rule , a year simply is n't long enough to put your PC through all its paces ; multimedia applications will push your hardware to the limit . So it may be a good idea to purchase an extended warranty from the retailer for this one . TABLE <p> When Intel first released its low-cost Celeron CPU last spring , the company got raked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked the additional cache  --  extra memory that makes a chip run faster  --  it needed to perform well . But a new , and improved , 333-MHz Celeron ( code-named Mendocino ) has found its way into the Millennia C333 , Micron 's well-honed system for the budget-minded . This system packs the better chip , 64 MB of RAM , a 6.4-GB hard drive and a 32X CD-ROM drive into a mini-tower case that fits neatly under your desk . For the top of your desk , there 's a big 17-inch monitor and a couple of nice Advent speakers . Unfortunately , the on-site service warranty 's only good for a year . And you may want to spring for a more powerful processor after all : pay $50 more , and you get the Pentium II version . MONITORS <p> Ultraslim LCD monitors are breaking the $1,000 barrier but remain far more costly than standard CRTs . Still , once you 've tried one , you 'll never go back . We liked these four : TABLE <p> Princeton 's 14-inch DPP 500 digital display is arguably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it comes with a good 3-D graphics adapter card that you can plug into your PC . The color on this monitor , the first in a new series of digital flat-panels from Princeton , is stunningly clear , and the uniformity of the image is excellent . It also comes with built-in stereo speakers and a microphone . TABLE <p> If you want to cause monitor envy , choose Apple 's Studio Display . It sports a slick blue-gray casing and terrific image quality . But the best thing about this 15-inch digital display is that it works with both Windows and Mac computers . You can choose between a picture-frame-style stand and a base that lets you easily adjust height and angle . Downside : the warranty 's up in a year . TABLE <p> Champion monitor manufacturer NEC offers a wide range of LCD monitors , including the MultiSync LCD1500M 15-inch analog model . In addition to brilliant screen color , it comes with stereo speakers , a headphone connector and a three-year limited warranty . If you really need to save money , check out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $799 . TABLE <p> IBM enters the flat-panel fray with the T55 . The viewing area of this 15-incher is bigger than that of most other monitors in its price range , and easier to read from oblique angles . The T55 comes in both analog and digital models . You can plug the analog directly into your PC ; you 'll need to buy the $150 graphics card for the digital version . Both come with a three-year limited warranty . LAPTOPS <p> This year 's crop of notebooks are a diverse bunch : from sleek , warp-speed demons to ones that wo n't break the bank . We picked eight of the best ; you only need one . TABLE <p> ThinkPads have always been targeted at corporate road warriors , too pricey for most consumers . But the i Series brings these popular notebooks within reach . The i Series 1450 comes with features you usually see in costlier systems : a 266-MHz Pentium with MMX processor , a gorgeous 18.1-inch display , 64 MB of RAM , a 4.8GB hard drive . If you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which start at 82,499 . TABLE <p> The Inspiron 3200 288ST is yet another topnotch entry from the manufacturer with the best record for notebook reliability and customer service . It comes with a 233-MHz Pentium II CPU , 82 MB of RAM , a DVD drive and a bright 12.1-inch screen . The hard drive is just average  --  it 's 3.2 GB  --  but the machine is light , 6.4 pounds . One modular bay lets you plug in a floppy drive , a 24X CD-ROM drive or an optional second battery . TABLE <p> Think of the Presario 1810 as a home theater in a notebook . Just pop a movie-on-DVD into its built-in drive and let the fast 300-MHz Pentium II CPU spin out hours of entertainment . The nice 13.3-inch screen and amazing sound system do n't hurt either ( not to mention its 64 MB of memory and fat 6.4-GB hard drive ) . This machine features special , undersize JBL Pro audio speakers that deliver better sound than most desktops . TABLE <p> The new PowerBooks are fast , and have curved edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a BMW . The model we tested featured a 233-MHz G3 processor , 32 MB of RAM , a crystal-clear display , a built-in 20X CD-ROM and an Ethernet card . Oddly , it lacks a modem and a floppy drive , and the hard drive holds only 2 GB . Graphics professionals should spring for the $2,799 model , with a bigger screen and a 56-Kbps modem . TABLE <p> Generally , the less you pay for a notebook , the more weight you 're expected to lug around . But Sony 's VAIO PCG-748 bucks the trend : this slim computer weighs only 5f pounds . The processor is a Pentium 266 with MMX ( sorry , no II here ) and the display is n't brilliant , but it 's a generous 13 inches . You get a 4-GB hard drive , 64 MB of RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive , too . If you want a brighter display , consider the $2,199 PCG-812 . TABLE <p> If you want an inexpensive notebook with good battery power , try the Solo 2500 SE . It comes equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAM and a 20X CD-ROM . The screen is bright and clear , and the whole thing weighs in at just below 7 pounds . The only problems : a smallish 2-GB hard drive and a fragile modem jack that pops out of the casing and seems easy to break . But all in all , a sleek number . TABLE <p> Weighing in at 6.4 pounds , the OmniBook 2100 is n't a shoulder-killer . The $2,399 model features a 233-MHz Pentium II processor , a 12.1-inch screen , a 4-GB hard drive and 32 MB of RAM . The bay can be home to a second battery , or a CD-ROM , floppy or Zip drive . For additional comfort , purchase the three-year warranty for $199 . If you 're on a really tight budget , consider the $1,499 model with a 200-MHz Pentium MMX . TABLE <p> This is the kind of notebook that really makes people turn their heads . But it 's not just pretty and slim ( just over 4 pounds ) . Based on a 266-MHz Pentium II , the Portege 7000CT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 4.1-GB hard drive . The stylish silver case hides a vivid 12.1-inch screen and a surprisingly large keyboard . The only downside is a battery that lacks staying power , but you can purchase a backup for $189 . PRINTERS TABLE <p> Want a cheap printer for the kids ? You ca n't beat the price on this slow but serviceable color inkjet : after the $30 rebate , you 'll spend just $89 . You get what you pay for : the quality of the printer is perfectly acceptable , so long as you are n't too hawkish on color fidelity . To make its greenish-looking black , the printer mixes cyan , magenta and yellow inks . Those who require better-looking prints and speedier operation will want a sturdier machine , like the $249 Lexmark 5700 , which delivers superb prints much faster . TABLE <p> Do your children have big printing projects  --  like birthday banners or school newspapers ? This printer can handle paper as large as 11 x 17 inches  --  a very unusual feature for low-cost inkjet printers . This one can produce impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-quality prints . Printing is fast , too : two cartridges work together to print half the page each , instead of one crossing the whole page width . SCANNERS TABLE <p> It 's hard not to fall in love with this cute , slick scanner . It 's mindlessly simple to set up ( just plug it in and load the software drivers ) and easier to use than a copy machine . Open the cop , put the item you want tos can face down on the galss and push a button . Within less than a minute you will see the image appear on your computer screen . The OneTouch does a good job of scanning typewritten pages , handwritten notes and business cards and then translating them into editable text . The scanner comes bundled with excellent OCR ( optical character recognition ) software that reproduces typed characters so that you can work with them in your favorite word-processing program . You can use the scanner to copy and fax , and you can make easy touch-ups and clean up images with the PhotoEnhancer software that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the end of the year , you 'll score a $30 rebate . TABLE <p> The coolest thing about scanners is that they produce clean and clear images at a price most people can afford . If you like the simplicity of point-and-shoot cameras , or do n't want to spend the money for a digital model , you 'll love Hewlett-Packard 's series of " smart " scanners . They feature the company 's Intelligent Scanning Technology , which can " see " the difference between images and manuscripts . This means when you put in a photo or a page , the scanner automatically adjusts the brightness and resolution , depending on which kind of image it 's looking at  --  a snapshot , a drawing , a typed page , a handwritten note . Beginners should try the ScanJet 4100C , an affordable entry-level workhorse that produces bright , sharp images . This model comes with Adobe PhotoDelux photo-editing software and the OCR works fine . Advaned home users and small-business owners should opt for the 6200C ( photo ) , which gives you nearly double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : COMPAQ PRESARIO 5150 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SONY VAIO PCV-E308DS <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : QUANTEX QP6/300 M-1X <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : HP PAVILION 8370 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : GATEWAY G6-350 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ACER ASPIRE 2191 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : APPLE POWER MACINTOSH G3 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : IBM APTIVA E3 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : MICRON MILLENNIA C333 <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : MONITORS : PRINCETON , APPLE , NEC , IBM <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : LAPTOPS : IBM , DELL , COMPQ , APPLE , SONY , GATEWAY , HEWLETT-PACKARD , TOSHIBA <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : PRINTERS : LEXMARK 1100 COLOR JETPRINTER , CANON BJC-5000 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SCANNERS : VISIONEER PAPERPORT ONETOUCH , HEWLETT-PACKARD SCANJET 4100C &; 6200C <p> By BRONWYN FRYER <p> <p> Fryer is the author of the upcoming " Unofficial Guide to Buying a Computer " ( Macmillan , 1999 ) . <p> IMAC HOW IT THINKS DIFFERENTLY <p> WHEN MY OFFICE MATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine Apple loaned me for a test drive , she gave a little scream : Oh , it 's so cooool ! ' We gushed unlikely ( for computers , anyway ) adjectives like gorgeous ' and beautiful ' as we carried the Swatch-like , teal-colored machine by its built-in carrying handle to a spare desk . Setting up the iMac took about five minutes : we connected the keyboard and mouse to the main unit , snapped a phone cord into the modem port and plugged the electrical cord into the wall . That was it . Amazing , ' I said . <p> Donna , a lifelong Mac user , was delighted with more than the iMac 's color . She liked the molded case and the fact that the all-in-one unit did n't take up her entire desktop . She was impressed with the speed of the CPU and with the sleek , albeit small , keyboard . She did struggle a bit , though , with the unfamiliar round mouse . <p> For complete computer novices who want to surf the Net and send e-mail , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mac , which , after all these years , still runs the most user-friendly operating system ever created . It comes with a speedy G3 processor , 32 MB of RAM , built-in stereo speakers , 4-GB hard drive , a 3-D graphics card and a 56.6-Kbps modem  --  all for $1,299 ( 800-538-9696 ; www.apple.com ) . The eye-catching design is worth something , too : in a world where computing devices play bigger roles in our daily lives , style becomes an important attribute . <p> Then Donna got the bright idea of transferring a file from her trusty old Mac Performa 631 to the newcomer . That 's when she cried out in dismay , There 's no floppy drive ! How am I supposed to transfer files ? ' Good question . The lack of a floppy turns out to be a puzzling aspect of the iMac , whose small i stands for Internet . <p> With any other Mac , you can transfer files on floppy disks or use a brilliant piece of built-in software called AppleTalk , which allows you to easily move files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not so with the iMac , which instead comes equipped with a built-in Ethernet card . Ethernet makes the iMac great for networking  --  but only if you 're linking it to another Mac that 's similarly configured and have been brave enough to set up a local-area network . ( PowerBook users can also transfer files through iMac 's infrared port . ) <p> The departure from standard compatibility conventions is strange , because Apple has always made a big deal of the fact that Mac users can easily swap files between old and new machines . But since Donna 's Performa does n't have an Ethernet card , the only way that we could find to transfer files is to e-mail them . Nor can she print , because there 's no parallel port to which to hook up her printer . Donna can print if she pur- chases a special cable such as the $99 HP Printer Cable Kit for iMac , which hooks up to HP DeskJet 670 or 690 inkjet printers . Or she can go out and buy a brand-new printer with a USB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a new technology for connecting peripherals to PCs and Macs ; it lets you plug in many different devices  --  like keyboards , modems , mice , scanners , printers and joysticks  --  through a simple USB socket . ) <p> All these gotchas have left Donna feeling frustrated and disappointed . She says , iMac is like meeting the perfect man and finding out that he 's married . ' The moral of the story : if you 're buying your first computer  --  and do n't need to print for the time being or transfer files regularly  --  by all means get an iMac . Otherwise , shop for a computer that does n't think , er , quite so differently . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : iMAC <p> By BRONWYN FRYER <p>
