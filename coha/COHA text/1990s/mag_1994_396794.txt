LOST AMID the splendor of Senegalese parrots , clotted cream , and male servants at the Manhattan mansion of Dreyfus Chairman Howard Stein is a dirty truth we 've all been dimly aware of for years  --  that Stein and his colleagues throughout the money management industry are among the most overpaid people in the country . Year after year Americans turn over their hard-earned dollars to professional investors whose results have been mediocre at best . But now , at last , the public has drawn a line in the sand . John Carroll , head of GTE 's $12 billion pension fund , speaks for individuals and institutions alike : " The fat days are over . " Why the sudden awakening ? Because money management fees are starting to pinch in a way they have n't in years . Over the past decade , when stocks and bonds were appreciating 15% to 20% a year , few folks quibbled about fees . But returns in this era of diminishing expectations are already diving into the single digits , and fees are likely to have twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bite that an increasing number of investors wo n't stand for . Money managers , both those with subpar results hiding out in their cushy quarters and those who can stand proudly behind their records , are worried that investors will get increasingly balky about paying top dollar for their services . Says Morgan Stanley 's head of asset management , Barton Biggs : " I wo n't help you with this story because I do n't want you to write it . " Here 's one good reason : Morgan Stanley 's earnings fell 46% last quarter , a slide the firm attributes to revenue declines in investment banking and trading . Biggs 's department , however , showed sturdy gains : Revenues from asset management climbed 39% , to $89 million . Pressure on money management fees will spoil what Vanguard 's chief , Jack Bogle , calls " the most awesome profit margins in U.S. industry . " Indeed , while Microsoft earned an enviable 25 cents after taxes on every dollar of revenue last year , Dreyfus pocketed 26 cents . Chicago 's John Nuveen &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay college tuition for the children of its employees as a routine benefit , earned 29 cents . Privately owned money management firms generally do even better than that : Institutional investors pay about $6 billion to outside professionals to manage some $3 trillion in pension money . Close to half that fee is pure profit . Says Charles Marsh , president of asset management consultants SEI Capital Resources in Wayne , Pennsylvania : " We know several firms that manage billion of dollars with five employees . Most do n't beat their benchmarks "  --  typically the market averages  --  " but 90% of them are getting rich . " Value-conscious investors have already found some chinks in the armor . With just a little prodding , for instance , brokerage firms will lop almost a full percentage point off the hair-raising 3% annual fee they routinely impose on wrap accounts . Investors have put between $60 billion and $100 billion into these accounts . Wrapping all advisory and transaction costs into a single , heavy fee , brokers merrily allocate , and reallocate , the assets among different investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are now over 6,000 funds to choose from , compared with 2,493 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange  --  has started to chip away at the share of assets that goes to expenses . Expense ratios on U.S. diversified stock funds , for example , rose 30% during the Eighties , to a high of 1.142% of assets in 1990 . By the end of last year , expenses averaged 1.24% . FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT for investors , both individuals and institutions , is that modern compensation techniques have finally begun to find their way into this sheltered industry . A third of pension funds either have negotiated or are contemplating a new payment system for their money managers that is based on the manager 's performance . In lieu of an automatic payment each year of up to 0.5% of assets under management , some investors have begun to pay according to how well their hired hands perform . Money managers who fail to deliver an agreed-upon return earn little more than their expenses . Individual investors are also demanding  --  and getting  --  more accountability : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Salomon Brothers ' Investors fund , now tie the fees they charge to the fund 's performance . One of the most militant proponents of performance-based fees is GTE 's Carroll , who farms out a big chunk of his company 's pension money to nearly 50 managers . Carroll gives them three years to beat their benchmark , be it the S &P; 500 or any other index , by two percentage points after fees . To ensure that this does not encourage inappropriate risk taking by the managers , Carroll insists that they invest his money no differently from their other accounts . Those managers who surpass the goal by five percentage points can double their take . Those who fall seriously short can get the boot and settle for as little as 15% of their usual fee . Over the past seven years , Carroll 's unforgiving system has saved GTE $10 million in fees . " Sometimes I feel like John the Baptist on this , crying in the desert , " says Carroll . " Managers who do n't do a good job for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees because the majority of them would suffer a serious blow . Performance Analytics , a pension consulting outfit in Chicago , looked at the record of over 2,700 equity managers . " Devastating " is how President Bob Moseson describes the results ( see chart ) . The S &P; 500 index lost 3.4% in the first half of this year , but that . performance was still better than the record achieved by 71% of money managers . The industry 's ten-year record is even worse : Over that period , the S &P;  --  which investors can easily shadow for next to nothing by buying a mutual fund that invests in the stocks that make up the index  --  beat 74% of the professionals . The performance story on variable annuities , vehicles for deferring taxes sold by insurance companies , is also a sorry one . All the rage , variable annuities have now cumulatively attracted close to $170 billion , nearly four times what people had poured into them by the end of 1992 . Yet these products , which allow people to invest in mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average insurance expense fee on top of an average expense ratio of 0.74% . No surprise , then , that it can take more than a decade before the cumulative tax benefits of a variable annuity begin to outweigh all the fees . Whereas bigger bucks can usually buy a tastier meal , finer clothes , and a better education , this privilege does not automatically extend to investors . Cost Effectiveness Measurement , a pension advisory and research firm in Toronto , looked at the fees paid by 200 pension funds in the $5 billion range and their returns in 1990 , 1991 , and 1992 . Says director Keith Ambachtsheer : " There was absolutely no correlation between what you paid and what you got . " The same anomaly holds true for mutual funds . Don Phillips , publisher of the newsletter Morningstar Mutual Funds , finds evidence suggesting that cheaper is better . Phillips looked at the A fees and performance of over 1,200 U.S. diversified stock funds ( see chart ) . chart omitted Those charging higher expenses consistently produced lower returns . " Clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better results . " Despite the stark tale in the numbers and the growing investor resentment of the institutions that deliver those results , the revolutionaries still have a lot of persuading to do . Legions of people fleeing low rates on bank CDs still flock to money managers with their wallets wide open . Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. researchers estimate that institutional and individual investors have entrusted nearly $9 trillion to professionals , a 12-fold increase since 1975 . Professionally managed mutual funds have swelled to over $2 trillion today , or two-thirds of the amount people store in banks and thrifts . Money has also been pouring in from 401(k) plans , the defined-contribution pension plans that account for a significant portion of people 's retirement nest eggs . Money in 401(k)s is growing at a clip of 15% a year and now exceeds $475 billion , nearly 30% of it in actively managed mutual funds . Managers have advanced little in terms of providing value , but they are ever more sophisticated when it comes to drawing in new accounts . Their latest target is the high-net-worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who struck it rich in the Eighties , or entrepreneurs who recently sold a business . PSI , a financial services consulting outfit in Tampa , estimates there are over 4.5 million households in the U.S. whose net worth , including the value of their homes , exceeds $1 million , up from 2.7 million households in 1989 . U.S. Trust , which aggressively courts old and new money with a sales force of more than 30 people , figures that only a third of the $4.5 trillion in the hands of wealthy individuals is professionally managed so far . Says President Jeffrey Maurer : " The rest is up for grabs . " And grab they do . As the amount of money available for management has grown prodigiously , so has the number of outstretched hands . First in line , of course , are the many thousands of money managers . Hovering right behind them are the so-called managers of managers  --  like Frank Russell Co. of Tacoma and SEI  --  that screen , recommend , and monitor pension fund managers . Some of these consultants also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allocate their assets . In sum , says Cost Effectiveness Measurement 's Ambachtsheer , " there are a lot of pigs at the trough . " Feeding all these people their fees explains in part why money managers produce such meager returns on average . " If the top person at Sara Lee takes home more money one year , it does n't affect the cheesecake , " says Martin Gruber , chairman of the finance department at New York University 's Stern School of Business . " But if a fund manager does that , investors can go home hungry . " AMONG THE OTHER forces tugging at money manager performance are the high cash positions that mutual funds must maintain in order to meet redemptions . But beyond this weight , managers worsen their chances even more with hyperactive trading , hoping to evade a correction or catch a sudden rally . Such market timing  --  what money managers like to call tactical asset allocation  --  contributes to the industry 's lackluster performance because it often results in managers being out of stocks just when they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unexpected bursts of buying , when bearish sentiment is still high . The rallies are powerful and brief , leaving market timers little chance to get back in . That delay can be devastating . Investors who missed the stock market 's 40 best days in the 1980s saw their portfolios appreciate a puny 3.9% a year , vs. a 17.5% annual average for investors who just stayed put . Chasing glamorous stocks can also have a brush-fire effect on returns . Though professional money managers enjoy lower commission rates than individuals , they typically trade so often that commissions make a bigger dent in their performance . Morningstar calculates that the average equity growth fund manager changes his or her portfolio by more than 80% every year . Many aggressive growth funds will show portfolio turnover of more than 130% a year . Such activity not only is expensive but also generates a tax liability for mutual fund investors , further paring returns they receive . For all the buying and selling they do , few managers are able to position themselves in the right stocks . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance professor Josef Lakonishok believes institutional money managers insist on pursuing everything that 's popular at the moment to placate pension plan directors . Says he : " If you buy Wal-Mart and it declines 40% , no one complains because every other pension fund owns it also . " Mutual fund managers are subject to peer pressure that often moves them to make the same mistake . Even given all this , it would be patently unfair to assume that most money managers are dunderheads just because they usually turn in mediocre results . As Morgan Stanley 's U.S. investment strategist Byron Wien persuasively argues , doing well " takes a lot more than bright people working hard . It takes a special combination of effort , intuition , flexibility , and discipline to succeed over time , and not many people have those qualities in agreeable proportions . " ( For a look at a few people who do combine these attributes , see box , " Why Some Succeed " ) . One big mystery is why it has taken consumers so long to question the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have long since beaten such undeservedly outsize profit margins into the ground . What 's keeping them aloft ? " If I said testosterone , I 'd be in big trouble , " says Alan Blanchard , who runs the $2.7 billion pension fund for the Episcopal Church . " But it 's heady stuff to have a bunch of well-educated guys descend on your office , laugh at your jokes , and show you a bunch of colorful charts . There 's nobody there to say the emperor has no clothes . " The naked truth about money managers is that their usefulness goes way beyond investment help to providing other sorts of comfort . " No honest person in this business would say you 're paying for performance . What you 're paying for is someone to take care of you , " says Louis Harvey , president of the Boston research outfit Dalbar Financial Services . That handholding comes at a steep price . NYU 's Gruber and Ned Elton and Fordham 's Chris Blake found that for every dollar that bond fund investors spend on fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That means the service you get had better be worth 80 cents to you , " says Gruber . In all fairness , money managers have taught American business a thing or two about coddling customers . Large fund families like Fidelity and Dreyfus , for instance , will supply insomniacs with account information at three in the morning if they so desire . By pooling funds , money managers provide diversification and access to exotic markets that are closed to small-timers . And while people could probably do a relatively decent job of investing on their own were they so disposed , many feel inadequate and ill-equipped to compete with the so-called professionals . " There 's a mystique surrounding these people , " says consultant Ambachtsheer . For what it 's worth , that mystique reassures people . Pension fund directors also find a most comforting scapegoat in their money managers . Columbia law professor Louis Lowenstein heads a research project that has explored , among other issues , why institutional investors fail to perform better . " Our research found a group of people who were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble than they were with maximizing returns , " he says . A big problem , he says , is that many investors overdiversify , spreading money over many managers , industries , and countries . " There is also a lot of me-too behavior , " says Lowenstein . " No one wants to look bad , so everyone follows the crowd . The idea is to look respectable . " But if respectability is truly prized , why do n't more investors go with safe and predictable index funds that would guarantee benchmark returns ? Says James Martin , who indexes about two-thirds of the CREF pension fund 's $57 billion equity portfolio : " Indexing sounds boring to people . There is the feeling that there 's some magic being performed in the money management business . People do n't want to pick the tortoise , but I keep reminding them that the tortoise wins . " Indeed , in the decade ended June 30 , CREF had returned 15.1% a year to investors after fees  --  which was exactly in line with the S &P.; Despite their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments . " There 's something un-American about them , " says Morningstar 's Phillips . " Index funds have no romance . " Vanguard 's Bogle , whose funds command 60% of the index market , believes that behind the desire to buck the odds is " the hope-springs-eternal impulse . " Bogle figures his cut-rate funds will save Vanguard investors $780 million in fees this year . He drives a 1987 Acura Legend coupe , and his entire house , he says , would fit in Donald Trump 's living room . While the lower investment returns of the Nineties are already focusing the spotlight on some fees , there is still plenty of darkness out there . Participants in 401(k) plans , for instance , pay money managers anywhere from $6 to $300 a year , depending on the size of the account and the services offered . Since the fees come right out of a plan 's total assets , few people are aware of them , including the corporate sponsors . Dalbar 's Harvey found that 78% of employers had no clue as to what investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey : " Fees are bundled in 80 different ways . " If the public is dulled to fees , it 's partly because of the arcane way they 're expressed . An expense ratio of 2% , for instance , may sound like mumbo jumbo to some or seem insignificant to others . It 's neither . Over a decade , a 14% return would inflate a $10,000 investment to $37,000 ; a 2% expense ratio would cut returns to $30,000 . Industry performance records tantalize  --  and mislead . While mutual funds trailed the S &P; during the Eighties , the industry has been quick to boast of its performance since then . The S &P; has returned 9.93% a year since 1990 ; the average diversified equity fund has returned 10.54% . But wait : Mutual fund statistics are a roster of survivors . They do not reflect the record of funds that go under or are merged into another fund . The most striking example of this was the Sector Analysis fund that Elaine Garzarelli ran . World famous for having called the 1987 crash , Garzarelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next year , the market rose 16% ; Garzarelli lost 13% . Subsequent returns were mediocre , and in July the fund was merged into the Smith Barney Strategic Investors Fund . Garzarelli 's poor performance record disappeared . If institutional investors are set to launch a full-fledged revolt against money managers , they 'll find lots of grassroots support around the U.S. For years , clusters of people , old and young , have looked askance at the fees and performance of the experts and insisted they could do the job just as well themselves . They have . The nation 's 13,000 or so investing clubs , with homespun names like Up Your Assets and Gold Diggers , have , on average , beaten the S &P; in 22 of the past 34 years , according to the National Association of Investors Corp. , whose 273,000 members have invested more than $50 billion on their own . FOR A GLIMPSE of Main Street moxie , stop in at Burnsville Senior High School , just south of Minneapolis . There business education teacher Jerry Cooper , 47 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if they can outsmart Wall Street and make a little money . Students come up with ideas , research the companies in the local library , and try them out on the rest of the group . With a portfolio that includes names like Abbott Labs and Rubbermaid , they 've beaten the S &P; by an average of 2.7% a year since 1990 . Before investors plunk any money on Cooper 's doorstep , however , remember that Nobel economics laureate Bill Sharpe believes it could take 20 years or more of statistics to prove anything conclusive about someone 's performance . Since few of us can wait that long , it 's safer to assume that statistics are virtually useless in predicting the future . But do keep your eye on one figure : the fee . <p>
