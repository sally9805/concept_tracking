<p> It 's math time at the Sherman Oaks Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School . But instead of pulling out paper and pencils , the mixed class of kindergartners and first-graders snuggles up on the reading rug as teacher Marlene McLemore props up a large book called " Tom Fox and the Apple Pie . " <p> As she narrates Tom 's pursuit of the pie , Ms. McLemore throws out an occasional question . " Tom has 13 brothers and sisters . Why would he need 16 pieces of pie ? " An attentive kindergartner pipes up , " because he has a mom and dad ! " <p> Afterward , the children break into small groups to construct and share an apple pie made up of small tiles . <p> Welcome to what 's been dubbed California 's " new-new " math curriculum . Literature-based , hands on , with emphasis on " real world " applications , the curriculum is a reflection of the latest thinking in math education . And it 's as controversial today as was the new math of the 1960s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states where math curricula are being revised , concerned parents are facing off with state boards of education over the new textbooks . <p> Spurred by sinking test scores and new teaching standards issued by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics ( NCTM ) in 1989 , schools around the country have been updating the way they teach math . The Golden State issued a new math " framework " in 1992 , which led to new textbooks in 1994 . The refurbished curriculum , designed to give students greater skills in conceptual thinking and problem solving , began appearing in classrooms last September . <p> But its arrival has sparked a battle over the proper balance between teaching strong critical-thinking skills and adequate preparation in basic computation . And the outcome , given California 's clout in the textbook market , has national implications for how the next generation will learn its numbers . <p> " Every child can and should learn math , " says Jack Price of the NCTM , acknowledging the importance of computational skills . But , he emphasizes , such ability must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because " these kids are going to live in a different world than their parents . " <p> Bob Hamada , mathematics coordinator for the Los Angeles Unified School District also touts the virtues of the new approach . " It is not menu-driven , with the teachers telling students what to do , " he explains . " It has lots of student thinking and investigation , lots of participation . " <p> But many districts , gun-shy after the bitter battles over whole-language versus phonics that erupted nearly a decade ago when the state revised its language curriculum , have been slow to adopt the curriculum . Relatively few of California 's nearly 1,000 school districts have implemented it entirely . Those that have often have found their efforts rewarded with controversy . <p> In San Diego , for example , one of the few cities that has adopted the math texts district-wide , a vocal and well-organized group of parents is actively fighting the new method . <p> Michael McKeown , a San Diego parent and scientist at the world-renowned Salk Institute in La Jolla , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak in basic skills training , " he says , adding that the textbooks cover less material in less depth than either traditional or other alternative math approaches . <p> The consequences of such gaps can be serious . " Students who are not well-prepared in the basics ca n't succeed in math later on , " Mr. McKeown asserts . <p> McKeown is co-founder of " Mathematically Correct , " a loose coalition of some 200 parents concerned about the new-new math finding its way into schools nationwide . The group has a Web page on the Internet and has communicated with concerned parents as far away as England and Australia . " Many of us are scientists and engineers , " McKeown points out . " We know what kind of math you need in the real world . This is n't it . " <p> But Vance Mills , math supervisor with the San Diego Unified School District says the new approach is exactly what students need . " When I taught math , it was all isolated skills . Students did n't have any idea how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new books are more emotional than logical , adding in frustration that " parents want a date that this will all work out , but we wo n't know until we use it . " <p> This experimental attitude is precisely what concerns McKeown 's group . " Our children should not be guinea pigs , " he says . <p> At Dixie Canyon elementary , principal Melanie Deutsch has not backed away from the new texts . But she sees flaws as well , saying they do n't go far enough , thus putting even more strain on her overworked teachers . <p> " Every one of the recommended texts we looked at was lacking in something , " notes Ms. Deutsch , thus forcing individual teachers to create additional materials to fill in the gaps . " Classrooms are full of xeroxes and handouts created and paid for by our teachers , " she adds . <p> But NCTM 's Price says teachers always have filled in the gaps left in curriculum texts with their own materials . " It 's much easier for teachers to add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a page of higher math reasoning , " he observes . <p> Price is concerned about the polarization of parents and educators , saying that the new guidelines were meant to enhance , not replace , the teaching of basic skills . " We have zealots on both sides of this issue , " he laments . " The answer to a good math program is somewhere in the middle . " <p> But , says University of New Hampshire mathematics professor Joan Ferrini-Munday , " controversy is important . " <p> With the nation 's largest textbook market , she says , California can play a crucial role in helping the country shape the kind of the math education that the next generation of children is going to need . <p> " Everyone is concerned about education , " she points out . A national debate , spurred by California 's battles , will help everyone figure out the right balance between basic and higher math skills , she says . <p> Going Fishing for Frogs and Bugs in Math Class <p> With the emphasis on thinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn math armed with scissors and crayons as with pencils and erasers . The following are two games designed for children in kindergarten through second grade . <p> The first is called " The Impossible Game . " Children are given blank spinner patterns , paper clips , and pencils , as well as blue , green , red , and yellow crayons . Each child also receives one yellow , two red , three blue , and four green pattern blocks . They all receive a game board . <p> First , the teacher discusses the concept of impossible versus possible . Could something happen , even though it is not certain ? Or is it out of the question ? <p> Next , the players start spinning for the blocks . The child spins for a color and covers that color block on the board with his blocks . If he spins a color for which he has no block , he loses a turn . Players who use all their blocks , win . <p> After a while , the teacher asks if anyone is close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are invited to offer suggestions for changing the game . <p> The real task of the game only starts after this initial play . The goal is to change the game so it is possible for a player to win . <p> At this point , the children are challenged to design both an impossible and a possible game of their own using the blank spinner and the crayons . <p> Children tackle the concept of prediction with a game called " Going Fishing . " <p> Players receive crayons , and bags with colored tiles : one blue , one red , and 10 yellow . The teacher produces a big book showing frogs diving for bugs . Then , mimicking the frogs , the children " fish " the tiles ( bugs ) out of the bag , taking 10 turns and recording what they got on each turn . ( A multicultural note in the text teaches kids that that frog 's legs are a delicacy in some countries . ) <p> The real task starts at this point . It is to predict what color tile you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors you are more or less likely to pull out .
