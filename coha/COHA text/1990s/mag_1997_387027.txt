When Beth died , Steve lost his wife and Alice lost her best friend How could Alice forgive him now that he was dating someone new ? // Alice could n't remember a time when Beth had n't been a part of her life . From that first day at nursery school , they 'd been closer than sisters . They 'd shared everything , from dolls and dancing lessons to proms and crushes to marriage and motherhood . They were lucky , they 'd often said to each other , that their husbands were friends too . In fact , it was at Alice and David 's wedding that Beth met David 's friend Steve . And when they got married a year later , they moved into a house two blocks away . Now , Alice 's eyes ached with unshed tears as she remembered those early years with babies , first her Elizabeth , then Beth 's Peter , her Robbie , and Beth 's Michael . They lent each other maternity clothes , baby-sat for each other , organized shared family picnics . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , she 'd remind herself , not suddenly . It had been more than two years since the first diagnosis of Beth 's illness , followed by long months of operations and chemotherapy , of hopefulness and losing hope , and then gradual acceptance that she was n't going to get better . Alice was with her through it all . When Steve could n't get off work to take Beth to the hospital for her treatments , Alice went instead , then stayed with her at home afterward . Even then , they managed to find things to laugh about . " Maybe this is my chance to become a blonde , " Beth joked when her hair began to fall out . " How do you think I 'd look ? " " Funny , " Alice told her truthfully , looking at Beth 's brown eyes , and her skin , which was still , then , quite dark . " Not as funny as I 'd look bald , though , " Beth pointed out . As Beth spent longer periods in the hospital , Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boys , now 9 and 12 , after school and being there to listen to Steve . " I feel so helpless , " he confessed one night when he came back from the hospital to pick up the children . " If only there was something I could do . " " But you are , " Alice pointed out . " You 're keeping your home going and you 're keeping things as normal as possible for the boys . " " I could n't do it without your help , " Steve said quietly . And then , even more quietly , he added , " Sometimes , when I leave her , I get this feeling of sheer panic , of wondering what I 'll do when ... " He did n't say any more . But then , he did n't have to . Two months later , Beth died . Steve was with her , and Alice had seen her the day before . So many times she wondered how she could have gotten through her grief without David there to hold her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart broke . There was no one there to ease his loss . She and David did what they could , watching Peter and Michael after school , having Steve to dinner two or three times a week . " I worry most about Peter , " Steve said one night after dinner while the children were watching TV . " He 's hardly cried at all . " ( continued ) " Peter 's twelve , Steve . It 's not an easy age under any circumstances , " she said slowly . But she knew he was right . One day , when all four children came in from school , Alice had just come back from taking their collie to the vet . " Is Glen all right , Mom ? " Elizabeth asked right away . " Yes , " Alice said . " It 's just a stomach bug-he 'll be fine . " Then , firmly , " All right , out of here and upstairs for homework . " Elizabeth and the younger boys hurried out of the kitchen , but Peter stayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be okay , Aunt Alice ? " he asked , stroking the dog 's silky ears . She remembered now how devastated Peter had been when Shandy , his Labrador , had died soon after Beth was diagnosed . She knelt beside him . " Glen 's only six , " she said gently . " He 'll be fine . Shandy was thirteen-he 'd had a good life . " The boy looked up at her , his brown eyes-Beth 's eyes-anxious . " When Shandy died , Aunt Alice , I could n't stop crying . I cried more for Shandy than I have for Mom . " She put her arm around his thin shoulders , searching for the right words . " That was easier , " she said , " You loved Shandy , Shandy loved you , but he was old and ... well , he died . It 's different when you think about your mother . She was too young to die . We all feel that way . She should have been with us , for Christmas , for birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to terms with that , Peter . You ca n't expect it to be easy . " I 'm talking over his head , she thought hopelessly . But after awhile he nodded and got up , looking a little less troubled . A few nights later , she told Steve what Peter had said . " I do n't suppose you could get another dog ? " she asked him . " I think it might help . " Steve shook his head . " Not right now , Alice , " he said . " What with me coming home late . It would n't be fair . Maybe when we get back to something more like a normal way of life . " Soon after that , Steve told Alice that he 'd arranged to do more of his work from home . " So I 'll be there when the boys get home . " " I love having them here , " Alice said . " It 's no trouble . " Steve smiled , and she thought , not for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know , " he said . " We could n't have managed without you , Alice , but ... we have to get on with our lives now . " AFTER THAT , ALICE WOULD BRING OVER A pie or a casserole , and once a week she 'd have Steve and the boys over for a meal . But she was sorry they were n't with her as often ; it felt as if her ties to Beth were slowly fraying . " This is great , Aunt Alice , " Michael said one night , accepting a second helping of meatballs . And then , as his brother glared at him , he added , hastily , " But Dad makes good food too . " " I 'm learning , " Steve said . Across the table , his eyes met Alice 's . " Alice ... " He stopped . " Can I have some more too , please ? " But she had a feeling that was n't what he 'd meant to say . A WEEK OR TWO LATER , SHE CALLED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sunday school was coming up . When a woman 's voice answered , she thought she had the wrong number , and she apologized . " No , Steve 's just gone in to the office . Can I give him a message ? " the woman answered . Alice said no , she 'd call back , and put the phone down . It must be one of Steve 's new neighbors , she thought , that 's all , and dismissed it from her mind . The next night , Steve came over on his own . As Alice poured coffee and he and David talked , she noticed that Steve was beginning to look less strained . Abruptly , in mid-conversation , he put his cup down . " I believe you called last night , Alice , " he said . " Yes , was that your new neighbor who answered ? " " No , " Steve said . " It was Brenda Wilson . From my accounting department . " Alice felt as if there were a tight band around her throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fairly often , " he went on . " I wanted you to know . " Alice shook her head . " You do n't have to tell us anything , Steve , " she said quickly . And then , her voice unsteady , " I ca n't hear about this . " With that , she got up and left the room . In the kitchen , she stood beside the sink , her hands trembling . She could hear the rise and fall of the men 's voices , but she did n't want to know what they were saying . A little later , she heard the front door close , then the sound of Steve 's car driving off . " Alice , love , " David said , coming into the kitchen . He put his arms around her , but she stood stiff and unyielding . " I suppose he told you they 're just good friends , he just needs company ? " she said shakily . David sighed . " No . That 's how it started , but he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've become very fond of each other . " She drew back from the circle of his arms . " It is n't even a year since Beth died , " she said . " How can he do this ? " " I guess it is soon , but Alice , you 've said yourself how lonely Steve must be , and if he and Brenda are right for each other- " " I do n't want to talk about it , " she said . " How can he even think of this woman , when Beth ... I do n't even want to think about it ! " But she could n't forget about it , and the next night , in bed , she said to David , " It 's a rebound thing , that 's all . He 's lonely . She probably just saw a good opportunity- " " Do n't , Alice , " David said sharply . " He wants us to meet her . " He was quiet for a moment , then he went on . " He 's talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there . " She turned away . " Oh , no , " she said . " He ca n't ask that of us-of me . I can at least be loyal to Beth , even if he ca n't . " And then , her voice unsteady , she added , " He should still be mourning . " David 's hand on her shoulder was gentle . " Steve did a lot of his mourning before Beth died , " he said quietly . " What about the boys ? " she asked , trying hard to keep her voice level . " He 's talked to them . He says Michael is taking it in stride , and Peter is cautious , but not resentful . He knew you 'd worry about them , so he wanted you to know how they feel . " He took her hands . " Alice , " he said quietly , " Beth would n't want Steve to be unhappy . You know that . " She tried to pull away , but he would n't let her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't even a year since she died . " Tears ran down her cheeks . When she stopped crying , David said softly , " At least meet her . Give her a chance-give us all a chance . If you do n't , we 'll drift apart . I do n't want that-Steve and I go too far back . The kids do n't want it . " He put his arms around her . " I do n't think you want it either . It 's up to you , Alice . It 's your choice where we go from here . " She knew he was right , but she could n't bear the thought of having anything to do with this woman who 'd made Steve forget Beth so soon . But losing touch with Beth 's sons and with Steve himself would be even worse . Beth would n't want that . The next day she called Steve . " I 'd like to meet Brenda , " she announced . " She 'll be here tonight , " he told her . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want this first meeting to be in Beth 's house . But she stopped herself . She 'd have to get used to seeing someone else in there , in Beth 's place . " Do you want me to come with you ? " David asked , but she said no , this was something she had to do on her own . After supper , she drove over to Steve 's house . It still seemed unbelievable that Beth would n't be there , waiting for her . She still had a key , but she rang the bell . She could see through the glass at the side of the door that it was n't Steve answering and she had a moment 's panic when she remembered he 'd be out picking up the boys from Scouts . But it was too late ; the door was opening . " Alice ? Come in , " Brenda said . She was surprisingly ordinarylooking , not at all the head-turning creature Alice had envisioned . " Steve will be back soon , " Brenda said . She hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like some ? " Alice had been dreading going into Beth 's familiar kitchen with this woman . But the tension was broken completely by the appearance of a small , shaggy puppy hurtling across the room . " We thought it would help Peter , " Brenda explained , as Alice knelt down to return the exuberant greeting . " And has it ? " Alice asked , determined not to give in to sudden panic at the word ive . Brenda nodded . " I think so , " she said tentatively . She poured coffee and set cups on the kitchen table . We used to sit at the counter , Beth and I , Alice thought , and the small difference somehow helped . Now that she was here , she did n't know what to say , and the silence between them stretched awkwardly . " Alice , " Brenda said at last . " I realize how difficult this is for you . I know how close you and Beth were , and how much you did for her , for all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what she 'd wanted to say . " It 's just that it 's so soon . " " I know , " Brenda replied . " We did n't plan it that way . It was just .. we both needed company . And then suddenly we knew we felt more for each other . " This is even harder for her than it is for me , Alice thought , and the realization shook her . She put her mug down on the table . Give her a chance , David had said . Give US all a chance . She took a steadying breath . " Will you and Steve and the boys come for dinner on Saturday ? " she asked . " Yes , we 'd like that , " Brenda replied calmly , but there was relief-and real pleasure-in her eyes . Just then , they both heard Steve 's car pull into the driveway . " Steve will be so glad you 're here , Alice , " Brenda said . " So will David , " Alice said . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just say hello to Steve and the boys-then I have to get home . " It was a start , these few words . It would n't be easy , coming here , seeing Steve and his sons-Beth 's sons-with someone else . But she would do it . It 's choice , David had said , and he was right . She had made the choice , and she knew , with complete certainty , that it was the choice Beth would have wanted her to make . * Isobel Stewart lives in South Africa .
