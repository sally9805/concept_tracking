<p> When Andy Moore dies of AIDS , he hopes to go with quiet dignity . He wants no frantic rush to the hospital , no tubes down his throat and , most of all , no paramedics beating on his chest , trying futilely to steal a few more minutes of life . <p> Moore has a new ally in gaining his wish : the government of Virginia . As he enters the final stages of his disease , he is obtaining a state-issued form that orders paramedics not to revive him if his heart fails . Without the forms , paramedics legally are required to do everything possible to save a dying person . <p> " When I heard about it , I did n't have to take that long to think about it , " said Moore , 33 , of Alexandria . " I do n't want to be one of those people with tubes and wires . I have no unfinished business . When the time comes , that 's the time . " <p> The " Do Not Resuscitate " orders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the terminally ill and their relatives unprecedented power , and sometimes wrenching dilemmas , over when and how death will occur . <p> At a time when physician-assisted suicide has incited a sharp national debate , medical professionals and those who counsel the terminally ill say passive euthanasia , in which a patient is allowed to die through the withholding of medical treatments , has become far more common with far less controversy . <p> In the last four years  --  the same period when voters in two states defeated and Oregon voters approved ballot measures allowing physician-assisted suicide  --  24 other states quietly were approving laws that allowed seriously ill patients to reject cardiopulmonary resuscitation by paramedics . <p> At the same time , court rulings have opened up a wide range of other forms of passive euthanasia  --  such as withdrawing artificially administered food and water or antibiotics to unresponsive patients  --  presenting more families with difficult decisions about when to let a loved one die . <p> " Our whole societal thinking has evolved on these issues , " said Susan D. McHenry , director of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 30,000 Do Not Resuscitate forms since 1992 , when the law was adopted . " More people are choosing to die at home . This is not a matter of not prolonging life . It 's allowing a natural process to take place . " <p> At some Virginia hospices and nursing homes , more than 90 percent of the patients have obtained the orders , which require a physician 's signature . State officials are planning a campaign to further increase public awareness , after a broadening of the law in July that makes non-terminal patients with chronic illnesses eligible to apply . <p> In Maryland , legislators approved such orders last year as part of a bill spelling out patients ' rights , and officials issued draft regulations last week that would allow seriously ill patients to wear a bracelet prohibiting paramedics to perform CPR . Under the previous law , only hospice and hospital patients were eligible . <p> " We 've had very positive experience with this , " said Nancy Taylor , executive of the Montgomery Hospice Society . " It comes as a relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramedics have several methods of resuscitation , including using electrical devices to stimulate the heart . Without CPR , a person 's brain begins to fail from lack of oxygen within three to six minutes . <p> Advocates say the laws are necessary to allow hopelessly ill people to die with dignity , adding that CPR rarely revives frail elderly and other chronically ill people . Without such laws , they say , paramedics are not allowed to honor living wills and must give CPR , even if relatives insist that it is unwanted . <p> In the District , which does not allow Do Not Resuscitate forms , that can lead to clashes between relatives hoping for a quiet death and paramedics fulfilling their legal mission . <p> In one such case this month , relatives held a vigil over Paul R. Minich Jr. , 77 , of the 2800 block of New Mexico Avenue NW . According to relatives and a doctor familiar with the case , Minich , who had diabetes , had wanted to die at home . <p> When he stopped breathing about 11:30 p.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notify officials of his death  --  only to be horrified minutes later when a team of firefighters entered Minich 's condominium and began to resuscitate him . <p> " I heard my mother screaming at the top of her lungs , ' What are you doing ? What are you doing ? ' " said Minich 's son , Paul Minich III , who said firefighters ignored a living will produced by the family . " It was a nightmare . Nobody is aware of this . I 've talked to a half-dozen friends , and they 're all stunned that this is what happens . " <p> David Milzman , an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University Medical School , said that Do Not Resuscitate legislation has been endorsed by the Mayor 's Advisory Committee on Emergency Medicine but that it has remained on the D.C. Council 's back burner for two years . <p> Others , although acknowledging the right to die with dignity , urge caution in employing Do Not Resuscitate forms and other means of withholding medical treatment for the seriously ill . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to take the next incremental step , " said Edmund D. Pellegrino , director of the Center for Clinical Bioethics at Georgetown University Hospital , who strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide . " Over time , you can find that as a result of a number of incremental small steps , you 've made a big step . " <p> According to specialists on dying , the Do Not Resuscitate issue has provoked little debate because it stems from a well-established legal principle : that a person can refuse treatment even if that refusal may be fatal . <p> But other decisions to withdraw medical care have caused greater turmoil , especially for relatives of elderly people , said Hank Dunn , a chaplain at Fairfax Nursing Center and author of " Hard Choices for Loving People , " a booklet that outlines medical and ethical choices for elderly and other seriously ill people and their relatives . <p> Since 1990 , when the Supreme Court ruled that relatives could seek to have artificial feeding tubes removed from unresponsive people , patients and family members have been faced with tougher dilemmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include whether to put a patient on regular doses of morphine while withholding fluids in the last stages of a terminal illness . <p> Such measures are legal and medically ethical if a patient has no hope of recovering and controlling suffering has become the prime medical objective . But Dunn and others said that because those measures are more active than a Do Not Resuscitate order , some relatives feel they are killing a loved one . <p> Those concerns are echoed by opponents of physician-assisted suicide . <p> " My level of concern rises at the point of withdrawing food and water with the intent to cause death , " said James Bopp Jr. , president of the National Legal Center for the Medically Dependent and Disabled . " We should provide at least minimal care . To do otherwise is to get into very hazardous territory of deciding whose life is worth living . " <p> For individuals , ethical concerns often are tempered by a desperate urge to relieve a relative 's suffering . <p> Susan Lowry , 63 , of Arlington , said she remains conflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her 96-year-old mother on morphine without fluids so that she could die peacefully . <p> Lowry said her mother was deeply religious and wanted no medical measures to prolong her life . But , in the end , as congestive heart failure reduced the flow of blood to her brain , Lowry said her mother became more desperate . <p> " We were in the emergency room at Arlington Hospital , and she was saying , ' Oh , Suzy , Suzy , help me , ' praying to God to take her , " Lowry said . " When the doctor came , it was like do whatever you can to take her out of here . " <p> On a heavy dose of morphine , Lowry 's mother died that night . Lowry said she still wrestles with guilt and wishes she had received more guidance from doctors . <p> " Nobody wants to do that . You 're not supposed to be killing your mother , " Lowry said . " I would like the medical establishment to look at how to make this easier for people . @
