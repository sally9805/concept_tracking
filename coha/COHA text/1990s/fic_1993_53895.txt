For Sarah Winter <p> SHE WAS TAKING A WALK , alone , working her way up a knoll through the scattered pines and cedars and the bare hardwoods that rose toward the November sky , when she came upon the faded marble and granite stones . They looked like gray and white ghosts , she thought , rising suddenly from the cold ground , nearly hidden there among the thick , dark trunks of the trees . She felt oddly as though she had made some sort of discovery , a discovery of things that had lain awkwardly in silence and in time . It occurred to her that the dead  --  for each day now-meant more to her than the living . <p> In September , two months before she discovered the stones of the old Caulfield-Hitt cemetery , Lydia Sayre had lain in her own cool sweat at the hospital in Demarville , delivering her firstborn . When the small body had finally slid down , she 'd waited to receive it , to hold it , but she had caught only a glimpse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away . <p> " Boy or girl ? " she 'd gasped . <p> The nurse , a small , dark-complexioned woman , looked at her and answered quietly , " A girl . " The nurse 's face was drawn taut and the lines across her brow were pulled into tight arches . Her eyes were dark . <p> " Is she all right ? " Lydia asked . <p> " We 're going to do all we can , " the nurse answered , averting her eyes , sounding wooden . <p> Later , as she lay in a private room , Robert , still in his work clothes , his hair wet with sweat , hurried to her . <p> " We 've got a little girl , " he had cried , almost like a child , as he leaned over the rail of the hospital bed , clutching the metal . " Our little girl . Can you believe it ? " <p> Exhausted , she could only gaze at him . <p> Two days later the child was dead . Three days later it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was buried . <p> Her first weeks after the death were passed in a kind of numb sorrow , one that seemed to start from some deep and hidden place within her and to spread outward , causing a dull ache even all the way into her wrists and ankles . After a month , and then another , the ache began to give way to a silent , directionless anger , an anger that brought only the strength to feel a deeper pain , an anger turning inward , descending again into sorrow . But the anger , when it rose , also gave her the strength to move . She began to take long walks , sometimes into Riverfield up the narrow asphalt road that she had known all her life , sometimes into the woods behind the house that she and Robert had lived in now two years . <p> After looking in surprise to the stones , wondering vaguely why she had never known they were there , she was now even more startled by the hunter , dressed in dirt-smeared , camouflaged coveralls and sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees below . He had not seen her , she thought , and he looked as if he were a stone himself , a rigid soldier guarding the dead . She remained quiet , watching him until distant noises  --  voices of men and the deep baying of hounds-filtered through the trees ; then she turned and walked quietly back through the woods to the empty house . <p> Robert came home late from the paper mill . After he walked into the house and lay down on the flower-print sofa in the den for a few minutes , she put food out on the table and called him , then sat across from him while he ate . She watched as he unbuttoned his workshirt , and she noticed that the lettering across the front  --  Gulf States Paper Mill-was beginning to fade . He had been in the habit of asking what she 'd done while he was at work , but her answers  --  " just thinking " and " nothing "  --  over the last two months had made him pause and gaze curiously at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid touch of his hand during the funeral , his flesh hard against her , but after that , nothing seemed gentle , living , warm . <p> After she 'd sat for a time staring at the hands in her lap , looking at the blue veins running across her bones , she finally spoke . <p> " You need a new shirt , " she said . Somehow the statement seemed ridiculous . <p> " Yes , " he said , fixing his gaze on her . " Did you walk today ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> She did n't want to say more , and she hoped that he would leave it at that . <p> " Where ? " he asked . <p> " Just out , " she said . As soon as she 'd said it , she realized her tone was wrong . <p> " Just out ? " he half mimicked . " Out where ? You think you might could tell me ? " <p> " I just went for a walk behind the house . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dishes she could carry , then went to the kitchen . She stayed there , washing the dishes with a great and purposeful clatter , banging them vigorously against the sides of the sink , even after Robert had finished eating and had gone to the bedroom . She sat then and watched the small clock that was part of the stove . When the bedroom lights had been out for fifteen minutes , she went quietly to the bed . She lay awake beside him , watching him , listening to him breathe . <p> The graveyard was unguarded when she returned the following afternoon . It seemed at first unnatural to her that the hunter was n't there , that no one watched over the stones , as though some law were being broken . She began to walk among the graves , counting ; there were more than twenty . She kept losing count because of the way the markers were scattered among the old trunks , but it seemed somehow important that she know exactly how many there were . She started over , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle with no beginning or end . She stopped in front of one of the stones which had been pushed up and tilted by the roots of a huge oak ; for a moment she imagined great hands beneath it , pushing the stone slowly from the ground , and she wondered if the remains of the bodies had been disturbed in the same way . <p> She looked again at the other graves . Many were bound on each end by a headstone and a small , square foot marker . She studied the graves more closely and discovered that many of them were small : the graves of children . Some of them had died at two or three years of age , others had lived only a few months ; some had lived only days . The earliest was that of a boy named David Caulfield  --  Born September 23 , 1821 , Died December 26 , 1821 , Son o John D. and Mary J./Taken Back Unto God . She stood back and stared at the almost illegible engraving . She envisioned an empty corridor ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , orange , red , and brown leaves that lay scattered over the boy 's sunken grave . There were rich colors in death , she thought . <p> She moved from stone to stone and saw repeated the names Caulfield and Hitt . Many of the graves were sunken . She found herself wondering if the souls of the people left their bodies only . When:they were buried , causing the earth to slowly hollow out and sink with time . She thought that perhaps a burial was not complete until the grave had sunk . <p> One stone was wedged so tightly between two sweet gum trees that the bark of each of them had grown in around the edges of it , holding it like two great wooden hands . The marker was of light gray stone . The name Margaret Caulfield Hitt was engraved across the top and beneath it the dates July 11 , 1898 , and October 14 , 1919 , And Daughter . <p> She stood for a moment before the stone , puzzling , then she sat down among the leaves beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , Bringing Life , Life was Taken/A Child And Mother Gone To God . <p> She leaned across the sunken grave and ran her hand softly over the stone . It felt rough and cold . She traced the words at the bottom , running her fingertips into the skilled , graceful lettering , staining her fingertips with the dirt of years . She read the dates again , and she realized that the girl had died at twenty-one . She tried then to imagine the young mother , and in her mind an image formed of a small dark girl with long black hair and brooding eyes . The girl was standing , and Lydia saw in her arms what looked to be a child wrapped in a blanket , but she could n't see the child or hear it ; it lay completely still . Slowly , the girl bent forward , her long hair falling loosely in front of her . For a moment Lydia thought she could see the top of the baby 's head , but the blanket still shrouded the child . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demarville , she thought as she walked away from the stone . They owned businesses in the town and were prominent people . But Lydia did n't know any of them ; she only recognized the name , mentioned no.w and then over the years . <p> Robert came home late in the afternoon . His shift had been changed and he got home earlier now . He came into the house , soiled and silent . She began to prepare supper while he bathed , trying to concentrate on the meal , but as she worked at the counter , the image of the girl and the covered child came suddenly to her , moved without her permission into her mind . <p> Robert came from the bedroom . He was clean-s.haven and dressed in a clean shirt and pants . He walked into the kitchen and stood near her , watching her work , not speaking . He was so close that she could smell the soap on his body , and she felt as if he were trying to look inside her , to know what she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted a platter and carried it to the table . <p> " You been out today ? Been nice out , " he said when he came back . <p> " I just walked up the road a short ways , " she said after a moment . <p> She put the rest of the food on the table , and they sat across from one another . The hot smell of the meal filled the room ; it rose from the table and drifted in also from the kitchen . Robert began to talk about work . She listened vaguely and nodded to . the breaks in the rhythm of his voice . <p> " Do you know any of the Caulfields ? " she asked suddenly during a lull in his speech , <p> He paused with his fork halfway up from his plate and looked at her . He smiled and seemed to be glad that she was finally interested in something . <p> " Do n't really know any of them too good , " he said . " Know them when I see them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got money , especially Miss Mamie . She 's a spinster , old as the hills . She do n't get out anymore . " <p> He took another bite of the food . She wanted to press him further , but she held herself back , not wanting to have to explain why she was interested in the Caulfields . <p> " Used to live over here a long time ago , " he finally continued . " Them two big old chimneys that stand out in the woods right back off the road , they was part of their house . " <p> " That 's right . " She remembered now . " Some of the old people used to call that the Caulfield Place . " <p> " They left when it burned . " <p> " When was that ? " she said carefully . <p> " I do n't know . Long time ago . It must 've been a fine house , judging from the size of them chimneys . " <p> She held a book in her lap , staring at the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the words , she found that she could think only about the girl . Robert came into the room quietly and sat down , his shadow moving across the wall in the light from the floor lamp . <p> " You ever see the old graveyard when you were out walking ? " he asked . " That why you 've had the Caulfields on your mind ? " <p> " I 've seen it out there , " she tried to say flatly . <p> " Wish you 'd told me , " he said . " It 's better for you not to be going out there no more . It ai n't good for you . " <p> " How do you know what 's good for me ? " she heard herself snap . <p> " Well , it 's damned sure the dead do n't need you out there . " <p> She went back the next day . The sun shone hard and bright through the trees and reflected dully from the gray and white stones . She sat down beside Margaret Hitt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , then she stared blankly toward the sky that was streaked now with thin clouds . The image came suddenly  --  strong and sharp . The girl stood dressed in a long housecoat , solid black with large black buttons . Her long dark hair was nearly the same color as the coat , looking like a hood as it met the housecoat . Her eyes , although dark , seemed to illuminate the image , to give it a center . Her arms held a blanket that covered the child completely . The heavy , coarse , woolen material was soiled , worn and brown . The child lay motionless under it . Lydia wondered why the girl 's eyes were the center of the image , rather than the child . <p> The sun was slightly higher now , and when she glanced toward it , the glare took the image away . She stood up , brushing leaves from the backs of her legs ; then she began to walk slowly among the other graves . <p> She tried to count the stones again , pointing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few yards , so she made her way through the woods to the road in front of her own house and then decided to walk the short distance to the standing chimneys . <p> The old house had stood at the edge of the woods . Pines and oaks were growing now between the chimneys , seeming to deny the fact that there had ever been human life there . Both of the chimneys were built from large brown bricks . There were fireplaces , filled with dirt and leaves , one positioned slightly above the ground level , the other high in the air where the second story had been . In her mind , she saw the walls anal beams and ceilings and floors surrounding the two chimneys , and suddenly felt the lives of the Caulfields around her . She saw stiffly dressed men and women moving gracefully about on the floor above ; she heard the sound of the children crying , the voices of black women coming from the kitchen , echoing through the rooms , adding warmth . Generations carried on their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rooms before her . <p> With the directory open beside her , she found the name " Mamie E. Caulfield " near the top of a page . Without knowing what she would say , and for a moment feeling that she might be taking things too far , she slowly dialed the number . <p> A black woman 's voice came to her through the receiver . <p> " Caulfield 's residence , " the voice said , the words ringing hard . <p> She hesitated , " Could I please speak with Miss Caulfield ? " <p> " This her nap time . She ca n't talk now . She nap every afternoon . " <p> " Well ... Well , I just wanted to talk to her and see if I could  --  come visit . I live in Riverfield and I wanted to ... I wanted to talk to her about her  --  family . " <p> " Oh ! Yes , Miss . She love to do that . She can go on about her people . She sure can . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a neatly kept lawn . An empty marble birdbath stood in the center of the green expanse . <p> The black woman answered her knock . The woman stood large and very dark , her hands and arms looking as if they could either break a body quickly in half or hold and shelter it as tenderly as they would a child . <p> " Is you the lady what called ? " <p> Lydia nodded . <p> " Well , she been waiting . She love company . " <p> Lydia followed the woman into the house . <p> " She want to tell you all about her people . You got to talk loud . She ninety-three and she ca n't hear too good . " <p> Lydia paused in the dark and cluttered living room . Shelves of old books lined the walls , and a worn family Bible lay open on a walnut stand . It was open only to the inside of the front cover , the page filled with writing . The family 's genealogy , Lydia thought , entered in by generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with precision . <p> The furniture in the room , the chairs and the sofa and tables , were old , hand-crafted : family heirlooms , she thought . The age and dark coloring of the wood seemed to soak up the little light that reached it . <p> In the corner closest to the door was a tall stack of magazines . The women on the covers were stylishly dressed , but for some other time , a time long past . <p> The black woman motioned Lydia out of the living room and down along a hall lined with photographs and portraits , then led her into a paneled den at the far end of the hall . Lydia 's gaze fell immediately on an old woman sitting in a leather recliner . The woman 's face was heavy and wrinkled , her hair tinted a pale blue color , streaks of it looking painted on with a fine brush . <p> " Is that you , Ethel ? " the woman asked . She moved her head in a sort of circle , as if she were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ma'am . And here 's that lady , Mrs. Sayre . " <p> The old woman 's blue eyes brightened , seemed to shine through their white cloudiness . <p> " Oh , do come in , " she said . " I was just now trying to do some recollecting . " <p> The black woman disappeared , and Lydia slowly sat down on the red-velvet love seat that faced the recliner . The strong scent of powder , like age , came to her from the old woman . <p> " I have a real interest in your family , " she said , forming her words slowly . " I live in Riverfield next to your family 's old property and ... " <p> " Yes , yes , " the old woman said , cutting her off . " I was born there in 1896 . In the old house . My grandfather built that house . Worked a crew of negras for a year building it . He was in the war . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . I see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I said I wanted to ask you about your immediate family , your brothers and sisters . " <p> " Why ? They 're all dead . I 've outlived them all ! " The old woman spoke as though she were proud . <p> " How many brothers and sisters did you have ? " <p> " Had four brothers . They 're all dead . " The woman seemed irritated . " Had a sister , dead too . " <p> " About your sister . " <p> " Say again ? " <p> " What was your sister 's name ? " <p> " Margaret . She died a long time ago . Ca n't remember exactly . It 's in the book . I got a book . " Then she stopped , seemed to catch her breath . " He was wounded , you know . " <p> " Who was that ? " <p> " Grandpa , child . Battle of Seven Pines , June of ' 62 . He was shooting Yankees , then they shot him . " The woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my papa was just like him . Everybody said so . " <p> " How old was Margaret when she died ? " <p> " Margaret ? Died during childbirth . " The woman paused , then added as though she suddenly wished to be polite , " She was a sweet girl . " <p> " What did she look like ? " Lydia asked quickly . " Anything like you ? " <p> " Margaret ? Oh , she had light brown hair and sort of light skin . Tall , and slender . We did look something alike . " <p> " You say she had light hair ? " <p> " Almost blond . " <p> " I saw her grave in the old cemetery , that the child was buried with her . " <p> " Yes , yes . Did that some back then . Her husband had it done like that . I got the book . " <p> " The book ? " <p> " Yes , child , the book . Margaret 's book . Kept up with the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . I 'll have it out for you . " <p> " I 'd like that . " <p> The old woman leaned toward Lydia then , as if she were ready to impart something of extreme importance . " Grandpa was buried in that old cemetery too . " <p> She did n't tell Robert where she 'd been , and during that night she barely spoke to him ; she could think only of going back , of finding out more about Margaret Hitt . Robert seemed aware that something preoccupied her . He kept glancing at her as she sat with a book in her lap . She found herself wishing that he would leave the room ; it would be better to be alone than to have him watching her . <p> The book , a slim volume , bound in leather and filled with yellowing but intact pages , lay on a table before the divan in the living room . She was taken directly to it by the black woman who said that Miss Caulfield was n't feeling well , and she was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past time . She turned the pages carefully . Names and dates were listed for births and marriages and deaths , but there were also descriptions of family reunions and church homecomings ; the people who 'd attended were listed , and there were short descriptions of what some of the women wore . <p> The words were written in india ink . Smudges marked the pages here and there , but the lettering was neat , each letter carefully curved to completion . With the succession of each page , the writing filled more and more of each yellowed sheet . The descriptions of events and the reactions to people encountered became longer and more detailed , more personal . <p> As Lydia read in the dim light , she found the entry noting the writer 's marriage : <p> On August 9 , 1917 , I , Margaret Caulfield , married Thomas Alvin Hitt . He is a handsome man who is fine and good . He is very strong and squarely built . He always wins at log rolling . He will make a good life for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding , she thought vaguely of her own marriage and of what she had wanted from it . She remembered what she had expected from Robert , and she wondered what it was exactly that she wanted from him now . She read on . <p> January 28 , 1918 . I will have a child . Thomas has been praying for a child , he says , and we are both happy . Thomas says we need many children and I am glad now that I am in my condition . I hope to have a boy . This is what we need . <p> And , <p> October 4 , 1918 . My child , David Archer Hitt , is dead . ! do not know why . Women have always lost children . It is a part of our heritage and our legacy . I am not the first woman to lose a child . I have been told that I will have a large family and I know that I will . I must think only of the children to come . There will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She studied the fine , fragile curve of the letters , noting where the flow of ink was weakest , where it barely linked all of the parts of the letters together . The words seemed almost unable to stand and to carry their meaning , Another child . So many children . A legacy . She could feel the girl 's grief across the span of time , echoing within her ; but she began to wonder if the girl 's words were really her own , if perhaps she 'd written them only to convince herself of their meaning . <p> My child , David Archer Hitt , is dead , she read again . Something struck her about the words as she took them in . There was something more in them , some quality , some meaning that came from the yellowed pages . Is Dead . Is Dead . <p> She began to move on through the book . A few events were listed : a visit by friends from the next county , mention of a special performance by the church choir , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a child . ! have prayed to God for a healthy boy . This is all that I am concerned with . Thomas seems worried . A child will make him happy again . There is so much work here . Thomas wo n't always be able to do it by himself . He will need help . <p> There were a few more entries , then only empty pages , filling out the book . <p> Lydia closed the volume and took it to the black woman and thanked her . The woman looked up solemnly from the table where she sat folding napkins . She did n't speak . <p> Lydia could hardly concentrate on the road home . The words that the girl had written in the book stayed in her memory , just as they appeared on the page . When she turned off the highway onto the road to her house , the image of the girl and the child wrapped in the blanket came suddenly , left , then came again . The child lay still , covered and silent . Lydia tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could n't . <p> At four o'clock he came in . She lay on the sofa , half awake , somewhere between restless sleep and loose consciousness . She watched him walk into the kitchen , then after a little while reemerge . She 'd had the lights turned off , and in the darkness of the living room he came and sat beside her . <p> " What 's wrong ? " he asked , quietly . <p> " I do n't feel good , " she replied . <p> " You sick ? You need something ? " <p> " No , it 's not that , " she said , looking up at him . <p> He turned away . " Oh . " <p> " I have to talk to you , Robert . Will you listen ? " <p> She could feel him physically brace himself . " Yes , go ahead , " he said . <p> " You know I 've been out in the old cemetery . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " There 's a grave out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childbirth . " <p> " I do n't want to hear this , " he said and began to push himself up . She grabbed his hands , pulled him to her . <p> " Please listen ! " <p> He sat still . <p> " All right , " he said . <p> " I went to see Mamie Caulfield . " <p> " You what ? What 's wrong with you ? My God ! You 're acting crazy . What 'd you say to her ? " <p> " I had to see her . To find out about the girl , her sister . And then I read something about the girl . She had a child who died . Just like us . It only lived a short time , and then she tried to have another , and it killed her . <p> " How can you have done all this ? " he almost shouted . " How do you think you 'll get over this if you keep chasing after the dead ? Leave the dead alone ! " <p> " Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , I do n't know why . " <p> He turned violently from her , shaking . He covered his face with his hands , then ran from the room . <p> She felt numb as she sat alone in the living room , her own hands shaking , her thoughts confused . She thought of Susan Amelia , of Robert . She thought of the long-dead girl and her daughter , of the old woman , and of the graveyard 's scattered stones beneath the trees . <p> She walked slowly up the knoll . The sun was descending and its fiery red , framed by the bare trees , colored the horizon . She reached the top of the knoll and walked among the graves , the light giving the stones a strange amber hue . She made her way to Margaret 's grave and knelt beside it . She felt a closeness now , a deep kinship . Slowly , drawn to it , she moved over the grave and gently lay down on the sunken ground . She looked straight up through the trees at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , feeling protected by the ground . The blanket of leaves beneath her comforted her . She felt as if she were being rocked softly to and fro . <p> The girl and the child came again . The girl stood with the child wrapped in the blanket , still covered . Lydia wanted to see the child . She reached an arm out above her , opening her hand . The girl bent over the child , took it into herself , then turned slightly and faded . Lydia let her arm drop . <p> Is dead . She remembered the words . She said them to herself . Then she remembered other words . Women have always lost children . It is a part of our heritage , our legacy . I am not the first . <p> She took the words into herself , absorbed them the way the now yellowed pages had once absorbed the thick black ink , until they were no longer just words but something solid and whole that found its own place inside her . <p> She lay quietly for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunken ground and stood beside the grave . She read the stone again , then turned and walked down from the graveyard toward home . <p> <p> By MARLIN BARTON <p>
