<p> Stroll down broad Tverskaya Street toward the Kremlin in the heart of this capital and stop for a hot pirozhok pie and cup of kvas at Russkoye Bistro , where the food is cheap , the service swift and the motif thoroughly Russian . <p> The smart orange uniforms , the borscht and tea , even the architecture of Moscow 's newest fast-food restaurant were chosen painstakingly by one man . He personally selected the store emblem : a 19th-century Russian Cossack officer . <p> He then erected a 72-foot-high electric sign in giant letters declaring " Russkoye Bistro . " And the money began rolling in . <p> Russkoye Bistro restaurants are now sprouting up all over Moscow , and no wonder . The man behind them is Yuri Luzhkov , the vigorous , bullying , populist mayor of this metropolis of 10 million people . The squeaky-clean , chrome-and-glass restaurants are just a small glimpse of how Luzhkov is marshaling a new kind of capitalism onto the Russian scene . It is state capitalism , in which the government is the powerhouse  --  choosing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big business by itself  --  and Luzhkov is the muscle man . <p> Soon it may launch Luzhkov toward the Kremlin . <p> From the modern look of Russkoye Bistro , to the golden cupolas of the restored Cathedral of Christ the Savior on the Moscow River , to the massive roof being stretched over Luzhniki Sports Arena , to the giant underground shopping mall nearing completion at Manezh Square  --  Luzhkov has had a hand in all of them  --  no detail of Moscow 's post-Soviet rebirth escapes his attention . <p> He has become the undisputed boss of Russia 's capital , with its lively commercialism , sea of peddlers and traders , and pervasive corruption . <p> President Boris Yeltsin 's long illness has fueled speculation that another power struggle , and possibly a presidential election , looms for control of Russia . If so , Luzhkov , 60 , barrel-chested and bull-headed , a one-time Soviet administrator who transformed himself into a disciple of profit , is increasingly described as the candidate who could represent the moneyed and progressive interests of today 's Russia  --  those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free markets and democracy . <p> The fight for power in Russia is a contest between powerful clans , and Luzhkov sits atop one of the mightiest of these ruling oligarchies , a Moscow group of politicians , city agencies , banks , businessmen and security forces . He faces one serious liability : In the decaying provinces , there is resentment of the prosperous capital . But Pavel Bunich , an adviser to Luzhkov and a member of parliament , predicted this envy would recede " once people see there are no potholes on the roads . " <p> In recent months , Luzhkov has been sounding off on national themes , and polls show his ratings are inching upward . Among Moscow 's political elite , he is increasingly seen as the only political figure capable of doing battle with Alexander Lebed , the popular but authoritarian retired general who also hungers for the presidency . <p> " I 'm not planning to join this wild , false start of a race , " Luzhkov protested recently . But he added , " The absence of the president for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The Builder <p> Just after the 1991 coup attempt , then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was equivocating about whether to resign from the Communist Party when he was visited by Gavril Popov , a mild-mannered professor who was then Moscow 's mayor , and his deputy , Luzhkov . It looked like Gorbachev would try to hang on , Popov recalls in a new memoir . <p> " Then Yuri Luzhkov began to speak , " he said , " with all of that manager 's forcefulness of his . Luzhkov 's vigor turned out to be a complete surprise . The decision to leave the party was taken . " He " practically dictated the text " of Gorbachev 's departure statement . <p> Luzhkov 's forcefulness soon came to dominate the city . A one-time manager in the Soviet chemical industry , he succeeded Popov as mayor in 1992 . He saw that results mattered , not showcase statistics . Amid the chaos of those first years after the Soviet collapse , Luzhkov was an achiever , a builder  --  and people noticed . <p> " We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an independent person , one who practically has no doubts , who quickly solves concrete problems , " said Alexei Venediktov , news director of Echo of Moscow , a radio station . <p> Residents found that the city became cleaner , and more functional , than at any time in memory . Luzhkov opened new subway stations . He paved rutted roads . He began rebuilding the treacherous Moscow beltway into a 10-lane superhighway . Food became plentiful at outdoor wholesale markets , though many of the burgeoning street markets became unruly magnets for criminals . <p> Most importantly , he struggled to alleviate the pent-up demand for housing . He built 32 million square feet of new apartment space each year . He sold apartments to the rich and used the proceeds to pay for fresh housing for tens of thousands of families who had been on municipal waiting lists for years . It was a classic Luzhkov trade-off , soaking the rich to help others . <p> Luzhkov had a powerful helping hand : Moscow was ripe for change . It became a magnet for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money to the federal budget than did any region . Moscow has the most reform-minded electorate in the country and last year returned Luzhkov to office with 88 percent of the vote . <p> But he has had his failures , especially runaway crime . The city is rife with mafia gangs and protection rackets ; bribery , kickbacks and secret overseas bank accounts are day-to-day facts of life ; car bombs and contract murders have become common ways to settle disputes ; and neither the corruption nor the violence has been brought under control by the city 's weak law enforcement authorities . Last year , an American businessman , Paul Tatum , who was involved in a legal dispute with a city agency over a hotel property , was slain on the street . His killer was never found . Corruption here begins with traffic police who demand bribes and reaches into the higher echelons of business and government . <p> Luzhkov has sanctioned brutal tactics against the city 's homeless , forcibly removing them to distant villages , and the police often arrest and rough up dark-skinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye on Moscow 's 850th anniversary celebration this autumn , Luzhkov has been erecting monuments to Russia 's revival , both spiritual and commercial . In the tradition of Robert Moses , who shaped much of 20th-century New York City , Luzhkov has been the driving force behind several projects that are already reshaping Moscow 's skyline . <p> Gangly construction cranes now tower over Luzhniki Stadium , where a 10,000-ton steel ring is being put in place to support a 140-foot-high , 12-acre sliding roof of glass-reinforced plastic . It will be Europe 's largest roofed stadium . Although short of cash , the city has already poured $ 36 million into the project . <p> Not far away rises the 334-foot-tall dome of the ornate Cathedral of Christ the Savior . Built by the Russian Orthodox czars in the 19th century to commemorate the victory over Napoleon , the cathedral was dynamited by Stalin in 1931 . It has been elaborately  --  and critics say excessively  --  reconstructed . The finances are murky , but the final cost has been estimated at $ 300 million . <p> Nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manezh Square underground shopping mall , three stories and 84,000 square yards of retail and office space , much of it still vacant . And on the banks of the river , a huge and , in the view of many , ugly statue of Peter the Great is rising into the sky , designed by Luzhkov 's court sculptor , Zurab Tsereteli . <p> Most of Russia today has fallen into hard times reminiscent of the Great Depression in the United States . So , the question often arises , how did Luzhkov pay for all of it ? <p> The Empire <p> In the center of town , Inkombank , Russia 's third-largest bank , is located at 4 Slavyanskaya Square . The building , erected in 1913 , was a business center before the Russian Revolution , but fell into disrepair in Soviet times . Now it has been restored , and offers a clue to how Luzhkov built an empire . <p> After the Soviet collapse , privatization chief Anatoly Chubais oversaw the largest transfer of state property to private hands in history . Factories , buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to new , private shareholders  --  including every Russian citizen , who received a voucher for his or her share of state property  --  at a fraction of its true value . <p> But in Moscow , Luzhkov stopped the Chubais plan cold . " Like a drunk , " he said of Chubais , " he sold off everything in the house . " In 1994 , Yeltsin personally gave Luzhkov control over Moscow 's vast inventory of state property . Ever since , he has been cashing in . Last year , officials said , the city took in $ 1 billion in privatization revenues , more than all of the federal privatization effort . <p> When Inkombank , a new , post-Soviet bank , was interested in the old building on Slavyanskaya Square , the city simply gave it the building , in exchange for a promise to restore it , and a long-term lease . Now , the refitted headquarters gleams with an elegant , turn-of-the-century look . Luzhkov came to the ribbon-cutting . The bank 's president , Vladimir V. Vinogradov , has become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral of Christ the Savior . " We have close business ties with the city , " said bank spokesman Alexei Shatalov . " We have partnerships and commercial relations . " <p> This cozy relationship is multiplied a thousand times . According to many business people , Luzhkov used property as leverage . The property was leased for a nominal sum , but the city also made unwritten demands not in the lease : to plant trees , rebuild a hospital , pave a highway . <p> Luzhkov " has certain levers which make it possible for him to thank sponsors , " said Bunich , his adviser . " If you are a businessman , it would certainly be better to have an office in the center , near the Kremlin . Luzhkov can do it for you . " Or , in exchange for credits , Bunich said , Luzhkov can give banks the coveted designation of " authorized , " meaning they can share in lucrative city business . " Luzhkov can establish rent from zero  --  skywards , " he added . <p> Popov said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-open scramble for valuable property . " One-third of this is taking a legal way , " he said . " One-third is taking a traditional Communist way of a fight under the rug , so to speak . And one-third is mafiosi ways . " <p> For example , Luzhkov was eager to clean up an old dump filled with dangerous toxic waste , which he called an ulcer on the city . An excavation firm , Moscow Mechanized Construction No. 5 , agreed to take on the hazardous task . The company removed 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated soil , working around the clock for two years . The company also needed help . It had purchased $ 10 million in new dump trucks from Volvo , but still owed $ 3 million it could not pay . Luzhkov came to the rescue . He arranged a loan from a local bank , at 4 percent interest , when market rates were far higher , so the company could settle the debt . <p> In another case , Ren TV , a prominent television production company , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its president , Iren Lesnevskaya , the company needed capital . Luzhkov helped secure a $ 20 million loan from a bank partially owned by the city and he is now chairman of the board of Ren TV . <p> Galina Starovoitova , a progressive member of parliament from St. Petersburg , said Muscovites cheer when Luzhkov squeezes wealthy banks and businesses for his special projects  --  ecology , television , housing . " A lot of ordinary people think these new rich , these new Russians , should share their wealth with the city , " she said , " and this is a way to cut , a little bit , their super-profits . " <p> Luzhkov has also squeezed the federal government . Yevgeny Yasin , the economics minister , recently noted that Moscow 's anniversary festivities are nearing . " I am scared to death of this anniversary , " he said , " because I know that Luzhkov will clamor for additional spending . " <p> Moscow Inc . <p> Not only does Luzhkov oversee a treasure-trove of property , but the city is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformers sought to tear down the state , Luzhkov has reinforced it . Some call it state capitalism . Others charge it is monopolistic and anti-competitive . <p> Vladimir P. Vinogradov , manager of the city property administration , said Moscow runs 1,500 businesses , mostly former Soviet state-owned enterprises . In another 300 firms , the city is a partner with outside investors . The businesses include bakeries , hotels , construction , publishing , banking , aviation and communications firms , beauty salons , an oil refinery and a pair of giant , troubled automobile factories . <p> Popov said Moscow has free markets : Individuals hawk their wares on street corners . But when it comes to the city enterprises , he added , " even the words ' state capitalism ' would be too flattering . Because actually we are not dealing with state capitalism , we are dealing with a variety of monopolies . " <p> The power of Moscow as a business empire can be seen in the founding of Russkoye Bistro . Luzhkov wanted a truly Russian fast-food joint to compete with the phalanx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russkoye Bistro and contributed real estate , cheap utilities and preferential credits . According to Vladimir Pivovarov , deputy general director , Luzhkov fussed over the enterprise as if it were his own . " Everything we sell , " he recalled , " was tasted by the mayor himself . " <p> But Luzhkov 's grandest commercial venture has many people wondering if he has reached too far : The city has taken control of the moribund Zil truck factory here . Once a crown jewel of Soviet industry , the factory made only 17,000 vehicles last year . The city borrowed $ 44 million from a consortium of Russian banks  --  with one of its hotels as collateral  --  for the project . Rather than top-to-bottom restructuring to make the factory more competitive , Luzhkov 's plan has a state capitalist angle : City agencies will be ordered to buy more Zil trucks , tax breaks will be doled out , parcels of land will be sold off , and advertising will be created for Zil . Yasin said Luzhkov is also seeking federal aid . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zil trucks . <p> On a smaller scale , many of Moscow 's small business people complain they are constantly required to pay bribes for routine business . One storefront owner said , " To get permits is very difficult and takes a long time . Very often you have to pay people off , and you 're happy when you can . " <p> He said every business in the city employs a krysha , or roof , a paid mafia protection racket . Sometimes the krysha is one and the same as the local police force . " It 's not my biggest concern , " he said . " At least I know there is someone to call . " <p> Luzhkov is almost never criticized in the Russian media . One reason : He is genuinely popular . Another : He is extraordinarily powerful . <p> The Boss <p> Luzhkov , who refused to be interviewed for this article , does not take criticism lightly . By his own count , he has filed and won 25 slander suits in Moscow courts , " and got rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio station news director , said the news media realize that an angry Luzhkov could easily close them down . " Newspapers are n't ready , " he said . " This could bankrupt them . " <p> In fact , the city helps many news media outlets , giving them low rents , tax breaks and discounts on electricity bills that Luzhkov has estimated are worth $ 15 million a year . Venediktov said the station got a check for about $ 10,000 to pay for a year 's subscription to the Reuter news service . <p> Luzhkov rarely discusses his family and private life , but in public he is a colorful and energetic politician who often is seen touring construction sites , riding a new bus , jumping into a frigid river or answering call-in questions on local television . <p> Despite his denials , it is clear Luzhkov is looking beyond Moscow . He is a " romantic " who thinks he has a mission to transform Russia , Venediktov said . " Moscow has become a modern city . And so Russia will become modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIGARCHY AND THE CAPITAL 'S FREEWHEELING COMMERCIALISM <p> Here is a selection of major businesses in which the Moscow city government holds a substantial share .
