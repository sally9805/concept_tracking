In the days of a navy under sail , a ship 's greatest fire power could be brought to bear when the warring vessel closed in on its adversary , brought its broadside about to either port or starboard side , and fired explosive volleys from its cannon . Captains , maneuvering their warships , tried to avoid volleys from the broadside of an opposing vessel because those were the most feared and attention-getting that could be brought to bear . <p> Somehow , in colonial America , the term broadside came to be the vernacular for a form of public announcement . Great and not-so-great debates were often conducted through the use of broadsides . In the pre-Revolutionary period , a broadside was a message printed on one side of a single sheet of paper , intended for distribution or posting in a prominent public place . Broadsides were first a form of public argument . Some were serious , and some , intended for humor , lampooned a position on an issue or a person taking that position . <p> The term broadside was applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by governments , announcements by agency rule makers , positions declared by advocates on this issue or that were called broadsides . In many ways , these were the precursors of posters . In other ways , they were like " bills " ( or advertisements ) from which the English got the terms handbills and billstickers , and we got the word billboards . The broadside 's purpose was to seduce , exhort , sell , inform , or command , and the broadside often had something more  --  a heated or humorous presentation on a civic issue . It was , in its day , the medium of mass communication . <p> Today , these old broadsides are vivid historical source materials . If students can learn to use broadsides effectively as historic documents , they can learn skills associated with historical scholarship . With the selection and use of appropriate , issue-oriented broadsides , our students will be better informed and more versatile in applying those skills associated with effective citizenship . The Tradition of Broadsides <p> Throughout ancient history , governments communicated by promulgating their laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylonia proclaimed his code on stone pillars . Asoka in Buddhist India erected stone stupas along highways to remind subjects and visitors alike of the behavior expected within his realm . Roman authorities posted laws on bronze tablets in the marketplace of the Eternal City . <p> Ancient wall paintings from Egypt used words , pictures , and other symbols to communicate . The Greeks engraved announcements for public consumption . Bas-reliefs in early China and India were used in conspicuous locations to communicate information . Modern archaeologists uncovered poster-like inscriptions that used emphatic graphics to convey messages to the public . <p> Before popular newspapers and the mass media , such posted public announcements were the most economical and effective method to reach the greatest number of people . The advent of the printing press made communication easier and less costly . Governments could make announcements , declare edicts , and proclaim policies by posting or circulating printed sheets . Declarations of war , local ordinances , news about forthcoming celebrations , announcements of executions , warnings about fugitives , and the levying of taxes were regularly posted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public communication . Royal decrees , Acts of Parliament , and the dutiful details of public administration appeared on walls and along byways . Political leaders , groups , and pundits picked up on broadsides . Broadsides were suited for quickly printing an opinion on public issues . Arguments were set forth , in prose and verse . Editorials , lampoons , poems , moralizing commentary , humorous ballads , satirical prose on public issues , both secular and religious , were commonplace . These popular uses of broadsides were not lost on business persons who seized upon the medium for advertising goods and services . <p> The British colonists brought the use of broadsides to the New World . The first printing presses in the English colonies were used to print broadsides to report events , to announce rules and policies , and to spread ideas , both religious and secular . The Crown and the colonial governments used broadsides regularly , trying to inform and to persuade colonists to accept and support their programs . Individuals used broadsides to spread their views , whether serious or amusing , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown began to part ways in the mid-eighteenth century , the broadside was as popular as the printed pamphlet , for sharing views and arguments . The Declaration of Independence , for example , was first printed as a broadside to be distributed and posted throughout the Thirteen Colonies . <p> Broadsides emerged from the American Revolution as a popular vehicle for informing Americans and for disseminating competing positions on public issues . The broadside served as a means of mass communication until the late nineteenth century when the color poster replaced it . The poster , in turn , was supplanted by the electronic media-first radio and then television . An Instructional Model for Using Broadsides <p> History teachers can use broadsides from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as historical documents and as springboards for students ' consideration of the historic issue presented and any contemporary parallels in the students ' own time and place . The following six-step model provides one process that engages students and helps them to develop higher-level thinking skills appropriate to historical inquiry and public-issue decision making . <p> Step 1  --  Orientation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into historical context , checking student comprehension of the text and the concepts used . <p> Step 2  --  Specific Concerns Reflected in the Broadside . The teacher assists the students in identifying the concerns : What is happening ? How was this evaluated ? Why is this a matter of concern to the author(s) of the broadside ? <p> Step 3  --  Specifc Actions Recommended or Announced . The teacher directs the students to identify the recommendations of the broadside 's author(s) : What is demanded or recommended ? How do the recommendations relate to the concerns noted above ? What is the " agenda " of the author ? <p> Step 4  --  Assumptions and Justifications . The teacher has the students identify and analyze the justification offered for the recommended actions . If that is not explicit in the broadside , they infer the justification . Actions reflect prescriptive value judgments and thus require justifications . <p> Step 5  --  Opposing Points of View to That Given in the Broadside . The teacher may use another broadside with a contrasting point of view or refer students to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the initial broadside . <p> Step 6  --  Enduring Issues . The teacher should help students link the concerns in the broadside to broader historical issues or trends and to any contemporary parallels in the students ' own time and space . Sample Lessons <p> The following lessons provide examples for the classroom use of historic broadsides . The first lesson uses two broadsides from the National Archives , Washington , D.C. ( Broadsides 1 and 2 ) . The second lesson uses a single broadside from the American Antiquarian Society , Worcester , Massachusetts ( Broadside 3 ) . The third lesson uses a single broadside from the National Archives ( Broadside 4 ) . Each lesson uses the six-step instructional model in ways appropriate to the historical topic . Lesson 1 : King George III 's Proclamation and the Congressional Response , 1775 <p> When leaders in the thirteen English colonies along the Atlantic coastal frontier began their rebellion , King George III responded with a proclamation that appeared as a broadside , dated August 23 , 1775 . During the orientation process , the teacher should place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the textbook , checking student comprehension of the broadside . In early printing , an s appears like an f . Notice that the king speaks of subjects , not " citizens , " who owe " allegiance " to their " lord , " the king of England . Students should note that the king speaks of " rebellion , " not " revolution . " <p> The king 's concern is with the rebellion of some colonists , whom he sees as threats to commerce , peace , and the security of loyal subjects . His loaded language reflects the Crown 's concern for the continued control of the colonies and the increasing costs of such control when faced with rebellion . The teacher might have the students focus upon the loading of the language used and how this might further enflame those " rebellious subjects . " <p> What action does the king recommend ? He proposes that his " loyal subjects " turn on their fellow colonists and inform on them to the king 's authorities in the colonies . To the " disloyal " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience . <p> The king offers little in the way of justification for his order to the loyal subjects or to the rebellious . The broadside is a threat  --  a warning to all about the forthcoming judgment by English authority and power . In this proclamation , the king makes assumptions about the responses of those who are loyal and those who are not , and about the ability of the Crown to impose its will by persuasion or force upon the colonists . <p> The second broadside ( Broadside 2 ) offers the opposing point of view . On December 6 , 1775 , the Continental Congress responded with its broadside . The teacher and students should repeat the process of orientation , analyzing the concerns , recommended actions , and justification . Students might use parallel columns in their notebooks to make the comparison clear . The debate focuses upon the two understandings of " allegiance , " with the colonists ' view of " rights " as " citizens , " in contrast to the king 's view of the " duties " of " subjects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Parliament 's power and authority . In addition , the colonists argue that they , too , have the right to respond forcefully to those who oppose their decisions . The colonists ' argument assumes the need for justification , and the broadside provides explicit reasons for the colonists ' behavior . <p> The teacher and students might identify the different enduring issues stemming from this debate . One such issue concerns the obligation of persons to inform on others who do not fulfill their duty as it is seen by those in authority . What is one 's obligation to come to the aid of lawful authority when it is under siege ? Another enduring issue concerns oppression . What is considered oppression , and what are the general obligations of persons who see themselves as oppressed or see others as being oppressed by lawful authority ? A third enduring issue involves the right to rebel . When do subjects or citizens have the right to rebel ? What are the obligations of others when persons do rebel ? In our own country , problems related to civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as guaranteed by the First Amendment revolve around enduring issues . Activities in the Republic of South Africa , the north of Ireland , and Afghanistan are also contemporary instances where the enduring issues emerge as headlines and news bites for students . Lesson 2 : Lyman Hall , Proclamation on Respecting Indian Lands , June 13 , 1793 <p> This broadside by the governor of Georgia can serve as a springboard into the issue of Indian lands and rights in the new nation . Land speculation and the desire to expand settlement into Indian lands is a recurring theme throughout the early centuries of the American experience . In the case of Georgia , demands and land schemes ( including the Yazoo Land Fraud ) were infamous . Initially , those Indian lands were to be respected by international treaty and by Georgia law . By the late 1 820s , however , pressure mounted . The Georgia legislature passed a law in 1828 that no Indian laws were to be effective after 1830 . A federal law in 1830 called for the removal of the Indians . Creeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia law requiring that non-Indians living on Indian lands have a state license was tested in the courts . It was the Supreme Court under John Marshall that decided the case of Worcester v. Georgia in 1832 . The Marshall Court upheld the supremacy of international treaties between the United States and the Indian nations and declared the Georgia statutes unconstitutional . Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler , New England missionaries , had the right , with Indian permission , to live and work on Indian lands without any permission , license , or interference from Georgia officials . <p> A teacher using this proclamation by Governor Lyman Hall should begin by placing it in historic context , ask students to read it , and then check their comprehension by asking questions . In this orientation to the broadside , the teacher should direct the students to reflect upon the use of the term Indian nation . Governor Hall refers to the Indian lands as those of the Indian nation , not tribes . The significance of that label will become apparent later in the lesson . Students should look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western land claims stretched to the Mississippi River . This was the land that Governor Hall envisioned in Georgia when he issued his proclamation . <p> Once students are oriented in time and place , they might turn to Governor Hall 's concerns . What worried him ? Why be concerned about encroachment upon Creek and Cherokee lands ? Then the students can identify the actions that Governor Hall and state authorities took in response to such encroachment . Why a license ? Who will grant the license ? Did the governor 's proposed actions follow logically from his concerns and evaluation of the issue ? How did the governor justify his proposed actions ? What assumptions did he make about the impact of past encroachment ? About the likelihood of nonencroachment in the future ? The governor 's purpose seemed clear , but did he have the authority and power to bring about the desired effect ? <p> The teacher and students might turn to opposing points of view . These will have to be inferred . If persons were encroaching upon Creek and Cherokee lands , why were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over hunting grounds ? What were the economic and social rewards for this activity ? What did the term Indian lands mean to these people ? How were they likely to view the authority and power of the State of Georgia in the restriction of their activities ? These considerations set up the conflict that intensified with resource discoveries on Indian lands and added pressure for opening such lands to agricultural settlement . <p> The enduring issue that teachers and students might consider is one of power . How does this instance compare with other cases in history of forced relocation ? Groups without power have great difficulty in defending their resources and rights when confronted with demands by outsiders with power . By the 1830s , the Creeks and Cherokees in Georgia were " removed " westward . Political realities and economic demands overwhelmed rightful and legal treaty restraints . This pattern was repeated in American history , and the tension continues today with the exploitation of resources on native American lands , such as coal resources in the Four Corners area , fishing rights in the Northwest and Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murderer of Our Late Beloved President , Abraham Lincoln , Is Still at Large , April 20 , 1865 <p> The students ' textbooks report the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln , but this broadside is a colorful springboard to the feelings that this act aroused among the unionists . This broadside also serves to raise some issues that endure today . <p> The teacher will need to orient students to this broadside . First , the assassination of Lincoln must be placed in historic context . Students might review the facts presented in their textbooks . The teacher then offers the broadside and asks students to read it . ( Some may have seen similar " wanted " posters in the local post office or , in some communities , on television ) . Before proceeding , the teacher needs to check students ' comprehension of what they have read in the broadside . <p> A time line may be helpful . Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth at 10:15 P.M. on April 14 , 1865 , in Ford 's Theatre while the president watched a performance of Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell ( alias Payne ) attacked Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home and wounded him . The president died the next morning at 7:39 A.M. ( April 15 , 1865 ) . The broadside was printed and distributed on April 20th . Booth was surrounded in a barn near Bowling Green , Virginia , on April 26th . The barn burned to the ground , presumably with Booth still inside . Of the nine others implicated in this crime , four were hanged on July 7th , and four were imprisoned . The jury failed to convict the ninth accused co-conspirator , John H. Surrat . <p> The students should identify the source of this broadside , asking themselves , " Who published the broadside ? " " What was their concern ? " " What did they hope to accomplish ? " Students should note that the broadside came from the War Department , not civil authorities . They should notice that the persons named were not mentioned as accused persons , but as persons evaluated as guilty  --  murderer and accomplice are the labels used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trial or hearings . <p> The broadside 's authors detailed the recommended actions to be taken . Those actions were to be motivated by handsome rewards , in terms of the standards of the time . The War Department was offering the rewards listed , but additional rewards ( up to $200,000 ) were possible from municipalities and/or states . The broadside urged citizens to do their duty and give information to the authorities . It also warned them of the serious consequences of aiding the accused . <p> The justification for this recommended action was implied , not directly stated . The assumptions , which students should identify , were twofold . First , it was assumed that Booth and his accomplices or co-conspirators were guilty . Second , it was assumed that citizens needed extra incentives , in terms of dollars , to do their duty in providing information to the authorities . Both of these assumptions should be matters for student reflection . An unquestioned assumption here is in the application of the death penalty for presidential assassins found guilty . <p> No opposing points of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbooks about southern attitudes toward President Lincoln 's first election and subsequent administration . Bitterness prevailed in the hearts of many . The broadside revealed some concern about this bitterness in its warning to those citizens who might aid the fugitives and in its statement about the severe penalties for such assistance . <p> The teacher and students have at least four enduring issues in American history upon which to focus their attention . The first is the use of political assassination as a means to achieve political power or political change . The second is the continuing use of monetary or other extrinsic rewards to motivate citizens to do their duty . The third is the continued application of the death penalty in thirty-eight states and public debate over additional uses of capital punishment upon conviction for a range of federal offenses ( e.g. , drug trafficking , espionage ) . Another enduring issue to consider is the War Department 's engagement in law enforcement in 1865 in Washington . The public today debates the proper limits of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal drug trafficking turned , in part , on concern about military involvement in civilian , political , and judicial arenas . Conclusion <p> In the late nineteenth century , with the availability of newspapers , popular magazines , and color lithographed posters , broadsides were relegated to the post office wall . Wanted posters and cheap advertising bills were all that was left . Nonetheless , history teachers and their students can readily obtain broadsides for use in classes . Local museums and historical societies may have broadsides that can be used in the classroom . Upon request , state archives , historical societies , and museums are most willing to provide teachers and their students with low-cost copies of broadsides . The National Archives and Records Administration in Washington , D.C. , its presidential libraries , and regional centers are superb sources for broadsides . Libraries with a solid history collection will have book-length collections of broadsides , such as those listed in the bibliography . <p> For teachers and students of local , state , and national history , broadsides are one vivid record of the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our past . They show the emotions and values that moved people . Broadsides show that the pointed question of a Sam Donaldson of ABC , the entertaining wit of a Mark Russell of PBS , and the moral fury of a Jessie Jackson had antecedents in the endeavors of those in the past who used broadsides as their medium . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Broadside 1 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Broadside 2 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Broadside 3 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Broadside 4.
