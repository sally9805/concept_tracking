In heaven there is no beer . That 's why : <p> There was a bar outside of Pigeon Forge , crawled back onto a flat space hanging off its mountain , where someone , seemingly inspired by great forces , had seen the fiction of her body , and in tribute rendered it fantastically , overwhelmingly , in fluorescent paints across the entirety of the back wall . The unregistered image of Dolly 's hair , Dolly 's breasts , Dolly 's hips , and Dolly 's lavender , blood-tight jumpsuit was depicted in glorious , drowning sexism , making what seemed to be an almost patriotic appeal to the tongue and eyes , a body enthusiasm so palpable that upon seeing the painting and recognizing its subject for what she was , Brian felt physically slowed by it . He stopped in the doorway and clutched himself with his invisible arms . He sensed that the painting was hungry for northern flesh . <p> He chose his seat carefully , assuming a stool at the bar which put him in direct confrontation with the mammoth ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her crotch intersected in such a way that his eyes were quite naturally led to the display of top-shelf liquors  --  this way to the Chivas , almost . This quirk of composition may have been purposeful genius on the part of the artist , but considering the work as a whole , Brian suspected it was not . It was impossible to see the entire painting properly in such cramped quarters , as she had been painted , or applied , directly on the back boards with all the intent and majesty of a tobacco advertisement on the side of a barn . The bar itself was too close-walled and elongated , like a generous , ill-lit corridor , and Brian had the brief sensation of being a passenger on a ship in a bottle . <p> And yet this was not his first encounter with the work of visionaries . At least not since he had left his home and his wife , that first life , behind . After all , he had seen the temple through the trees : the palace in West Virginia , Krishna gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No , that was n't true . It could n't be . No kind of preacher would have his temple in all of that gray . Bhahatapur . . . Bhatapa-pa . . . what was that guy 's name ? He was supposed to be some kind of really big deal , a Krishna Pope or something . Better , a Krishna Joseph Smith . Brian had seen his photo in a magazine article and was struck by the exotically musical name attributed to this mundane-looking bald guy with glasses . With glasses , of all things . The sign must have spelled it out , must have , and he could almost see it  --  Bhapapa . . . no . And now he remembered that sign , quite clearly . It was a billboard sneaking up along with others as he 'd rounded the curves of the overpass . Not the real thing at all . <p> And that fake preacher with the Sears economy glasses  --  he had an awful lot of things that should n't be his , did n't he ? A golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at that . What a strange life . It was n't that Brian envied him exactly , but still . He had that beautiful name . <p> Brian wished he could remember what it was . He wondered what perfect syllables he 'd string together if he were the one who got wrapped in sheets and had to choose a new name for himself . It was so clear now , he felt embarrassed . The sign , with its cartoon-painted dome , existed in the same stinking , airy field as other , less ridiculous images : radio call letters , news personalities , cigarette boxes , and giant women dressed in black velvet . It was almost like television , like the driving and the seeing were no more real than a long , boring , made-for-TV movie . <p> Things were slipping , melting together . Before he 'd left , Madeline , his wife , had pronounced him dead , said he was " cracking up . " Cracking , strange word . The billboard over Huntington , he 'd at least seen that . Proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were , at least , worlds behind worlds . It was the kind of evidence that would set him off , make him over-think , causing a little ghost to churn up heat in his upper chest where he 'd once had an ulcer in his esophagus . <p> The Krishnas had advertised their heaven like a theme park or a Stuckey 's . And maybe he 'd really seen what they meant . Maybe he did see a temple , but he 'd thought it was real . Gold , and then the green , and then the gray clouds , and then pure white smoke coming up from the industrial chimneys over Huntington , enveloping Hatfields and McCoys and Hare Krishna Babbadabba . . . almost heaven . Was that it ? <p> The television was on , down by Dolly 's head . Brian could make out that it was a James Bond movie , but he did n't remember which . The villain was a black guy with a hook for a hand or something , and he was throwing a plate of pale meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The muscles in Brian 's shoulders began to tighten , reacting to a nonexistent cold wind . He wanted to contain this habit of nursing his own sensual distortions . To calm himself , Brian sought the predictability of the veneer-topped bar ; he traced the wood-grain patterns , his rigid fingertip acting as an agent of total concentration . <p> Because Dolly was in a relaxed , lounging pose , on her side , her hair punched into an oceanic swell by her own enormous hand , one end of the bar was more crowded than the other . Regulars , Brian figured , privileged seating . It was tough to get served down where he was . The yellow light from the hot dog case cast mostly up , on the Breasts , but the arm 's length of cleavage appeared blue . For a moment , the bartender 's head was turned just right , and was haloed by Dolly 's top nipple . <p> Brian heard music , barely . A woman moaning from a dislocated radio . He wondered if it was her , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to be so associational . " I need a draft down here . Anything . " He was noticed at last . " And a hot dog . Plain . " The bartender moved to serve him , but Brian could only sense that from his peripheral vision , as he could n't prevent his gaze from straying toward the splendor of the Dolly . <p> " Plain ? " repeated the bartender . <p> " Yeah  --  um , I mean yes , thank you . " Brian knew he . should try to sound less distracted , be cool , but he could n't help himself . His mind , such as it was , swirled . His eyes sort of ached from the expanse , the work of taking it all in . " Wow , " he said , and he heard himself sounding very boyish . Brian was thirty-seven . " That 's very impressive , " and his voice dimbed even higher . <p> The bartender responded with a strange , appreciative smile and just enough hesitant shuffling to let Brian know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . <p> " Ahh ! " squeaked Brian , " then you  --  " He pointed at the wall . There was tension in his throat , a mechanical failure , and he could n't tell what it was from . It was very frustrating . He wished he could get his beer , already . Maybe it would help to relax his voice . His finger was still out in the air , and the bartender was smiling broadly . Then he stepped aside in a way that was both prideful and self-mocking . <p> " Uh-hmm , " he confirmed . And Brian nearly forgot his own partial question . " Jesus , " said Brian , with what he hoped was a positive-sounding reverence and a manly sounding depth . He felt as though his body were barely containing three inconvenient , conflicting animals : one mesmerized by the physical pull of the painting , one trying to express a newly adolescent vocalization , and one trying to order lunch . Cracking . Brian really wanted that beer , but the bartender was still keen on discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have put a mirror back there . A lot of places , you 'll see a mirror behind the bar . I do n't know about that , myself . Not my taste . " <p> Brian nodded . <p> " I mean , who the hell would want to watch hisself drinking a beer or chewing his food or smoking "  --  the bartender moved his rag-swathed hand in a series of small loops to indicate the small cycles of choice  --  " when he could look at her instead ? " The bartender turned his attention toward the television momentarily and missed Brian 's respectful shrug . Brian compensated with an agreeing grunt . <p> Brian ventured , perhaps too carefully , " She is an achievement . I must ask you  --  " and then he could n't find the words . Stumbling , he tried again , " Rather , I would say , the most amazing aspect seems  --  " <p> The bartender squinted at Brian and asked , " ' Scuse me ? " <p> " I 'm sorry . I was just wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . map out the particulars . " Brian realized that he was making a sort of flipping gesture with his left hand , as he spoke , snapping it around from the wrist , palm out but dose to the chest . He suspected that it appeared fey , so he dropped his hands to his lap self-consciously . <p> " I do n't think I get you . You from up north ? " <p> " Yeah . " Brian was beginning to feel embarrassed . " I guess I mean the proportions . She 's so , well , expansive . And close " <p> The bartender smiled . " Yes sir , that 's my favorite part . My boy and me drew her out in pencil first , going by a magazine picture . Took half a day to get it right " <p> " Prodigious . Quite " <p> " Then we filled her in . You a schoolteacher ? " asked the bartender , and he turned his back to Brian , then adding , possibly , but it was too mumbled to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brian was a little shocked . Quietly , he confirmed , " I used to take children 's photos at K-Mart , but on occasion I 've taught . Photography for an Adult Ed program . Back in Ohio . " <p> " So you 're a real artist , huh ? Cincinnati ? " <p> Brian wanted to ask the man if he was making fun of him , but he was intimidated by the breadth of the bartender 's sweat-stained , white shirt back and the prominence of his powerfully grinding shoulder blades . With an inaudible sigh , Brian answered , " Been there . But no . I 'm from Akron . " <p> The bartender 's back said , " Pabst ? " <p> " No . No catsup . Plain . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Hmm ? " <p> " Draft . Pabst . " <p> " Please . " <p> Brian 's face warmed uncomfortably . He looked down at his hands and noticed that they looked thinner and weaker in the diffused illumination of beer signs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the " cracking " notion was doubly true . What Madeline meant was that he was losing his mind , that she had noticed a change in him , a steady creeping toward conservatism which she had assumed was politically charged , and so she 'd refused to take it seriously , at first . But he 'd succeeded in unnerving her with his increased tendency toward stillness . <p> He 'd embraced immotility as one might embrace a new religion . It was not just a technique for control , but it was in him  --  a brewing , unbibled philosophy and just as volatile . His mood was such a fragile one , too easily disrupted . She could n't vacuum when he was home , or he 'd become agitated and suspicious , like his mother 's old dachshund . Deep colors and new sounds tended to make him anxious . So did the perfumes of their house , or the disparities of light from room to room . She would find him sometimes , in the frame of a paralyzing doorway , his jaw set against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talk , make her cry by telling her outright that her " abstractions were sinister , " and he would accuse her of pretending not to understand him . <p> In retrospect , Brian reasoned that Madeline 's " cracking " accusation was too mild , obviously tempered by her affection . She should have been more specific , more cruel to him . As it was , the combination of their intimacy and her kindness had proved unbearable . He 'd hit the road after shattering a jar of spaghetti sauce on the kitchen floor , having found himself incapable of cleaning it up . He 'd watched her on the floor , with her paper towels , dustpan , and an unwieldy broom , moving rhythmically , without tiredness , while he stood disabled on just one square foot of linoleum tile . Pleasure , terror , and impotence all inhabited the very same breath . That last image was of her rump , high in the air , and she 'd steadied herself on two knees and an elbow , not knowing that an escaped strand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he could n't tell her about it . <p> The other sense of cracking was his own private one ; the physical crack at the base of his skull , invisible deft , a schism of flesh he felt spreading at night when he lay his head into the pillow , an activity which had recently developed into a ceremony : the lowering of the head , the placing of the brain  --  the ritual of sinking encased plutonium to the bottom of the sea . Preventing him from sleep , he 'd sense splitting under the cerebellum , he 'd sense a leaking crack in the barrel . Madeline had whined for him to see a doctor . She thought he had arthritis , or some other bone-stiffening disease . <p> Brian swiveled on his stool , pretending to be bored , careful not to make uncool eye contact with any of the other patrons . The wall behind him was patchworked with neon beer signs and posters of unknown women cuddling frosty bottles between their legs and breasts . <p> They seemed so ordinary . Not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were too human , too vulnerable to abuse . Miniature glories at best . Why did n't they just wilt or mildew or disintegrate , having to face the great wall of Dolly ? <p> He was steadily losing the memory of his wife 's sad face , but with what impression of her was left , he tried to compare against the sexually worked expressions of the women from the posters . There was a difference , sure , but not one that could be so easily expressed as , " Well , she is wanting , and Madeline does not , " or " These lips seem so much softer , wetter . . . " Rather , the difference was a matter of bones and a lack of stillness and something to do with the very separate mind of the body which caused Madeline to appear to be in constant movement , in constant process . <p> That appearance , his awareness of Madeline 's process , caused his cells to crawl . He got hot flashes , spots on his scalp and cheek that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the familiar anxiety he could n't shake , inexplicably the same sense of dread he 'd suffered when he , as a boy , had watched other boys trap panicked creatures in their hands  --  mice or lizards . They seemed to do it just for the strange pleasure of observing tiny hearts beating hard under the skin of delicate bodies . As a witness , his willingness and repulsion were irreconcilable . <p> Brian began to formulate a theory of proportional relationships between the level of his excitements and his sense of potential energy in other bodies . Particularly female ones , which he subcategorized as escaping , trapped , and static . If Madeline 's unyielding vitality represented one extreme of this continuum of stimulating objects , then Dolly , in her treasured fix , constituted . . . Brian had n't noticed before that there were some slight imperfections in the surface of the painting , especially where there was a greater thickness of paint , as in the great curving swell of Dolly 's lavender hip . Small fissures , of the kind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disrupting the illusion of Dolly 's immutable nature . It was obvious an attempt had been made toward maintenance ; new paint had been applied to touch up the gaps of the old , but the fractures still left shadows for the studious to detect . Brian quelled an urge to point out that he was not the only one who was cracking . A sudden rush of warmth made his fingertips feel like they were about to burst . <p> New music came stronger from the radio . Stations were being changed by an unseen hand . Roused from his fantasy , Brian looked around , embarrassed , but no one knew what he was thinking . No eye singled him out and saw through . No eye desired to . He counted in his head , steadied himself . He pretended that there was a way to order noise and light , a way to cope with all the stimuli . <p> The food and beer came . " That 's two eighty-five , " said the bartender , " and that 's no joke . " Tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the tip . He noticed that Bond 's situation had changed for the worse . The superagent was running across alligators ' backs , and their jaws were snapping in time with his steps . Wild . It looked nice and warm there where the alligators were . Florida . Brian drained his beer and ordered another . Those conflicting animals were settling down to slumber , but slowly . Dolly 's lines were softer , more lovely , than when he had first come in to this place . She was n't so hard to look at , after all . There was an ultimate , permanent stillness in the way she lay , as fixed as a gigantic Vargas girl . <p> " Pabst , " he mouthed , out of respect for the language they spoke down here . <p> Dolly . Even her faults were in an arrested state . She was , above all things , reliable . It would be possible to return to her again and again and detect no process , no tainting movement , save the natural progress of entropy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loved one . Goddesses , unlike women , were traditionally wrought from singular materials : bronze , stone , and paint . So function knew no trouble in matching the form . Deep comfort was settling in Brian , as deep as liquor , as deep as statuary . Her mouth was non-potential , her body , completely achieved . He felt inspired to discreetly cross himself in her lavender presence and silently ask for an ungrantable forgiveness . Her lack of response was what he 'd sought , was what was given . I suspect reverie , he confessed , and was not blessed by her . <p> The bar was filling up with men who had just finished work for the day , and Brian rose against that tide of seekers as he walked toward the door . He made eye contact with a few of them , pretending he was recognizable in these parts . The day's-end smell of bodies came in from the frequently opened doorway , borne on cold , snowless air , which Brian savored . Descending the mountain at night would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the car was to falling over an edge . He glanced at the television just before he left : <p> Bond in the arms of an incredibly beautiful woman . Very warm in Florida . Jane Seymour . <p> Jane Seymour . <p> New Vrindaban . <p> Bhaktipada . <p> Some things just click . Renewed and impervious , he was n't startled by the door slamming back on its springs behind him . He was distracted by the notion of taking detours through wealthier neighborhoods to explore their fancy graveyards ; he thought he might visit some granite angels . <p> <p> By L. E.
