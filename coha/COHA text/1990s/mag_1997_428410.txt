<p> Every culture seems to have toys that reflect its way of life . miniature clay knights on horseback entertained children in medieval Europe , and child 's play during the French Revolution included little guillotines that beheaded aristocratic dolls . The Industrial Revolution spawned toy machines , trains and motorcars , and in this century the culture of television images and other mass media is reflected in the reign of the Barbie doll and superhero action figures . <p> From the global scrap heap into the hands of children : a car from Madagascar , made of misprinted sheet metal <p> But in many parts of the world another kind of toy has also become a symbol of late 20th-century life . It takes many shapes and forms , but its defining characteristic is how it is made , and what it is made from . It is the recycled toy , pieced together from things made for mass consumption and meant to be thrown away . With the imagination , ingenuity and skilled hands of the toymaker , a plastic bottle in Haiti is transformed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or a tin can in India is cut and reshaped into a miniature locomotive , with bottle tops for wheels . A remarkable collection of such toys from every part of the world is currently on view at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe , New Mexico , as part of its exhibition " Recycled , Re-Seen : Folk Art from the Global Scrap Heap . " This exhibition will run until January 4 and then will travel to four other museums in the United States over the next two years . <p> More toys that ca n't be bought off the shelf : a Chinook helicopter made by teenage boys in Haiti after the U.S. intervention <p> A visitor to this show is quickly struck by the fact that , despite all the differences of culture and language , children everywhere like to play with similar toys . The language of fun has a universal vocabulary of kites and hoops , head-bobbing pull toys and spinning noisemakers , hand-size cars and trucks , weapons and airplanes , dolls and miniature sets of kitchen utensils and furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and logos that turn up in the scraps of metal and plastic recycled in these toys , as if Coca-Cola and Nestle and Mobil and Gillette have become icons that know no boundaries of culture or geography . <p> From the global scrap heap into the hands of children : miniature furniture fashioned from flattened bottle caps in Mexico <p> Writing in the richly illustrated exhibition catalog , folklorist and co-organizer Suzanne Seriff observes that these recycled toys are the artifacts of an increasingly global village : " The process of retrieving and transforming a consumer package or product that someone else has thrown away is a phenomenon that is taking place in the largest metropolises of urban America as well as the remotest corners of the Amazonian rain forest . " <p> More toys that ca n't be bought off the shelf : a petroleum truck from Liberia <p> Seriff collaborated with the museum 's director , Charlene Cerny , in developing this show . The museum began the process , which took five years , by bringing together academics from all over the world . Then , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mexico and other countries to comb through markets and workshops . In all , nearly 50 countries are represented in the show . " When we began , " Cerny recalls , " there were practically no books to rely on . All we had to start with were two Smithsonian magazine articles on recycling " <p> ( January 1980 and August 1983 ) . But the show that resulted reveals a whole world of artisans who are busy transforming trash into everything from briefcases to toys , and redefining our view of folk art along the way . <p> Walking through the show with Seriff , I can see that it is the toys that are closest to her heart . We stop to look at a simple little airplane made by a Senegalese boy from a plastic bleach bottle with a worn-out sandal sole stuck through the handle to make the wings , and with wheels cut from the same material . " I think this is my favorite , " Seriff says . " It uses so little , and it says so much . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered toys , miniature cars , motorcycles and fancy touring bicycles . Constructed out of wire coat hangers and telephone wire , bits of metal cans and bicycle chains , they are remarkably similar in ingenuity and elegance . In another display , a toy Deux Chevaux car , made out of scrap metal from cans of Nestle Lait Concentre ( condensed milk ) , with a peeled-back sunroof , seems to have all the flimsy charm of the classic Citroen . The toy , however , was not made in France but in Madagascar . <p> Seeing these toys in a folk art museum , formally displayed and labeled , so far from the scrap heap that spawned them , seems a little ironic  --  we usually see folk art as something pure ; authentic , if not primitive . But that is part of the fun of this show , as in the case of a toy truck whose label documents what it is made of : " Gillette Right Guard deodorant , Famosa tomato paste cans , Famosa pear juice cans , plastic shoe soles . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the little cars and horses from South Africa and Senegal , made from recycled bug bombs and pesticide cans , with bright logos and poison warnings incorporated into the toys ' design . Seriff says that many scholars in her field are challenging the classic view of folk art as nonindustrial , premodern and rural . " These toys are a great example of folk art that is a grafting of different technologies , sensibilities and values , " she says . " The old view sees folk art as disappearing under the impact of modern globalized culture , but this kind of recycling is by definition an impure , hybrid art form and you can see how it 's thriving . " There are other ironies hidden in these toys , Seriff points out . " Many of these fancy toy bikes and cars and motorcycles are inspired by products of a consumer society that is way beyond reach for the children who play with them , or make them , " she says . " On the other hand , some of these war toys , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too real in their daily lives . " Indeed , one display in the show highlights a collection of shiny war toys , including Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters and a Humvee rough-terrain vehicle , made by a group of teenage boys only a few weeks after the U.S. intervention in Haiti in 1994 . They used plastic bottles , cans , scrap metal , ballpoint pens , film canisters and tiny plastic toy soldiers . <p> Some of the toys in the show have a more traditional , domestic character , although they 're made from recycled materials . For example , tiny kitchen utensils , plates , pots , braziers , buckets and dustpans , made from snippets of discarded cans and plastic , are popular items with little girls in Mexico . These toys , which fit in the palm of a child 's hand and sell for a few cents apiece , are commonly made and sold in a corner of the same markets where women buy real kitchenware and appliances . Miniature sets of tables and chairs are made from discarded bottle caps that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The appeal of all these toys is that they show the imagination and skill of the toymakers . This is the esthetic of recycling  --  incorporating brand names and raw materials into the finished product without the veneer of manufactured toys . " In the United States , packaging is what is sold , " says Seriff . " We expect toys to be boxed , and new . We look for novelty . The label is important . It 's got to be Nike ; a knockoff wo n't do . It 's the esthetic of scarcity . These recycled toys are the opposite in every respect . " <p> But even that aspect of this folk art may be changing , too . " In India , " says Seriff , " one of our curators found factories where people make toys by hand from recycled tin cans and other scrap . Then the toys are packaged in commercial boxes with labels and sold as if the toys are manufactured !
