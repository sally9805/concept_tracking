 | his paws , his eyes ? one blue , the other brown ? glancing upward , while Poverella stretched her head into Amy 's lap to be scratched . " How 'd they get their names ? " she asked , nodding toward Poverella while scratching behind the dog 's ears . " They 're both named after saints , " Brother S told her . " Dom is named after St. Dominic , of course . " He told her how St. Domi-nic 's mother , while pregnant , had a prophetic dream of a dog with a flaming torch in his mouth . She foresaw that her son Dominic would found an order called Dominicans , or ? in a Latin pun ? Domini canes , watchdogs of the Lord . St. Ed had thought Dom 's coat looked a little like the Dominicans ' black-and-white habit . Dom 's littermate , Poverella , was named after St. Margaret of Cortona , Brother S explained . The Tuscans referred to the saint as La Poverella , or " poor little woman , " after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful woman who previously had been the mistress of a violent Italian lord and had even borne him a son . She remained his mistress for nine years until one day a dog pulled at her skirts and led her to a bush , where she found her lover murdered . She was shocked into repentance and became a Franciscan . " There 's a famous painting of her with a dog that looks a little like Poverella here , " Brother S said . " Do you believe those stories ? " " They 're not so odd . God works in a lot stranger ways . Legend has it that one day when St. Margaret was kneeling in front of the crucifix ? she 'd become almost a hermit late in life ? Christ leaned down from the cross toward her to indicate that her sin of loving too much was forgiven . " " So she had it both ways . She was a sinner and a saint .

Monks turn away from the ways of the world . "  | " It seems so puritanical , so unnecessarily hard . " " Nothing worth having is easy . That 's why St. Ed is always saying I demand nothing short of perfection . ' " " Who could say something as unnatural as celibacy is perfec-tion ?

" Is the hard work that great thinkers endure natural ? All greatness comes out of bucking the way of least resistance , which is human nature to follow . It 's a matter of energy overcoming entropy . That 's why St. Ed likes boxing ; he says the deprivation of boxers is like that of monks . Resistance breeds intensity , and St. Ed says there 's no love so intense , so all-consuming , as celibate love . He should know . " " He 's certainly got you convinced , " Amy said . " But I think it 's just another way of fearing love . " The next morning after vigils during the normal time of daily chapter , Brother S asked Amy about her eye . The skin from the corner of her eye to her temple had turned a greenish black . " My boyfriend , " she said . " Or the guy who used to be my boyfriend . I wondered whether you were ever going to notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was my business to intrude . I have n't seen you particularly shy about saying what you want . " Amy told him that things came to a head with her boyfriend after she 'd returned from the hermitage . " That accident put things in focus for me , " she said , " I almost died . I would 've died if you had n't spotted me . I started seeing things differently when I got home . " One thing she saw was that her relationship with Jerry , her boyfriend , had been bad for months but she just would n't admit it . " He was getting heavier and heavier into drugs , but I would n't let myself see it . He even smelled different . Then when I got back I learned he 's been doing up his own drugs and dealing . " He had also taken up with another girl he 'd met on the test site . Brother S could n't understand how she had gotten mixed up with such a person . She seemed so healthy . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little by little , so you ca n't  | see what 's happening . I actually met Jerry at a 10K run in Death Valley . We both worked out at the same health club in Tonopah . We liked a lot of the same things ; we liked to go dancing . He lived in Oklahoma City for a while and does a great two-step . We 'd go out to Sam 's Town or Rockabilly , and the people would really look at us . He liked to camp with me , at least in the beginning . He read a lot , too , all of Edward Abbey , John Nichols , Hunter Thompson . " " But the drugs , " Brother S protested . " I knew he did a little powder ? cocaine , you know ? but who does n't ? I just did n't know things were getting so bad . " " I thought they did drug tests on workers out at the test site . " " No , " she said , " they go through the motions once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand workers out there , and if they did anything rigorous they would n't have anybody working for them . That 's where Jerry makes most of his deals . " " If he has another girlfriend , why 'd he hit you ? " " She 's not his girlfriend . She was just someone who was there . I was suspicious , of course , but I guess I really did n't want to know till now . All the evidence was right in front of me , but I just would n't see it until after getting back I put two and two together and figured it out . She was one of the test site workers featured in Playboy or Penthouse ? I forget which ? when they did a spread on Girls of the Nuclear Test Site . ' A lot of the girls in the feature did n't really work at the test site , but she did . She was one of the Nukey Babes ? that 's what they called them ? posed in front of a mushroom cloud .

So I 'd been staring at her all the time . It was funny , I did n't feel jealous at all , just sad , I guess . I know she really does n't mean anything to him , but I just could n't put up with it anymore . I 'd told him about you and St. Ed and your life out here and how our life together did n't make sense anymore . That 's when he went berserk and hit me . The sad part is that it 's not really him ; it 's the crank , the speed he 's on that made him this way . Deep down Jerry 's a loving person ? that 's why it 's so hard to leave him ? but drugs have got the best of him , and he 's not himself anymore . " Later that morning Brother S tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the solar wall he was building for the new guest cell . He kept thinking of Amy , her boyfriend 's fist slamming the side of her head . Despite the deep sadness in her voice as she told him the story , she 'd remained dry-eyed . She was n't sure what she was going to do now , she told him ; she 'd always wanted to be a marine biologist , to go to Scripps Oceanographic Institution . She 'd spent time at the ocean when she used to visit L.A. ? the home of her aunt who 'd once played Rita Hayworth 's Spanish maid in Blood and Sand ? but it was too late for her to switch fields now . When she went to the University of Nevada it had made sense for her to study Great Basin wildlife . That 's how she 'd gotten the seasonal job as assistant to the BLM wildlife biologist in Tonopah . She still had to finish her thesis study of bighorns in the Great Basin , but she wondered whether she 'd ever get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common , at least until recently ; they both felt uncomfortable around academics , and they both liked doing things ? running , working out , dancing , camping , hiking . Jerry could 've been a lawyer , she said , but he 'd dropped out of school to work with machines . The contractor he worked for on the test site ? REECO ? valued him for his skill with mud pumps and drilling rigs . Yet at the same time she was never happier than when she was alone on the desert . In Reno she 'd spend weekends by herself on the Black Rock Desert , doing nothing , she said , just drifting with the sands . What she 'd been coming to realize in recent months was that all her activity with Jerry really meant less to her than her solitude . " That 's the whole point of solitude , " Brother S said , " to get rid of our false selves . " " I can understand that , " she said . What now made most sense , she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she wanted to stay close by while her mother underwent cancer treatment . So she did n't know what she was going to do . She liked the chance to stay at the hermitage and think for a while . When she 'd left after her accident , she 'd kept thinking of the hermitage ; she 'd felt a powerful force drawing her back . " I think I could do it , " she said . " What do you mean ? " " Be a monk . I think I could do the job . "  | " Being a monk is more than a job . It 's a way of life . " " That 's what I want . Another way of life . " Brother S had his shoulder braced against a i x 12 as he tried to nail it into the movable wall . Bent over , his shoulder aching with the weight of the board , his arm swinging the hammer at an awkward angle , he blinked to clear his eyes of stinging sweat . The sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She told him to hold the board as she took the hammer from him and drove the nail home . For the rest of the afternoon they worked together , saying little except about the construction of the cell . It was clear to him that Amy had worked with hammers before . She even knew how to use a saw . When he told her to sand the movable wall , she folded a piece of sandpaper around a small block of scrapwood to make herself a tool for sanding . He liked the careful way she worked . He thought of her boyfriend on the test site , just over the hills to the south of them . The amount of surplus machinery there was enormous , Amy had said . There were wasted stockpiles of gigantic pumps , drills , and pipes . Surplus holes pocked the test site like wounds . Brother S 's reverie was broken when Amy asked , " How 's this ? " She had been patiently sanding a portion of the movable wall 's surface as he 'd instructed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine sandpaper . " I 've been doing this part for about twenty minutes , " she said . Brother S lightly rubbed his fingertips over the smooth surface of the wood where she had sanded . He looked at the powdery dust of wood nestled like yellow pollen in the ridges and whorls of his fingertips . " You better do it just a little more , " he said . " It should be perfect . It 's for the Lord , you know . "  | Shoshone Mountain To what purpose is this waste ? ? Matthew 26:8 In the Department of Energy office , St. Ed watched the monitor as Joan Yerkes , the DOE spokeswoman he 'd seen on TV , slipped a videocassette into the VCR . The dead eye of the monitor screen flickered . A cratered moonscape came into view . Across barren Yucca Flat the camera moved toward a derrick holding a nuclear bomb on a steel rod poised above a hole ten feet in diameter and a mile deep . Slowly the device , as it was called , descended into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miles of cables attached to monitoring equipment fanned up out of the hole . Packed tightly into place , covered to the hilt , the device came alive with energy , exploding deep in the bowels of the earth , vaporizing millions of dollars ' worth of equipment , pounding with more than a hundred thousand tons of force against the dark walls of its containment , sending up shock waves of energy until the earth at its hard surface rippled like water and then collapsed into a crater . A dusty cloud roiled into the sky . Cordoned off , a wasteland remained , pitted , poisoned , and unusable , deadly to anyone daring to penetrate into the aftermath of the underground explosion . " That 's Mighty Oak , " Joan Yerkes said , giving St. Ed the code name of the nuclear test . " That 's the last venting we 've had from an underground test . " He remembered Mighty Oak well . The day hefoore the test , EPA  | officers had come to the hermitage in their white van to announce what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " weather per-mitting , " which always meant there would be a nuclear test if the wind was blowing north , away from Las Vegas and in the direction of the hermitage . The following day the EPA men were back checking their monitors . " They 've had a little accident , " they announced . " It vented . " No problem , the DOE subsequently assured residents . No measurably harmful amount of radiation had escaped the test site . " I have a nice blow-up of Mighty Oak in the other room , " Ms. Yerkes said . " I 'll give you a copy . " Before St. Ed could object , she guided him out the door . In her exuberance she reminded him of one of those TV Mouseketeer girls from his youth , but without the mouse ears . A pretty blond woman with a Midwestern accent , she seemingly had jumped out of a TV screen , bubbly with energy in a starched blouse , pressed navy skirt , and short matching jacket tucked at her waist . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered . With his red visitor 's badge pinned to his scapular ? he 'd worn his habit for the sake of effect ? he preceded her past an armed Wackenhut security guard and into another office . Ms. Yerkes called into the hall , " Roseanne , I have a red badge in here . Will you watch him for a moment ? " Then she was gone , her black pumps clacking the floor , her hips pumping under the tight skirt like pistons as she motored through the doorway and out of sight . He remembered Nathan Spock 's secretary and prayed to be spared from temptation . While another young woman with dark hair and a friendly smile eyed him from the doorway , he glanced down at the overflowing in-box on Joan Yerkes 's desk , the typical overload of the subordinate bureaucrat , the pile of papers topped with a memo about the difference between " repository " and " dump , " followed by a list of definitions from Webster 's Third and suggestions for getting people to use the right word in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ms. Yerkes said as she whooshed back through the doorway , her blouse undulating while the shadowy forms of her'breasts brushed beneath the starched cloth . Such energy , he thought , she quivered with it . She plopped down a pile of8 x to color photos , covering her desk . " Here 're pictures oft he  | inner scheme of the Climax Waste Repository on the test site , and the Hot Disassembly Bay at E-MAD , too , " she said . " And here are some drawings of Shoshone Mountain with cutaway views of the repository . All these pictures used to be classified , but now we even give them away at town meetings . We figure the walls of the Kremlin are already covered with them anyway . " St. Ed looked at a photograph of three little kit foxes peering through piles of tubing on the Nuclear Test Site , happily showing how the natural environment and nuclear testing could survive together . " I came here from the EPA , " Ms. Yerkes said , " and so it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmentalist . " " I really do n't need this stuff , " St. Ed said . He knew what the bottom line of it all was : everything 's safe , or at least worth the risk . Then his eye caught the picture of a tornado-shaped cloud rising from the desert : Mighty Oak . " We 're rather proud of Mighty Oak , " Ms. Yerkes said , ignoring his dismissal of the photos . " That little accident allowed us to develop safeguards to prevent it from ever happening again . Oh , oh . " She looked at the digital runner 's watch on her wrist . " It 's almost three-thirty . I have to drive you over to see Gilbert . " Ms. Yerkes peeled the gray DOE sedan out of the parking lot , down Maryland Parkway , to the converted Las Vegas garage where Gilbert Davis supervised the Shoshone Mountain Project . As they hurried side by side down the rug-lined hallway past the doorways of the Science Application International Corporation to Davis 's office , a stabbing pain returned to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night with a throbbing in his lower chest . He felt that submerged sense of tiredness he 'd experienced after the Nathan Spock show , as if mired in sand or moving underwater in a dream . He 'd almost canceled his meeting with Director Davis . The bishop had made the appointment to help get him to cooperate with the DOE . He 'd wanted the meeting in order to try to get them off his back . But it seemed futile . With the motel phone in his hand that morning he 'd dialed the number of the DOE but was disconnected when the operator had attempted to transfer the call to the director 's secretary . He did n't have the energy to redial . He had to go through with it . He needed to know his enemy . He had to protect the hermitage .  | From enormous fluorescent squares on the ceiling of the direc-tor 's office , light streamed down across a clean , polished desk . Closed venetian blinds blocked the windows on the far wall . Surprised to see no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis himself appeared by his side , smiling warmly , his hand extended , wearing grey slacks , a crisp white shirt , a neatly knotted navy tie , and a dark blue blazer with some sort of coat-of-arms insignia on the pocket . He was the first man St. Ed had seen that morning at the DOE wearing a jacket ; everyone else ? including Ms. Yerkes 's boss and the deputy director of the test site ? dressed in casual clothes like polo shirts and khaki pants , as though at a barbecue . With his high forehead , thinning hair , and silver-rimmed glasses , Gil Davis eerily reminded St. Ed of the bishop when he 'd first met him fifteen years earlier ; then he remembered that Davis was indeed a clergyman , an ordained Episcopal priest with degrees in civil engineering and systems management . Ms. Yerkes had said that after ten years in the navy , where he 'd worked with the Atomic Energy Commission 's Division of Naval Reactors , Davis had joined the Russell Engineering and Electric Company and moved to Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste management team , supervising the Shoshone Mountain Project and evaluating other potential high-level nuclear waste sites . A lifelong Episcopalian , he was nominated for the priesthood by the congregation at All Saints Episcopal Church in accord with a canon allowing elevation of parishioners to the rank of priest in remote parishes . He was ordained five years ago . Who better than a clergyman , St. Ed thought , to deal with what might be satanic waste ? " I 'm so glad to meet you , Father Ed , " Gil exclaimed as he squeezed the monk 's hand . " The bishop has spoken of you often . And of course I saw you on the Nathan Spock show . " He pushed his face closer . " I happen to think Spock is a horse 's ass , but you handled him very well , especially when he tried to radicalize your views about nuclear issues . Those TV people trivialize everything . " When Gil 's face loomed up , light glinted off his forehead and silvery glasses , reminiscent of reflections offa new Buick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt himself being  | knocked over some hallucinatory wall . Gil 's intense , eager eyes and continuous half-smile exerted a pressure on him , almost physically palpable , that sent his emotions churning . He had a feeling he was being pushed along with the bishop and Gil himself onto some modern ecumenical fast track he did n't want to share . Gil Davis and the bishop were pals ; they flew together to conferences on the same planes , appeared on panels and TV debates together , attended the same luncheons , talked the same language . " Have a seat , Father Ed . " Gil motioned toward a plush , nubbly couch , wide as a pew , to the right of the door , situated behind a coffee table covered with colorful pamphlets , brochures , onepage handouts , and packaged folders about nuclear waste and its transportation , storage , and characteristics . " Please take any of these you want , Father . " " Ms. Yerkes has given me more than I want . " " Did she give you the full Site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Ms. Yerkes for help . " I offered him the summary , " she said , crossing her legs and flipping open a spiral notebook . " Give him the report , " Gil Davis said , spreading his arms to indicate its fullness . As he spoke , a procession of men and women entered the room and took seats on each side of the director , who still held his arms widespread . " It 's the full eighteen-volume , **32;0;TOOLONG document you 'll be getting , Father . " Gil seemed gleeful . Ms. Yerkes 's soft-tipped pen silently marked a reminder into her notebook . " I really do n't think I need it , " St. Ed said . " For reference , " Gil rejoined . " Whenever you need to know something , you 'll have it . Of course , you can call us at any time as well . If there 's anything we can do for you just let us know . " The director 's subordinates had no sooner taken their positions to the sides of him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as contractors and scientists involved in the Shoshone Mountain Project : Sally Bridge , SAIC senior staff geologist ; John Farrell , DOE and USGS geochemist and hydrologist ; Tim Martinelli , supervisor of the Moroni Construction Company ; Peggy Little , SAIC assistant director and Sho-  | shone project liaison ; Bob Brooks , chief engineer for Russell Engineering and Electric Company ; and Max Frishenheimer , a dark , glowering man who was an SAIC staff geologist . " Now what can we do for you , Father ? " St. Ed realized he was n't prepared for this situation . He 'd expected to meet the director alone , one on one , not a slew of scientific high priests and bureaucratic curia . He recalled the sensation he 'd experienced in front of his board of examiners before his ordination . He 'd been prepared that morning to argue about recent developments in Christology . Despite various disagreements , he and his inquisitors shared a theological basis for disagreement . Today , he realized , he was facing an inquisition committed to something else : his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , aware that a good offense was the best defense , " is how you plan to get me out of my hermitage if I do n't intend to go . " Gil Davis looked genuinely shocked ; his lips snapped shut . Until this moment , Gil 's jaw , hanging eagerly open in a continuous halfsmile , reminded St. Ed of Dom and Poverella as puppies , exposing their tongues in pink smiles , eager to please , desirous of affection . " I do n't understand what you mean , Father Ed . " " The bishop said the DOE intends to appropriate the land we 're on . I assume you know how you intend to take it . " Gil Davis looked to the people first on his right , then to his left , before sadly shaking his head . " We 're not the people to ask about land appropriation , " he said . " Our job is evaluation , implementation , and supervision of waste management projects . " His subordinates nodded in agreement . " Perhaps Joan can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her left leg and crossed her right , tugging at the hem of her skirt under her knee . St. Ed felt something thrilling in the sound of her stockings rubbing together in a hushed room full of men . " He will have to talk to the BLM , " she told the director . " We apply to the BLM only for withdrawal of land already in the public domain . We have no dealings with private individuals . " " Well , then , maybe you can tell me how you got land in the past , " St. Ed asked . " How did you get the land around Shoshone  | Mountain and the Nuclear Test Site ? Private individuals lived on it . " Director Davis again shook his head . " That is not our field , " he said . " I can help you there , " Ms. Yerkes said . " When we get back to my office , I can give you the list of public land orders . The president withdrew all lands from the public domain by executive order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cattle and mines on them ? " " You 're talking about something that goes way back , " Ms. Yerkes said . " You 'd have to talk to the BLM and the air force about the original withdrawals forty or fifty years ago . " " But the people ? " he pursued . " Way back then , there were very few people , " Ms. Yerkes said . " There was no private land out there . Maybe a few mines were leased , but those leases were bought out . You 'd have to check with the air force and BLM about that history . It goes back forty or fifty years . " Director Davis nodded in agreement . St. Ed knew that the state 's small population was the reason the Nuclear Test Site was in Nevada and the waste dump was going into Shoshone Mountain . That was the bottom line . There just were n't enough people to fight back . That 's why they could ride roughshod over a hermitage with only two monks in it . " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty hard to say the Shoshone have no claims to a place called Shoshone Moun-tain . " Director Davis 's face assumed a sorrowful expression . " You have n't heard today 's news , " he said , lifting his voice into a questioning tone , " about the Shoshone ? " He used the two-syllable Anglicized pronunciation SHOW-shown , instead of the threesyllable Sho-sHo-ne . " Today the Supreme Court ruled for the third time against the Shoshone 's appeal . " Gil Davis reverently bowed his head . " With all due respect to the Shoshone concerns , the DOE must emphatically agree with the highest court in the land that the Indians ' title to Shoshone Mountain and the test site is absolutely extinguished . The land belongs to the DOE . " St. NI recalled June Mosho 's resolve to persevere in her fight  | against the government . " But the Shoshone do n't agree with that . " " No , they do n't . " Gil Davis looked down at his hands , as cleanly manicured as the bishop 's , and frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " the Shoshone are apparently oblivious to the setbacks they 've had in the courts . They and their socalled allies will just keep seeking publicity . " He lifted his head . " But their protests will have no effect on our progress . " St. Ed wondered if he might borrow some of the Shoshone 's strategy to protect the hermitage . " So the Indians were the glitch that was holding you up till now ? " " Oh , no , " Gil Davis said happily . He was buoyant and energetic once again . St. Ed noticed the people sitting next to him perk up . " We just need final clearance for the canisters to be stored in Shoshone Mountain . " " They 've found a few cracks in the repository , " the REECO engineer added , " and so they 're temporarily holding things up . " " But we anticipated those cracks , " Gil said ; " they 're in our study . There 's also a little water we did n't anticipate , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fuss the media has made . " St. Ed wished Brother S were with him to deal with these scientists . They assured him that the dry volcanic tuff of Shoshone Mountain would prevent radionuclides from entering the groundwater hundreds of feet below the repository , and that rainfall in the region or changes in the water table would not affect the repository . " None of this is new , " Gil Davis said . " We did n't start thinking about these things yesterday . At least seven years of studies went into our Site Characterization Plan , followed by a year of technical review . Seven more years went into the Environmental Impact Statement before we developed our seven-year construction plan and three-year assessment report . " " Even this problem of earthquakes that everyone is talking about was anticipated in the EIS , " Sally Bridge said . " Whenever there 's an earthquake , the damage is always above ground , " Gil Davis explained . " You could compare the repository to a grape in a bowl of jello . If you wiggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the grape remains stable . " Gil held out his hands as though shaking a bowl of jello . " That 's how the repository would  | remain during an earthquake . Stable . " Gil went on to describe a famous earthquake in China which killed hundreds of thousands of people , but left unharmed ten thousand workers in the mines underground . " The repository is the safest place to be in an earthquake . Not much chance of any ' nukey bugs ' escaping , " he added weakly . A hurt expression had come into Gil 's eyes in recognition of St. Ed 's lack ofresponse to his analogy about the earthquake in China . St. Ed felt an unaccountable twinge of guilt for hurting the man 's feelings . It was as if there were such enthusiasm in the room , such optimism and hope , that any skepticism was an affront . Here was a team of technicians who believed in making things work , and if you questioned their plans , then you somehow questioned them , their deepest beliefs , their sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another meeting , " Gil said , looking at his watch as he stood up , " but you 're welcome to talk with whoever can stay . " The dark-browed geologist with a shock of disheveled hair , Max Frishenheimer , who had sat slouched in his chair with arms folded and so far had said nothing , lifted his head and told St. Ed , " We really know very little about the earth and how it 's evolv-ing . " He spoke with a thick accent , and St. Ed remembered that it was Frishenheimer who had filed a minority report on what he termed the thermodynamics of Shoshone Mountain . After brief attention in the media , the report was forgotten , buried beneath mounds of contradictory scientific opinion . While some scientists found Max 's premises objectionable , the media found his thick accent , his meditative ramblings , and his sinister Strangelovian looks inappropriate for TV . He 'd disappeared from the news but had remained safely ensconced and accepted as the DOE 's institutional heretic . Max Frishenheimer spoke in convoluted sentences about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plate tectonics in the Great Basin , the folly of fragmented scientific studies , the holistic way in which the mountain must be viewed as an interrelated complex of energies , the tremendous pressure exerted along the fractured fault lines , the future movement of the volcanic mountain as part ofa larger process of geologic evohit ion . As he spoke , Ms. Yerkes seemed to he smiling condescend-  | ingly , and Gil returned to his chair , sitting on its edge to indicate that he 'd returned for only a moment . Sally Bridge interrupted Max to say , " You must remember , Father , the time span Max is ... " " If you will puleeze allow me to finish , " Max said , glowering at Sally as he pulled a pack of Marlboros out of his pocket and fingered an unlit cigarette . " My opinion about Shoshone Mountain , " he concluded , " is that it 's in the nature of that beast to go wacko . " Gil smiled broadly at St. Ed . " Now you must remember , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of traditional science is otherwise . " " It all depends on your initial viewpoint , " Max added , " your beginning scientific assumptions . " " So what we really have here , " St. Ed said , " is a conflict of faiths . " Max Frishenheimer smiled and winked at him . " That 's exactly right , " Gil said . " It 's a problem of faith . We have to have faith in the consensus of science . In the past forty-five hundred years since the Egyptians built their pyramids , we 've advanced incredibly in what we can do . Our problem is n't scientific or technical . The problem is getting the public to give up fearful speculations and to have faith in scientific conclusions . The whole problem is that the public fears what it does n't understand . " " What I was trying to say earlier , " Sally Bridge said , " is that Max is talking about thousands of years from now . " " In the meantime , Mother Earth will do her job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay . " " By then , " Gil added , " we 'll have developed casks impermeable to any water . We 'll then be able to retrieve this stuff and dump it anywhere , right in the ocean , if we want . " St. Ed felt overwhelmed . " But this is all in the future , " he objected . " You 're putting all this burden on your children . " " Hey , " Gil Davis assured him , " my kids are going to be problem solvers , not whiners . " The next morning St. Ed had a headache and a more intense pain in his chest when he met Gil Davis and drove from Las Vegas to the test site . The driver stopped the 4 X 4 DOE cruiser at the cattle gate where a ragtag army of protesters lined the road . Some-  | one had splattered rust-colored paint across the large metal historical marker at the entrance . The mock blood dripped through the words on the plaque announcing that the Nuclear Test Site was a place of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land 9,500 years ago . The hot wind picked up . Ahead , the country looked empty , unlivable . On the test site St. Ed found himself wearing a yellow hard hat and rattling down a fourteen-hundred-foot shaft in an open-cage elevator . Clipped to his chest was a radiation sensor with what looked like a spot of dried mustard on it . If the spot turned color , he 'd know that he 'd been zapped . Underground he stood with Gil Davis in a granite vault . Eleven cement circles in the floor indicated where nuclear rods from power plants were stored . The dank cave felt airless . His chest tightened with pain . " Here 's a model vault , " Gil said . " I ca n't take you inside Shoshone Mountain , but you can get the idea here . " " But you only have eleven rods here . " " Not even that . We had to pull the rods because of that mois-ture . " Gil pointed to the slick side of the vault darkened with water . " These holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here . " At noon the cruiser roared across a white , flat playa pocked with craters toward a ramshackle scattering of quonset huts , sheetmetal sheds , and cinder-block buildings . St. Ed followed Gil into a cafeteria . A sign warned : MICROWAVE IN USE . Ms. Yerkes joined the men for sandwiches and then climbed into the cruiser with them . Wind whipped dust across the flats . Behind volcanic cinder cones loomed a barren , flat-topped , bluish ridge . " There it is , " Gil announced above the roar of the truck . " That 's my project . " The truck approached Shoshone Mountain . A chain-link fence , towers , and armed Wackenhut security guards came into view . " We 've got crack commandos guarding this facility against ter-rorists , " Gil said . " Anybody who comes here without clearance is dead . " The truck turned and skirted along the base ofShoshone Mountain , heading hack toward Mercury , the DOE complex at the test site ent rance . It was alter three o'clock when guards checked the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | hard hat . The truck rumbled over the cattle guard of the exit gate . Across the road a colorful mass of pup tents and campers among creosote bushes marked the Peace Camp , where protesters had lived off and on for several years . " What a mess , " Gil snarled , as the truck sped past the camp . St. Ed was fed up with Gil 's disregard of anyone who did n't abide by what he considered to be the American Way . " They have a right to be here . " " Not anymore , " Ms. Yerkes said matter-of-factly . " They 've got eviction notices . Today the land reverts to the DOE . " Ms. Yerkes 's blase attitude irritated him more than what she said . Gil spoke gently . " The same is true of your hermitage , Father . After August fifteenth , it will be DOE land . " St. Ed heard his voice rise . " Not as long as I 'm on it , it wo n't be . " Gil remained conciliatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's for the national good . " " I ca n't . My purpose is for a greater good . " A sternness returned to Gil 's expression . " Then the BLM will have to drag you off . Just like those kooks . " The hot wind had picked up in Las Vegas when Ms. Yerkes drove him from Gil 's office back to his truck at DOE headquarters , her hemline riding above her knees as she alternately pumped the brake and accelerator in the rush-hour traffic . He found the sheen of summer sun on her nylon-encased legs heartwarming , a comforting presence to banish cold , abstract thoughts about terrifying radiation . Enclosed in the air-conditioned car , he returned to the cozy world he 'd known with his wife on snowy winter nights in Cambridge when they 'd sat huddled together in the front seat , before they 'd married , protected in the stormy darkness , planning a future . Safe was how he 'd felt in those moments , warmed by a woman 's voice and a shared vision . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yerkes said as they drove across town . " I gave up eating meat long ago , for philosophical reasons , not health reasons . " Another picket line of protesters greeted them when they reached the white cinder-block DOE complex . Behind a cyclone fence across the street at Kramer 's Industrial Construction Products Company , rows of skeletal metal ladders stood wrapped in shreds of dirty plastic , torn and flapping in the wind . Swaying  | Lombardy poplars spiraled heavenward . Some of the protesters made V signs with their fingers as the car passed . " It hurts me to see these protesters so abusive to Gil at open meetings , " Ms. Yerkes said , adding that one of the so-called leaders of the Peace Camp the previous week had been so drunk , or stoned , he could hardly stand up . He kept shouting at Gil , saying he was a liar and would n't give out DOE information . " That hurt me , " Ms. Yerkes said , " because for months I had been the one busting my buns sending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung into the DOE lot , a man raised a sign with block letters , NUKE WASTE IS THE DEVIL 'S SHIT . Ms. Yerkes wrinkled her pretty nose . She said the worst part of her job was responding to such frivolous protests and claims . " They 're of such limited intellectual and scientific substance , " she said with a sigh . She could understand protesters ' fears , she said , but they were unrealistic . The waste existed . That was a fact . It had to be dealt with . Thousands of tons of it . Over a hundred thousand nuclear rods throughout the country with nowhere to go . " If protesters object to burying them in Shoshone Mountain , then why do n't they come up with a better solution ? People like Gil Davis are dedicating their lives to making the world a better place for everyone , including these protesters . " " You 're naive , Joan . " He was sorry to be getting testy with her . He did n't want to lose his temper again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what my father says , but I do n't think I am . No one said the job was going to be easy , or without some risks , but I know Gil would n't allow an unsafe repository so close to Las Vegas . " " Have n't we heard all this before ? " St. Ed asked . " Atomic tests were supposed to be safe too . Now the soldiers who were out there are dying of cancer . " " What happened back then is terrible , " Ms. Yerkes agreed , " but there 's nothing sinister about it . They honestly did n't understand radiation back then . Things are different now . Gil lives in this town with his wife and three children . That 's more than you can say for most of the protesters . I do n't believe anyone who lives in this town could let an unsafe repository threaten his own family , do you ? " " Yes , " St. Ed said , " I do . "  | " Well , I do n't . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nuclear fusion . I think in the future we 're soon going to have all the energy we need without any of the waste . But we have to get through this transition period . And we have evidence that we will . " " I 'd call it faith , " he said .  | The Temptation of Brother S Here below we are not exempt from temptations . We sail on in darkness . ? Mother Syncletia , Sayings of the Desert Fathers , ca . A.D. 390 . After lunch during the time of rest and meditation , Brother S was returning from Sun Cave when he started to cut through a stand of juniper with the dogs . He stopped abruptly . On a fallen cottonwood log Amy lay stretched out in the sun naked , her bright body coated with oil , her eyes covered with two round white pads of cotton , one leg bent at the knee , the other stretched out flat on the log . Sunlight glistened on her breasts and stomach . She shifted her weight slightly as one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . The hand then passed over her stomach to stop below her waist where the tips of her fingers , disappearing into the edge of luxuriant hair darkening the fork of her legs , scratched momentarily , and then returned to rest by her side . Brother S watched Amy 's shiny body diminish from view as he backed out ofthe grove . She continued to lie motionless , her eyes covered , giving no indication that she 'd heard him . He returned to the hermitage , his heart thumping . He dropped  | to the ground in the shade of a cottonwood . It was as though he 'd come across a third woman , different from the helpless girl stranded on the desert and the one in cowboy boots and denims who 'd arrived to become his working partner at the hermitage . He was now aware of her in a different way when she came to work an hour later in her baggy sweats and carpenter 's apron . He was nervously sweating as she repeatedly passed near him while they completed the movable solar wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body moving under her gray sweatsuit . Without St. Ed to guide him , he 'd let himself slowly slide into a dangerous situation . She had to leave . Not that Amy had done anything wrong , or that he 'd felt any lust for her when he 'd seen her stretched out in the sunlight . He had n't . She 'd looked perfectly natural , perfectly healthy . He knew the body was a holy thing , as St. Ed insisted , but he 'd let himself approach what he promised in his daily act of contrition to avoid : the near occasion of sin . What reason could he now give for asking her to leave ? He 'd let so many days go by , she 'd demand an explanation if he made such a request out of the blue . Together they had fallen into a natural rhythm of daily work , prayer , and solitude . His impulse was just to be honest , to tell what had happened and how he felt , but he feared she would then think he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to lie in the sun every noon . He kept thinking of the elders in the book of Daniel who spied on Susanna while she bathed . It was clear from the story that Susanna 's nakedness was innocent and beautiful ; it was the old goats with their dried up loins who were put in a bad light . But he now felt some sympathy for the elders : they 'd initially come across Susanna accidentally . Their flaw was in their natural desire to return to spy on her as she bathed . If he did n't act immediately , perhaps he , too , would find himself again spying on Amy . They had almost finished work for the afternoon when the solar wall slipped and fell away from the cell . " Watch out , Amy ! " he shouted . The wall landed without apparent harm , bouncing on the truck tires lying as a buffer on the ground below it . But Amy suddenly grabbed her left hand and squatted to the ground . Her lips went  | white when she tried to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all right , " she said . " Let 's go wash it out , " he said . Over the sink he saw that something sharp on the falling wall , a splinter or nail , had sliced open Amy 's middle finger . In the strange afternoon light the finger looked surreal as bright blood welled up over the white edges of the cut and spilled into the sink . Mixing with water , the blood looked like bright raspberry juice splattered over the stainless steel sink and white kitchen counter . Brother S told Amy to hold her finger tightly in a towel while he peeled open a bandage from the first-aid kit they kept under the sink . His fingers fumbled with the paper wrapping of the bandage as he tried to find the little red string . The bandage slipped from his fingers and fell into the wet sink . " Damn , " he said . Once he realized that there was no little red string , like those on the Band-Aids of his youth , to zip open the bandage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper covering . He remembered that there was some trick to separate the two halves of the protective paper on these new bandages , but his nervous fingers had already torn most of the wet paper to shreds before he could try it . Another failure of progress , as St. Ed would say . When he again washed Amy 's finger he saw the cut was deeper than he 'd thought . From down in the wound a new surge of dark blood began to rise up , and in an impulse to stop the flow and soothe her hurt , he thrust her finger into his mouth . The salty metallic taste of her blood spread onto his tongue . A look of surprise , then tenderness , crossed Amy 's face . He opened his lips and she put all the fingers into his mouth . He sucked on her wound ; she moved closer to him , their faces inches apart , and reached up with her free hand to slowly stroke the back of his neck . When Amy removed her fingers , the wound looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin again . Brother S gently separated the edges of the cut and squeezed some ointment out ofa tube of Bacitracin . Amy sucked in her breath . He quickly pushed the edges of the cut together and tightly taped the bandage around her finger to hold the edges in place . She could probably use a couple of stitches , he thought , but the bandage , if  | tight , should do as well . He felt himselfworking as though he were watching the hands of another in slow motion through a magnifying glass . A piece of gauze went over the bandage , held in place by loops of white adhesive tape peeled from a spool and wrapped around and around her finger until the gauze disappeared under a covering of stiff white tape . The next morning Amy packed her pickup to leave . No doubt she sensed Brother S 's agitation ; he 'd lain awake much of the night in regret over what had happened . The calmness he 'd felt while taping Amy 's finger vanished as soon as he was alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers into his mouth ; he could n't believe the pleasure he 'd felt , the arousal and the desire . At one point he 'd gone to the woodpile where he 'd hidden the lash he 'd used to mortify his flesh when he 'd first come to the hermitage , but he could n't find it . " I 'll be back sometime , " Amy said as she climbed into the pickup . " You 'd better get a tetanus shot for that cut , Amy . " She nodded and smiled . " I 'm sure no doctor could 've fixed it better . " With her injured hand she blew him a kiss and started the truck . " Sweet Jesus , forgive me , " Brother S whispered aloud . " Holy Mary , Mother of Mercy , intercede for me . St. Michael , protect me . " The litany rolled off his lips . At noon , he sat by the pool at Sun Cave exhausted , the strain of Amy 's presence more evident in her absence than when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized how tense he 'd been for the past days . He wished St. Ed would return so that life might revert to normal . Although in some ways it had seemed like a month , only a week had passed , meaning that St. Ed would now stay in Warm Springs through the weekend , returning Sunday night or Monday morning . Something must 've come up to keep him away . At one point Amy had expressed surprise that St. Ed would stay away so long without notifying him , but on the other hand , she said , after one or two days in the hermitage , it was difficult to keep track of time . She did n't know for sure what day of the week it was anymore . She loved that sensation . She could understand why it almost did n't matter how long St. Ed was away ; he was either there or not there . When he was away he  | was n't there , and when he returned he was there , and the time in between did n't matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , " in spirit . " " Is that what he tells you ? " Brother S nodded . " That 's why he does n't send a message on the radio . Though he may not be here bodily , it 's not so important because he 's here spiritually . " " So while you 're stranded alone in the desert , he 's sitting in an air-conditioned trailer watching TV , and he says it 's the same thing ? " " I always feel his presence . " " Oh , brother , " Amy had said . Now he felt Amy 's presence more than St. Ed 's . He thought of her blowing him a kiss , stretching during her yoga exercises , doing arm curls with the dumbbells . " Stop it , " he said aloud . He made an effort to get up and return to the hermitage , but the heat and his own lethargy left him feeling buried in hot sand . He 'd almost finished the solar wall on the guest cell . He was already ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept physically busy the whole time Amy had been there . He had n't been free of temptation , but things might 've been worse . There was a saying of the desert fathers in Egypt that a busy monk is besieged by a single devil , but an idle one is destroyed by spirits innumerable . The only thing he had n't done while St. Ed was gone was to read and study . He could work , but the thought of poring over the Verba Seniorum was more than he could bear at the moment . It was the worst curse of the monk as well as the scholar and artist ? this sullen lethargy in face of the dreary task of reading and writing . How could one overcome such dreariness ? St. Ed had always wanted him to keep a spiritual journal . But in the windy emptiness of the desert , what good would words do him now , flitting here and there through his mind like dry tumbleweeds over a desolate country ? How could ink marks on a page counter the feverish sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the soothing presence of a living voice . Perhaps Amy was right , as she 'd suggested in her sigh , that St. Ed , drawn to the worldly comforts , had left him abandoned in the vastness of unbearable spiritual isolation . He the night of Amy 's question . He wondered why it would n't  | be possible to love another , celibately , of course , while fulfilling all the demands of monastic life . St. Francis and St. Dominic had made room for women in their reformations of monasticism ; in fact , both saints had been great celibate lovers of women to such an extent that St. Dominic , on his deathbed , confessed that although he 'd avoided the stain of physical sin , he 'd enjoyed the pleasure of women 's company all his life . The problem , Brother S thought , was that Dominic was a great saint , a person of immense spiritual will and energy , while he was only a poor hermit struggling to achieve some virtue in the face of constant temptation . What surprised him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . Unlike St. Antony of the Desert , as portrayed in paintings , he did n't feel devils feeding the fires of his lust with bellows fashioned from the hot bodies of naked women . It was n't an image of Amy lying naked on a log that aroused his desire . Perhaps it was a sign of his weakness that the simple memory of her injured hand waving him a kiss aroused a greater ache . How could he be around women if just the memory of her tight denims stretching against her hips , surprisingly broad and majestic as she 'd turned and walked away from him , now so disturbed him that he felt renewed guilt ? Was it only his glands at work ? Like his earlier temptations for a cold beer and a barbecued steak , was his desire simply generated by longings equivalent to a physical itch ? He could not understand why the remembered outline of Amy 's body , clad in black leotards with a hole torn in her stocking , so dominated his imagination ? more so than her naked body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorette at James Lick High School , strutting across California football fields of cellophane green . Her power was at halftime , when she threw back her head , arched her back , and clad in sparkling Spandex so tight that it became her skin , twirled and tossed her baton ; knees pumping , hips swishing , she high-kicked her way across the field and into his heart . It made him wonder whether all the deprivations of the last years had been worthwhile . Not that he regretted the possible pleasures he 'd foregone . Debbie Kovich would no more have cast a loving look at him than at a slug , a snail , a three toed sloth ; she  | never would 've been his to hold , and even if she had been , she would n't have been the same Debbie Kovich of his daydreams . In giving her up he 'd given up no more than a fantasy , which was what , St. Ed said , made America go around . St. Ed said Americans had projected the Debbie Koviches of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all the energy generated by American fantasies in one minute could be harnessed , St. Ed maintained , the cities of the world would have power for a hundred years . Images of celebrities provided Americans with the mythological world they longed for . The result was the most shallow sense of reality human beings had ever had in history . That 's what St. Ed had taught him . No wonder so many people , after a mere twenty or thirty years of existence , with no sacramental sense of time , felt cheated . What he regretted was that all his sacrifices seemed to have left him as impoverished as the day he 'd walked through the hermitage gates , subject to fall over the first temptation on his path . What good did it do to endure discipline and pain if it left him spiritually worthless ? He did n't go up to Sun Cave the following day but sat out of the heat by the side of the refectory , under a cottonwood , dozing off . He felt listless , inert . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again . Even his earlier craving for food failed to return . Images of Amy , floating lazily through his thoughts , failed to tempt him . In his mind he saw her lying naked on the log , drawing up her knee to reveal momentarily , nestling between the fork of her inner thighs , the folds of flesh , and he thought of Straightgut , his disturbing wheezing chuckle over the sexual innuendos of cherry pie and hot dogs nestled in the folds of split buns . He felt as coolly distanced from the image of the girl as from the windy desert wastes spread out before him . Even the arrival of Amy 's boyfriend , or ex-boyfriend , did little to stir him . He watched with the same curious indifference he 'd initially felt toward Amy 's arrival as Jerry 's red pickup pulled into the hermitage . He did n't need to be told who it was . He recognized the blond mustache and scraggly long hair typical ofso many workers at the test site . He wore a sleeveless T-shirt and red cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo on the front . When he swung  | the pickup around , a blue and white personalized license plate flashed : JERRY . Hanging from the gun rack across the back window was a high-crowned black cowboy hat with a feather in the hatband , probably worn when he and Amy went to the western dance clubs . A bumper sticker on the tailgate of the pickup read , TEST SITE WORKERS GET MORE NUKEY . " I 'm looking for Amy , " he told Brother S , who remained seated under the cottonwood . Jerry was tall and a bit thinner than Brother S had expected ? perhaps the toll of drugs ? but his rangy sunburned arms still had the muscles of someone who 'd worked out . He had a long , hard , angular face behind his drooping Wyatt Earp mustache . He stood with his pointy cowboy boots inches from Brother S 's knees . " She 's not here , " Brother S said wearily . He pulled himself to his feet and invited Jerry into the refectory for something to drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with effort . " But she was , right ? You got a cold beer ? " Jerry was probably in his late twenties , but as with most men with mustaches and beards , it was hard to tell age until the gray came in . " Apple juice or water ? " Brother S said . " Amy left yesterday . I assume she was home by lunchtime . " Jerry drummed his fingers nervously on the table as Brother S put out two glasses of juice , bread and honey . He tried to get close enough to see if Jerry really did smell different , as Amy had said . He noted a faint metallic odor , barely perceptible beyond the normal sour smell of a working man 's sweat dried into his Levi 's and T-shirt . As he turned from the refrigerator he thought he saw Jerry popping something into his mouth . " She was here , though , huh ? " Jerry asked . He had a disconcerting way of twitching his eyebrows and mustache as he drummed the table . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He felt the same discomfort as when Straightgut had gotten worked up . It was like a pressure in his brain , confusing him , as he watched Jerry twitch his mouth , although he was n't talking , causing his blond mustache to jump erratically . He chose to be bold , as he 'd been with Straightgut , and told Jerry that Amy had decided to return to the hermitage alter her accident to clear her head of him . He told Jerry he knew how he 'd  | hit her , but that Amy did n't blame him so much as the drugs he 'd been taking . Nevertheless , she was through with him and wanted to get her life back on a healthy track . His tongue thickened strangely as he tried to talk . Jerry 's face grew darker and more glowering , as though he were going through some sinister metamorphosis , looking more and more like the bearded torturers of saints in Caravaggio 's paintings . He wondered whether Jerry had put some sort of drug in his apple juice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though him . He held the edge of the table to better balance him-self . " Well , " Jerry said , " she told me all about you , too , dick-head . " His neon blue eyes , Brother S noticed , remained fixed on him , despite the twitches of his mouth , with a lover 's intensity . " I had nothing to do with Amy 's decision . " He felt strangely detached from his own words . " What occurred was between her and God . You know she had a close call on the desert . She realized the shallowness of her life no longer satisfied her . " " She did , did she ? Shallow , huh ? You priests are all alike . Everybody else 's life is shallow except yours . We were shallow , huh ? Well , I 'll tell you something , dude , we did something you never do . We had fun , man . " He wondered again how Amy had become so attached to Jerry . She 'd said deep down he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother S had a sense of trying to talk to someone of another species . How could you appeal to a rabid coyote through tender emotions ? He felt scared . His words sounded hollow . " I 'm sure if you want what 's best for Amy you 'll leave her alone , to let her find what 's best for herself . " " Ah , do n't give me that crap . How do you think I feel ? How would you like it if I came in messing up your life ? We were in love , man , until she hooked up with you . " Appeals to real sentiment or reason seemed useless . Behind the " love " Jerry mouthed lay instinctive wants and needs . " She did n't hook up with me , " he told Jerry . " She unhooked from you . You hit her . You were brutal to her . Ca n't you underst and t hat ? You need to straighten yourself out . Forget her , and look at yourself . "  | " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his teeth . Brother S could n't understand how Jerry 's watery eyes could stay so brimming full without spilling tears . Then he realized the man did n't blink . He stared with the intensity of someone consumed with love or hate or both . " You do n't know shit . I hit her , huh ? Well , that 's right . And she asked for it , she provoked it . Just like you , pissant . You hear what I 'm saying ? She 's lucky I did n't take her fucking head off . Coming in and calling me every fucking vile piece of no-good fucked-up piece of shit she could think of . She made me feel bad , man . You hear what I 'm telling you ? She was knifing me , she was kicking me in the balls . She was telling me the last three years was nothing but shit . She was killing me , man ? you hear what I 'm saying ? " Brother S had the sensation of watching a grotesque puppet 's face on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face contorted , the head twitched , but the words came from somewhere else , assaulting him , increasing the pressure in his head until it became more than he could bear . With a physical effort he tried to tell Jerry , " Stop it , " as he 'd told Straightgut , but he could hardly speak . " You , " he heard himself say , " had another woman . " He wanted to say more . He wanted to tell Jerry he knew he was suffering , but that he had to look at the cause of that suffering , at his own sins , not Amy 's , whatever they might be . But the room was beginning to darken and tilt . " So that 's what she told you , huh ? Little Miss Hot Pants . Did she tell you who she was balling ? " He saw Jerry 's livid face hanging detached at the end of a darkening tunnel . He was falling away into the darkness and heard himself cry out , " You still ca n't hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now bobbed back and forth as though on a spring . He hit the table with his fist . " Shit , " he said , spitting air . " There 's no use trying to talk to you . " Brother S watched with fascination as Jerry turned the honey jar upside down and a huge yellow glob slowly mounted on a slice of wheat bread . He watched the glistening honey side of the bread come up and smash into his face . He heard Jerry 's voice : " How do you like that , huh ? How does that make you feel ? Huh ? It 's a mess , huh ? And t his ? Are you getting  | the idea now ? Are you going to keep telling people how they 're supposed to feel ? Huh ? " When Brother S 's vision cleared he saw drops of blood splattering on the quarry-tile floor , and he realized he 'd been hit and was sitting on the floor . He thought of Amy 's raspberry blood mixing with his own , becoming one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . He saw Jerry 's boot come up into his face . He felt little pain , only a dull throbbing . He heard Dom and Poverella barking frantically at the screen door . A chair crashed . His face was suddenly flat against the floor . It was as if he 'd been tackled on a football field . Something pressed on his skull . He felt sleepy . He realized someone was shouting at him . Blows thudded against his head and shoulders , but they seemed strangely soft , like the thuds of pillowed sticks used for jousting at Scout camp . He felt himself falling away through black outer space as he had after he 'd broken his arm and was given ether for the first time . As he fell , his own breathing echoed in the cavernous darkness like a clanging bell , and Jerry 's terrible loving face pursued him , shouting , " I 'm me , I 'm me , I 'm me . " It was night when he first awoke . With his face against the floor he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken glass . A tightening ache crossed his face as though someone were pulling the skin from the bone . His shoulder ached . He heard a clicking sound on the floor coming closer ; the dogs had somehow gotten into the room , perhaps when Jerry had left . He heard a whimper as first Dom and then Poverella came over and licked his face . He fell asleep again . When he pulled himself up , it was still dark . He looked at himself in a mirror and saw his face blackened and crusted with blood . He tried to smile and the face in the mirror grotesquely smiled hack . He could see out of only one eye . The other was swollen shut . He poured some water on his hand and touched his lips . They burned . He felt too weak to stand much longer . Fire coursed through his veins instead of blood . When he again opened his eyes , he found himself on the floor  | of his own cell . He was terribly thirsty and poured himself a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to get to the door of the cell to be sick . The dazzling light outside pressed into his eyes , and he longed for darkness again . Lying back down on his bed , he watched his stained hands cross themselves on his chest . Unexpectedly he thought of Sister Alphonsus in grammar school telling the story of St. Lawrence 's martyrdom ? how the great saint , placed on a hot grill by the Roman emperor , had said , " You can turn me over now , I 'm done on one side . " His dry lips managed a smile . There was something almost pleasurable in his own excruciating pain , because he 'd earned it , he deserved it , he thought as he lost consciousness . He dreamed that St. Ed came in the night and placed a soothing hand on his forehead , reminding him how St. Margaret of Cortona had been forgiven for the sin of loving too much . Amy came , too , and helped take off his clothes and wash him . The wet rag was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Amy took his temperature . His whole body was feverish . He felt energy seeping from him , producing the sensation of lightness that is said to come before dying . Amy took off her clothes and spread her body over his like a comforting angel . In the long night she lay next to him ; he moaned and sweated , frightened by terrible dreams , afraid of dying , comforted only when he reached out and felt her body move against his . The sky in the window was pure blue when he awoke , bright as a cartoon sky , with soft clouds in the distance . Sunlight warmed the room . He smelled soup . Amy came through the door with a stock pot and ladle . She wore her hair tied back with a blue bandana , her teeth white as the clouds as she smiled at him . " I thought you were never going to wake up , " she said . She poured apple juice , ladled soup , and lifted his head as she fluffed his pillow . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to take care of you . How do you feel ? " His voice croaked when he tried to speak and Amy giggled . " Here , " she said , " open your mouth . " She spooned some of the hot liquid into his mouth , but it was an effort for him to swallow and he turned his head away . She pulled the sheet to his neck and smoothed it over his chest . " You get some more rest , " she  | said . He did feel sleepy , his eyelids weighted , but he was n't afraid anymore . He felt peaceful , as he lost consciousness , as though he were dozing off on a warm afternoon under a cottonwood . It was dark and no one was in the room ; no sign remained of soup or juice on the table next to his bed . He was alone . It must 've been a dream . He closed his eyes , flooded with disturbing desires and visions . When he awoke , he was thirsty and tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbed , and he was afraid of standing up and passing out . He lay staring at the ceiling for a long time until he heard the door open . He felt a hip depress the mattress , brushing his shoulder , as Amy sat down . She put her hand on his forehead . " Here 's some juice , " she said . So she was n't a dream after all , but whether he 'd earlier been waking or dreaming he could n't tell . St. Ed 's presence had been as real to him as Amy 's . " I called on your ham radio to give a message to St. Ed , " she said . " I do n't know what you want to do , but I 'm worried Jerry might show up again . I started to call Tiny to have him arrested , but I could n't do it . " She meant Tiny Sunderman , the Nye County sheriff " I mean , it would be like sending my own brother to jail . " " Amy , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick man . " " Sick and crazy . I know . But what can we do ? I ca n't do anything for him anymore . Look at what he did to you . When I got back to Tonopah and heard that he 'd left after me , I knew what he was up to . I knew he 'd come out here . He could also hurt someone else . " He wanted to say that he 'd been at fault too , but it was too complicated to explain . He was trying to sort out everything that had happened . " Was St. Ed here ? " he asked . Amy looked surprised . " When ? Since this happened ? " She stroked his forehead . " You were out of it , were n't you ? Do you feel any bones broken ? Is there pain anywhere when you move ? " " My head , " he answered . " I would n't be surprised if you have a concussion . A doctor really should check you out . " " 1 do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just need some rest . "  | " Maybe that 's better . They 'd just zap you with x-rays anyway . I 'll bring you something to eat , and then you can get some sleep . At least you 're better than last night . " " Amy , were you in bed with me last night ? " " Shhh , " she said , " get some sleep . I 'll sleep in the guest cell ? all my things are in there ? but I 'll check on you . We can talk later . " He knew she had been in bed with him ; what he 'd meant to ask was whether they 'd really slept together ? whether they 'd actually made love ? but St. Ed so hated that phrase " making love " that he found himself incapable of saying it , and his fear of knowing what actually had happened kept him from searching for different words . The word intercourse seemed so cold , so technical . He knew they 'd touched each other , he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of desiring Amy , but what he thought happened was too unreal to be believable except in a dream . " Amy , could Jerry have drugged me ? I mean , could he have slipped a drug into my drink without my telling it ? " " It 's possible , " she said , again smoothing the crease of the sheet under his chin . " He 's got everything you could imagine . Maybe that 's why you were hallucinating last night . Get some rest . We 'll talk later . " But he knew he had n't been hallucinating about the pleasurable closeness he 'd felt with her in the night . He 'd had intense dreams of women in the past , only they 'd faded into unreality upon waking . He moved his hand below his waist and felt himself aroused . He could flick the head of his penis with his fingernail , as he 'd been told in the seminary nurses were capable of doing , causing an erection to immediately wither , but he did n't want to . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was frightened by his own defiance . He could understand , as terrible as it was , how a medieval scholar like Abelard , who later became a monk , a man of such passion he could 've been one of the greatest of saints , could say he would accept the flames of hell for the love of Heloise . He hoped he would never go that far in his blindness . Still , he wondered why sin felt this way . If it was sinful for him to have been with Amy , why did that moment produce such closeness ? Why such sweetness ? Why ?  | St. Ed 's Mission If you wish to perform the office of a priest , then live in cities and townships , and make salvation of others the gain of your soul . But if you desire to be what is called a monk , that is a solitary , what are you doing in the city ? ? St. Jerome , " Letter to Paulinus of Nola , " A.D. 395 St. Ed spent the evening on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancellor had rented the room for him ; all the smaller motels in town were full , the chancellor had said , and Circus Circus offered the best rate available . A painting of a clown with red hair and a red nose had greeted him with a tipped hat as he 'd entered the room emblazoned with a bright red rug , red lamp , red bedspread , and red balloons painted on the wall . The wall-length air conditioner labored to keep everything from bursting into flames . He uneasily lay on the red bedspread under the benignly impish gaze of the red clown and watched the TV news . Twenty-one stories below , around the corner of the next block , was the Golden Steer , the restaurant where he and Brother Luke had eaten eleven years earlier , just before Brother Luke was to take his solemn vows . St. Ed had brought him to town for a doc-tor 's appointment ? it was Brother Luke 's first trip away from the hermitage since his arrival ? and he 'd asked if he might have a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows . " Why not ? " St. Ed had replied , remembering Teresa of Avila 's  | response to a woman scandalized when she 'd discovered the saint happily eating a partridge someone had sent her . What would people think : the woman had exclaimed , seeing a holy woman enjoying meat ? " Let them think what they please , " St. Teresa had said . " There is a time for partridge and a time for penance . " But Brother Luke must 've known of his condition , St. Ed reflected . A reformed alcoholic with a reaction to protein , he must 've known he was toying with disaster , although he could n't believe Luke knew how disastrous his actions could be ? unless the temptation of the Golden Steer was so great it had blocked out reality . That was the nature of temptation . It took a heroic vision to see through its beguiling attractions . Brother Luke had ordered prime rib ? the i6-ounce Jim Butler cut ? and fried raviolis , a house specialty , and the gigantic rib had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of horseradish . What a feast ! They were so happy that night , so celebratory . Together they sensed they were at the beginning of a new age , one in which even occasional feasts like this one assumed a sacramental character once again . How could he 've known it would be Brother Luke 's last supper ? He 'd never even heard of a person dying of a protein reaction before . St. Ed felt tears filling his eyes . The TV screen blurred . How far he 'd descended from that night : from a sense of having achieved a blueprint , a way in which contemplative monks might thrive in the final days of a trivial century , to a realization that his own bishop considered his struggles of the last fifteen years nullified . Even his vision of Blue Monks seemed trivial . A failure was how his life appeared to the bishop . A waste . And there was no way he could see his efforts any differently . What had God wanted him to do ? Was the joke on him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red clown smiled and tipped his hat . The picture on the TV switched from a bunch of dogs enjoying Purina Dog Chow to an anchorman with dark slicked-back hair whose words caught his attention . He wiped his eyes and clicked the remote control to increase the sound . He was entranced with the sharp quality of the picture compared to his own snowy set in his trailer . " The Western Shoshone have suffered serious defeats in their  | land-claims battles with the U.S. government , " the anchorman reported ; he looked vaguely like a professional basketball coach St. Ed had once seen on TV . " The Supreme Court has denied certiorari that the Shoshone have any aboriginal or tribal rights to land outside the reservations . " The scene shifted to a press conference in a Reno hotel , where the chief of the Western Shoshone National Council , wearing a beard and a large black cowboy hat , said , " First the government tells us they took our land long ago . Now they say the government sold itself the land as Indian trustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can they take land and then over a hundred years later try to pay for it ? How can they sell something that does n't belong to them ? Nothing has been sold . Our Mother Earth is not for sale . " An Asian-American newswoman with a microphone interviewed Jim Wylie , the lawyer for the Shoshone tribe . The angry , red-bearded lawyer maintained that the federal government had exercised its powers as trustee to defraud the Western Shoshone nation of its land . He also maintained that the government now proposed a genocidal act : installation in the heart of Shoshone country of a murderous facility . " Even the government admits that the waste dump might eventually kill as many as a thousand people through radioactive leakage . How can something be safe that is expected to kill a thousand people ? " The TV scene shifted back to the press conference , where June Mosho sat behind an array of microphones at a table with the Shoshone chief , her sister Dawn , and their attorneys . Behind June Mosho stood her brother Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a beatific smile , much like the clown 's in the painting . " This is nothing new , " June was telling reporters . She spoke in a strong , angry voice . " Look at your own history . Look at the mass murders committed by your own cavalry . Village after village of our people were massacred ? men , women , children , old men , and old women . Your cavalry rode around with native women 's breasts skinned out over their saddle horns . They cut out the vaginas of our young women and hung them from saddle straps . You want to forget that your cavalry also cut open pregnant women ,  | exposing the unborn . The women died in agony with their unborn children . Who killed more innocent people ? Hitler ? Or the United States cavalry ? " Now you use the Indian Claims Commission , the federal district court , the court of appeals , and the United States Supreme Court to take life and land away through treachery and deceit . Once you gave trinkets and bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison . We have no rights , you say , no claims to the land of our ancestors . Payment was made , your Supreme Court says . Payment for what ? It is not payment for the sacred land of the traditional Western Shoshone people . It is the red man who is going to make the government uphold the Constitution . We will not be a people without a country . " The next morning in the first light of dawn St. Ed drove out of Las Vegas . A newsman over the truck radio issued a travelers ' advisory because of heavy winds . As he drove into the ashen hues of the desert , ghostly tumbleweeds skirted across the road . Wind thudded against the truck . He approached Mercury , the DOE complex at the main entrance of the Nuclear Test Site . Dust whipped across the road thick as a fog , forcing him to pull off Rainbow-colored streamers of crepe paper fluttered from a barbed wire fence marking the boundary of the former Peace Camp where protesters had once huddled in pup tents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handcuffed , and dragged into buses . Yellow Caterpillar tractors had clanged and rolled across the screen knocking down shacks . Now nobody was in sight . Only creosote bushes waved their skeletal arms in the wind . He remembered the metal ladders , skeletons with shredded skin , across the street from DOE headquarters and the skinny poplars blowing in the wind like the trees he 'd seen in documentaries about Dachau . He walked through the abandoned camp . A boy in his early twenties dressed in combat fatigues sat in the dirt with his duffle and gear . " I lived in this camp for three years , " the boy told St. Ed . " Then two days ago the BLM posted an eviction notice . Twenty-  | four hours later they were busting heads . I 'm the only one left . I 'm the only one they missed . " St. Ed drove northwest . The wind eased up . He passed the Specter Mountains and the Skeletal Hills . From Lathrop Wells he headed north off the highway on a dirt road toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the ridge of Shoshone Mountain humped up , rising from the desolate flats . From the surrounding stretches of waste , volcanic cones rose like dismal islands . He got out of the truck . An eerie stillness hugged the distant mountain . He gazed through the desert haze to where Shoshone Mountain had lain peacefully for several million years in the aftermath of its fiery birth , stretching and evolving , its scarred sides marked with millennia of winds and storms . Now its belly would become the repository of plutonium too dangerously explosive for nuclear weapons and hundreds of thousands of red-hot canisters of nuclear waste too radioactive to stay in power plants , ready to sizzle out of their containment skins , to boil away surrounding pools of water , and to burrow their way into the earth . Millions of years would pass while the radioactive waste remained hazardous , ready to kill . St. Ed 's mind spun dizzily with numbers . He felt caught in a dream where time sped out of control . The numbers were meaningless . No one could live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless series of five-year plans , ten-year plans , ten-thousand-year plans until people were left stupefied , staring blankly into an ever-receding future of lost time . Who could make sense of radionuclides like cesium 135 and iodine 129 with radioactive lives of over sixty million years and three hundred million years ? Meanwhile , radioactivity ticked on at its own pace ? nature 's clock , beyond human control . On TV June Mosho had invoked the horrors of Hitler . How had people swallowed the propaganda pumped out of the Nazi state machine ? Why did the heavens not darken ? Few were able to believe what was happening around them . Most shared a nightmare of such proportions that they lost their power to snake a distinction between waking and sleeping . They believed , as they 'd been taught , in progress and its technicians .  | Now people would again avert their eyes from the price paid for a collective dream of progress . By burying the waste in Shoshone Mountain , mankind was seeking to bury time . In the distance a chain-link fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards ? crack commando troops specially trained against terrorists , a private army waiting for an invasion ? but he could n't see anyone . Shoshone Mountain looked almost peaceful , shrouded in a dusty haze , but he knew workers scurried over it and into it . Like a leviathan entangled in fluke chains and ready for the tryworks , the mountain had been pierced , trussed , tunneled , and disemboweled . But the beast , not dead , had shifted in surprising ways . Cracks had appeared , and unanticipated leaks , as water bled through fissures . Everything was under control , the experts maintained , while the mountain , refusing to succumb , strained at its tethers . He knew that future generations ? if the human race survived ? were going to look back on the present era as the culmination of a five-hundred-year aberration in human thought . Something terrible had come loose from its human moorings . It was accompanied by an idea so wildly cancerous by now that it had consumed its human hosts , a faith in unseen priests in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites who would control the fire of their inventions . That was the religion of the times he could not abide , yet as the old fighters of heresy in the past ruefully learned , you ca n't fight an idea without being consumed by the idea yourself . That 's why he had no truck with the Franciscans and do-gooders spinning their wheels in demonstrations . That was the trap of the great spinner of ideas himself . He had to go his own way , despite the pain , lost without a faith in the faith of his times . Back on the highway , heading south , he tried to find something distracting on the radio . He caught the last part of what sounded like an oldie . " You 're listening , " the female disc jockey said , " to what was playing in the front seat while you were playing in the back seat . " He switched off the radio . In Beatty he pulled off the road to have a cup of coffee in the Exchange Club . Across the street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Project Office . He found himself getting irritated . He thought of the walls  | of the little desert office lined with pamphlets and brochures for tourists . He 'd been thinking about nuclear waste and the arguments surrounding it since he 'd left Las Vegas . The back of his pickup was weighted with three boxes of reports Ms. Yerkes had insisted he take . He 'd avoided taking the full eighteen-volume report ? " It 's as wide as this car , " she 'd told him as she 'd driven across town . He successfully foisted the report onto the bishop , telling Ms. Yerkes she could mail it to the chancellor for the diocesan library , where a lot of clergy were sure to use it . That , she thought , was a fine idea , and a good use of taxpayer funds . Even without the full report , his mind was cluttered with enough numbers and details to plague him for weeks . He 'd wasted two days arguing with Gil Davis and other DOE people on their terms , the situation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he was the monk who 'd appeared opposite the DOE spokeswoman on " Nevada People . " He 'd even spent a whole afternoon running around with her . Meanwhile , many days had passed since he 'd written one word on The Death of Time . His contemplative life was going down the tubes . But survival came first . His only recourse was to organize the few far-flung outcasts he knew into something capable of confronting the threatening institutions and their bishoprics . That 's what Bernard of Clairvaux had done when he brought peasants into his monasteries as lay brothers , thousands and thousands of them . The White Monks had exploded across Europe and beyond , spreading from Norwegian fjords to Polish marshes , from Swedish forests to Catalonian sierras , from British riversides to Cyprean mountains . But shortness of time ? the days were speeding toward the bishop 's deadline ? made all the more urgent his need to solidify his single hermitage of Blue Monks . It was all he could do . In Warm Springs he ignored the red eye , blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered a summons from the Las Vegas Police Department . An automatic camera had taken a picture of him making an illegal U-turn the day he 'd been on Nathan Spock 's TV show . An automatic ticket machine , one of many now situated at the city 's intersections , had issued him the ticket , complete with a photo of his license plate , noting that his vehicle had been traveling at 21.8 MPH on 6/17 at 12:27 P.M. when the infraction occurred . It was that damn impulse for a  | Dairy Queen freeze , he remembered , a wicked longing , ultimately unsatisfied , compounded by a machine 's mindless vengeance . In the same pile of mail another computer-produced ticket had arrived from the Nevada State Highway Patrol , issued three days later , citing his vehicle for traveling 83.4 MPH north on Interstate 15 at 8:09 P.M. Two infractions within a week . Witnesses for the prosecution : two machines . He wondered if the judge in court would be a machine that would spew out a computer-determined verdict and fine . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he vowed to keep driving until the machines came to lock him away . The next morning at Sunday mass , he told his congregation , " There is only one world , but there are layers to that world . " His congregation , smaller than usual ? because of the biker races taking place in the desert that morning ? listened impassively . " Our subjective selves ? our sources of energy ? depend on what layers of the world we tap into . We are what we believe . It all comes down to what traditions of faith energize us . " " What were you trying to say this morning ? " Mrs. Scully asked after mass . " I have n't heard such drivel since I tried taking a UNLV extension course in modern poetry . " Stung by the rebuke , he tried to hold his tongue ? conscious of the trouble he 'd already be in with the bishop for his traffic tickets ? but the woman 's smugness was more than he could bear . " Kiss it , " he told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash . " I do n't believe what I heard you say , " she said . She turned her head in search of aid , but only Pete Ylarregui , the old Basque prospector and friend of Straightgut 's , seemed to have heard . He stood next to Mrs. Scully laughing . " What are you laughing at ? " she asked him . " You heard what he said . " Pete nodded . " He told you to kiss his ass . Are you going to do it ? " St. Ed recovered himself . " I was speaking metaphorically , Pete . We all sometimes need to kiss , or embrace , what we ca n't under-stand . " " I 'm calling the bishop , " Mrs. Scully said . " What else is new ? " St. Ed said . " He 's heard it all before . " " This time I 'm not stopping until you 're out of ' here . " " Maybe it would be easier if you just got out of here yourself . "  | " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aid with a smile . " You 're the one , Mabel , who 's here like a wet kiss at a family reunion . " He was pretty sure that Pete 's words would be construed as his own . His trouble with the bishop would deepen . That afternoon he walked into the desert hills north of town . The trailers of Warm Springs disappeared as he dropped into the folds of hills where the hot wind swirled , its sound magnified , as though he were inside the roar of a huge seashell . His shirt and grey cowl flapped wildly . He felt grit between his teeth ; he tried to breathe through his nose . He came upon a rise and the ground fell away as if opening into a view of outer space , laced with cosmic dust . The vast emptiness stretched away from him into a vague horizon ; pale dust devils twisted in the distance . Feeling small and lonely , he listened to the wind , now almost like an inhuman whisper , ever-present , coming from distant spaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filling him with a sense of the unmistakable presence of a supreme power not felt in the glittering city , where it was still possible to believe that humans were the measure of all things . He listened to the voice of the wind . He approached the remains of Pete Ylarregui 's monument on the dirt mining road leading back into town . The monument represented Pete 's protest against despoliation of the desert . Upset by all the bedsprings , tires , broken TV sets , and other trash that people dumped from their cars and trucks , Pete had walked the desert at night to gather it all up . A former truck driver handy with tools , he 'd used an acetylene torch and welder to fashion a huge pyramid sculpture of scrap iron , broken couches , refrigerator parts , and other junk he 'd found strewn across the desert . Sometimes at night men in pickups would stop to help him gather the trash . On top of the pyramid he 'd placed a hand-carved shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe and a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid he 'd made signs composed of flattened tin cans , so they glittered in the sun , saying : CLEAN UP YOUR ACT ? WARM SPRINGS ? OR LOSE IT ? FOREVER ? AND THIS MEANS YOU ? WITH I LOVE ? PETE YLARREGUI . On the previous Fourth of July , vandals had trashed the monument , scattering much unlit. debris across the desert once again .  | Pete let it stand unrepaired , a testament to vandalism . " I was just trying to reclaim the desert , " Pete had told St. Ed , " but if people like garbage better , let them live with the mess they made . " The BLM was threatening him with eviction if he did n't clean it up soon . He lived alone on BLM land in the hills behind Warm Springs in a renovated 1965 Chevrolet school bus painted Williamsburg blue . As St. Ed approached the bus he thought he saw through the windshield the movement of someone 's head , but the doors were closed , and when he peered through the windows , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus seats and installed a propane stove , cabinets , beds , and a clothes rack where his clean shirts and pants hung neatly pressed in a row across the back of the bus . For years he 'd lived with an old prospecting partner , Marty Sims . They 'd slept in two bunks , side by side , a foot apart from each other , until Marty had died of cancer the previous spring after a brief hospitalization . When Pete announced the sudden death to St. Ed , he 'd simply said , " Old Marty sure did n't last long . " Together , Pete and Marty had gathered aluminum cans from the desert to finance their prospecting ventures . St. Ed once asked if there were enough cans to be found . " Hell , " Pete told him , " if we wanted to work , we could make a couple of hundred dollars a day just picking up cans . " Three or four times a year they 'd drive across Tioga Pass to cash in their cans in Fresno , where they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prospected alone , except when he came to Sunday mass or went to soak his arthritic feet in Straightgut 's hot springs . He claimed Warm Springs had grown too crowded to use the hot pools there anymore ; he talked of moving as soon as he finished working his claim outside of town . He was n't lonely , he once told St. Ed ; his wife , dead now for twenty-three years , was still with him . Marty was with him , too . He talked to them every day . St. Ed saw Pete 's pickup parked in front of the muddy moat on the dirt road to Straightgut 's dugout , the back of the truck loaded with black plastic bags presumably filled with crushed aluminum cans . Inside the doorway of the dugout he found the two men on rough wooden benches dishing out a lunch of what looked like canned beef stew and creamed corn , probably Pete 's treat .  | Straightgut sopped up gravy from his tin plate with a piece of bread and began to eat . Neither man offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching the men eat . He told them about the threat of eviction or contamination they shared from the new nuclear waste dump . Trucks with high-level waste would soon run through Reveille Valley . " Hell , " Pete said , " I do n't have anything against the dump in itself . It has to go somewhere . I just do n't think they need to make people move . " Straightgut remained quiet , while Pete , always talkative , scooped up food with a spoon and told St. Ed that the trucks hauling waste were n't anything to worry about . He used to drive nuclear material all over the country when he worked for Tri-State . He hauled nuclear rods from Los Alamos to California and waste to Rocky Flats . " I felt much safer than when I had to haul flammable liquids , " Pete said . " But your average John Q. Public is going to be afraid of what he do n't understand . " He said that when he used to pull into a rest stop and cordon off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would clear out , and he 'd always get a place to himself " People would be abusive to me on their CBs , but I knew it was just their fear of the unknown . " When Straightgut finished the last of the stew , he asked St. Ed , " Want to come in for a cup of coffee ? " " Sure , " St. Ed said . He ducked his head to enter the dugout . Pete put away his empty tin plate and slid over to make room for him on the bench while Straightgut went to the stove to boil water . " Sorry we ca n't offer you any lunch , " Pete said . " We just ate it all . " " I noticed , " St. Ed said . " At least they 're not throwing nuke waste all over the desert the way people do other trash and toxic wastes , " Pete said . " They put that stuff in containers like you would n't believe . " " The problem is keeping it in containers , " Straightgut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black coffee into tin cups . " Oh , there 's no way you can keep it from leaking completely . I never hauled a load that did n't leak some . " Pete said that once he was hauling a load of waste from the state of Maryland to the U.S. Ecology dump in Beatty when the tarp came loose . The wind was blowing like hull . He climbed up all over the rig trying to tie the tarp down . Of course , he could n't see inside the containers ? he  | never saw with his own eyes the actual rods or waste he hauled ? but when he circled the truck with his geiger counter , it chattered . " When I reached the dump , " Pete said , " that load was so hot they buried the whole damn rig , cab and all . " Pete laughed . " That was the hottest load I ever hauled , some twenty years ago , and here I am to tell you about it . " St. Ed reflected that if Pete talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , then spirits either did n't talk back or they enjoyed hearing a nonstop living voice with more patience than he had . He wondered if there was any way Pete could endure the silences of a hermitage . But he would not be the first desert rat who moved easily between extremes of garrulity in company and silence in solitude . Straightgut asked if Brother S had finished the new solar guest house he was working on , but St. Ed replied that he had n't been to the hermitage for a week and a half . Straightgut said the latest issue of Popular Science had an interesting article on new ways to use solar energy as fuel . He wanted to send it on to Brother S. " I 'm sure he 'll appreciate having it , " St. Ed said . " It 's the way of the future , " Straightgut said . " This nuke energy has hit a dead end . They just ca n't deal with the waste . " Pete objected . " They 'll figure something out . Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why ca n't we ? It 's going to be just a matter of time before they figure out some way to speed up the decay so you do n't have to wait thousands of years for the stuff to neutralize . " Straightgut scoffed . " Promises , " he said . " Look at me . They said everything was safe , and then they burned me . " " Nuclear fuel is the cleanest fuel there is , " Pete said , looking pointedly at St. Ed . " If you take all the people who 've died from nuclear accidents in this country , they would n't add up to one airplane crash . Now Straightgut 's problem here is something else . That comes from the days when they did n't know what they were doing . But these hot springs should help keep him all right . Look here . " Pete pulled up his sleeve and pointed to the liver spots on the back of his hand and arm . " I had skin cancers all over this arm , but the radium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down his cup . " What 's that ? " he shouted .  | A clattering sound outside grew louder as the men left the dugout to see a helicopter descending toward them , its blunt grasshopper nose growing larger until it hovered in front of them just above the ground , its tail wavering gently back and forth , blades shuddering , whipping up violent swirls of dust . Pete stuck his fingers in his ears and squinted against the blowing sand . St. Ed 's cowl beat against his neck . He could n't believe the BLM was flying a helicopter on such an unpredictable , gusty day . A loudspeaker squawked above the noise . " THIS IS A FINAL WARNING . YOU ARE TRESPASSERS ON PUBLIC LAND . EVACUATE THE AREA OR YOU 'LL BE ARRESTED . REPEAT : EVACUATE THE AREA , OR YOU 'LL BE ARRESTED . THIS IS PUBLIC LAND . YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON PUBLIC LAND . " Blades roaring , the racket of the helicopter kept him from hearing Pete 's shout at first , until he felt a pull at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , " at Straightgut , who 'd come out of the dugout with a rifle with a long scope and was aiming it toward the helicopter . Gunfire mixed with the noise of the clattering helicopter , but he did n't know if Straightgut had fired or the BLM officers were firing at him . Pete and St. Ed both converged on Straightgut , knocking his pith helmet to the ground as they struggled to wrench the rifle from him . Straightgut 's red face twisted in anger ; his eyes looked crazy . St. Ed pulled the rifle free and turned to see the helicopter rise rapidly as it backed away , pivoting like a weathervane , point its nose south , and climb into the sky , its chatter diminishing . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , " Pete shouted , his voice as high as a girl 's . " They 're getting serious . " " We 've got to stick together through this , " St. Ed told Pete . He realized he was shouting , too . His fingers around the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bib overalls strapped over bare shoulders . His pith helmet lay on the ground next to him , upside down , rocking on its crown . He covered his forehead and his eyes with his palms . " I do n't believe these fuckers , " Pete said . " Ca n't they leave us little guys alone ? " " It 's only the big guys they leave alone , " St. Ed said . " That 's why  | we 've got to stick together . I want you to come to the hermitage with me . " Straightgut uncovered his eyes and cried out , " Do n't let them hurt me anymore . Please , tell them , please , I 'm sorry .

It was the kind of bus that as a kid in the San Joaquin Valley he 'd seen loaded down with field workers . He half expected the bus to evacuate homeless druggies and unemployables , professional students and Communist sympathizers , gathered from the Peace Camp and the streets of Las Vegas to swell the ranks of the hermitage . When the bus doors folded open , he was relieved to see only one bearded old man , Pete Ylarregui . With mixed longing and anxiety , he 'd awaited St. Ed 's return . Fearing the consequences of confessing about Amy , he simultaneously looked forward to St. Ed driving her from the hermitage so that things could return to normal . He 'd halfheartedly tried to get her to go himself ; but she claimed that she had no intention  | of leaving him alone , given his violent headaches and blackouts since her ex-boyfriend had beaten him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They 'd lived separately and chastely since that night after his beating , but her presence was becoming more than he could bear . She intended to hang on until she could confront St. Ed face to face about staying at the hermitage . " What fetid owlshit is this ? " St. Ed asked , as he looked first at Brother S 's battered face and then at Amy , who stood to the side in tight jeans and a white shirt tied in a Daisy Mae knot above her tanned navel . Alone with St. Ed in the abbot 's office , Brother S told his story . Out of shame he said nothing of the terrible thoughts that had scourged him after the night Amy , or a vision of her , had crawled into his bed , and St. Ed gave no indication of caring if anything of the sort had occurred . He only wanted to know how Brother S felt , whether he thought he needed to see a doctor . Nine days had passed since he 'd last seen St. Ed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement , as he announced what he called the bright , joyful news that the Hermitage of Solitude in the Desert would henceforth be known as the Hermitage of the Transfiguration in the Desert . Brother S was further surprised and dismayed when he later talked to Amy after she 'd spent a half-hour alone with St. Ed . " He said I could stay , " Amy announced . " He did n't say it would be for long , but until the Feast of the Transfiguration he said I could be a postulant , just like that new guy ? Pete ? as long as I get out of these prick tickling ' clothes . That 's exactly what he said , prick tickling ' ? I could hardly believe it . He never quite says what you expect . " " I never thought he 'd let you stay . " " I told him I just wanted him to give me a chance ? to prove that I can do it . " " Being a monk is a hard life , Amy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on that desert . I know what matters now . " St. Ed also wanted to know if she could sew . " I told him I can do almost anything except sew , but he said this sewing would be simple , just some blue tunics and cowls , once he found the right material . "  | St. Ed 's plans , he heard the next morning at mass , were not only to change the name of the hermitage , but also to inaugurate a new order , the Monks of the Transfiguration , or , as he called them for short , the Transfigurines . Like Bernard of Clairvaux , he would welcome those previously excluded from monastic life ; such moments always enlivened monasticism , he said , without necessarily weakening its strictures , for no one was more austere , or difficult in his rule , than Bernard , who eventually had to ease up to keep his monks from dying of starvation and overwork . The next week St. Ed drove into town and came back with two new postulants : Ralph from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Amherst , a young man with an owl 's expression behind horn-rimmed glasses , wore a soiled white shirt , shiny black polyester slacks , and scuffed black leather shoes that made him look like a rejected seminarian from the fifties . Brother S remembered how ten years earlier he 'd had to hitch rides and walk miles through sagebrush and greasewood to reach the hermitage . He also knew how Brother Luke had walked those last miles through a hailstorm . Yet St. Ed had to fetch these losers , who would n't have found their way without him . Amherst had delicate hands that seemed to collapse at the wrists when he picked up a shovel at St. Ed 's orders to dig a hole for a new , larger latrine fashioned with a row of seats . Berkeley almost set fire to the kitchen as gas escaped for a minute or so while he struggled before the stove to ignite match after match with shaking fingers . " We are now six , " St. Ed announced to the group one night during compline . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly together in Paris to form a spiritual comradeship . Thus began the Company of Jesus that grew to shake the world . " The implicit comparison St. Ed made between himself and " that amazing Basque , " Ignatius of Loyola , founder of the Jesuits , bothered Brother S. The Jesuits seemed to him the most worldly of religious orders , the one least likely to serve as a model for a contemplative order . St. Ed 's vainglory , his obsession with success in the eyes of the world , was troublesome . In his plans for the Feast of the Transfiguration he seemed bent only on making a splash . It was n't until he announced to the group the bishop 's threat that Brother S understood . A large and successful celebration of '  | the Feast of the Transfiguration would call public attention to the hermitage and its need to exist . The bishop would succumb to the power of the spirit made manifest . He would recognize the value of the hermitage , relinquish his threat , and become its supporter against the DOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the harebrained trip Francis of Assisi made to Egypt , believing his personal appeal to Sultan Malek al-Kamel would bring a halt to the bloody crusades . Yet stranger things had succeeded . Who could 've predicted that in the sixteenth century Teresa of Avila , with only two friars ? or as she said , " one and a half , " jokingly referring to her little friend and companion John of the Cross , not even five feet tall ? could reform her entire monastic order and recover for all of Spain the ancient Unmitigated Rule of the Carmelites ? It was like the parable of the mustard seed : from little beginnings great things grow . When he spoke of St. Teresa of Avila , " that beautiful and magnificent woman , " St. Ed grew animated , his eyes cast a searching sidelong glance toward Amy , his head bobbed excitedly , and his lips spread into an idiotic smile that disgusted Brother S. Things were going to hell in a handbasket . St. Ed not only had n't kicked Amy out , he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the help of Berkeley , Amy had made blue cowls for them all . Berkeley , after he 'd quit playing with matches , turned out to be able to sew , weave , make moccasins , and plait sandals , while Amherst , though of little use with outdoor tools , loved to cook and took over many of Brother S 's kitchen duties . St. Ed wanted the postulants to perform all the chores , and it was Brother S 's responsibility , as prior , to rotate assignments . It was also his responsibility to rotate work partners . St. Ed wanted to foster a sense of community but to avoid exclusive friendships . Nevertheless , Brother S found himself often assigning Amy and Pete Ylarregui to his own work detail so he could get on with the building and gardening . They all gathered together daily in the chapel for services in their new blue cowls , brilliant as the morning Nevada sky . " You must understand , " St. Ed told them , " that you 're still just postulants . You can wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ceive religious habits until the first profession of your vows . " St. Ed made it clear that his new order was not to be lax in its rules . The traditional vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience were to be the goals of each if they passed the probationary period of observation . Wearing the cowls in chapel was a way of " trying on " what they might permanently become until death . He announced other changes . In combining the best from eremitical and cenobitical traditions , the week would be divided into three parts . Monday and Tuesday would be days of complete solitude , each monk privately fasting , studying , and meditating in his or her individual cell . Wednesday through Saturday , the community would return to the primitive rule of Pachomius as modified by St. Benedict ? a balanced life of communal work , study , and liturgical prayer . Sunday would be wholly celebratory , a day of communal feasting and play . " We were losing our balance , " St. Ed told Brother S. " Now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have more time for study and contemplation . " " The bees do n't know what day of the week it is , " Brother S replied . " Somebody has to gather the honey . " " Maybe we should get rid of those fucking bees , " St. Ed said . Study , directed , of course , by St. Ed himself , was to be central to the life of a Transfigurine Monk . Like the early Cistercians , the Blue Monks were to be instrumental in recovery of lost religion , but unlike those first Cistercians , they were to foster ties to that religion through the life of the mind , especially through a love of the old books , voices from the past . Even Pete , who 'd previously read Louis L'Amour and Elmer Kelton westerns ? his bus held cardboard boxes of dog-eared paperbacks ? learned to enjoy the Sayings of the Fathers and Thomas Merton 's little New Directions paperback , The Wisdom of the Desert . Amherst proved to have more than a smattering of Latin and Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other esoteric texts . But it was Amy who surprised everyone with her love of reading and her eye for the telling historical detail . Her assignment was to research the double monasteries of early monasticism . Each postulant presented verbal reports to the entire community once a week , followed by communal questioning . " Remember , " St. Ed said , quoting Guigo ,  | the great shaper of twelfth-century Carthusian hermitages , " books are the everlasting food of our souls ; we wish them to be most carefully kept and to be zealously made . " Brother S resented the ease with which the postulants could choose reading of their own interest ; he 'd been forced to plow through assigned Latin texts . He 'd been denied the gnostics and mystics . " You had to be brought down to earth , " St. Ed told him ; " these others need to be lifted to heaven . There is no comparison . You came here already blessed . " Brother S felt flattered but troubled . What bothered him were all the changes ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each postulant received orders to write at least one hour a day ; it did n't matter what ? personal reflections , poems , stories , meditations . It was a good exercise for many reasons . St. Ed reminded Brother S of what Abbo of Fleury maintained : " After prayer and fasting , the practice of literary composition does most to bridle the lusts of the flesh . " As St. Ed stared at him with the yellow glare of a mongoose , Brother S wondered whether his abbot sensed the torments he was experiencing with greater frequency . Demons , he was sure , had come to possess him . From the icy indifference he 'd formerly felt while listlessly staring out at the vast , empty spaces of the desert , able neither to run away nor to work , sodden with boredom and loathing for his wasted life , he swung madly now into a hotly lustful mood . He awoke at night in an agitated sweat , on his back , his groin burning , the sheet tensely pointed skyward . He pulled the damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the slick , dark head of his penis wavering in a trance , rising in search of the hypnotic strains of some eerily silent flute . Taut , engorged , aching , it seemed ready at the merest brush of fingertips to spit fire . He groaned aloud . It was n't the physical desire alone that tormented him . He 'd had erections and emissions , nocturnal and diurnal , all his life . In the seminary such was accepted as simply a fact of life , a part of what it meant to be human trying to live as they did . As he gazed at his erect penis , he remembered the poem he 'd composed in high school , in a mischievous mood ? before he 'd discovered his calling ? in response to the English class he  | intensely disliked . The ditty quickly made the rounds among his classmates . I must have been dreaming of sirens ? Harlow or Bardot Moreau or Monroe ? for when I awoke my prong was flagpole stiff forming the bedsheet into a minor Everest . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come into the hands of his English teacher , a young Jesuit scholastic with red hair who advised him , with a mischievous glint in his own eye , that his poetry would be much improved if he learned a few techniques , such as inversion , to avoid chiming rhymes . " Does n't it sound much better to invert mixed ' and metaphor , ' " the scholastic asked him one day after football practice , " and say Now there 's a metaphor , mixed for you fuckers ' ? " Oh , they were a sophisticated lot , those young California Jesuits , wise to the ways of the world , the flesh , and the devil , a far remove from pious Sister Alphonsus in grammar school , who upon seeing such a verse in his hand would 've interpreted it ? if she had n't first had a mild cerebral hemorrhage ? as the sign of a soul on the road to damnation . No , lusts of the flesh , often unaccountable , beyond his control , propelling his genitals into action at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , that he 'd accepted as a means of spiritual growth . Even St. Augustine found erections so beyond human control that he was convinced they were proof of man 's lack of free will . What made his daily torments now so unbearable was that they were no longer accompanied by obscure fantasies ? no Harlows or Bardots , no Moreaus or Monroes ; instead , they were driven by visions of the real woman who labored with him daily , sang next to him in choir with a voice as beautiful as his own , and slept peacefitlly in her cell just yards away , where he might now  | see her in the flesh , if he could bring himself to do it , simply by crossing the yard and peering through her window . On Sunday he 'd felt excited during their afternoon of play , when she and he sang " In Canaan Land , " a cappella , to the delight of St. Ed and the rest of the community . She had a stunning voice , a warm , earthy soprano that soared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the feeling of charged air as they sang , like the dry electric crackle in desert air just before heat lightning , the song they shared no doubt stirring their bodily electrons into sympathetic vibrations . No vague sexual fantasy visited him that night , but the clear memory of her , as he 'd actually seen her , lying naked , stretched out on a cottonwood log , her leg lifting toward him , revealing soft interstices enfolded there and longing for him . That image of Amy so inviting , so painfully pleasurable , dimmed in the shadows of a memory , lurking on the edges of consciousness , of that night after his beating when she 'd climbed into his bed . He never talked to her about it . He could n't confess it had ever happened . He never mentioned it to St. Ed . It was a dark blur on the horizon . Remorse weighed on him like wet sand all the next day as he worked with Pete and Amy on a new hermitage cell . From a distance , for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , he could n't distinguish Amy from Pete , both dressed in loose-fitting khaki pants and shirts , wearing straw hats , Amy 's hair lifted unseen under the crown to let air cool her neck . He could hear Pete whistling , as he usually did , happy after a life of many trades to be heading toward becoming a lay brother , something he 'd once aspired to after seeing some Franciscans in the mission garden at San Luis Obispo when he was a kid . The whistling reached his ears ? a version of " Red River Valley " ? but for a moment in the glare of sunlight he could n't distinguish the source ; the two distant khaki-clad figures looked like twins , sexless or androgynous . What was it then about Amy that drove him into such nights of torment ? Was it only genetic conditioning , the offshoot of the species ' need to renew itself ? Or was his desire really propelled by her individual characteristics , the way she squinted when talking to him , the way her voice changed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own song , sharing with him something deep in their feelings  | about who and where they were , what they thought and felt about this mysterious world ? What did these have to do with fucking ? Was it not possible to love even more intensely and awarely when freed from bondage of the glands ? At night the demons returned , and during the days , exhausted from hours of tossing and turning , he found himself now scourged as he 'd formerly been only at night ; in chapel or the garden or the huts they were building , wherever Amy came near , he felt his throat constrict , his breathing quicken , his skin tighten . His dry lips cracked , his cheekbones protruded , and his blue eyes assumed an unblinking , fractured , crazed stare . St. Ed told him one day , " You look like death . What 's eating you ? " He could n't tell him . He feared St. Ed would do something unpredictable if he confessed his desire for Amy . He knew his lust was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his spirit . " I feel we 've lost our way , " he told St. Ed . " You said we were going back to our origins , but we 're no longer hermits . We 're a crowd . " " So ? " St. Ed responded . That evening Amherst gave a report . As if in direct response to Brother S 's concern , he said that it seemed impossible to get hack to the origins of the desert fathers . Antony the Hermit was often credited as being the first monk in the third century , but there were many others before him in the Egyptian desert ; we just did n't know their names . The image of a few isolated hermits in the wastelands of Scetis was a myth , he said . Almost as soon as the desert fathers began wandering out to their caves and huts in the barren mountains of Scetis and the plains of the Thebaid , t hey gathered into colonies , and tourists rushed to the deserts in droves to see these eccentrics . Antony moved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress on the edge of the desert to get away from gawkers , but growing numbers of sightseers and disciples eventually drove him to a remote cave near the Red Sea . I lundrt'ds , thousands of monks peopled the deserts , and Antony himself came out of solitude to found and direct many comrminities . Even the most radical of solitaries , Sirneon the Stylite , in ( ) ved from the hermitages ofnorthern Syria to a pillar to escape  | onlookers and pilgrims . But as the height of his stylos grew , so did the crowds . From his platform , over sixty feet above the ground , Simeon ministered to the multitude every afternoon for over thirty years , preaching , answering questions , giving down-to-earth advice . He converted Arabs and Persians , Armenians and Romans . Emperor Theodosius and Emperor Marcian , as well as Pope Leo I , sought his prayers and counsel . Brother S began to feel that St. Ed and the others were conspiring against him . Amy gave a report about early abbesses among the desert fathers , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matrona . " Women and men were both called monks , " Amy said . " Over thirty thousand of them lived in the deserts of Egypt and Syria . In the Middle Ages , both men and women lived in double monasteries , where many of the leaders were women . They were aware of the wisdom of Abba Longinus , who said , Unless you first amend your life among others , you wo n't amend it dwelling alone . ' " Brother S felt attacked for his two deepest beliefs about what was bringing ruin to the hermitage : the presence of a woman and the loss of solitude . But why ? he asked himself . Why could n't he adjust to change ? In some ways , as St. Ed had pointed out , with the new schedule of complete isolation on Mondays and Tuesdays he had more time for solitary meditation than before . The problem , he knew , went deeper than the surface of daily life in the monastery . He no longer was who he 'd envisioned himself as becoming for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Now he was a lapsed monk lusting for a woman , no longer pure , no longer special . He 'd killed that saintly visionary he 'd upheld as an ideal , and he no longer knew who he was . " Are you sure you do n't need to see a doctor ? " St. Ed asked him , worried that he 'd suffered a concussion . " Or are you dwelling on that son of a bitch who beat you up ? " Yes , he was dwelling on what had happened to him , but it was Amy , not Jerry , who obsessed him ? that 's what he wanted to say . But still unable to confess what was on his mind , he said , " I have no resentment against Jerry . I 've forgiven him . " " It 's not for you to forgive that crud , " St. Ed said . " That 's God 's business . It 's only for you to return no harm for the harm he 's  | done you . You 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He bashed you pretty good . You 're just not yourself . " " I 've told you before , I think we 've lost our way . That woman and the others should go . " " On the contrary , we 're finding our way , at last . We 're on the road to restoring the original primitive way of the desert , with a balance between community and solitude , men and women . Was n't that a lovely report Amy gave the other night ? " Out of his bushy beard , St. Ed 's moist lips spread into an uncharacteristic saccharine smile , his eyes tilted heavenward for a moment , like a dreamy martyr being shot with arrows in a baroque painting . That night Brother S pounded his fists on the stiff mattress of his cot . " Fuck , cunt , piss , shit , tit . " The words came from his lips like a chant , beyond his control . Shredded feathers , belly button lint , spider webs ? sticky , thready fluff seemingly sputtered from his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see nothing , and the more he rubbed his dry lips , the more thickly coated with fluff they felt . " Lord , help me , " he prayed , " rid my thoughts of that malicious bitch . No , no . Pray for her , I pray for her , the fuck , the cunt . Who does she think she is ? Why ? Why ? Get her out of here . Why does n't she go ? Oh , the bitch , the sweet bitch . Come , come . " The next day Straightgut arrived on his three-wheeler with chicken eggs . St. Ed invited him into the refectory for lunch , but Straightgut , seeing Amy in the distance , refused . He said he 'd left the water running in his garden and had to get back . " He really belongs here in the hermitage , " St. Ed later told Brother S. " He 's a natural , and with everything he knows , he could really help out . " " But he 's never shown any signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not born , " St. Ed reminded him . " Cazdmon was just a stuttering servant when the Abbess Hilda took him into Whitby , and look at what a great monk and poet he became . Believe me , Straightgut has the stuff to make a monk . What if he becomes another Caedmon ? " St. Ed seemed obsessed with the fact that the community was composed ofsix , instead of seven , and he increasingly saw  | Straightgut as the missing seventh . His obsession revealed itself in homilies on the divine importance of signs and symbols . There were the Seven Sacraments , the Seven Cardinal Virtues , even the Seven Deadly Sins . Combining the number four , symbolizing the earth and its four directions , with the number three , symbolizing heaven and the trinity , seven came to signify the completeness of the universe , as in the seven days of creation and the seven seas . Six was an incomplete number , identified historically with the devil . There were Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost , Seven Last Words from the Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Works of Mercy , Seven Joys and Seven Sorrows of St. Mary the Virgin . Like the gathering around that other Basque , Ignatius , the initial core community of the Transfigurine monks would also number seven if Straightgut joined them . One afternoon he 'd been working with Amy on the movable solar wall of a new cell , similar to the one that had fallen on her hand weeks earlier . They 'd been working in silence , leaving him free to concentrate on the pleasurable torment of working close to her , engrossed in thoughts of her unseen attributes beneath her loose , mannish clothes , when he noticed her eyes watering . They 'd been working alone ? Pete was helping Ralph in the garden that day ? and she 'd been morose and silent all morning . Now tears quietly cut wet tracks through the dusty patina on her cheeks . It was a hot , dull , airless afternoon , and when he asked what was wrong , she reached out to him and put her arms around his neck . " I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Ed said things just do n't seem to be working out . " He listened in disbelief as she described how St. Ed had told her that as much as he admired all her efforts , he was afraid the hermitage was not the place for her . It had nothing to do with her abilities or dedication , but with the nature of the hermitage itself . He was n't sending her away at that moment , but he felt he had to give her a warning so that she would n't be inordinately disappointed if she was n't accepted as a novice . " Straightgut ! " Brother S blurted out . They had moved to the shady side of the cell and sat side by side in the dirt . " He wants Straightgut here for some reason , and he thinks he wo n't come unless you go . "  | " That 's what I thought , but if I go and Straightgut comes , it 's an even exchange ? there are still just six . He has n't gained anything . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brother S 's skin grew feverish . Amy was sitting right next to him . Her warm body pressed against his side . Sweat broke out on his forehead . The tops of his hands prickled . " It 's me , " he heard himself say to Amy . His voice sounded strange . " He senses you 're a temptation to me . " Amy shook her head and seemed to lean into him . " No , " she said , " I have n't said anything to him about us , about that night . " " He must sense something . " " No , " Amy repeated . " It 's my underpants . " Brother S looked at her , uncomprehending , his face running with sweat . " Someone stole a pair of my underpants from the clothesline . I did n't say anything about it , but then it happened again , and I mentioned it to St. Ed . " He felt shocked and outraged . He remembered those underpants he 'd washed and the temptations he 'd fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpants and was fondling them , lusting after her . Ralph ? Pete ? Teddy ? Which of them would be so sneaky , so hypocritical , going daily to chapel , sitting next to him in the refectory , all the while inwardly leering at Amy , hot with cowardly desire , not manly enough to do anything except play with stolen panties ? Which was the pervert ? Or was there more than one ? " It does n't seem fair , " Amy said . " He would n't say that was the reason he was going to let me go , but I know it must be . He just told me to rinse out my underthings in my cell and not put them on the line . " " Who do you think it is ? " he asked . Amy shrugged . " I do n't know . What does it matter , if the only thing St. Ed is going to do about it is get rid of me ? " " But you 're not sure that 's the reason . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . But if he does n't do something about whoever 's taking my underpants , then I do n't want to stay around here . " " 1 do n't either , " he said , speaking before he realized what he 'd  | said . He feared losing her at the same time he feared losing himself by running away with her . Something has to happen , he thought . He remembered those high school girls he 'd curled up with in the back seats of cars while parked at drive-in movies or along dark levees of irrigation canals . As he 'd fumbled among skirts and sweaters , knowing he was a slave to something other than his own will , he often felt relieved when they diverted his hands from touching anything serious . Still , he drew solace from another mouth attached to his . Why did he need to be with them so much ? It was the same with Amy . He felt caught between impossible desires . When he 'd lusted after her , he realized that the demon grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now that he was unable to say he wanted to leave with her ? just as he 'd avoided going all the way with those girls in back seats ? the demon grinning over his shoulder was Fear of Life . Something has to happen , he thought . Sweat spread over his skin like warm oil as he put his arm around her shoulders . He felt that the effort it took to lift his arm could 've moved a house . Amy leaned her head against his chest . His arm weighed a ton . Perspiration rolled down his neck . His breathing became quick and shallow . He felt enclosed in a small space where the temperature kept going up . His scalp prickled ; his legs grew hotter . He remembered St. Antony , beset by devils while one demon fed the fires of his lust with a bellows , the flames rising from his feet to his loins . He did n't care . Amy put her hand on his knee . He let his burning hand slide down the side of her khaki shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cupped his hand . Through the cotton shirt and thin bra , her nipple poked his damp palm like a button . His groin was aching for her touch . He wanted to take her somewhere else , up to Sun Cave , where they could be alone . " Let 's ... , " he stammered . She shifted and took his hand from her breast and put it on his knee , patting it for a moment , as if signaling it like a small pet to stay still . She looked up , shook her head no . She patted his hand again and then covered it with her palm . " Amy ... , " he said . " No , " she said , " we must n't . Not now . We had our chance . " " I do n't understand , " he said . " I never would 've thought ... "  | She smiled at him . " I want to be a monk , " she said . His eyes burned as her face swam out of focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he could just die . " It 's not your fault , " she said . " I would 've slept with you before ? all you had to say was you wanted me . I wanted you so much . That 's part of the reason I wanted to stay here . To be with you . But now things are different . I still want you , but I want all of you . I want your love . " She had been seeing St. Ed , she said , for counseling , and she realized she had to make a choice , either to play by the rules or to go somewhere else . There was no point in wanting to change her life without changing her ways . No one was making her stay at the hermitage . It happened one day , she said , after they 'd been singing together in chapel ; when she went outside , she had felt such an intense love for everyone , and for everything around her , like nothing she 'd known before . The desert itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bond to the others in their blue cowls , struggling to live decently ; they were all one , she felt , bound by love , in love with the world , with life , with everything . She knew that this was the intensity of love that saints must know all the time . No wonder it grieves them when others sin against the vision of such love . " It was only for a few moments , " Amy said , " but I can remember how I felt . I know now that 's the feeling I want to live for . " For the rest of the afternoon , he worked in a fury . At one point he held up the whole weight of the movable wall , resting against his shoulder , as he banged with his hammer . When he lowered the wall his shoulder was numb . Amy offered to rub it , but he said no ; it was all right . He still felt saddened and soiled for what he 'd done . Then it was time for vespers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . In a way , he was so happy . Freed from bondage to sex , they now could share the love that transcended the flesh . But why had n't he stopped himself before he 'd touched her ? Bernard had thrown himself into a half-frozen pond . Thomas Aquinas drove a sexy maiden out of his bedroom with a brand from the lire . But he had done nothing of the sort . He 'd not only been assailed by temptation , he 'd succumbed . If Amy had n't  | stopped him , what might 've happened ? And then what would 've happened after that ? And after that ? He 'd end up just another dull , undistinguished married lout on the road to his grave . He knew what Amy was talking about when she described her feelings of love . He 'd previously known that sense of passionate fullness , that compassion for all his fellow beings on the planet , whether human or nonhuman . It was such burning love , intensely experienced , persistently coming as a gift , that explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shedding of worldly habits . Who else could kiss a beggar or live on a stone ? Their compassion broke through the walls of time to embrace the living and the dead . Who in the history of life had experienced greater passion than St. Francis of Assisi and St. Clare , who together in spiritual elopement renounced the world 's baubles to embrace their brothers and sisters , the birds and the stars , the earth and the moon ? But for days , weeks now , he 'd exchanged that rich unbounded love for the narrow , crimped one of genital desire . He 'd lost faith in spiritual joy . His vision had constricted to a naked body on a log . Dark thoughts pushed into his mind like clouds . He 'd let himself be taken up to the edge of the abyss for her , and she 'd just slapped him back , denying him even the fleeting illusion of pleasure , the solace of a panting breast , the comfort of wiggling hips . Demons of regret plagued him . He 'd had his chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She was the one who had crawled into his bed , stretched her hot little body over his , fingered his balls and cock , panted in his ear . Now she was saying hands off ! The little princess ! St. Amy the Virgin Twat ! She 'd led him down the brimstone path and left him dangling on the edge of the precipice. iAdios , amigo ! iQue le vaya bien ! He 'd exchanged his vows as a monk for the vanished pleasure of a night he could hardly recall . Who the hell did she think she was ? In front of Sun Cave in the blazing noonday sun he imagined himself pulling her blouse into shreds , her small firm breasts popping brightly into view , pushing her into the hot sand , and struggling to peel her tight jeans down her legs , her exposed thighs brilliant in the sunlight , then the shock of her nakedness , her damp , warm body squirming under him , as she hissed in his  | ear . In his mind she was wild with desire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach , between his legs , its fluttering tip flicking itself into soft crevices and folds of flesh , revitalizing his desire . He plunged himself again into the wet darkness opening up to him , parting the petals of her love , emitting the warm musky aroma of her desire . He could n't believe his thoughts . He crawled onto his knees and pushed his face into his cot . Daddy , he prayed , oh , Daddy , Daddy , help me ! He thought of his father in heaven , faceless , turning away from him . He knelt on the stone floor of his cell , all alone . His worst night of temptation dragged into dawn .  | Exorcism There was a certain brother who was earnest and eager to lead a good life . But being sorely harassed by the demon of lust , he went to a certain old monk and told him of his imaginings . On hearing of these lustful desires ? himself being free of them ? the old man was wroth , declaring that the brother was vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting such thoughts into his mind . The young brother fell into despair . He abandoned his monk 's cell and took the road back into the world . But by the providence of God , Abba Apollo met him on the road and asked , " My son , why are you so sad ? " At first the young brother , in the shame of his soul , could answer nothing , but after Abba Apollo probed further into what had happened , the young man confessed , " Thoughts of lust torment me , and I confided in this old man who said there is now no hope of salvation for me . In despair of myself , I 'm going back into the world . " When Abba Apollo heard this , like a wise physician he counseled the young man , and asked many questions , saying , " Do n't think it 's strange , my son , and do n't despair . For I myself , at my age , and in this way of life , am terribly harried by just such thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the remedy is not so  | much in man 's anxious thought as in God 's compassion . Today , at least , do what I ask of you , and go back to your cell . " The brother did so , and Abba Apollo made his way to the cell of the old monk who had brought him to despair . Standing outside the old man 's cell , Abba Apollo wept and entreated God , " Lord , who sends temptation when it 's needed , let this old man experience the same battle that young brother suffers , so that he may learn by experience in his old age what length of time has never taught him : to have compassion on those harassed by temptation . " When his prayer ended , he saw a demon standing close to the cell shooting arrows at the old monk , and the old man staggered back and forth like someone drunk with wine , until he could endure it no more . He came out of his cell and went down that same road the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abba Apollo went to meet him , and asked , " Where are you going ? What 's the cause of your troubles ? " The old man , sensing the holy man knew what had befallen him , could not speak for shame . Then Abba Apollo said , " Go back to your cell and recognize your weakness : for the devil either has forgotten you until this moment or was contemptuous of you for not being worthy , like men of valor , to do battle with the enemy . Battle , did I say ? ? you could n't stand up to his attack for one day . Because when that young man , engaged with our common adversary , came to you , instead of anointing him with words of comfort for the struggle , you sent him to desperation , forgetting the wise counsel that bids us to redeem those who are fulling and to deliver those who are drawn down to death . You gave  | not a thought to the parable of Our Saviour when He said , The bruised reed thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For no one can endure the assaults of the adversary , neither can they extinguish nor restrain the fire that leaps in our nature , unless God 's grace gives its strength to human weakness . In this salutary judgment upon us , let 's pray to God with all supplication that He will turn aside this scourge that has befallen you , for it is He who maketh sore and bindeth up , He woundeth and His hands make whole , He bringeth low and lifteth up , He killeth and maketh alive , He bringeth down to hell and bringeth back . " So speaking , Abba Apollo made his prayer , and the old man was freed from the warfare engulfing him . Abba Apollo counseled him to ask God for the tongue of the wise that he might know when it was time to speak . ? From Sayings of the Fathers in the Verba Seniorum , translated from the Greek by Pelagius the Deacon , ca . A.D. 390 In the morning , Brother S could n't look at his exhausted face in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . He could n't lift his right arm up to his face to finish shaving without grasping it around the wrist with his left hand . He ate with his left hand and kept his right in his lap . His arm continued to weaken until it dangled virtually useless by his side . He said nothing about it to anybody , trying to do all his work ? hammering , sawing ? left-handed , but the others noticed , and that afternoon when he was grasping his bad arm by the wrist , St. Ed asked him what was wrong . " Probably just a pinched nerve , " he said . " It 'll get better . " But it did n't get better , and during the last week in July , right  | before the Feast of the Transfiguration , St. Ed called a doctor in Tonopah who recommended a neurologist in Las Vegas . St. Ed then worried that Brother S had suffered some nerve damage when Jerry had beaten him up and they 'd waited too long to call a doctor . Amy reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movable solar wall . He agreed with Amy that he 'd probably pressed a nerve on that day ? he remembered how he 'd once hurt his neck in high school playing football and the same thing had happened , but only for a couple of days . Pete disagreed with everyone . " It 's all in his mind , " he said one night . " He 's doing it to his own self . " Privately , Brother S knew he was being punished ; it was the arm that had gone around Amy 's shoulder , the hand that had touched her breast . But whether God or the Evil One was torturing him , he did n't know . It really did n't matter whether it was one or the other . It did n't seem to make any difference what name you called the Tormenter . He and St. Ed drove to Las Vegas the week before the Feast of the Transfiguration . " It 's funny how these things happen , " St. Ed said . " Just when life begins to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a goal , and things seem to be developing in a sensible way , bang ! something like this , out of the blue , knocks everything out of kilter . It makes you wonder . " Brother S knew St. Ed was thinking of Brother Luke . In Las Vegas , St. Ed remained in the doctor 's waiting room while Brother S went in to meet Dr. Pinsky , the neurologist , a small , high-strung man in Calvin Klein jeans and a bright flowered shirt with a spread collar . The doctor 's blond Prince Valiant haircut , hugging his pixie face like a helmet , made him appear younger than Brother S had expected , especially for a doctor . He looked as though he 'd just come in from the golf course . " What have we here ? " Dr. Pinsky asked . Brother S had stripped to his shorts and sat on the edge of the doctor 's table . A sheet of white paper stuck beneath his sweating thighs . Dr. Pinsky tapped a rubber hammer up and down his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trapezius , " he said , his smile on automatic pilot . " We 'll have to send you to the hospital for a CAT scan , but first we 'll do an FMG . We will have to determine what vitality of neurological response we have here . "  | Dr. Pinsky swept his arm toward the machines near the far wall . No one else was in the room . " Follow us , please , " he said , turning toward the machines . He strapped metal electrodes to Brother S 's skin and stuck needles into his muscles . His hand jumped , his arm twitched , his shoulder jerked . Dr. Pinsky switched all the needles and wires to his good arm to make a comparative analysis . With each jolt of electricity Dr. Pinsky called out numbers to a young nurse , wearing a pink smock and white stretch pants as snug as ski pants , who dutifully jotted down the figures . " We 've got all the data , " Dr. Pinsky announced profoundly after completing the electromiogram . " Your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told St. Ed that he 'd make arrangements at the hospital for a CAT scan . " If you 'll give us a phone number , we 'll call you as soon as we have the results . " He said the first thing they had to check was the possibility of a brain tumor . " Then we can go from there . " St. Ed looked shocked as he listened to Dr. Pinsky . The alarmed expression remained after the receptionist called the doctor to the phone . Apparently , the hospital had said they were so backed up they could not accommodate a CAT scan for Brother S until the next day . " What are they talking about ? " Dr. Pinsky said . He began jabbing his finger at the receptionist , who covered the mouthpiece with her hand . " You tell them we have a man in paralysis here . This is an emergency and we want this man tested this evening . " Dr. Pinsky turned and smiled at the monks . On the way to the hospital , St. Ed said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the doctor who misdiagnosed Brother Luke 's condition when I brought him to the emergency room . His name did n't ring a bell until I saw his face . He said Brother Luke had some rare virus affecting his nervous system . They put him into quarantine , and it was n't until twenty-four hours later that they came up with the right diagnosis . I think we should try to find somebody else . " While St. Ed went to get a motel room and to call the doctor in Tonopah for the name of another neurologist , Brother S sat in a small room in the nuclear medicine wing of the hospital awaiting his turn for a CAT scan . Five other people were ahead of him , but  | no one said call another person out of the room . Finally , he was alone , the last to be called . He felt an unexpected peacefulness as he waited for his test . He imagined a tumor swelling in his brain , preparing to kill him . It was almost a relief to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feverish imaginings . He did n't want to die , but if he had to die , so be it . Death , at the moment , did n't seem all that bad . Strapped onto a table with what felt like small sandbags pressed against his head to prevent movement , he stared at the ceiling . Only he and a young nurse were in this quiet room . She said virtually nothing to him as she prepared him for the test . It was evening , he knew ; most of the bustle of the hospital was settling into the routine of the night shift . He heard a click and hum of machinery as the table began to move . Out of the corner of his eye he watched the nurse sit down , glance at her watch , then up at the wall ; she seemed bored as he began to slide into a huge cylinder . Her shift would probably end as soon as she was through with him . He sensed she must be thinking of her evening plans ? a pizza with friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plants ? a movie and a night in bed with a lover ? The huge cylinder hummed and rotated as it zapped him with x-rays , flooding his skull with radiation , scanning his lobes from all angles , forming a composite picture of all the folds in his brain . St. Ed picked him up and took him to a small motel north of the Strip . He said the doctor in Tonopah had reluctantly given him the name of another neurologist after assuring St. Ed that I ) r . Pinsky , although superficially eccentric , was as good as they cane . " Brother S could n't be in better hands , " the doctor had told St. Ed . When St. Ed described Dr. Pinsky 's misdiagnosis of Brother Luke , the Tonopah doctor said , " Brother Luke was a dead nun when he walked into that hospital . Dr. Pinsky proceeded properly . " " ' They 're t hick as thieves , " St. Ed told Brother S. He 'd gone ahead and called another neurologist , explained the situation to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The motel phone rang . St. Ed answered it . " Here , " he said , handing the phone to Brother S. " It 's Pinsky . He says he wants to talk to you , not me . " Dr. Pinsky 's voice was angry . " What 's the idea of trying to bring in another neurologist behind our back ? What kind of sneaky game are you up to anyway ? " Brother S did n't know what to say . " You 'd better talk to Father Arrizabalaga , " he said . " We do n't want to talk to him , " Dr. Pinsky said . " He 's not our patient , you are . You 'd better decide whether you 're going to stay our patient . If we have to perform invasive tests , we ca n't have someone distrust us . " Brother S felt embarrassed . Obviously , either the Tonopah doctor or the second neurologist had called Dr. Pinsky . St. Ed was right ; they were thick as thieves . He felt betrayed . How could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did or who did it ? Everything was out of his hands anyway . " We 're not going to take the rap for that Brother Luke , " Dr. Pinsky continued . " We ca n't perform miracles . We ca n't prevent death when it 's inevitable . " " I believe that , " Brother S said , thinking now that perhaps his own death was more imminent than he wished . " So what do you want to do ? " " I just want it over with , " Brother S said . " You can do what you need to do . " " And you 're going to have confidence in what we do ? " " Yes , " Brother S said , just wanting this conversation to end . " Okay , " Dr. Pinsky said . " We 've looked at your pictures and there 're no lesions that we can see . Of course we have to wait for the radiologist 's report to be sure , but we 've seen thousands of these pictures , and we 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your head 's clean . There 's no fungus growing on your brain . So now we go to step two . Be in the hospital at eight tomorrow morning for a lumbar . Do n't eat or drink anything between now and the test . Be ready to stay overnight in the hospital . " The next morning Brother S found himself naked under a loose blue smock that tied at the back while Dr. Pinsky , dressed for surgery , with the help of a male radiological technician probed his vertebrae to effect a spinal tap for a myelograph . It took three  | stabs before the needle popped through the fascia at the base of his spine . Perspiration prickled all over his face . He went suddenly weak , as if his energy had rushed like a fluid from his body through the hole in his spine . A nurse held a curved silver receptacle next to his mouth , but he did n't get sick . He felt the pressure of the dye flowing from the tube into his spinal column . He understood why Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face down on a tilting x-ray table , he had to lie with his chin propped up on a sandbag , his head tilted awkwardly backward , crimping his neck so the barium-heavy dye would n't leak into his brain . He heard a machine hum as the table tipped forward until he was upside down . An x-ray machine moved along his spine , zapping picture after picture . His neck ached . Dr. Pinsky positioned a fluoroscope against his neck . The machine hummed again and again as Dr. Pinsky , wearing special glasses and big elbow-length gloves , repeatedly clicked the fluoroscope , illuminating vertebrae and ganglia . With each click of the machine Brother S knew his neck was becoming more and more radioactive . Dr. Pinsky was breathing heavily . " Damn , " he said at one point . Again the machine flashed . " We better stop , " the technician said . The machine flashed again . " We do n't want a burn , " the technician said . Again the machine hummed , and Dr. Pinsky pulled away . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see it better in the x-rays . I 'm sure that 's where we 'll need to operate . " Brother S spent the night on his back in the hospital bed . In the strange darkness a curtain separated him from a young man in a body cast who 'd fallen out of a third-story window during a party . The boy kept moaning through the night , " Oh shit , oh fuck , " as if in prayer . Brother S had been warned that he might have excruciating headaches from the lumbar , but he felt fine . Throughout the night nurses periodically took his temperature and checked his pulse . The rest of the time he lay peacefully , able to see everything in the dark room without any observable source of light . ' The night became timeless . He felt at ease , neither happy nor sad , free of emotion , transferred into a state of limbo . The next morning as he awaited news of his tests , he learned that St. Ed , after visiting him at dinnertime , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had acute cholecystitis . He was taken into emergency surgery . Doctors surmised  | he must 've been in excruciating pain , because the inflamed gallbladder was the size of a lemon . But the operation was successful , and he was now resting peacefully in another wing of the hospital . He would be released in two or three days . Brother S felt lost and confused , as on that day when he 'd knelt with Sister Alphonsus at his grammar school praying for his dead father . He could n't understand why he felt this way . St. Ed was going to be all right . The surgery was successful ; he was alive . But he still felt helpless as a child . Too many unexpected things were happening . One minute he and St. Ed were talking in a motel room , and the next he was in the hospital , on the verge of an operation , while St. Ed was being cut open . A heavy sadness settled over him . He wanted to visit St. Ed , but the nurses told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In late morning Dr. Pinsky arrived wearing his designer jeans and thin gold chains around his neck . Dr. Held , a neurosurgeon , dressed in gray slacks and a blue blazer , accompanied him . Dr. Pinsky explained that he 'd invited Dr. Held to serve as a consultant because the x-rays had n't conclusively revealed what the problem was . There was probably something on that nerve in the fifth cervicle , but further tests were necessary which only a neurosurgeon was qualified to perform . Dr. Held indicated that he wanted to inject the contrasting dye directly into Brother S 's neck and take more x-rays . As if illustrating the procedure , he held his hand to his own neck , like a cocked gun , his index finger pointed just below the ear as he slowly lowered his thumb . If the tests showed what he expected , then - with Brother S 's permission - he would operate . Alone in his portion of the partitioned room , Brother S felt his eyes burn . He did n't want any more tests . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pricked , probed , and burned with radiation for two days now and nobody knew any more than when they 'd started . He 'd agreed to go through the tests hoping something concrete would turn up , something manageable through an operation ; then his paralysis would be gone , his arm healed . But the tests had turned up nothing . His body was flooded with radiation until his bones glowed , but the doctors knew no more than he did - less , in fact , because now he knew  | what he 'd feared . He was being punished with something seriously incurable , unknown to medical science . He would soon be beyond help , like Brother Luke or one of the thousands each year left to face death without hope except for some desperate solace that might be sought in a Mexican clinic or a trip to Lourdes . A fearful , icy sensation spread under his rib cage and would not leave . When he was released from his room , he found St. Ed sitting up in bed , his glasses low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine . A news program was on TV , but the sound was off St. Ed 's recuperation was so remarkable the doctors thought he might be released by the next evening , two days before the Feast of the Transfiguration . " No way I was going to let this butcher shop foul up our celebration , " he told Brother S , looking at him over his glasses . " Have you invited your nurses to come ? " When Brother S told him of the additional tests he needed and his wish to postpone them , St. Ed arranged with Dr. Held to wait until after the Feast of the Transfiguration , which the neurosurgeon found perfectly acceptable ? he did n't share Dr. Pinsky 's sense of urgency ? and Brother S would have time to prepare himself . " If you do n't want that needle in your neck next week , " St. Ed told Brother S , " you 've got about four days to get better . " St. Ed clicked the TV control by his bed and the sound came up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Max Frishenheimer , was speaking to reporters . He held a chunk of calcium carbonate from Shoshone Mountain . " These mineral deposits show that hot groundwater once welled up through Shoshone Mountain . An earthquake could make it happen again . Flooding would cause canisters to crack and spew radioactivity into the environment . It would be an unspeakable calamity . It could blow the top off that mountain . It could destroy the biosphere . If you want to envision the end oft he world , that 's it . I 'm pronuclear , but I 'm also a scientist and a public servant . Shoshone Mountain is the last place high-level nuclear waste should be buried . It must be stopped . " St. Ed clapped his hands . " We 're going to win , " he said . " We 're going to heat those devils . " It was evening when a nurse brought St. Ed out of the hospital  | in a wheelchair . Brother S had spent the previous night alone in the motel . Although he could n't raise his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength in his wrist and forearm , once he got his hand situated on the nob of the gear shift . He steered with his left hand as they drove out of Las Vegas into the desert . St. Ed lounged on the passenger side , propped up on pillows that Brother S had picked up at KMart . " What 's this ? " St. Ed asked as he fiddled with the radio dial . A woman 's voice , growing louder and clearer , worked its way through the static . It was Peggy Lee singing " Fever . " Shadowy outlines of yucca plants and dark Joshua trees sped past in the deepening night . Never know how much I love you Never know how much I care When you put your arms around me I get a fever that 's so hard to bear ? You give me fever St. Ed hummed along with Peggy Lee , huskily repeating occasional words . The song seemed to go on and on . Brother S felt nervous . It was as if St. Ed was playing the song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been plaguing him for weeks . It was as if he knew what lay festering in his soul . Was he making fun of him ? He seemed so mockingly high-spirited as he hummed and sang : You give me fever When you kiss me Fever when you hold me tight Fever ! ? in the morning Fever all through the night Brother S could n't stand it . He realized he could no longer hold his secret within ; he had to confess . Shame was what he now felt instead of desire . All his sharp longing for Amy had vanished since he 'd entered the hospital , replaced by sadness and remorse for that night she 'd crawled into his bed . How could he have so willingly wished to sacrifice eternity for further nights with her ? " Fever ! " St. Ed howled , his head jerking rhythmically , eyes squeezed shut , his open palms and fingers slapping the dashboard  | as though it were a conga drum . His accompaniment to Peggy Lee evolved into some sort of weird scat singing of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the morning ! You give me fever ! Sha-BOOM ! Fever ! All through the night ! " Sweat rolled down Brother S 's face . What was he going to say ? When the song on the radio ended , St. Ed continued his own version in a whispery whistle , his hand softly tapping the dashboard . With a hard slap of his palm on his knee , he concluded his whistling . " Great song , " he said , " very satisfying . " When Brother S tried to speak , it seemed as though something hard in his throat , like a chunk of apple , made him squawk . " Awwk , " he said . " Are you all right ? " St. Ed asked . He nodded , and St. Ed said , " I can still remember the first time I listened to that song . I do n't mean the first time I heard it , but the first time I really listened to it . " It was when he was a kid in Boy Scouts , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth grade . He and five or six other boys were trying to earn merit badges in electricity and radio . Every Wednesday evening during the summer they received instruction from one boy 's father , Mr. Eccles , a tall , gawky man with Coke-bottle glasses who worked for the electric company . One night Mr. Eccles asked the boys , " What is electricity ? " No one knew . When the man answered himself , " Electricity is power , " Ed felt vaguely unsatisfied . He still did n't think he knew what electricity really was . He pushed the man for a better answer . " There is no better answer , " the man said . " Does ' the movement of electrons ' tell you anything more ? Electricity is a kind of power , energy . Even scientists do n't know any more than that . They just make you think they do . " That night as the boys were fiddling with their amateur radio kits , one ofthem ? not Ed , who had little dexterity with the equipment ? completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside world . It seemed like a miracle . What a couple of ' weeks before had consisted of a pile of screws , tubes , wires , and scraps of metal now hummed , buzzed , and spoke ? no , sang , rather , because the first sounds the boys conjured into the room after weeks of ' laboring like mad scientists in the basement was the voice of Peggy Lee singing " Fever . "  | " Listen to this , " Mr. Eccles ordered the boys . He turned up the radio . He hummed along with Peggy Lee . St. Ed could n't believe how this song transformed the man . He closed his eyes , snapped his fingers , swayed to the music . He 'd never seen an adult affected that way by pop music . On that summer night in Mr. Eccles 's hot basement they all huddled around this makeshift radio and listened intently to Peggy Lee . " Now that , " Mr. Eccles said , " is power , " and St. Ed , as a boy , understood what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charge Peggy Lee could give you . They had learned all about electrical charges , how rubbing certain materials such as glass gave them a positive charge , while others , such as plastic , got a negative charge when rubbed . The boys knew what kind of charge their dongs got when rubbed . " I later saw Peggy Lee perform in a hotel lounge in a small town , " St. Ed told Brother S , " when I was in college . At first I was disappointed . She was more fleshy and pale than I 'd expected her to be . " She introduced her bass player in a breathy voice as a man who had the biggest instrument she 'd ever seen . The audience tittered . The discrepancy between her vulgarity and his memory of her exquisite song disturbed him . But when she sang " Fever , " he closed his eyes , and he was once again a child in Mr. Eccles 's basement , learning about electricity , energy , and power . Brother S had n't seen St. Ed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be relief from the operation , he figured , that had triggered his reveries . But St. Ed 's stories usually had a point . As they drove past the turnoff to Mercury , the tower lights of the Nuclear Test Site blazing in the distance , he wondered if his abbot was still trying to help him unveil his soul . The power of Amy and and the power of Peggy Lee seemed so different , yet at bottom they both had something to do with sex . On the radio Bob Dylan was singing , " Lay , lady , lay , lay across my big brass bed . " St. Ed sighed . " It 's amazing how explicit these songs are if you listen to them . I bet it 's even more so with today 's new songs . In the old days veiled songs used to really get people 's hearts pumping . Today people listen to explicit lyrics and do n't even feel a rise in temperature . The old deadly sin of lust is n't so deadly anymore . "  | Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Under his shirt , trickles of sweat rolled from his armpits , tickling the skin over the sides of his ribs , as he told St. Ed of his previous weeks ' torments . He told him of the visions of lust assailing him at night , the unbearable desires plaguing him during the day . He told him of that day he 'd seen Amy stretched out naked on the log in the juniper grove , the night she 'd crawled into his bed , and the day he 'd put his arm around her shoulder , reached for her breast . The confession rushed from his lungs , hot , furious , tortured . He spoke like a man possessed , his tongue moving to a will other than his own . He could n't stop . The windshield became a blur of yellow light . He felt legions of invisible demons swirling around his head in a panic , trying to regain the control they were rapidly losing . He turned to see St. Ed gazing gently at him , his hand reaching toward him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patting him comfortingly on his paralyzed shoulder . " We all have our temptations and sins . Just remember what Abba Pastor told the young monk , ' Do n't be sad , my brother , just try to do better next time . ' " With St. Ed 's comforting touch on his shoulder , a wave of warmth passed through him . He slowed the truck and pulled to the side of the road . He could no longer see through the windshield . His hand twitched on the steering wheel . His jaw quivered . He felt spent , exhausted , like a drowning man pulled from a lake . A peaceful tiredness embraced him . A thousand shouting voices that had dinned for weeks in his ears were gone . There 's no one else here , he told himself , as if the fact surprised him : only he and St. Ed sat in the cab of the truck with the radio softly playing by the side of a desert road . Only the two ofus are here , he repeated . It seemed so peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless truck with this other person . Something had been Idled from him . Why had he waited so long ? " Do you want me to drive ? " St. Ed asked . He shook his head . " I 'm all right , " he said . " I can drive now . " Back on the road to Warm Springs , St. Ed remained relaxed and talkative . Brother S listened with a sense of peacefulness , a residue of calm . " Every age has its predominant temptations , " St. Ed was saying . " Oh , I do n't mean that the old Seven Deadly Sins are n't still with  | us . All you have to do is to look at what keeps that Nuclear Test Site expanding to know that greed is still alive and well in America . It 's greed and pride that 've made Shoshone Mountain necessary . " But demons vary in every age , St. Ed went on to say . Lust was different when those demons tortured St. Antony in the Egyptian desert . Lust then was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroded people 's spirits . Many people today had nothing else except sex to deal with their fear of death . Or boredom . Lust arising from boredom was a far worse sin because it was an expression of accidie , the worst of all sins . " When one of the desert fathers asked the devil which of the Seven Deadly Sins ? pride , envy , greed , gluttony , anger , lust , or accidie ? sent more people to Hell , Satan answered without hesitation , accidie , ' and its offshoots of boredom , indifference , and alienation . It 's still true today . " Brother S recalled the hours he 'd sat with his back to a cell and stared out over the desert , devoid of energy , wishing to be somewhere other than where he was , not caring about anything . At that time , if he was in the throes of accidie , he did n't know it ; or at least he did n't realize it . Was lack of awareness what made the sin so sinister ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Amy ? It seemed St. Ed was missing the point of what really tormented him . " It 's not the temptations of lust that bother me now , " Brother S said . " It 's what actually happened with Amy . I 'm so ashamed . " A little girl 's voice on the radio was singing about a boyfriend whose name was Lollipop . St. Ed lowered the sound . " I do n't like this song too much , " he said . " I remember when she sang that song at the World 's Fair in New York in 1964 . That was a bad time for me . I was going through a lot of the troubles you 're having . " He adjusted a pillow behind his head . The smell of juniper and pinon came through the dark window as they passed Tonopah , heading east . " Have you examined the statistics of your so-called sin ? " St. Ed asked . " There are approximately six billion people in the world right now ? that 's six billion fucks right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to estimate the total number of fucks that have occurred , but when you start multiplying a daily average times  | ten thousand years we 're talking about a number so astronomical it staggers the human mind . Do you think one more little fuck is going to upset God ? Do you think He said , ' Oh , oh , something 's happening down there that I have n't seen before ? ' " He reached down and turned up the radio . " Now here 's tran-scendence , " he said . It was the Flamingos singing , " I Only Have Eyes for You . " " Sublime , " St. Ed said , " just sublime . " " But we did n't fuck , " Brother S said , surprising himself . Despite St. Ed 's loose tongue , he 'd avoided using such vulgar language for the past ten years . It was a sign that he was becoming a different person from the one he wished to be . That was the elusive point he wanted to get across to his confessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem ? " St. Ed asked . " We all have thoughts , murderous intentions , lascivious desires . It 's what you do that counts . Leave the judging of intentions and wishes to God . " " But after we were in bed together , I wanted to leave the hermitage with her . I was willing to give up my life as a monk . " " Now that 's a horse of a different color , " St. Ed said . " Do you feel that way now ? " " No , but it might be hard not to when I 'm around her . " St. Ed nodded . " She 's a temptress to others as well . " He said that as much as he liked Amy and thought she would make a fantastic monk , he knew the distractions of human nature . Most of the early double monasteries solved their problem by keeping men and women segregated except for liturgical prayer . He became more keenly aware of difficulties at the hermitage when he learned that Pete had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a force just came over him ; the panties made him think of his dear dead wife or something . Pete was very open about it - he did n't reveal his act in confession , so conveying this Information to Brother S was not a breach of confidence . Pete was willing to return the panties and apologize to Amy , but St. Ed did n't want to take the chance of Amy harboring resentment and continuing suspicion against Pete . " Amy told me someone took two pair ofunderpants , " Brother S said . " I took the other pair , " St. Ed said . He wanted Amy to come  | forward , he said , and he thought if the event happened again , she would . He wanted to discuss the matter with her , but if he broached the subject , it would reveal that he knew who the culprit was . His plan worked . He was able to discuss the matter of the stolen panties without revealing Pete 's culpability or his own complicity . " She impressed me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hermitage , especially as it grows , will breed continual problems . It 's hard enough to deal with the specter of homosexuality without adding the complications of heterosexuality . " He reminded Brother S of the warning offered by St. John of the Cross : " Between a holy man and a holy woman there should be a foot-thick brick wall ! " On the other hand , he pointed out , some of the greatest saints in the world have been men and women who lived in a kind of spiritual marriage , like John of the Cross himself and Teresa of Avila , or Francis and Clare of Assisi . " Do not believe that I do not love her with a perfect love , " St. Francis had said of St. Clare . Brother S knew the story well : how Francis and Clare had met clandestinely in Assisi for a year before their spiritual elopement ; how Clare had sneaked out of her parents ' house one night bedecked in jewels , a bridal dress and veil ; how Francis met her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , cut her hair , and dressed her in drab rough robes like his own . " I guess that was only possible in another age , " St. Ed said . " But it 's such a beautiful moment , Francis cutting her hair , making her a friar like himself " Brother S noticed in the shadows that he had that same dreamy expression he 'd earlier exhibited when looking at Amy in the hermitage chapel . Was this man secretly in love ? " But it 's complicated by Amy being a gymnomaniac . " " A what ? " " A gymnomaniac . She apparently ca n't keep her clothes on . I stumbled across her last week halfway up the hill to Sun Cave , stretched out naked as a jaybird , just the way you saw her . I did n't recognize her at first . You ca n't always tell how people are going to look without clothes . Some people look great , others look lousy . I myself for instance , look better in clothes . " Brother S remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body slide into the steaming water at Straightgut 's . With his long hair and bushy beard , he looked like a swimming bear ; even the tops of his shoulders were matted with dark , wet hair . " Amy 's one of those people who definitely look better without clothes . With her tan , " St. Ed continued , " she does n't even really look naked . She looks , well , natural . But how are we going to have someone like her around ? " As they pulled into Warm Springs , Mickey and Sylvia were singing something on the radio about mountains so high and valleys so deep that they could n't get across to the other side . " Now there 's a duet you and Amy could sing beautifully , " he said . " She would make such a wonderful monk . " They spent the night in Warm Springs , since St. Ed wanted to check the mail in the morning and make some calls about the Feast of the Transfiguration . He lay on the couch ? he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? while Brother S walked to the grocery store where the postal boxes were kept . The box was crammed with mail , and when Brother S returned to the trailer , letters and cards spilled from his arms onto the floor . Notes from all over southern Nevada , and even farther , came from people who had seen the Nathan Spock TV show . One couple from Twin Falls , Idaho , had gotten a video of the show and wanted to come down for the festivities . " Look at this , " St. Ed said , holding up a money order . " It 's for a thousand dollars . " The anonymous money order came wrapped In hotel stationery and an envelope from Caesars Palace . Someone had scrawled " Keep up the good work " on the stationery but had n't signed his or her name . " Look at these letters , " St. Ed said . " If everyone who says they want to come shows up at the celebration , we 're going to have ammo . " Hle told Brother S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's show had been a fiasco , a complete failure , and yet all the time God had apparently been working through him . His mention oft he hermitage 's anniversary celebration had garnered this  | wonderful response . " We 're really just instruments of the Lord , " he said with a big smile . St. Ed hobbled over to the phone where the red light on the answering machine blinked nonstop . He pushed the replay button . The tape was filled with people calling about his TV appearance or with questions about the celebration of the Feast of the Transfiguration . Only Mrs. Scully registered her disgust with what she labeled St. Ed 's dangerous , heretical views . One of the callers was Nathan Spock himself , who wanted to bring a TV crew to the celebration . " I do n't believe this , " St. Ed said . " It 's ordained . " A few letters of disapproval mixed with admiring ones , but the only real bad news was a warrant from the traffic court informing him he 'd missed his scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed said . " I forgot all about those tyrants . I wonder what would happen if I just sent them a check now ? " On the way back to the hermitage , over the last stretch of rough road before climbing into the Kawich Range , Brother S noticed St. Ed wince when the pickup jolted through the dry ruts of a gully wash . St. Ed had said nothing about his operation or Brother S 's arm since leaving the hospital . Brother S asked if he was still in pain . " Pain ? " St. Ed replied . " Of course , there 's pain ; but it 's only physical pain . " He talked of the upcoming celebration and of the necessity to raise a spiritual army to combat the benightedness of ecclesiastical and secular authorities like the bishop and the DOE . " A new kind of war is brewing , " he said . " It 'll be going full blast in the next millennium . That 's what people like Gil Davis at the DOE and the bishop ca n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . What matters is the spiritual ends we overcome our pain to serve . We 're all just here for a moment . The beauty or ugliness we leave behind is what 's important . " Brother S wondered if St. Ed was practicing his sermon for the Feast of the Transfiguration . He remembered the doctors saying St. Ed must 've been in intense pain for some time with a gallbladder so swollen . To Brother S 's knowledge , he 'd never complained . He vowed not to complain either , although he knew his situation was different . The discomfort of his own paralyzed arm persisted ,  | generating not so much physical pain as a continuing fear of the unknown . No relief was in sight . At the hermitage they learned that a man and a woman from the EPA had come out in a white van to inform them of a " little upcoming activity . " A nuclear device of up to i5o kilotons would he detonated underground , weather permitting , on the morning of August sixth . " They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallout , " Pete said , " but Amy ran them off . " " Amy did ? " St. Ed asked . " She stood up to them , " Ralph said . " She made them ske-daddle . " " She said we were n't going to play their games , " Pete added . Brother S saw that St. Ed looked pleased . He walked over to Amy , put his arm around her shoulder , and just stood there grinning . For years he had refused to cooperate with the EPA in its wish that the monks monitor their own well-being . He was glad the EPA was around , but that 's what taxpayers ' dollars paid for . What he resented was the way the DOE and EPA implicated local schoolteachers and ranchers ' housewives in the whole nuclear scheme by getting them to monitor fallout . Soon they became part of the system , assuming officious roles as they checked on their own safety according to little monitoring devices attached to fence posts . Soon they began looking forward to the next test so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been zapped . " So this little woman , " St. Ed announced , his face beaming , his big palm still cupped on Amy 's shoulder , " stood off the United States EPA while the rest of you galoots stood around . " His highspirited grin showed that while he was just teasing Pete and the other men , he was proud as hell of Amy . He then announced to the community that the Feast of the Transfiguration would also 1w the occasion for the first profession of vows for the new members of the community . He wanted each of the prospective monks to spend the night fasting and praying alone in the wilderness . Brother S , as prior of ' the hermitage , would direct each of the postulants to an isolated area in the desert fig a night of solitary  | preparation . He realized he was advancing the schedule for the first profession of vows , but he had observed the postulants and was ready to accept them all as novices . " Amy , too ? " Brother S asked in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brother S. " Shave her head , Brother , " he said , his voice booming . " She can do the job . Amy 's going to be a monk . "  | The Feast of the Transfiguration Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John the brother of James , and led them up a high mountain where they were alone ; and in their presence he was transfigured ? his face shone like the sun , and his clothes became white as the light . ? Matthew 17:1 ? 3 , the gospel read annually at mass on August 6th , the Feast of the Transfiguration . Hiroshima : Monday morning at 8 : i5 , August 6 , 1945 . It was a very fine day . Suddenly like a flashbulb going off , a kind of blue covered the entire city . Smoke and fire twisted as if reaching all the way to heaven . Black rain fell . ? Testimony of Mrs. Fumie Katayama , a Hiroshima hibakusha , in National Geographic , April 1989. 4:00 A.M. The procession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross of the graveyard and followed Brot her S , who carried a torch , up the mountain to Sun Cave . The August night sparkled with falling stars . Stellar constellations of birds - the Swan , the Crow , the Eagle ? flapped peacefully through the sky 's nuclear explosions . After whizzing through outer space  | at the speed of light for the past sixteen hundred years , photons entered St. Ed 's eyes , and he saw their source , the star marking the tail of Cygnus the Swan flying south along the bright stream of the Milky Way . That light had departed from its star when desert fathers still walked among wolves at night on the Egyptian desert . The wonder of it ? the swarming stars of the great Hercules cluster . The great Northern Cross . Galaxies and novae speeding toward and away from him on this dust speck in space , this whirling planet , at astonishing speeds . From nuclear explosions had come the popping atoms in the earth under his feet as well as the blood rushing through his veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the torchlight , climbed the mountain , singing the plainchant of medieval monks in front of Sun Cave . August sixth , the Feast of the Transfiguration ? at last ? and the postulants would make their first profession of vows later that morning , Pete as a lay brother and the rest as choir monks . Each had spent the long night alone in prayer in the desert . Now they coalesced into a worshiping community for the night office of vigils . Outdoor vigils . Outlaw vigils . How he wished the bishop could see this gathering of faith in the modern world . The chancellor had sent a letter reminding St. Ed of the bishop 's command to abandon the hermitage by the fifteenth . He would not go . They would have to drag him out . " Deus in adjutorium intende , " St. Ed chanted . The monks intoned in unison , " Ad adjuvandum me festina . " Dawn whitened the sky . St. Ed 's knees buckled . The earth under his feet wobbled as the mountain heaved . The underground nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun Cave trembled as shock waves from ' so kilotons of nuclear energy made the ground quiver . Driven underground , the mushroom cloud vented its wasteful rage . " We are the restorers of lost religion , " St. Bernard had written about his White Monks . St. Ed felt aligned with Bernard . Faith in sacred time had energized the first Cistercians as well as St. Ed 's own paleolithic precursors in the caves of Altamira seventy thousand years ago . The White Monks became like pre-Aryan Basques in neolithic times , when their highest deity was a goddess and her consort was a snake . Their sacraments and rituals revealed  | divinity to be an explosion of energy giving form to time , matter , and space . He knew he was dangerously close to heresy . He could just see the bishop 's pallid face with his little chin as he argued that the doll-like statues in the cathedral would be better replaced with signs and symbols of ravaging tornados and furious hurricanes . He could n't imagine himself trying to explain to an uncomprehending bishop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncle . " The fiery rim of the sun appeared on the horizon like a loud clang : white dawn , as the Indians called it , metamorphosed into yellow dawn . The fiery nuclear furnace of the sun cleared the eastern rim of the mountains , transfiguring the world from night to brilliant day . Glowing faces , rocks , sagebrush emerged from shadows , newly created . Down from the mountain , the postulants waited in their cells as groaning Ram pickups , Broncos , Cherokees , Navajos , Trailbusters , and other 4 X 4 vehicles jolted through the hermitage gates in swirls of dust . Brother S , as the hermitage prior , directed traffic , with his left arm , to a parking area . By 10 A.M. , guests had filled the chapel . Amy 's parents ? her father a stoic man with a dark , drooping mustache and a straw hat , her mother freckled , gaunt , and tearful ? greeted St. Ed with funereal grief . He knew he was going to have to direct much of his sermon toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan expressions spoke of deep mourning . He was n't surprised . At Spencer Abbey he 'd seen parents almost prostrate in despair at the thought of losing a child to the cloistered life . Bubbly with excitement , Amy 's sister ? her name was Debbie and three of her friends , clanging with jewelry , bobbed toward the chapel . Fountains of thick , curly hair jetted from their heads al odd angles . Debbie had done all the girls ' fingernails with rainbow paints and sequins . She aspired to be a nail artist , she said . St. Ed aborted a gasp as she disappeared through the chapel door in white pants so tight she could hardly bend her knees as she made her way up the steps . Fringe dangled from her white boots . St. Ed stared . How did one manage to get into pants so tight ? " She has to lie on the floor to get them on , " Amy said . " I used to do that myself "  | June and Dawn Mosho arrived with their brother Dale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been going faithfully to Weight Watchers on the reservation and had already slimmed down . He planned to lose ninety pounds . " Dale is on his power road , " June said . " Some people think he 's going too far because he got involved with the peyote people in prison . But he 's just doing what he was called to do . He 's putting up the meeting tonight . " St. Ed had given the Indians permission to have a Half-Moon Way meeting that night after the feast . " Sure , " he 'd replied to their request without hesitation . If they were coming to his ceremony , he would let them have theirs . He was the one who had invited people of all faiths and races to celebrate the anniversary of the hermitage with him . He had welcomed the Shoshone to do what the DOE had forbidden at the sacred burial grounds on the test site . When he 'd previously attended a meeting of the Half-Moon Way , reservation Indians then frowned on the peyote meetings ? they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public image of the Duckwater Tribe and undermine its battles with the BLM and the DOE . " I do n't care anymore , " June Mosho said , " what they think on the reservation . We can not turn away from our sources of power . " A bus carrying protesters evicted from the Peace Camp arrived with a ragtag army of activists ranging from a white-haired man in a blue golfer 's hat and polyester slacks who 'd walked from Santa Barbara to the test site , to a Vietnam vet in camouflage fatigues and a young woman , calling herself Princess Sagebrush , who wore a Oaxacan dress with bright flower embroidery . " Welcome , welcome , " St. Ed greeted each of the guests , shaking hands and eyeing potential postulants . St. Bernard had accepted such diversity to medieval monasticism , and he would too . Superficial differences of worship did n't matter . What mattered was faith in the efficacy of contemplative prayer , belief in the power of the spirit . All were welcome , all were potential monks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him as he waved a Jeep toward a parking place . Brother S 's right arm hung limply by his side , his left listlessly beckoning the world through the hermitage gates .  | To St. Ed , each truck or van bouncing through the gates offered a vote of support for the monastery . It would be difficult for the bishop to ignore him now . Parishioners from Warm Springs arrived , including Mrs. Scully , dressed in a tan pantsuit and safari hat like a woman on a big-game hunt . " I 'm here to keep my eye on you , " she told St. Ed . Succulent smells of cooking meat drifted from the juniper grove where , Pete 's friends had turned a lamb on a spit over a trench of hot coals since before dawn . Long tables and folding chairs , borrowed from the Tonopah parish , waited for the outdoor feast . Brother S pulled the bell rope , clanging all celebrants to the chapel . Overhead the sky grew dirty . Fine yellow sand sifted down . St. Ed rubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . " Fallout ? " Pete asked . St. Ed nodded . The postulants walked from their cells in street clothes , Pete in clean blue Levi 's and a pressed plaid shirt , Amy in a loose white cotton dress . " Wait a minute . Stop . Let us get set up . " Nathan Spock and two kids in yellow KLAV-TV T-shirts rushed forward carrying cameras , tripods , sound booms . " Nathan , you 're a horse 's ass . " " No names , no names . " " Who 're you kidding ? " " I want Las Vegas to see what you 're doing . " " Spare us , Nathan . " I n the chapel , the four postulants - Amy , Pete , Ralph , and Teddy lay face down on the stone floor in front of the altar . St. Ed , in mass vestments of green for the long summer season after Pentecost , raised his arms to the congregation . TV cameras whirred as Nathan directed his underlings with silent hand signals . Late arrivers crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feast of the Transfiguration , " St. Ed 's voice boomed through the chapel . He looked down at the postulants humbly lying on the floor , then gazed at Amy 's parents . " Today , these novice monks will make their first profession of vows . Let them become totally energized . Let them become divinized . For if they 're anything less , they shall regress - or , rather , remain -  | twits and twirps . " He was glad to see smiles appear on some faces . He wanted the day to be lighthearted , happy . After each postulant professed vows , Brother S helped garb them in new clothes , the white robe and black Cistercian scapular and leather belt covered with the large blue cowl . " May the Lord clothe you in a new life , " St. Ed said . The cowl fell over Amy 's plain white street dress ; her head was wreathed with rosebuds and daisies speckled with delicate dots of baby 's breath . Brother S pulled the blue hood over her cropped hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kiss of fellowship . " Baby , " her father croaked , as he reached out to hug her . When Amy gave St. Ed the kiss of fellowship , her lips met him full on the mouth , surprising him with their warmth and softness . Brother S also gave him the kiss of peace with an ardor he had n't experienced before . Brother S pressed his warm , damp cheek against St. Ed 's beard . " Oh , boy , " St. Ed told the congregation . " The sun shines today on a renewed world , a world sanctified . " He delivered a homily on the monastic vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience , not as deprivations , but as gifts that lead into reality , vitality , totality . Through their vows monks would seek to free themselves from selfish worldly desires for wealth , sex , and material power . " Life is not a battle between the spirit and the flesh , " St. Ed said . " It 's un-Christian to think so . Life is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must give up selfishness . While we renounce genitality , we embrace sexuality . We are to be passionate ; we 're to be erotic . Eros , when refined , explodes into unselfish love . " Brother S and Amy , standing side by side , holding the book of music between them , sang the " Magnificat . " Their voices rose with the sweet clouds of incense to the domed ceiling , swelling through the room , out the doors and windows . They sang beautifully . The stone of the chapel walls and floor softened . There was no need again to say what was so evident : There is only one world . Not a profane world over there and a sacred world over here . One world . Filled with energies of life and death . " The choice is simple , " St. Ed told the people after reading the  | Gospel for the Feast of the Transfiguration . " You either have faith in the mushroom cloud or the Cloud of Unknowing . We reject the energy of death and waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just preaching away up here - I 'm talking about the all-consuming energy of love . " Pete played the harmonica - his rendition of " Red River Valley " - as the procession of Blue Monks filed into the bright summer sunlight . Food spread across the tables : bowls of beans , posole , and soup ; salads of all kinds : watercress , romaine , red leaf , pinto bean , tomato , olive , coleslaw , macaroni , and potato in styles American , German , and Basque - Pete had made the Basque potato salad with tiny canned shrimp and hard-boiled eggs . People had been so generous ; there would be leftovers for days . St. Ed insisted that people take home food , especially extra lamb , since the normal fare of the monastery was vegetarian . He 'd gotten into an argument with Brother S about serving meat at the feast but had insisted that the specialness of the day required something extraordinary . He 'd helped Pete slaughter the lamb , smacking it in the forehead with a hammer and cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the death that supplied him with life . It was a sacrifice , like the sacrifices of kings and hull-gods in ancient times . Yes , it was shocking , he told Brother S - his hands and arms spattered with blood - but no more so than Yahweh 's command for the Old Testament prophet to kill his son . Sure , it was cannibalism , but little different from the cannibalism required by the Christian Messiah , whose brutal command to eat his flesh and drink his blood people no longer heard with any force . Brother S finally pitched in - he 'd killed and cut up chickens for St raightgut - but he would n't eat the lamb as platters of barbecued meat passed down the long tables from hand to hand . St raightgut never showed up . St. Ed had made a special trip to the hot springs to persuade him to come to the feast and to donate a rabbit . Straightgut had nodded , saying that maybe he 'd do just that . St. Ed grew expectant . Getting Straightgut out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old hermit from the BLM but also add a lay brother to the ranks - one who knew how to make things grow in the desert . As the hermitage increased , Brother S would need help with the expanding gardens .  | He also wanted Brother S to enlarge his beekeeping operation and his bread making . Straightgut could lend a hand . But the old hermit appeared more fearful than ever . Peering from beneath his pith helmet , he 'd told St. Ed , " I have to watch this place day and night . If they put plutonium in these waters , I 'm a goner . We 're all goners . " He no longer came to the hermitage for Sunday mass as he had in the past . St. Ed felt that once he got Straightgut into the hermitage , once he started working with Brother S on his solar and wind projects and spent a few days with his old friend Pete , he 'd feel at home . He could start leading a normal life around Amy . He 'd get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Ed looked up from his food to see the cyclopian gray eye of a TV camera glaring at him . It transfigured the boy supporting the camera on his shoulder into a robot with a large projecting eye in the center of his metallic head . " Get that damn thing out of here , " St. Ed said . " This is a celebration , a feast , not a movie . " A young woman with a machine strapped to her shoulder flung out her arm with a microphone extending toward St. Ed like something obscene . " Tell her to buzz off , Nathan , " St. Ed said . " You people trivialize everything . " Nathan slid onto the bench next to him . " Me ? " Nathan said . " What real monks would call themselves Blue Monks ' ? " " The Cistercians are real , " St. Ed snapped , " and they call themselves White Monks . " With a wave of his hand , Nathan sent the camera crew to interview the new monks at another table . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He poured wine into a paper cup . " This is going to make a hell of a documentary , " he told St. Ed . " You 're mocking me . " " I 'm all for religion , " Nathan said , " but you 're wasting yourself out here . You 're wasting those two kids , too . They 've got dynamite voices . I could get a producer to have them in a casino show within a month . Like Amy Grant . What an act ! Brother S and Sister Amy . People would love them . "  | " You keep away from them , Nathan . " " I already told the boy he 's wasting his life out here . I could help that kid . " " Nothing ever does change with you . " " That Amy would be a doll if she 'd let her hair grow out . What a dish ! " St. Ed glanced at Amy sitting with her family at a long table . She looked lovely in her blue robe with flowers around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail artist , she wore sunglasses with lime-green neon plastic frames . To think that he 'd once considered her a possible emissary from the devil to destroy the hermitage . She was just the opposite . Without her , he would never have opened up the doors to such a vital monastery . Like the host in the wonderful Parable of the Wedding Feast , to which invited guests had not come , he 'd gone into the highways and byways , inviting the lame , the halt , the neglected , and the rejected . Only Straightgut had n't accepted his call to what was becoming a feast of joy and love . As the monks and guests finished lunch , a white EPA van arrived through the hermitage gates with two EPA men wearing white coveralls and plastic coverings over their boots . " There 's been a little venting from this morning 's test , " one EPA man told St. Ed . " Nothing serious , but we have to check things out . You 're in the path of the fallout . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a lot easier for us if we could have monitors set up here . " " I do n't need monitors . I saw the damn fallout this morning . " The EPA man laughed . " You ca n't see fallout , Father . Radiation is not something you can see , hear , touch , or smell . " The other EPA man said that the radioactive cloud from the venting already would 've passed over the monastery by the time St. Ed claimed to have seen it . In fact , it probably had already crossed the Utah border . By tomorrow it might very well be over u estate New York , and if a rainstorm did n't bring it down , it would eventually dissipate harmlessly in the Atlantic . St. Ed probably just lilt wind-blown sand from a dust storm . St. Ed knew that when a radioactive cloud created a hot spot , It dropped dirt along with invisible beta and gamma rays . He  | was sure he 'd seen the radioactive dust that morning . These nuke people were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on truck tires and buildings . Sure enough , gamma radiation levels were up in the monastery , three times that of normal background radiation . " Nothing to worry about , " the EPA man said . " The readings are still below the acceptable limit . " The EPA men were relieved to hear that almost everyone except the monks had been in the chapel when St. Ed felt the sooty dust rain down on him . " Your party 's over , " the EPA man told St. Ed . " You better get into showers and clean clothes as soon as you can . " The other EPA man climbed onto a bench . The TV crew rushed up to film his speech . " You should proceed immediately to the junction of Route 6 and Route 175 in Warm Springs , " the EPA man announced . " DOE decontamination trucks will wash down your vehicles at the roadblock there . They 'll be pumping water out of the hot springs . " " You double-talking nukeheads , " St. Ed shouted . " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving everyone off ? " " It 's simply precautionary , " the man answered . He pointed toward Nathan . " Get these cameras out of here . " When the EPA men learned that Straightgut had n't been to the feast at all , one said to the other , " Now we 're going to have to traipse all the way out to his dugout to check on him . " " You 'd better be careful you do n't get your head blown off , " Pete Ylarregui told them . " We were out there the other day after that she-devil ran us off from here . " The EPA man pointed toward Amy with obvious disdain . " There 's nobody out there . The dugout looks abandoned . " As St. Ed remembered Amy 's boldness with renewed pride , he told the EPA men , " Straightgut 's there . You just ca n't see him . " Mrs. Scully was in a panic . " I knew I should n't have come out to this dump . " " We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's God 's will . This place is cursed . " " Do n't blame us , " the EPA man said . " Blame the DOE . " People headed for their trucks and vans . Everything was out of control . St. Ed ran toward the monastery gate to head people  | off , but there was nothing he could do . " Wait , " he yelled to some Warm Springs parishioners as their Bronco bucked past him and out the gate . He stood dejected in the white dust as truck after van after station wagon roared out the gate and down through the sagebrush toward the road to Warm Springs . The KLAV-TV van stopped by St. Ed . Nathan rolled down the window . The air conditioner was roaring . " We got more than we bargained for , " he told St. Ed . " You 're going to make tonight 's news . " St. Ed looked around . The feast was in shambles . For years the satanic Department of Energy had lied and covered up radiation releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after almost every test of some small , infinitesimal , harmless leakage . Or the EPA was . But what if they were still lying ? What if the whole alert was a sham , just to ruin the Feast of the Transfiguration and his monastery ? He turned back to confront the EPA men , but they also were gone , on the road toward the Pancake Range and Straightgut 's hot springs . Only his monks and the Indians remained . Dale Mosho and some Shoshone men came down from Sun Cave . During the ruckus Dale had been up on the mountain gathering four long aspen poles for a tepee they planned to set up in the juniper grove . " You might as well leave , too , " St. Ed said . " I do n't want you getting sick . " Dale appeared unconcerned about the venting of the nuclear test . " Indian people have been eating that stuff so long we 're im-mune , " he said , drawing big smiles from his friends . " This is war , " JuneMosho said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power we can get . " At sundown St. Ed joined the Shoshone and other monks outside the canvas tepee , high and conical in the style of the Great Plains , its entrance facing east . Still saddened from the afternoon , he thanked the Indians for staying . St. Ed then turned the ceremony over to the roadman , Dale , who offered up prayers to Jesus , God , Mary , and Peyote before entering the tepee.  | Dale led the group clockwise around the interior of the tepee and took his place facing the entrance , sitting on the clean swept ground behind an altar of sand shaped into a half moon , its horns pointing east . A line drawn in the sand from tip to tip across the moon symbolized the path of the sun and the peyote road . On the center of the moon , Dale placed a large green bulb of peyote cactus with a tuft on top ? Chief Peyote , the vegetal incarnation of the sun . St. Ed knew it was n't the physical peyote that mattered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and its rays , the power of divine grace . " It is n't the peyote itself we worship , " he 'd been told , " it 's the One he can speak to for us . " That One was everywhere , in different incarnations , just as Jesus was still a living god who could appear anytime on earth . At the previous meeting he 'd attended , St. Ed was impressed with its somber dignity . He 'd joined a dozen Shoshone men and women outside the reservation in a makeshift enclosure of blankets draped over sagebrush . The roadman officiating over the ceremony was poor and did n't even have a tent . St. Ed had prayed with the Shoshone until dawn . Although he did n't know the peyote songs , he felt their power . But that was all . He had no visions , no transformations . When the peyote buttons came around , he just got sick . No one said anything , but he knew they suspected him of having bad thoughts . The medicine always kicked you hard if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , " There 's nothing special about me . You all know I 've just acted like a dumb Indian most of my life . I do n't deserve to be no roadman , but you all want me to be , and I 'll do it so Peyote here will show us the way . " Stalks of sagebrush passed around the tent , and St. Ed , imitating the others , rubbed leaves of sage on his hands and clothes . Sacks of Bull Durham and cigarette papers went around the tent , and soon everyone smoked rolled cigarettes lighted with a long flaming firestick . Through clouds of smoke St. Ed noticed Amy take careful tokes from a cigarette squeezed between the tips of her thumb and index finger . He wondered whether she 'd ever smoked anything other than pot . Dale fanned the fire , spreading the smoke upward , and prayed for everyone who had come to the meeting , for those who had  | traveled the peyote road for years as well as those who were just visiting their first meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tepee . " We 're all here just to help each other . You ca n't just be here for yourself . You got to work hard in here , but not just for yourself . You got to think of everyone else , your family , your friends , all the people in the world on the peyote road , and those who ai n't on the road , and even those who are out to get you bad . We are all brothers and sisters and need to get along on this fine earth with all the animals and birds and the plants and everything . That 's why Jesus come to earth , why Peyote come , too . They both here with us now , and bring us light to see , even at night . " Dale sprinkled the fire with sweet juniper incense . With a black and white feathered fan of magpie tailfeathers , he waved smoke skyward . He wore a big black cowboy hat . Around his neck hung a rosary and a necklace of dried mescal beans . The sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person took four . Remembering his last experience , St. Ed did n't want to eat the cactus buttons . But these looked green and fresh . Dried , the previous buttons had turned inside out , revealing fuzzy white down in the inner lobes and tasting like something rotted . June had said that Dale had gotten these buttons just the previous clay from Texas . If it had n't been for Federal Express , they never would 've arrived in time . St. Ed sympathized with followers of the Half-Moon Way because he knew their faith , theologically misguided as it might be , still connected them to the energy of a lost religion . The vision of tln. world as a place of signs , symbols , and divine incarnations had sustained human beings for thousands and thousands of years . Now it was a vision lost in the time-haunted modern world of the last couple of hundred years . His stomach churned , but he did n't get sick . The buttons did n't taste much better than the first time , but he 'd been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death came life . The tepee was quiet . All the cigarettes were out . The fire tender raked coals from the V-shaped fire and added sage . Now was time 16r silent contemplation . He closed his eyes . Ile liked the sternness of the Half-Moon ritual . It was not easy to take peyote , the Indians said . It was hard  | to follow the peyote road , with its banishment of booze and its strict code of selflessness . Married people had to be faithful to each other ; they had to take care of each other and their children . People on the peyote road had to have steady jobs and earn their own living . They were supposed to spend their money on their families , not just themselves . They were supposed to be honest , truthful , friendly , and helpful to one another . If you had a selfish heart , Peyote would kick you hard . He would make you pay . You could use peyote all your life , but peyote was always teaching you something new . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dale had said . Dale sang a fast , energetic song , his voice swinging up high and dropping down low . The drum chief pounded the water drum , a black cast-iron dutch oven with a leather head stretched over it . Dale held his feathered fan and a staff painted with lightning symbols in one hand while the other wildly shook a gourd rattle with a beaded handle and dangling feathers . Songs followed peyote around the tepee . " When we 're singing we 're praying , " Dale said . " We 're going on that trip over the road . " Four times he sang his peyote song before passing the rattle to the man on his left and taking the drum from the one on his right . He shook the drum ; water and charcoal sloshed and rattled inside , and the drumhead skin darkened . " If your mind is straight , the songs will just come into your head and go out your throat , " Dale told everyone . Those who did n't know the real peyote songs could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any song 's good as long as it comes from the heart . Indian songs , gospel songs , hillbilly songs ? they 're all good from the heart . " As Dawn Mosho sang a Shoshone song , Amy 's lips moved , as though she were softly singing with that beautiful voice of hers . Next to Dawn , Teddy pounded the drum . Brother S stared transfixed ; how much he and Amy looked alike , especially now with shaved heads . They could be brother and sister . Amy seemed so at ease , as though she 'd been taking part in Half-Moon ceremonies for years . Dawn repeated the song four times and then beat the drum for the woman next to her . As the drum and rattle made their way clockwise around the tent toward him , St. Ed did n't know what he would sing . The last  | time he 'd chanted a " Dies Irae , " which was fine then , but much too mournful for this celebration . The sodden glumness he 'd felt after the EPA men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . Music was all around him . His heart was pounding like the water drum itself . It was as though he could hear it pounding all through the tent . He felt light and airy . Music was rising all around him like smoke , buoying up his heart . He was glad Nathan and the rest had n't stayed . What would they do now except ruin the singing , even make it impossible with their cameras and recorders ? No way would Mrs. Scully see his sitting in the dirt and singing with a bunch of Indians and eating peyote as anything but a sacrilege , a travesty of devotion , a mockery of religion . Let them go . They would 've been the first to have spurned the wild love of St. Bernard and called the radical devotion of St. Francis a travesty of faith . They would 've said it was silly for the Benedictines and Cistercians to call themselves Black Monks and White Monks . Let them go , with their bad hearts and self-righteousness . Let them say he trivialized religious faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the true church . What would Mrs. Scully have said when Jesus hobnobbed with whores and stinking pig farmers ? Let them go . Divine grace always manifested itself in unexpected ways ? that was a fact of history ? often finding expression through the discreditable and the lowly . Dale glowed with grace . The white tufts sprouting from Chief Peyote on the moon glowed like hot electric filaments . Peyote , it was said , sometimes gave you x-ray eyes . It was like an electrical charge crackling in the prayers and incense swirling up toward the stars through the smokehole at the top of the tepee , where all t he poles pointed like arrows . Let them go . Why was it always the most shallow , most conventional , and least religious people who criticized real manifestations of vision and faith ? Forget them . Let them go . The rattle was in his hand , shaking itself as he sang . The pounding drum made the tent wobble . The song was in the air . Chief Peyote danced on the moon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbed his head , looking ready to roll off the moon and around the fire . Rainbows danced in the vivid flames of the fire as St. Ed sang " Heart ofGold . " He felt the song singing him . The tent was shaking . It was the  | medicine , Chief Peyote , that sang , not him . The women helped the song . June sang along with him . The song was going through her , and through Amy , too , carrying her voice way up high , helping his song about his lifelong search for a heart of gold . After the rattle passed to the next man , who was singing in Shoshone , he held the water drum on his knees . The stick in his hand bounced off the drumhead by itself . He still heard his own song 's lament racing around and around his inner skull . The song made him both happy and sad as he heard the last words of the refrain about getting old . His heart swelled . Smoke rose toward the hole in the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the inky sky , deep and dark blue , crackling with billions of stars . It was as though he were looking deep into outer space , beyond Earth , beyond the galaxy . Stars were all around him . He could hear a rumbling through space , a kind of thunder like an enormous generator running in the sky , throbbing as though he were inside a water drum , gazing at the dark inside of the drumhead through closed eyelids : bright shining daylight began to glow on the other side . He saw Amy , enlarged , transfigured , looking at him with affection , so beautiful in her blue cowl , her head wreathed with rosebuds and daisies , surrounded by blue light stretching out from the flowers like heat lightning in slow motion , flashing out and glowing so bright it pierced his closed eyelids . When he opened his eyes he was staring at the rough yellow canvas of the tepee . June Mosho was singing now , a song slower than the others , more mournful , in Shoshone . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chief Peyote sat motionless on the sand moon like a big green goose egg . Brother S stared through the smoke . The boy looked pale and sick . He 'd grown so thin since his arm had gone paralyzed . St. Ed felt sad for him , sorry for all the suffering he 'd silently endured . He 'd shown incredible courage through his ordeal , through all the temptations he 'd experienced around Amy . St. Ed felt his chest swell with love for the boy , for his efforts to lead a pure life , for trying so hard to be good . He wanted to take Brother S in his arms and comfort him . He felt close to him , so close to Amy , who swayed with lowered eyelids as June shook the rattle and sang . Where else could you  | find kids like these today ? Willing to give up comfort to serve a greater good ? He wanted to kiss them both , as he 'd kissed them that morning in the chapel , both their kisses zinging to his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his with a warmth and fullness he had n't known since before he 'd entered the monastery . Amy was singing now . It was her turn , and she looked at him as she sang . The song made him feel sweaty and chilled all over . He could n't understand the words but he understood its sense of longing and love . Corazon sagrado , corazon quebrado . She was singing to him , for him , a Mexican song , so rich in feeling her eyes were as charged as they were in his vision . Te quiero , to quiero . He understood that much . I love you , I love you . And he did , too . He had n't felt this way since he 'd made feverish vows of love to his wife decades earlier . All those old feelings came back , beyond his control , like electrical currents . It was simply a matter of recognizing what he felt . She was such a lovely woman . He loved her . There was no other way to say it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy .  | August Transformations Be transformed ! Resolve to know that in you , there is a capacity to be transformed . ? Origen , Dialogue with Heraclides , ca . A.D. 240 At midnight Dale sent Amy out with a galvanized bucket to gather water from the hermitage spring . As the woman of the house where the ritual was taking place ? and the young woman the roadman had chosen to honor ? she became the water bearer , the bringer of new life and a new day , the symbolic mother of all . Brother S watched Dale bless the water , making the sign of the cross through it with his eagle wing-bone whistle and sprinkling the congregation with drops flung from his feathered fan . Sprays of water cooled his face . As the embodiment of power for all living things without exception , the most important incarnation of energy after peyote , the sacred water went around the tepee . Brother S lifted the ladle and drank four times as the others had done . The water hit his stomach like ice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood over sagebrush puking through his mouth and nose . He felt a comforting hand on his back . " That 's okay , " he heard Dale say behind him , " Jesus is driving the bad spirits out of you . " He remembered how Amy had n't wanted him near her when she was sick after he 'd found her in the desert . He felt the  | same way . People were walking around outside ? everyone could go out after the water ceremony at midnight ? but he did n't want either Amy or St. Ed near him . " Did you see them ? " he asked Dale . " St. Ed 's in love with Amy . " Dale patted him comfortingly on the shoulder . " That 's a good thing . Love 's a good thing for people . Everyone needs a little love . " Dale blew his eagle-bone whistle four times , screeching in Brother S 's ear , calling back everyone from the midnight break . Back in the tepee , Dale told him that after vomiting he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't want to do it . His empty stomach had become a mouth trying to eat itself . The sharp , pinching pain in his belly made it hard for him to sit up straight . His legs , folded under him on the ground , grew numb . His paralyzed arm throbbed . " Now we got to pray for the sick , " Dale said , asking for prayers for people in the tepee or friends or relatives . Amy called out , " I want to pray for Brother S 's paralyzed arm . " " No , " he blurted out . He did n't want her sympathy or her prayers . Why did n't she just leave him alone ? Damn her ! He stared down into the fire as everyone else prayed for him . At Dale 's insistence he plucked the tuft from the center of a peyote button and chewed the medicine . Energy rushed from his face into his hot stomach . Glowing coals sat in his stomach , and the skin of his face was heatless . Dale chanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How he 'd grown to dislike Dale 's fat , smug face . He did n't want to be in this tepee ; he was just following St. Ed 's orders for all the monks to participate . St. Ed had said that if a monk could n't tolerate the ecumenical spirit of the Feast of the Transfiguration , then another monastery might be the place for that monk to go . Brother S realized what he despised about ecumenical celebra-t ions . He 'd taken part in numerous Protestant , Jewish , and even Zen Buddhist events during his seminary days in Oregon when ecumenicism was all the rage , and he always felt an absence of solitude . In the tent , even his thoughts felt public as everyone sang and prayed for him . Peyote works on you and finds you out , ) ale had said . Everyone was looking at him . The drumming grew louder . The sound of his own breathing heaved like a bellows , a gigantic heartbeat , louder than the drum , as when Jerry had  | beaten him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boom-BOOM , bong-BONG , boom-BOOM ? louder and louder each breath , each heartbeat , shuddered through the tent , like the nightmarish time he 'd breathed ether on the hospital table as a kid with the sounds of each inhalation and exhalation banging against the walls of his skull , bong-BONG , boom-BOOM , bong-BONG . Amy , Ted , Pete , June , Dale , Dawn , Ralph ? all stared at him . Their eyes glowed as though they were shooting x-rays at him . They could read his thoughts . His thoughts were like loud shouts floating around the tent , like letters on the smoke . The bony shell of his skull peeled away and they could look into his brain ; they could see through his rib cage into his angry heart . St. Ed leered , his wet lips parted , his face flushed . The circle of hot faces pressed in on him laughing . They were all laughing at him . He wanted to run from the tent into the night , but his body was paralyzed , his face numb ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me . He seemed to hear the thoughts rather than think them . Help me , Daddy , help me . The faces around the tent grew brighter as though someone were slowly turning up a hidden rheostat in the smoky tepee . The fire grew vivid red . Its flames crackled wildly like arms desperately trying to rise skyward from the bondage of hot coals . The yellow canvas of the tepee glowed more intensely . A spotlight lit St. Ed 's leering face as he now stared across the tent at Amy . St. Ed 's twisted lips , crazed eyes , and red gums revealed a man in the throes of lust . Saliva glinted off his purplish lips . The man was possessed with desire for Amy . Worse , Amy smiled back at him , her face lit with love . Dazzling light sent two stabbing ice picks of pain into his eyeballs when someone pulled back the flap from the tepee . The swelling sun rose and filled the opening of the tepee with its blinding radiance as dawn broke over the mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that served as his bed , he stared into his small metal shaving mirror and saw an ashen face , distorted and sad , his eyes two bloody  | wounds . He 'd been sick through the night . Was there no end to his torments ? He reached for his razor and noticed something different . His right arm moved slightly away from his body . He stood straight and tried lifting his arm . His hand swung forward a couple of inches . The following morning his arm was even better . With some effort he could now swing it about a half-foot away from his body , and then it stopped abruptly , stiffly pointed at an angle toward the floor . But there was movement . No longer did his arm hang paralyzed by his side . Overwhelmed with sadness and regret , he prayed at mass for release from the cloud of confusion smothering his thoughts and feelings . His recovering arm mocked his bad heart . All the time he 'd felt anger at everyone in the tepee , they were praying for him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dale , June , Dawn , and the other Shoshone men and women had generously prayed for his good health . The vision of Amy and St. Ed during the meeting of the Half-Moon Way now seemed a hallucination , the projection of his own warped desires . Their prayers for his health were apparently being answered despite his heart of stone . On the day he was to return to Las Vegas for further tests with the neurosurgeon , he showed St. Ed how he could move his arm . St. Ed grabbed him in a happy bear hug and kissed him on the cheek . " I 've been so worried , " St. Ed said . " I 've prayed for you every day . " Brother S burst into tears . " Hey , " St. Ed said . " Save the water . That arm has a long ways to go before it 's really working . " In Las Vegas , Dr. Pinsky hurried Brother S into the room with the machines . Brother S protested that he did n't need more tests ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . " We have to have another electromiogram for a basis for com-parison , " Dr. Pinsky said . Once again , he was jabbed with needles attached to wires ; electrodes were strapped into place . Electricity jolted his arm , his hand and fingers twitched . Dr. Pinsky read off numbers to the nurse in tight pink pants . Brother S pointed out the place in the crook of his elbow where Dr. Pinsky had jabbed him with a needle ( luring the previous test . A dark , swollen bruise had formed .  | " So sue me already , " Dr. Pinsky said . " Is that what you want to do ? Go ahead , sue me . I do n't care . Just get in line . Your claim would be small potatoes to me . " After the tests , Dr. Pinsky showed Brother S the differing EMG figures on two long pieces of paper . " See the difference here ? " he asked . " There 's definite improvement . You do n't need any more tests . " Dr. Pinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " Brother S asked . " Why has this happened ? " Dr. Pinsky shrugged . " A miracle , a miracle ! " he said mockingly . " Maybe you went to Medjugorea , how do I know ? " " People prayed for me , " Brother S said . Dr. Pinsky laughed . " Do n't be ridiculous . These things are always understandable in medical terms . You probably had a pinched nerve , and it got better . " By the end of the week he could move his arm freely , although it was still weak . The bicep , deltoid , and trapezius had atrophied so that his arm looked shrunken , a seeming remnant of childhood polio . Dr. Pinsky had told him to exercise , and so as he gathered honey he consciously pulled frames of honey from the hives with his right hand . He was late with the honey harvest . The flow of nectar from desert flowers had long dried up , and all the hives were full of buzzing bees with little to do except get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ralph helped him with the harvest but kept their distance from the hives , since they had to jerry-rig themselves with protective clothing . Under the hot August sun , covered from head to foot in baggy white bee coveralls , a helmet and veil , and long leather gloves , Brother S smoked the hives to calm the bees . He looked like some EPA toxic waste worker decontaminating cars , Ralph told him . He thought of the EPA men who 'd barged into the Feast of the Transfiguration . He was glad they 'd run everybody off . He wished they had also run off the Indians so he would 've been spared the horror of that peyote meeting . His stomach felt queasy whenever he thought of that night . How much he hated the feeling of everyone closing in on him : the memory of Dale 's fat , sweaty face , eyes squeezed shut , singing , " Jesus only one , " and the memory of St. Ed lustily glaring at Amy . That night was a mockery oft he beau t divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away from Amy and St. Ed most of the day , for which he was thankful . He was too confused to know what to think about them . For all her goodness , Amy was still the one who 'd brought the most harmful change to the hermitage . Sweat ran down his legs , his neck itched , and his nose stung from smoke and the butyric anhydride he used on the fume board to drive the bees from the frames of honey he pulled from the hives . He made sure plenty of honey remained in each hive for the bees to live on through the winter . At the end of the day his tired arm hung helplessly by his side , but each new morning it was stronger than before . In the honey house he showed Pete and Ralph how to extract honey from the combs . Ralph cut the wax capping from the combs and melted down beeswax . Pete worked the extracting machines , eventually pouring the honey into large plastic containers for later bottling . He wished he had n't asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearness annoyed him . He kept thinking of Pete fondling Amy 's underpants . He knew he should go to St. Ed and reveal his musings before they became an obsession . He remembered the relief he 'd felt on the road from Las Vegas when he 'd at last confessed his sexual temptations to St. Ed . His heart , his soul , his entire being just popped like a punctured balloon . All the tremendous pressure building daily in his heart was simply gone , and he felt light and airy . He 'd opened his heart to his spiritual father , as the desert fathers had insisted monks must do i f they were to experience spiritual growth and defeat the wiles of the devil . At night he turned back to the books St. Ed had given him for guidance . He read again John Cassian 's fifth-century directive : " Nothing displeases the demon of fornication more than to reveal his works , and nothing gives him greater pleasure than to keep one 's thoughts to oneself " But he felt such shame about confessing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John Cassian replied from across the centuries . " It 's a universal and unambiguous symptom that a chain of thought is from the devil if we feel shame in bringing it out into the open before an Old Man . "  | But his Old Man , his desert father , was St. Ed , the man he 'd seen leering at Amy like an old goat . He could n't get that vision ? or hallucination ? out of his mind . Was he supposed to confess that he now thought St. Ed and Amy were poisoning the purity of the hermitage ? That he believed they both might be in league with the devil to form a trinity of evil ? Yes , the desert fathers would say . Nothing must linger in your heart . Tell your spiritual father everything if you are to escape the willfulness of your own heart of stone . Brother S closed the book on his table . Perhaps he was the one losing the battle between God and the devil for the transformation of his own heart . He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time he saw him , he seemed to be with Amy . In the evening he saw St. Ed and Amy walking through the hermitage grounds side by side , heads bowed , hands behind their backs , talking happily . What had happened to St. Ed 's vision of the quiet , contemplative life ? At vigils , vespers , and compline , Amy and St. Ed continued to play tag with their eyes , St. Ed always looking the fool in love with that silly half-smile , and Amy looking calm , lovely , beatific , conscious of her role as the admired one . During the kiss of peace at mass they smacked each other on the lips . It was as though St. Ed read his thoughts . He called him into his office after the weekly chapter of faults . " You still do n't like Amy being a monk , do you ? " " I do n't , " Brother S said , " and besides , she 's not a real monk ; she 's a novice . " St. Ed smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of its incongruous appearance on the face of a forty-nine-year-old man as the self-satisfied smirk of a teenager in love . He could n't confide his dark thoughts to this man . " We 're all just instruments of a greater cause , a greater love . We have to accept the evolution of this community of love . We have to accept our places in it . " " And my place is at the bottom , under your feet . " Brother S regretted his remark as soon as he said it . St. Ed seemed almost delighted with the spiritually elevated position the remark allowed him to assume . He cited the early  | fathers of monasticism . " Nothing is worse to the true monk than spiritual ambition , pride , and especially resentment . Sexual temptations are nothing , mere trifles , compared to those poisonous corrosions of holiness . " " I know nothing about holiness . " " But you will , as long as you turn away from ugly impulses of the willful self and accept your duties and responsibilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that anymore , " Brother S said . " I resign as prior . " St. Ed appeared stunned , but the next morning he calmly announced to the community that Ralph would be the new prior in charge of the work assignments and material needs of the monastery . They all had to pull together , because August fifteenth , the day of their threatened eviction , was rushing upon them . Then came the shocker . He announced to the community that henceforth Amy would be the abbess of the monastery . She would be known as Mother Amy . Brother S could n't believe it . Amy had n't yet taken solemn vows , had n't changed her name , had n't dedicated herself permanently to the celibate life , and yet she was now an abbess and his superior . As usual St. Ed justified his action by appealing to early traditions of monastic life . He spoke of Melania the Younger , famous throughout the world of late antiquity as the saintly and powerful ruler of a monastery of men and women on the Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Christian writings addressed as " my lady , my teacher . " Brother S was sick of talk ; he 'd heard it all before . Amy had dug up all this information about women in early monasticism . Any decision could be validated on the strength of some historical tradition . St. Ed 's signs and symbols were all just words , words , words . Self-interest ruled the sources he cited . Who knew what really had happened in fourth-century Egypt and Syria ? What mattered was what he had learned through his own immediate experience , what he 'd seen in the tent on the night Amy sang songs of love to St. Ed.  | Later that morning , Brother S worked in the juniper grove marking weak hives that would need to be combined and requeened before the winter . Amid regret for abandoning his role as prior , he felt surprisingly relieved , more like his old self , free from bearing responsibilities for a whole community , able to think and work in solitude as he originally had intended when dedicating himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the honey shed , he drove Amy 's pickup filled with emptied frames back where the bees would clean whatever excess honey still clung to the combs . He planned to fumigate and store the frames until the spring . As he spread them out in the shade of the junipers , bees swung around him , eager to get at the traces of honey on the combs . He did n't need his bee coveralls for this job and was glad to be free of the hot helmet and veil . The bed of the pickup was almost empty when Amy came through the grove , wearing work boots , black jeans , and a white cowgirl shirt . " I need the truck to go into Tonopah , " she said . " You 're leaving the hermitage ? " Brother S asked in disbelief . In the ten years he 'd been at the hermitage , he 'd left only three times , each time chaperoned by St. Ed . Now after only a few weeks as a postulant and a novice , Amy was leaving alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the BLM office . I have to leave , " she said . The buzz of bees around her head added a vibrating harshness to her words . The bright sun forced him to squint , causing the halo of light around her shaved head to sprout long rays like spikes or horns . She bore little resemblance to the girl he 'd saved in the desert . " If you wanted to travel around , why did n't you become a missionary ? Why 'd you come here , Amy ? " " Look , " Amy said . " We have to do what we can to survive . We do n't have any time left . St. Ed wants me to pick up some postulants . Rose ? the girl from the TV station ? is joining us . " He could n't disguise his bitterness . " Oh , another woman , " he said . " One woman is n't enough for him . " With surprising quickness she stepped forward , put her hands firmly on his shoulders ; her touch was companionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing . There was a man-to-man intimacy in the way she held him , her fact ' close  | but at arm 's length , like his kindly high school coach imploring him in hushed earnestness to follow his directions and do better . " Do n't be this way , " she said . " I know you resent what 's happening . I 'm sorry for the way I treated you earlier . I was just too casual about sex . I did n't realize how different things are out here . I just could n't know . " " That does n't bother me , " he said . " I 'm worried about you . " " About me ? " " Yes . Because of him . He 's poisoning this monastery , and he 's going to poison you . " She kept her grip on his shoulders . " You have to go see him , " she said . " You have to understand how much he loves you . " Her concerned face swam up toward him , smiling , to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all love you and need you . None of us can fight this thing alone . You 're our brother . " He started to protest . " Amy , I ... " " Promise me , " she insisted . " You 've got to tell him how you feel . You 've got to talk to him . He 's your father . " That afternoon he prayed alone in the chapel . He luxuriated in the warmth of the day , confused but happy , his heart softening as he prayed , unable to think of words to match the desires for spiritual companionship generated by Amy 's kiss . He 'd promised her that he would talk to his abbot . He prayed silently , wordlessly , in a residue of affectionate longing for Amy . Shouts outside broke harshly into his reverie . He heard St. Ed yelling , then another familiar voice he could n't identify until , rushing from the chapel , he saw Jerry , Amy 's old boyfriend , in his red REECO cap and twitching mustache , jabbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down as he yelled , " Do n't luck with me , scumbag . I just got something to tell her , that 's all . I do n't want nothing else to do with her . " " You get the hell off these grounds , " St. Ed shouted back , " right now . " " You get her out here , dude , and then I 'll go . " " I told you she 's not here , and even if she was , I would n't let her see you . "  | Jerry turned and took a step back as Brother S hurried to St. Ed 's side . He pointed his finger like a rapier at Brother S. " Do n't try nothing , pissant . " St. Ed blocked Brother S 's way with his arm . " Wait , " he told Brother S as Jerry went into the chapel . " Let him see for himself " Jerry stormed through the hermitage from cell to cell , throwing doors open and rushing into rooms . He ran across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him outside . When he entered and retreated from the refectory , Teddy stared in shock after him from the doorway , and Jerry had the look of a child , stunned with disbelief , reminiscent of Straightgut after a tantrum . " I told you she was n't here , " St. Ed said . " What would she be doing in a monastery ? Now get the hell out . " " She does n't live here ? " Jerry asked weakly , his confused eyes shifting from monk to monk . " Only monks live in this hermitage , " St. Ed replied . " I told you that . " " They told me she was here , " Jerry said listlessly , then he laughed explosively . " That 's okay with me . I know now what she 's up to . " He turned and walked away from the monks in the direction of the juniper grove . " Where 's his truck ? " Pete asked . St. Ed shrugged . " He just showed up - walking . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon the mystery of Jerry 's arrival was solved ; a drilling truck was parked in the flat beyond the juniper grove . The racket grew louder as the monks filed through the junipers , St. Ed huffing in the lead , to where Jerry and another man , in steel helmets , worked the drilling rig . The throbbing engine and screaming drill dwarfed St. Ed 's voice as he shouted at them , " You 're on private land . " Jerry laughed and pointed across the saline flat toward a line of wooden stakes with tiny strips of orange plastic tied to them . A man behind a tripod squinted through a surveyor 's sextant and waved his arm as another man pounded a stake into the ground , its plastic ribbon fluttering in the hot wind . " You are on public land , " Jerry shouted in return . St. Ed turned back to the monks . " The bastards are right on time . It 's August fifteenth . "  | Back at the monastery Pete said , " Those are holes for seismic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were testing to put down tracks for the MX missiles . They 'll detonate fifty pounds of dynamite in the holes to test for water levels and possible oil reserves . The oil companies do n't want oil reserves covered over with missiles or nuke roads . " " So that 's their game , " St. Ed said . " Now we 'll have to leave , " Brother S blurted out . " No way , " St. Ed said . " But Amy ... " He was thinking of the danger Amy would be in when she returned . Jerry was sure to see her at some point . St. Ed snapped at him . " You mean Mother Amy , ' do n't you , Brother ? " His eyes looked bizarre , as they had in the peyote tepee . All through the service of vespers and compline , in the moments between the monks ' chants , the sound of the drilling rig pierced the quietness of the chapel . That night Brother S could n't sleep . The chugging engine and metallic grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging in his skull . He got up , dressed in his blue cowl , and walked with the dogs through the juniper grove to where the drilling rig , lit with strings of lights like Christmas ornaments , labored alone through the night , boring a dry hole through rock and sand . Soon daily blastings of dynamite would shatter the last remnants of peacefulness at the hermitage . How many days , weeks , even months might this blasting and drilling go on ? If seismic tests revealed possible oil reserves , then the sound of oil rigs might replace the drill . If not , enormous yellow earth-moving equiptment might begin ripping up the ground in preparation for a nuke road into the test site . Then shipments of murderous radioactive waste would rumble dangerously close to the hermitage grounds - unless the monks could stop them . But legal action always took months , even years . By then - whether St. Ed proved that the land was privately owned or the domain of some endangered species - it would be too late . No hermitage could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to take up the bishop 's offer and move to new grounds near Warm Springs . The hermitage was dead . St. Ed 's meddling had killed it ( leader than a post ; the racket of the drill was only another intrusion of the world he 'd already invited into  | the cloister . If they moved to a new cloister , maybe they could start over and do it right this time . Or he could simply run away . But the possibility of starting over and the thought of Amy 's generous spirit kept him from pursuing any plans to abandon the hermitage himself . He felt protective of Amy ? or " Mother Amy , " as St. Ed had snapped at him , indicating his place in the new pecking order of the hermitage . She was the most vulnerable at the moment , subject to St. Ed 's mysterious schemes or Jerry 's brutality . She 'd looked so beautifully serene the other morning , transcendent , as she 'd held his shoulders and pleaded with him . Her touch had been transformative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the press of her lips against his . He walked past the place where he 'd met Amy , the beehives eerily like white tombstones in the moonlight . The dogs Dom and Poverella lifted their muzzles and ears warily as they passed the quiet hives . You ca n't do it alone , Amy had said , none of us can . Any more than a single bee can make a hive , she might have added . He found himself walking down the hill toward St. Ed 's cell . The peacefulness he felt thinking of Amy made him aware of his bitterness toward St. Ed . Perhaps that resentment was as bogus as the rancor he 'd formerly felt toward Amy . He recalled the peace that came to young monks in the Egyptian desert , not from written texts but from the tap of an Old Man 's fingers on the chest of a disciple , bringing relief to a troubled heart . " Throw your will behind you , be without care , " Abba Sisoes had said , " and you will find rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Ed praying for him along with Dale , June , Amy and all the others , praying for his arm to get better . They were all praying for him . Why should he keep his thoughts and fears from them . He would open up his heart to St. Ed . It was after midnight , but a light still flickered in the window of St. Ed 's cell . His heart thumped as he approached the cell , but he felt a calmness , a peacefulness , that he maintained by thinking of Amy 's refrain , " I love you . We all love you and need you . " As he passed the window he glanced into the cell . His heart dropped into his stomach . A candle flickered on the night table . St. Ed knelt by his bed on the stone floor , bent over like a man in anguish , his face buried in the rumpled sheets on the mattress .  | In his outstretched hands , clasped in prayer , he held a pair of Amy 's pink panties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brother S backed away in horror and hurried across the yard , the dogs padding softly at his heels , toward the solitude of his own cell . The next afternoon when Amy returned to the hermitage , he was coming down from Sun Cave , where he 'd gone to be alone . He 'd skipped vigils and mass that morning . Amy parked her truck by the chapel , and a red Nissan pulled up beside her . Two young men got out of the Nissan , and a young woman jumped out of the passenger side of Amy 's pickup . St. Ed rushed forward and hugged and kissed Amy , shook hands with the young men , and embraced the other girl . He pointed toward the cells , where the new arrivals carried duffles and suitcases . New recruits , no doubt . Amy had returned to the hermitage with three more postulants . Brother S tried to hurry past the chapel when Amy saw him . She called out and lifted her hands in welcome . St. Ed turned and glared , his flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance radiant , as she 'd been that night when she 'd returned to the peyote tent in her role as the water girl , bearing new life , a new day .  | His disciples said , " When will you be revealed to us and when shall we see you ? " Jesus said , " When you strip and are not ashamed , and you take your clothes and throw them under your feet like little children , and trample them , then you will see the Child of the Living One and you will not be afraid . " ? The Gospel of Thomas , 2:37 St. Ed knew he was getting himself into hot water by not returning Amy 's underpants . At first , he simply forgot . He 'd thrown them into the bottom drawer of the pine bureau in his cell , and there they lay , innocently , entangled with his own underwear , while he occupied himself with Brother S 's paralyzed arm and the Feast of the Transfiguration . He saw the panties again on the morning he dressed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get those back or toss them out . " They had served his purpose : weeks earlier , Amy had come to him about the two pair of underpants snatched from the clothesline . He 'd gotten her to open up without having to approach her or reveal his knowledge that Pete , overcome by temptation , had secretly stolen the first pair . Her confession had put the matter in his hands : she seemed to trust that he would prevent or punish future transgressions . Her resentment seemed dissipated . The crisis had passed .  | Still , he did n't return the panties . On the night after Jerry had shattered the quietness of the hermitage , he again saw the underpants . He pulled them from the drawer . They were pale pink , no-nonsense bikini panties , without designs or frills , so different from those of his former wife . He remembered the brilliant colors and outrageous stripes and polka dots of underwear his young wife had worn , sexy glimpses of which flashed at unexpected moments both day and night as she crossed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties . They had been on an adventure together , his new bride and he : they both believed in God as the source and endpoint of all desire . Their erotic nights had blended into mornings when they attended vigils at St. John 's monastery on the banks of the Charles River . The flickering gray screen of the television showing the war dead ? the news gray even when in color ? gained their attention at the foot of the bed when they paused between feverish couplings , late at night , to smoke and watch TV as their ardor regenerated , his wife 's sexy panties , a wisp of slinky satin and lace , hanging from a bedpost or flung wildly to the floor , a blazon of sensuality mocking the cold shadow of death stretching from Southeast Asia to the dim corners of their little Cambridge apartment ? maybe not so much mocking death as embracing it , making it part of the fear that fueled their desire . Between the iron clamps of sex and death they found in the lingering dread of those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the diocesan social services program . They believed at first they could make a difference . They arranged housing , conducted food drives , raised money for medicine , but the needs of the poor were endless . He realized his efforts were dust in the wind . They drank and smoked pot with friends whose wild talk , like theirs , flirted with unspoken spiritual longings banished from politer conversation . They read recent books by French intellectuals who took such longings seriously and dared to propose that of the three kinds of human eroticism ? physical , emotional , and religious ? religious eroticism was the most acute . Americans were quick to label mystical eroticism as abnormal because it was outside their experience . They meditated . They got stoned . They hit dead end . He grew afraid of the extremes they 'd pursued . In trying to he ( idly human , they 'd become less so ; after  | all , had n't sexual continence and the awareness of death made humans human ? He pulled back ; she called it withdrawal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are you going ? " He toyed with thoughts of monasticism as a way of pursuing his humanity to its fullest extent , but his wife had had enough . " Everything is an extreme with you , " she said . They had no kids ; it was easy for her to leave . He remembered the rainy morning when he discovered she was gone , really gone , after he 'd pulled open a bureau drawer - once gloriously bulging with clouds of billowy underthings , a wondrous firmament of rainbow hues - and found it emptied , all colorful panties vanished , leaving it as vacuous as the drizzly day and his dank , empty soul . He looked down at Amy 's panties dangling from his fingers . It was too late to return them . What excuse could he give her for waiting so long ? They would just bring back bad feelings from the time they were stolen . He could throw them into the trash , but then Brother S or Pete or Ralph might come across them . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wait until winter and throw them into the refectory 's wood stove ? He imagined himself turning to see all the monks staring at him as he dug a hole at night or bent over the wood stove to make a fire . He imagined one of the dogs digging them up and trotting across the yard with them in its mouth . He could stick them in his pocket and dispose of them the next time he went to Warm Springs , but then he would be aware of the panties wadded up in his pocket , burning his thigh like a charcoal briquette . Or , distracted , he might jerk them out at dinner when thinking he was retrieving a handkerchief . The rackety drilling outside , its disruptive noise intensified in the summer night air , rattled his skull . Agitated , he turned toward the open drawer where the panties had nestled for the past weeks , but after an aborted gesture to return them , he dropped to his knees , his elbows on his bed , the panties still in his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big deal ? The pink panties were a scrap of cloth , a swath of rayon , nothing more . True , as he twirled them in his hands , they made him think of Amy , the way he 'd seen her when he had come upon her naked in the juniper grove , innocently so ,  | her tan skin like a body suit covering her nakedness as effectively as a pair of tight tan leotards . She was less sexually provocative than her sister Debbie in her white pants on the Feast of the Transfiguration . He already missed her . She 'd been gone only two days and he missed her terribly . He loved her good sense and courage . From the moment she 'd attacked those fools from the EPA , he knew she could do the job . What did gender matter ? The only regret he had in elevating her to abbess was its effect on Brother S. But what could he do ? The community as a whole was more important than any individual . Still , it hurt him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to Amy about Brother S - how he had skipped vigils and mass that morning , how he 'd appeared in the afternoon , distraught over Jerry 's visit , shouting out Amy 's name , obviously still obsessed with her . He still kept everything walled up inside , toxin breeding toxin , ready to erupt . He wished he knew how to help him . That poor boy ! That poor tormented son of a bitch ! St. Ed pushed his anguished face into the mattress . He twisted the panties around his sweating fingers . The racket outside grew insufferable ; a sharp pain in the back of his skull split into two dentist 's drills pushing against the tops of his eyeballs . How long would he be able to endure this violence ? " Dear God ! " he prayed fervently . " Deliver us all from this evil ! Deliver me from the pitfall of my bad temper and bad judgment ! Deliver that poor dear boy - your sweet , loving servant - from the hellish torments of his suffering heart ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned toward the window and thought he saw a ghostly flash of blue . Perhaps it was a visitation , a sign that his prayers would be answered . His awareness of the racket of the drill overwhelmed his reflections . He pinched out the candle flame on his night table . He climbed into bed aware that he had sleepless hours of tossing and turning before the coming of vigils . With Amy 's return to the monastery he learned of the DOE 's plan of running a road not nearby - as they 'd previously expected  | ? but right through the hermitage grounds into the north end of the test site . That was the reason Jerry was preparing holes for seismic tests to give a geologic profile of the area . The DOE was catching too much flak over the proposed routes near more populated areas to the south . The new route would follow the existing hermitage road from Reveille Valley through the Kawich Range and down into air force land , where the DOE had an easement all the way to the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would affect no one except the monks , who , as the DOE knew , had orders to move . " The fucking bishop is in cahoots with them , " St. Ed said . " They do n't need his support , " Amy said . " They already figure God 's on their side . " In Tonopah she 'd looked through BLM animal census records to see if the range of the endangered desert tortoise extended as far north as the hermitage . They might then have legal means to stop the DOE . The desert tortoise was raising havoc with developers outside Las Vegas . It had developed a virus , its early symptoms resembling a human cold , including a runny nose and raspy breathing . The turtles were losing weight and dying . Construction of shopping malls and housing developments had been snuffed because they would harm the tortoise 's environment . The annual cross-desert off-road race from Barstow to Las Vegas had been canceled . " The problem is that the turtle 's environment does n't come up this far , " Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mojave . " " Ca n't we say we 've sighted a few around here ? " St. Ed asked . " Our claim would n't fly , " Amy replied . " All the environmental groups know better . We would n't get any support . " " What about all the other little birds and snakes and lizards and rabbits , the shrubs and trees and weeds , that are going to get hurt when one of these nuke trucks overturns ? " " But their species wo n't die out . " " There must be something endangered around here besides us ? some damn snail or field mouse or something . If we file complaints , at least maybe we can delay things . We 've got to try everything we can . " He worried about Jerry seeing Amy and warned her to keep  | away from where they were drilling . " He does n't care about me , " she said . " He 's already living with someone else . It 's you he wants to get back at , for taking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally , working for the DOE , than he can alone . " Day and night the drilling went on , followed by blasting . Strings of dynamite lowered into the deep holes exploded , sending shock waves through granite or shale or tuff or sand or whatever lay underground ; the seismophones picked up the underground vibrations according to their speed of travel through varying densities of soil and rock . The sound of blasting came closer to the monastery , causing one of the boys who 'd come out with Amy to leave . The boy took his pickup with him , claiming the racket offered no possibility for the sort of contemplative life he 'd envi-sioned . " We 've got real problems , " St. Ed told Amy . " I 'm tempted to get Straightgut to sabotage that drill . He 'd know how . " " What ? Blow it up , and lose three more of his fingers and get all of us arrested ? " " He 'd have other ways . " Then the drilling and blasting stopped , as abruptly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as ominously as the previous noise . He attempted to bring the monas-tery 's routine back to normal . He liked the two new kids who 'd come out with Amy and stayed as postulants . The boy , named Joe , wiry , sandy-haired , not unlike Brother S when he 'd first arrived , turned out to be a capable worker and a disciplined contemplative . Rose was the young woman in the yellow T-shirt he 'd first met at the KLAV-TV studio during his interview . She had lived in a kibbutz for a year after college and then worked in an ashram outside Las Vegas , where she became certified as a yoga instructor before going to work at the TV station . " I needed the money after the ashram deal MI apart , " she said . " We were supposed to be sexually continent , but I got involved with someone and got thrown out . " " That could cause the same problem here , " St. Ed told her . " This hermitage is full of men trying to be celibate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " unless Mother Amy shares nay preference ; I have no interest in your men . "  | After St. Ed 's TV interview , she said , the image of the hermitage had haunted her . She did n't know whether she could lead the contemplative life , but she found herself constantly desiring it . " That 's the sign of grace , " St. Ed said , paraphrasing Augustine . " The entire life of a good contemplative is nothing less than holy desire . " Under the imposing silence of the drilling rig , St. Ed directed the monks in their daily routines . He even attempted to work on his book . August fifteenth had come and gone , but no further word arrived from the bishop . He was sure a letter or phone message awaited him in Warm Springs . In the disturbing calm , he tried to think of what to do about Brother S. He called Amy to his cell one evening . " His arm is better , " he said , " but he is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm really worried about him . " " This has been going on ever since he found you on the desert , " he said . " Now he 's upset about Rose and Joe reading mystical works . " " That 's a lot of hooey ! He 's upset about you , Amy . He 's tormented by sex . " " Do you think he 's the one who took my underpants ? " " No , I do n't . But I think he 's in heat , and I ca n't do any more for him . " " And I can ? " " You have to talk to him . " " I have talked to him . " " I mean really confront him . It 's the only chance we have of ridding ourselves of what 's eating his heart . He 's poisoning this monastery . " They walked together in the fading evening light through the juniper grove , where , beyond the stand of trees , they glimpsed the yellow metal scaffolding of the silent drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept virgins into the monastery , " he mused , as they walked side by side . " Many of the first monks had been married , or at least had sowed some wild oats . People today make too much of sex . " " You 're the one who made the rules , " she responded . " I did n't make them . I 'm following rules of celibacy that 've evolved . My point is that you can be celibate without being a vir-  | gin . " He glanced in her direction . He realized he had n't talked so frankly with her since that morning after her arrival when she tried pushing herself bluntly into the hermitage . He hoped she would n't misunderstand his intentions . He spoke of how most of the clergy in the early church had been married and how the emphasis on chastity had evolved ; it was n't until the year 1139 that the seventh canon of the Second Lateran Council had officially promulgated clerical celibacy . " So you 're suggesting that since the rules of celibacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's not impossible , " he said , choosing his words carefully . " Or they might at least be modified . To get our minds on more important things . Things like greed and too much wealth , not sex , were the real temptations for early ascetics like Melania . " He was also thinking of Jerome and John Chrysostom ; for all their contemporary reputation as doom-saying preachers against the sexual snares of what Jerome called in the fourth century some " hot little body , " they actually spent more time condemning the unjust treatment of the poor , the downtrodden , the homeless , the rootless , whom they called " blessed . " " Our failure to help someone like Straightgut could be a greater curse on this hermitage than any sexual lapses that might occur here . Temptations of the flesh ca n't be more important than the dangers of nuclear waste to all of us , including Straightgut . " Amy appeared uneasy whenever he brought up Straightgut . " Maybe we should set our own house in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We ca n't make such distinctions , " he said . " If we 're to follow the example of the first monks , we must embrace those we can not bear to see . Even those who make us vomit , as Jerome says . " " But Straightgut does n't have a religious bone in his body . " " Monks are made , Amy . " The ease of talking to Amy with such frankness amazed him . But was n't this what he always wanted ? a return to the ways of early asceticism ? These thoughts occupied him at night as he tried to work on The Death of Time . He recalled that companionship between ascetic nun and women was so widespread in the early church that Romans and ( ; reeks disparagingly called Christian women   the " call-in girls " and " love birds " of clergy ; they could n't imagine women in such intense relationships with men who were not husbands , brothers , or fathers . In the eastern church , the ease with which ascetic men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " angels of God " and " disciples of love , " broke down the barriers of sexual identity . In Syria , Simeon of Emesa thought nothing of dancing in taverns or entering women 's public baths , stripped naked , his robe piled on his head like a turban . He was a holy fool , a disciple of love . Could the Monks of the Transfiguration become such " disciples of love " ? He scanned through Gregory of Nyssa 's fourth-century reflections on death and time . According to Gregory , the celibate life was not so much suppression of the sexual drive as liberation from the numbing sense of time generated through the specter of death in human hearts . To embrace celibacy was to beat the fear of death . He thought of what Amy had said when they parted , " I 'd rather be free and celibate than sexually active and abused the way I was with Jerry . " He wondered if his own doubts about celibacy that afternoon were a temptation . He 'd been caught in the odd position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the freedom of celibacy to her sexual bondage with Jerry . Gregory of Nyssa had seen the same freedom when he visited his sister Macrina and her monastic companions near the woods at Annesi . These women had refused to follow society 's clock of measuring time according to a succession of children , one generation after the other , into the grave . They no longer hostaged themselves to those social institutions of tainted time ? betrothal , marriage , childbirth , parenthood , grandparenthood ? created to counter the obliterating power of death . They chose to encounter the soul 's capacity for spiritual delight in eternal time . One evening before compline as St. Ed walked side by side with Amy through the hermitage , he experienced a momentary sense of absolute peacefulness ; everything seemed all right . Rich , buttery sunlight bathed every desert bush , every monk 's cell . The crunch of their sandals on rocky soil tolled in the quietness hugging the hermitage . He had an impulse to tell her about the  | panties ; he felt so at ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he saw Brother S striding up the hill in the direction of Sun Cave , head bowed , shoulders hunched , as if dragging a weight , glancing back with a dark grimace . Amy saw him , too . " I tried to talk to him , " Amy said , pointing her chin in the direction of Brother S , " but it did no good . He said he had no problem with me . He said he loved me with the love of a brother , just as I loved him with the love of a sister . " St. Ed felt himself reaching the end of the line with Brother S. " That 's cute , " he replied sarcastically . " Then what 's his problem ? " " You , " Amy answered . " He says you 've destroyed the hermitage and are a threat to me . " " If things are so horrible , why does he stay ? " " He says he 's worried about me . " " About you ? " " Yes , me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blasting erupted once again , louder than ever , just over the ridge from the newly constructed cells where the postulants stayed . Brother S barged into the library where St. Ed had his papers spread out on the table . St. Ed sat barefooted wearing a sleeveless undershirt with straps and a low scooped neck that exposed a graying puff of his hairy chest . " They 're back , " Brother S croaked , a raspy tightness in his throat , his gaunt face distraught . " Jerry 's here with those others . They 've moved the drilling rig up by the water head . " He meant the spot where the hermitage spring flowed to the surface from its hillside source . " They 're really in the hermitage now . " St. Ed resisted an impulse to slam his pencil down on the table . No sense in doubling the hysteria in the room . " I 'll take care of this , " he said . " You can go back to your chores . Just keep away from the rig . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're here . The only thing to do is move . We have to move . " " We 're not moving . We 're here because of who we are . If we do n't stand up to this evil , no one will . " Brother S 's voice cracked . " You 're the evil , " he said . " You 've brought all this here . I know , I saw you . You wo n't move because  | you know the bishop wo n't let this go on ? with Amy and Rose and whatever other women you bring here . I saw you with Amy 's underpants . I know the devil has your heart , but I wo n't let him take mine . Either we move , or I leave . " Those damn silly underpants ! He should 've known better than to keep them . Play with fire and you get burned . He followed Brother S outside and stopped abruptly , the sound of the drilling rig grinding in his skull , the harsh sunlight exposing him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stripped naked and branded , his sins exposed for all to see . When he found Amy , he called her from the refectory where she and Rose were canning late summer tomatoes and told her of the debacle with her underpants . Amy 's hands were pink with juice of overripe tomatoes . They stood in the sunlight by the cinder-block wall of the refectory . He remembered how he had stood in bright sunlight when he 'd been told of Brother Luke 's death ; no rain , no thunder , no darkness marked the solemnity of the moment , just bright , indifferent sunshine . Amy squinted up at him in the glaring light . " I 'm relieved it was n't Brother S , " she said . Her calmness soothed him . She claimed that she 'd put the whole incident behind her except for a recurring fear that Brother S 's torments were somehow tied to his stealing her panties . Relief from the revelation of his innocence counterbalanced her dismay at Pete 's guilt . " Pete has never been anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm surprised . " " I did n't want you to have hard feelings toward Pete , " St. Ed said , as he explained his own byzantine machinations to hide Pete 's guilt . " I do n't , " she said . " I think Pete 's a sweetheart . I just wish I 'd known earlier that it was n't Brother S. " Her subsequent silence and look suggested that he 'd been remiss in keeping everything from her . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I should 've told you . " She looked amused . " Mejor es tarde que nunca . ' That 's what my father says ? better late than never . It seems so long ago ... " Her voice drifted off , as if accompanying her thoughts back to that time when she 'd been so upset about the disappearance of her  | underwear . Her obvious affection for Brother S and relief at his innocence bothered St. Ed . Was she totally indifferent to his own involvement ? " It was so confusing , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermitage was how two monks lived alone out here . Everyone assumed you were sleeping together . I guess I did , too . You ca n't know such a different life is possible until you live it . Love is so different from what I 'd thought . " The affection he longed for appeared in the smile she now directed at him . During the years he was at Spencer Abbey , no one had ever approached him sexually . Not that these things did n't happen ? of course they did ? but he 'd seen or heard nothing of the kind , at least while he was there . " I could no more sleep with Brother S , " he said , " than with my own brother , or father , or mother . " " That 's what I did n't understand before . People are disgusted with the idea of having sex with their own family . But it 's hard to realize the same can be true for a family of monks . " " But we can have temptations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached for his . " Love does n't have much to do with swiping a pair of under-pants . " Her laughter was light and musical . " But I want them back . I 'm running low . " That afternoon he told Pete that Amy now knew everything that had happened with her underpants . " I hope she does n't think I 'm an asshole , " Pete said . St. Ed assured him that , in fact , she 'd called him a " sweetheart . " Pete confessed that when he 'd taken the underwear , it was nothing personal . He had n't even identified the underpants with Amy at all . He hardly knew her then . " I feel so different about her now . I could no more think of stealing her panties or sleeping with her than I could with my own darling sister . " It was Saturday . He had to go into Warm Springs for Sunday mass , but he could n't leave Amy amid the emotional debris of the week . He told Pete , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on Brother S. He 's threatening to leave . " Pete lifted his wiry eyebrows . " I 'm not going near him , but if  | he leaves , we 're going to have a real mess trying to run this place . " As Amy drove through the hermitage gates - they had taken her pickup - St. Ed told her of Brother S 's threat . She reached across the seat and put a hand on his forearm . " I really should stay then . " He shook his head . " I 'm not leaving you in that hermitage with Jerry running around like a nut and Brother S so upset - that poor boy ! " " It would be terrible if he leaves . " " Worse than terrible . A vocation is like a marriage . Once it 's dead , it 's dead . But it breaks your heart . It 's a tragedy . An outsider ca n't rekindle it . But we have to think about what we 'll do if he does leave . " He meant practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still essential for keeping the hermitage functioning . No one else knew what to do with the bees . They all could finish the summer 's harvest from the garden , but what about next spring 's planting ? And who would design and direct the building of new cells ? Who else could keep the pickups repaired , the tractor running , the irrigation system working ? " Maybe we should just move , " Amy said . " Nowhere physically is everywhere spiritually . " She was quoting The Cloud of Unknowing . It was precisely such quotations that had impelled him to keep mystical books out of the hands of Brother S as a young postulant ; mystical gleanings of the oneness of all things did n't help keep a monastery functioning from day to day . " We ca n't abandon our physical and spiritual home , Amy . " " But it 's being destroyed . " " The war is n't over . " He had a plan . He wanted to swing by Straightgut 's dugout . Shortly after the nuclear venting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermit to give up his dugout and move to the monastery . Straightgut refused , Pete reported , and went into a tirade against the EPA , the DOE , and the BLM . But he did admit that the monks were the only friends he had in the desert , and he was afraid . Despite Straightgut 's problems with women , if he could just see Amy as monk and talk to her- as a monk - he could he persuaded , St. Ed felt sure , to join them . It was worth a try . Straightgut was the  | only person who had the practical skills to replace Brother S ; he had even worked with a beekeeper as a kid . When he used to visit the hermitage regularly he 'd let the bees sting his gnarled hands , their venom a soothing antidote for his arthritis . The truck bounced and lurched through the muddy ruts blocking the entrance to Straightgut 's dugout . Amy waited in the cab as St. Ed called into the dark cavern . No answer . " He ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Straightgut 's three-wheeled ORV with its fat tires parked nearby . It was too hot to wait in the cab , so they moved to the torn truck seat propped in front of the dugout . A pale lunar sliver , nearly translucent , hung delicately in the deepening blue sky as the sun dropped . Sulfurous steam writhed above the hot springs pool . " We used to come here a lot . " St. Ed told Amy how he and Brother S had first met Pete during one of their frequent visits to soak in the hot springs . " Seems so long ago . " " We 're here now , " Amy said . He turned to look at her . Her profile staring out over the hot pool seemed etched in black shadow , like a film negative , against the sky 's flaring brightness . Pinpoints of perspiration glinted on her pursed upper lip , while bits of light clung like static electricity to her curving eyelashes . " Well , why not ? " he said . She stood up and followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his robe over his head , and his vision cleared from within the dark folds of cloth , he saw her with her back to him , stepping free from her robe , already pooled around her ankles , lifting one bare foot , then the other , as if dancing . The outline of her brown back , naked ? she wore no bra under her robe ? wide across her shoulders , tapered down to her waist , then flared outward again toward her hips and ? he could n't believe it ! ? the elastic edge of the pale pink panties . She slipped the panties down her legs and stepped into the steaming water . He splashed into the pool with exaggerated movements as a defense against the sudden heat of the water . Waves rolled up on his hairy chest and lapped his throat as he bobbed up and down , the wavering steam blurring his vision . Submerged to her gleaming shoulders , Amy rose , her exposed breasts slick and poised buoyantly on the water , before sinking from view once again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon toward the setting sun , insouciant , regally calm ; for the first time she slowly looked his way , her lowered eyelids relaxed over drowsy eyes . " Pretty hot , " she said , giving him a calm , sleepy smile . Her languorous look showed how tense she 'd been until she eased into the comforting water . A knot in the back of his own neck loosened . He thought of the radium pulsing through the water , his muscles and blood absorbing its revivifying energy . The last time he 'd soaked in the waters was with Straightgut , the day he 'd seen the solitary blue cloud that became the sign for his monastic vision . He looked up at the cerulean sky , cloudless , peaceful . Why would Straightgut want to leave this peacefulness for the turmoil of the monastery ? The hermitage should be here , now , at these timeless hot springs . The calm fusion he felt in the water with Amy was what he longed for in the monastery with all his monks . He felt himself dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the boundaries of his body into the pool where he was touching her and she was touching him through the energy that flowed into the steam and water between them . Three quick gunshots cracked like bombs . The water swirled and churned . Something hard as a wooden two-by-four smacked against his chin , splashing his eyes momentarily blind . He touched his chin . Blood came away on his fingertips . He whirled toward the dugout , where a buzz-saw roar ripped the air . Hunched over the handlebars like a child on a tricycle , Straightgut roared away from the hot springs , the top of his pith helmet sinking from sight as he sped across the desert salt flats . St. Ed cried out , " Oh , no ! Dear God , please , no ! " Amy floated face down just below the surface of the water , the back of her dark head and the hump of her shoulders exposed like islands . The water darkened . A bloody cloud surged up around her motionless body .  | When he appears he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he will readily toss his head back so that a person can see straight up to his brain , which appears like the fire of hell . A fiend can have no other brain and he is well satisfied if he can induce a person to look at it , for the sight will drive a human being out of his mind forever . ? Anonymous , The Cloud of Unknowing , ca . A.D. 1375 With a yellow canvas duffle slung from his shoulder , Brother S climbed the hill toward Sun Cave under a midnight sky and looked for the last time down on the hermitage . As he passed the drilling rig , Poverella and Dom bounded up to him and sat with cocked heads , disappointed and quizzical , after he ordered them to stay . Near the junipers , the white bee boxes , ghostly in starlight , rebuked him like a cluster of tombstones harboring loved ones he 'd abandoned . The dogs would be all right , but who 'd take care of the bees ? Rejected , they 'd eventually swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some would die . He could do nothing to prevent such loss . He had to leave . St. Ed had returned that afternoon with the news . Amy was dying . After he 'd pulled her unconscious from the hot springs pool and wrapped her head and wrist with gauze from the firstaid kit in the pickup , he 'd raced to Tonopah . An ambulance took her to Las Vegas , where she now lay comatose in intensive care .  | Dr. Pinsky was the neurologist on call when she arrived . He performed emergency surgery to release pressure from her brain . One bullet had cracked through her skull , another had broken her wrist ? she must 've flung her arm upward after the first shot to catch the bullet in her wrist as she did ? and the third missed . One of the bullets , it seemed , had ricocheted and nicked St. Ed at the point of the chin , chipping the bone . Another centimeter deeper into his chin and the bullet probably would 've knocked him unconscious , and both he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're the one who should 've been murdered , " Brother S had shouted at St. Ed , " not Amy . " St. Ed , his eyes stunned with grief , looked as though he were about to protest , but said , " I understand how you feel . " " I ca n't stay here anymore . I 'm leaving . You 've ruined every-thing . " St. Ed made no effort to stop him . Under the starry sky , sweeping dizzyingly westward as he walked northward , he reached Warm Springs at first light . Dawn behind the bare hills appeared like a harsh slap , a horrid reminder that he was in a nightmare from which he could not awake . If St. Ed had n't invited Amy , Pete , Teddy , Ralph , and Rose to become monks , if he had n't opened the doors to secular doubters and Indian peyotists , if he had n't tried to get Straightgut to become a lay brother , Amy would never have been shot and he would n't be abandoning the hermitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the world had killed them . But then why did he feel so guilty ? Was n't he just running back into the world that had ruined them ? He had to find another hermitage ? a true monastery ? or lose his soul . First , though , he needed money . He remembered the combination to the parish mailbox from the time St. Ed had sent him to the general store after his operation . He tore open the envelopes . Among junk mail , a traffic summons , letters , and bills , he found checks totaling S270 . Not enough . He threw everything but the checks into a dumpster behind the store and jimmied open a window to St. Ed 's trailer . He took the bank book from a desk drawer , and after hitching a ride to Tonopah with a rancher pulling a horse trailer , he deposited the checks and withdrew five hundred dollars while wearing his  | Cistercian robe and black scapular ? no questions asked ? and bought a bus ticket to Las Vegas . Colored lights flitted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . The clatter of slot machines greeted him inside the station , along with posters of casino shows . The pink , nearly bare behind of a dancing girl , surrounded by flickering neon , loomed from a large poster advertising the musical revue " HOT ! HOT ! " Small devilish horns sprouted through curly red hair on the dancer 's temples . He took a room at the cheap hotel north of the strip where he and St. Ed had previously stayed . The elderly woman behind the counter , her small face , like that of a lot of old-time Nevada women , leathery from years of desert air and cigarettes , remembered him . She put the room key down on the counter with a loud click . " Room 14 , Father . Same room you priests had before . " The woman 's knowing look discomfited him . Behind her , a younger woman , who looked like her daughter , sat smoking a cigarette and watching a tiny portable TV next to the phones . " Goddamn it , " the young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the knob back and forth , flipping channels , but they all showed the president at a press conference . The president , despite his vapid expression and hoarse voice , projected a dapperness and buoyancy in his crisp blue suit moments before his image , at the violent push of the young woman 's finger , swirled into a funnel of darkness , leaving the screen gray . " Pardon her Latin , Father , " the woman said . " She 's been on edge . " Before the woman could begin confiding in him about her daughter 's " edge , " he scooped the key from the counter and fled . In the room he flicked on the television and lay on the bed . The curtains were drawn . It was peacefully dark . On the screen , a blurry president jabbed his finger like a puppet at reporters to indicate the next questioner . " As far as the Nuclear Waste Repository is concerned , " the president was saying to a reporter , " it 's going into operation . We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactors in this country over the past fifty years must he dealt with . We ca n't just wish it away . At this nionnent t rucks are carrying spent fuel rods to Nevada , where they will he safely deposited in temporary storage bins at Shoshone  | Mountain . This operation is of the utmost importance to the environmental safety and economic growth of the whole nation . It is not just a local issue . The disposal site will be finished and the waste will then be permanently buried . This operation has the full support of Congress and the Department of Energy , and I will personally see to the enforcement of its success . " Like the enraged girl downstairs , he sickened hearing about nuclear waste and the Shoshone Mountain dump . The DOE had so persistently pushed its scheme onto the public that even the president accepted its madness as logical . As if forced to look into the devil 's brain , they all in some way had gone out of their minds . When he awoke he reached in a panic for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the switch . He 'd been startled from a terrible dream in which he was trying to run , his legs heavy . Caught in a strange sense of timelessness , he did not know whether it was day or night until he pulled back the thick curtain . Across the street a yellow neon sign with missing letters glowed in the night : FR NK 'S LIQ ORS . Through the wall he heard two men 's muffled voices in the room adjoining his , then the sound of a fart like ripping canvas , followed by one man 's loud laughter . The next day he moved to an even cheaper motel farther up the street . For every six nights he got a seventh free . He again turned on the television hoping to hear something about Amy and the search for Straightgut , but the shooting apparently no longer remained newsworthy ; the discovery of the mutilated body of a casino dancer in an abandoned van near the Valley of Fire dominated the local crime news . He 'd read in a newspaper what he already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he pulled the heavy curtains during the day , the room went completely dark . He stared up at the ceiling , surrounded by the rattle of an old tan Fedders box air conditioner , persistent as a power lawn mower , with a missing dial that made it impossible to adjust . He tried pushing the row of four colored buttons ? white , salmon , black , and ivory ? on the face of the air conditioner , but his efforts were useless . The machine roared insistently . From a Chinese restaurant down the street he brought back to his room take-out orders of mixed vegetables and cold noodles in cardboard containers with little metal handles . The smell of sesame and soy sauce helped disguise the faint metallic odor of '  | disinfectant and bug spray that emanated from the soiled and cigarette-burned green shag carpet . Even with the drapes drawn , pinpoints of light , like tiny sequins , sparkled in the brown-plastered ceiling . At night he could hear voices through the walls despite the air conditioner . When he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't go through with it . He felt unworthy . What could he tell them ? He 'd abandoned his own hermitage ; he could n't also abandon Amy . He was surprised at how much money he 'd already spent ; even the cheapest food and rooms had gone up so much more than when he was last on his own after leaving the seminary and moving to Oregon . He 'd thought five hundred dollars was plenty of money ; it would 've been ten years ago , but at this rate he would soon be broke . He even hesitated buying another newspaper to look for news of Straightgut 's possible arrest or Amy 's condition . He remembered when he 'd left the seminary ; it had been so long since he 'd actually had to pay for anything , he 'd picked up a newspaper in a restaurant and walked off with it . The embarrassing fuss the restaurant cashier caused ? she 'd shouted for the manager ? stimulated his memory as he 'd come into town . He had to be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't want to walk away from a meal without paying for it as though he were still at the hermitage . He felt relieved to return to his darkened room with his little containers of take-out . After calculating the cost by city bus to the hospital , he decided to walk at dusk . Carrying his Cistercian habit in his duffle so as not to attract attention on the street , he put it on in the hospital parking lot and asked the receptionist at the front desk for a pass to the intensive care unit . With a glance at his monastic garb , she handed him a large pink pass without comment . Despite his earlier two visits for his paralyzed arm , the hospital seemed unfamiliar ? he 'd previously come in through the emergency entrance . He followed the arrows and signs on the wall to the intensive care unit ; for a moment , he thought he 'd come to the wrong wing . No nurses or doctors were in sight . A long , dim room without windows was lined on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked down the row of beds , passing fi ) reshortened figures of bodies under white  | sheets , hardly able to distinguish one sleeping face from the other , covered as they were with various attachments and tubes . He was shocked at the sight of Amy so diminished on her back under a white sheet , tubings of oxygen hooked into her nostrils , a long , clear tube snaking from her bandaged left arm to a plastic bag on a pole , while the monitor next to her bed flickered with a jagged fluorescent green line across a gray screen . The dancing line and the sheet rising and falling indicated she was alive , although he 'd heard that machines could cause certain motions of life , like breathing , to continue after a person was effectively dead . Between the baby-blue tubes across her upper lip and the white bandages around her head her closed eyelids were as stationary as marble . None of the tiny flickerings of life he 'd seen when she was unconscious at the hermitage , after he 'd carried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . The steady pumping of her chest up and down made her seem an extension of the machines around her . " Forgive me , " he whispered . Back in the darkness of his motel room he prayed , " Please do n't let her die . " He promised that if she recovered he would then leave Nevada and go to a monastery where he would dedicate the rest of his life to cloistered prayer and work . He would gladly sacrifice his life for hers . He prayed , " Let me die rather than her . " He awoke unable to breathe ; something pressed down hard on his breastbone . A dark shape flew from his chest up to the corner of the room , disappearing as his eyes focused . He gasped for air , eyes wide open for fear that whatever sat on his chest would return if he closed them . He walked back to the hospital the next evening , and each evening for the rest of the week . No change marked the rhythmic movement of Amy 's chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagued by nightmares as he was night after night , or if she sensed his presence when he whispered into her ear his wish for her to live . The flickering green line on the screen indicated her brain was surging with electrical pulses . He wondered if her mind screamed to awaken from this darkness or if she felt awake but buried alive in her own skull , screaming for help when no one could hear , all the time wishing she could die . How could he help her ? What could he do ? He could n't pray that night . He lay in bed , his will paralyzed ,  | afraid to sleep . In the next room someone changed stations on a radio ; snatches of unidentifiable music , voices , bleeps , and static wormed through the wall . The man on the other side of the wall hummed as he turned up the volume . Brother S heard a clash of thunder in the background of the song , then the sound of rain , and a sorrowful singer straining his voice to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing that raindrops , so many raindrops , must be falling from his eyes , because a man ai n't supposed to cry , and instantly , Brother S was a boy again , on his uncle 's farm , listening to the radio on a summer night as he lay alone in the porch hammock , and the grief he felt for Amy , the sense of loss he felt on leaving the hermitage , the despair he felt for the shattered lives of Amy 's parents , her sister , St. Ed , Straightgut , Pete , and all the monks at the hermitage surged through the distant , sad song about teardrops raining from a man 's eyes . The next evening , Dr. Pinsky wrote something onto a metal clipboard , which he then hung back on Amy 's bed frame . " Every-thing 's out of our hands , " he said . " She 's a very sick girl . Only time will tell . " That night Brother S was relieved when the man in the next room returned sometime after 2 A.M. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices with their intense pangs of loss and love spoke to him in an occult way ; for a few moments he did n't feel entirely alone . The songs , he realized , made the memory of Amy more real to him than her presence in the hospital , for as long as her voice was gone , she was gone . When he went to the hospital , her body was there , her face , her arms , her legs , her heart , her lungs ? everything a person could see or sense ? but Amy herself was not there . Where did a human voice go after death ? Did it flee the tongue with the soul , leaving behind its temporary house of bones and flesh ? Or was the voice the soul , able to float free of all its worldly encumberments ? When someone broke a compact disc into pieces , where did the voice on that disc go ? And who would want to survive as a soul without a voice ? He could n't believe Amy 's voice was . any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of his dead father . Where had he gone ? He remembered his fright as a kid when he 'd heard that people were mostly atoms of ' empty space . His physics teacher had said , squeeze all  | the empty space and energy out of people , crush them and their cars down to bare matter , and ? reduced only to matter ? all the people and all the cars in the world would fit easily on the head of a pencil eraser . A coolness came into his chest . The radio in the other room was silent . He waited for the bat-faced demon he sensed grinning in the dark corner of the room to clutch his heart . The next night as he left the intensive care unit he saw Amy 's mother and sister coming toward him . He put his head down and slid along the wall , but Amy 's mother , with her gaunt , grief-torn face , her sad orange wig , turned on him . " You killed my baby , " she sobbed . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing him with St. Ed , the one who had foolishly led her daughter into a situation where anyone in his right mind would 've known she was likely to get hurt . He wanted to say that he loved her daughter , that he 'd tried to protect her , but then Amy 's sister , Debbie , also turned on him , anticipating his protest , showing there was no mistake in their minds at all . " I told Amy you were all women-haters , " she said . Stunned , he stood alone in the corridor near the small intensivecare waiting room . Dr. Pinsky appeared and said , " Why do n't you go home ? I despise waiting-room potatoes . Get on with your own life . " That night the demon showed its grinning face to him . He could no longer pray . He could no longer read . Trying to look into his copy of The Cloud of Unknowing , which lay on top of the motel 's Gideon Bible next to the lamp on the night table , he glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the dim light : " And so to stand firmly and avoid pitfalls , keep to the path you are on . Let your longing relentlessly beat upon the cloud of unknowing that lies between you and your God . Pierce that cloud with the keen shaft of your love , spurn the thought of anything less than God , and do not give up this work for anything . For the contemplative work of love by itself will eventually heal you of all the roots of sin . " The words meant no more to him than those on the slips of . paper he found in the fortune cookies inside the bags of his take out orders . To stand firmly and avoid pitfalls , keep to the path you are on .  | What path ? Words , prayers , drained of their regenerative efficacy , meant nothing as he sank into the same vacuum of weeks earlier when in the enervating grip of the noonday demon . This time , with God so absent , he had n't even the energy to feel sorry for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life sounded like a sad joke . What life ? The accusations Amy 's mother and sister had flung at him seemed bitterly unjust . Could n't they see that he loved Amy ? Why else would he continue his agonizing vigil for her night after night ? Yet if their accusations were false , why had n't he actually done something earlier to stop St. Ed and protect Amy ? St. Ed 's wish to bring someone as sick as Straightgut into the hermitage now appeared so nutty that his own silent compliance merely indicated how far he himself had slid off the deep end . Surely St. Ed never would 've taken Amy to Straightgut 's dugout unless , on some level , he 'd wanted her hurt . Either that or the man was deluded beyond belief . He could almost hear St. Ed laugh at him and say : " Look who 's talking , you finger-pointing lout . Who brought the dame into the hermitage in the first place ? The world did n't break in , you brought her in , and then you fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good a word for you . You lay around lusting after her , but you were too scared to do anything about it . Now , like a sorehead , you 're trying to shift all the blame . " The demon of despair came and sat on his heart . It was true . After bringing Amy into the hermitage , he was the one who took her bleeding fingers into his mouth , fondled her undergarments , spied on her while she sunbathed , lay next to her through the long night after Jerry had beaten him up , thought of her day and night , touched her soft breast , wished her to vent his lust , tearing her clothes from her , having his way with her , then ? his desires frustrated ? wishing her dead . Now she was almost dead . Who was he to blame St. Ed ? He lay on the bed and realized that Amy was not as dead as he was . With nowhere to go , he took account of his money . He had less than enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimped on food and drank only water . He could n't help Amy if he became completely destitute . Nathan Spock had offered to find him a job if he ever left the hermitage , but he dreaded involving him-  | self with Spock . Yet he had nowhere else to turn . He did n't even have enough money to leave Las Vegas and search for another monastery , even if he had the desire . The TV card listed " Nevada People " on Saturday afternoon . He picked up the motel phone , discovering from the unsurprised clerk that it was Thursday . The time was 10:45 P.M. He plugged in the digital clock , and two days later at 4 P.M. turned on the television . Nathan Spock 's guests were a woman and two men from the Human Interference Task Force , whose job was to prevent human interference with the Shoshone Mountain Nuclear Waste Dump for the next ten thousand years . " Burying nuclear waste is one thing , " the HITF team leader said , " but coming up with an effective marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of mankind . " For models , the task force team had studied monuments from the past : the pyramids of Egypt , Stonehenge in England , the Nazca lines in Peru , the Serpent Mound in Ohio , the Acropolis in Greece , and the Great Wall of China . " So right here in Nevada , " Nathan Spock interjected , his reptilian eyes widening , " you 're building the equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids . " Brother S watched for some sign of decency in Nathan Spock , some reason for trust . " More than that , " responded the young woman , who served as the team 's primary historian . " The pyramids of the great pharaohs have lasted only five thousand years . Now acid rain is destroying them . Our task is to build a marking system that will survive for at least ten thousand years . " Brother S watched in disbelief as the HITF historian held up to the camera a pictorial sequence from the Egyptian tomb of Djehutyhetep that showed people transporting a statue to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , was evident in this scene from a 3,800-year-old tomb because it was still understandable to those who could not read the Egyptian hieroglyphics around it . " But we should not overlook or downplay the potential for language as a vehicle for conveying information , " the HUT leader said . " Warnings will he engraved in stone using pictures , signs , and symbols as well as the six languages of the United Nations :  | English , French , Arabic , Spanish , Russian , and Chinese . Most Americans today ca n't read English as it was written six hundred years ago in the time of Chaucer , and only a few scholars can read English of thirteen hundred years ago as written in Beowulf . Ten thousand years from now English will be a dead , dead language . We ca n't control that . But the duplication of languages will increase the possibility that at least one of the languages will be readable by future scholars . We 're obviously modeling our method on the Egyptian Rosetta Stone . " " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan Spock interjected . " We 're proud of that . The pyramids are Egypt 's great gift to world civilization . " Nathan smiled as though the HITF leader had fallen into a trap . " Some would say that Egypt 's greatest contribution to the world is monasticism . After all , the pharaohs are dead , and monasticism lives . " " But we 're talking about something much older than monasticism , Mr. Spock . We 're talking about Ancient Egypt and the kind of faith that builds monuments that survive . " Nathan 's respectful reference to monasticism surprised and gratified Brother S. He sensed that Nathan 's allusion to monasticism was more than a rhetorical ploy . He seemed to mean what he said , as though he were delivering to Brother S an occult message from a greater power . Nathan Spock 's tongue flicked between his teeth and his eyes narrowed to slits as he said , " All these ancient works and monuments had some religious significance . What you 're building is a monument to nuclear decay and death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After you peel back the veneer from civilization , what else is there ? What do you find at the heart of the pyramids except death and decay ? " When Brother S turned off the television , he remembered St. Ed saying that the vainglory of monuments like the pyramids was exactly what the desert fathers had repudiated by their ascetic life in the . desert . Yet the repository monuments were the only things in the tinned States that might still he around ten thousand years from now . How desperately Amy had wanted to stop that accumulating legacy of death.Before she had been shot , she  | planned to search the test site for the corpses of wild horses . She now believed Jerry had killed them for the DOE . If they could show that the DOE was clearing out the horses because of the waste dump , they might have a case for stopping the nuke roads , at least temporarily . How flimsy her plans now seemed compared to these monumental designs for rivaling the pyramids of the great pharaohs . Confronted with a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , an individual might consider it a feat just to survive from day to day . The motel manager pounded on his door . " You owe for another week , " she said . Brother S pulled the last bills from his wallet . " I do n't have quite enough . " The leathery old woman counted the money . " This is enough for four more nights . I 'm sorry . I ca n't give you credit . After that , you 're going to have to leave . " Brother S was left with an empty wallet and some change in his pocket . He stared at the phone . He had no choice . He called KLAV-TV and asked for Nathan Spock . He was told that Nathan was n't in ? the show he 'd just seen had been taped . He left his name and number . Two days later , on Monday , his phone rang . It was Nathan . He would pick him up that evening . " I knew you 'd call , " Nathan said . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing neon zipped across Nathan 's face as he expressed wonderment that Brother S had n't been downtown to see any of the shows or visit any of the casinos since his arrival in Las Vegas . " Hey , let 's get a meal and have some fun , " he said . Nathan suggested going to the Golden Steer for some nice juicy prime rib , but Brother S demurred , remembering Brother Luke 's death . They settled on an all-you-can-eat buffet at a casino where Nathan had been given passes for two free meals by the bookie . The buffet , so glamorously advertised outside in neon , struck Brother S as an oversized cafeteria with a magnified cafeteria drabness as hundreds of people snaked past globs of food in stainless steel containers on steam tables . He felt as though he 'd arrived at a party that was almost over . Back on the Strip , Nathan drove under the enormous flickering marquee of the Pleasure Dome advertising " HOT ! HOT ! " where  | the outline of a cute dancing devil , tall as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bouncing bare bottom . " This year marks the apotheosis of the ass in Las Vegas , " Nathan said . " All the shows are trying to outdo HOT ! HOT ! ' Asses , asses , that 's all you see . Whatever happened to boobs ? " Brother S remembered the tight white pants Amy 's sister had worn as she had passed through the chapel doors during the Feast of Transfiguration . Nathan suggested going to a real old-fashioned strip show where the girls took it all off , not these placid casino shows where all the showgirls looked like airbrushed plastic dolls . " Listen , you need to learn how to live again . " Nathan ignored Brother S 's objections . " If you 're gon na work in this town , you got ta play in it too . " They had discussed the possibilities of a job for Brother S over dinner . " You 've been through hell out in that damn hermitage . Do n't get me wrong , I have the highest respect for real monasteries and monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy 's tragedy , as far as he was concerned , was terribly , terribly sad , but inevitable . " St. Ed was taking you all off the deep end . " No , he responded to Brother S 's question , Straightgut , as far as he knew , had not yet been captured . " How 're you going to track down a desert rat like that ? " Nathan said . " He 's probably holed up in a cave somewhere . It 'll take months before they sniff him out , but they 'll get him . " Nathan drove to a club north of the Strip , not far from Brother S 's motel . " I do n't want to work in a place like this , " Brother S said . " You wo n't have to , if you let me handle things . Trust me . " The elderly , gray-haired woman behind the cashier window knew Nathan , as did the bouncer , wearing a tight red polo shirt and slicked-back hair , who escorted them to front-row seats along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience like a fashion-show runway . On stage an old comedian in a rumpled tuxedo stood in front of a floor microphone and grabbed his crotch with his right hand as he watched Nathan tip the bouncer and take a seat next to Brother S. " Hey , Nathan , " the comedian called out , " you 've brought the boy to the right spot . " He jiggled his crotch . " We 're all queers in here . " A few people in the crowd laughed . Brother S did n't get the joke . A tall waitress in a black bikini and fishnet stockings bent  | over to put two napkins in front of him . He felt her hip press against his shoulder . He wanted nothing , but Nathan ordered gin and tonics . The waitress returned to put four drinks with red swizzles on the napkins . She smelled like musky lavender . Nathan leaned toward him . " Two drink minimum , " he said . " Those are yours . " A woman 's throaty voice amplified through the room , announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Nukey Babes in last year 's Girls of the Nuclear Test Site . " That voice remind you of anyone ? " Nathan shouted over the loud rock music . Brother S glanced at a woman with frizzy hair behind an elevated glass booth towards the back of the room and shook his head . " Come on , " Nathan said . " That voice is a dead ringer for Amy 's . That 's the kind of voice that goes places in this town . " A blonde danced out in red hot pants and a short red tank top that left her stomach bare . She bounced her hips up and down in rhythm to the screeching music while a flashing red strobe light accelerated her jerky movements as if in an old sixteen-millimeter home movie . Naked girl after naked girl danced in the smoky , red-tinted light . " Come on , boys , get those tips up . There 's no telling what these girls might do . " In that moment , the woman 's voice , in its teasing lilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big cigar and grinned wildly as he waved a creased five-dollar bill between his knuckles . A smiling woman with large bare breasts and a silver-spangled G-string squatted in front of Nathan as he slowly and carefully tucked the bill into the sequined diaper covering her crotch . The squatting woman leaned forward and rapidly jiggled the dark tips of her breasts against Nathan 's smiling face . Perspiration ran over the top of Brother S 's eyelids , blurring his vision . The music got louder and louder as each new dancer became more risque . He felt cold all over . Under the flickering red strobe light the women looked made of plastic . Even the girls ' crotches seemed pasted on . With Amy now dying in intensive care , it was a desecration for him to he here . All this womanly  | flesh , surrounding him , overwhelming him ; perhaps this was a hellish glimpse of what Satan had planned for him : to be incessantly engulfed in those temptations that had once fired his desire and not to care , to lack all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm leaving . " " Wait for this next one , " Nathan said . " She 's a cutey . " He started to stand up , but Nathan grabbed his arm . " Look , " Nathan shouted . " For Christ 's sake , look , man . " For a moment he thought he saw Amy in front of him , with her bright white smile and glinting , almond-shaped eyes , but it was Amy 's sister , Debbie ? he was sure of it ? though she 'd been introduced as Juanita , a former winner of Amateur Night ? squirting white cream from a blue plastic bottle on her naked body as she danced . She smeared the oily cream all over herself . Dollar bills stuck to her breasts , her hips , her stomach as she scooped them from the runway and slapped them against her wet skin . The naked girl danced close to his face and turned her back to him ; her damp buttocks fluttered up and down as she rapidly flexed her muscles . Nathan had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it stood like a little green tent on the edge of the runway . Her buttocks still jiggling , Debbie ? or the dancer who looked like Debbie ? slowly spread her legs and gradually leaned forward so that her long curly hair first dropped into sight between her legs , then her face , upside down , appeared just below the rosy dot that came into view as her quivering buttocks spread fully apart . She smiled at Brother S , picked up the five-dollar bill , and blew him a kiss with it , her lips mouthing , unheard through the blaring rock music , the words , " Fuck you . " Her nostrils flared and her teeth looked like fangs . He awoke in his darkened room , the heavy drapes drawn , the phone ringing . Nathan said he would call as soon as he had news of a job . But he had no energy to reach for the phone or to get up from the bed . He tried to shake from his mind the image of Nathan sitting with his chair tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winking at naked women who danced just beyond his reach .  | When he finally managed to go out for some food the next day , he spent the last of his change except for thirty-six cents . Nathan had tried to push some money on him , but he 'd refused . The next day he was thinking of what thirty-six cents could buy when the phone rang again . After thirteen rings it stopped . He tried leaving the phone off the hook , but a surprisingly loud operator 's voice ordered him through the disconnected receiver to put the phone back on the hook , and he obeyed . He had one day left before he 'd either have to leave the motel or pay for another week . He lay listlessly on his bed when someone pounded on the door , and a woman 's voice , vaguely familiar , shouted , " Hello , hello in there . Open up , or I 'll get the master key . " He pulled the door open a crack ; someone pushed it hard against him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hermitage . He almost expected St. Ed to appear behind her , but Rose , wearing a gossamer India print sundress , loosely attached to her bare shoulders with two spaghetti-thin straps , was alone . The door slammed behind her . Her face flushed from the heat , she sat on the unmade bed as though to prevent him from returning there . Bunching loose folds of her cotton dress above her knees , she bared her legs , damp with perspiration , to the cooling drafts of the air conditioner . He backed away from her , taking the sole chair in the room , a cheap , plastic-covered lounge chair next to the blank green eye of the television set . " Nathan told me you were here , " Rose said , her dark eyes scanning the room . " Come on , get a shirt on . He has a job for you . " She bounced up from the bed . " How can you stand this dump ? " She pulled the strings of the dark drapes . The curtains flung apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glaring whiteness , too bright to see , as radiant streams of sunlight flowed through the dirty glass , lighting even the shadowy corners . " Come on , " she said . " You need something to eat . " Sitting across from her a few minutes later in a bright coffee shop down the street from the motel , busy with sounds of a noonday crowd eating lunch , he listened to how , like him , she 'd left the hermitage . " Things are a mess out there , " she said . They drank iced tea with lemon and ate crisp green salads with olives and  | tomatoes . Rose held her head high , like a dancer , and her dark hair rolled back in a bun accentuated her long neck . Some loose strands of dark hair flared from her temples . " Nathan has been trying to reach you for days , " she said . " I told him I 'd come and get you . " She was back working at the television station , she said , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashram in Oregon . " I 'm sorry it did n't work out at the hermitage , but after Amy got shot and you left , things fell apart . Even before that , I knew I 'd made a mistake . It was too narrowly Christian for me . " She pulled from a paper bag with the name of a bookstore printed on it a new translation of the Te-Tao Ching . " I like reading the Christian mystics , but the eastern texts speak more to me . For all his talk , St. Ed was n't open enough to eastern spirituality . " The reason , Brother S knew , was that St. Ed believed Christianity offered a more profound sense of evil than other religions ; that was Christianity 's attraction to the Greek Stoics . Evil was not just the absence of good , but an act of human agency , like the shooting of Amy . " No , " Rose said in response to his question about Straightgut , " they have n't found him yet . Some of the locals are disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend was getting up a vigilante group to go look for him . " " None of this would 've happened if we 'd stayed hermit monks , but St. Ed had to be an activist and ruin everything . " " He did n't ruin it . The DOE did with their nuclear waste dump . " " That damn Shoshone Mountain ! I hate it ! If Amy had n't been out there looking for those poisoned horses , she never would 've come to the hermitage . " " And she never would 've been shot . But she was , and she needs help . She lost her insurance when the BLM fired her . Her bills are going to be astronomical . Her sister 's trying to help by dancing at some club . " " I know . I saw her . It was terrible . " " So help her out . Nathan has a nightfly spot for you at a radio station . " " I do n't want to work for Nathan . " Rose put a comforting hand on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " but you 're not doing Amy or yourself any good in that grubby motel . Nathan has a job for you , and you 'd better take it . Now 's no time to be feeling sorry for yourself . " " I do n't know anything about radio . " " Nathan says you 've got the voice . You can learn the technical stuff . You 've got mechanical skills , so it wo n't be that hard . I 've done it myself " She explained that the current disc jockey on the graveyard shift was leaving the station , and the person hired to replace him had backed out unexpectedly . " It seems providential , " Rose said . " Nathan has a lot of years ' experience judging talent . People in this town respect his opinion . That 's why if he says you 'd bring a great voice to radio , people believe him . " " And then it 's over , " Brother S replied . " I 'm no longer a monk . " Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed 's still fighting , " she said . " He 's set up a hospital fund for Amy in Warm Springs . I think he really loved her . " Brother S felt his face grow hot . " Loved her ? His kind of love almost killed her . What kind of love is that ? " " And what kind of love is yours ? You 're doing nothing . " " But I love Amy . " " Then take this job . Do it for her . " With thirty-six cents in his pocket , he could do nothing for Amy . At least if he kept his body alive he might help in some way . That afternoon he returned to his room and lay on top of his bed , his yellow duffle packed , the drapes redrawn but leaving a crack of light where the curtains met . Rose 's words made him realize how much harm he 'd done . To Amy 's impending death he 'd only added more death , abandoning the hermitage and leaving the dogs , the bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . For weeks , entombed in the motel , he 'd let his body drift toward the death that had already claimed his spirit . When the phone rang , he watched his right arm , so long dead , move with a vigor he hoped might soon return to his darkened soul . After Nathan 's instructions had buzzed in his ear , he tossed the room key , attached to a piece of orange plastic shaped like a teardrop , onto the night table and left the motel .  | After the Way is lost , we have kindness ; after kindness is lost , we have justice ; after justice is lost , we have social order and control , the thinning out of loyalty and honesty of heart , and the beginning of chaos . ? Lao-tzu , Te-Tao Ching , 38:7-11 Day after day St. Ed stared helplessly at the devastation . Under the late September sun the wheat field blackened . A white crust appeared on the irrigation ditches , the last crops in the garden wilted , vegetable leaves darkened and curled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heat scorched the tightening membranes in his nose as though he were breathing cin-ders . Ralph and Teddy came to him , their faces leprous white , the rims of their eyes pink , saying they could stay no longer . Ralph would return to Berkeley and Teddy to Massachusetts . Ralph reached up to his thinning hair ? much of it lost , he 'd admitted , during days of drug taking and poor nutrition ? and pulled out a pale tuft with his fingers . His eyes looked terrified . St. Ed remembered the dry yellow rain of radioactive dust that had fallen , so terribly , so ironically , on August sixth , the Feast of the Transfiguration ; yet nuclear ventings had occurred before without such disastrous consequences . The mysteriousness of what was happening frightened them all . He drove the boys to'limopah and gave them money for food  | and bus tickets to Las Vegas . It was the best he could do . His funds , reduced by Brother S 's theft , were diminishing . Teddy would have to earn some money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the cheeks . Teddy hugged him and sobbed . " Peace be with you , " he told them . " If you can ever come back , I 'll be here . Do n't lose the way . " Despite his smile and assurance to the two boys , he did n't know how much longer he could hold out . Without Brother S and Amy , he 'd fought to hold the hermitage together , for a time , with the help of Rose , who 'd rallied valiantly after Amy was shot . Although he 'd initially disapproved of Rose 's blurring of religious traditions ? she facilely plugged quotations from Lao-tzu or Teresa of Avila or whomever into any context that momentarily suited her ? she had an enthusiasm and energy that helped them all stick together as a group through their grieving for Amy . When Rose left , a spark went out of the men . Now that Teddy and Ralph were gone , only Pete remained . " You can leave , too , " he told Pete . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm staying , " he said . " The rest is in divine hands . " " Then I 'm staying , too , " Pete said . He tried to resuscitate the dying gardens with daily irrigation , but the last of the plants withered and blackened . Dry squash vines , squeezed between his fingers to test for moisture , crumbled apart like ashes . Even weeds near the gardens cracked like dead straw beneath the soles of his sandals . Thousands of bees , abandoning their hives , swarmed through the hermitage like electrical charges . With books he 'd gotten from the Tonopah library , St. Ed studied about bees at night . He leafed through the notebooks in which Brother S had kept careful records of each hive , its honey production , and its times of medication , feeding , and requeening . Such frequent swarming , he read , was an aberration for that time of year . Zipped into Brother S 's bee coveralls , he pried up the cover of a hive and puffed smoke into it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in the hive , and the frames contained nearly no honey , the wax caps of the cells torn raggedly open . On the floor of the hive dying bees lay in a powdery beeswax , their wings trembling , unable to fly . Ants and roaches scurried among the
