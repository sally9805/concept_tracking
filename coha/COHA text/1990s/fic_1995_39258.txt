Traveling alone , Martin Grant came to a place on the coast in the rain . A place much as he had imagined  --  green and balmy , with bright splashes of winter flowers and fruit trees and tall palms that rustled in the wind . A place so far from the frozen cornfields of central Iowa that it made him smile , and imagine that his memories of what had happened there might one day melt and evaporate in this subtropical air . <p> The job he had been offered  --  on the basis of an editing test , two phone interviews , and several strong recommendations  --  was that of city editor for a mid-sized daily . It was a lateral move , at best , although these days Martin Grant was less interested in advancement than he was in change . He needed , at age forty , a new headline in his life . <p> The sights and sounds and smells of newspapers being made varied little , he had found , and as he toured the building , Martin caught glints everywhere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a quiet and affable manner that plugged in easily to this new job . His only difficulty during those first several days was one of will : maintaining the faith that had kept him sober for more than two months . <p> Each afternoon , as Martin set up the next morning 's Metro section , the urge to drink at times dazzled him , like the sun sequins that glittered on the green , palm-lined bay outside the newsroom window , and quickly dimmed . In the evenings , he took walks to quiet this craving , making paths from the plush townhouse the publisher had found him , marveling at the lush neighborhoods full of moss-draped oaks and banana magnolias , where air conditioners hummed and birds sang and lawn sprinklers clicked in the Bermuda grass . He thought , during these walks , of his wife , Katie , knowing that she had a warm fire of vodka going inside her , and that she was happy with this new man she had found in snowy Iowa , who liked bourbon , with beer chasers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish roofs , interiors seemed to sharpen , like Polaroid pictures ; the scenes of people sitting around dinner tables and in living rooms on these warm December evenings seemed not quite real to Martin , like the mechanical figures he had seen on his only other trip to Florida , at Disney World . <p> Nearly everyone at the newspaper , Martin found , had also come to this town from somewhere else , and they quickly made him feel welcome . Thomas Persons , a florid-faced political columnist from Wisconsin , with wispy curls of white hair , sat closest to Martin 's office , and informed him , on his third day , " You know , Grant , I have to tell you , you 're a far better editor than the monkey they had in here before . " Lora Lee Moonshower , a tiny Pennsylvanian from the production department , with remarkable posture and wavy brown hair that reached to the backs of her knees , introduced herself on Martin 's first day and let her eyes flirt with his . She wore tight jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpent tattooed on one arm . Martin was cheerful , and she returned several times over the next few days , sitting on the edge of his desk and swinging her leg , as if they were courting . <p> But it was n't until China Rinaldi invited him for dinner that Martin Grant felt anything had happened  --  that there was some news in his life , and , thus , that his new life in this new town had begun . Nothing about China Rinaldi glinted quite the way he expected . She looked to him more like a fashion model than the advertising director , tall and slender with long legs and black hair and an alluring upward tug at the corners of her mouth . Yet a fashion model would n't possess such earthy politeness . He was surprised by other things : to discover , after their first conversation , that her geniality echoed so hollowly off several other staff members . That some in the newsroom , in their rush to deadline , seemed to step around China when she came in with her odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were some exotic creature they had gotten used to and , then , tired of . It surprised him when she grabbed his arm one morning in the hallway , feigned a laugh , and said , conspiratorially , " This fricking place , " without explaining . The " Let Go Let God " sticker on the back of her red Mustang was another twist ; as was her remark , " You know what my favorite activity is ? Painting . " What surprised Martin most , though , was when , on his fifth day in town , China Rinaldi used the ease of their shared politeness to say : " It must be tough moving to a new place and not knowing anybody . Why do n't you come over tonight and I 'll make you some supper ? " <p> She lived six blocks from Martin 's townhouse , so he decided to walk , enjoying the cooling breezes as lightning bugs began to glow in the live oaks . The apartment was on a canal , in a development called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited , and tried again . <p> Moonlight shifted in the tops of the tall , bent coconut palms ; he wondered how it looked right now in Iowa , shining . out across the fields of snow behind the farmhouse where Katie was living . <p> " Welcome ! " <p> China , in the doorway with a wineglass raised , seemed to be toasting him . <p> " Greetings , " he replied . <p> The apartment 's smell was warm and spicy , of seafood and bay leaf and burning incense ; it drew him in , through the vestibule and the hallway to the main room , where candlelight cast jumping shadows on the walls and wicker furniture . He saw , as they stood beside the dining room table , smiling at each other , that she had dressed up slightly , in a low-cut black caftan , while he had dressed down , changing from a suit to khakis and a sport shirt . A gold chain and small cross hung between her breasts . <p> " Very nice , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her right hand in the " Stop " position , like Diana Ross . <p> " Please , " she said . " Stay right there . " <p> Martin wondered , as she set her glass on the kitchen counter and hurried to an adjoining bedroom , if she was going to take his picture . <p> He saw television images changing on the dark bedroom walls through the door , and then she was back . <p> " These , " she announced proudly , her hands on the backs of two small children , " are the famous munchkins . " <p> " The pleasure 's mine , " Martin said , gazing at eyes glazed with TV images . <p> " This "  --  she placed her right hand on the head of a sullen , tousle-haired boy , who immediately tried to wriggle free  --  " is Jamie . And this "  --  the other hand rested on hair that was silky and black , like China 's  --  " is Justine . This is Mr. Martin . " <p> Justine went behind her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jamie looked down , as if he had done something wrong . <p> " Mr. Martin just moved here from Iowa . Iowa ? Or Idaho ? " <p> " Iowa , " Martin said . <p> As soon as she let go and lifted her glass  --  again , oddly , in the gesture of a toast  --  the children hurried to the bedroom . <p> " Wine ? " she said . <p> Her brown eyes seemed to moisten with the reflection of the candle flame . Martin saw colored lights on the boles of the coconut palms by the swimming pool . He conjured up his number and held on , as if to a talisman in his pocket , a winning lottery ticket in his hand : sixty-seven days . " I 'll have soda , " he said . " If you have any . " <p> Her seafood marinara was thick with Gulf shrimp and clams and scallops , spicy with basil and onion . They talked easily across the table , with the same ping-pong of politeness they had played in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and careers in capsule summaries . And then , after dishing him a second helping of marinara , China began to reveal , matter-of-factly , the secrets of the men and women Martin was getting to know . <p> " I see Tom Persons in your office all the time . He 's a very nice man . But I feel sorry for him . Did you know he 's been married four times , and has his salary attached ? " <p> Martin 's eyes grew larger . " Is that right ? " <p> She raised and lowered her head , with a flat , knowing smile . " Drinking . " <p> There was more : Lora Lee Moonshower was arrested last year for shoplifting frozen french fries in the Winn-Dixie ; Hobart Brice , the sports editor , enjoyed young boys in his Saab , and was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy , again ; the art director was having an affair with the entertainment editor , and both were married women . <p> " Sounds livelier than I 'd have imagined , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Are you kidding ? " A faint mustache of 7-Up shone below her straight , perfect nose as she shook her head , leaning toward the candlelight . " I quit once before . Six months ago . Fricking Elmer did n't know what to do . He said , ' Listen , China , what would you want to go and do that for ? ' I think he likes me . " The corners of her mouth curled momentarily . Elmer , Martin realized , must be Peter Fudd , the managing editor . " And I said , ' I have to look out for the munchkins . ' My children . Which is true . He says , ' Let me see what I can do . ' <p> " So he goes down the hall , right ? Closes his office door , comes back twenty minutes later , makes me an offer . I say , ' That 's almost what they 're offering me at this other job '  --  of course , he thinks it 's the other newspaper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divulge just where it is . And , sure enough , he comes back the next day , I 'm starting to pack my things in a box . Like , a big cardboard box ? " She moved her hands as if shoveling sand into a bucket . " Elmer comes up and offers what I want . Asks me if I want to be ad director . " <p> Martin chuckled politely . " Guess that did n't sit too well with the previous ad director , " he said . <p> China 's eyes flickered ; he saw an earlier version of her gaze momentarily , dark and vulnerable . " Well . I mean , I do n't like to operate that way . But that 's how the world works . " <p> The telephone rang . China looked at Martin as if her stomach had growled . " Excuse me . " <p> He heard her answer in the kitchen  --  " Yes ? " she said , suspiciously . She turned her back to him , blocking the view of the wine bottle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swimming pool , it had begun to rain . As clearly as he remembered Katie 's little half-cough , he recalled the sound of vodka pouring into her glass in late afternoon , followed by the softer splash of orange juice , and the way it looked in the morning on the bed-stand , the color of thin urine . He wondered if the man , the antiques dealer , had awakened this morning to that smell . <p> Without saying another word , China replaced the telephone receiver in its cradle , so delicately he did n't hear it . <p> " So . " She sat at the table and laced her fingers together . Martin saw a new energy on the edges of her eyes . She licked her lips once . " I understand you 're going through a divorce . " <p> " Yes , " Martin said . " I am . " His thoughts stuck , though ; the events were still like notes in his mind , stories to write . " Thirteen years , " he said . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew apart . It was very hard for me to stay in the same town , the way things turned out . " He added , " Drinking had a lot to do with it . " <p> China looked to the side and blinked at unseen thoughts . The long lashes made her seem far away . <p> " I was married to a very abusive man , " she said . " There was no growing apart , it was more like a shattering . A series of shatterings . " Her face went blank for a moment , like a television that is turned off and quickly on again . " I came down here from New York to start over , because my sister was here . And , of course , <p> did n't want the munchkins to be near their father . But I 've been here four years now , and nothing 's happened . I think we 've had enough of this fricking place . " <p> " Where would you go ? " he said , holding his fork above the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really thought about it . He saw the reflection of the candles across the room in the sliding glass door and burning absently in her eyes . She looked back at her food , and they finished the meal talking easily about the news of the town and the people at the office . Together they cleared the table . <p> As she excused herself , to put the children to bed , Martin admired the easy way her hips moved leaving the room . He saw three canvases leaning against a wall by the bookcase , and crouched to look . All were signed " China " in childlike black print . One was of a crumbling barn , with withered fields of corn in the background ; it might have been Iowa , the land behind the man 's farmhouse in late June . Another was of a sailboat , tilted dangerously on a bright blue sea . The third was of four men disembarking from a train , grim-faced , onto a flat brown terrain , as a storm gathered in the sky behind them . It awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time  --  fourteen years ago , in the gravel parking lot at St. Matthew 's church on West Street in Cedar Rapids  --  but of what happened beforehand . These were the same expressions he had seen in that church , worn by the older neighbor men he had known for years . As the congregation prayed , kneeling , he had glanced across and suddenly not known them , any of them ; it was like looking at a familiar landscape from an unfamiliar vantage point and not recognizing it . The grown-ups prayed , the children fidgeted , and he touched Katie 's arm , watched her freckled face and clear blue eyes ; afterward , without warning , in a wonderful sparkle of spring sunlight through the elm leaves , he kissed her , leaning against the blue Volvo , and it changed their lives . <p> Martin went to the back door and slid it open . A fine warm rain was falling , and the air smelled of wet bark and chlorine and magnolias . A good fresh scent . Something exciting was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , and the green pool lights quivered distantly beneath the rain-dimpled surface . <p> He walked along three stepping stones beside the pool and stopped , hearing her voice . Behind drawn curtains , a partially opened window , China was admonishing her children , in Italian : " Daviola ! Basta ! No ! Basta ! " A door slammed . <p> He stared at the glistening bark and thought of drops on a whiskey glass , the sound of ice , remembering just how the first drink of the day felt , going down . Their troubles had begun as evening arguments , over what she repeatedly called " moving in separate directions . " As Katie , the talkative high school English teacher , drank more , he drank less , and privately winced each time she had to " freshen " hers  --  as if it was really just one great big drink she was having . Seven days ago , he had left her there , still drinking it , he 'd been unable to take it away . As the wind gusted up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronds , he felt something shake loose in himself also . <p> China was standing on one of the stepping stones , staring at him as if he were modern art . <p> " What are you doing ? " she said . " Let 's sit under the awning . " <p> She pushed two plastic pipe chairs together on the terrace right outside of the living room . The candles still glowed inside through the glass . <p> " The munchkins , " she said , " were bad tonight . I think they 're just tired . They 're usually much more sociable . " <p> " I really enjoyed the dinner , " he said , tasting steamed seafood in the air . " I saw your paintings in there . Quite nice . The one of the train  --  " <p> " Fugitives ? " She pushed her hair back over her shoulders , and he saw that her lashes were tipped now with moisture . " It 's my father and his three brothers , actually . They all had that same expression on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed them out about something . My husband had it , too . Although for some reason , I never saw it until after we were married . " <p> " Fugitives . " <p> " That 's what I called it . ' People who travel are always fugitives . ' I was reading Daphne du Maurier at the time . " <p> Martin , wanting to say , " What does that mean ? " instead asked , " Do you believe that ? " <p> " Mmm-hmm . " She seemed to be staring at a memory , just above the redwood fence . " My father moved around , my husband moved around . And , I mean , I tell everybody how fricking awful my husband was . But , I was there , too , was n't I ? I made myself available for it . " <p> He understood then , breathing boiled shrimp in the warm , rain-scented air . Most of the big stories in our lives , regrettably , are n't written by us , he had learned . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 've probably heard some of the things said at the office about me by now , " China said , smiling dimly ; she looked off to the side , a place he could n't see . The cross between her breasts gleamed momentarily with the lights above the swimming pool . <p> " No , " he said . " What things ? " <p> " It does n't matter . " <p> She looked at his face , her brown eyes glowing again around the edges with an urgent energy . <p> Martin smiled back . <p> Her hair felt good on his arm in the wet breeze . <p> Using the same tone with which she might have asked , " Do you want another 7-Up ? " China said , " Do you want to kiss ? " <p> He felt her fingers taking his , and the warmth of her breath in the damp air as she leaned against him . Her lips were sticky at first , and then she pulled away , and her mouth tried different angles . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect jazz riff , and she led him inside , to the bedroom , and pulled him easily onto a thick , clean-smelling quilt , where they held each other , fitting together , as pieces of moonlight slid in drops on the upper window and the shadows of magnolia and jacaranda jockeyed on the walls . She was slender and sinewy , so different from Katie 's softness , wearing a light flowery perfume . They undressed with the ease of conversation and began to kiss again , as if starting over , kissing for a long time as the curtain on the lower window filled with the warm , damp taste of outdoors , then she put him inside her , and as she sat up , he saw her dark eyes watching , not smiling , telling him to follow , to go where she was going . She flattened herself on top of him , touched her hands to his face , and moved , slowly , back and forth , watching , biting him gently on the lips , kissing with her mouth closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned over like one body now , and he began to feel himself returning , going back to places where the breeze spoke of passion and possibilities . He saw her eyes watching , seeing he was with her , and then she closed them , and her face filled for a moment with a private pleasure ; she breathed roughly against his face , pulling his head down as her thighs clenched . He , following , felt for an instant the magic of surrender to the way things really are . When he looked at her afterward , she was staring at him comfortably , her eyes still not smiling . It was the first time , he realized , he had broken his vow . <p> In the morning , shiny fan-shaped palmetto leaves rustled against the screen windows at Martin 's townhouse . The pieces of blue sky were bright , promising , among the oak branches . He woke to tell himself the news , comparing the events at China 's apartment to the kiss in a parking lot fourteen years earlier , a kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door to their marriage and , he supposed , to this . Wind made a steady sound like running water in the trees as he drove through the eight o'clock shadows to his new job , where he would write headlines and edit the news that could be told . It felt good . <p> Above the clicking of keyboards , as morning sun made prisms in ashtrays and pop bottles , Martin heard Q. V. Robertson , the paper 's police reporter , explain what happened : At 7:05 this morning , a seventy-two-year-old tourist had been shot dead in the Holiday Inn parking lot by a seventeen-year-old local boy . The teen , apprehended several blocks away , still carrying the gun , at first denied it . He later claimed the man had provoked him . Martin and Q.V . shook their heads familiarly , sadly . Most criminals , Martin knew , found this instinct early , and carried it through life : insisting innocence , even to themselves , so they never had to look too closely at what they 'd done , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The day began bright , and turned breezy , gray . It surprised him not to see China Rinaldi all morning . <p> Thomas Persons came back from lunch with his vest buttoned wrong and a glow of alcohol on his face . <p> " You missed a good one , " he said , leaning in the doorway . <p> Martin smiled agreeably , remembering the way China 's arms and back and butt had felt , her breath panting against his ear . <p> " Next time , " he said , and winked . <p> Thunderheads moved quickly in the afternoon sky , like hands on a dock , and gusts of wind broke pieces of palm frond off into the parking lot . He looked up frequently from his terminal , from the Metro copy he was editing , out at the newsroom , at the bottle of Jovan musk Q. V. Robertson kept on his desk . Sixty-eight days . <p> When she came in , he had dummied all but the lead story for Metro . The Holiday Inn shooting . They were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Guess what ? " she said , with strained cheer . Martin waited . Her expression would n't meet his . He looked at the newsroom and saw Thomas Persons blinking in at them , as if he 'd just put on new glasses . <p> " You quit ? " <p> She raised and lowered her head . <p> " Why ? " <p> " I told you , " she said . <p> " Two weeks ? " <p> The alluring tug showed briefly in the corners of her mouth , like sun sequins on the bay . " He 's going to give me two weeks ' severance pay , yeah . " With the pleasant tone he 'd heard her use in the newsroom , she said , " I 'd really like to stay friends , " and then he watched her escape , her hips moving with the same ease he had seen the night before , though now in faded jeans . <p> Putting the Metro section to bed , Martin kept looking at the same thoughts : he was glad it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green cursor pulsed on his computer screen . More and more he wanted to pull things back , as miscast fishing lines , but you ca n't ; you can only cast new ones . He finished his work and walked out into the windy air behind the building . Lora Lee Moonshower was smoking a cigarette , staring up into an oak tree as if , maybe , an owl were perched on it . Seeing him , she lost all interest . <p> " Hey ! " <p> " Hi ! " <p> Martin , smiling , narrowed the distance , looking at the trembling trees , feeling something shake loose again , like the leafstalks of the sabal palms . <p> " Strange , is n't it ? " she said . " For this time of year . " <p> Her eyes locked on his with an interest he could n't ignore . He saw in her face life as it was : news . He had to respond . The wind pulled through the trees again , and they both looked up , together , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p>
