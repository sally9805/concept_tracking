They bicker and bond  --  a wise , weary detective ( Morgan Freeman ) in his last week before retirement and an eager kid ( Brad Pitt ) fresh from the country and ready to kick some big-city butt . Police partnerships do n't come any lower concept than this . On the other hand , the serial killer they are pursuing , a creepy , brainy religious fanatic played by Kevin Spacey , is a high-concept kind of guy : he 's trying to commit seven murders in seven days , each of them supposed to illustrate one of the seven deadly sins in some preposterously stomach-churning way . <P> Luckily , the setting for Seven ( the title is the only understated thing about the picture ) is an anonymous metropolis where it rains all the time and no one seems to have paid his light bill . The murk hides some ( but not all ) of the grisly details . Murk is also the auteurial hallmark of director David Fincher ( Alien 3 ) . Aiming to be a modern-day Bosch , he ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well matched to those of first-time screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker , whose range of literary allusions runs from Dante to Chaucer but whose gift for low-genre necessities  --  suspense , jeopardy , snappy dialogue  --  is nonexistent . His big idea is that man is vile and that cities are catch basins for the worst of our fallen breed . He must be very young . <P> The actors , among them Gwyneth Paltrow as the young cop 's wife ( whom we immediately perceive as good , and therefore doomed ) , do their best to ground this twaddle in recognizable behavior . But it is very tiresome peering through the gloom trying to catch a glimpse of something interesting , then having to avert one 's eyes when it turns out to be just another brutally tormented body . <P>  --  R.S.
