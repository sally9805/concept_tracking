Sport-utility vehicles have always been odd automotive beasts . Part miniature truck , part muscled-up car , they have all the amenities of a family sedan and all the gas-gulping bulk of a big rig . Now the SUV will have to do a little downsizing  --  at least when it comes to tailpipe emissions . Last week President Clinton announced new rules requiring SUVs and other so-called light trucks to put out no more pollution than an ordinary car . <P> Until now the Environmental Protection Agency has gone pretty easy on light trucks , allowing them to release between 0.7 gram and 1.5 grams of smog-producing nitrogen oxide per mile , in contrast to 0.3 gram for smaller vehicles . The problem is not just the size of trucks and cars , but also the fuel that powers them . Gasoline contains up to 300 parts per million of sulfur  --  more than enough to foul emission-control devices . Under the new rules , oil refiners must slash that figure to 30 p.p.m . At the same time , automakers must improve the way all vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare 0.07 gram of nitrogen oxide per mile . <P> The changes wo n't come right away  --  the new rules will be phased in slowly between 2004 and 2009  --  and they wo n't come cheap . The EPA estimates that consumers will see a 1cent-to-2cents per gal . price jump at gas pumps and a $250 boost in the price of some SUVs , though oil companies warn that the fuel costs could be higher . But not too high to outweigh the benefit , say environmentalists . It 's time , they contend , for a vehicle that walks like a truck and talks like a truck to begin breathing like a car . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
