<p> Every other week for the past four years , George Taylor has stepped away from his life as a writer to join several other men in evening meetings in their homes . The men - who include an artist , a computer programmer , a house painter , and a jeweler - exchange ideas on everything from current events to challenges in their personal lives . <p> The group has no leaders , and the rules are few : Speak from the heart , respect the views of others . The goal is to share thoughts on their status in a society that they feel offers men few guidelines and little support . <p> " Men are really in turmoil about their roles in society , how to be a parent , how to be connected to community , " says the San Francisco resident . He says men are recognizing the value of a " small , communal process that takes men out of their isolation to begin dealing with these issues . " <p> This quiet meeting , repeated in thousands of places across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " second wave " of the men 's movement . Lampooned in earlier years for being a privileged , " white men only " phenomenon , the movement is maturing . It is reaching out to different racial and age groups and to women , and offering means for social change . <p> " The men 's movement has passed through its ... adolescence and made it to early adulthood , " says John Lee , whose 1988 bestseller , " Flying Boy , " addressed men 's issues . " For the most part , it is more grounded , less attention seeking , and more committed to horizons beyond its own narrow concerns . " <p> The ripening can be seen at places such as Camp JCA Shalom here , where a racially mixed group of 85 men and youths spent a week last month discussing racism and violence . It was evident in a Seattle meeting where an even larger group of men and women spent a weekend last winter discussing means of gender reconciliation . <p> It is also found in the movement 's growing numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that encourages men to observe high moral standards , forge ties with other men , and take greater responsibility for their families - held 13 rallies in 1995 that pulled in half a million men , up from about 4,200 in its early days five years ago . <p> The supersized Promise Keepers meetings have drawn from the ranks of the conventionally religious , particularly evangelicals . They are but one part of what has become a collection of movements that attract men from diverse backgrounds and encourage them to revise their lives in spiritual - if not traditionally religious - terms . <p> As many as 10,000 groups of a dozen or fewer men are meeting informally across the country to compare notes on everything from racism to family life . Men 's groups have taken root in some prisons . Men 's issues forums have sprung up on the Internet , and many bookstores now devote entire shelves to literature on the movement . <p> " The idea of men being willing to open up and get in touch with their feeling and emotional side is beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early feminism that women could seek fulfillment in roles other than wife and mother , " says Bert Hoff , publisher of M.E.N. , a leading men 's magazine . <p> Unlike the women 's movement of the 1960s and ' 70s , the majority of participants operating under the " men 's movement " umbrella have no specific political agenda . Rather , they are examining ways to lead richer , more satisfying lives . " They are not out to change the system so much as they are out to change themselves , " says Mark Muesse , a professor of religious studies at Rhodes College in Memphis . <p> Michael Meade , a scholar of traditional cultures , sees the " second wave " as part of an " eruption " of disparate groups that are social , personal , and spiritual in orientation . " All seem fueled by the hunger to be part of something greater than one 's isolated , modern self , to be in touch with a part of life that represents continuity and purpose , " he says . <p> The phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iron John , " Robert Bly 's bestseller that focused on the need for stronger father-son relationships and decried the lack of rites of passage for boys as they moved toward adulthood . Activist men 's groups had existed for decades . But beginning in the mid-1980s , Mr. Bly , along with Mr. Meade , began holding wilderness retreats designed to help men explore their " neglected " emotional and spiritual lives . <p> " Sadly , many ... men lacked pride in their masculinity , " says Christopher Harding , editor of the men 's quarterly " Wingspan . " " No matter how tough , cool , or jovial they may seem on the outside , inwardly many guys felt a little sheepish ; spiritually and emotionally inferior to women , physically and financially inferior to other men . " <p> " The feminist revolution made us aware of how the economic order has discriminated against women , but not how it has crippled the male psyche , " wrote Sam Keen , in " Fire in the Belly , " another bestseller that struck a chord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines itself with the horizons of work and consumption , is not man in any full sense of the word ... <p> " Especially for men , ours is an outer-directed culture that rewards us for remaining strangers to ourselves , unacquainted with feeling , intuition , " he added . <p> But because the participants in early gatherings were largely middle-aged white men who used drumming and singing in forest settings as a way to express their emotions , the movement quickly became a prime target for criticism . <p> Some dismissed the retreats as woundlicking by a privileged class . Others were dismayed by what they saw as self-indulgent men ignoring those around them while trying to rediscover " lost " masculinity through hugging each other and howling in the woods . <p> " There is much of importance that a man can learn by removing himself from daily concerns to get in touch with himself , " says Michael Kimmel , a sociologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who has been one of the leading critics of the men 's movement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel-goodism rather than a way to reenter society and make substantive social change . " <p> More recently , some feminists have criticized men 's groups , particularly the burgeoning conservative Christian organizations , for what they see as a move by men to assert authority in the family and challenge existing laws on everything from alimony to child-custody . <p> The quantity and intensity of criticism laid the groundwork for redirection in the movement . Partly in response to naysayers - as well as men deterred by the adverse publicity - Meade , Bly , and others began to reach out . They held multicultural retreats alongside ones designed to improve communication between men and women . They broadened the discussion to include ways to work together in communities . <p> Six years ago , for example , Meade and Bly experimented by inviting 50 blacks and 50 whites to a week-long retreat in West Virginia . The two groups examined conflict between the races and voiced profound concerns about themselves and their communities . <p> " There were two days of unmitigated rage , followed by uncompromising reactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After the first two days , any sane observer would have said , ' They 'll be packing soon . ' " But , Meade adds , halfway through the week , the tone began to change . " Something else began to enter ... what I call a deep level of brotherhood that can acknowledge differences but can also reach past them to where men can be touched by them . " <p> Onaje Benjamin , a black political activist from Kannapolis , N.C. , who attended the meeting , says that " I felt that white American men had finally gone beyond singing and dancing at retreats to deal with real issues in the community . It was one of the most powerful events of my life because it showed me there was a place that men of different races could meet beyond their rage . " <p> Some men , however , have not entirely welcomed the broadening of the movement . After his second conference for both men and women in Mendocino , Calif. , businessman Dave Brumer , a veteran of several men-only retreats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicultural event added a level of complexity that made it hard to deal with . " <p> But others have reacted more positively . " Something cracked open in me by finding that men of all ages and colors were wrestling with the same things I am , " says Rico Hinojosa , a Hispanic ex-convict who participated in the Los Angeles event . <p> Beside the daily group discussions among men of all ages , Mr. Hinojosa says he learned to start trusting men of other races through various workshops . <p> Another participant , Gary Groves , liked Meade 's use of storytelling to open a discussion of mentoring and the need for elders to guide youth . " By watching men stand and interpret what they saw in the story , I saw how many ways there are to view something , " says Mr. Groves , a middle-aged ex-offender who has been in and out of jail since he was 14 years old . " You could see how people came from entirely different backgrounds , but somehow we 're all struggling with the same things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part because of a decline in public scrutiny , the number of men participating in groups nationwide has started to grow again , particularly in the past two years . Interviews with those active in men 's groups from coast to coast show that the number of smaller men 's groups is growing in large cities and small communities . <p> More and more , men are taking things into their own hands and not waiting to be directed by teachers on high , says Hoff , the publisher of M.E.N . magazine . <p> The form of meetings is as varied as the number of groups . Some groups were spawned by attendees at larger conferences , some just by word of mouth . Two trends in recent years are for groups to develop their own form out of the dynamics of their regular participants . More often than not they are leaderless , allowing each man to speak from the heart rather than just from the head . <p> " We ' take care of business ' from day to day by using our mental faculty that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says David Langer , member of a Los Angeles-based men 's group since 1989 . " But the deeper feelings are where we really live , whether we know it consciously or not . The challenge is to uncnder . Think about something sacred . Think about something that makes you cry , " says Don Shewey , a writer and editor in New York . " Now imagine talking about it to someone you barely know standing in Grand Central station at rush hour . " <p> Many participants say their participation in everything from conferences to small groups is teaching them skills that they have used to enrich their workplaces and neighborhoods . <p> Rudd Crawford , a math teacher in Oberlin , Ohio , uses principles he learned at a multicultural gathering to give his high school algebra class - which is 40 percent minority - training in interracial harmony one day a week . <p> " If there are antagonisms between kids in class , we have learned to settle them as a group , " he says . Crawford has built in more ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music . He takes time to deal with outside problems that disrupt the class . <p> " There is a real , shared ownership of this classroom that has settled them so they can finally focus on algebra , " he says . <p> Mr. Benjamin also found the ideas that he gleaned from men 's workshops to be helpful in his work as a community activist in his working-class town in North Carolina . <p> " Men in this town do n't have the time or money to visit a men 's retreat , " he says . " But they still need the tools to take charge of their emotional lives and confront cultural oppression , plant closings , right-to-work laws . " <p> And Harris Breiman , a teacher in Woodstock , N.Y. , has spent several years creating a national network for prison counseling called Oasis . <p> " Men like this have realized that personal growth is fine , but that it is worthless without a broader commitment to community service and social justice , " says Robert Moore , an author and leading figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the movement has had a beneficial effect on the men in their lives , despite concerns about the emphasis on men retreating from women to discuss important issues . <p> " Men 's work has completely changed our relationship , " says Laurie Burton of her boyfriend . " He found out he was n't alone in the way he felt and reacted to life . He has been able to fit together missing pieces of a puzzle that helped build a core of self-esteem he brings to everything he does . " <p> " My husband has opened up to the joy of life , " says Adonnah Langer of her 19-year marriage . " He has taken on much more depth and dimension as a human being and is able to share it with me . " <p> The new openness is equally welcome to many men . <p> " A majority of our letters over the past five years are from men who say , ' I never knew other men felt like this , ' or ' I thought I was the only guy who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The impact on society of such shifts may be subtle but it is significant , observers say . <p> In the workplace , more men are retiring early or stepping off the career treadmill with less concern for peer or societal censure . <p> More media coverage is given to men 's health issues , legal problems , and lives as fathers . <p> Men 's studies is growing as a scholarly field in universities , and government documentation of parental relationships has expanded to include father/child relationships . <p> The inequities for men as well as women in the workplace - a glass " cellar " in which many blue-collar men feel trapped , for example , compared with the glass " ceiling " for women - are regularly discussed . <p> Elsewhere , the culture at large has begun to reflect the primary aims of the men 's movement : more expressiveness , openness , and balance . <p> yIn movies : In " Bridges of Madison County , " " Unforgiven , " and " In the Line of Fire , " for instance , Clint Eastwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " portrays males that are vulnerable and expressive . Barbra Streisand , director of " Prince of Tides , " has publicly acknowledged the men 's movement in leading her to choose to examine the father-son relationship portrayed in that movie . <p> yBooks : More titles are published noting the costs of patriarchal culture , from " The Masculine Mystique : The Politics of Masculinity , " by Andrew Kimbrell , to " Fatherless America , " by David Blankenhorn . A new series by Doubleday on corporate leadership - titles include " The Aroused Heart , Poetry and the Preservation of Soul in Corporate America , " by David White , and " Money and the Meaning of Life , " by Jacob Needleman - encourages men to break free of traditional competitive management styles . <p> " The feminists of the ' 60s and ' 70s may have turned us into oversensitive New Age guys , " Hoff says . " Then the excesses of the early wildman stuff may have gone too far the other way . The secret is to find the grounded center in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Belly , " sums up the last decade of activism simply : " The real essence of the phenomenon for men has been the rediscovery of friendship . After all the drumming is over , men have found they have learned to talk to one another . "
