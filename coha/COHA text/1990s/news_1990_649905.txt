<p> Some days it seems that all the troubles in the world are coming through the phone lines into this unprepossessing suite of offices just outside the city limits . <p> " National Domestic Violence Hotline , " says one of the women answering the phones at 1-800-333-SAFE , her face mottled in the glow of the computer screen . " Are you safe ? " <p> " Do you and your children have a place to spend the night ? " <p> " Have you called the police ? " <p> " How often has he hit you ? " <p> The single largest cause of injury to women in the United States is abuse by the men they live with and , often , love . This comes as a surprise to many people , but not to the women who answer the hotline . They know that more than a quarter of the women treated at hospital emergency rooms have been abused , and that a third of the women murdered each year are killed by their husband or boyfriend . <p> Domestic Violence Awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV feature reports , proclamations and magazine stories . Right in there with the silver patterns , Bride 's magazine provides advice on how to spot an abuser before the wedding . Miss America has taken an interest in the subject . <p> It has become common to cast a bright light on our social problems : rape , incest , child abuse . This is a good thing , but it convinces us that things are better when they are not . Years ago women were afraid to say they were beaten because nobody talked about it ; today it 's talked about so frequently on TV shows and radio call-ins that they may be afraid to tell because they fear their friends would be incredulous . We assume rape victims go to the police . We assume children know adults are not to touch them that way . We assume it because the problem is out in the open . <p> The problem is out in the open , but the people are still behind closed doors . <p> Treatment is easier than prevention . If we really tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would tell us something about ourselves , male and female alike , that we do n't want to know , something humiliating and perhaps indelible . I told a woman in this field that I had heard many men were using their fists because they were threatened by the new liberated woman . " Yeah , " she said , " and before that they were doing it because their dinner was cold . " <p> So we make things better after , after the bruises and the broken bones . When Debi Cain , who runs a shelter in Pontiac , got started 13 years ago , there were no shelters for battered women in Michigan . Now there are 48 . <p> On Friday , Congress passed a resolution directing the states to consider domestic violence in custody proceedings . Many judges do n't . At a time when some corporate sponsors have become penurious and cautious  --  A.T . &T.'s; cowardly abandonment of Planned Parenthood because of its support of abortion rights comes to mind  --  Johnson &; Johnson raises $500,000 annually for the hotline , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 callers this year . <p> And many women do leave , finding a haven at a shelter , rebuilding a life . But it requires much more courage than a movie of the week would suggest . Many of them stay because they suspect they ca n't raise their children on one income in a two-income world . So they become adept at the use of foundation to conceal bruises . It is axiomatic that hardly anyone ever really runs into a door . <p> Debi Cain still marks the anniversary of the day when a nurse who came to the shelter after yet another fierce beating went home . Her husband called and told her that if she did n't , he would kill their kids . Then he put his gun on the hall table , and said , " When Mommy comes , go outside and play . " He shot her in the head , on their front lawn on a summer day . The children watched . <p> There is a new generation of boys and girls out there who will believe that a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match in which one contestant has no arms . Teaching them otherwise is the real answer , but the people who could take care of that are at the other end of the phones , knocking the receiver halfway across the room because if he told her once , he told her a million times not to tell , and anyway she drove him to it , and it 's only because he goes a little crazy when he gets jealous , or when he 's drunk , or when he 's had a hard day at work . And the telephone  --  he knows it 's her boyfriend , no matter what she says . It 's her fault he has to hit her . He 's sorry . It wo n't happen again . He knows he said that the last time . But this time he means it . Do n't cry . <p> And the children listen and watch and learn .
