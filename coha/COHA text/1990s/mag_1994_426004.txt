WELFARE REFORM , CLINTON AND THE FUTURE . <p> The fundamental STRATEGIC MISTAKE of the CLINTON PRESIDENCY is now clear . If President Clinton had pushed for WELFARE REFORM rather than HEALTH CARE REFORM in 1994 , we would now be talking about a great DEMOCRATIC REALIGNMENT , rather than a great REPUBLICAN REALIGNMENT . <p> Is there anything he can do about it now ? <p> Even the president 's chief of staff now admits that " in hindsight , it would have been better if we had taken on welfare reform " before tackling health care . In hindsight , of course , many things are clear . In hindsight , Mr. Bonaparte , was invading Russia such a good idea ? Any initiative might have been preferable to Clinton 's disastrous health crusade . <p> But welfare reform is not just any initiative . When NBC and The Wall Street Journal polled voters right after the election , reforming welfare was the issue most often listed as a top priority for the new Congress . Health reform came in a distant second . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perotian staples as a balanced budget amendment ( by a nearly two-to-one margin ) and term limits ( by a nine-to-one margin ) . Journal reporter Gerald Seib , in follow-up calls to Democrats and independents who voted Republican , was surprised to find that they spontaneously raised the welfare issue . <p> Nor did it really take hindsight to recognize welfare 's salience . How , after all , had Bill Clinton gotten elected in 1992 ? By promising to " end welfare as we know it . " That was the main message of the television ads his consultants ran in contested states . It was a central applause line in both of his State of the Union addresses . Indeed , as Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council points out , when it appeared that Clinton had stolen the welfare and crime issues from the Republicans in early 1994 , there was talk in the press that Clinton was on the verge of redefining American politics in his favor . " It 's not that they did n't see the tsunami coming on this particular issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just chose not to ride it . <p> How can welfare be so important ? After all , the program that most people mean when they talk about " welfare "  --  Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC )  --  only spends about $25 billion per year in federal and state money . Add in Food Stamps , and you 're still talking about 3 percent of the federal budget . But it 's a crucial 3 percent , both symbolically and substantively . <p> Poll-takers will tell you that welfare reform is a " values " issue . The values involved are work and family . Both AFDC and Food Stamps flout the work ethic , offering support to able-bodied Americans whether they work or not  --  the only major components of our " welfare state " that do this . Social Security 's retirement benefits , in contrast , only go to workers . Social Security is immensely popular , while AFDC is despised . AFDC also seemingly undermines families , because it is available , by and large , only to single parents ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , since welfare is implicated in America 's most difficult social problem  --  the existence of whole neighborhoods , mostly African American , where there are precious few intact , working families . Welfare may or may not have caused this underclass , but welfare is clearly what sustains it . And the underclass , in turn , drives the crime problem , the race problem , the " urban crisis " and the general sense of social decay ( " 12-year-olds having babies , 15-year-olds killing each other " ) . <p> The underclass is not the main cause of the other big domestic problem Clinton tried to address  --  the growing economic gap between skilled and unskilled workers . But welfare reform still speaks to that issue . Clinton 's political advisers seem to believe that the only way to win over the struggling middle class is to deliver tangible benefits  --  tax cuts , job training , health insurance . That 's one reason the White House focused on health care . But another way to appeal to struggling , underpaid workers is to honor their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dole . No wonder Newt Gingrich traveled around the country talking about dismantling the " liberal welfare state . " He was n't referring to Social Security . <p> The irony is that Clinton had a tough , even radical welfare plan to run on , if he 'd chosen to . Clinton pledged during the campaign to offer welfare recipients two years of education and training , after which they would " have to go to work , " in a community service job if necessary . As introduced , finally , last June , Clinton 's plan fudged the two-year limit a bit through various exemptions and deferrals . But in other respects it was surprisingly strict . The penalty for repeatedly failing to work , once the time limit was reached , was loss of all AFDC benefits . <p> Like every welfare reformer  --  Gingrich included  --  Clinton discovered that making recipients work actually costs more money than mailing out checks . Workers need supervisors and materials . Poor single mothers need subsidized day care . To save money , Clinton applied his time limit only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sense ( it would still discourage young girls who had n't become single mothers from going on the dole ) but it let the press unfairly portray Clinton 's plan as " modest . " Still , a Los Angeles Times poll found that Clinton 's two-years-and-go-to-work idea had 90 percent support . Even when voters were told the plan would cost them $50 billion over ten years , it drew 70 percent approval . <p> Imagine how the midterm election might have looked if Clinton had spent 1994 pushing this tough , popular proposal  --  standing up to the Congressional Black Caucus , fighting off paleoliberals and neoconservatives , overcoming gridlock , in general showing he is the sort of forceful leader voters have now concluded he 's not . Imagine ... oh , it 's too depressing . <p> Instead , Clinton has not only lost control of Congress ; he has lost control of welfare reform . Yes , he will reintroduce his two-years-and-work bill , but it will be dead in Gingrich 's House . Yes , as Clinton noted in a post-defeat news conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar " to his proposal . But the House Republicans have long since abandoned that bill as too liberal . Instead , the House is likely to take up the so-called Personal Responsibility Act , the far nastier scheme contained in the Contract with America . <p> How nasty ? Plenty . For starters it cuts off all AFDC and housing benefits of illegitimate children whose mothers are under 18 . States may , at their option , extend the ban to mothers aged 18 , 19 and 20 . The targeted children are banned from AFDC for life  --  if their mother works for ten years in a factory , gets laid off and applies for welfare at age 30 , she will still be turned away . <p> She 'll be turned away even if she 's willing to toil in a community service job . Other welfare recipients are required to work in such jobs  --  half the caseload must be in a work program by 2003 , and nobody can receive aid for more than two years without working for it . But after five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time , she is cut off completely  --  no AFDC , no workfare , for the rest of her life . That 's in the generous states . Less permissive jurisdictions can choose to cut off recipients after only two years ( if one year was spent in a work program ) . <p> The Personal Responsibility Act really does start to dismantle the welfare state . Another provision strips AFDC , housing and the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) program  --  which aids the elderly and disabled poor  --  of " entitlement " status . Instead , these programs are placed under a " cap " that requires them to be cut dramatically . When the " cap " is reached , disabled applicants for SSI could face waiting lists . Republicans can claim that they will protect SSI in this crunch . But then they will have to drastically cut something else . They need n't say what , of course  --  that 's the beauty of " caps . " <p> Did I mention that the plan ( including the $10 billion cost of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all benefits for legal immigrants . Oh , one more thing : the Food Stamps program is more or less abolished , folded in with other nutrition programs under its own lowered " cap . " <p> Taken as a whole , this is a pretty breathtaking package . Clinton must be appalled by it ( and by talk among GOP House members that it does n't go far enough ) . " At least in the president 's version , a job has to be available , " Representative Robert Matsui , a liberal Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee , told The Los Angeles Times . Of course , Matsui worked strenuously to block the president 's plan this year , when it had a chance . <p> What can Clinton do now ? The new dynamic of welfare reform is fairly clear : Clinton has veto power , but it is hollow , since everyone knows he wo n't want to reject a welfare reform bill before the 1996 election . In this situation , it probably does n't do him much good to draw sharp " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good at anyway . If he pledges to veto provision X , that only makes it more likely Republicans will stick it to him by passing X. <p> The Senate might save him . Republicans only have 53 votes , and seven belong to moderate Republicans who wrote a letter to Clinton last spring urging a soft line on welfare . Clinton can probably rely on Majority Leader Bob Dole to protect the Food Stamps program , which is popular in farm states . Beyond this , three potential tactics suggest themselves . <p> First , Clinton can emphasize work , and the principle that people who are willing to work to support their children should n't be left out in the cold . The business cycle has n't been repealed . If there are no jobs to be had in the private economy , do we really want a low-skilled divorcee who has been picking up trash in a subminimum-wage community service job to be left on her own ? Why not let her keep her workfare job ? The Republicans ' dirty little secret is that for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning workfare . After all , it costs money . It requires government . Better to cut ' em off . But that 's not a position Gingrich or Phil Gramm can defend easily . <p> Which brings up a second , more obvious Clinton strategy : helping the press portray the Republicans as mean . Gingrich , Dole and Gramm certainly look the part . And House Republicans are extremely vulnerable on the Contract 's explicit threat to SSI . The SSI program is very different from AFDC ; it gives cash only to people who can not work . Do we really want a 65-year-old single man who works for forty years and then goes blind to live in poverty ? There will be countless horror stories . Take it away , Peter Jennings . <p> Finally , Clinton must compromise , but he can do it in a way that preserves the chance to test out his own reforms . We do n't really know , after all , how many welfare recipients are simply incapable of working . We do n't know the extent to which cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it will simply produce homelessness . We do n't know if humane orphanages or group homes for single mothers are possible . The answers wo n't come from the study of the mincing , incremental reforms that have been tried . They will come from letting some states try the Republicans ' radical ideas and some states try Clinton 's radical ideas . That 's the obvious way out for the president . It also happens to be the right way to proceed . The results should come in sometime during Clinton 's second term . <p> By Mickey Kaus <p>
