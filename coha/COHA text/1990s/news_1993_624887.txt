<p> Having labored long in the vineyard of obscurity , Robert Olen Butler is savoring the taste of success . <p> He can tell you how high the paperback version of his Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of stories , " " A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain , " climbed on the Los Angeles Times best-seller list - No. 2 , after " " Jurassic Park " and ahead of " " The Pelican Brief . " Not bad for a $ 10 trade paperback . <p> He knows the hardcover numbers : 20,000 in print . Without the Pulitzer , that figure would have been less than 10,000 . <p> He receives more requests to give readings - he gave one last week to an appreciative audience of about 35 at the River Oaks Bookstore here . This is a particular joy to a man who entered college wanting to be an actor . <p> " " The ham has been sizzling in me since April 13 , " he jokes . <p> The book for which he won the 1993 Pulitzer for fiction last spring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each is narrated by a Vietnamese expatriate living in southern Louisiana . <p> The narrators range from a Saigon bar girl plying her trade in New Orleans to a middle-aged woman with a knack for winning game shows to a wimpy ex-spy whose wife is cheating on him . <p> What first impresses is Butler 's success at crawling into the skins of people not only various in age and experience but from an entirely different culture . <p> But he does more : In these narrative voices he paints the collision and melding of Vietnamese and American experiences . <p> These are characters who are becoming American without ceasing to be Vietnamese . In that subtle interplay they emerge both real and fresh . <p> Butler lives in Lake Charles , La. , where he teaches creative writing at McNeese State . He 's 48 but could pass for 40 , articulate , outgoing and confident . <p> Although he has lived in Louisiana since 1985 , there 's nothing regionalist about him . His accent remains that of the Midwest , where he was raised . Dressed in fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greenwich Village than down on the bayou . He makes it clear that his goal is to be considered a major literary novelist . <p> " " Good Scent " is his seventh published book and the fourth to deal , one way or another , with the year he spent in Vietnam as an Army counterintelligence officer . That was 1971 . He calls it " " the most intense and richly brimming year of my life . " <p> " " I was incredibly close to the people there , " he said in an interview before his reading . <p> " " I knew the language - the Army sent me to language school . I spent five months in the countryside , a few weeks down by the South China Sea and seven months in Saigon , where I worked a civilian-clothes job . <p> " " I delighted in just wandering the streets and back alleys into the night and being with people . I fell in love several times . I had lots of very close friendships and very lovely acquaintanceships with dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street - who , by the way , was the most cheerful man I ever met - to the highest government officials . <p> " " It was a ravishingly sensual place . " <p> Being able to speak the language enabled Butler to understand and appreciate the Vietnamese in a way most other Americans could n't . <p> " " The American popular image of the Vietnamese was as a cunning , crafty , cold-hearted , manipulative , dangerous , wily people , " he said . " " That 's the very antithesis of the Vietnamese . The Vietnamese as a group are the most wonderfully friendly , open and generous people I 've ever met . " <p> After returning to the United States , Butler worked from 1975 to 1985 as the editor of a New York-based weekly business magazine . Before the war he had earned a master 's degree from the University of Iowa in playwriting . But after the year in Vietnam , he turned to fiction . <p> On the commuter train from Long Island into Manhattan , he wrote novels , composing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote six before he got one of them - the fourth - published . That was The Alleys of Eden ( 1981 ) . <p> Five more published novels followed : Sun Dogs ( 1982 ) , Countrymen of Bones ( 1983 ) , On Distant Ground ( 1985 ) , Wabash ( 1987 ) and The Deuce ( 1989 ) . <p> The reviews were good . The sales were n't . <p> Butler was known in literary circles , but not among the general reading public . Nevertheless , in 1989 he was asked to submit a piece to a National Public Radio series called " " The Sound of Writing . " He had just finished The Duel , which dealt with an Amerasian boy and was told in first person . Left over from that novel was a bit of Vietnamese folkway about training crickets to fight . <p> " " I sat down on a Sunday afternoon , so I set the story on a Sunday afternoon , and I started writing in the voice of a Vietnamese man living in Lake Charles and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler said . " " He wanted to get him interested in cricket fighting on a boring Sunday afternoon . <p> " " Six hours later , I got up from my computer with the story " " Crickets , " which is in the book . Within 24 hours I had ideas for two dozen more stories , each from a Vietnamese voice . " Seven of the narrators are women . All different ages are represented . " " The variety was there from the start , " Butler said . <p> He did no research for the book . The characters are n't based on real people , although Butler has them living in real Vietnamese communities in southern Louisiana , communities with which he 's familiar . <p> The setting does n't particularly figure into the stories . <p> Butler agrees they could have been set in southern California . <p> " " Graham Greene said in his memoir that all great novelists have bad memories , " Butler said . <p> " " What you remember comes out as journalism . What you forget goes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nobody in this book who 's a real person , directly . <p> " " Those people are characters from the compost heap , made up of all the people I knew in Vietnam . " <p> While the characters in the book are all Vietnamese-Americans , Good Scent is not simply a " " Vietnam novel , " Butler said . <p> His goal is to illuminate American culture , and beyond that , the human condition itself . <p> " " American culture , in all its variety and absurdity and profundity , is present in every story and encountered in a fresh way because we are placed in the sensibility of the Vietnamese , " he said . <p> " " Whether it 's voodoo or game shows or pornography or American business - the Vietnamese encounter all these things and see them in a fresh way . We get so used to looking at them that we do n't see them ourselves . <p> " " Also , they approach them from their own culture and adapt their culture to fit . And in watching this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours in a way we often ca n't . " <p> Response to the book from Vietnamese readers has been quite positive , Butler said . He is fond of quoting the letter he received from a former Vietnamese foreign service officer who said he secured the rights to translate the novel because " " someone is speaking for me in an enchanted voice . " <p> But Butler did lose one close Vietnamese friend in Louisiana who was deeply angered by the decision to include a picture of North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh in the collage on the hardback dust jacket . For this man , Ho was simply the devil incarnate . <p> Having won the Pulitzer , Butler is finding new interest in his earlier , and now out-of-print , books . His publisher , Henry Holt , will reissue all six in both hardcover and trade paperback , he said . <p> His new novel , titled They Whisper and scheduled for release in late January , differs markedly from Good Scent in subject matter . <p> " " It 's a serious literary novel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Butler said . " " Nobody writes about it , really . There 's sex in literary works of fiction , but very few books go directly at what it is . " <p> The novel is written in the first-person voice of a 35-year-old man who thinks back on all the women he has loved . <p> After that , perhaps another book dealing with Vietnam . Butler plans to return to that country this winter . It will be his first visit back . <p> " " Everybody was profoundly shaped by that experience , " he said , making the point that combat was n't necessarily what made the biggest impact on the Americans who served there . <p> " " We were drawn out of a place and thrown forcibly into a confrontation with alienness . Everyone who went there had to come to grips with the question of what is our own and what is other . That 's really where I think the more interesting and deeper issue was played out .
