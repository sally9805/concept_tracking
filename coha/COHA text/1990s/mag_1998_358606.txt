Singers recording albums of standards face a dilemma not unlike actors contemplating Hamlet : how to launch songs with opening lines nearly as familiar  --  and potentially as rote  --  as " To be or not to be " and still sound fresh and spontaneous and not at all like a stale peanut-scented night at the airport Sheraton 's cocktail lounge . In this regard , Jeffery Smith , an American expatriate living in Paris , has set himself a real challenge on his first American CD . He has sequenced the songs Lush Life ( " I used to visit all the very gay places " ) , Misty ( " Look at me/ I 'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree " ) and Love for Sale ( " Love for sale/ Advertising young love for sale " ) back to back to back  --  all that 's missing is " Is n't it rich ? / Are we a pair ? " But thanks to his own smart arrangements , a supple baritone and a natural way with a lyric , Smith runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intro finally touches down on the verse like a glider wafting back to earth  --  he 's landed before we even know it , and that 's only the start of the ride . <P> Full of such grace notes , A Little Sweeter ( Verve ) is nevertheless a curious album , and not just because it opens with an ambitious but maudlin version of Eleanor Rigby ( is there such a thing as a non-maudlin Eleanor Rigby ? Could one even be possible given the known laws of art ? ) . Recorded with the pianist Kenny Barron and his regular rhythm section ( Ray Drummond on bass and Ben Riley on drums ) , this is such a simple , straight-ahead shot of vocal jazz that it could have been made 40 years ago , and yet it could n't sound newer . This may be the most vital album you 'll hear this year , coursing with a palpable sense of musicians actually listening to one another  --  a cornerstone of great jazz , of course , but one that must be surprisingly hard to capture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , his is a strong though uneccentric personality . As a baritone , Smith has drawn obvious comparisons to Billy Eckstine and Johnny Hartman . But whereas those singers can sometimes sound mesmerized by the sheer resonance of their own vocal cords , Smith has a more nimble sense of phrasing  --  he 's rich yet light , the flourless chocolate cake of a Weight Watcher 's dream . On the Art Blakey tune Moanin ' he lets loose with a paradoxically graceful abandon that would make a silky shouter like Joe Williams proud . <P> A native New Yorker , Smith , 43 , has lived in Paris since 1991 . He had kicked around the American entertainment industry as both a singer and an actor , playing nightclubs and doing bit parts in ' 80s brat-pack movies , but like too many jazz musicians before him , he has found a more receptive audience in Europe , where he has starred in musicals and performed regularly with French pianist Claude Bolling 's big band . Smith describes being hounded for autographs by fans as young as 12 who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home do n't even know who Billie Holiday is . " Still , he hopes to move back to the States , describing the European scene as ultimately limiting . " Jazz belongs to Americans , " he says . " You want a real croissant , you go to Paris , but you want a real pizza , you go to New York , you go to Chicago . " Sticklers and Neapolitans might take issue with his analogy , but grant Smith  --  a real deal himself  --  a pass . <P>  --  By Bruce Handy
