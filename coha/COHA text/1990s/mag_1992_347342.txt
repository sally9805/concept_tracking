NEW YORKER JOSEPH SCOTT QUIT SMOKING AND PUT the money he would have spent on cigarettes into a cookie jar . Seeing the money mount , he says , helped reinforce his resolve . Now , two years later , Scott has amassed $3,285 , and he 's taking a luxury cruise . <P> Forget health ; let 's talk money . <P> Consider a teenage girl , eager to be attractive and confronted constantly with images of healthy , Virginia-slim tobacco models . Like about 1 in 5 teenage girls today , she gets hooked . Taking into account FICA and income taxes , she could see $1,500 in pretax earnings each year go up in smoke  --  $1,500 that could otherwise be put toward her kids ' education , a first home , equity in a small business , or an IRA . <P> Nor are cigarettes the only cost . <P>  --  Smokers spend more on cold remedies and health care . ( A division of Dow Chemical found that smokers averaged 5.5 more days of absence each year and took eight more days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life insurance . ( The Tobacco Institute may not be convinced that smoking kills , but the three life insurers owned by tobacco companies certainly are . CNA is owned by Lorillard parent Loews , the Franklin Life and American Tobacco are owned by American Brands , and Farmers Group and British-American Tobacco are owned by B.A.T Industries . All three charge smokers nearly double for term insurance . Why ? Because at any age , a smoker is about twice as likely to die as a nonsmoker . ) <P> In short , tobacco addiction is a major economic handicap . A child who can avoid it has a far better shot at lifelong financial health than one who gets hooked . <P> The tobacco industry professes not to want children to smoke . It points to a free pamphlet it distributes called Tobacco : Helping Youth Say No . But the pamphlet never once mentions the word cancer , never once mentions addiction . ( Nicotine is as addictive as heroin , says the Surgeon General . ) Instead , the reason given is that kids are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for adults . Of course , it 's hard to imagine a message that would make smoking more attractive . <P> A better approach , I like to think , is contained in a $6 paperback called Kids Say Do n't Smoke . ( I like to think it 's better , because I helped write it . ) For a free copy , send four 29 cents stamps to SmokeFree Educational Services , Box 3316 , New York , N.Y . 10008 . <P> The tobacco industry says its advertising is designed merely to persuade existing smokers to switch brands , not to encourage nonsmokers to start . If so , why not simply ban all tobacco advertising and promotion ? Surely Congress would agree to do so if the industry asked it to . And look what would happen : brand switching would largely stop , leaving market shares essentially " frozen . " And the $4 billion the industry currently spends on U.S. advertising would fall straight to the bottom line ! Pure profit ! You 'd think the tobacco industry would be begging for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep that lovable Camel cartoon character in front of children , and to fly Newport banners up and down the beach , because if we do n't hook the kids , how are we to replace all the customers who quit or die each year ? Most smokers start between the ages of 8 and 18  --  thousands of them a day in the U.S. ( and , thanks in part to aggressive efforts by the Bush Administration , many more abroad ) .
