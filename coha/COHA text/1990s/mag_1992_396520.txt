Facing a reluctant Israel , Hanan Ashrawi speaks for the Palestinians From Madrid to Washington to Moscow and again last week in the American capital , the scene has been repeated over and over during the last three months . Wherever the tense Middle East peace talks have convened , grim-faced Palestinian negotiators  --  men steeped in the region 's Byzantine politics  --  step aside whenever they are confronted by the press and clear the way for a striking , self-confident woman . The woman walks up to the microphones and takes center stage with ease . Her mellifluous voice resonates seductively , turning tired propaganda into eloquent appeals for sympathy . The strong classical features of her face evoke memories of Maria Callas . But Hanan Ashrawi , 45 , is a political diva , and her stage is the news . She is perhaps the most sophisticated weapon the Palestinians have ever fielded against Israel . With her impeccable English and no-nonsense manner , the woman from Ramallah , in the Israeli-occupied West Bank , has lowered the volume on an emotional issue , replacing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a task she has performed with increasing frequency since 1988 , when she made the first of many appearances on ABC 's Nightline . Now she is the highly effective chief spokesperson for the Palestinian delegation to the historic peace talks  --  and , as a spark plug for the 33-man group , a tremendous influence behind the scenes . " Unlike most Arabs , " says one White House official , " she can deal with Americans in terms they can understand . " Filtered through personal experience of the cruelties of the occupation  --  and the ongoing turmoil of the Palestinian intifadah , or uprising , in the West Bank  --  Ashrawi 's exhortations reverberate with particular poignancy . " Stop manufacturing tear gas , " she says . " Stop sending military aid to Israel . Stop sending every Israeli soldier $1,000 a year . Your tax money should go to preserve life , not to destroy life . " Through her words , Palestinians are emerging as victims rather than purveyors of violence . When Israelis see the U.S.-educated professor of medieval literature on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plight of her people , many simply throw up their hands , dismayed by her potential impact on American public opinion . " Where is Yasser Arafat when we need him most ? " asks one Israeli after seeing Ashrawi in action . Last November , George Bush sounded a clear note of warning when she was threatened with jail for maintaining contact with the Palestinian Liberation Organization , which is outlawed in Israel . Speaking to a group of Arab-Americans , the President said , " Hanan is on my mind . " Tactfully , the Israelis chose not to arrest her . Ashrawi herself was never intimidated . " I never take orders from the Israelis , " she says . " They may not like what I have to say , but you have to tell someone when enough is enough . " As a Christian Arab  --  her family is Anglican  --  and as a woman , Ashrawi is an unlikely representative for a predominantly Muslim cause with male chauvinist leaders . While conservative Palestinians carp at her religion and her sex , Ashrawi is immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And her high profile there  --  and in the American media  --  has made her indispensable to the cause . Ashrawi was born to play a leading role . Her father , Daoud Mikhail , was a doctor and landowner in Ramallah who helped found the PLO . Hanan , the youngest of his five daughters , was precocious and brave . She was able to read and write at age 3 and , though inclined to compromise , never ruled out action as a remedy for harassment . Her sister Huda , an artist living in Washington , D.C. , recalls a big boy in first grade teasing Hanan  --  and being bonked on the head for his trouble . Says Huda : " He never bothered her again . " Graduating from a Quaker high school in Ramallah , Hanan attended the American University in Beirut , Lebanon , where she became an honors student and an expert in Chaucer . There she developed a passion for Scrabble and antique jewelry  --  and after hearing from friends and family , began to write melancholy poems about Palestinian life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day . After the Six-Day War in 1967 , Hanan , hindered by Israeli law , could not return to the newly occupied West Bank . Thus , in 1970 , she decided to attend the University of Virginia as a graduate student . Says her adviser , professor of medieval history Hoyt N. Duggan : " At first I was worried she would n't do well because of all her outside interests ( among them , Palestinian politics and feminism )  --  but then I discovered she was tutoring the bottom third of the class in her spare time . " With the passage of the Israeli law of family reunion in 1973 , Ashrawi returned home . An avowed feminist , she was determined not to marry and immersed herself in politics . But around Christmas that year she met an acquaintance of her actress sister Nadia . His name was Emile Ashrawi , and he was a photographer and an amateur rock musician . She recalls , " I was touched by his looks . He had long hair and was obviously living his art . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We went dancing and have stayed together ever since . " Husband and wife , though , have different mind-sets . While disliking violence , she will not rule out action if all else fails . " I am a pacifist , " says Emile , who abhors politics , " but she is not far from it . The difference is that she is a realist , and I am a dreamer , floating in the air . " She has conceded one point though . " If you want a future for Palestine , " says Hanan , " you have to accept the existence of Israel . " Today , as his wife flies from capital to capital , Emile stays home raising their two daughters , Amal , 15 , and Zeina , 10 . " He 's a magnificent father , " says Hanan . " Strong , kind and good . He 's not only supportive , he is my confidant and source of strength . " Says Emile : " I want her to do whatever she wants to do . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have our common life . I have no right to tell her what to do . " And she keeps on doing  --  rushing from city to city , airport to hotel , debate to conference , incessantly puffing on a cigarette . ( She goes through two packs a day of Salem Lights . ) She sighs : " Somebody has to invent a longer day . " The work has a personal price . " It affects the children , " says Emile . " She knows it , I know it , the children know it . But we have to accept it . " Hanan agrees . " Our parents were the dispossessed , " she explains . " We are the disinherited . What I want for our children is independence and freedom . " <p>
