What U.S. cultural magnet is located in Cooperstown , N.Y. ? Easy : GLIMMERGLASS OPERA . Well , yes , the Baseball Hall of Fame is there too , but in contrast to the Hall of Fame , Glimmerglass 's hits ( and its basses ) are onstage . Set along the sylvan shore of Otsego Lake , the festival is noted for its ambitious repertory and stable of budding American singers . This summer 's season features a Jonathan Miller production of Beethoven 's Fidelio , in which Miller does not change the 18th century prison locale to one of those voguish operatic places he calls " nowhere and nowhen , " but instead treats the work with standard , even standoffish respect . The surprise is Il Re Pastore , an 18th century trifle about a shepherd king who is prepared to give up the throne for his sweetheart . Director Mark Lamos uses a scene-shifting crew of children in T shirts and sneakers , who playfully push four large letters together , forming AMOR . Later , two more letters appear to create the enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed . The composer , who often used the backward spelling in correspondence , would have enjoyed the joke .
