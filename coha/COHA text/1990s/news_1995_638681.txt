<p> It was going to bring hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs , a boom in trade , a drop in illegal immigration , and new economic and political stability for Mexico . <p> Supporters touted it as the wave of the future , part of a seemingly unstoppable series of free-trade pacts spreading across the Americas and the rest of the world . <p> Opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement called it a bum deal , saying it would flood the United States with Mexican imports and suck hundreds of thousands of American jobs south of the border . <p> Now , 22 months after NAFTA went into effect , the results are increasingly apparent : Both sides were wrong . <p> Jobs . Despite the grim trade results after the crash of the Mexican economy , predictions of a job exodus have failed to materialize . In the first half of 1994 , the United States enjoyed a $ 1.6 billion surplus ; this year , Mexico holds the upper hand with an $ 8.9 billion surplus , but overall U.S. employment losses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illegal immigration has increased this year by as much as 10 percent - the result of Mexico 's crisis and a strong U.S. economy . <p> Investment . Mexico 's stability is more dependent than ever on the whims of Wall Street and Washington . Earlier this year , Mexico was rescued from financial disaster by $ 20 billion in U.S. aid . But with investors still jittery , Mexico 's economy in a severe recession and talk in Congress about withdrawing from NAFTA , analysts warn that more trouble may come . <p> Despite the discouraging news , Clinton administration officials insist that all is well with free trade . <p> " It 's time to stop playing the ' blame NAFTA ' game every time there is a ' shock ' felt in the international financial markets , " said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown . " NAFTA clearly has had a positive impact on U.S. jobs and exports . " <p> When pressed for evidence of a NAFTA-led job increase , Commerce officials say they have made no comprehensive study of the issue . Instead , they offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Success Stories . " <p> However , officials of all four companies said they have created no extra U.S. jobs because of NAFTA . One firm , San Rafael , Calif. - based Panamax Inc. , which makes electrical surge protectors , said its sales to Mexico are down 50 percent this year . <p> As for the " blame game , " many economists agree with Brown that it is unfair to view NAFTA only through the prism of Mexico 's 10-month-old crisis , as critics do . But the two are not unrelated , they say . <p> " To say that the fall of the peso was caused by NAFTA simply is n't correct , " said David Ranney , an economist at the University of Illinois . " But it was caused by the kinds of economic policies that NAFTA institutionalized and expanded on - the whole notion of export-led strategies , the elimination of the notion of managed trade , the enhancement of capital mobility . <p> " It increased the wave of speculative investment in Mexico , making its economy increasingly unstable . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meltdown only by the U.S. taxpayer . <p> A $ 20 billion U.S. rescue package has stabilized Mexico 's financial markets and coaxed some Wall Street investors back . After more than $ 30 billion in private foreign capital fled Mexico after the December crash , an estimated $ 18 billion has returned in recent months . Experts say the economy can recover only if the influx continues . <p> " Mexico has n't bottomed out yet , " said Brian Barish , a Mexico analyst with Lazard Freres , a New York investment bank . " There 's an extreme lack of liquidity . Because all that capital left , nobody 's paying anybody for anything . ... The longer it goes on , the harder it will be to manage it . " <p> Not surprisingly , NAFTA 's opponents say they have been vindicated by the results so far . <p> " NAFTA has destroyed our trade balance with Mexico , and it has cost hundreds of thousands of jobs , " said Rep. Marcy Kaptur , an Ohio Democrat . In the coming weeks , Kaptur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspend NAFTA . <p> Their NAFTA Benchmarks Bill would set quantifiable limits on the trade deficit , job losses and currency rates that would trigger an automatic suspension of the pact . The bill already has revived the 1993 anti-NAFTA lobby : a populist coalition of pro-labor liberals and isolationist conservatives . Foes of the trade pact have taken aim at the essential pro-NAFTA formula : Free trade increases exports jobs . <p> During the 1993 debate over NAFTA , the pact 's boosters frequently cited a study by the Institute for International Economics , a Washington think tank that champions free trade . The study concluded that 19,600 jobs are created in the U.S. economy for every billion dollars in net exports . <p> The study forecast that by 1995 , the pact would cause a net gain of 171,000 jobs in the United States . The Bush and Clinton administrations adopted the study 's multiplier concept in arguing that a NAFTA-led export boom would create 200,000 net jobs by 1998 . Now , the study 's authors admit that they have egg on their faces . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately zero , " said co-author Gary Hufbauer . <p> NAFTA opponents are less generous and use the multiplier as a boomerang . Calculating the slippage from the United States ' 1993 $ 1.6 billion trade surplus with Mexico to this year 's $ 8.9 billion deficit , which is expected to reach $ 15 billion by the end of the year , the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen arrives at a theoretical figure of more than 300,000 net jobs lost . <p> Most experts agree that a U.S. deficit may continue for years . President Ernesto Zedillo and other officials have made clear that they plan to keep the peso somewhat undervalued , thus stimulating exports and shrinking Mexican consumers ' ability to pay for imported American products . <p> But NAFTA 's foes grasp at straws when they try to identify the hundreds of thousands of lost jobs . <p> According to Labor Department statistics , the overall employment loss from the trade pact appears to be light . In NAFTA 's 20 months through August , 68,482 workers nationwide had applied for a special NAFTA program of federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted under the plan , which requires proof only that the job loss be trade-related , not caused specifically by NAFTA . <p> No figures are available for jobs created by NAFTA , but with 3.5 million net jobs created in 1994 in the overall U.S. economy , the trade pact 's losses pale by comparison . <p> For many Mexicans , NAFTA has caused little interruption in a long national tradition : emigrating to the United States . The results belie NAFTA backers ' earlier promises that the pact would decrease the migration flow because of widening prosperity inside Mexico . <p> Arrests by the Border Patrol from California to Texas are up 41 percent from before NAFTA , although immigration authorities say much of that increase is caused by bolstered enforcement , such as Operation Gatekeeper , which has concentrated agents and equipment on the international line near San Diego . <p> PRINCIPLES <p> The guiding principles that the United States , Canada and Mexico are committed to promote under the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation , the labor-side agreement to NAFTA . The principles do n't establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Freedom of association and protection of the right to organize . <p> 2 . The right to bargain collectively . <p> 3 .
