I have yet to witness a March that comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb  --  especially in Blight , Idaho . God created March in case eternity should prove too brief . " I penned that line many years ago , back in the days when I still harbored literary pretensions , and I am pleased to see that it has stood the test of time . In all modesty , I think it 's rather Shakespearean . It also remains an accurate description of March , the longest month by far , something more than a thousand days by my reckoning . March may be somewhat shorter in Southern states , but here in the North , it stretches on forever  --  wet and cold and full of wind and slush . Hunting is long past , fishing yet to come , and camping but a dream . I stand at the window and stare vacantly out into the blustery gloom , a Chinook devouring banks of gray , grubby snow ; water streaming down the road and pooling in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air filled with an incessant whine . " Will you stop that incessant whining ! " my wife , Bun , yells at me . " All you do day after day is stand at that window and stare vacantly into space . Why do n't you get a hobby of some kind ? " " Staring vacantly into space is my hobby , " I respond sharply . " My March hobby . I loathe March . " " Poor baby . " One thing I hate even worse than March is mock sympathy from a smart-alecky spouse . Bun is a master of the form . It being evident that I could expect no sympathy from my wife of many Marches , I continue to stare vacantly out the window , trying to console myself with the fact that this is by no means the longest March I have ever experienced . The longest March occurred back when I was about 15 , or at least somewhere around the middle of those horrible teenage years when the world is your oyster , but you ca n't pry it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Blight , Idaho , and stayed late . In other parts of the world , it was probably April or May or even June , but in Blight , it was still ugly old March . We woke up with mud , went to bed with mud and dreamed fitfully of mud . The thaw had come . We had spent the entire winter shoveling snow , but it did no good to shovel mud  --  it was endless . If your car got stuck in a mud hole , and you started shoveling it out , soon your car would be stuck in a well . It was not unusual to be driving in that distant and gentler time and to actually stop when a stranger on the road flagged you down . " I got my car stuck in the mud , " he 'd say , " Could you tow it out for me ? " Sure , " you 'd reply . " Where 's your car ? " " I 'm standing on it . " Right then you would know that here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud . When your car got stuck in the mud , any car trying to tow you out would also probably get stuck in the mud . So what you did was to go find a man with a horse , a big strong horse , one that could tow your car out of the mire . It was that very chore , finding a tow horse , that was thrust upon me so many miserable Marches ago . All week I had been incarcerated in Delmore Blight High School , where , among other unmentionable atrocities , I was daily exposed to the corpse of Latin , a language that had been dead so long it was almost unrecognizable . ( If Latin had n't already been dead , I personally would have been only too happy to kill it . ) Then the weekend arrived , but a weekend filled with nothing but ugly March . Mud . Rain . Sleet . Wind . The whole world seemingly had filled up with icy swirling mud-brown water . All Saturday morning I stared vacantly out the window . March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there staring vacantly out into space , " my mother scolded . " For heaven 's sake , find yourself a hobby ! " " Staring vacantly into space is my hobby . " It 's always good to get an early start on your hobbies . As I stood there staring vacantly into space , my eyes suddenly focused on a Sheriff 's car plowing in through the mud of our farm road . Hastily reviewing my activities of the previous week , I relaxed , confident that the visit from the law had nothing to do with me . " Hey , Ma , " I yelled . " Guess who 's coming in . Deputy Wiley Dipp . " " That miserable little twerp ! I wonder what he wants . If you shot off another sewer-pipe cannon down at the golf course , you 're in for it . " " Look , Ma , eyebrows . I 'm done fooling with blackpowder . I like eyebrows . I like skin . " " That 's nice . Now go answer the door . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water streaming off the brim of his cowboy hat as he glowered at me . The deputy was one of my least favorite people . " Which of the womenfolk did you come for , Wiley ? " I asked , opening the door . " Do n't smart-mouth me , kid . Where 's your mom ? " " Here she comes now . What 's up ? " " Rancid Crabtree is what 's up . I 'm going to arrest him . " " Arrest Rancid ? " Mom and I gasped in unison . Rancid Crabtree was a kindly old woodsman who lived in a little shack back against the mountain , a gentle soul who never bothered anybody . He was also my much beloved mentor , teaching me all about woodsmanship and lots of other stuff , some of which I was pretty sure my mother did n't want me to know . Rancid was a serious student of hygiene . Long ago he had figured out that it was unwise ever to take baths , because they eat holes in your protective crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't agree with Rancid 's theory , however , and I was forced to take at least one bath a week and thus catch colds . Mom 's own theory about why Rancid never caught colds was that the germs could n't stomach the smell , and left him alone . " Yep , " Wiley said . " Crabtree deliberately broke a pool cue down at Bart 's Saloon Saturday night . " " That does n't sound like a crime to me , " Mom said . " He broke it over Bart 's head , " Wiley said . " That does n't sound like a crime to me , " Mom said . " Then he threw Bart out the door of his own saloon . " " That does n't sound like a crime to me , " Mom said . " The door was closed when Crabtree done it . " " Oh . " " Problem is , " Wiley said , " I ca n't find Crabtree 's shack so I can arrest him . I need the loan of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely restrain a laugh . Dumb ol ' Wiley actually thought I 'd show him how to find Rancid 's shack , actually help him arrest my best friend in the whole world . Well , fat chance of that ! Sleet splattered so hard against the window of the deputy 's car that we could barely see to make the turn from the highway onto the mud road that led back to Rancid 's shack . " Take another left up there , " I told Wiley . Odd that a deputy would still remember that unfortunate business with the sewer-pipe cannon . Apparently there was no statute of limitations on the crime of firing a croquet ball from a sewer pipe down a golf-course fairway . Wiley turned left . " You sure this is a road ? " he whined . " It sure do n't look like one . " " It 's a road , Wiley , " I said , hunched sullenly down into my mackinaw . " Pretty much of one anyway . Why do you ask ? " " ' Cause we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ! " I yawned . " That 's no lake . " " It ai n't no lake ? Well then , it 's the biggest puddle I ever seen . But I guess we can plow through it . " Wiley tromped down on the gas pedal . I 'd never been to the ocean . So I had no idea how big waves got there , but I suspected the wave created by the impact of Wiley 's car would have run a good second to the best the ocean had to offer . Steam billowed from under the hood , the lights went out , and the radio went dead . " Holy bleep ! " cried the deputy . " You 're in for it now , boy ! You told me this was n't a lake ! " " It is n't a lake . It 's a crick . See , the ice has jammed up down below and backed up the crick . " " Well , shoot , if it 's a crick , there should be a bridge over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge is just under a foot or so of water . Even though you could n't see it , you landed the car smack on the bridge . I got ta hand it to you , Wiley , you 're a pretty darn good driver . " Wiley ignored the compliment , and set about banging his forehead up and down on the steering wheel , as though that would get us out of the crick . It did no good at all , of course , except to improve my mood considerably . After a bit , Wiley said , " We got to find somebody with a horse to tow us out . You know anybody around here with a horse ? " " Only one person , " I said . " Who 's that ? " " Rancid Crabtree . " Wiley carried on like a madman for a few moments , and then finally ordered me out of the car and into the crick to go and fetch Rancid and his horse . Having slogged half a mile through mud up to my knees , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack . He invited me in , blew the dust out of his guest cup , and poured me a steaming jolt of black coffee . We chatted a while about the miseries of March , and how bored we were with everything , and how we could n't wait for trout season to open . He mentioned that he must have sprained his back , because it had been giving him a little trouble the past couple of days . " Probably jist all the wet and cold weather , " he speculated . " Or maybe Ah lifted somethin " heavy and throwed it too hard . Anyway , what brang you out on a day like this ? " " Oh , I almost forgot . Wiley Dipp is coming to arrest you . " " He is ? Hot dang ! Thet 's the best news Ah heard all March . Let 's see , Ah 'll take maw checkers and checker board , because Ah thank Murph is still in jail . Maw Tucker 's cookin ' at the jail , ai n't she ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah could be thar in time fer supper . By the way , what 's Wiley arrestin ' me for ? " " Throwing Bart through the door without opening it first . " " Ah did n't know you could go to jail fer throwin ' Bart through a door . If Ah 'd know 'd thet , Ah 'd a done it the fust of March , " stead of waitin " until dang near the middle . " " Glad you 're so happy about paying your debt to society , " I said . " But the problem is , Wiley 's car is stuck in the crick and we have to harness old Brimstone to pull it out . Otherwise , you 'll never make it to jail in time for supper . " " Wait jist a dang minute ! Ah might as soon not go to jail as have to harness Brimstone ! But what the heck , let 's give it a try ! " We went out to the little corral behind Rancid 's shack , and Rancid , Brimstone and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand on my head , but Rancid grabbed the horse around the neck and bit down on its ear , and then Brimstone tried to crush Rancid against a corral post . The old woodsman managed to escape , and Brimstone chased him around the corral a couple of times and finally cornered him , and then Rancid doubled up his fist and punched the horse squarely between the eyes , buckling its knees and stunning it long enough for us to get the bridle and harness in place . " Shucks , thet was easier than Ah expected , " Rancid said . " Now let 's go pull the deputy 's car out , so he kin arrest me and git me to jail in time fer supper . " Presently , Rancid , Brimstone and I arrived back at the deputy 's car . Wiley peered out at us through the rain-streaked windshield . " C'm on out of thar and arrest me , Wiley , " Rancid ordered . " I got to git to jail in time fer supper . " Wiley got out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when I 'm dang good and ready , Crabtree , " he growled . " First thing , you got to tow my car back out of this lake . " " Fine with me , " Rancid said . He drove Brimstone around to the back of the car . The horse seemed to be returning to its own ornery self , tentatively reaching around to take a bite out of Rancid 's shoulder . The old woodsman pointed a cautionary finger at the horse , who then pretended merely to be admiring Rancid 's mackinaw . Wiley rubbed his jaw thoughtfully as he searched for a way to hook the tow chain to the vehicle . " I guess the only thing to do is for you to crawl under the car and hook the chain to the frame , Crabtree . " " Wahl , Ah do n't thank thet 's the only thang to do , Wiley . T' other thang to do is fer you to crawl under the car and hook the chain . Ah cai n't hold maw breath thet long under water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple days ago , and cai n't do no strenuous exercise . " Wiley looked at me . " Do n't look at me , Wiley . " " I 'm certainly not submerging myself under a foot of water to hook that chain , " Wiley said . He looked at Brimstone . " I 've got a better idea . I 'll just commandeer your horse and ride back to a house that has a telephone and get some real help . " " But then you 'll arrest me , right , Wiley , so Ah kin git to jail in time fer supper ? " " No , I ai n't . I 've decided a jail 's too good for you , Crabtree . You enjoy it too much . Go on back to your crummy shack . " " Gol-dang it , Wiley , here Ah come all the way out here in the rain and mud and now you wo n't arrest me . If thet do n't rile me up somethin ' fierce . And now yer stealin ' maw horse . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiley , " cause if you do n't ... " Wiley laughed , tilting back his cowboy hat and dumping a quart of ice water down the back of his neck . " You call that nag a horse ? Now give me a boost up . " Rancid and I plodded through the mud back to his cabin . " Wahl , shoot , " Rancid said . " Ah had maw mouth all set fer some of Maw Tucker 's cookin ' at the jail . Durn thet Wiley ! But Ah 'll tell you what . You stay fer supper and Ah 'll fry us up some venison and gravy and biscuits . " " Sounds good to me , " I said . " You think you 'll ever get Brimstone back , Rance ? " " Oh , shore . Ah recollect the only time Ah tried to ride him . About five miles t' other side of the state line , he slowed down enough fer me to jump off . Thet offended Brimstone somethin ' awful , and him and me went four rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in a single one . Took me two days to walk back home . And thar was Brimstone , chompin ' down hay in the corral . " Three months later , March came to an end . And none too soon , either .
