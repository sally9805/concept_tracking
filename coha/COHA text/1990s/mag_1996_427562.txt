Section : BODY MAKEOVERS <p> Standing a slim 6 ' 5 " , 36-year-old Alan Mathis could be mistaken for an NBA player . But he 's more used to being called " fat boy " by childhood classmates . Living with the daily taunts of other kids , Alan turned toward food for comfort . That set the stage for years of overindulging on fast food and baked goods . Not even a diagnosis of diabetes at age 25 could change his unhealthy habits . But eight years later , a trip to the hospital sent Alan 's mind racing . He pictured his wife a widow  --  and that 's when he vowed to get healthy . <p> " In the blue-collar neighborhood that I grew up in , people were proud to be able to feed their families well . And from the looks of me , people knew that we had plenty of food and that I enjoyed lots of it . <p> It was n't unusual for me to eat 12 hot dogs while watching ball games on television . I never learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's houses , I thought they were cheap  --  or did n't know how to have fun  --  because they served such small portions . ( Now I know these were normal serving sizes . ) <p> By age 25 , I weighed 290 pounds . One day , during graduate school , I became very ill and passed out . It turned out that I was dehydrated , but I was also diagnosed with type-II diabetes . The doctors advised me to control the diabetes with proper diet , exercise and blood-sugar monitoring . To help , they gave me an American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) booklet on eating right , which I promptly tossed in a drawer when I got home . <p> After all , I thought I owned the world . Aside from this incident , I did n't feel sick or fatigued . So I continued to eat and drink what I wanted , and I did n't exercise . When I finished school , I got a good job in New York City and got married . On my honeymoon , I ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silverware . But I did n't get the hint . <p> That changed in my early 30s . I started to feel the effects of my lifestyle . I felt lousy all the time . By age 31 , I weighed 330 pounds and was taking insulin twice a day . For the next two years I did n't enjoy a single day of good health . Though I hardly did anything physical , I was constantly sweating and exhausted . I muddled through life , obese and unhealthy . Then one day I started having chest pains . I often had pains that I believed were heartburn . But this time it was worse  --  almost unbearable . I thought I was having a heart attack , so I went to the hospital . Luckily it was n't a heart attack , but a case of being totally stressed out , and it got me thinking . I realized that I could lose everything  --  my wife , my job , my life  --  if I did n't improve my health . OUT WITH THE OLD <p> On my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things : First , I dug out that old ADA booklet that had been collecting dust . Then I cleaned out the kitchen cabinets . I tossed out every type of cooking oil and fat imaginable  --  butter , mayonnaise , cheeses , chips , cookies . When I finished , I stood there looking at empty shelves , and thought , ' I 'm hungry . Now , what do I eat ? ' The only things in the refrigerator were cabbage and squash , so that 's what I had , steamed in a little water . <p> Between the ADA booklet and a video on low-fat eating , I started to make changes . Fat-free yogurt , a bagel , fruit and black coffee for breakfast . Lunch might be a bagel and tuna with mustard , lettuce and tomatoes and some fruit , a diet soda or vegetables . No more fast-food burgers and breakfast biscuits . A typical dinner consists of 12 to 16 ounces of cabbage , or another vegetable , and 2 to 3 ounces of chicken , or other lean meat or fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheese . <p> At first I went through a serious food withdrawal . Eating air-popped popcorn or ' free foods ' those with less than 20 calories or 5 grams of carbohydrate per serving like lettuce or cucumbers , which are mostly water and low fat , helped get me through the tough times . <p> Keeping a journal was key to learning sensible portions . I recorded and weighed everything . If I ordered a roasted-turkey sandwich , I 'd ask the deli guy to weigh it . I also tracked my blood sugar so I could work with my doctor to adjust my insulin doses . From the journal , I could see my progress . I became proud of what I was doing  --  and kept going . THE NEXT STEP <p> Exercise needed to be a part of my program , but it was tough to get started when merely climbing the subway stairs left me huffing and puffing . About two weeks into my new eating habits , my wife , Bridget , tricked me into exercising . She suggested walking to the bagel shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about half a mile , but it took about 40 minutes . I was wheezing , and my legs hurt . But we did it and agreed that on weekends we 'd walk to get our bagels . <p> Exercising did n't feel so great at first . But Bridget helped me keep on track . When I was feeling lazy , Bridget would n't give in . She 'd put on her exercise clothes , and when I 'd see her ready to go , I 'd get moving . Once I 'd get out there , I always enjoyed the workout . <p> It was amazing when after a month , it seemed to take only half the time to walk to and from the bagel shop . Then the walk seemed too short . So I started walking after work  --  45 minutes in the park two or three days a week . Bridget and I used our walks as a time to catch up . One day Bridget said that she was getting off the train two stops earlier than usual and walking the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sport of dodging in and out of the crowds during the mile-long walk to work . It was fun . <p> Another day , a neighbor , Ron , who 's also diabetic , suggested that Bridget and I join him and his wife at a local running track . At first we walked around the track while they ran . But soon I was running . A year later , I did my first four-mile run . We all became friends thanks to exercise . Ron and I would go jogging or walking , or the four of us would meet on weekends . But instead of cocktails , we 'd walk or run in different parks . <p> Within six months of beginning my new way of life , I stopped taking insulin . By a year , I 'd lost 105 pounds ! I took off another 25 pounds the next year . Now I weigh 201 pounds , and have lost 20-odd belt sizes . <p> At 36 , I 'm making up for all the things I missed when I was heavy  --  like dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach . It was something I always wanted to do , but physically could n't before . But that day I felt great . I did n't feel ashamed to be on the bike or wearing a bathing suit . <p> In fact , I have to admit , I even got some looks on the beach .

" It 's critical to get emotional support during times of change  --  like starting a new diet and exercise program , " he says . " You and your buddy could agree to talk once a week about weight-loss efforts or meet regularly for workouts . If you commit to doing something with another person , you 're much more likely to stick to it . " <p> Although Alan 's wife was his best buddy , some people may be more comfortable with a buddy outside of the family , says Dr. Wadden . Then they wo n't feel like they 're being watched all the time . <p> A foursome may also be a good idea . If one person misses a workout , you 'll still have some company . A threesome may leave someone feeling like the odd man out , but it could work , too . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are some ways to find one : At your workplace , put a " wanted " notice in your company newsletter . A buddy at work makes it more appealing to walk on your lunch hour . At your health club , put up a bulletin-board note . You 're sure to find a health-conscious person who 'd like to join you in regular exercise , walks or talks . At your church , synagogue or school , you could make new friends who share your interests . On the Internet , cruise to find a pal . For those who are shy , using the Internet provides a comfortable anonymity . You can find someone to talk to about diet and nutrition , but remain anonymous . <p> WRITE TO LOSE <p> " It took a few extra minutes a day , but keeping a food journal helped me become aware of how much I was eating , " says Alan Mathis . <p> Whether you 're trying to become healthier by eating low-fat foods , increasing physical activity or getting in touch with your body 's natural rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your efforts , says Dr. Thomas Wadden . A journal is like a mirror of your behavior . It helps you track where , when , what and how much you 're eating or exercising . Recording how you 're feeling is also important for getting in touch with your body and emotions . <p> Review your entries to identify high-risk situations that can sabotage your diet . For instance , if you see that every day after work when you 're feeling tired you reach for the Oreos and Haagen-Dazs , that 's a red flag . Now you can take action to avoid this pitfall . Eat an apple on the way home or have fresh veggies cut up and waiting when you come through the door . You can also use a review to find blocks of time for increasing your activity level . <p> Keeping track of workouts can keep you on track . Jot down what you did and for how long  --  walking , 30 minutes , for example . It 's a great way to see your progress and know when you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep motivated , scribble some positive thoughts throughout the journal or put your goal at the top of each page . <p>
