I am the author of a spectacularly unlucky scenario of the next 200 years , entitled A Short History of the Future , which the University of Chicago Press published in October 1989 . Just three years later , a revised second edition was issued . Why did I have to revise the future after only three years ? A funny thing happened along the way , and it provides futurists with an object lesson on the hazards of prophecy . Futurists throw the word scenario around quite a lot . Basically , a scenario is a story line : a narrative sketch of what might happen , step by step , in the near , medium , or long-term future , given certain premises about the dynamics of a particular system or process . It 's not a forecast . It 's just a projection of premises along a chronological time line to see how they might play in the real world of space and time . The kind of scenario that most impresses me  --  a historian who is also a futurist  --  is the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what will happen to a group or country or the whole human race over a period of years , cast in the form of a history textbook or monograph . The scholar works with a given set of premises about the dynamics of the systems and processes shaping the society in question : " A History of Japan , 1995-2010 , " for example , or " A History of the Middle East in the Twenty-First Century . " Future histories explore the future in much greater detail than the usual three-page scenario . They put premises through their paces much more rigorously , they show how different systems and processes interact to produce new or unexpected conjunctions , and they make use of many of the techniques of historical analysis . Most of my historian colleagues would say you ca n't possibly write the history of events that have not yet happened . But historians of the future can make full use of the knowledge and theory already available from all he social , behavioral , and natural sciences about how and why humans act as they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historians can use to construct scenarios or " treatments " ( in screenwriter parlance ) of future time . Narratives of the future necessarily read more like novels than like discursive essays , although we allow novelists more freedom of invention than we can allow futurists . The future will not necessarily consist of the specific events related in the future history , but it will consist of specific events . And it 's that sense of specificity and concreteness  --  the specificity of life as it is really lived by human beings in society rather than the specificity of statistics  --  that the scenario or the future history is uniquely qualified to convey . A SHORT HISTORY OF A SHORT HISTORY In 1989 , I had my own go at this little-known genre of futurist inquiry , publishing A Short History of the Future . My book was cast in the form of a narrative videotaped in holovision by an elderly historian as a gift to his young granddaughter in the year 2200 . My narrative painted the future in broad strokes , covering the whole world and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economics to war and culture . Every so often , I interrupted the narrative to insert imaginary documents from the private archive of my historian 's own family . I divided the future into three major epochs , roughly following Karl Marx 's vision of a coming crisis of monopoly capital resolved by a dictatorship of the working people , and , after that , the achievement of a free and classless post-historic society that has no need for coercive power . My first epoch , the immediate future , ran from the present to 2044 , marked by the global triumph of capitalism as an economic system . The rich capitalist countries and their supporters in the corporate sector carved the planet into spheres of joint domination , effectively ending the autonomy of the Third World . The second or middle epoch , from 2044 to 2147 , saw the rescue of the planet from war and injustice and environmental ruin by a social-democratic world government . But the world government eventually became arthritic and senile . In the third epoch , from 2147 into the twenty-third century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peacefully dissolved and replaced by thousands of self-governing and self-sufficient communities of all kinds . These communities live together in harmony thanks in part to the bioengineering of a more altruistic and compassionate human species by the world commonwealth in the prior epoch . New problems emerge , almost inconceivable to us today , such as the problem of gerontocracy  --  the governance of the very old in a time when people routinely live for centuries . Meanwhile , the human race colonizes the whole solar system with artificial sun-powered space habitats . Interstellar flight is perfected , and astronauts discover the ruins of an ancient civilization on the planet of another star . UNFOLDING EVENTS So far , so good . But remember , this book was published in October 1989 , which means it was written earlier  --  in fact , it was written in 1987 . It took me almost one year to land a contract and another year for the book to go through the production process , which is not one whit faster these days in spite of computerization . My last chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my last chance to make corrections in the page proofs ( by then , only minor corrections were possible ) came in the spring of 1989 . So here was a book about the future , conceived and written well before the end of the Cold War . Knowing full well that I could not foresee the future in any sort of explicit detail , knowing full well that even my premises might be seriously flawed , I deliberately refrained from mentioning anything that happened between 1989 and 1995 . The shelf life of a book is about five years  --  usually even less in the case of current-affairs books . So I did n't want to get caught anticipating the wrong outcome of the 1992 presidential elections or what have you . Who wants to pick off a shelf a book that represents itself as prophetic and find that George Bush won a second term in 1992 because of his great success in deploying a Star Wars defense shield ? In 1987 , that would have seemed quite possible , but if you 're writing a history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your narrative . So I played it safe . I started my history in 1995 . And I referred by name to no one actually alive in 1987 , with one exception  --  which brings us to my imaginary 1995 and subsequent years . In my history , Nicolae Ceausescu , dictator of Rumania ( as we spelled it in 1987 ) , died in his bed in 1995 . His regime had been so repressive that , after a brief period of confusion , a reformist faction of the Communist party in Rumania seized power from the hard-liners and began completely overhauling the political and economic system . This caused great distress to their brothers in the Soviet Union , who were up to their own necks in problems and did not need any back talk from the Rumanians . The Soviets began to lean on Bucharest , and the rest of the world smelled trouble . By the beginning of 1997 , it was obvious that something was about to pop . Early that same year , a successful push by Communist rebels in the Philippines prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington opted for a quick , clean victory and immediately threw into combat all the American sea , air , and ground forces it thought it would possibly need to win the war . The Americans fought the rebels to a standstill in six murderous months , but failed to achieve victory . Meanwhile , back in Rumania , the situation worsened all through the spring and summer of 1997 . In late summer , Soviet troops amassed on the Rumanian frontier With the happy consent of Bucharest , neighboring Yugoslavia sent its best divisions into Rumania to help stave off a Soviet invasion . The Soviets thought they would have a free hand in a Balkan conflict because the United States was still tied up in the Pacific , but Washington abruptly changed course . Deciding that it had done all it could in the Philippines , and with victory still elusive , the United States abandoned the Filipinos to their fate . America pulled out  --  even closed its air force and naval bases in the Philippines  --  and sent its best battle-hardened Marines and sailors and aviators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but really to intimidate Moscow . Things got steadily worse until , for the first time in the history of the Cold War , Soviet and U.S. troops were glaring at one another across an international boundary line and preparing to fire . The U.S. forces , armed with tactical nukes , including neutron bombs , stood ready to strike . In fact , a few shots were exchanged before cooler heads prevailed . The superpowers managed to scare one another out of their wits on that grim day in September 1997 . They had been just inches , just minutes , away from World War III . So they declared a truce . By mutual accord , U.S. and Soviet forces went home . And out of this crisis came the great Vienna Conference of 1998 , which , to ensure peace and quiet in Europe , decided to remove all the armed forces of the NATO powers and the Soviet Union from the two Germanies , East and West . This finally put an end to the Cold War . FUTURE HISTORY AMID HISTORIC CHANGE From the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , all this sounded more or less believable . And , as you know , bits of it came true : Ceausescu did die , and there was a big upheaval in Romania ( post-Cold War spelling ) led by a reformist faction of the Communist party . The United States did abandon its bases in the Philippines . There was ( and still is ) a war in the Balkans involving Yugoslavia . The Cold War did come to an end . But remember , my publication date was October 1989 . What a rotten time for a book about the future to hit the libraries and bookstores ! The world was changing so fast that nobody could keep up with it , much less anticipate the next turn of the wheel . A few comparisons : * In my book , events took place in a single great planetary spasm between 1995 and 1998 . In the real world , events took place in a single great planetary spasm between 1989 and 1992 , with the Balkan aftermath still unresolved and a lot more trouble apparently in store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former Soviet Union . * In my book , the Soviet Union does not disintegrate until 2044 . In the real world , it departed the scene , along with the Warsaw Pact , in 1991. * In my book , the Communist political system also survives down to 2044 , although it adopts a semi-capitalist economic policy ( about the same as what Deng Xiaoping 's China is doing today ) and then gets thoroughly swept up and ground up in the capitalist world economy . In the real world , the Communist political system was dumped almost overnight , although it may yet stage some kind of comeback if economic conditions do not improve soon . * In my book , Ceausescu 's death in 1995 precipitated the overthrow of Communist power in Romania . In the real world , he was executed six years earlier after failing to hold power . * In my book , a great Balkan crisis precipitated the end of the Cold War . In the real world , it resulted from the end of the Cold War . All things considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book written in 1987 and published in 1989 . But what I failed to anticipate  --  what everyone failed to anticipate  --  was the extraordinarily rapid pace of events in the real world in 1989 and thereafter  --  events that changed the geopolitical map of the world fundamentally and permanently in what , for historians , is the blink of an eye . The unforeseen and virtually unforeseeable events of 1989 changed not only the world of 1989 , but also the world of 1995 . LESSONS FOR FUTURE HISTORIANS Here , then , is an object lesson in the hazards of prophecy  --  hazards that crop up no matter what method of futures research you employ but can cause special embarrassment in the case of scenarios , and even more so in the case of histories of the future . By their very nature , histories of the future must contain very specific imaginary information strung out along a very explicit chronological time line . The researcher can and should make clear to readers that the events depicted in a scenario or future history are not intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us has , or perhaps ever will have , the power to predict the future in this sense . Nevertheless , future histories do look like predictions . They have the smell and the feel and the taste of straight-line forecasting . But they are not forecasts . Future histories are exercises involving premises about the dynamics of social systems . They are analogous to computer models of the world into which various numerical values are fed to see how , under given programmed assumptions , the computer will map their interactions and consequences . An example is the celebrated MIT study described in The Limits to Growth . Future histories , like computer models , are experiments , not replicas . My story has a relatively happy ending . In 1991 , Chicago Press gave me the green light to produce a revised edition of A Short History of the Future . I took advantage of their generosity , and the result was a second , paperbound version of the book , which appeared in late 1992 . In the new Short History , the narrative begins in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1990 , and 1991 ) exactly right . Then I refer vaguely to the confused and troubled 1990s , mumble a bit , and re-commence the narrative in detail with events of the year 2000 . East-West superpower rivalry , crucial to the first edition , is replaced in the second by North-South rivalry , in which the United States eventually changes sides . Here are some of the chief lessons to be learned from my experience in future historiography . The first lesson is the need to educate the reader . I wrote something in my introduction to the first edition about the difference between prediction and scenario writing , but not enough . I might even have been able to weave this point somehow into the main text . In histories of the future , the future is imagined in concrete details  --  none of which is ever likely to happen in just that way  --  because you need the details to make your scenario credible as a narrative , to give it the texture of real life The second lesson is that writers of future histories should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , varying their premises or the impacts of different factors . This is hard to do , because a future history should be a substantial effort , occupying not two or three pages , but two or three hundred . The future historian can not give a sense of all the interactions and synergies involved if he or she is confined to a few thousand words . But any serious future historian should be able to construct at least two and maybe three or four alternative parallel narratives . My third and last lesson is : Do n't worry too much about being " wrong . " In fact , writers of scenarios and future historians should dare to be wrong . They should n't always play it safe . Mindless extrapolations from present-day trends may satisfy more editors and readers , but they stand little or no chance of catching the anomalies and sudden left or right turns that punctuate the pages of history and are more or less inevitable in the future , too . If you put your finger on something really significant that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or at least forgiven . Imagination can yield insights that are out of reach for hard-boiled , literal-minded trend-surfers . Imagination needs space and air and freedom to work its magic . I am constantly reminded of this whenever I contemplate the career of H.G. Wells , the foremost futurist of all time . His nonfictional futures books and articles contain some prescient material , but he scored his greatest triumphs in his science-fiction novels and future histories . For example , in an article written early in 1939 , he said nothing about a coming world war , but in The Shape of Things to Come , a future history written in 1933 , he accurately foresaw that World War II would start on the Polish-German border . Unfortunately , few people have tried their hands at writing future histories . We as futurists are missing the boat here . Some future histories , like Sir John Hackett 's The Third World War , have become best sellers . People read history because it 's more fun , more accessible , more real than , say , sociology or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , not the Sociology Book Club . Futurists should exploit this popular hunger for history , and in the process I think they will also become better , more imaginative , more creative futurists . ABOUT THE AUTHOR W.
