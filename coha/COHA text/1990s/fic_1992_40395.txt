My mother is standing on her porch . May 10 , 1991 . Early morning and the street is quiet now , as peaceful as it gets here , as peaceful as it always stays in other neighborhoods , invisible , not a half mile away behind the tree-topped ridge that separates Tokay , Susquehanna , Dunfermline , Seagirt from their neighbors to the west . The litany of streets always sweet on my tongue . I think I murmur their names , a silence unless you are inside my skull , sing them as a kind of background music that does n't break the quiet of morning . If I 'm not reciting them to myself , I hear the names anyway coming from somewhere else , a place that also knows what lies within the sound of these streets said to oneself again and again . Footsteps , voices , a skein of life dragged bead by bead through a soft needle 's eye . And knows the names of streets can open like the gates of a great city , everyone who 's ever inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shimmer , like the first notes of a Monk solo , breathing , moving , a world quickens as the gates swing apart . And knows my mother is not alone on her porch this May morning . Knows she hears beneath the stillness enveloping her the sound of street names , what is animated when they are recalled . The presence of other souls as palpable as light playing in the edges of her robe . Her mother and father and children . Her brother and sisters . Grands and great-grands . The man I have become and those whom I 've lost becoming him . The song of street names a medium in which we all float , suspended , as if each of us is someone 's precious , precious child who must never be allowed to slip from the arms cradling , rocking . And knows my mother is listening to time , time voiced in no man-made measurements of days or minutes or years , time playing as it always must , background or foreground or taking up all the space we have , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footstep she 's ever heard or dreamed . <p> I 'm afraid for her . Experience one of those moments of missing her intensely , her gone , final good-byes said , though she is here , just ten feet away , through the front-door screen , framed by two of the rusty wrought-iron columns supporting the roof . A moment where fear of losing her overwhelms me to such an extent that I am bereft , helpless , unconsoled even by her presence , one price I pay for other moments when she 's thousands of miles away and I 've needed her and she is there , there beside me . After nine months of chemo her hair has grown in again , softer , curlier . Many shades of bushy gray and a crown of lighter hair , nearly white , nearly spun to invisibility by morning . I 'm aware as I seldom am of her dimensions , how tall , how wide , how much this woman on the porch with her newborn 's hair weighs . I need what is tangible , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like frail and vulnerable I ca n't help saying to myself , words popping up though I try not to think them . I hate words with the power to take her away . Frail . Old . The effort of denying them makes her disappear anyway . My eyes cross Tokay , counting cobblestones as they go , remarking the incredible steepness of the street slanting out of my field of vision , the broken curbs and littered gutters , settling on the gigantic tree islanded in the delta where Seagirt and Tokay converge and Bricelyn begins . If the downtown wedge of skyscrapers where three rivers meet is the city 's Golden Triangle , this could be its Green Triangle . A massive tree centuries old holds out against the odds here across from my mother 's house , one of the biggest trees in Pittsburgh , anchored in a green tangle of weeds and bushes , trunk thick as a Buick , black as night after rain soaks its striated hide . Huge spread of its branches canopies the foot of the hill where the streets come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's front porch . If it ever tore loose from its moorings , it would crush her house like a sledgehammer . As big as it is , its roots must run under her cellar . The sound of it drinking , lapping nourishment deep underground , is part of the quiet when her house is empty . How the tree survived a city growing around it is a mystery . For years no more than a twig , a sapling , a switch someone could have snapped off to beat a balky animal , swat a child 's behind . I see a dark fist exploding through the asphalt , thrusting to the sky , the fingers opening , multiplying , fanning outward to form a vast umbrella of foliage . The arm behind it petrifies , other thick limbs burst from knots of hardened flesh , each one duplicating the fan of leaves , the delicate network of branches , thinning , twisting as they climb higher and farther from the source . Full-blown in a matter of seconds , ready to stand here across from my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the twinkling of an eye , just the way it arrived . <p> I did n't say any of this to my mother as I pushed through the screen door with my cup of coffee to join her on the porch . Then it was just one quiet thing after the other , a matter of seconds , the sight of her standing still , her back to me , me thinking thoughts that flashed at warp speed but would take forever to unpack , the door creaking , her turning slowly toward the noise , You up Baby , a quick welcoming smile before she turns back to whatever it was , wherever she was gazing when I saw her first , small , bathed in the soft , remorseless light of morning , when I heard the sound of Homewood street names playing , transforming a commonplace scene into something else , restoring the invisible omnipresence of time , the enabling medium , what brought you to this moment and will carry you away , how things begin and end , always , you about to step out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something , somewhere , home again , morning again , steamy coffee mug in one hand , sure of what you will do next , your fingers press the door frame , pushing , absolutely unsure , fearing what will happen next , wondering what 's in her eyes , behind them this morning in May , and which ghosts crowd the porch , regretting her privacy you are invading with yours . Who will the two of you together summon if you steal her attention , if you are ready and willing to offer yours , if you can break away from the tune over and over in your head and maybe in hers of the street names , sorrow and loss in every syllable when you say them to yourself the way you must to locate yourself here , back home in Pittsburgh this morning , Tioga Susquehanna Seagirt Cassina , praying your mother wo n't move , wo n't be gone before you reach her . <p> You hug each other . Not hard , not soft . Briefly . Long enough to remember everything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the gas station . At Braddock and Penn . You know . The two big stations across from each other . A white guy in Mickey Mouse Bermudas . He said these had n't been out in the sun . Too much direct sun 's not good for them , he said . These were shoved under a folding table he had set up . Pansies or some other kind , I forget . They just looked pretty to me and I thought you 'd like something pretty and growing . <p> Impatiens . They 're beautiful . <p> And you already have a hook by the door to hang them . <p> I used to keep a few little plants out here . Then one night just before Easter the flowers grew feet . Woke up one morning and everybody 's flowers were gone . I only had a couple nice little plants . Nothing special . But they were gone just like everybody else 's up and down both blocks . Flowers grew feet that night and walked away . <p> You mean somebody ripped off people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house with the green and white aluminum awning . That 's Eva 's . You know who I mean , do n't you . Small brown-skinned woman always dressed nice . Used to ride the bus to town with me to work . Eva had big-time flowers on her porch . Gone that morning like everybody else 's and Eva 's fit to be tied . She said she was marching down to the corner and beat the black off him with her own two hands if she caught him with one of her flowers . Said she 'd know her flowers if she saw them , pot or no pot or new pot she 'd know her own flowers and strangle him with her bare hands if she caught him with her flowers . <p> Somebody selling flowers on the corner . Right there on Bennett . Day after the night the flowers walked . <p> No . You got to be kidding . <p> Huh-uh . Some guy down there big as life selling flowers . Had his stand right on Bennett and Bricelyn . No pots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't completely crazy . A flower sale the day after everybody 's flowers disappeared off their porches . <p> He 's lucky he did n't get shot . <p> Eva said she was going down there and look for her flowers . Tear him up if she found any . But how could you know for sure . I kinda looked for mine when I passed by that way , but he had everything tied up in plastic bags of dirt so how you supposed to tell . Flowers are flowers . Eva swore she 'd know hers , but I did n't notice any commotion down there . Did his business all day . Gone next morning . Walked away like the flowers walked . Never saw the guy before . Do n't care if I ever see him again . <p> A brazen brother . <p> That 's how they do us . Steal anything and everything . Stained-glass windows out the church . I worry about one of them getting into the house . <p> Sorry-assed junkies . <p> Dope turns them crazy . Knock you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched grow up around here . I do n't believe they intend to hurt anybody , but when that sickness is down on them , my , my , my , they 'll do anything . I shudder when I think of your brother crazy that way . Him hurting someone or someone hurting him . Those so-called friends of his he 'd bring home . Yes ma'am and no ma'am me and all the time I know their dope eyes counting up what they could come back and steal . Tommy knew it , too . God have mercy on me for saying this about my own son , but I believe now that 's why he brought some of them around . To steal from me . <p> Coffee 's not hot . Not cold . I try the porch railing with my hand . It feels solid enough . I remember helping Wade from next door mix concrete for the porch . The good feel of doing hard work with my brothers , the three of us , Dave , Ote , and me , Wade 's crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold Iron City break we all felt the presence of the brother missing who should be with us building this porch for our mother . I sit on the rail anchored in our concrete . Ask about Wade . <p> Poor man had a tough year . Dog died , wife died , he hit that paperboy . Old Wade was way down . Said he would n't have made it if it had n't been for the boy 's parents . They did n't blame him . People who witnessed the accident said Wade never had a chance . Going normal speed . The boy rode his bike straight into Wade 's car . And thank goodness Wade was on his way to work . So he had n't been drinking . Wade said if the parents had blamed him for the boy 's death , he would n't have pulled through . <p> Dog died . Wife died . That 's a rather strange order to put things in , Mother dear . <p> You know what I mean . Did n't mean one thing worse than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean anything like that . <p> I 'm just teasing . <p> Teasing your fuddle-brained old mother . I know . I know most the time nobody understands what I 'm talking about . Half the time do n't know my own self . Pay me no mind . I did n't intend any disrespect . Wade loved Nadine dearly and misses her terribly . Loved that raggedy , stump-tailed dog too . It was just one terrible thing after another falling on the poor man . I do n't know how he survived . Thought for a while he was going to drink himself to death . But he 'd clean up every morning and drive off to work . Wade 's a strong man . A good man too , in his way . <p> Sounds like he was Job last year . <p> I prayed for him . All alone in his house . I know how that feels , rattling around in a house all by yourself . <p> The porch is holding up fine , is n't it . A little crack by the glider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be here awhile . You'all did quite a job . <p> Wade the only one who knew what he was doing . Me and Dave and Ote supplied the muscle . <p> It was one hot day . I was worried about you'all . None of you used to working out in the broiling sun that way . <p> Little sweat mixed in the cement makes it stronger , last longer . Why you think the Pyramids been standing all these centuries . Good African blood gluing the stones . <p> What do you think about this idea going around that Egyptians were black . <p> Better late than never , Mom . I guess . Most of them a mixture of black Africans and brown Asiatics . Look at what part of the world we 're talking about . Look at them today . Not exactly a matter of color , though . More about culture . People migrating and invading and mixing since the dawn of time . Everybody 's a mongrel . The wonder is it 's taken this long for the obvious to be said out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still resisted in some quarters . <p> I try to change the faces of the people in the Bible . I ca n't do it . They still look like the faces I saw in Sunday school , in the little picture books we had to study from . No black faces , except for that one dark wiseman with Jesus in the manger . When I close my eyes , I still ca n't put black faces on the Bible people . <p> Well , we must of had the same books when I was in Sunday school . Maybe that 's one reason you had to drag me . Child abuse every Sunday morning . <p> Bit more child abuse might not have been a bad idea . I felt terrible knowing I was raising a bunch of little heathens . <p> Anyway , what I started to say is we used those same jive comic books , but the Bible people never were white to me . They never had a color , really . The funny-looking robes and beards and turbans stuck in my mind . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of when I think of Bible days and Bible stories . Him up on the pulpit of A.M.E. Zion shouting and strutting and banging his big fist . Old Frank Felder black as coal and that 's the color of everything he preached . Like his voice tarbrushed the Bible . If the faces in the books were n't black it did n't matter cause black was in charge , telling the story . <p> I did think of Job more than once when I prayed for Wade . And I guess Job surely did have Wade 's face , and Wade 's face , God bless him , surely is n't white . Poor man bent down under all his burdens . I needed the story of Job to understand how Wade could handle it . Strength to bear up to the worst , no matter what , has to come from somewhere . I needed God and Job . Needed them both to understand how Wade survived what he did . <p> You know , Mom , people look at you and what you 've had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them as you say Wade is to you . <p> God does n't give you more than you can handle . <p> Not everybody has that kind of god . <p> I worry about your brother . Where will he turn now . He 's still a Muslim , is n't he . He still goes by his Muslim name . <p> Told me not long ago he 's not as active in the group as he once was . But he does pray . Not as regular as he once did , he says , but he keeps the faith . <p> I hope he has something . Because this last blow . The parole board turning him down again without a hearing . He believed they 'd almost have to let him go . Did n't see how they could say no again . <p> They say whatever they want to say . <p> Other times he held something back . In his heart of course he hoped they 'd give him a chance , believed he 'd earned a chance , but like you say . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do what they want to do . Every time but this he 's held something back to fight the no . <p> He 's in danger now . Like when he was first locked up and wild and determined to tear the prison apart with his bare hands . Worse now because he 's on his own . No crew of young wild ones like him fighting back . All he has is us . And we 're out here . All he has really is the chance anybody has . To keep pushing on and try to make something of a life , whatever . <p> Do n't think I can go with you today . I 'm too shaky today to face that evil prison . Tell him I 'll come next week with Denise and Chance . <p> Do n't want to leave you if you 're feeling badly . <p> I 'll be all right here . You go talk to your brother . It 's just one of those days . I 'll take my pills and sit myself down awhile . I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just one of those not so good days . I 'm shaky . I have bad days every now and then . Hug him for me . Tell him I love him . I 'll be fine here . <p> I rise with her . The porch one of those quiet , extra-wide , featureless elevators in the hospital where she goes Tuesdays for treatments . Below us the map of streets , veins , arteries . We wait on this floor , at this height . The porch rocks like a Ferris wheel car stopped at the apex of the ride . Perhaps the huge motor 's broken . Cable snapped . Gears stripped . We wait and listen for music to drift up from the streets . <p> My brother 's arms are prison arms . The kind you see in the street that clue you where a young brother 's been spending his time . Bulging biceps , the rippled look of ropy sinews and cords of muscle snaking around the bones . Skinned . Excess flesh boiled away in this caldron . Must be noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the prison yard . Metal clanking . Grunts and groans . Iron pumped till shoulders and chests swell to the bursting point . Men fashioning arms thick enough to wrestle fate , hold off the pressure of walls and bars always bearing down . Large . Big . Nothing else to do all day . Size one measure of time served . Serious time . The body 's cycle of growth and decay frozen in the stop-time perfection of a steel-plated physique , beyond wear and tear , vulnerability or pain . Muscles expand and contract , expand , contract , and the prisoners ride this seesaw till they lie like dazed children sprawled in their sun-scoured playground . <p> Hot today in the visiting area , fiery heat like the day we paddled round in Wade 's cement . Row row row your concrete boat . It ai n't heavy , it 's your brother . <p> Hey , bro , I 'd be the last one to deny I 'm fucked up . We both know good and well I 've had problems all my life doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this godforsaken hole if anybody needs proof I could n't handle . Something 's wrong wit me , man , but the people who runs this joint , something 's real wrong wit them too . <p> Pressure in my face muscles from the permanent squint I 'm wearing to keep sun out of my eyes . A mask of age . Forehead furrowed , cheeks tensed and hollow , eyes narrow , tiny creases incised at their comers , vision dimmed by the hazy porch of lashes and brow pouting to shade the eyes . Sun cooks my right side . I look past my brother to avoid the direct glare , beyond him to the bricks of the visiting-room wall , the glass doors opening to this open-air enclosure where we sit . <p> I listen closely but he 's a blur in the center of the space across the round table where my eyes would naturally focus if I was n't hiding from the sun . I do n't need to see him . He will be wearing the same face I am . Pinched and sweaty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than me to fix on , so what I say is a voice-over , as his is to me , listening while I tour the stones stacked forty feet high that surround us , the glass doors black as water , reflecting scraps of the yard . <p> Motherfuckers do n't say shit for three months . Know I 'm on pins and needles every minute of every day since I filed my commutation papers , but do n't nobody say one god-blessed single solitary word good or bad for three months . I 'm going crazy wit the waiting . And too scared to ask anybody what 's happening cause you know how that works . Ask a question and they say no just to spite you , just to get you out their face . Limbo , man , for three months . Then last week I 'm by the desk in the visiting room waiting for Denise and Chance and the guard at the desk hands me the phone , call for you . Lieutenant 's on the line and he says to me Board turned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to him now or check by his office later . That 's it . Boom . Turn down . <p> Like getting hit in the chest wit a hammer . Could n't breathe , man . Still ca n't breathe right . Felt like somebody had taken a hammer and whammed me in the heart . <p> No warning . No explanation . I 'm standing in the visiting room trying to catch my breath and Denise and the baby be in here in a minute . Dying , man , and ready to die . My life was over soon 's the lieutenant said Board turned you down . <p> Weird thing is the night before I had a dream . Woke me up . Could n't go back to sleep . Dreamed I was in one the offices around here and my papers was on the desk . My papers . What I 'd been waiting for all these months and finally there they sat . On top the desk and nobody else around . All I had to do was peep at the last sheet , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes or no . Could n't believe it be this easy . So much waiting and praying and begging and cursing boneheads out cause they would n't give me a clue . Would n't tell me nothing , nothing , and now alls I had to do was turn to the last page and I 'd know . <p> Awful thing was I already knew the answer . Could n't peep at the bottom sheet cause I already knew . Knew in my heart so I kept standing , staring , too scared to read what I knew I 'd find . <p> Right when the dream ended I did look . Could n't hold out . Looked and saw denied stamped on the last page . Whole dream came back to me soon as I put down that phone in the visiting room . Been denied all along . And all along I guess I knowed . <p> Nothing for three months , then I 'm waiting for a visit from my old lady and son and I get a phone call . Turned you down , Wideman . Bam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me that ai n't evil , man . Saying no is bad enough . They do n't have to treat people like dirt saying it . <p> My own fault I 'm in here . I know I done some bad things . I 'm in here , man , doing my time . Uh-huh . Hard time . Lots of time for doing wrong . But they treat us like dog shit in here and that 's wrong too . Guys get killed in here . Go crazy . But nobody cares . Long as they keep us locked up they can do us anyway they want . Figure we in here , so they do n't owe us nothing . But wrong is wrong , ai n't it . Just cause we down , is it right to keep on kicking us . Guys get meaner and crazier in here . Every day you see the ones ca n't take it slipping further and further off . Distance in their eyes , bro . Ai n't nobody home in them eyes . They shuffle around here like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Gone , man . If you been around here any length of time you seen it happen to a lot of guys . You understand how easy it is to tune out and drop off the edge into your own little world . Another planet . You see why guys go off . Why they so cold and mean if they ever hit the street again . <p> Now our eyes are meeting . The sun 's part of the meeting . A sting , a rawness you try to blink away but only make worse as sweat drips and irritates . Only one other table occupied when you sat down at yours . Now no free ones . The visiting-room wall forms one end of the outdoor enclosure . Its other three walls rise forty feet at least , smooth blocks of stone topped by razor wire , a walkway , a guard tower in the far corner . At the base of the sheer stone walls fresh plantings , shrubbery dense and spiky bordering the concrete pavement . A few trees , also recently planted , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a square collar of earth the size of a missing section of paving . You register these details for later . You think it will be crucial at some point to remember this yard exactly . You are uncertain why . Then , still listening to what he 's saying , you realize how little of your brother 's life you can share . This yard , detail by detail , is part of what you do share . You would be compromised if you come away with only a vague recollection . To fight this place , to force it to disappear , you must not miss anything . The map of it in your head makes its horror real , but also is what you must depend upon to plan an escape . <p> I think I 'm finally beginning to understand why they so evil to us . They 're scared of the black man . Really scared . More scared than I ever knew . More scared than they know themselves . When I first come in the joint I knew something about the fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was we did n't give them no chance to run game on us . We had learned the hard way coming up running the streets what they thought of us . Crazy killers . Animals . Dope fiends . Niggers you got to lock up or kill before they kill you . That was the deal . So we played the hand dealed us . We was stone outlaws . Fuck wit us you better be prepared to take us down cause if you do n't we coming down on you . I was young and hot-blooded and that cowboy and Indian gangster shit okay wit me . Bring it on . Let 's git down and dirty . Rock and roll . We saw fear in their eyes . We fucked with them to keep it there . But they did n't kill me and , all praise to Allah , I did n't kill a guard . I changed . Was n't really me in the first place . I was just playing the outlaw role I thought I needed to play to survive the joint . I changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for keeping them scared . My buddy Rick . You remember Ricky from up the hill on Tokay . Took him dying make me really understand what I 'm telling you now . You know he got sick in here . Come in when I did , one of our wild bunch . Take no shit from nobody , none of us . But Rick changed , too . Wised up . Then he got sick , real sick , like I said . They would n't treat him . Would n't try to find out what was wrong . Why should they . If you scared of somebody , why you gon try and help them , fix them up , make them well so they can jump in your chest again . Huh-uh . Ricky just rotted . Chased him away from the clinic . Or handed him a aspirin . You know the story . He shrunk down to nothing . Ninety-three goddamn pounds . Finally they had to stick him in the clinic . Let him rot in the clinic till his mother got to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bed in a locked ward in a real hospital and diagnosed stomach cancer . By that time Ricky too far gone to help . Drugged him up so he just nodded away . Did n't know people when they came to see him , his mother said . Said he was so weak they unchained him . A cop in the room when she visited , but Ricky just laying there . A pitiful sight , plugged up to machines , not even recognizing his own mama . She was in a chair beside his bed on a Sunday , she said it must have been Sunday cause she 'd been there a couple hours that afternoon and she works during the week so it must of been Sunday and Rick been sleeping like he always did the whole time so she was just sitting half sleep herself when Ricky 's hand reached over and patted hers where she 'd laid it on the blanket . She could n't believe it , she said . Tears started rolling down her cheeks , she told me , because what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . Too far gone to get better so she just knew Rick using his last strength to say good-bye . <p> The cop in the room had a different idea . See , he was still scared of Ricky so Ricky moving that hand meant Ricky was dangerous again . Cop jumped up and started refastening the chains . <p> None of it makes any goddamn sense . Who they keep . Who they let go . Never give you any reasons . They do n't have to give reasons for what they do . They just do it . Denied . They stamp your papers denied and that 's all the reason they got to give . Denied . <p> One the dudes they did n't deny , a white boy , he busted out of here not too long ago . Busted out and stayed out till he got tired of running and turned hisself in . Escaped the joint , man , and now they granted him a hearing with the full parole board . What kind of sense do it make . <p> Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply next time . <p> Do n't think I ai n't thought about it . Been keeping my eye on that tree over there . Shimmy up , leap over to the wall . Gone . <p> Not much of a tree yet . <p> Yeah , well , it 's still pretty scraggly . But I been watching it . <p> Long time before those branches grow as high as the wall . And you 'd still have a pretty good leap . <p> Guys in here would try . Plenty of them . Scoot up that tree in a minute . Do a super monkey jump . <p> Branches awful skinny at the top . Even for a monkey <p> Right . Right . Skinny enough so you get up there it 'll bend to the wall . Ride it like a surfboard . <p> You got it all figured out , bro . <p> Told you I 've been keeping my eye on that little tree . <p> This is where you and Denise were when the leaf got out . <p> At the table closest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there but by the time that leaf blew up near the top of the wall both of us on our feet cheering . Other people had got into it , too . Saw what we was watching and that leaf had a whole lot of fans when it sailed over the wall . Would have thought people cheering for the Steelers or somebody 's lottery number hit . Was n't nothing but a leaf me and Denise noticed that had started blowing higher and higher . Each time the wind would grab it , it would circle up higher . Over in that corner like it was riding a draft or a whirlwind or some damn something keeping it up . You know how something dumb catch your attention and you ca n't let it go . Leaf kept spinning round and round and rising each time it spinned . Like on a yo-yo . After watching it awhile you know that leaf has flying out of here on its mind . Every little whip and twist and bounce starts to matter . Before you know it you 're blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know something inside you will be hurt if that silly leaf ca n't finish what it started . Whole visiting yard whooping and hollering when it finally blew over the wall . <p> Denise cried . And damn . It was everything I could do to keep the tears out of my eyes . Everybody in here needed that leaf to go free . <p> Kind of magic , man , if you was here in the yard and seen it . Know I sound dumb trying to tell you how it was . But that 's how it was . Specially for Denise and me cause earlier in the visit she told me she was carrying my baby . We 'd already picked names : Chance Mandela if it was a boy . Could n't help taking the leaf as a sign . <p> Chance because the odds were stacked against him ever being conceived , let alone born . Million to one , bro . And Mandela cause Mandela 's my man . You know . In the joint like me but still taking care of business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was born the day after Mandela walked out of prison , I could n't believe it . <p> Little day late rascal . But my little guy was close . Real close . Bust out right behind Nelson . <p> The leaf , the day , the name . Pretty amazing , little brother . Has to be a sign . Gives you something special to fight for . A son , a family . You 've come too far to let this denial turn you around . <p> I think a lot about it . Everything I mean . When I 'm alone at night in my cell . Ai n't never really alone no more since they double-bunking everybody , but you know what I mean . When I think about giving up , truth is , nothing but me can pull me back from the edge . I got to do it for me . No matter how much I love Chance and Denise and Mom and you'all , nothing , not all the love in the world , can fill the hole that opens up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save myself is to do it for me . I got to be the reason . I got to be worth saving . Ca n't live a life for nobody else . Nobody can live one for me . You understand what I 'm saying . <p> I 'm trying . <p> The leaf . I told you how it finally blowed free overtop the wall . Could n't see it no more . Denise grabbed my hand . She was crying and we was bouncing up and down . People shouting . Some even clapped . But you know something . I 'm gon na tell you something I do n't tell nobody when I tell about the leaf . The dumb thing blew back in here again . <p> John Edgar Wideman 's most recent book , the novel Philadelphia Fire , won the 1991 Pen/Faulkner Award .
