It was hard to imagine two more unlikely or reluctant witnesses . On one side of the divide was Anita Hill , 35 , a specialist in the dry area of commercial law , a reserved woman who by all accounts is given more to listening than to talking . On the other was Clarence Thomas , 43 , a courtly man who from his college days has enjoyed a reputation for treating women with particular courtesy and respect . Yet there she was , this prim law professor from the University of Oklahoma , seated in the glare of klieg lights before the Senate Judiciary Committee , calmly detailing graphic charges of sexual harassment against the man who until last week seemed virtually certain to be confirmed as the next Justice to the Supreme Court . <P> He said , " I have not said or done the things Anita Hill has alleged . " <P> She said , " I am not given to fantasy . This is not something I would have come forward with if I was not absolutely sure of what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there in the Senate Caucus Room or at home in their living rooms , deciding who was telling the truth was all but impossible . Viewers had to weigh the testimony of two admirable people  --  both of whom had escaped , through diligence and perseverance , a background of rural poverty to scale great heights , both of whom are known to be grounded in strong religious and spiritual values , both of whom have reputations for great personal integrity  --  and pronounce one of them a liar . In the final analysis , it would come down to this : the specificity of Hill 's charges against the intensity of Thomas ' denials . <P> Before the days of exhausting and exhaustive testimony would end , Hill would coolly and impassively detail the nature of Thomas ' alleged harassment while she worked for him in government positions from 1981 to 1983 . Words like " penis " and " breasts " and " pubic hair " would enter the public record repeatedly in so somber and untitillating a fashion that no one in the hearing room would blanch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the differences in the Hill and Thomas versions on what transpired a decade ago were not a simple matter of differing sensibilities  --  oversqueamishness on her part vs. bad taste on his . If Hill 's description of Thomas ' words and actions was truthful , then the Supreme Court nominee was guilty of sexual harassment in the past and perjury in the present . If Hill 's account was a flight of fantasy , then she was delusional and a candidate for medical attention . <P> During Saturday 's session , Republican Senator Orrin Hatch aimed squarely at the accuser , implying that Hill was working in tandem with " slick lawyers " bent on destroying Thomas ' chances to join the court . Thomas appeared to endorse that view when committee chairman Joseph Biden asked if he believed that Hill had fabricated a tale of sexual harassment . " Some interest groups came up with this story , and this story was developed specifically to destroy me , " the nominee responded .                @ @ @ @ @
