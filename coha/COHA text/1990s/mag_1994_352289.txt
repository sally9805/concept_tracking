Hubris  --  a kind of convulsive , ambitious pride  --  was the tragic flaw in many a Greek hero , but it is life 's blood to theater people . What else gives them the courage to put epic dreams on a bare stage , to evoke ancient empires with only words and a few props ? Arrogance is the mother of theatrical invention , and the spur to Douglas C. Wager 's new production of Derek Walcott 's The Odyssey at the Arena Stage in Washington . <P> Walcott , the Nobel-winning West Indian poet whose 8,000-line Omeros hijacked Homer to the Caribbean , here packs the major events of the Odyssey into three brisk hours and still has room for his voluptuous metaphor making and severe truth telling ( " What are men ? Children who doubt " ) . After a slow start , in which stilted heroic attitudes virtually define Bad Regional Theater , Odysseus appears , in the burly , assured person of Casey Biggs , and the play takes off . Mythology can be fun when Circe is a sassy dominatrix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Helen of Troy is a peckish , past-her-prime star who puts on airs  --  Bea Arthur trying to be Bea Lillie . All this to Galt $ MacDermot 's bouncy , familiar music  --  it could be played in the lobby at a Club Med hotel . <P> When this Odyssey gets going , it 's not just an adventure ; it 's a trip . Anything from flowers to fire may pop out of the sunburnt-orange floorboards . A stormy sea comes to roiling life with just a tilted spar and a few sprawling actors . By the end , the Arena has become a playroom filled with spritely wonder .
