If the solar system has a glamour world , Jupiter  --  with its brilliant colors , vast size and fruit fly-like swarm of 16 moons  --  has always been it . The planet appeared more elegant still in 1979 , when the Voyager space probes discovered that it is circled by a fine set of nested rings . <P> No one knew the origin of the Jovian rings , but astronomers assumed they were either the pulverized remains of a small moon that had been destroyed by a collision or the raw material of an incipient moon that had never had the gravitational muscle to pull itself together . Last week they reached a different conclusion . New images returned by the Galileo spacecraft reveal that the fairy-dust bands are debris blasted into space when the planet 's four innermost moons were struck by meteors . <P> The quartet of small satellites ought to have been elusive targets for incoming debris . Orbiting so close to Jupiter , however , they lay in the path of any projectiles drawn in by the planet 's gravity . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that follows the moons like smokestack exhaust . <P> While such a bombardment process had been considered by scientists , it was accepted only after recent pictures were analyzed . They showed that the ring material indeed appears to flow from the rump end of the moons , and that the moons and rings orbit the planet at identical angles . " We have a definitive answer to the origin of this ring system , " says Michael Belton , leader of the Galileo imaging team . <P> That answer has meaning not only for Jupiter but also for Uranus and Neptune , which have their own satellites and their own faint bands . Around those planets , little moons have likely taken a similar pounding and decorated their parent worlds in a similar way . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
