When a long-suffering and enlightened IBD patient tried the Australian " ulcer cure " and found herself without symptoms for eight months , she called Dr. Barry Marshall , who foxed the good news to the Post . <p> Editor 's note : Just as we went to press , a fax arrived from Australia with news of Dr. Mary Stolberg , who suffered for 13 years with IBD and had , in desperation , tried Barry Marshall 's regimen for treating stomach ulcers . <p> To her astonishment , her ever-present , painful Crohn 's colitis symptoms promptly disappeared . Now , after eight months of complete remission , she decided to go public with her good fortune . We are publishing her story in the hope it may give rise to more experimentation and a better life for IBD sufferers . <p> When I was 24 , doctors told me I had cancer . <p> I had just returned from my first trip overseas . I was four years into a promising career as a newspaper reporter . My future seemed bright . Then the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It turned out that the doctors were wrong . The suspected cancerous tumor was a harmless polyp in my colon  --  a sign of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) rather than a fatal illness . Had I understood the nature of my reprieve , I might have preferred a cancer that could have been easily excised by a surgeon 's scalpel and better understood by my family and friends . <p> Doctors told me I had Crohn 's disease , one of the many recurring , debilitating sicknesses loosely labeled as chronic illnesses . That catchall phrase includes maladies as diverse as epilepsy , diabetes , and chronic fatigue syndrome . <p> There are no exact figures as to how many people are chronically ill in the United States . The National Health Council , a nonprofit association of national health organizations based in Washington , D.C. , estimates that there are 49 million Americans who suffer ' both disabilities and chronic illnesses . Although the symptoms vary , there is a numbing sameness to the way in which chronic illnesses and disabilities take a mental and physical toll on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle is a story fraught with miracles both large and small . Earlier this year , I persuaded my doctor to try an experimental course of treatment , Within two weeks , the medicine alleviated symptoms that stubbornly had resisted standard treatments for years . If my " fix " proves true , it could signal hope for some of the two million people now diagnosed with Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis . <p> I also have experienced less dramatic miracles  --  the subtle and profound changes that everyone who faces any kind of chronic disease can discover . By limiting my outer life , illness provided me with an inner peace , strength , and wisdom that came after years of struggling with denial , anger , isolation , and self-doubts . <p> Only now , when I am on the winning side of good health , do I fully appreciate the gray areas of disease that medicine can not reach and our society does not understand . <p> Our knowledge of medicine revolves around a few key illnesses . Cancer usually can be treated by chemotherapy , radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and AIDS also carry definitive death sentences . The limits of medical treatment in such cases are clear-cut , and the patient 's suffering merits social acknowledgment and compassion . <p> By comparison , chronic illnesses fall through the cracks between good health and certain death . Although doctors and their patients recognize the physical causes of illness , it is often hard for them to take that knowledge to heart . Doctors used to curing patients , or having them die , are frustrated by the intractability of incurable , but nonfatal , diseases . Patients are worn down by debilitating symptoms and limited understanding . <p> Take chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) . Its vague name reveals just how little doctors know about this illness that renders its victims weak for many years . Its nickname , the " yuppie disease , " points up the social stigma often attached to chronic illnesses . Some misunderstood diseases and their sufferers wait years for full medical recognition and social acceptability . <p> Psychiatrists , who initially studied Crohn 's disease , believed that patients had negative personality traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsive behavior and their inability to express anger . Only later did doctors realize that they had confused cause and effect . Studies showed that most patients suffered mental anguish only after Crohn 's disease had weakened their bodies and limited their lives . <p> Unfortunately , many patients suffering with chronic illness internalize psychological tags and outside criticism because we live in a society where good health is the norm . Despite reassurances from my doctors , I initially wanted to believe that stress caused my symptoms . Unfortunately , I found a psychologist who was willing to feed this fantasy of a painless cure . <p> Quack healers are as dangerous as the other extreme  --  doctors who deny the relationship between mind and body . Sickness has taught me the subtlety of that complex interaction . I do not believe that yoga and prayer cure Crohn 's disease , but I know that both helped me feel better . Deep breathing and mental exercises went a long way toward helping me to diffuse the excruciating pain caused by days of colon cramping . On nights when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer brought a peace that only came when I felt completely helpless . <p> Despite exciting advances , doctors still have a poor understanding of Crohn 's and many other chronic illnesses . Researchers rarely know the causes of these diseases . As a result , they have no cures to offer . The most plausible theory for many of these illnesses is that they result from breakdowns in the body 's immune system . In healthy people , the immune system fights infections and then shuts off when the battle is won . But in autoimmune diseases , the system never stops . Instead , it begins attacking healthy tissue . <p> In Crohn 's and other inflammatory bowel diseases , this war often takes place in the intestines . The results are bleeding ulcers that prompt the body to release an oozing phlegm of antibodies . The blood and phlegm mix with other wastes to form diarrhea that the colon evacuates with painful cramping . Because of the ongoing infection , patients have recurring low-grade fevers and difficulty absorbing essential nutrients normally processed by the intestines . <p> Inflammatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bowels they attack , and the efficacy of surgery as a treatment , among other things . The mildest form of disease is proctitis  --  an inflammation of the lower colon near the rectum . The worst form is Crohn 's disease , which normally attacks large sections of the bowel and , unlike colitis and proctitis , can not be cured by surgically removing damaged tissue . <p> My case was perplexing because I had symptoms of both proctitis and Crohn 's disease . My problems were always limited to the lower eight inches of my colon . That made it easy for doctors to dismiss my ailments as proctitis . Biopsies also supported that diagnosis . As the years wore on , my symptoms worsened . I did not respond well to the traditional medicines  --  sulfa drugs and steroids . I kept getting sicker , spending months in bed , unable to eat solid food or to work . I ran fevers for months on end and was so weak that I had to give up my favorite activities of swimming and hiking . Even simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved difficult . Still , doctors kept insisting that I had only a mild illness . <p> I now realize that impressive-sounding diagnoses can be the signposts of medical ignorance . Diagnoses are a lot like bulky cloaks . They provide a certain degree of warmth , but they convey only the vaguest sense of what lies underneath . <p> As a friend of mine struggling with the dilemma of whether to put her mother in a nursing home said , " The doctors say she has osteoporosis . What does that really mean ? It says nothing about her problems or how she and I cope with everyday life . It 's just an empty word . " Perhaps the British have a more appropriate label : they call osteoporosis " skeletal failure . " <p> Because mine was never a classic textbook case , it took doctors eight frustrating years to decide I had some form of Crohn 's disease . The search for a proper diagnosis showed the degree to which medical identifications carry their own logic . Once doctors decided I had proctitis , they continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailments . <p> I understand why both doctors and their patients latch onto impressive scientific tags . It stems from the hope that once doctors classify and name symptoms , they can then deliver a cure . I often indulged in this kind of fantastic thinking . I believed when doctors finally figured out what to call my ailments , I would magically find myself on the path to wellness . <p> During my initial dealings with doctors , I trusted their wisdom . When my first physician wrongly diagnosed me with cancer , I dismissed his error as a mistake of inexperienced earnestness . When doctors could not diagnose my problems , I dismissed their failure , believing in the complexities of my own case . <p> It took five years for my faith to falter . I had left my job and entered a demanding Ph.D . program . Like many patients with chronic illnesses , I was unable to get adequate medical insurance after I moved . As my bills mounted , a local doctor agreed to treat me at reduced rates . I did not realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill and he opted to handle my case by phone . My weight dropped more than 30 pounds in three weeks , my fever never dropped below 102 degrees , and I bled constantly . <p> Through his nurse , the doctor continued to assure me that I was not that sick , even though I could only eat crushed ice , juice , and broth . One morning at 5:00 a.m. , I awoke in agony , went to the toilet , and felt a huge release and a long gush of blood . As my doctor examined me , he gasped , then said , " I 've never seen anything that looked this bad in the 12 years I 've been in practice . " From that moment , I realized that doctors are limited , and I had to become the most ardent advocate for my own health . <p> I wrote pharmaceutical companies to learn about new medicines that might work for me . I read books explaining nutrition and symptoms . Most important , I gleaned new hope by learning how other patients had triumphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed bleak . I was sick all the time but had no medical insurance . I was too weak to simultaneously hold a job and research my dissertation . It took all of my energy to spend eight hours every day in libraries and archives . My savings and grants were running low . Friends offered to provide free housing , and I moved to Houston to write my dissertation . <p> There , I finally found a skilled gastroenterologist , Dr. Philip Bentlif , who appreciated the ambiguity of my case . The fact that my illness did.not fit traditional labels did not bother Dr. Bentlif . He said I had Crohn 's colitis and began treating my symptoms . I was relieved to find a doctor who heeded my voice , and I slowly began to improve . <p> After a year , I took a job in the mountains of North Carolina . My illness had fallen into a tiresome and depressing pattern . I was never quite sick and never quite well . I had exhausted the traditional medicines , and the only ones that still seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down the body 's protective system . Immuno-suppressives pose a high-risk solution because they leave patients open to other infections . <p> Last fall , I read about the work of Dr. Barry Marshall , who was then an associate professor of medicine at the University of Virginia . For ten years , Marshall battled to win recognition for his theory that a bacterium , Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori for short ) caused peptic ulcers . <p> Marshall 's theory challenged entrenched medical wisdom . Traditional approaches called for treating ulcer symptoms with long and expensive courses of medicine . By contrast , Marshall 's treatment consisted of a two-week course of antibiotics to kill off the H. pylori , which then eliminated the symptoms . <p> A magazine profile of how Marshall reached his conclusions struck a chord with me . H. pylori is commonly found in poorer nations ; I had first contracted my illness after a bout of dysentery in India . H. pylori reacted well to antibiotics ; the only drug that had ever worked well for me was a powerful antibiotic , metronidazole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local internist . Robert Griffith is an unusual doctor ; he came to medicine later in life and chose to settle in my small town , rather than pursue a more lucrative practice in a larger city . During his residency , Griffith had studied with Marshall at the University of Virginia . He expressed skepticism that a cure for stomach ulcers could provide any relief for colon complaints . Still , he was open-minded enough to call Marshall and discuss my case . Neither believed it would help , but neither thought it would hurt . <p> Testing for H. pylori is an arduous process long distance , and I already had begun taking Marshall 's recommended cure for ulcers by the time my test results came back negative . That cross in communication proved to be a blessing . Although I did not have H. pylori , the broad spectrum antibiotic , Biaxin , had worked . After years of continuous bleeding , cramping , diarrhea , and fevers , I was suddenly free of symptoms . <p> Initially , I did not tell anyone what had happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was little more than proof of the placebo effect that occurs when patients succumb to the power of suggestion . I superstitiously feared that telling my story would jinx my good health , prompting another relapse . Furthermore , I did not want to publicize my experience and give other Crohn 's sufferers false hope . Now that eight months have passed , I believe my long battle with chronic illness has ended . <p> I called Barry Marshall , who has left the University of Virginia to set up the International Research Foundation for Helicobacter Pylori and Intestinal Immunology in Charlottesville , Virginia . Marshall knew of only one case besides mine in which his course of antibiotic treatment cured inflammatory bowel disease . Currently , there is no way to keep track of such cases  --  a problem Marshall hopes to correct with his foundation . <p> My case did not surprise Dr. Marshall . If his theories are correct , then the body hosts many bacteria in the colon besides the ones that researchers have isolated . Once doctors identify some of these disease agents , Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , inflammatory bowel diseases . <p> Marshall cites the encouraging work of his colleague , Dr. Thomas Borody of Sydney , Australia , who has been experimenting with bacterial transplants . Dr. Borody 's treatment consists of cleansing diseased bowels of all bacteria , then transplanting new bacteria from a healthy person . Like the antibiotics I was on , this method provides a broad-brush way of helping patients until doctors can target individual disease-causing bacteria . <p> The search to find those bacteria will consist of sophisticated detective work . When the body senses a foreign substance , the immune system , acting through lymphocyte cells , creates a tailor-made antibody . As Marshall explains , " Within molecular biology , we are developing various high-tech ways of looking at antibodies ; conceivably , we will be able to remove a lymphocyte and work out its DNA to see what it is directed toward . Ultimately , we 'll be able to identify new bacteria . " <p> Dr. Marshall provided the scientific explanation , but that provided few insights on how to adjust to my new-found health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . After eight months , I still find myself behaving as if I am sick . Recently , I went to visit new neighbors who live a mile down my road . I reached for my car keys , then realized I could walk . When I take a trip , I have to remind myself to pack only one set of clothes ; I no longer have to take extra pants and skirts in case of accidents . I now face the glorious prospect of integrating my new insights as I try to pick up where I left off 13 years ago . <p> Last month , a friend of a friend told me about her battle with chronic fatigue syndrome . Hers was a chilling tale of loneliness and frustration . Her husband urged her to keep her illness secret so it would not affect his chances of climbing up the corporate ladder . Her friends had stopped calling because she could not spend enough time with them . To my own surprise , I found myself saying that having a chronic illness had been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I wondered what had prompted me to think of sickness as a benefit . By nature , I am impatient , stubborn , ambitious , and a workaholic . Obviously , illness has not changed my basic character . But it did force me to become more patient , to appreciate the smaller joys in life , and to pay more attention to my body and surroundings . Because I have " lost " so many years , I now see time , ambition , and work differently . I have become more spiritual and more sympathetic to other peoples ' weaknesses and failings . <p> I was lucky . I found good doctors who kept me going without the drastic step of surgically removing my colon . I had supportive relatives and friends who tried to understand my frustration and fears . With their help , I never lost hope  --  which is ultimately any patient 's best tool to combat chronic illness . <p> PHOTO : Dr. Mary Stolberg , as she appeared at her gradation for her Ph.D . degree .
