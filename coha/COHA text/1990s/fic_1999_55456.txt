I HAVE COME MORE AND MORE TO BELIEVE in the validity of first impressions . All or almost all of the personalities involved is contained in that first instant , I think , though we do n't always bother to read the entire message . Once a man came to pick me up for dinner , a blind date . My door at that time was glass , and I could see that he was handsome , vain , self-absorbed , and mean , and that he did not like me . All quite correct , but nevertheless we " fell in love " that same night ( I am not sure that we ever liked each other ) and lived together for longer than I care to admit . <p> However , there were three great occasions of my meeting people whom I loved and liked on sight , and in all three cases I still do , very much . Conveniently , these meetings took place at ten-year intervals : Judith , in 1938 ; Billy , in ' 48 ; and Max , ' 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1951 , and I loved/liked/was crazy about him on sight , and I still am , but that is a whole other story . ) <p> I first watched Judith walk past my parents ' house in North Carolina , on the red-clay road out front . I was inside on the window-seat , not doing much . I could see that she was about my age , and that she was clearly from somewhere else , was not southern . I liked her on sight . Her clothes were non-southern : a camelhair polo coat , and she wore two long blond braids , with bangs across her forehead . Even her walk was different , was Yankee : she strode , in a strong , emphatic way ( she still does , despite a recent hip replacement ) . I wanted to know her , to talk and be friends , maybe to go on walks in the woods , or bike rides through town and out in the country together , if she had a bike . <p> The next day she rode past my house on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big balloon tires , the current favorite model from Sears . Knowing the road , I knew she would very likely come back the same way ; I got out my own bike and waited , carefully posing as an accidental presence . She did come back , and we exclaimed at the coincidence of bikes , and I pointed up at my house . " That 's where I live , " I told her . <p> She said , " God , what a wonderful house ! " I was pleased , of course ; I had never seen our house as in any way " wonderful , " just big-too big for only three people , as was often remarked . She added , " I think I 've seen you there . " <p> So she had been aware of me , too ? <p> Her accent was very " northern " ; I had been right about that . And nice southern girls , the only kind I knew , did not say " God " in that way . <p> I told her I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did , and we headed off down the highway , somewhere along the line exchanging names . Becoming friends . She and her parents had moved down from Wisconsin , via Connecticut . ( Wisconsin was " north " to me ; I had never heard of the Midwest . ) We both liked to read , it soon came out , and  --  wonderfully !  --  many of the same books : the same odd mix of children 's and " grownup " books . We had both read and liked The Grapes of Wrath , we loved Thomas Wolfe , and we quoted : "  --  lost , and by the wind grieved , ghost  --  . " We liked the novels of E. Nesbit , and of Arthur Ransome . Our favorite movie was Lost Horizons . Judith planned to go to Tibet someday , but what with one thing and another ( five children , plus some of the care of her sister 's four ) , she has not . I confided that I wrote poetry , that I wanted to become a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's wonderful , " said Judith , in her serious , emphatic voice . <p> Chapel Hill in those days was an extremely small town , and so it is not surprising that our parents soon met , and they too became friends . Drinking pals , though possibly they drank no more than everyone else of their age , middle age , at that time . My parents , Virginians , were southern snobs to the core ; they were snobbish toward the whole state of North Carolina , where they lived for many , many years . They spoke snobbishly of Judith 's parents , their accents and social habits , but they continued to see each other a lot . I liked Judith 's parents and their somewhat loud forthrightness . Also , Judith 's mother was very interested in how things looked , and in clothes , which mine was not . She was extremely proud and fond of Judith , and she liked me too . <p> It is hard to account for that persistent snobbery , and even harder to explain my own negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who talked like that , with that accent , was stupid and ignorant , and unkind and unfair to Negroes  --  an odd view for a child who had spent little time anywhere else , just isolated summers in Maine . I disliked southern girls especially , and generally did not feel liked by them . I sensed disapproval . I much preferred Yankees , especially Judith . <p> We spent a lot of time together . We rode our bikes all over town  --  in those days not a dangerous pastime ; we often stopped at the ice-cream parlor for small sundaes , chocolate or butterscotch , a nickel each . We walked for miles and miles in the thick and beautiful woods that surrounded the town ; in every weather we hiked down to the creek and over to the waterfall and past the sturdy grapevine swing  --  but I remember best the glorious falls , seasons of brilliant scarlet and golden and yellow leaves , and the brightest , most electric-blue skies . And in spring , when the stream that fed the creek below the waterfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafed out in green , with small white flowers  --  so sweet to suck on their stems . <p> In adolescence , high school , Judith and I stayed friends , but there were changes . Alterations . There were boys , in whom we had , both of us , the most passionate interest . Sometimes we were rivals , though never for the same boy at the same time ; I think some code or perhaps just natural caution prevented any boy from a gesture toward the two of us simultaneously . But each of us was highly aware of how big a " rush " the other got at a dance , meaning the number of times we were cut in on by other boys while dancing . It was best of all if the boys chose to argue about it  --  to fight over you , as it were . <p> More usually we were confederates , confidantes . We said mean things to each other about the sweet surround of southern girls , Mary Elizabeth and Betty Sue and Sally and Kitty and Snubbie , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures . I told Judith that Jim and I had kissed about five times ( exactly five times , God knows I had guiltily counted ) ; I felt much better when she admitted that she and Robert had kissed at least that often , possibly more . <p> We measured ourselves , and found that Judith 's waist was a half-inch smaller than mine ; on the other hand , I had fuller breasts . One afternoon we somehow got into the principal 's office , into the files , and we found that my IQ was higher , but neither of us put much stock in IQ tests . <p> But mostly we made each other laugh ; we had great fun together-and I now see that this is true of all three first-sight people I 'm writing about , very much including my son , whom I still find really funny . <p> After those close early years with Judith came various separations ; her parents moved to New York , to a smart apartment in the East Forties where I visited several times . ( We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Madison , Wisconsin , for a year ; I loved it there but then was sent to a hateful boarding school in Virginia : many southern girls , no boys , and terrifying teachers . Judith went to college in New Orleans , and I went up to Radcliffe . <p> We both married relatively young , I younger than Judith-a man I 'd met at Harvard , which did not work out . Judith , by then in San Francisco , married a reporter on the Chronicle ( Tim Adams , no relation to me , but she became Judith Adams ) ; he was great , crazy about her , as she was of him , for good , and they had five children . But all this is to get far ahead . <p> My next sighting of an instantly loved/liked person took place in Palo Alto , California , in the late ' 40s . In the meantime I had lived for a year with my husband in Paris , where he studied at the Sorbonne on the GI Bill and I tried , unsuccessfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he would work on a graduate degree ( more GI Bill ) and I would get some sort of supportive job , which was standard practice at the time : young men in grad school with working wives who would also type their papers and iron their shirts ( not my favorite period ) . <p> One afternoon we went to a party for the Writing Fellows at the local creative writing department  --  and there was Billy , one of the Fellows : a small , very lively , bright-blue-eyed man , instantly amusing and amused , with a great deep laugh . You felt right away with Billy that you were the most attractive person he had ever met . I felt  --  we all three felt  --  an immediate rapport . <p> A sense of being at odds with our present surroundings was an initial unifying emotion . There we were , in this big , new California house , with its two-story view of rolling green hills spread with live oaks , and with two-story bookcases ( Henry James , whom Wally , the host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf , I noted , and pointed out to Billy  --  who laughed ) . All the other guests looked " Californian , " especially the men , all so tall and large , mostly blond , in white T-shirts and jeans . As I said , Billy was small , somewhat birdlike , and my husband is of an average size , as I am , I guess . There was a Russian man there , Boris , later to work in the CIA , who walked past our trio several times and muttered , " Just what do you three people have in common ? " as we laughed , considering outrageous answers to his question . <p> Billy had a wonderful voice , deep and resonant , and his laugh was marvelously responsive . He was extremely funny , and he made you feel that you were too . That day , at that graceless party ( few introductions made , scant bad food , and cheap wine ) , I felt myself to be a charming and gifted woman , not a nutty girl in her early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any job . Who secretly did not much like her husband . <p> Billy 's accent was purest Harvard , which even then awakened nostalgic feelings in us , the brand-new Californians . In fact , all that year , so lightened and brightened by the presence of Billy , Harvard was the standard by which we judged California and Californians . " Faute de mieux friends , " was Billy 's term for the people we knew out there , people with whom , according to him , I tended to become overinvolved ( " But how can you care what Nancy thinks ? Or for that matter , Les ? " ) . That first afternoon we shared a great deal of Cambridge gossip , and we laughed , as we were to laugh all year . And actually I liked many of the people out there much more than ! would have confessed to Billy ; I liked Carolyn and Herb from Kansas , and Shirley and Christy from Nebraska , and Jean and Jim from Arizona . But Billy probably knew . <p> Recently someone said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at a time when that was hardly popular . At which he laughed and said , " But did I have a choice ? " One can see what he means ; it is hard to imagine Billy in the macho pose that most of those Fellows adopted . The overriding message of that place seemed to be , " We 're writers , but we 're not queer , God knows we 're not . " <p> There was even an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle in which one of the directors said , " There are very few beards around here . " ( Beard was at that time a code word for homosexuality . ) " In fact most of us are married . " There was considerable talk of the " effeminate East , " and I once got into a somewhat drunken argument with Wally , the head of it all , as to who was the better writer , Jack London or Henry James . Small , truly gay , James-loving Billy was more than a breath of fresh air ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found all that western-macho stuff suspect , and we occupied ourselves in a minute observation of the behavior of its practitioners , especially when everyone was drunk ; then , we thought , their " true natures " might emerge . And in a way we were rewarded : I remember a " happily married " man , beardless , who seemed to have a crush on my husband . As he put it , " None of this fairy stuff . I just really like you , " while heavily attempting an embrace . For us , rich fodder indeed . <p> Most of those parties were , finally , pretty drunken . No one had much money ; it was usually BYOB , and people wanted to finish the bottles they had brought . For me the main point was the telephone conversation with Billy the next day , from my office in the purchasing department , where I had at last got a job . Incredibly boring work , but not demanding ; it was easy to spend a lot of time on the phone , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those parties , and he led me to believe that I did too  --  though I am sure he was better at it . But that was a major skill of Billy 's ; he created you for yourself , as you would like to be  --  highly civilized , amusing , and talented , perhaps rather like himself . To put it simply , he made you like yourself better , and what could be a higher capacity in a friend ? Billy was exactly what I needed ; my self-esteem had hit new lows , what with being broke and unpublished and badly married . <p> We did have a topic other than local or Harvard gossip : books . Billy was a passionate reader with a marvelous memory , especially for poetry , his truest love . I had studied with some of Billy 's old professors ; we had , in a sense , the same education , though his seemed superior . But we could talk about Robert Hillyer , whom Billy had known well and liked ; and silly , handsome Theodore Spencer ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I had , more than anyone I knew at that time , and he tried to correct the gaps in my reading . " You have n't read Elizabeth Bowen ? But you 'll adore her , so incredibly beautiful , your kind of writer . " ( You see ? even the instruction was flattering . ) He was right about Bowen ; I loved her on sight . And , " You 've really never read Proust ? Oh , how I envy you ! A first reading , and you 're just the right age  --  so young . Start tomorrow . " I did , and loved it . Reading Proust was rather like talking to Billy : Swann and Mme. de Guermantes , the Verdurins and Charlus , were now included in our conversation . <p> At some point  --  I am , mercifully , a little vague about this  --  I had of course told Billy about my own wish to write , and I showed him something I was working on . I have no idea what it was  --  perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a title Billy would have appreciated , I think . He was very kind , and most intelligently constructive , and from then on he talked and behaved as though I were a writer , which was even more profoundly helpful than the most constructive criticism was . When I say that Billy saved my sanity , I am serious . I was involved in a damaging marriage , from which I saw no way out . <p> Billy 's emotional life was difficult too . He was strongly drawn to a series of young men who were in no sense gay , who were not even especially bright or interesting ; they liked him well enough , often were quite charmed , but they certainly did not return his affection in kind  --  and it was always important that they not " know . " I had a similar problem , a string of crushes on young men of our graduate-student circle , men who , married or single , did not want the responsibility of an affair with a nutty married woman who wanted to write . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips out for ice or more booze  --  not exactly satisfactory , and hardly romantic . Billy and I discussed all this with extreme discretion , and indirection , but I think we were a comfort to each other ( he was to me , I know ) . <p> A high point for both of us was Katherine Anne Porter 's visit to the writing center . She had been invited to teach there , but when the authorities learned that she lacked any university degrees , it was ruled that no one taking her courses would receive academic credit . Highly annoyed , Miss Porter , on her first day there , made the following speech ( I 'm pretty sure I still have it right ) : " If any of you are even remotely serious about becoming writers , you must leave this place at once . For no good writing ever goes on in or around a so-called Creative Writing Center . " All this in her very beautiful voice  --  as her white hair and very dark eyes and her immaculate pastel clothes were beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , to put it mildly , with the heads of that department , Wally and Dick , both of them ( especially Wally ) writers of some reputation  --  a fact that Miss Porter never in any way acknowledged . Also , she rented a small cabin in Woodside ( " The woods are so lovely out there , and the smells , " she was heard to say ) some miles from the campus and inaccessible in bad weather . Since she did not drive , she was wholly dependent on student volunteers ; what with one thing and another , she did not exactly show up every day . <p> She and Billy became good friends . He wrote a lovely poem about her . She said , " Oh , how beautiful ; no one has ever written a poem for me before "  --  very likely an untruth , but such a nice one . The poem was published in Harper 's . <p> A couple of Billy 's early novels had appeared by then and been well reviewed ; he was hailed as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was especially fond . And he was working that year on a long new novel , for which Margot , his agent , had high hopes . Things looked good for him . <p> We celebrated Billy 's thirtieth birthday in his small Menlo Park apartment . It seemed sad that he had become so old , but we drank martinis and played Noel Coward records ; we made a festive occasion . <p> By chance , I was with Billy at the moment when , literarily , things changed drastically for him . We had gone to the campus post office together , where Billy picked up his mail . He found a letter from his publisher , who wrote that , alas , he did not see his way to publishing Billy 's new novel , which he so hoped would not be Billy 's last . With warmest personal regards . <p> " Oh , " said Billy . " Well , this is not exactly what I expected . Somewhat disappointing , in fact . " <p> That book was eventually published by someone else , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy 's vision of himself as a successful novelist began to dissipate . After a depressing period of floundering , he took up editorial work in Boston  --  work in which he has been and still is a great success , for which he seems admirably suited . He also took up life with a somewhat younger man , a distinguished scholar , with whom he has traveled and written books and established what has every look of a happy life . <p> By 1958 my son was seven , and it was increasingly clear to me that his father and I were making each other very unhappy . But we had no money , and I did not see how I could leave . Still an unpublished writer , I was not a good job prospect . However , I decided to go back " home , " to North Carolina , for that summer . ( My mother had died the year before Peter was born , and my father quickly married a longtime lady friend . ) My father and stepmother would go to my mother 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stay in the Chapel Hill house  --  and the pool !  --  while they were away . Naturally , things were not that simple : the house was rented , but I could have " the apartment "  --  a wing of the house  --  and use of the pool and of my father 's old car , in which I would drive to Maine with Peter in August . So Peter and I flew to North Carolina , and after only a few bad drunken family fights , my father and stepmother took off for Maine . And everything in my life improved , astoundingly . <p> One of the pleasures of that all-around amazing summer was that of knowing a woman who lived across the road from my father ( the road where twenty years back I had first seen Judith ) . Lucie was a person of enormous intelligence and vast charm . A psychoanalyst , she often swam with Peter and me after her last patient , and one afternoon she said , in her beautifully accented voice , " Alice , my friend Max writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach , with some friends . A place called Windy Hill , in South Carolina , where he is from , I believe . I wondered , would you and Peter  --  ? " <p> I had heard of Max , had read his novel and a lot of short stories . He was marvelous , I thought , an extraordinary writer . Of course , I said yes . <p> Even the drive to Windy Hill was beautiful and exciting ; I remember a wild sense of freedom and release . As we neared the coast , there were mysterious swamps , dead trees and stumps hung with Spanish moss . Then dunes , and the little town . We followed directions , parked the car at an unremarkable house . We got out , and I looked up  --  at Max . Tall Max , with pale , wide , wise blue eyes , a high forehead , high cheekbones , and a small , witty mouth  --  about to laugh . <p> I loved him on sight . I really did , and I knew that ( probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both laughed . It was so funny , standing there in the bright beach sunlight , and laughing . In love . <p> And that is how we spent the rest of the summer , really . Much laughing . Much love . ( " We 're oversexed and overprivileged , " Max once said . ) <p> The other guests were a just-divorced young man with his infant son , and a youngish French girl , whom I guessed to be with Max ; what is odd , given my sometimes jealous nature , is how I paid next to no attention to that connection . Lucie and I discussed that relationship on the drive home . Lucie said , " She is very nice , but I think Max may require a more difficult , more demanding woman . " I agreed , silently adding , Yes . Me . <p> Windy Hill itself was  --  perfect . An endless , broad , silk-smooth sandy white beach , and gentle Atlantic waves . ( I was used to coarse gray sand and the rough , unreliable Pacific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , lively sand crabs and lovely shells . ( He still remembers those shells , he says ) . He had just learned to swim , so we went into the mild surf together , got out and walked down the beach , and came back to talk to Max . Max and Peter got on well from the start . Max thought Peter was extraordinary , a most wonderful and amazing boy ( he was right ) , and Peter thought Max was funny . <p> Max and I seemed to know a lot of people in common  --  not just Chapel Hill people , but all sorts , from everywhere . From both our lives . And this seemed a sort of omen . <p> If I could relive any four or five days in my life , I might choose those , and not because I want to change a thing ; I do n't  --  they were perfect , Or why not relive the whole summer , while I 'm at it ? <p> After Windy Hill , when Peter and I were back in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max to call  --  and he did , inviting me to a party . I got a sitter for Peter easily enough . I wore my best and barest palegreen summer dress . A deep tan was thought desirable , then , and I was still brown from the beach and from days spent at the pool . I was thin , confident , and optimistic . <p> The party was a sort of dance . Records were played , mostly slow , romantic songs , befitting a hot southern summer night . And Max and I danced slowly , romantically , out on someone 's darkened porch . <p> The next day Max came over  --  several times ; he kept coming and going . He said , " I ca n't believe this is happening to me . I have to keep leaving and coming back to check . " Which was as explicit a conversation about what was happening between us as we ever had . It is odd , given our both being writers ; as anyone who has ever been involved with a writer knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tatters . But we did not ; we absolutely did not . We almost never used the dangerous " L " word , just acted it out . No discussion or analysis of feelings , no plans or promises regarding the future . <p> It is odd , too , given my tendency to excess worry , to anxiety and hyper-careful plans , that when I had reasonable cause to worry about my future , I did not . I did not think in a practical way about a divorce , and supporting myself and Peter . I just glided through the summer , happily sure that things would work out . " It 's going to take you a while to get used to being happy , " Max once said  --  so wisely , we both thought at the time . <p> Judith , then living in Washington , DC , came down to see me for a few days . As we sat by the pool , improving our tans , I told her I meant to get a divorce , and without much comment she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you once you 've told him . " She was thinking more clearly than I was . She and Max met , and they liked each other a lot . Once Judith more or less understood our situation , she suggested that I spend a night with Max while she was there , in case Peter woke in the night . I asked Max , and he said , in his courtly South Carolina way , " I certainly think we should take advantage of her offer . " Good , practical , generous Judith  --  and good Peter , who did not wake until I was back for breakfast . <p> During her visit , Judith and I took some great long walks to places we had walked before , twenty years back . <p> I was working on a novel that summer , but it was so hot . And I was distracted . One day I wrote , " Waves of longing came over her like waves . " And on another , just one sentence : " Nobody had mentioned Herbert . " Max thought they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you a lot about Herbert , right off , " he said . We laughed and laughed , which tells you something about the level of our humor . <p> In the afternoons Peter went to a day camp , and Max and I sometimes drank beer in a curious place called the Tonga Room , a dark basement bar that was very cool and quiet . Or sometimes we just went to his apartment . At night I often made supper for the three of us , or I got sitters and went off to local parties , sometimes with Max , occasionally with Lucie . At those parties I had a pleased new sense of being liked and approved of , even , by those people I had known all my life . Why , she 's nice  --  I could feel them thinking that . As a child and then a very young woman I had not exactly been known as bad , but I had been thought rebellious ( God knows I was ) and difficult : going up to Radcliffe , instead of Sweet Briar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were distressed or offended by what they sensed of my relationship with Max , they were too polite to show it , or possibly I was too happy to notice . <p> Everything we did that summer was punctuated by dips in the pool , which , down in a ravine below the house , somehow remained cool . At night it seemed especially delicious , that dark , cool water on our bare skins . We also went for walks at night , on those white country roads of the neighborhood , among fireflies and flowering weeds . Max told Peter terrible jokes , or riddles , like " Would you rather be run over by an old Greyhound bus , or a new one ? " Which Max thought was funnier than Peter did , but Peter was and is extremely polite . <p> And then , inevitably , it was time for Peter and me to drive to Maine , and Max and I still had no plan about what would happen to us . Our future . The night before we were to leave , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoken rules ; I made various romantic , dramatic declarations , but Max forgave me , I think . <p> Once , many years later , Max and I were talking about how slow to catch on we both are ; he was talking about his marriage , I about a too-long live-in love affair . " It 's good we never got married , " one of us said , and the other agreed , " Yes , we still would be . " And I can not remember which of us said which . We had the great good sense to stay close friends , is what I think . <p> A couple of years ago Judith 's youngest son , an actor , got married in Santa Monica , and I went down for the wedding . ( Her husband , Tim , had died a few years back . ) And there was Judith , surrounded by her five children , their husbands and wives , and a bunch of grandchildren . Judith had organized us all into a small seaside motel , so we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one another , but they all get on , for the most part , and I like them all immensely . The wedding was splendid , and the mother of the groom looked especially splendid  --  gray-blond , beaming , and beautiful . <p> Billy has lived out here for many years , in Hillsborough , just south of San Francisco . We talk on the phone often , see each other when we can . There have been certain problems ( " issues " ) , though , regarding each other 's pets . He does n't like cats ( I have two ) , and he thinks I do not like dogs ; actually it is only his dog , Chincos , that I do n't like . Billy has , however , taken a great fancy to my big Maine coon cat , Sam , which he has resolved by insisting that Sam is a dog in a cat suit . <p> Billy and I plan an elegant celebration next fall , when we will have known each other  --  dare I say it ?  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Boris 's " What do you people have in common ? " Well , quite a lot , apparently . <p> And  --  Max . A couple of months ago I went back to Chapel Hill , ostensibly for a southern writers ' conference but really just to see the town , and Max . He gave a reading at the conference , and I am not the only person who thought it was by far the best event : a brilliant short story , marvelously read . And the old town was at its most beautiful  --  everywhere , white dogwood delicately spreading its branches . Max and I took our customary walk through the cemetery ( " We know more people here than on Main Street , right ? Look at that tacky stone  --  the Crowders , of course " ) . <p> We went out to dinner with his former wife ( another person I like immensely ) , and at the end she said , " That was nice , but let 's not get married again , OK ? " And then to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying , " I hope it was n't too romantic for you ? " The next morning Max came and took me to an early plane for Mexico City , where I was to meet Peter and then go on to Oaxaca . I urged Max to come see me in San Francisco , and he said that maybe he would move out there . ( But I do n't believe that he will . ) <p> <p> By Alice Adams <p>
