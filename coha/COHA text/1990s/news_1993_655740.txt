<p> WHEN Russian and German dignitaries gathered at the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg last fall for an exhibition , their attention was focused not on the masterpieces crowding the walls , but on an old man in military attire . <p> For ex-Red Army officer Victor Baldin , the show of drawings from Bremen , Germany was a personal victory in a long , and at times apparently hopeless , struggle . The story of Mr. Baldin 's collection of works by such artists as Rembrandt , Rubens , Goya , Durer , Monet , and Van Gogh is a fascinating glimpse into Soviet concealment of art treasures plundered from occupied territory in World War II . <p> In fact , Baldin is only one of many former Soviet officers who looted more than 2-1/2 million works of art from Nazi Germany . <p> Baldin 's tale , and that of the Bremen collection , is only one page out of a secret history that has just begun to be told in the last two years . <p> Baldin was a young Soviet army officer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Red Army comrades carried the Bremen collection back home as a trophy of war . He spent much of the rest of his life trying to return the 360 drawings and two paintings to their rightful owners . <p> At the end of the war , Soviet authorities justified the looting of German museums , considering the action compensation for the Nazi destruction of the churches of Pskov and Novgorod , the czarist palaces on the outskirts of St. Petersburg , and the removal of thousands of artworks from museums in Nazi-occupied territories . <p> In the first years after the war , Soviet museum officials termed the seized art treasures legal trophies of war and even prepared expositions of the famous German collections . But with the cold war and the partition of Germany , information about the art became a state secret . The works were hidden in secret depositories created in many Soviet museums . <p> Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev returned some of the art as part of a policy of support for East Germany . In 1956 the collection of the Dresden gallery was returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent back as a " gesture of good will " aimed at securing East German support for the Soviet invasion of Hungary . <p> But even after this , about half a million art works belonging to West German museums , private collections , and the museums of other European countries remained in Soviet hands . Among them was the legendary Trojan gold treasure excavated by Heinrich Schliemann , as well as paintings by Durer , El Greco , Goya , Daumier , Monet , Renoir , Degas , Cezanne , and Van Gogh . <p> Though rumors swirled for years about the existence of these treasures , their secret was not exposed until the writers revealed their existence in an April 1991 article in the American ARTnews magazine . <p> By the end of that autumn , under pressure from journalists , diplomats , and art historians , the Soviet Ministry of Culture finally admitted the existence of the special depositories . But the powerful ministry continued to insist that the artworks were just compensation for destroyed Soviet treasures . <p> In the summer of 1992 , after the disintegration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special decree establishing a State Commission on Restitution . But the process of return is slow , and Germany , the Netherlands , and other countries are still awaiting the return of their lost works . <p> Moreover , the repatriation of these masterpieces is complicated by the fact that many were not removed by the special brigades sent into occupied Berlin , but were looted by individual Soviet generals , officers , and soldiers . Thousands of valuable artworks still remain in private hands . <p> The twisted tale of the Bremen Kunsthalle collection more than illustrates the fate of many pieces of so-called trophy art . <p> On May 5 , 1945 , the 38th Field Engineer Brigade of the Soviet Red Army was ordered to move to the town of Kiritz , about 40 miles north of Berlin . Looking for a place to set up camp , Baldin , a young brigade officer , came upon the castle of Kranzow , a picturesque building on a lakeshore , surrounded by a forest . After evicting its occupants , Count Konigsmark and his family , the brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other young officers and soldiers , lived in a tent in the forest . <p> On the morning of July 30 , the brigade received orders to leave Kiritz . The same morning one of the officers came to Baldin 's tent and informed him that soldiers had found some drawings in the castle cellar . Baldin , an architect by profession , was known among his comrades as an expert in fine arts . Intrigued by the story , Baldin hurried to the castle . <p> The floor of the cellar was covered by drawings mounted on cardboard passe-partout , or backing . A brief look was enough for Baldin to understand what kind of treasure was lying under his feet . On the passe-partout familiar names were printed : Titian , Rembrandt , Rubens , Durer , Van Gogh , Goya , Cezanne . The secret shelter in the castle cellar contained 1,520 artworks belonging to the collection of the Bremen Kunsthalle , evacuated to protect them from Allied bombing raids . <p> Baldin immediately visited his commander to inform him of the discovery . As he recounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The commander listened to the young officer 's speech and then asked him : " How old are you ? " Baldin replied that he was 25 years old . The commander invited him to the window and showed him the brigade 's few trucks , overloaded with senior officers ' loot . " And now get out of here , " he told the young officer . <p> " I understood then that nobody would help me , " Baldin says . " I returned to the cellar and began to sort out the drawings in the candlelight . As the drawings were mounted in a heavy Bristol cardboard , it was impossible to carry more than 10 of them . But there were hundreds of drawings . With my heart standing still , I began to carefully cut out the thin leaves of paper from the passe-partout . On the back side of every drawing I wrote the name of the artist . It was after midnight , the candle was burning down , but I was cutting and cutting . <p> " I had to leave many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how was it possible to judge ? I believed that everything left in the cellar would be destroyed ... I carried an armful of drawings into my hut in the forest and painstakingly packed them in one of my valises . " <p> On the way home Baldin enriched his collection . The trucks transporting the brigades were decorated with drawings taken from the cellar by the soldiers . They were all of one type - sketches of nude women . Baldin exchanged these " pinup girls " drawn by Tiepolo , Rodin , and other famous artists , for German wristwatches , belts , and other minor trophies . <p> Baldin sacrificed a pair of perfect German boots for a Salvator Mundi painting by Durer . " Those boots were very good , " Baldin recalls nostalgically . <p> After returning home , Baldin continued his career as an architect , taking part in the restoration of the Holy Trinity monastery not far from Moscow . In 1947 he decided to donate the collection of drawings to the Museum of Architecture in Moscow . <p> The drawings remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed director of the museum . From the moment of his appointment , he began a crusade to return the drawings to Bremen . <p> Baldin began to write letters to Soviet leaders trying to convince them that the masterpieces must be returned to their owners . He sent messages to all Soviet rulers from Leonid Brezhnev to Mikhail Gorbachev but never received a reply . <p> The last letter was addressed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin . <p> " Do n't lose a chance to use this situation and do n't listen to those people who are trying to prevent this step , " Baldin wrote Yeltsin . " I am an old soldier and a museum curator . Before the end of my days I want to be sure that the unique drawings saved by me during the war are returned to the real owner - the museum of the city of Bremen - and become accessible to the public , to researchers , and are returned again to the culture of the world . " <p> On September 13 , 1991 , Yeltsin scrawled his decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically beneficial to return them . " <p> But the collection was not to be yielded so easily . At the same time , with the clear backing of the Soviet Ministry of Culture , a defamation campaign against Baldin was launched . Rather than a savior , Baldin was labeled in numerous newspaper articles as an " art thief . " <p> Finally , the collapse of the Soviet Union and the pressure from Germany and other nations led to the opening of the Bremen exhibit on November 18 , 1992 . <p> The exhibition included an additional surprise - besides the drawings removed by Baldin , the exposition included eight works from the same collection , among them six drawings by Durer . All these drawings were from the secret depository of the Hermitage , which includes more than 100 drawings from Bremen , donated or sold to the museum by soldiers who visited the famous cellar at the same time as Baldin . <p> While Mikhail Petrovsky , director of the Hermitage , finally included in the exhibition " classified " drawings by Durer , other museum directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents uncovered in Moscow archives , a number of other Bremen works are still held in the Pushkin Museum 's secret depository . In addition , according to reliable sources , some drawings from Bremen are being secretly held in provincial museums . <p> Museums are not the only hiding places . In 1978 , Felix Vishnevsky , a well-known Russian private collector , died in Moscow . His collection was of such great value that the Soviet Ministry of Culture delivered a special report on it to the Department of Culture of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee . <p> Among other treasures listed in the report as belonging to Vishnevsky were some trophy masterpieces , including paintings by Cranach , Giordano , and Klinger , looted from German museums such as the Dresden Gallery and the National Gallery in Berlin . On the list were 25 drawings from Bremen , including works by Durer and Rembrandt . <p> The fate of these works is not known . After the death of Vishnevsky 's widow , the collection was bequeathed to her son Evgeny and to Valentin Falin , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , who finished his career as head of the international department of the party 's Central Committee . Mr. Falin was a close friend and apparently a protector of Vishnevsky . <p> Baldin remembers that in the mid-1970s he visited the powerful Falin , trying to find support for his plan to return the drawings to Germany . Falin told him at that time of the presence of Bremen drawings in Vishnevsky 's collection . <p> There is also evidence that Vishnevsky was not the only private collector wranzow by some of Baldin 's comrades-in-arms . <p> The prospect is tantalizing enough that not only Russian mafiosi , but also German museum curators , are hunting for them . <p> As Baldin sat in his Moscow apartment , his recollections were interrupted at one point by his wife . " Oh , Victor , " she said , " why did you choose that castle for the camp , why did you take those drawings ? You created so many problems for yourself , for Russians , for Germans ... " <p> A slight smile crossed Baldin 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
