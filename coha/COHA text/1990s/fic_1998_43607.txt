A turquoise silk scarf , elegantly long , and narrow ; so delicately threaded with pale gold and silver butterflies , you might lose yourself in a dream contemplating it , imagining you 're gazing into another dimension or another time in which the heraldic butterflies are living creatures with slow , pulsing wings . <p> Eleven years old , I was searching for a birthday present for my mother . Mom she was to me though often in weak moments I 'd hear my voice cry Mommy . It was a windy grit-borne Saturday in late March , a week before Easter , and cold . Searching through the stores of downtown Strykersville . Not Woolworth 's , not Rexall 's Drugs , not Norban 's Discounts where a gang of girls might prowl after school but the " better " women 's stores where few of us went except with our mothers , and rarely even then . Saved jealously , in secret , for many months in a bunched-up white sock in my bureau drawer was eight dollars and sixty-five cents . Now in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sufficient , I believed , for a really nice , really special present for my mother . I was excited , nervous ; already I could see the surprised pleasure in my mother 's eyes as she unwrapped the box , and this was to be my reward . For there was a delicious way Mom had of squinching up her face , which was an unlined , pretty face , a young-woman face still ( my parents " ages were mysteries to me I would not have dared to penetrate but clearly they were " young " compared with most of my friends " parents-in their early thirties ) and saying , in her warm whispery voice , as if this were a secret between us , " Oh , honey , what have you done ! " I wanted to strike that match bringing out a warm startled glow in my mother 's face , that glisten in her eyes . I wanted to present my mother with , not a mere store-bought item , but a love offering . A talisman against harm . The perfect gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sorrow , illness , age and death and oblivion . The gift that says , I love you , you are life to me . Had I eighteen dollars , or eighty , I might have wished to spend every penny on this gift for my mother 's birthday . To hand over every penny I 'd saved , to make the transaction sacred . For I believed that this secretly hoarded money had to be surrendered to the proper authority , that the transaction be valid , and sacred ; that this mysterious authority resided in one of the " better " stores and nowhere else . So there was a heat , a feverish glare in my eyes ( that were said to be on even ordinary occasions strange-staring eyes like a cat 's ) . And there was an eager , awkward motion to my slight body , as if even as I lunged forward I was yet bracing myself , steeling myself , in a kind of physical chagrin . Naturally , I aroused suspicion in the primly well-dressed women who clerked in such stores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were several stores experienced in such a nightmare haze of blindness and breathlessness I was inside , and out , in a matter of seconds before even quite hearing the sharp query meant to intimidate and expel- " Yes ? May I assist you ? " At last I found myself amid glittery glass display cases and racks of beautiful leather goods hanging like the slain carcasses of animals . A well-worn parquet floor creaked incriminatingly beneath my feet . How had I dared enter Kenilworth 's Ladies Fashions , where mother never shopped ? What gusty wind had propelled me inside , like a taunting hand on the flat of my back ? The lady salesclerk , tight-corseted with a scratchy steel-wool bun at the nape of her neck and smacking-red downturned mouth , eyed my every movement up and down the dazzling aisles . " May I assist you , miss ? " this lady asked in a cold , doubtful voice . I murmured I was just looking . " Did you come to look , miss , or to buy ? " My face pounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This woman did n't trust me ! Though I was , at school , such a good girl ; such a diligent student ; always an A-student ; always a favorite of teachers ; one of those students who is on a teacher 's side in the fray , thus not to be despised . But here in Kenilworth 's , it seemed I was not trusted . I might have been a little colored girl for my dark hair was suspiciously curly-kinky like moist wires , and inclined to frizz like something demented . You would know , seeing me , that such a specimen could not drag a decent comb through that head of snarly hair . And my skin was olive-dark , not the wholesome buttermilk-pale , like the salesclerk 's powdered skin , that was preferred . Here was a poor girl , an ungainly girl , a shy girl , therefore a dishonest girl , a sneaky little shoplifter , just give her the chance , just turn your back for an instant . You 've heard of gypsies . There were no gypsies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet had there been gypsies , even a single sprawling family , it was clear I was one of their offspring with my soiled skin , shifty eyes , and rundown rubber boots . It was my ill luck that no other customers were in this department of Kenilworth 's at the moment and so the clerk might fiercely concentrate her attention on me . How prized I was , not requiring the usual courtesy and fawning over with which you must serve a true customer . For I was not a " customer " but an intruder , a trespasser . She expects me to steal-the thought rushed at me with the force of a radio news bulletin . What hurt and resentment I felt , what shame . Yet , how badly I would have liked , at that moment , to steal ; to slip something , oh anything ! in my pocket-a leather wallet , a small beaded handbag , a lacy white Irish linen handkerchief . But I dared not for I was a " good " girl who never , in the company of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake-gold hair barrettes , and key rings adorned with the ecstatic smiling faces of Jane Russell , Linda Darnell , Debra Paget , and Lana Turner from Woolworth 's . So I stood paralyzed in the gaze of the woman salesclerk ; caught between the perception of my deepest wish ( until that moment unknown to me ) and my perception of the futility of that wish . She wants me to steal but I ca n't . I wo n't . In a weak voice I said , " It 's for my mother-a birthday present . How much is-this ? " I 'd been staring at a display of scarves . The price tags on certain of the items of merchandise-the wallets , the handbags , even gloves and handkerchiefs-were so absurdly high , my eye took them in even as my brain repelled them , as information bits not to be assimilated . Scarves , I seemed to believe , would be more reasonably priced . And what beautiful scarves were on display-I stared almost without comprehension at these lovely colors , these exquisite fabrics and designs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the kind I wore most of the winter , that tied tightly beneath the chin ; scarves that kept one 's hair from whipping into snarls , kept ears and neck warm ; scarves that looked , at their frequent worst , not unlike bandages wrapped around the head . These scarves were works of art . They were made of fine silk , or very light wool ; they were extravagantly long , or triangular ; some were squares ; some were enormous , with fringes-perhaps these were shawls . There were paisley prints , there were floral prints , there were gossamer scarves , gauzy scarves , scarves boldly printed with yellow jonquils and luscious red tulips , scarves wispy as those dreams of surpassing sweetness that , as we wake and yearn to draw them after us , break and disintegrate like strands of cobweb . Blindly I pointed at-I did n't dare touch-the most beautiful of the scarves , turquoise , a fine delicate silk patterned with small gold and silver figures I could n't quite decipher . Through her pinched-looking bifocals the salesclerk peered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That scarf is pure silk , from China . That scarf is- " Pausing then to consider me as if for the first time . Maybe she felt in the air the tremor and heat of my blood . Maybe it was simple pity . This utterly mysterious transaction , one of those unfathomable and incalculable events that mark at rare intervals the inner curve of our lives , gratuitous moments of grace . In a lowered , more kindly voice , though with an edge of adult annoyance , the salesclerk said , " It 's ten dollars . Plus tax . " Ten dollars . Like a child in an enchantment I began numbly to remove my savings from my pocket , six wrinkled dollars and nickels , dimes , a single quarter , and numerous pennies , counting them with frowning earnestness as if I had n't any idea what they might add up to . The sharp-eyed salesclerk said irritably , " -I mean eight dollars . It 's been marked down to eight dollars for our Easter sale . " Eight dollars ! I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : " Relief so flooded me I might have fainted . I was smiling , triumphant . I could n't believe my good luck even as , with childish egotism , I never paused to doubt it . Eagerly I handed over my money to the salesclerk , who rang up the purchase with that curious prickly air of impatience , as if I 'd embarrassed her ; as if I were , not an intruder in Kenilworth 's after all , but a child-relative of hers she did not wish to acknowledge . As she briskly wrapped the boxed scarf in glossy pink paper stamped with HAPPY BIRTHDAY ! I dared raise my eyes and saw with a mild shock that the woman was n't so old as I 'd thoughtnot much older than my mother . Her hair was a thin , graying brown caught in an angry-looking bun , her face was heavily made-up yet not pretty , her bright lipstick-mouth downturned . When she handed me the gift-wrapped box in a Kenilworth 's silver-striped bag she said , frowning at me through her eyeglasses , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tag is off . " Mother insists , But I have no more use for this , dear . Please take it . Rummaging through closets , bureau drawers of the old house soon to be sold to strangers . In her calm melodic voice that belies the shakiness of her hands , saying , If-later-something happens to me-I do n't want it to be lost . Each visit back home , Mother has more to give me . Things once precious out of the ever-more remote , receding past . What is the secret meaning of such gift-giving by a woman of eightythree , do n't inquire . Mother speaks often , vaguely , of lost . She fears papers being lost-insurance policies , medical records . Lost is a bottomless ravine into which you might fall , and fall . Into which her several sisters and brothers have disappeared one by one , and a number of her friends . And Father-has it already been a year ? So that , for the remainder of her life , Mother 's life grown mysterious to her as a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption of lucidity she will wake in the morning wondering where has Dad gone . She reaches out and there 's no one beside her , so she tells herself , He 's in the bathroom . And , almost , she can hear him in there . Later she thinks , He must be outside . And , almost , she can hear the lawn mower . Or she thinks , He 's taken the car . And gone-where ? " Here ! Here it is . " At the bottom of a drawer in a bedroom bureau , Mother has found what she 's been searching for with such concentration . This afternoon she has pressed upon me a square-cut amethyst in an antique setting , a ring once belonging to her mother-in-law , and a handwoven potholder only just perceptibly marred by scorch . And now she opens a long flat box , and there it is , amid tissue paper : the silk turquoise scarf with its pale heraldic butterflies . For a moment , I ca n't speak . I 've gone entirely numb . Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proudly , " Your father gave it to me . When we were just married . It was my favorite scarf but you can see-it was too pretty to wear , and too thin . So I put it away . " " But you did wear it , Mother . I remember . " " Did I ? " - that look of veiled , just perceptible annoyance . She does n't wish to be corrected . Saying , " Please take it , dear . It would make me happy if you did . " " But- " " I do n't have any use for it , and I do n't want it to get lost . " I lift the turquoise scarf from the box , staring . Admiring . In fact its label is French , not Chinese . In fact the turquoise is n't so vivid as I would have remembered . Fifty years ago , on what would have been her thirty-third birthday , my mother had opened her present with an odd air of anxiety ; the luxuriant wrapping , the embossed silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking the scarf from the box she 'd been speechless for a long moment before saying , " Why , honey-it 's beautiful . How did you- " Her voice , usually so confident , trailed off . As if words failed her . Or , with her subtle sense of tact , she believed it would be rude to make such an inquiry even of an eleven-year-old daughter . That talisman that says I love you . You are life to me . This luminous silky scarf imprinted with butterflies like ancient heraldic coins . It 's the kind of imported , expensive scarf stylish women are wearing today , flung casually over their shoulders . I ask my mother if she 's certain she wants to give away the scarf , though I know the answer : for Mother has come to an age when she knows exactly what she wants and what she does n't want , what she needs and does n't need . Saying yes , she 's certain , arranging the scarf around my neck , tying the ends , untying the ends , frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's beautiful on you . "
