Raleigh , North Carolina COMPOSTING FOOD RESIDUALS FROM THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS <p> While 10,000 athletes and thousands of volunteers gathered in North Carolina for the 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games , state government employees and volunteers were busy turning their food residuals into compost . Volunteers from the state 's Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) , North Carolina State University ( NCSU ) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill teamed up to divert almost 11 tons of cafeteria leftovers . The materials were taken to compost sites at NCSU and in Orange County . <p> " This was the largest food compost collection and diversion project in North Carolina 's history , " notes Craig Coker , DENR 's organics recycling coordinator . " It 's also the first organics recycling effort ever attempted by the Special Olympics World Summer Games . " The program was part of Governor Jim Hunt 's North Carolina Project Green program , a massive state government effort to expand environmental sustainability programs . Hunt challenged state employees last September to set an example for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state government . For more information on the composting project , contact Craig Coker of DENR at ( 919 ) 715-6524 . Eddyville , Iowa COMPOST FACILITY TARGETS FOOD PROCESSING FEEDSTOCKS <p> Sherry Baker , a project manager with Chamness Technology , Inc . ( CTI ) , provides the following information on composting operations at its 80-acre facility , which began operations in March and will have its grand opening celebration this month . <p> The 3.75-acre receiving , blending and grinding area is asphalted  --  as is the 10-acre windrow area . All operations are outdoors , and there is a five-acre curing area . The finished product is screened on-site and sold in bulk . <p> The facility was sited in Eddyville to target the expanding biotechnology and food processing industries in the region . It will also accept leaves , grass clippings and wood residuals from local communities . CTI is investing over $3 million in the site , which is designed to accept up to 100,000 tons of material annually . The 80-acre site includes a no discharge runoff containment and recycling system . CTI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds Baker . Several businesses in the region have already benefited from the facility by lowering their waste disposal costs and dramatically increasing their recycling rates . <p> As part of the Solid Waste Alternatives Program , the Iowa Department of Natural Resources provided CTI $650,000 in grants and loans to build the Eddyville Facility , and recently awarded CTI and Iowa State University a $150,000 grant to research the use of compost on row crops . The goal of this project is to develop agricultural markets for the compost . <p> CTI , formerly known as Horizon Technology , is owned by Gary Chamness and is based in Blairsburg , Iowa . The company was started in 1988 , and provides a wide range of waste handling services . A detailed report on operations at the facility and end product uses will be given by Baker at the BioCycle Midwest Conference in Cedar Rapids October 25 , 26 , 27 , 1999 . ( See conference program in this issue . ) Toronto , Ontario 3,000 OUTDOOR RECYCLING BINS WILL BE INSTALLED <p> The City Council awarded a contract last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter containers throughout most parts of Toronto . The bins have one compartment for paper , one for glass , metal and plastic containers , and one for garbage , reports the Recycling Council of Ontario 's RCO RE-News . The move follows a pilot program showing that clear labeling of compartments minimizes contamination of the two recycling streams . <p> The contractor , Olifas Marketing Group ( OMG ) , will provide and maintain the bins , and pay the city about $12.9 million over ten years , which should be more than enough to cover the city 's additional recycling collection and sorting costs of $7 million to $10 million over the decade . OMG plans to sell advertising space on the bins , which has caused some areas of the city to reject installation . Hood River , Oregon PROCESSING ORGANICS INTO A HUMUS PRODUCT <p> Ralph Gilbert operates a 200,000 tons/year dry materials recovery facility through his company , ECR , charging a $62.50/ton tipping fee for materials such as cardboard , metal , paper , concrete , asphalt , tile , toilets and ceramics  --  anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past seven years , Gilbert also has been testing a method of processing wet organics . Now ECR is part of a joint venture with Stewart Farms , also in Hood River , to operate a humus processing facility expected to open its doors in a few months . Construction began last month after conditional use and Department of Environmental Quality permits were received . The tipping fee has yet to be determined . Wood scraps , manure and certain food residuals will be measured and combined in a specific recipe , then processed outdoors using a proprietary method developed through ECR 's testing . San Jose , California WORMS RECYCLE FOOD RESIDUALS AT EXTENSION CENTER <p> A two-year demonstration project on food residuals composting is underway at the Bay Area Research Extension Center ( BAREC ) , reports Karin Grobe , who is with Agriculture in Partnership with San Jose . A vermicomposting unit has been set up by Vaishali Tamhankar of the Institute of Natural Organic Agriculture in India , where she has established worm composting systems that handle up to 11 tons of residuals per day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , has been established in a greenhouse at BAREC to compost one ton of vegetable and fruit residuals per month . " Santa Clara County has many small farms growing vegetables , cut flowers and other value crops , " explains farm advisor Maria de la Fuente . " Results of this research project will be directly communicated to these farmers to help them increase soil fertility and water holding capacity , and reduce chemical use . " The research  --  which will evaluate comparative plot trials with chili peppers and crop quality  --  is sponsored by the city of San Jose and Agriculture in Partnership program . Harrisburg , Pennsylvania RECYCLING PROGRAMS GET $9.8 MILLION TO REACH 35 PERCENT GOAL <p> " We 're moving recycling forward to reach our new goal of 35 percent by 2002 , " said Pennsylvania Lt. Governor Mark Schweiker last month while announcing awards of $9.8 million to municipalities " to insure that Pennsylvania continues to be a national recycling leader . " Adams County received $150,000 to further revise its plans to build a composting facility . Philadelphia County received $75,320 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recycling programs included : Allegheny County  --  $488,700 for dropoff recycling and recycling education ; Coraopolis  --  $70,326 for curbside recycling and yard trimmings collection ; Monroeville  --  $52,845 for curbside recycling and yard trimmings collection ; Reading  --  $54,808 for yard trimmings composting ; Sinking Spring  --  $18,450 for yard trimmings collection . Other towns receiving funds specifically for yard trimmings collection included Robesonia , Beaver , Altoona , Lower Makefield , Johnstown , Titusville , Camp Hill , Cumberland County , Edinboro , Harborcreek Township , Platea , Ephrata and Annville Township . <p> A number of grants were earmarked specifically for composting  --  both at centralized facilities as well as in backyards . They included awards to State College ( $290,114 ) , Chester County ( $52,775 ) , Uniontown ( $57,832 ) , Lower Macungie Township ( $71,010 ) , Wilkes-Barre ( $44,217 ) , Greenville ( $58,897 ) and Upper Merion Township ( $273,800 ) . <p> There were also grants aimed to process and reuse woody residuals  --  such as Wallace Township ( $21,097 ) , Steelton ( $13,792 ) , Northeast Township ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $27,832 ) , and Quemahoning Township ( $19,030 ) . Santa Rosa , California NATURAL FOOD MARKETS COMPOST ON-SITE <p> Through a county rebate program , Ernie Shelton , owner of three Food For Thought Markets in Sonoma County , purchased three in-vessel units to compost produce residuals . He installed two of the units in his 23,000-square-foot store in Santa Rosa and one unit in his 10,000-square-foot store in Sebastapol . <p> Shelton says he got interested in composting through the University of California Cooperative Extension of Sonoma County , which was helping local businesses set up on-site composting for their food residuals . A waste audit funded by the extension service for all three of Shelton 's markets showed that produce accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the weight going into the dumpsters . <p> Shelton purchased Earth Tubs manufactured by Green Mountain Technologies through a rebate program offered by the Sonoma County Waste Management Agency , which paid one-third of the cost . <p> The in-vessel systems are used to recycle fruit and vegetable residuals from the markets ' produce departments and delis . Each tub can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food residuals generated by each of the two markets . <p> The store manager oversees the composting operation . " We devote a half to three-quarters of an hour a day to the composting process , " says Shelton . Wood chips from the county landfill and sawdust from a lumber company are used as carbon sources . " Even though there was an initial expense , composting has lowered our trash bill by 25 percent , which was running at $1,700 a month . " Hanover , New Hampshire INDUSTRY FUNDS STUDY OF PAPER PRODUCTS ' COMPOSTABILITY <p> DSM Environmental Services , Inc. , an environmental consulting firm in Ascutney , Vermont , is completing a study of the compostability and marketability of laminated paper products . Started in May , the study was funded by the American Forest and Paper Association of Washington , D.C. " They wanted a better idea of how quickly laminated paper products would break down in our system and how their addition would affect the marketability of the end product , " notes John Fay , a research associate with DSM . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are composted at the facility using the same technology . DSM began operating the facility in August , 1998 and collects approximately 15 yards a week of pre and post-consumer food residuals , as well as paper products and wax paper from food service areas and restaurants at Dartmouth College . ( See " Innovative Plan For Cocomposting , " May , 1998 . ) <p> For the study , two batches of paper products and food residuals weighing a total of 17.3 tons were composted at the Hanover-Dartmouth Compost Facility in Hanover , New Hampshire , which is operated by DSM and owned by Resource Optimization Technologies . " Most of the breakdown of the paper products has been in the first few weeks , " notes Fay . " The process usually takes 90 days from start to finish , but it 's taken longer because we are operating at a smaller volume than our full capacity . <p> " We 're doing our own assessment of the marketability of the compost . We 've found that once we screen the material , everyone wants it . The laminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're not visible . " Fay says DSM expects to complete analysis of the study 's data by the end of September . New Orleans , Louisiana FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM <p> The City Council has decided to fund residential curbside recycling through the end of the year , but its future is in doubt . An unexpected $1.4 million shortfall in the Department of Sanitation has endangered the program , which has only a 6.3 percent diversion rate . It includes a Si/household fee and collects about 15,000 tons/year . The materials recycled are OCC , ONP , aluminum cans , tin cans , and glass and plastic containers . <p> The program lacks an educational element as well as a professional recycling coordinator , according to Shama Farooq of the Community Outreach Center of Tulane Environmental Law Clinic . " City politicians have shown almost no interest in pursuing a progressive recycling program , " she says . " We do n't really have a professional recycling director at the helm . We do n't have that expertise . " A citizens task force is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the collection rate and decrease costs . Harrisburg , Pennsylvania COMPOSTING ASSOCIATION MEETING <p> The Pennsylvania Composting Association ( PACA ) is holding a free seminar and roundtable discussion October 14 on the state 's first in-vessel composting system for source separated organics , which will be located at the Crawford County jail . In addition , regulatory updates on compost production and use from the solid waste and biosolids perspectives will be discussed .
