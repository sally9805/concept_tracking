MORNING <p> Alvin Bishop rises at dawn and faces east , framed in his bedroom window , a thin , naked man , skin the white of flour , hair wild from sleep and as dark as the earth . The sun 's light , but not the sun , is visible to him , as if the thing itself were buried nightly beneath the rows of restless wheat , lighting them now so that they turn the blue of water . <p> Leskirk , Kansas , lies in a part of the Midwest that has little to recommend it but the spectacular flat nothingness that makes it unbearable . Occasionally , a rare spring morning or exceptional summer dusk , the fields stretch to a vanishing point so distant Alvin can see for himself that the world is round . On his best days , he manages to think of these acres of land as the earth 's crown . <p> He stands at his bedroom window , his hands joining at his crotch , as if to be modest . <p> AFTERNOON <p> When he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocery . <p> " It 's the shadow of the elevator , " she tells him . " It divides our house in two . " She rocks back and forth quickly on their bed , which she has stripped to the mattress pad . <p> Alvin hears the bedsprings , the frenetic rhythm of her movement , the repetitive groan of the springs . <p> " It turns our pillows gray , " Rita says . " It blackens our sheets . It 's the elevator . If you want to be honest about us , you have to start with the shadow of the elevator . " <p> A crackling silence follows . " Rita , " Alvin begins , as lost in the silence as he was in her talk , " did you eat lunch ? Did you remember the chili in the refrigerator ? " <p> Rita rubs her hands over the dark stains on the mattress pad-human stains , she thinks , a whole life could be read by these stains : blood , urine , saliva , sweat , sex . She begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Darkness , once it touches a bed  --  " <p> " I 've got a customer , " Alvin tells her . A man , his green Peterbilt cap visible above the aisles , stalls at the windows of beer and pop , staring into the cooler . <p> " So do I , " she says and hangs up . She presses her face against the mattress , believing she is about to cry . She feels the pressure behind her eyes , but the tears do not come . She pulls the pad from the bed and carries it to the washing machine . There are days she does nothing but clean . <p> In high school , sixteen years past , she used to pretend a movie camera followed her around . She and Alvin were the stars of a romantic film . Now she wishes it were literally true , that an invisible camera followed them , and each night before bed they watched themselves , the film making their lives tangible , teaching them how to live , how to recover , slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this record , things just keep happening . Their lives quietly slip away . <p> THE ELEVATOR <p> Rounded , whitewashed , and fifteen stories high , the grain elevator rises above the puny houses of Leskirk , Kansas , like a bleached column of smoke . Its shadow blackens the western side of town mornings , the eastern half afternoons . During the summer months , the shadow of the elevator reaches the Bishop house by twelve-thirty , dividing it laterally , shadow and light . <p> At one time they thought of it as summer shade . <p> EVENING <p> Evenings are measured by cars and pickups , stray diesels hissing by on 96 , people coming from or going to Pueblo , a few to some place more distant : Wichita , Kansas City , Albuquerque , Phoenix . Alvin Bishop knows there are a million places your life can take you . For better or worse , his has taken him here . <p> He stands behind the short Formica counter of his grocery , stalling . Already he has restocked and straightened the shelves , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little accounting he had to do is complete , figures checked and double-checked . He does n't want to go home . Rita is likely still up . Some nights he ca n't face her . <p> He switches off the lights , sits on his stool , resting his elbows on the counter . He thinks this : There must be a hundred ways to ruin you life , a thousand ways to lose the people you love . It seems to him that life is a thing given to you , then taken back a little bit at a time . <p> Headlights illuminate the grocery 's glass door . A yellow triangle grows on the linoleum as the car approaches . Just as the door is about to turn to a sheet of light , it goes dark instead , filled with a tall and ornate figure , a human silhouette that calls to Alvin 's mind images of those Oriental gods who have extra arms . <p> After the startle wears off , he makes out the figure to be a normal human , hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light at the crooks of the elbows , belly round and distended with child . He unlocks the door and lets in Karla Boyer , a black woman , a regular customer . <p> " Thank god , " she says . She has been crying . <p> " Has something happened ? " he asks her , but she raises her slender hand , a signal to wait , then turns to put on a new face . She comes to the store daily to buy the few necessities of a woman living by herself , and to smoke a cigarette . She is almost six feet tall , five months pregnant , the only black person in Leskirk , a resident of a few weeks ' duration . <p> " Are you all right ? " Alvin asks her . <p> " I need a cigarette . " Her voice is flat but friendly . <p> She first came into the store during the last frost of April wearing a gold billowy blouse and red stretch pants . She asked him then if he would sell her cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to smoke at all , " she had explained , unembarrassed , " but I 've been cheating . " She began coming by in the afternoons , the dead hours before quitting time at the elevator , and smoked one or two mentholated cigarettes at the counter while paging through magazines . Eventually , she and Alvin began talking and became friends . <p> Alvin hands her a True from the open package he keeps for her beneath the counter . <p> " You know anything about having babies ? " she asks him casually , then immediately lights the cigarette . <p> " There are some things I know about it , " he says . <p> She flashes a smile , white and square , as if he is flirting . " I know nausea is part of the deal , " she tells him , " but I get headaches , long ticking headaches . You ever get a tick in your head ? " Her long hair falls stylishly to one side . She has dressed as if going to a play or an expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headaches , " he says . " The first few months she was pregnant . They went away after a while . " <p> " Rita is your wife ? " <p> He nods . She inhales smoke . He stays behind the counter , resting on the stool . Each has a hand on the Formica top . <p> " Are you aware that the nearest television repairman is twenty-five miles from here ? " She holds the cigarette upright beside her face . Except for a ray of moonlight entering through the door , the cigarette is the only illumination in the room . <p> " You have to go to Leoti , " he says . <p> " All day I look forward to a smoke . " She takes another long puff . " And eating . I eat a meal every hour  --  sometimes just out of boredom . " <p> " We have paperbacks , " he tells her . <p> " I 've read until my mind is spilling over with little black words . Did your wife gain weight ? I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obesity . My father got fat . " <p> " Rita lost what weight she gained , " Alvin says . <p> " I 've got to have another , " she announces , shaking her head , her hair following the motion like a whip . " I knocked on my neighbor 's door to see if he smoked . I 've been dying for one . " She lights the cigarette with her pocket lighter . " I walked down to the cafe , which was closed . " <p> Suddenly she is crying again . She covers her eyes and turns her back to him once more . <p> Alvin reaches across the counter and touches her padded shoulder with his hand . <p> She faces him , wiping her eyes . " It 's terrible to be where you do n't know one person who you can bum a cigarette off . " She shakes her head , her hair once again a whip , then flashes another smile . " Did your wife get weepy when she was pregnant ? " <p> His hand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lowers it . " She still gets that way , " he says . <p> Karla does n't like this answer , as if he is ridiculing either Rita or her . She looks out the door as she smokes , one arm resting on her belly , the other at her lips . A new pair of headlights approach . <p> Alvin does n't want her to think he is making fun of her . He says , " I get a ticking in my head sometimes . Feels like a guy with boots is marching in there . " <p> She tilts her head toward the floor , looks at him through the tops of her eyes . Behind her , the door turns white . Light shines through the curls of her hair . He sees that she is a beautiful woman . He had n't noticed that before . Maybe because she is pregnant . Or because she is as tall as he is . Because she is black . There is no way for him to know . <p> " You should quit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He nods . <p> She leans against the counter . " Why does your wife get weepy , Mr. Bishop ? " <p> This question turns his throat sour as if he 's swallowed acid . He stares at his pale hands on the counter . " She 's not well . Sometimes she gets sad . " <p> " Do you have any idea what brought it on ? " Karla asks , smoke in her speech . " Was she always . . . sensitive ? " She smiles a little as she says this . <p> " I 'm not going to say anything against her . " <p> " Who 's asking you to ? " She dismisses him with a wave of her cigarette . " I 'm just curious . You 're my only friend here and I do n't even know you . " <p> " For starts , call me Alvin , " he says . <p> " Not too often I meet an Alvin . " <p> She says this as if it is funny . It momentarily angers him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he tells her . <p> " What 's to know ? " She waves the hand with the cigarette contemptuously . " I got knocked up and decided to have the baby in private . " <p> " Why here ? " <p> " No one I know would ever come here . Now , what 's the story with your wife ? " <p> He settles back against the stool , sighs , and begins . " Rite went to college three years before we got married . She reads a lot  --  used to , anyway . One afternoon she was reading and forgot the baby 's feeding time . She was caught up in the book and forgot . I guess she was twenty minutes late . When she went to the crib , Linda  --  that was my daughter 's name  --  Linda had quit breathing . " <p> " The baby died ? " Karla freezes for a moment , then the glowing ash of the cigarette slowly descends until it is even with her waist . " Oh , Alvin , " she cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why would a baby die from eating a little late ? " <p> He shakes his head , but the room has grown darker . He 's not sure how well she can see . " Had nothing to do with it . A crib death . The doctor said it just happens . Some babies come with their deaths built-in , and there 's nothing you can do about it . " The cigarette briefly lights the ribbed fabric of her dress , which is stretched tight across her middle like a forced smile . " I should n't be telling you this , " he says , suddenly ashamed , " you of all people . " <p> " I asked you . " <p> " You do n't need to worry . It 's more rare than people realize . I read up on it . " Alvin remembers well how pregnant women worry . Rita had to be assured nightly that she 'd eaten enough protein , drunk enough milk , that she was doing a good job . He ca n't imagine a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of it , " he says softly , " is that Rita has n't been the same . " <p> Karla finishes her cigarette . She grinds it with her heel into the linoleum . " Is she getting better , Alvin ? " <p> " Sometimes , " he says . " Sometimes not . " <p> She thanks him for the smokes . Before she leaves , she pats his hand , which is still on the counter . <p> NIGHT <p> " Alvin . " Rita calls his name into the dark house although he is right beside her , his head on the pillow next to hers . " Alvin , Alvin . " She says his name not so much out of fear but as if she is naming a whole row of children the same thing . " Alvin . " <p> " What , baby ? " He sits up , touches her bare shoulder . Her hair is pulled back and knotted so tightly that she looks continually surprised . <p> " Alvin , I was thinking about this , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her little fist taps his thigh . She has slept in her bathrobe , a slate blue like winter skies . The belt has pulled loose . One side bunches at her elbow , leaving a breast exposed . The baby is fourteen months dead . Her breasts no longer carry milk . <p> " I 'm right here , Rita , " he says and shifts his weight on the bed , bouncing against the mattress . When she is having a bad night , he has to let her know he is there every second . Bouncing is one way ; talk , another . <p> " I was thinking that children can always be counted on to be children , but grown-ups ca n't be counted on for anything . I was thinking how adults can be like children when you need them to be grown , and then all the petals drop off your plans , do n't they , Alvin ? " <p> " I guess , " he says uncertainly . " Sure . " <p> " You fall and you wait for someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No one comes , " he says . <p> " You know that one . I can drink something now . Do you think ? A little water now , and I 'll do the rugs . " She pauses , thinking . When she speaks again her voice is thin and full of disappointment , but by the end of the sentence there is amusement in it . " What was it we were going to do with the rugs , Alvin ? " <p> It is after three in the morning . She had been dreaming of sleep , watching herself in her dream as she slept , waking in her dark bed without ever waking in the dream . He had been dreaming , too , not of Karla exactly , but her silhouette , the odd and intricate shape her body had taken . <p> " Would you like to hear a song ? " he asks . " We could sing one together . ' Never Ending Love ' ? Or ' Our House ' ? " <p> " You do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get for marrying you , " she says . There are tears . " Oh , this house is sad . And I sweat . My breasts sweat . " <p> " It 's the middle of the night , " he tells her , his voice more angry than he intended . " You need to get some sleep , Rita . I do , too . " <p> She slumps back to her pillow , pulls the sheet over her head . <p> " Do n't be upset , " he says , but she does n't move . " I have a never ending love for you , " he sings softly , continuing in a whisper until he feels her body soften with sleep . <p> MADNESS <p> Alvin falls in love with Karla . They stand on their separate sides of the grocery counter and talk every day . He tells her about the ways his life has turned bad , the mistakes he 's made . He tells her how he grew up among a little group of farms known informally as Bishop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of this , but none of them had liked his grandfather . The lies it took to preserve his status proved too much for Alvin to bear . He sold his share of the farm and moved away , though only a few dozen miles . He built a little grocery on the highway . <p> When he opened the store , he decided , foolishly , not to put in a gas pump . It cost a lot of money initially , and there was something about it he did n't like . But people who are going somewhere do n't like to stop more often than they have to . Alvin understands that now . He made a mistake . Then Linda was born . Then Linda died . <p> He tells Karla these facts of his life , and , telling her , he falls in love . In time , she begins to confide in him . <p> " I 'm getting paid to have this baby , " she says . " I 'm a surrogate . " She pauses and touches her stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to tell her . They are at the counter , each on their own side . She says , " There 's this thing living inside me that I both love and hate . " <p> Alvin says , " When grain prices are low , an elevator fills , and eventually the grain ferments . You can smell it all over . If the prices stay low and the summer is hot , the grain may ferment so fast that an elevator will explode . It 's happened places . " <p> " Yes , " she says , walking to the door to look at the elevator , " that 's just the way I feel . " <p> He steps from behind the counter and stands beside her . The elevator shines painfully white . He says , " It looks like the barrel of a gun , does n't it ? " <p> " You 're imagining , " she tells him , then smiles slightly . He touches her cheek . Only for a second . <p> During the afternoon of the day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage room  --  standing , her elbows against the white block wall , his hands measuring the expanse of her growing abdomen . <p> HISTORY <p> Alvin and Rita met in high school . They dated for two years , nothing more than kissing , touching , and a great deal of talk . She went to Norman to study romance languages . He went to Fort Hays as an agriculture major . He lasted seven months ; she , six semesters . They ran into each other at the movies one night after they had n't seen one another for two years . They made love in his Ford Falcon and got married a few months later . They worked together at the store until late in her pregnancy . <p> White Woman Creek twists through Leskirk , a measly wash , dry ten months a year , its name the legacy of a Plains Indian tribe whose descendants live now on reservations in Oklahoma and New Mexico . Alvin and Rita often went to a desolate spot in White Woman Creek when they were first married . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For this reason , Alvin feels ashamed when he takes Karla there . That 's the very nature of love , he decides . It makes things special , which ruins them . <p> The night , clear and starry and hot , hovers over Kansas , the horizon still light . Alvin feels the same , as if gravity has let up on him , and there is n't much holding him to the earth . <p> " No one comes out here ? " Karla asks him , unbuttoning her blouse . " No one will see ? " <p> " It 's not likely . " He resists the urge to tell her he 's come here before for the same purpose . <p> Stalks of corn border the creek bed in rows , like spectators . Karla and Alvin lie across the blanket at an angle , so that it becomes a white diamond , whiter even than his skin . The surrounding stalks of corn genuflect now and again to an invisible , gusting wind . Eventually , she kneels . They make love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman before ? " she asks him . <p> " I 'd never touched a black woman before , " he says . <p> " My mother is white , " she tells him . <p> He does n't reply . They do n't talk again until they are finished , lying side by side on the blanket , beneath a sky now filled with stars . <p> " You do n't like to talk while we do it , do you ? " She runs her hand across his bare chest . " Rita does n't talk when you make love to her ? " <p> " What kind of question is that ? " <p> " Perfectly good question . Do you sleep with your wife or not ? " <p> " Not for a long time , " he says . <p> She puts her lips to his ears , whispers , " You should . " She turns and lies flat on her back . " If you do n't , I 'm not going to do this anymore . " <p> " I do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , as if she is about to conduct an orchestra . " She 's your wife . You should sleep with her . You should make love with you wife . " She folds her arms across her chest , takes her breasts in her hands . " I had tiny breasts before I was pregnant . I was always self-conscious about them . I refused to let boys see me in a bathing suit when I was in high school . " She laughs . " Now , here I am fat as the moon and naked in a creek bed with some white man , and I do n't feel self-conscious at all . " She sits up , with some difficulty . " You want to know a secret ? " <p> " Yeah , " he says , " I 'd like that . " A little wind blows over them , rustling the dry grass along the bank . <p> " When my father was in college , he injured himself . He twisted his knee during basketball practice . The team 's physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked . You know what that man told him ? He said , ' If you were a horse , I 'd shoot you . ' Can you imagine saying that to a person ? " She lifts her hair from her neck and looks up into the dark sky , as if the stars might answer her . <p> LOVE <p> By the end of Karla 's seventh month , she can no longer make love . Still they meet nightly  --  to talk , to hold hands , to watch the ghosts her television produces . Occasionally , they handle one another . Most nights they merely lie side by side in Karla 's bed and say almost nothing . <p> Twice , they fight . Once because he asks where she grew up . He knows she came to Leskirk from Tulsa , but she does n't sound to Alvin like an Okie . <p> " You mean I do n't sound like an Okie rigger , do n't you ? " she accuses . <p> He tells her no , but they fight anyway . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made love with Rita . <p> " Then leave , " she says . <p> He wants to know why . <p> " Because you 're not the man I thought you were . " <p> Alvin knows he has done bad things in his life . He knows some would count sleeping with Karla among them . He knows many would mark it as the worst . He considers making love with his wife in order to please his mistress as the worst . He wonders how much worse a human can do . <p> " Alvin , " Rita says . " You love me , Alvin ? " They are in bed . He has crawled on top of her . " Alvin , " she says and wraps her arms around his head , clutching him against her chest . " I 'm afraid of this , " she whispers , then kisses him . " I 'm afraid of this , " she whispers again . <p> He wants to concentrate on her worry , but what he thinks of is Karla who always talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to be afraid , " he tells his wife . <p> She squeezes shut her eyes . Near the end , she whispers , " We could do a child . " <p> " Is that why you 're scared ? " he asks . <p> " That 's most of it , " she tells him . <p> Afterwards , she rests her head in the crook of his arm . They lie together for several minutes , quiet and close , as they had lain many times before the trouble . He spoils it , but he wants to know . <p> " What 's the rest of it ? " he says . " Why else are you afraid to make love with me ? " <p> She says , " I 've been kind of crazy , have n't I ? I have . I 've been a little crazy , Alvin . Do n't you think ? " <p> " You 've been upset , " he says . " You 've been sick . " <p> She moves her hands in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know you 've been seeing somebody . " <p> Alvin 's breath catches in his throat . For several seconds , neither of them does anything but breathe . <p> " I thought I was already certain , " she tells him . " Then tonight . Then now . I 'm completely sure because of now . " She is quiet another moment before she says , " I get confused , except for this one thing  --  I know . If you do n't stop seeing her , I 'll leave you . " <p> The night drags on into morning . Alvin sleeps fitfully . He thinks of the day they came home from the Leoti hospital without their daughter . How still and blank the air had become , how cruel the bright colors of toys had become , how suddenly and unexpectedly an ordinary life became extraordinary and awful , and then , with incredible swiftness , ordinary again , full of ordinary madness and anger , and long ticking months of ordinary sorrow . <p> He lies in bed with his weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and makes Rita breakfast  --  toast , scrambled eggs , bacon . He intends to go to the grocery before lunch , but he watches television with Rita awhile and becomes sleepy . The store remains closed . He spends the afternoon in their bedroom , watching the shadow of the elevator turn the walls dark , examining the simple facts of his life : Rita is sick but she will likely get better . Even if she does n't , she deserves his love . Karla will be gone in little more than a month . Even if he decides he is willing to go with her , there is less than half a chance she will want him along . <p> It is there in the darkening room that he decides to stop seeing Karla . He will give her a carton of cigarettes and say goodbye . He will kiss her slender hand and wish her good luck . <p> The decision brings a lightness to his chest and shoulders , to his weary heart . <p> LOVE <p> Why , then , does he find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he listen to her soft breathing and fill a spiral notebook with words of love for her ? Why does he lay his hand on her belly to feel the bump and kick of a baby that is not his and is not even hers ? Why is it when he stares out her window at the wheat fields he sees the crown of the earth , shining and golden in the dying sunlight ? <p> Because there are ten thousand ways to ruin your life , a million ways to lose the people you love . This is the way Alvin has chosen . This one is his . <p> <p> By Robert Boswell <p>
