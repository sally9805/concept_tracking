Sometimes Nick felt as if they blamed him for everything . For betrayal and adultery , arson and jail . Even terrorism . Blamed him for overturning the whole established order . <p> CAROL AND ROBERT NORRIS were old friends of Nick 's wife , Joanne . They 'd known her for years , long before Nick met her . They 'd known her since back when she 'd been married to Bill Daly . In those days , the four of them-Carol and Robert , Joanne and Bill-were newlyweds and graduate students in the university art department . They lived in the same house , a big house on Seattle 's Capitol Hill , where they shared the rent , and a bathroom . They took many of their meals together and sat up late talking and drinking wine . They handed the work they 'd done around to each other for criticism and inspection . They even , in the last year they shared the house together-before Nick appeared on the scene and met Joanne-bought an inexpensive little sailboat together that they used during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high times and low , " Robert said , for the second time that morning , laughing and looking around the table at the faces of the others . Photograph <p> It was Sunday morning , and they were sitting around the table in Nick and Joanne 's kitchen in Aberdeen , eating smoked salmon , scrambled eggs , and cream cheese on bagels . It was salmon that Nick had caught the summer before and then had arranged to have vacuum packed . He 'd put the salmon in the freezer . He liked it that Joanne told Carol and Robert that he had caught the fish himself . She even knew-or claimed to know-how much the fish had weighed . " This fish weighed sixteen pounds , " she said , and Nick laughed , pleased . Nick had taken the fish out of the freezer the night before , after Carol had called and talked to Joanne and said she and Robert and their ten-year-old daughter , Jenny , would like to stop on their way through town , on their way to the ocean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We want to go skateboarding . " " The skateboards are in the car , " Jenny 's friend , Megan , said . " Take your plates over to the sink , " Robert said . " And then you can go skateboarding , I guess . But do n't go far . Stay in the neighborhood , " he said . " And be careful . " " Is it all right ? " Carol said . " Sure , it is , " Joanne said . " It 's fine . I wish I had a skateboard . If I did , I 'd join them . " " But mostly good times , " Robert said , going on with what he 'd been saying about their student days . " Right ? " he said , catching Joanne 's eye and grinning . Joanne nodded . " Those were the days , all right , " Carol said . Nick had the feeling that Joanne wanted to ask them something about Bill Daly . But she did n't . She smiled , held the smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like more coffee . " I 'll have some more , thanks , " Robert said . Carol said , " Nope " and put the palm of her hand over her cup . Nick shook his head . " So tell me about salmon fishing , " Robert said to Nick . " Nothing much to tell , " Nick said . " You get up early and you go out on the water , and if the wind is n't blowing and it does n't rain on you , and if the fish are in and you 're rigged up properly , you might get a strike . The odds are that , if you 're lucky , you 'll land one out of every four fish that hits . Some men devote their lives to it , I guess . I fish some in the summer months , and that 's it . " " Do you fish out of a boat or what ? " Robert said . He said this as if it was an afterthought . He was n't really interested , Nick felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd brought it up . " I have a boat , " Nick said . " It 's berthed down at the marina . " Robert nodded slowly . Joanne poured his coffee and Robert looked at her and grinned , as if glad for the interruption . " Thanks , babe , " he said . Nick and Joanne saw Carol and Robert every six months or so-more often than Nick would have liked , to tell the truth . It was n't that he disliked them ; he did like them . He liked them better , in fact , than any other of Joanne 's friends he 'd met . He liked Robert 's bitter sense of humor , and the way he had of telling a story , making it seem funnier , probably , than it really was . He liked Carol , too . She was a pretty , cheerful woman who still did an occasional acrylic painting-Nick and Joanne had hung one of her paintings , a gift , on their bedroom wall . Carol had never been anything but pleasant to Nick during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Robert and Joanne were reminiscing over the past , Nick would find himself looking across the room at Carol , who would hold his look , smile , and then give a little shake of her head , as if none of this talk of the past were of any consequence . Still , from time to time when they were in each other 's company , Nick could n't help feeling that an unspoken judgment was being made , and that Robert , if not Carol , still blamed him for breaking up Joanne 's marriage with Bill and ending their happy foursome . They saw each other in Aberdeen at least twice a year , once at the beginning of summer , and once again near summer 's end . Robert and Carol and Jenny made a loop through town on their way up the coast to the rain-forest country of the Olympic Peninsula , heading for a lodge they knew about near the ocean , and a place called Agate Beach , where Jenny would hunt for agates and fill up a leather pouch with stones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stayed overnight with Nick and Joanne-it occurred to Nick they 'd never been asked to stay , for one thing , though Nick was sure that Joanne would have been pleased enough to have them , if Nick had suggested it . But he had n't . On each of their visits , they arrived in time for breakfast , or else they showed up just before lunch . Carol always called ahead to make the arrangements . They were punctual , which Nick appreciated . Nick liked them , but somehow he was always made uneasy in their company , too . They 'd never , not once , talked about Bill Daly in Nick 's presence , or even so much as mentioned the man 's name . Nevertheless , when the four of them were together Nick was somehow made to feel that Daly was never very far from anyone 's thoughts . Nick had taken Daly 's wife away from him , and now these old friends of Daly 's were in the house of the man who 'd committed that callous indiscretion , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Was n't it a kind of betrayal of their old friend and loved one , Bill Daly , for Robert and Carol to be friends with the man who 'd done this ? To actually break bread in the man 's house and see him put his arm lovingly around the shoulders of the woman who used to be the wife of the man they loved ? " Do n't go far , honey , " Carol said to Jenny as the girls passed through the kitchen again . " We have to be leaving soon . " " We wo n't , " . Jenny said . " We 'll just skate out in front . " " See that you do , " Robert said . " We 'll go pretty soon , you kids . " He looked at his watch . The door closed behind the children , and the grownups went back to a subject they 'd touched on earlier that morning-terrorism . Robert was an art teacher in one of the Seattle high schools , and Carol worked in a boutique near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know anyone who was going to Europe or the Middle East that summer . In fact , several people , friends of theirs , had canceled their vacation plans to Italy and Greece . " See America first , is my motto , " Robert said . He went on to tell something about his mother and stepfather , who 'd just come back from two weeks in Rome . Their luggage had been lost for three days-that was the first thing that 'd happened . Then , the second night in Rome , walking down the Via Veneto to a restaurant not far from their hotel-the street was patrolled by men in uniform , carrying machine guns-his mother had had her purse snatched by a thief on a bicycle . Two days later , when they drove a rental car about thirty miles from Rome , somebody slashed a tire and stole the hood off the car while they were in a museum . " They did n't take the battery or anything , you understand , " Robert said . " They wanted the hood . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hood ? " Joanne asked . " Who knows ? " Robert said . " But , in any case , it 's getting worse for people over there-for tourists-since we bombed . What do you guys think about the bombing ? Did n't we overreact when we did that ? What the hell , I think it 's just going to make things worse for Americans . Everybody 's a target now . " Nick stirred his coffee and sipped it before saying , " I do n't know any longer . I really do n't . In my mind I keep seeing all those bodies lying in pools of blood in the airports . I just do n't know . " He stirred his coffee some more . " The guys I 've talked to over here think that we should have dropped a few more bombs , maybe , while we were at it . I heard somebody say they should have turned the place into a parking lot , while they were at it . I do n't know what we should or should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . " " Well , that 's a little severe , is n't it ? " Robert said . " A parking lot ? Like , nuke the place , you mean ? " " I said I do n't know what they should have done . But some kind of response was necessary . " " Diplomacy , " Robert said . " Economic sanctions . Let them feel it in their pocketbooks . Then they 'll straighten up and fly right . " " Should I make more coffee ? " Joanne said . " It wo n't take a minute . Who wants some cantaloupe ? " She moved her chair back and got up from the table . " I ca n't eat another bite , " Carol said . " Me neither , " Robert said . " I 'm fine . " He seemed to want to go on with what they were talking about , and then he stopped . " Nick , sometime I 'll come down here and go fishing with you . " " Do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come over and stay as long as you 'd like . " " When 's the best time to go ? " " July is the best month . But August is good too . Even the first week or two of September . " He started to say something about how swell it was fishing in the evenings , when most of the boats had gone in . He started to say something about the time he 'd hooked a big one in the moonlight . Robert seemed to consider for a minute . He drank some of his coffee . " I 'll do it . I 'll come this summer-in July , if that 's all right . " " It 's fine , " Nick said . " What will I need in the way of equipment ? " Robert said , interested . " Just bring yourself , " Nick said . " I have plenty of gear . " " You can use my rig , " Joanne said . " But then you could n't fish , " Robert said . And suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , Nick could see , the prospect of sitting together in a boat for hours on end made Robert and him both feel uneasy . No , frankly he could n't see any more for their relationship than sitting here in this nice kitchen twice a year , eating breakfast and lingering over coffee . It was pleasant enough , and it was just enough time spent together . It was just fine . More than this was just not in the cards . Lately he 'd even passed up an occasional trip to Seattle with Joanne , because he knew she 'd want to stop at the end of the day at Carol and Robert 's for coffee . Nick would make an excuse and stay home . He 'd say he was too busy at the lumberyard that he managed . On one occasion , Joanne had spent the night with Carol and Robert , and when she came home , she seemed to Nick to be remote and thoughtful for a few days . When he asked her about the visit , she said it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . Nick knew they must have talked about Bill Daly ; he was certain they had , and he found himself irritated for a few minutes . But what if they had talked about Daly ? Joanne was Nick 's now . Once he would have killed for her . He loved her still , and she loved him , but he did n't feel that obsessive now . No , he would n't kill for her now , and he had a hard time understanding how he 'd ever felt that way in the first place . He did n't think that she-or anybody , for that mattercould ever be worth killing somebody else for . Joanne stood up and began clearing the plates from the table . " Let me help , " Carol said . Nick put his arm around Joanne 's waist and squeezed her , as if vaguely ashamed of what he 'd been thinking . Joanne stood still , slightly bent over the table , and let him hold her . Then her face reddened slightly and she moved a little , and Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan , opened the door and rushed into the kitchen carrying their skateboards . " There 's a fire down the street , " Jenny said . " Somebody 's house is burning , " Megan said . " A fire ? " Carol said . " If it 's a real fire , stay away from it . " " I did n't hear any fire trucks , " Joanne said . " Did you guys hear fire trucks ? " " I did n't either , " Robert said . " You kids go play now . We do n't have much longer . " Nick stepped to the bay window and looked out , but nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening . The idea of a house fire on the block in clear , sunny weather at eleven in the morning was incomprehensible . Besides , there had been no alarms , no carloads of rubberneckers or clang of bells , or wail of sirens and hiss of air brakes . It seemed to Nick it had to be a part of a game the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carol said . " I loved it . I feel like I could roll over and go to sleep . " " Why do n't you do it ? " Joanne said . " We have that extra room upstairs . Let the kids play , and you guys take yourselves a nap before starting off . " " Go ahead , " Nick said . " Sure . " " Carol 's just kidding , of course , " Robert said . " We could n't do anything like that . Could we , Carol ? " Robert looked at her . " Oh , no , not really , " Carol said and laughed . " But everything was so good , as always . A champagne brunch without the champagne . " " The best kind , " Nick said . Nick had quit drinking six years ago after being arrested for driving while under the influence . He 'd gone with someone to an AA meeting , decided that was the place for him , and then went every night , sometimes twice in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink left him , as he put it , almost as if it 'd never been there . But even now , though he did n't drink , he still went to a meeting every once in a while . " Speaking of drinking , " Robert said . " Jo , do you remember Harry Schuster-Dr . Harry Schuster , a bone-marrowtransplant man now , do n't ask me how-but do you remember the Christmas party that time when he got into the fight with his then wife- ? " " Marilyn , " Joanne said . " Marilyn Schuster . I have n't thought of her in a long time . " " Marilyn , that 's right , " Robert said . " Because he thought she 'd had too much to drink and was making eyes at- " He paused long enough for Joanne to say , " Bill . " " Bill , that 's right , " Robert said . " Anyway , first they had words , and then she threw her car keys on the livingroom floor and said , You drive then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sober . " And so Harry-they 'd come in two cars , mind , he 'd been interning at the hospital-Harry went out and drove her car two blocks , parked it , and then came back for his car , and drove that about two blocks , parked , walked back to her car , drove it two blocks , walked to his own car and drove it a little farther , and parked and walked back to her car and drove that a few blocks , et cetera , et cetera . " They all laughed . Nick laughed , too . It was funny . Nick had heard plenty of drinking stories in his time , but he 'd never heard one that had this particular spin on it . " Anyway , " Robert said , " to make a long story short , as they say , he drove both cars home that way . It took him two or three hours to drive five miles . But he did it . And when he got to the house , there was Marilyn , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody had driven her home . Merry Christmas , " she said when Harry came in the door , and I guess he decked her . " Carol whistled . Joanne said , " Anybody could see those two were n't going to make it . They were in the fast lane . A year later they were both at the same Christmas party , I remember , only they had different partners by then . " " All the drinking and driving I did , " Nick said . He shook his head . " I was only picked up once . " " You were lucky , " Joanne said . " Somebody was lucky , " Robert said . " The other drivers on the road were lucky . " " I spent one night in jail , " Nick said , " and that was enough . That 's when I stopped . Actually , I was in what they call detox . The doctor came around the next morninghis name was Dr. Forester-and called each person into this little examining room and gave you the once-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made you hold out your hands , palms up , he took your pulse and listened to your heartbeat . He 'd give you a little talking-to about your drinking , and then he 'd tell you what time of the morning you could be released . He said I could leave at eleven o'clock . Doctor , " I said , could I leave earlier , please ? " What 's the big hurry ? " he said . " I have to be at church at eleven o'clock , " I said . I 'm getting married . " " " What 'd he say to that ? " Carol said . " He said , Get the hell out of here , mister . But do n't ever forget this , do you hear ? " And I did n't . I stopped drinking . I did n't even drink anything at the wedding reception that afternoon . Not a drop . That was it for me . I was too scared . Sometimes it takes something like that , a real shock to your nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid brother who was nearly killed by a drunk driver , " Robert said . " He 's still wired up and has to use a metal brace to get around . " " Last call for coffee , " Joanne said . " Just a little , I guess , " Carol said . " We really have to collect those kids and get on the road . " Nick looked toward the window and saw several cars pass by on the street outside . People hurried by on the sidewalk . He remembered what Jenny and the other child had said about a fire , but for God 's sake , if there were a fire there 'd be sirens and engines , right ? He started to get up from the table , and then he did n't . In a minute , he decided , he 'd go outside and look . " It 's crazy , " Nick said . " I remember when I was still drinking and I 'd just had what they call an alcoholic seizure-I 'd fallen and hit my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doctor 's office when it happened . I woke up in a bed in his office , and Peggy , the woman I was married to at the time , she was leaning over me , along with the doctor and the doctor 's nurse . Peggy was calling my name . I had this big bandage round my head-it was like a turban . The doctor said I 'd just had my first seizure , but it would n't be my last if I kept on drinking . I told him I 'd got the message . But I just said that . I had no intention of quitting then . I told myself and my wife that it was my nerves-stress-that had caused me to faint . " But that night we had a party , Peggy and me . It was something we 'd planned for a couple of weeks , and we did n't see how we could call it off at the last minute and disappoint everybody . Can you imagine ? So we went ahead and had the party , and everybody came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night I had a glass of vodka in my hand . I told people I 'd cut my head on the car door . " " How much longer did you keep drinking ? " Carol asked . " Quite a while . A year or so . Until I got picked up that night . " " He was sober when I met him , " Joanne said , and blushed , as if she 'd said something she should n't . Nick put his hand on Joanne 's neck and rested his fingers there . He picked up some of the hair that lay across her neck and rubbed it between his fingers and let it drop again . Some more people went by the window on the sidewalk . Most of the people were in shirtsleeves and blouses . A man was carrying a little girl on his shoulders . " I quit drinking about a year before I met Joanne , " Nick said , as if telling them something they needed to know . " Tell them about your brother , honey , " Joanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped rubbing Joanne 's neck and took his hand away . " What happened ? " Robert said , leaning forward . Nick shook his head . " What ? " Carol said . " Nick ? It 's okay-if you want to tell us , that is . " " How 'd we get onto this stuff , anyway ? " Nick said . " You brought it up , honey , " Joanne said . " Well , what happened , you see , was that I was trying to get sober , and I felt like I could n't do it at home , but I did n't want to have to go anyplace , like to a clinic or a recovery place , you know , and my brother had this summer house he was n't using-this was in October-and I called him and asked him if I could go there and stay for a week or two and try to get myself together again . At first he said yes . I began to pack a suitcase and I was thinking I was glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to help me . But pretty soon the phone rang , and it was my brother , and he said-he said he 'd talked it over with his wife , and he was sorry-he did n't know how to tell me this , he said-but his wife was afraid I might burn the place down . I might , he said , drop off with a cigarette burning in my fingers , or else leave a burner turned on . Anyway , they were afraid I would catch the house on fire , and he was sorry but he could n't let me stay . So I said okay , and I unpacked my suitcase . " " Wow , " Carol said . " Your own brother did that . He forsook you , " she said . " Your own brother . " " I do n't know what I 'd have done , if I 'd been in his shoes , " Nick said . " Sure you do , honey , " Joanne said . " Well , I guess I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stay there , what the hell . A house . What 's that ? You can get insurance on a house . " " That 's pretty amazing , all right , " Robert said . " So how do you and your brother get along these days ? " " We do n't , I 'm sorry to say . He asked me to lend him some money a while back , and I did , and he repaid me when he said he would . But we have n't seen each other in about five years . It 's been longer than that since I 've seen his wife . " " Where are all these people coming from ? " Joanne said . She got up from the table and went over to the window and moved the curtain . " The kids said something about a fire , " Nick said . " That 's silly . There ca n't be a fire , " Joanne said . " Can there ? " " Something 's going on , " Robert said . Nick went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then pulled up alongside the curb in front of the house and parked . Another car drove up and parked across the street . Small groups of people moved down the sidewalk past the house . Nick went out into the yard , and the others-Joanne , Carol , and Robert-followed him . Nick looked up the street and saw the smoke , a crowd of people , and two fire engines and a police car parked at the intersection . Men were training hoses on the shell of a housethe Carpenter house , Nick saw at a glance . Black smoke poured from the walls of the house , and flames shot from the roof . " My God , there 's a fire all right , " he said . " The kids were right . " " Why did n't we hear anything ? " Joanne said . " Did you hear anything ? I did n't hear anything . " " We 'd better go down and see about the girls , Robert , " Carol said . " They might get in the way somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen . " The four of them started down the sidewalk . They fell in with some other people who were walking at an unhurried pace . They walked along with these other people . Nick had the feeling that they could have been on an outing . But all the while , as they kept their eyes on the burning house , they saw firemen pouring water onto the roof of the house , where flames kept breaking through . Some other firemen were holding a hose and training a stream of water through a front window . A fireman wearing a helmet with straps , a long black coat , and black knee-high boots was carrying an ax and moving around toward the back of the house . They came up to where the crowd of people stood watching . The police car had parked sideways in the middle of the road , and they could hear the radio crackling inside the car , over the sound of the fire as it ripped through the walls of the house . Then Nick spotted the two girls , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " he said to Robert . " Over there . See them ? " They excused themselves and made their way through the crowd and came up beside the girls , who were holding their skateboards . " We told you , " Jenny said . " See ? The roof 's burning . " Megan stood holding her skateboard in one hand and had the thumb of her other hand planted in her mouth . " Do you know what happened ? " Nick said to the woman beside him . The woman was wearing a sun hat and smoking a cigarette . " Vandals , " she said . " That 's what somebody told me anyway . " " If they can catch them , they ought to kill them , or else lock them up and throw away the key , " said the man standing next to the woman . " These people are traveling in Mexico and do n't even know they wo n't have a house to live in when they come home . They have n't been able to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine ? They 're going to come home and find out they do n't have a house to live in any longer . " " It 's going ! " the fireman with the ax shouted . " Stand back ! Stand back . " Nobody was close to him or to the house . But the people in the crowd moved their feet or licked their lips , and Nick could feel himself grow tense . Someone in the crowd said , " Ah , my God . My God . " " Look at it , " someone else said . Nick edged closer to Joanne , who was staring intently at the fire . The hair on her forehead appeared damp . He put his arm around her . He realized , as he did it , that he 'd touched her this way at least three times that morning . Nick turned his head slightly in Robert 's direction and was surprised to see Robert staring at him instead of the house . Robert 's face was flushed , his expression stern , as if everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overturning of the established order-were Nick 's fault and could be laid on his doorstep . Nick stared back , his arm around Joanne , until the flush left Robert 's face , and Robert lowered his eyes . When he raised them again , he did n't look at Nick . He moved closer to his wife , as if to protect her . They all watched the firemen pour water onto the burning house . Nick and Joanne were still holding each other as they watched , but there was that familiar feeling Nick would have from time to time , as she absently patted his shoulder , that he did n't know what she was thinking . " What are you thinking ? " he asked her . " I was thinking about Bill , " she said . He went on holding her . She did n't say any more for a minute , and then she said , " I think about him every now and then , you know . After all , he was the first man I ever loved . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder and went on staring at the burning house .
