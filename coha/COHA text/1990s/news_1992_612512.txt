<p> New York - Democratic challenger Edmund G. " Jerry " Brown pulled a startling upset Tuesday as discontented voters in the Connecticut primary sent front-runner Bill Clinton a message : <p> It is n't over after all . <p> In a year when surprises have become ho-hum , Mr. Brown edged out the Arkansas governor in the small-state contest and forestalled a quick finish to the Democratic presidential nomination contest . <p> The effect was immediate - Mr. Clinton shed his front-runner garb and met Mr. Brown in a unscheduled debate in New York City on ABC 's " Nightline . " The chief argument was over who was the greatest Washington outsider and who was the phony . <p> Each was playing to the next big audience : the voters of New York , where the April 7 showdown had previously looked like a runaway for Mr. Clinton . <p> " It 's very simple . People want change . I 'm a vehicle for that , " Mr. Brown , a former governor of California , said prior to the " Nightline " debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets back to what Thomas Jefferson said : ' Stop the power of the few from rioting on the labors of the many . ' " <p> Before the impromptu debate , Mr. Clinton had responded to the loss by shifting his attention from President Bush to Mr. Brown , promising to come into New York with " guns blazing . " He canceled a Texas fund-raiser for a full day of appearances in New York today . <p> " Mr. Brown presented himself as the most anti-system candidate , " Mr. Clinton said . But the Arkansas governor said the Connecticut race was only a " real wake-up call for our folks in New York . . . . I do n't quit , I keep on fighting . " <p> Mr. Clinton signaled that he intended to focus on Mr. Brown 's " flat tax " proposal , which he said amounted to " war on New York " by denying New Yorkers the right to deduct their high local taxes from federal income taxes . <p> Mr. Brown signaled that he would continue to portray Mr. Clinton as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clinton spoke at a small steakhouse not far from Times Square . Mr. Brown celebrated his victory at a nearby union hall . <p> The Californian not only claimed the momentum but portrayed his low- budget , break-the-rules campaign as " a new , irresistible tide that is going to roll all the way to California . " <p> Mr. Brown 's home state holds the last major primary June 2 . He challenged Mr. Clinton to adopt his voluntary $ 100 limit on contributions and to eschew further television advertising in the New York battle . Mr. Clinton declined . <p> The Clinton-Brown confrontation in Connecticut sprang up last week with the withdrawal from the race of former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas . But even Mr. Tsongas , who did not campaign in Connecticut , gathered enough ballots from discontented voters to win a handful of the 53 delegates at stake . <p> As expected , President Bush easily clinched his 17th primary victory over conservative columnist Pat Buchanan , who has conceded the president 's renomination . No Republican candidate campaigned in the state , although Mr. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bush grew up in Connecticut , and his father represented the state in the U.S. Senate . But he has recommended cutbacks in submarine production that directly affect thousands of jobs in the state . <p> " We won an impressive victory today from people who understand that being president of the United States sometimes means making difficult decisions , " Mr. Bush declared . <p> Disgust with politics , disappointment with the Democratic presidential candidates and a dire view of the economy all figured in Mr. Brown 's impressive showing Tuesday in Connecticut , exit polls showed . <p> Among Democratic voters , 71 percent said they agree with the Californian 's criticisms of the political system , according to ABC and Cable News Network . <p> Only about half the Democrats said they are satisfied that Mr. Clinton has the honesty and integrity to serve effectively as president , according to a survey sponsored by the four major television networks . <p> A majority of those with doubts about Mr. Clinton voted for Mr. Brown , CNN said . Just 41 percent of all Democratic voters said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite Mr. Bush 's Republican victory , the networks said two in every five voters in his own party disapprove of his job performance . These voters split 44 percent for Mr. Buchanan , 30 percent for the uncommitted slate of delegates and 24 percent for Mr. Bush , CNN said . <p> The network cited another figure in the exit polls that could cause Mr. Bush trouble in the Nov. 3 election . He won 68 percent of voters in the GOP primary who call themselves Republicans , but only 37 percent of those who call themselves independents . <p> One week ago , after Mr. Clinton swept the Illinois and Michigan primaries , the Connecticut race was supposed to be a contest between Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton . <p> " One of the things that really threw me off my stride last week , when Senator Tsongas withdrew , was I thought , ' Oh , my gosh , everybody will say that I am going to win the nomination . And 80 percent of the voters in Connecticut will vote against me just to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <p> Mr. Brown , smelling blood , stumped the state intensely and drew large crowds . <p> " This thing is coming unraveled , " he told reporters Monday night after he attracted a 2,000-strong crowd that he stirred with an electric speech at the University of Connecticut . <p> Mr. Brown appeared to have been aided by a low voter turnout , as the Clinton campaign had feared . <p> According to television network polls , Mr. Tsongas would have won the state if he had stayed in the contest . <p> " If the Democrats have any sense they 'll realize the candidate 's out , but the message lives on , " Mr. Tsongas said from his home in Lowell , Mass . " They have to move toward that message . " <p> Connecticut , whose economy has been among the hardest-hit by the recession , was n't the type of playing field on which Mr. Clinton has prospered during the primary season . <p> Blacks , from whom Mr. Clinton has gotten roughly 75 percent of the vote in most primaries , make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is dominated by the type of middle-class suburbs in which he has not run well . <p> Despite the loss , Mr. Clinton survives the day with a huge delegate lead , approaching the halfway mark toward the 2,145 needed for nomination . Before Tuesday , Mr. Clinton had won 13 states to Mr. Brown 's three , and he had seven times as many delegates as his sole remaining major challenger . <p> In the delegate count , Mr. Tsongas remains second . By suspending his campaign rather than quitting outright , he retains control of his delegates . <p> Tsongas supporters , calling themselves " Tcitizen Tsoldiers for Tsongas , " had waged a die-hard campaign in Connecticut , urging voters not to abandon the former candidate . <p> Connecticut also was a state conducive to Mr. Brown 's television advertising , in which he blasted Congress for its check-writing scandal and hurled anti-incumbent rhetoric at Mr. Clinton . There is widespread voter anger in the state because of imposition of a new income tax and a continuing state budget crisis . <p> Although he is running as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democratic establishment in the state . His promise to save the Seawolf nuclear submarine , which is built in Groton and worth 17,000 jobs to the state , was criticized by both Mr. Brown and Mr. Bush as traditional political pandering . <p> Our news services contributed to this article .
