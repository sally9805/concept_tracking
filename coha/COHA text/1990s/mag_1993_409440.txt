All-terrain vehicles climb up and down in popularity , but still have many muddy multipurpose uses they do mighty well . They used to be the rage 25 years ago  --  those terrain-crawling multi-tired vehicles that someone back then dubbed the GAVs ( go-anywhere vehicles ) . Hunters and fishermen were especially intrigued in the 1950s and ' ' 60s when four-wheel-drive capability was limited to surplus military jeeps and a smattering of new offerings from Detroit  --  like the early Ford Bronco , Chevy Blazer , civilian versions of the jeep and a few pickup trucks in 4X4 . Nothing like today 's lineup of sport-utility vehicles ( SUVs ) was even envisioned then . Yet outdoorsmen needed rigs capable of taking them and their gear deep into the woods or high into the mountains . Pack horses and slogging one foot in front of the other weighed down by a backpack were the time-honored alternatives . They still are for the purists among us , particularly in areas deserving special ecological protection . Today 's backcountry drivers know that sticking to established trails and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport . Now there are dozens of off-road auto choices , plus little flotation-tire vehicles . So what of those " GAVs ? " By the late 1960s , more than a dozen small manufacturers were turning out things called " Coot " and " Terra Tiger . " Most of these models are gone today . Even the " PUG , " perhaps the most unique among them , ceased production in 1975 . Yet like the PUG , some have returned to find their own niche  --  usually in the place where rugged terrain precludes using conventional pickups or SUVs. , Often these vehicles go where heavy loads of people , gear or supplies must be ferried into the outback with a minimum of fuss or environmental impact . Saskatchewan 's North Country is one example . On a recent black bear hunt there with Brian Hoffart of Bait Masters Hunting Camps , I saw two such vehicles in action daily . Hoffart runs eight to 10 baits for spring and fall bear hunters ( mostly for muzzleloaders and bowhunters )  --  a task that requires constant replenishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by local fishing lodges to meat leftovers . The 50-gallon barrels he uses are heavy . There is also much hauling involved with the two or three hunters he may place out on tree stands in one run each afternoon and return to pick up each evening after dark . Because permanent tree stands are eschewed by Hoffart , he must haul hunters , gear , portable tree stands and steps and other equipment each day . Stands are hunted only a few times each season , so there is constant moving of equipment from place to place . Stands that go in with the hunter often come out with him and are placed elsewhere the next day . Of course , the bait sites must be cleaned up completely when Hoffart is through using them . ( Incidentally , Hoffart 's clients normally see 15 to 30 bears of both black and cinnamon-color phases during the average week 's hunt . Boars qualifying for Pope and Young Club minimums are not uncommon . In 1992 , he charged $1,200 for a week 's hunt , including housing , meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information , contact Hoffart at Bait Masters , Box 99 , Green Lake , Saskachtewan , Canada SOM 1B0 ; 306-832-2084 . So what does Hoffart favor for transport ? " I 'm on my third or fourth Argo , " he said , noting that the Canadian-made all-terrain vehicle ( ATV ) in its maximum 8X8 configuration ( four wheels on each side ) still works best in swampy situations . Saskatchewan 's North Country seems to have more bog land than dry grounds or lakes . " The Argo is supposed to be amphibious , and it truly is under most conditions , " Hoffart said . The vehicle 's design creates low ground pressure , enabling it to " float " over lots of obstacles  --  and float where necessary in shallow water crossings . In the early 1960s , Argo 's maker , Ontario Drive &; Gear Ltd. , located near Kitchener , had been making transmissions for the " Amphicat , " another ATV manufactured near Toronto . Ontario Drive launched its own version , the Argo , in 1967 with a new design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the driver put in the middle for balance . Cargo space was moved rearward . Argos , then and now , featured a full-frame , roller-chain drive , a two-speed forward transmission with planetary differential and disc brake skid steering . The power plant , a Kohler two-cycle 399cc engine , was replaced by an 18-hp Kohler Magnum two-cylinder , four-cycle engine in 1981 with electronic ignition and forced air cooling ( the 6X6 model has a Briggs &; Stratton overhead valve V-twin four-cycle engine ) . Over land , the top-rated speed is 18 mph , though in water the eight tires achieve a sluggish 2 mph . But it gets you there . Land load capacity is about 1,000 pounds , slightly less in water . The transmission today has two forward speeds , plus neutral and reverse , though the steering is the same : two hand-operated levers to activate brakes that turn or stop the vehicle . At the right hand is a twist-grip throttle , and there 's a dash-mounted choke control . The frame is steel , and the body is made of high-density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both the eight and six-wheel models . Options include tracks over the wheels , roll bars , electric winch and hoist and various convertible tops and windshield arrangements . Hoffart 's real love affair today , however , is with his new PUG , a reincarnation of the PUGs designed and built by Bill Figura in his garage in the 1960s . Bruce Manufacturing , Figura 's company , made PUGS  --  the only fully articulated ATV available  --  from ' ' 67 to ' ' 75 , when the manufacturer converted exclusively to the golf course market . Bill Iverson , Bruce 's sale manager in the ' ' 60s and ' ' 70s , felt PUG still had potential . He bought the manufacturing rights , did some redesigning and improving of the original model and began manufacturing PUGs at a plant in Turtle Lake , Wisconsin . Hoffart believes that the PUG is superior to most other ATVs when it comes to heavy-duty hauling . " I drove all the way to Wisconsin to pick up my first one , " he said , " and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Oh , there are some design changes I 'd like to see  --  like the exhaust relocated upward so that it does n't foul so easily . But PUG has mostly proved very good for what I need to accomplish . " The unique feature of the PUG is that it uses the same kind of automotive drive train as found in the Ford Escort . No free-wheeling , variable speed clutches or belts here , but rather an automotive clutch and four-speed syncromesh transmission that power two automotive drive shafts in the 4X4 version  --  or just the front one in the two-wheel edition . Industrial grade Spicer differentials are used front and rear in the 4X4 . Engine choice is Kohler 's V2 20-hp air-cooled industrial power plant with full-pressure lubrication . An automotive-type , four-speed manual transmission is utilized . Top speed in high gear is 23 mph , while the turning radius is 16.2 feet with automotive-type power steering . Ground clearance is 7.5 inches . Brakes are foot-activated with drums on all four wheels . Of course , like the Argo-types , no special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absorb all of the shock , which they do n't , naturally . But ATVs are made for ruggedness , not abject comfort . The PUG will carry 1,500 pounds in its rear box  --  not counting the driver and passenger up front ( which has nicely padded seats ) . The company rates the PUG at 1,500 pounds on each axle . PUG 's towing peak is an impressive 3,000 pounds , which provides a lot of pulling strength . Molded fiberglass forms the body ( and Hoffart added brush guards over the headlamps and tubular fenders around the body to protect it from the inevitable collisions with trees and rocks ) . PUG comes in red or camouflage . Slip out three steel pins , and body accessories can be changed from the six-passenger personnel carrier to the all-steel dump-bed gravel box ( optional dump mechanism is available ) or to a flatbed with stake pockets . An optional hydraulic package up front allows snow blade use , and there 's an all-weather cab enclosure , a fifth wheel attachment and insecticide and pesticide spray packages with tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoffart felt that he had a better design for a flatbed to move heavy gear and bait barrels , so he broke out the welding torches . To say it works slickly is an understatement . Of course , that still leaves room for the more conventional ATVs . Yamaha , Polaris , Suzuki , Kawasaki and Honda all make larger versions of their popular four-wheel ATVs , all capable of carrying and/or towing heavier loads  --  although nothing like the PUG . An amphibious ATV from Recreatives Industries in Buffalo , New York , the Max is a six-wheel-drive rig . It comes in both two and four-passenger models . Polaris ' Big Boss 4X6 and 6X6 provide some 75 pounds of cargo capacity on the front carrier in front of the wheels , plus either 650 or 850 pounds of cargo-weight-carrying capability in the rear cargo box or flatbed alternative . With it you get on-demand six-wheel traction in 4X4 operation with an automatic PVT transmission , a 244cc fan-assisted , air-cooled engine , electric start , single-lever braking and a 156-inch turning capacity . Models like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry lots of gear into places where the width between obstacles might stop units like Argo or PUG . Accessories refine the equipment for Polaris . Big Boss has a wooden stake side kit , as well as an optional nylon box canopy to protect gear from the elements . There are grading blade packages , snow plows , padded and molded gun scabbards and even an optional electric power lift for Big Boss . Honda 's biggest 4X4 is the Four-trax 300 , which provides lots of towing power with the 282cc single-cylinder four-stroke engine . There 's a five-speed transmission with reverse and a super-flow first gear for pulling anything connected to the trailer hitch . Hunters can get it in olive , too , to blend with the background afield . Suzuki does n't give you a drab paint job , but it does provide an accessory camouflage cover for 4WD and King Quad models  --  both large and rugged and of interest to sportsmen who have to haul a load . Both front and rear racks offer cargo capacity , and trailering is possible with the hitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-terrain vehicles , or for heavier duty chores , the Kawasaki Mule utility vehicles . This coming year , Yamaha will provide nine ATV models . Most powerful is a new Kodiak four-wheel-drive with a 387cc four-stroke engine and both electric and recoil starters . Other units will cover heavy-duty high-performance sport and youth-machine markets . The four-wheel-drive ATVs can be viewed at a wide network of local dealers nationwide . All of these ATV types reach the zenith of their usefulness around hunting and fishing camps . I do n't know too many commercial lodges or outfitters who do n't have one or more of them . It just makes good business sense . Individual outdoorsmen might take a closer look too . Even the bigger units , like Argo , can be fitted into the beds of full-size pickup trucks . Ditto for PUG . Hoffart has a flatbed trailer he pulls behind his old Dodge pickup ( refitted for propane gas to save operational expense ) that is custom-crafted for the PUG . With Argo in the pickup bed and the PUG towed behind the 4x4 Dodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his customers . <p>
