<p> LIKE Muhammad Ali in his boxing prime , financial wagers on the Year 2000 problem can float like a butterfly , sting like a bee . Just ask futures traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . <p> They began betting last fall that the final days of 1999 would bring worldwide panic about potential Year 2000 computer glitches . They speculated that nervous people and businesses would hoard cash , putting a severe strain on banks and driving up borrowing costs for anyone needing credit . <p> By the end of the year , the traders had driven December 1999 futures prices to levels that , in effect , projected a devastating jump of about 13 percentage points in dollar interest rates at the end of this year . They did it with trades known as " butterflies " that usually look a bit like the insects when their components are charted . By December , the charts for the " millennium butterfly "  --  the purchase of a September 1999 contract , the sale of two December 1999 's and the purchase of a March 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The trading was greeted as an overdue guest by Year 2000 alarmists , who had been longing for evidence to support their predictions that Y2K , as the computer problem has been nicknamed , would make huge waves in the markets . It also grabbed much attention in banking circles . " We are all looking for road signs as to what will happen , " a Year 2000 project manager at a major New York bank confided at the time . <p> The road sign has since been flattened , though , along with those who were certain it pointed somewhere . By last month , December futures prices had tumbled back into their traditional relationship with the September and March contracts . Participants were left wondering what to make of it all . <p> " I think it was a bubble rather than anything substantive , " said Galen Burghardt , a senior vice president at Carr Futures , a brokerage firm based in Chicago . " If you really got a sense people could n't bank at year-end , all hell would break loose . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing sentiment that it does not pay  --  so far , at least  --  to bet that Year 2000 problems will produce any sharp moves in stocks , bonds and other mainstream markets . Some managers say it is a mistake to think that bets on Y2K will ever be rewarded . <p> " By definition , the stock market only moves on surprises , since today 's prices reflect expectations , " said Kenneth L. Fisher of Fisher Investments in Woodside , Calif. , which manages $2.9 billion for institutions and private clients . " Y2K is no surprise . " <p> GIVE Mr. Fisher a gold medal in the Understatement Olympics . It would be a feat these days to find an investor who has never heard that the decades-old practice of using two digits in computer dates , like " 99 " for 1999 , could trip up computers , programs and electronically controlled machines reading year 2000 dates . The " 00 " might be read as 1900 or not recognized as a valid date ; some malfunctions lead to shutdowns and others to faulty calculations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as confident as Mr. Fisher that the market has anticipated Y2K : Everyone may know that Y2K is coming , but there is great uncertainty over how extensive disruptions will be , where they will strike and when their impacts will be felt by individual companies and nations . Prices may plunge where disruptions hit or skyrocket where they do not . <p> Well before Jan. 1 , some analysts say , the prospect of volatility could force trillions of dollars in investment portfolios to be rearranged as managers try to reduce their risks . If that happens , those who move before the crowd will , as always , pay less to achieve their goals . So even skeptics must be poised to jump . <p> " It 's a puzzle to me , " said Jonathan Muehl , a pension fund adviser at Buck Consultants in Pittsburgh , who sees no sign yet of Y2K hedging activity in options prices . ( An option is the right to buy or sell a commodity , a stock or an entire basket of stocks for a specific price at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to complete such a deal . ) <p> Mr. Muehl says options that would protect investors from sharp stock-portfolio declines in the trading days before 2000 currently sell at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and in over-the-counter trading at prices that imply almost no increase in the risk that stocks will gyrate later this year . <p> " It could be that the market is n't concerned , but part of me wonders whether the market has really focused on the issue yet , " Mr. Muehl said . <p> The prevailing wisdom  --  reflected in a report this month from a United States Senate special committee tracking Y2K as well as recent analyses by leading Wall Street brokerage firms  --  is that overseas markets are especially vulnerable to Y2K problems . Most countries started dealing with Y2K later than the United States , and many developing nations are hard pressed for resources . <p> Just last month , the Global 2000 Coordinating Group , an international organization of more than 230 banks , insurance companies and other financial institutions , dropped plans to publicly rate the readiness of 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ignite a disruptive flight of capital . But lagging nations  --  and the businesses within them  --  may have received only a temporary reprieve . <p> " It is probably too early for Y2K factors to dominate an investment decision , " said George A. Murnaghan , executive vice president and marketing manager at Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore , which manages $30 billion for mutual funds and institutions with international portfolios . " As the year goes on , it will become more important . " <p> To be sure , there has already been plenty of action involving the stocks of companies like Viasoft Inc. and Data Dimensions that have been beneficiaries of the billions being spent to repair Y2K defects . <p> Starting in 1996 , such stocks soared  --  and often later crashed  --  as investors placed bets on how big the repair effort would be and which companies would profit most . Now all those players are treating Y2K as history as they race to convince Wall Street that they have viable strategies to prosper when the Year 2000 work dries up . <p> BUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Y2K or on how individuals and business will act in the final run up to it . Other than the butterfly , which involved contracts so large that only large institutional investors and professional traders at the Merc waded in , the only hot Year 2000 investment action to date has been in market niches like gold and silver coins , where small investors are chasing limited supplies . <p> The coins are being snapped up not only as investments but also because many alarmists see them as valuable assets for barter if the Year 2000 banking collapse they foresee comes to pass . Demand was so strong for 1998 Silver Eagles that the United States Mint ran out in early December ; the 1999 version is already in short supply . <p> " The shortages are just driving demand higher , " said David Harper , editor of Numismatic News , a weekly newspaper for coin collectors , based in Iola , Wis . He said many dealer quotes for the coins have been running at more than triple the once-common $1.25 premium to spot silver prices . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a crash in the coin markets if , as most experts predict , Y2K disruptions turn out to be minor in the United States . Prices may also dive if the Mint sharply increases its output this year , he said . <p> The coin markets are being stoked by feverish talk on the Internet of inevitable catastrophe come the millennium . More respected voices  --  like Edward Yardeni , the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities , who gained a following on Wall Street for correctly forecasting the market boom of the 90 's  --  couch their warnings in terms of probabilities . Mr. Yardeni currently says there is a 70 percent chance that Y2K breakdowns will usher in a global recession and that the most likely impact on the stock market is a 30 percent to 40 percent decline . <p> Investors who bother to look up Mr. Yardeni 's full analysis , however , might sit tight . He expects a major rebound in 2001 and sees the Dow Jones industrial average , currently at 9,876.35 , reaching 15,000 by 2005 . Of course , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , there are huge profits to be made by selling now and buying just after prices tumble . <p> " The market is currently priced for perfection , and that just wo n't happen , " said Dennis G. Grabow , chief executive of the Millennium Investment Corporation , a Chicago-based investment adviser to pension funds with $20 billion in assets . <p> Mr. Grabow advocates dumping investments in emerging markets , urban real estate and the chemical industry , among others , in favor of Government bonds . He expects a " flight to quality " to drive up demand for such bonds , creating profits for those who hold them . Investors , he said , can easily move their money back into stocks once markets have absorbed a Y2K hit . <p> The market is not accurately anticipating Y2K , Mr. Grabow argued , because analysts are talking to their usual sources , like corporate financial officers , instead of those lower down the ranks who are managing repair work and testing . <p> But Mr. Grabow 's view has been , at best , premature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down 25 percent last year ; in fact , the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index rose 26.7 percent . Small investors who saw Tony Keyes on Oprah Winfrey 's television program last year and snapped up his book , " The Year 2000 Computer Crisis : An Investor 's Survival Guide " ( Y2K Investor , 1997 ) , may also have turned defensive too soon . <p> " I 've left a lot of money on the table , " conceded Mr. Keyes , a former computer systems analyst turned Washington talk-radio host . <p> He outlines many investment choices in his book but chose a defensive posture emphasizing Government bonds for himself . Though he largely missed the latest leg of the bull market in stocks , he added , the upside is that he has been sleeping well . <p> Such experiences underscore the exquisite timing skills that Y2K financial bets require  --  exactly the kind of market timing that many Wall Street professionals and financial advisers tell investors to avoid . Not only are there varying theories of when disruptions might strike  --  it could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American businesses  --  but it is also difficult to predict when investors might start reacting . <p> Mr. Fisher , the California money manager , is fond of calling stock markets " The Great Humiliator . " <p> He said he could easily envision a " relatively normal correction " this year in a market that has reached record prices . Such a correction , he said , could become exaggerated if " Y2K people come screaming out of the woodwork . " Investors trying to time the market , he added , could be lured into foolish selling . <p> Others warn that even in the event of a New Year 's debacle , the reactions in financial markets might not all be so obvious as a race into Government bonds . Y2K problems might not send markets tumbling in Asia , for example ; so much money has already been pulled out of troubled stock markets there that major investors might simply delay reinvestment instead of selling more . <p> Or how about this twist : Big companies with no Year 2000 problems might face selling pressure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to build up cash to buy stocks they regard as unfairly beaten down . That picture seems plausible to the chief strategist of one of the country 's biggest pension funds . <p> " We 're long-term investors , but we 're also opportunistic , " he explained , speaking on the condition of anonymity . <p> OF course , while institutions may have a variety of deft strategies for jumping on opportunities , history suggests that many will end up outwitting themselves if Year 2000 trouble develops . In every recent downturn , the big institutions have done the bulk of the misguided panic selling and small investors a large proportion of the timely buying . <p> One could easily imagine Y2K producing a similar result . Many of the most skittish small investors are already out of the market and into coins or other defensive investments . If trouble hits , they will not be around for the panic selling . <p> Instead , those left may well be mostly long-term investors perfectly willing to snap up any bargains the institutions create in their race to the exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 2000 computer problem has popped up in the pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , where 90-day Eurodollar futures are traded by institutions trying to protect themselves from swings in interest rates . <p> Normally , the further away the period covered by a 90-day Eurodollar futures contract , the higher the projected interest rate , just as a loan due further in the future will usually carry a higher rate because of the added risk . In other words , today , a June futures contract  --  which embodies the market 's guess at what interest rates will be from mid-June to mid-September  --  would be priced to reflect a lower rate than a September contract , which projects rates from mid-September through mid-December . <p> One common exception to the price patterns occurs because banks often need extra cash near year-end , especially over the New Year 's holiday , when the Federal Reserve is closed . Speculating that the supply of money will be tight enough to force up interest rates temporarily , traders take a " butterfly " position across the September , December and March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon usually shows what looks like gently angled " wings " from the September and March contracts to the December " body " between them . That implies a modest interest-rate increase the last day of the year . A typical trading pattern was seen last Nov. 13 , shown in Chart 1 . <p> However , late last year , Year 2000 fever drove implied interest rates way up for December 1999 futures , giving the butterfly sharply angled wings . At its peak on Dec. 28 , the contract price indicated that traders expected a rate jump that was far larger than normal at the end of 1999 , as shown in Chart 2 . <p> By late February , the patterns were closer to normal . Since then , the trend has edged toward slightly more nervousness . But volume has dropped sharply , indicating that many traders have decided that the butterfly spread this year is too unpredictable to trade . Chart 3 shows the current picture . <p> How is the year-end butterfly turned into a calculation of projected interest rates ? The difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of it , September and March , is seen by banks as a starting point for estimating by how much market interest rates in the London currency market , where the Eurodollars are traded , will exceed the Federal Reserve overnight bank lending rate over the New Year 's holiday . <p> Because the three-day New Year 's weekend beginning Dec. 31 , 1999 , is one-thirtieth of the 90-day contract period , bankers simply multiply the difference by 30 to come up with a number that roughly approximates how much the market expects interest rates to jump at the end of the year . <p> As Chart 3 shows , traders still expect rates to climb , but not nearly to the extent that they did in December . BARNABY J. FEDER <p> http : //www.nytimes.com <p> Graphs : The three seperate graphs show the changing pattern of how much the market experts was expecting interest rates to jump , since Nov. 13,1998 . As chart 3 shows , traders still expect a jump , but not as much as they did in December . ( Carr @ @ @ @ @ @ @
