Pluto . No spacecraft has ever flown past it , no instruments have ever sampled its atmosphere , no cameras have ever ventured near its forbidding surface . More than three billion kilometers away , Pluto patrols the outer reaches of the solar system , guards its secrets well , and challenges us to explore it . JOURNEYS TO THE EDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM In 1989 , the voyager 2 spacecraft sped past two other distant worlds , Neptune and its big moon Triton . Voyager discovered an Earth-sized dark spot on Neptune and erupting geysers on Triton , but the visit was brief , and Voyager is now heading out of the solar system , never to return . All three worlds  --  Neptune , Triton , and Pluto  --  figure prominent in plans for bold new missions to the outer solar system . They are missions of daring and imagination , missions that will send a spacecraft past Pluto in 2015 and an orbiter to study Neptune and Triton around 2021 . Of the three principal targets for such flights , Neptune is by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small , rocky planets of the inner solar system . It is a giant world , like Jupiter , Saturn , and Uranus . But these four planets differ greatly among themselves . For one thing , Jupiter and Saturn contain much more mass than Uranus and Neptune . Jupiter 's mass is 318 Earth 's and Saturn 's is 95 Earth 's , but Uranus and Neptune have masses of only 14.5 and 17.2 Earth 's . All four giant planets have hydrogen-helium atmosphere is so thick that it constitutes most of each planet 's mass . For Uranus and Neptune , the reverse is true : the core of water and rock outweighs the hydrogen helium atmosphere enveloping it . Thus , Uranus and Neptune are fundamentally different from Jupiter and Saturn . The differences among the four big planets will be a crucial target of inquiry for several spacecrafts . Jupiter and Saturn will be the first to greet the next visitors to the outer solar system . In 1995 , the Galileo spacecraft will reach orbit around Jupiter and send a probe into Jupiter 's thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturn and hurl a probe into the atmosphere or that planet 's large moon Titan . Both Jupiter and Saturn have already received flybys from spacecraft , but orbiters such as Galileo and Cassini will yield far more data , since they can examine their targets for years . Such detailed studies promise exciting revelations . But because the masses and structures of Jupiter and Saturn differ so much from those of Uranus and Neptune , we will not be able to infer much about these planes from Galileo and Cassini . Uranus and Neptune also distinguish themselves from their big brothers in other ways . First , the two planets look different . Methane gas on Uranus and Neptune absorbs red light to varying degrees , coloring Uranus green and Neptune blue . Moreover , Uranus is bland , whereas Neptune has a lively atmosphere . In 1989 , Voyager 2 discovered Neptune 's Great Dark Spot , an Earth-sized feature that resembles Jupiter 's even larger Great Red Spot . Scientists would like to study Neptune 's atmosphere for years rather than days , the way Voyager did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure . Orbiting Neptune are four rings and eight satellites . The king of the satellites is Triton , but the seven smaller moons are also of interest , for Voyager did not study them up close . Take , for example , the second largest satellite , Proteus , which Voyager itself discovered . Proteus measures only 400 km across but bears a crater 150 km wide . Also intriguing is Neptune 's third largest moon , Nereid , which American astronomer Gerard Kuiper discovered in 1949 . Nereid follows an elongated orbit around Neptune . When nearest the planet , Nereid lies 1.4 million km from Neptune , but when farthest Nereid ventures 9.7 million km from its master . Unfortunately , Nereid lay far from Voyager 2 when the spacecraft passed it , and the best Voyager image shows Nereid as only a fuzzy crescent . By far the most intriguing satellite , though , is Triton . With a diameter of 2,700 km , Triton is Neptune 's largest moon . It is also one of the largest moons in the solar system , ranking seventh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Sun and has a temperature of just 38 kelvins , the coldest ever measured in the solar system . For comparison , Neptune is 59 kelvins . When Voyager few by in 1989 , it discovered that over 99 percent of Triton 's tenuous atmosphere is nitrogen , the same gas that makes up most of the atmospheres of Earth and Saturn 's moon Titan . Voyager 2 also found a huge polar cap on Triton composed or nitrogen and methane ice and what appear to be geysers shooting nitrogen gas 8 km high into the atmosphere . Other areas of Triton contain volcanoes . Though probably no longer active , these volcanoes may have flooded Triton billions of years ago , not with lava , but with liquid water that buried most of Triton 's craters . As a consequence , Triton is one of the new moons in the solar system that is not heavily cratered . Such intense volcanism tells scientists that Triton has led a rough life . Triton has suffered because it did not form with Neptune but was instead captured by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opposite the direction that Neptune spins . Triton is the only large moon in the solar system to circle its planet backward . After Triton was captured , its orbit around Neptune was elliptical , like Nereid 's present orbit . But friction with Neptune 's atmosphere and the tides raised on Triton by Neptune reduced the ellipticity of the orbit so that today the satellite 's orbit is a circle . This circularization exacted a huge price from Triton , however , for Triton 's interior heated so much  --  by transfer of kinetic energy to heat  --  that it completely melted . Volcanoes spewed water out of the satellite 's interior , eradicating Triton 's craters . These volcanoes may also have erupted the nitrogen and methane ice that now lie over the satellite 's crust , which itself is made of water ice . Several objects like Triton may have clumped together long ago to form the planet Triton now orbits . When the solar system was young , Triton-like objects and small , icy comets collided with one another to form Uranus and Neptune . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar system and provides insight into the origin of the outermost planets . Unfortunately , because of the trauma it suffered following its capture by Neptune , Triton no longer resembles its original self . What we now see on its surface may be as much a product of Triton 's unique history as of its birth . THE PLANET DOUBLE Fortunately , there is also Pluto . In all ways but one , Pluto appears to be just like Triton . Pluto is the same size ( 2,300 km across or Pluto , 2,700 km for Triton ) , the same density ( 2.03 grams per cubic centimeter or Pluto , 2.07 grams per cubic centimeter for Triton ) , and therefore probably has the same composition . Like Triton , Pluto harbors methane ice on its surface and is surrounded by a tenuous atmosphere . As Triton once did , Pluto orbits the Sun independent of Neptune . The big difference , though , is that Pluto never got caught by Neptune , so Pluto escaped the geological changes that Triton suffered . Both Pluto and Triton are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . But unlike Triton , Pluto may preserve a record of the solar system 's origin 4.6 billion years ago . What is a big reason scientists want to see Pluto . The best reason to send a spacecraft to Pluto , though , is that no one ever has . A mission to Pluto would show us or the first time what Pluto is like , revealing what substances lie on its surface and what gases constitute its atmosphere . It would also scrutinize Pluto 's odd moon , Charon , discovered in 1978 . Even less is known about Charon than Pluto . Charon measures about 1,200 km across , a little over half the diameter of Pluto itself . For comparison , Triton is just one-eighteenth the diameter of Neptune . Charon is so big relative to Pluto that many scientists call Pluto and Charon a double planet . Mysterious though it is , Charon has shown that Pluto resembles Triton . In 1978 , Charon 's slow orbital motion around Pluto revealed that Pluto 's mass is tiny , far less than that of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed eclipses as Pluto and Charon passed in front of and behind each other . These eclipses revealed Pluto 's diameter . The two pieces of data  --  mass and diameter  --  yielded Pluto 's density , showing that Pluto is probably made of the same stuff as Triton . Although they have led radically different lives since birth , both Triton and Pluto hold key clues to the origin of the outermost planets . WHY NOW ? Neptune , Triton , and Pluto deserve spacecraft . They are objects or importance , worlds of mystery . To reach Neptune and Pluto fast , however , a spacecraft must first fly past Jupiter , whose great gravity can accelerate a craft to the edge of the solar system . Jupiter circles the Sun every 12 years and so is in the right place about once every 12 years . Therefore , launch opportunities to Neptune and Pluto recur at the same interval . The next launch windows open from 2001 to 2003 . I we miss them , we must wait more than a decade and launch in 2013 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neptune and Triton will not change greatly in 12 years , so they can wait . But Pluto can not . Pluto follows the strangest orbit of any planet , one that takes the world from just inside Neptune 's orbit to two billion kilometers beyond it . Right now , Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune is . In 1979 , Pluto equaled Neptune 's distance from the Sun , in 1989 it achieved its closest distance to the Sun , and in 1999 it will slip back beyond Neptune . Pluto is therefore receding from the Sun and getting colder . Astronomers calculate that by the 2020s Pluto will be so cold that its atmosphere will freeze onto the surface and remain frozen or nearly two centuries . A Pluto-bound craft launched in 2001 would reach Pluto in 2015 , before the atmosphere vanishes , but one launched in 2013 would get there at the end of the 2020s , too late to determine what gases make up Pluto 's atmosphere . Furthermore , not only will Pluto 's atmosphere soon disappear , but so will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pluto lies on its side as it rotates . During the 1980s , Pluto 's equator raced the Sun and all of Pluto and Charon received sunlight during a complete day . A spacecraft that flew past Pluto and Charon at that time would therefore have seen all of both worlds , since Pluto and Charon would have been fully illuminated for the spacecraft 's cameras . But Pluto is moving into a position such that one of its poles faces the Sun , leaving the other side in perpetual darkness . A spacecraft launched in 2001 would arrive soon enough to image most of Pluto and Charon , but a spacecraft launched in 2013 would reach Pluto and Charon too late to study much more than hall the surface of each . A similar situation actually prevailed in 1986 when Voyager 2 flew past Uranus . The pole of Uranus faced the Sun , so the spacecraft could photograph only half of Uranus because the other half was dark . In the case of Uranus , this was n't a big deal : Uranus is bland , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface is much more variable . Astronomers know this because Pluto 's brightness changes by nearly 30 percent every time the planet rotates . It would be unfortunate if the Pluto spacecraft traveled three billion kilometers and then missed seeing half the planet . CLOSE TO THE EDGE What will the journey to the far-of worlds of Neptune and Pluto be like ? Even the scientists and engineers most involved with the missions do n't know or sure . They have only just begun to formulate the light plans , so details may change . No funding has begun , nor need any be requested until the mid-1990s . So preliminary are these missions , in fact , that the Neptune-and Pluto-bound craft have not yet been named . To save money , the Neptune and Pluto spacecraft will be similar , even though their targets are not . Both spacecraft will probably be Mariner Mark 2s , a design to be used on the Cassini mission to Saturn . Both spacecraft will also have probes attached to them , just as Galileo and Cassini do . Mariner Neptune will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charon can be mapped at close range . Employing similar spacecraft and borrowing technology from Cassini will cut costs , but such an ambitious project will still be expensive . The total price tag for the Neptune-Pluto missions will likely be at lest a billion dollars . Funding must begin in fiscal year 1996 or 1997 . The Pluto mission will be launched first , in 2001 . That way , if the spacecraft fails , the second spacecraft , originally targeted for Neptune , can go to Pluto . If the first craft leaves Earth safely , however , the second will be launched toward Neptune in 2002 . The Pluto craft will reach its target first , in 2015 , and head out of the solar system . The Neptune craft will take longer and not achieve orbit around Neptune until 2021 . By the 21st century , Neptune will again be closer than Pluto , but a spacecraft that orbits a planet faces a tougher job than one that flies past its target  --  the orbiter must slow down to the point where it can enter an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take about 14 years to reach its goal , the Neptune orbiter will require 19 years to attain its . MARINER PLUTO Accordingly to the current scenario , the Pluto-bound spacecraft will leave Earth in late 2001 . It will be launched on a Titan 4/Centaur rocket , rather than by the shuttle the way Galileo was . The Mariner spacecraft will travel around the solar system and in 2005 re-encounter Earth , whose gravity will send the ship to Jupiter for an encounter in 2006 . Jupiter 's gravity will then catapult the craft to the edge of the solar system . Pluto is the real target . In mid 2014 , ten months prior to encounter , the Mariner spacecraft will begin observing the far-off world . As the craft approaches , it will discern details on the surfaces of Pluto and Charon . Three to four months before encounter , the Mariner spacecraft will fire its probe . This probe will help main spacecraft image all of Pluto . Pluto spins slowly , once every 6.4 days , so without a second craft , the speeding craft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When best placed for observing the other half of Pluto , the spacecraft would lie too far out from the planet . The probe will flat past Pluto 3.2 days either before or after Mariner does . Since 3.2 days is half of Pluto 's rotation period , the two ships will photograph opposite hemispheres during closest approach . ( Another option scientists are studying is to equip Mariner with such a superb camera that it can study Pluto well even from a great distance . This would eliminate the need for the probe . Weeks before the flyby , Pluto and Charon will fill the cameras of the spacecraft . During the encounter , the spacecraft will achieve a resolution of 1 to 2 km across the entire surface , meaning that the spacecraft can see objects that small . This is comparable to the resolution of Voyager 's best images of Triton . In places , however , the resolution may be as good as 50 meters , similar to the resolution of the best pictures we now have of Mars from spacecraft orbiting that planet . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charon really look like . Mariner images may reveal polar caps and geysers on Pluto as well as substances other than methane ice on its surface . The spacecraft may find that Pluto resembles Charon or that the two worlds differ radically . In addition , Mariner will search or new satellites orbiting Pluto . The Mariner spacecraft will skim close to Pluto , perhaps just 3,000 km above the planet 's frigid surface . It will not only measure the composition of Pluto 's atmosphere from afar but also sample it from within , for the craft will pass directly through Pluto 's tenuous upper atmosphere . We already know Pluto 's atmosphere has methane , but it may also contain nitrogen or carbon monoxide . To study Pluto 's atmosphere further and to search or one around Charon , the probe will beam radio signals through the atmospheres of Pluto and Charon to the Mariner spacecraft , and Mariner itself will observe Pluto 's atmosphere as the spacecraft passes behind the planet . Such studies will give further information on the structure of Pluto 's atmosphere . The spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solar system . But Mariner 's mission will not be over . Speeding at 3.0 to 3.3 AU a year , the spacecraft should reach a distance of over 100 AU from the Sun before the craft 's signals grow too weak to hear . Before attaining this distance , the spacecraft may enter the Kuiper belt , a region of the solar system that many scientists believe contains comets . First proposed by Gerard Kuiper in the 1950s , this comet belt may extend from just beyond Neptune 's orbit to several hundred AU from the Sun . The Kuiper belt is distinct in two ways from the better known Oort cloud , which also contains comets . First , the Kuiper belt is much closer to the Sun than the Oort cloud is ; second , the Kuiper belt is flattened , whereas the Oort cloud is spherical . As the Mariner spacecraft travels beyond Pluto , it may detect bodies in the Kuiper belt by feeling their gravitational pull . Also , the spacecraft will search for dust produced when objects in the Kuiper belt collide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune craft will be on its way . Launched in 2002 , the Neptune mission will meet Venus in late 2002 and again in 2004 , Earth in 2005 , and Jupiter in 2007 . Each flyby will alter the trajectory , and the final one , with Jupiter , will sling the craft to Neptune . Along the way , the spacecraft will examine Venus , Earth , a few asteroids , and the Jovian system . The most exciting encounter , though , will occur several years after the Jupiter flyby . In 2010 or 2011 , as the craft journeys between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus , it may encounter , from far , the mysterious object Charon . In 1977 , when Charles Kowal discovered this 200-km-wide body , astronomers classified it an asteroid . Since then , however , the " asteroid " has developed a coma , a halo of gas and dust suggesting that Charon is a gigantic comet ( see " The Changing Face of Charon " by William K. Hartmann , August 1990 issue ) . Mariner will probably pass over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distance the spacecraft should tell us something . Scientists are presently studying how close Mariner can approach Charon and still stay on course or Neptune . Mariner will reach Neptune in 2021 . One to three weeks prior to encounter , the spacecraft will send its probe on a mission into Neptune 's thick atmosphere . The same day the Mariner spacecraft achieves orbit around Neptune , the probe will strike the top of Neptune 's atmosphere . A heat shield will protect the probe from incineration . After jettisoning the heat shield , the probe will deploy a parachute to slow its descent . The probe will float through the clouds and get tossed about by the winds , all the while measuring the temperature , pressure , and composition of the atmosphere . When the probe reaches a pressure of about 15 bars ( one bar is one Earth atmospheric pressure ) , it will cut off its parachute and plunge fast into the heart of Neptune . Down and down the probe will fall , investigating the depths of Neptune 's atmosphere before the planet crushes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as its probe dies , the Mariner spacecraft will begin orbiting Neptune . The spacecraft will study the planet , its moons , and its rings for at least four years . mariner 's first orbit will be leisurely , taking 200 days . At its farthest from Neptune , the spacecraft will fire its rockets and reverse motion , so that the spacecraft 's orbit around Neptune , becomes retrograde , like Triton 's , With retrograde orbit , Mariner can study Triton better , because the spacecraft will then fly more slowly relative to Triton than it otherwise would . The first encounter with Triton will shrink the spacecraft 's orbit and reduce the period from 200 days to 80 days . As it circles Neptune , Mariner will continually observe the clouds and winds in the planet 's atmosphere and probe Neptune 's magnetic field . But Triton is the main attraction . Mariner will make 25 to 40 close approaches to the wayward moon , at times coming within mere 500 km of the satellite 's surface . Mariner will map most of Triton , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution . Furthermore , the best resolution should be at 20 to 50 times better than Voyager 's . The spacecraft will monitor Triton 's atmosphere and geysers , seeing how they and the rest of Triton have changed on the satellite . Mariner will also study the other moons , Eccentric Nereid will receive a close visit , as will at least one other satellite , perhaps Proteus , the second largest . the spacecraft will conduct a search for new moons around Neptune and study the rings as well . Both the Neptune mission and its Pluto counterpart promise a scientific return as enormous as the project itself is ambitious . Neptune , Triton , and Pluto are cold , remote worlds that huddle on the frigid frontier of the solar system , billions of miles distant . To investigate these far-off worlds thoroughly requires the daring and imagination that mark the country 's spirit of adventure and exploration .
