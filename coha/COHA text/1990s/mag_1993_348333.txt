There is a rising chorus for intervention in the Balkan wars . It is a call to folly . There is an understandable desire to " do something "  --  but without any calculation of cost or effectiveness . Worse , without any consideration of the objective . <P> The impulse for intervention is all means and no ends . For the question in Bosnia is not intervention . The question is , Intervention in the service of what political objective ? <P> If the objective is the re-creation of the Bosnian state  --  a fiction with no history of independence , a state composed of ethnic groups with a demonstrated and murderous inability to live together  --  then intervention is sheer madness . Well-intentioned madness , but madness nonetheless . Perhaps a year ago a prescient West could have stationed forces to prevent the current war . But that time is long past . The Bosnian egg can not be unscrambled . Intervention to reconstitute the broken Bosnian state would require enormous force , entail enormous risk , and offer no chance of success . <P> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only conceivable solution  --  partition along lines proposed by the Vance-Owen mediation  --  is at least rational . If bombing Serbian guns or arming the Muslims would bring the recalcitrant Serbs around , then intervention might make sense . <P> But such calculations are not so easy . Intervention on behalf of the Muslims might make the Serbs more pliable , but it might also make the Muslims more intractable . " Shifting battlefield fortunes have apparently made Bosnia 's Slavic Muslim-led government reluctant to accept the ( ( Vance ) ) plan , " reports Peter Maass of the Washington Post . And nothing would shift Muslim battlefield fortunes more than American intervention . Its mere prospect has hardened the Muslim negotiating position . <P> What to do ? Give all sides an ultimatum : Accept the Vance-Owen partition , or else . Serbs risk aerial bombardment , Muslims risk total abandonment . <P> The virtue of partition is that it is the only real chance for peace . The nine-year-old girls on sleds now being murdered by half-witted gunmen will not be saved by relief convoys that bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be saved by dreams of rolling Serbia out of Bosnia . They will only be saved by peace . And if we 've learned anything from Cyprus and India and Palestine , it is that the best way to bring peace is to separate the combatants and let them live apart . <P> The Vance plan would let the Bosnians do that within a largely ceremonial and insubstantial Bosnian state . Yet there is much grumbling in the U.S. about Vance . Those who worshipped him when his State Department was negotiating away American control of the Panama Canal now find him insufficiently zealous in ; defending Muslim interests in Bosnia . <P> The grumblers object that the Vance plan gives the Serbs too much territory . They make up only 31% of the Bosnian population and would end up with 42% of the territory . But that overlooks the fact that the Serbs are the most rural people in Bosnia . They owned or occupied about 60% of the country before the war ( up to 70% now ) . Vance would have them give up about a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so reluctant to sign on .
