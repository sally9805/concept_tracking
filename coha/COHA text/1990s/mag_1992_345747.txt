When a writer for the stage reveals great promise but has not yet produced fully satisfying work , old hands are apt to remark , " I 'm not sure there 's a play here , but there 's certainly a playwright . " Just such tempered optimism is being triggered right now by two emotionally intense , fiercely funny and sadly flawed works by dramatists in their early 30s . One writer  --  Howard Korder  --  has the slam-bang dialogue and macho preoccupations of a David Mamet in training . The other  --  Jon Robin Baitz  --  can infuse domestic drama with the burdens of history in the fashion of a budding Arthur Miller . But neither can yet write two cumulative and cohesive acts . In each of their current offerings , one act sings , the other does n't . <P> Korder first showed talent with 1987 's Fun , a teenage boy 's nihilist spree , and burst into prominence in 1988 with Boys ' Life , a Mametian glimpse of postadolescent rituals of drinking , puking , courting and infidelity . In Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men his own age who have achieved material success but feel an inner hollowness . They seek cures ranging from ritual maleness a la Iron John to shedding their ties and common sense in reckless crusades for adventure . The central character , played by film actor Griffin Dunne , reacts to a busted marriage and a Florida income tax problem by turning to a trio of cliche badass pursuits : cross-country wandering ( the show 's sole set is a highway ) , crime ( involving , naturally , suitcases of white powder ) and moviemaking . Of these , Korder presents the cinema as the most corrupt ; it takes an impromptu murder to get the antihero really launched as a mogul . <P> The action is episodic , and most characters are fleeting , placing more stress on Dunne 's performance than his lightweight , ingratiating style can bear . The first act is expository and lamely comic , acutely lacking the menace and madness that make the second act crackle . Sometimes the play is a chilling rumination on ' 80s greed . Sometimes it 's merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremely cynical . Korder asserts with equal force that run-amuck individualism is appalling and that it is the one sure path to triumph . <P> Baitz came to notice in Los Angeles in 1987 and off-Broadway the next year with The Film Society , a story of a failed teacher in South Africa , where the writer spent much of his youth . His latest effort , The Substance of Fire , is at Lincoln Center after a sold-out run at the smaller Playwrights Horizons . Structurally , the problems are the opposite of the Korder play 's . The first half , about a family dispute over a publishing empire , surges with believable life . The second half , about the clan 's Holocaust-scarred patriarch , clanks with calculation . <P> The pieces fit logically . Three yuppieish children who ungratefully depose their father in the interest of fiscal stability are stand-ins for the whole indulged baby-boom generation . The burnt-out father , who obsesses about the past and about a supposed universal abandonment of standards , epitomizes a dying elitist culture . But while the children emerge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy brilliance can not make plausible the contrived second act , which centers on the father 's buying and burning an original painting by Hitler .
