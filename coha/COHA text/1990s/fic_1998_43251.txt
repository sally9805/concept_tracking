1 . Those Absent <p> Any reasonable baby shower would have properly culminated in the videocorder with the instant playback feature . The present was addressed to The Formerly Thin Addie Ling from her three tactless brothers , and arrived suspiciously wrapped in a brown paper grocery bag . There was no box or warranty card . If the camera was hot , nobody said so . As for the bag , this was fastened with an antique diaper pin courtesy of Addie 's number two brother , Billy , who was Mr. Flea Market in the family as a result of having gone to prep school . No one could explain it , but that 's what had happened . He had gone in wearing Nike everything , thanks to money he had made with his paper route , and had come out a 1930 's North Woods type who read Herodotus by lantern light . Billy could ice fish . He talked suddenly slowly . He left off talking after making his point . That proved the most dramatic change , and the most unnerving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into what was apparently his adulthood . Now he was forty-two and still doing it . <p> To be fair , Addie thought that the outdoorsy persona was about embarrassment . He was embarrassed to have turned even more thoughtful than he was before . He had always been a guy who sought the bottom of things , as if there were a bottom that could be found-as if people could do more in life than paw down through one viscous reality into another mess . Addie found this charming . She herself knew what it was to wade into a field full of lupine and be filled with wonderment . Once , too , in a rogue storm on a mountaintop , she had dropped to her knees and prayed-not knowing what else to do in the onslaught of water and wind-and the extremis of that moment had stayed with her . She recalled the cold press of the hard stone , and the rain running from her clumped hair ; she remembered the sky-brutal , powermad , dead to mercy . And recalling those things , she understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of saying he did n't belong to the quotidian world . He belonged to the world of transcendence , like a priest . <p> But Addie 's stepbrother , Mark , liked to say that Billy-Will , he called himself now , had in fact called himself for some twentyodd years-looked as though he had lent L. L. Bean his first tent . And was n't that some trick for a nice Chinese boy from the wilds of a Boston suburb ? In contrast , he , Mark Lee , the youngest of the boys , was Mr. Real World . He had gone from a public high school to a state college and lived , being the last son , the dumb son , his father 's son . <p> These days Mark wore blue jeans and T-shirts and drove a red Ford station wagon with a factory third seat he had liberated from a car wreck in a junkyard . This he had installed himself , much to the delight of his kids . Mark once explained to Addie how he figured the third seat had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory-installed , and , of course , he was right . Mark was always , well , on the mark . This was how he had come to head the family building business . Mark could predict which streets would get plowed first in a snowstorm and how long the whole cleanup would take . He could make sure their street was plowed early-not so early as to attract attention , but early . Mark was the brother who had arranged for , and possibly fixed up , the videocamera , loading and charging it in the meantime , so that it would be ready for immediate use . <p> As for the card , Addie was amazed to see that Mark and Billy had gotten Neddie , her number one brother , to sign it himself , in that chicken-scratch handwriting that Mark used to call positive proof he was headed for a padded cell , until Neddie went into the hospital . Then for once Mark did n't say anything at all , prompting Billy to remark how heartening it was to see that Mark sometimes knew when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower , but so familiar was his absence that it had become his presence . In this , he was unlike their father figure , Reynolds , who in his absence from the shower could be considered more authentically missing . <p> 2 . The Shower Proper <p> Now Addie panned around the room . To zoom or not to zoom ? From the casbah comfort of an upholstered rocking chair , Addie tipped forward , touching her feet to the floor to steady the shot . Forward-voila . There was her beaming husband , Rex , looking as though he had just won a Nobel Prize , the first ever given for paternity . He called himself a mongrel Mongol , and indeed had the romantic slashing brow and broad planar cheeks that evoked a wind-blown life chasing sheep on the steppe ; never mind that he was half Japanese . Addie zoomed back . Now you could see how he was flanked by females . These were friends of Addie 's , around whom Rex had looped his arms playboy-style . Actually he was a sensitive intellectual engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless they all waved little flat babe waves before Rex disengaged and leaned forward , elbows on his knees , with a serious look . " I just want to say , " he announced , " now , and for history , that you , Addie Ling , are the love of my life . My harem is nothing to me . " <p> At this everyone laughed , even Addie 's women 's studies friends , who had over the years practically come to appreciate him . " That 's good , since I 'm sure you are nothing to them , " she managed-not the best reply , but people did laugh at that , too . After all , it was her shower , and they loved her . Addie had always thought Rex should have married someone with a gift for the comeback line rather than someone who felt pressured by banter , as she did . But he claimed it was hard enough being married to someone who was always right , he needed to at least know the good lines were his . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the study in contrasts who nonetheless looked surprisingly alike . Mark 's hair was short , Billy 's in a ponytail . But both wore shorts that showed off their surpassing fitness and sparsely hairy legs . They both seemed to be idling about , awaiting suitable challenge . And they waved with similar nonchalance-as if this was yet another thing they could do one-handed . <p> " Try the date button ; ' said Mark . <p> Billy turned toward some veggie dip . " Billy , " said Addie . " You have to say something . " <p> He turned around with a largish spear of broccoli , and wielded it like a microphone . " This is Billy Ling , reporting live from the shower of the century , " he said . Then he turned back sideways to the camera again . <p> " Come on ; " said Addie . <p> " Some party , " he said . <p> " Billy . " <p> " Some camera . " <p> " Billy . " <p> " I 'm going to work for Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " said Addie . <p> " He 'll be a real asset , " said Mark . <p> " It is my deepest ambition " intoned Billy . He wielded his broccoli mike once again . " I have always yearned to be an asset . " <p> Beside them chattered Addie 's five sisters-in-law , none of whom knew what irony was . Mark 's wife seemed to have modeled herself on the late Princess Diana of Wales ; this involved headgear and a vaguely tragic air . Then there were Addie 's roommates from college and graduate school , some of whom had updated , but others of whom you could pick out in a lineup as ex-hippies . Emma Rose , for example , wore all natural fiber ; Mark said she looked like a model for a burlap store . The one buddy Addie had kept up with from junior high , Jessica , likewise still did a gypsy look , with a matching manner that involved clasping people 's hands as she talked ; she was full of exaltation . In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy for their age . Still young , as opposed to plain young , they no longer talked about Life as if it were the next city on a walking tour . They were knowledgeable about knee procedures and dental work , and wary of what came next-either justifiably or needlessly , Addie had heard both . For now Addie saw in her eyepiece that apprehension gave rise to a special clear happiness-magical as the pane of blue ice that let a wavery square of light into modern-day igloos . <p> That pane was broken , thankfully , by only one unhappy mother , hers . Addie swept guiltily past Madame Lee , as Rex called her , vaguely hoping that Rex had not put her on wrapping paper duty . For even after forty years here , Regina was ambivalent at best about pitching in American-style to events like these . She took offense at the idea that anyone would expect her to help like a servant . And asking is expecting , Addie explained to Rex , who locked eyes with her as she spoke and , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words . " I hear you , " he said . " You have spoken . " <p> Yet there was Regina , balling up the paper with the nobly suffering air of a movie star in a labor camp , while Addie 's motherin-law on Prozac fairly beamed with the honor of keeping a gift inventory . Doreen waved enthusiastically at the camera lest it miss her and , when Addie zoomed in , advised for the ages , " Lists are important . Believe me . You simply can not rely on your mind . " A nisei from Hawaii , Doreen had more foundation on one cheek than the other , and had once told Addie that Japan was the most amazing place she had ever been . The women there , she said , put on nylons to go to the grocery store . The men get perms . <p> Behind Doreen stood Addie 's friend Lorna 's books-beat-up seminal tomes subsumed by bright volumes of Brazelton and Leach . Nearby , world travel artifacts commingled with a wide selection of educational toys and stuffed sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manta ray-and what appeared to be a token teddy bear . In front of them stood the automatic baby swing that Lorna had said used an unconscionable number of batteries . If she had to do it over again , she would get a windup , but anyway , she hoped Addie would accept the loan , which she accompanied with a crate full of batteries of every size . This , in addition to the shower , was her present to Addie , who had exclaimed with real surprise when she opened it . " Everything takes batteries , " said Lorna . There was another box , too , from Lorna s husband , Ken , to Rex . This , it turned out , was full of scotch tape . " All will become clear in time , " said Ken . " Just wait . " <p> Addie filmed these things thinking how glad she was that , like Neddie and Reynolds , she was not going to be in the picture . She wondered , too , whether she could have avoided gaining forty pounds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not under twenty-five . These thoughts were so retrograde that she could hardly believe them hers . She had read The Second Sex in high school , and underlined everything . All her adult life , she had refused to be objectified . Yet the thoughts seemed to have a life of their own , like her body , potent and miraculous , yet big as a submersible , and on a mission she was most notably not directing . <p> The baby began an aerobics routine ; Addie flexed her turgid feet . People called summer pregnancies the worst , but at least you were spared having to wear real shoes . And if your body seemed a spectacle , at least everybody else was a body , too , all armpits and skin moles . She was hardly the only one with an inelegant appendage . Addie sneakily recorded for the ages several inelegant appendages , then more sweetly continued on to not only the batteries and the scotch tape , but the more traditional presents . These Addie made her friends hold up and explain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child 's tush . " <p> " This is a rattle , designed to encourage early grasping . " <p> " This is a breast pump , for comic relief . " <p> Inspired , it seemed , by their testimonial , Regina produced from the next room one last present . She moved slowly , as if , though the same age as Rex 's mother , she were far more elderly . She had had her hair done in a petrified dandelion puff for the shower , and she put her hand up to it from time to time , as if to be sure it was stage-ready . <p> The present was not wrapped . " I explain for you , " she offered ; and so Addie filmed as Regina held up a stuffed sailfish . " This fish your father give to me for last year anniversary present , " she said . " This year I give to you . We are getting divorced after thirty-five years marriage , I have no place even to stay now . " <p> At this Addie put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could leap-and of course offered her mother sanctuary with her . She took the sailfish from Regina 's arms , attempting to embrace her mother at the same time . This was not quite possible , but the intention was clear . Her stepbrother , Mark , picked up the camera and caught the rest of the exchange . " I am your difficult mother . Our whole lives we fight . How can I move into your house ? " Still Addie insisted , trying as she spoke to put the sailfish down . Its sail was so high that she could barely see over it . She made her heartfelt offer into a shellacked ribbed fin . But it was heard . By the time a friend rescued Addie from the trophy , other friends had chimed in encouragingly . <p> " Perfect ! " proclaimed Jessica , predictably ecstatic . After all , Addie and Rex were going to need help , and how nice for the baby to get to know its grandmother ! <p> " No help . " Regina waved her wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers were stiffly splayed in a no-nonsense manner ; only her pinky arched back coyly with a slight crook . ( This was the same pinky that reared like a prairie dog when she picked up a teacup . ) Her manner , correspondingly , was despairing in an alert sort of way-edging , like the cry of a child , from a wail of sheer pain to something more artistic . Addie watched as the wave of flat refusal became a wave of polite refusal , then of pro forma refusal . By this time Regina 's predicament had inspired a kind of call and response . <p> " No help , no help , " said Regina . <p> " Of course you 'll be a help ! " said the crowd . <p> " Addie has no room . " <p> " Addie will make room ! " <p> " Who wants an old lady come live with them ? " <p> " They do , they do . They welcome you ! They want you ! " <p> Finally , Madame Lee agreed to be welcomed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV show . Then Doreen moved to congratulate Regina while Lorna and Ken brought out dessert-a cake with a jogger stroller drawn on top . The jogger stroller held a big question mark . <p> Pillow Talk <p> " Shh . See ? It 's moving . " <p> Rex successfully connected with a kick , but then drew Addie 's T-shirt back down like a shade and continued his miracle appreciation through the cloth . In principle he adored her belly , her taut and mottled , veiny belly , with its popped-out navel like a gag from a joke shop . But in practice he did not adore it . In this way he was out of step with his times . He dimly recognized that the body had in fact snuck in , mid-century , to dominate contemporary thought . No truth but in things . No ideas but in hormones . Yet how was he supposed to feel about Addie 's avid interest in their neighbor 's dog 's new litter , for example ? A year ago it would have been Frank Stella 's mid-career crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to the Indian Birds , and what Caravaggio would have thought of these aggressive steel constructions projecting a foot out from the wall . Now Rex watched , aghast , as Addie and the bitch exchanged soulful glances of mutual understanding . The bitch was a dachshund , no less . And what did Addie talk of now , endlessly , but her body ? This twinge , that twinge " a funny fullness , a distinct soreness . Stretching , rumblings , gas . Her entire belly sometimes lurched from one side to the other as the baby sought to get more comfortable . How uncomfortable they all were ! He least of all ; and yet it was no small , poignant , delighted terror he felt as he watched Addie grow larger than him and sexually voracious . More , more , more . This was n't in any manual he had read . <p> " My mother , " she said . <p> He shook his head sympathetically . " We can only hope she 'll come to our senses . <p> " Very funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in town . My mother ran into them at the club , can you imagine ? A redhead wearing that kind of bikini where the top does n't even match the bottom . " <p> " No wonder your mother 's upset . " <p> " Where are we going to put her ? " <p> " In the nursery , of course . Where she belongs . " <p> " It 'll be like having twins . " <p> Rex thought this over . " There 's always murder , " he concluded . " Smother her with a pillow . " <p> " Do n't you think that would be ethically problematic ? If we did n't at least first try to discourage her from moving in ? " <p> " We 'll smother her with a pillow and see if that discourages her . " <p> " That fish was n't even an anniversary present . I mean , Reynolds gave it to her , but not for their anniversary . " <p> " Did he at least catch it himself ? " <p> At this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I married you , " she said , closing her eyes firmly . She had an air of utter resignation . " You are truly hard to talk to . " All the same , she cagily advanced a hand onto his waiting thigh . <p> The Problem <p> Their condo , on the second floor of a three-family house , was not large . Their condo was , in fact , small , as befitted two people with meaningful professions . Rex did low-income housing in the inner city . This represented a personal victory of sorts , as it had been a struggle for him , the firstborn of his family , to become this variety of do-gooder . Not that there had never been a family dogooder before . In fact , his mother 's father had been a Buddhist priest in Japan . He had had his own temple , via which he had made a fortune mumbling sutras at funerals . <p> The trouble was that Doreen thought Rex should find himself a similar monopoly situation . For example , as a doctor in some remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rex had explained , explained , and finally given up explaining . Finally he had turned deaf ear , as Doreen complained-an achievement , to his mind , in itself . He had felt sorry for his classmates with better hearing who had gone to medical school . The ones with immigrant parents in particular seemed to do nothing but perform , perform , only to be pronounced still lacking . If they were practitioners , they were n't researchers . If they were internists , they were n't surgeons . Rex had realized that you had to live your own life . He had broken with his family 's expectations-realizing , as he liked to admit , that he could use all the nobility he could get . <p> But more recently he noticed that , parent-plagued or not , his doctor friends were certainly most comfortably trapped . How easy it was to get burned on second houses , they lamented . Whereas , what with the baby coming , he was beginning to wonder whether he could n't trade in , say , half of his unimpeachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in one of his housing projects himself . <p> In this regard , Addie , a garden designer , was no help . If she would go back to school , she might at least someday bill at landscape architect rates . But she pointedly did not because , she said , she liked the humbleness of her work as it was . In her twenties she had aspired to achieve immortality as a sculptress ; she had even had a flirtation with marble . But in her thirties , she had come to realize that all her ambition was about death . It was about defying death . It was about denying death . It was about death , death , death ! A friend had given her a book about this ; the friend later asked for the book back . But it was too late . Addie was working then in primitive materials like soap and felt , and achieving some recognition for her work . She had in fact just had a piece of hers hung at the Museum of Fine Arts right opposite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art was over for her . <p> That 's when she became first a hospice worker , and then an artisan-a person who took small spaces and simply made them beautiful . Sometimes her efforts were nontraditional . Once she made a pergola of Coke bottles ; once a mossy swale ; once a garden of tennis balls on stakes . But she also planted tree hydrangeas for children to run under , coneflowers to attract butterflies . She did reliable , joyous gardens for Rex 's city projects . Everything was addressed to the humans living in the shadow of the large mountain , and not to the mountain itself . <p> 5 . Addie 's Room Becomes Regina 's Room <p> It was n't until Regina and the baby that Addie wished her practice a less modest activity . For as the site of a modest activity , Addie 's workroom became an irresistible topic of discussion . <p> " I do n't know how comfortable I am , your books and paper everywhere , " said Regina . " Where am I going to put my clothes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will have no time for gardening , anyway . " <p> " Gardening , she called it , " grumbled Addie to Rex . <p> Luckily , Mark , hearing of their dilemma , offered to help . " We 'll convert that kitchen closet of yours into a home office , " he said . " Put in a pull-down desk with some built-in storage . I 've got some exotic wood trim from another job-beautiful stuff , you can have it for free . Billy of the Northlands can supply the labor ; it 's his chance to learn how to hold a hammer . I 'll charge you cost . " <p> Rex and Addie pondered this offer . Would it simply encourage Regina never to move out ? <p> " Of course he wants her to be comfortable here , " said Rex . <p> " He 's afraid she 'll be looking next at his beautiful place , with the renovated kitchen and the pool in the backyard . He knows if she could stand his wife he 'd be sunk : ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; " said Addie . <p> " How interesting , " said Rex . <p> " I ca n't work in a closet , " said Addie . Addie said , " The kitchen is noisy " <p> All the same , the next Saturday , they were looking at plans , with Mark , in the kitchen , when the first of the contractions came . Was it a Braxton-Hicks ? thought Addie . But it was nothing like a Braxton-Hicks . <p> " It 's happening , " said Addie . She stood up ; then sat back down . <p> " What 's happening ? " said Rex , looking at the drawings . Rex loved drawings . <p> " Nothing " she said then , and leaned over the drawings , too , as if deliriously absorbed . Once upon a time , Neddie the Absent used to look around at them all and announce , You see me not , to which Regina would reply , What you talking about ? and You must be crazy ! Now Addie was going to a hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much more likely it was that she would have too many visitors than too few . Yet as Mark talked of a board that could be easily unhinged , she thought of Neddie and of Billy , and of their father , so long dead she had no memory of him . Had Neddie ever held a newborn before ? Probably not , she guessed ; another contraction gripped her ; she looked at the clock , her mind turning , fearfully , toward labor . But even as it turned , she thought for just one more moment of what a treat it would be for him to meet the baby . She could picture his face already , soft with delight , yet crying-he cried at everything , poor Neddie . She could picture him trembling like an old man at the very prospect of visitors . This is my child , she would say . He would say , But of course . Then he would open his arms with the sudden strength of the happy . How very bald , he would say . How very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger in the family . <p>
