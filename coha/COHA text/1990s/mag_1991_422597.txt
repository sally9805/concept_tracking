<p> BY LATE SPRING , DARK ARRIVES an hour before midnight in Paris . It falls especially gently on the eighth arrondissement . Outside the Plaza Athenee , chauffeurs buff door handles with pressed linen handkerchiefs . In the jewel-box apartments along Avenue Montaigne , even the lamb chops wear starched panties . <p> But what is that sound ? Nom de dieu , a bus ! Somehow it has wallowed in between the Bentleys and Jaguars outside the soigne Theatre des Champs Elysees . The abomination idles noisily as it takes on two dozen or so Americans in jeans and khakis . They carry duffels crammed with sweat-soaked clothes , they smoke , they moan a bit . <p> They are dancers , some of the world 's best , but these are no bony Balanchine clones , all clavicle and Big Eyes . Save for a smattering of dreadlocks , these folks would n't look out of place in a Wichita Pizza Hut . There are tall women with busts , short ones with fannies , men with receding hairlines . Last onto the bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern dance 's fave fauve . <p> Tonight , Morris could be Dante Rossetti from the neck up , with his Pre-Raphaelite curls and heavy-lashed peepers ; from the waist down , he 's Ward Cleaver gone to seed . He wears baggy plaid bermudas , sandals and orange socks . He 's carrying a battered shopping bag . <p> Come on , Mark . Please ? ' <p> Morris climbs into the back seat , the time-honored perch of the class wiseass . The doors close , and the bus farts diesel into the chestnut blossoms . In the dark , the dancers talk pain and metatarsals and the challenges of gastronomie on a modest per diem . Even at the top , modern dancers get fewer perks than most heavy-metal roadies . Morris 's dancers have played the world 's finest concert and opera halls , have shared the stage with no less than Mikhail Baryshnikov , but they still spend too much time in Europe 's capitals watching their tights go around in unbeautiful launderettes . <p> The driver swings the wheel out toward the lights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beloved excursions to the opera and to chamber-music recitals , Morris says he 's found time to hop one of these floating tourist dives . <p> Oh , tack-orama , ' someone says . <p> The thing to do , ' Morris counters , is get a six-pack and sit outside , way in the back . Its faaaaaaabulous . ' <p> He knows his Schonberg , but he 's no snob . Morris can parse the canons of the most complex Handel oratorio - but he 's addicted to Jeopardy ! Says he worships ' its host , Alex Trebek . The dance critics like to say that Mark Morris effortlessly merges high and low culture . ' He 'll tell you he just likes to have F-U-N . Morris loves to smoke , drink and eat . He is tall , strong and muscular , but you can pinch more than an inch over the waistband of his bermudas . He teaches his grueling dance classes with a lit Dunhill and a cold Kronenbourg , a-one-two-three chug ! <p> All the way back to the hotel , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Last one off the bus , Morris tosses his curls and wails into the silent hotel courtyard : Where are we GOING ? What will we EAT ? Just who is coming with me tonight ? ' <p> <p> SO EXHAUSTING TO BE THE DAD IN DANCE NEVER-NEVER Land , this generous continent of state subsidies , live orchestras and prawns the size of stadium franks . Oh , it was much harder - depressing as hell - when Mark Morris was leading his fledgling troupe across the American heartland several years ago , a night in Sheboygan , Wisconsin , a day in Ames , Iowa . So dispiriting to dance to taped music before 400 baffled folks in a 3000-seat university hall , so punishing on body and soul . <p> This is not glamour , this is dance in America : Ace bandages , second jobs and too many nights dialing Domino 's from a Motel 6 . At home in New York , Morris wandered Paragon Sporting Goods like a broke and divorced father of ten as his dancers culled costumes from the bargain bins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master and virtuoso , now that he has been awarded a $225,000 genius grant ' from the MacArthur Foundation , now that even Newsweek has anointed him the crown prince and long-awaited savior of the dance world , ' the living is easier . The responsibilities are not . Costs for a week 's performances of his masterwork L'Allegro , il penseroso ed il moderato ran at about $300,000 per week when it was last done in the States at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . During its run in Paris , Morris must oversee twenty-four dancers , a full orchestra , a chorus and five soloists . Today , before the evening 's dress rehearsal , the choreographer-savior suffered a forty-five-second breakdown at the stage entrance . <p> We all got off the bus , and I was the last , ' he says . I looked down the alley and there were , like , a thousand people , and THEY WERE ALL IN MY COMPANY . Everybody was working for ME , doing this dance , happy or blue , tired or not , bummed or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater . And I wanted to get back on the bus . Like , OH , SHIT . WHAT HAVE I DONE ? ' <p> It 's probably easier to explain what Mark Morris has not done to get himself hailed as the world 's most exciting living choreographer ' in an often moribund art form . Morris 's is n't the eye-glazing , butt-numbing kind of Modern Dance that has anorexics in torn gauze impersonating Village Women at the Well . Morris has walked out on that stuff , even booed it on occasion . I HATE modern dance , ' he 'll tell you , again and again . He has such a horror of boredom , he 'd never want to do that to you . Some of the fun ' things he 's come up with : <p> A hilarious version of the Nutcracker with Sixties costumes , Morris as a sleazoid lounge lizard , dudes in tutus and a segment featuring the hokeypokey ( The Hard Nut ) . <p> A dance to Hopi Indian chants sung by the New York City Gay Men 's Chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stompin ' hoedown to the best of Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys ( Going Away Party ) . <p> Three solos to country &; western music ( Deck of Cards ) for himself , Baryshnikov and a remote-controlled toy eighteen-wheeler . ( I like dancing with the truck , ' says Baryshnikov . It takes a very nice curtain call . ' ' ) <p> Morris also choreographs to Brahms , Stravinsky and Vivaldi . In L'Allegro , he drops in a doggie-pee-pee joke danced to Handel , then lays on a finale so glorious and unabashedly up with people that the most jaded downtown dance hag will set to bawling all over her black Gaultier stretchies . Brooklyn insurance salesmen , Parisian demimondaines , stand up and holler - such is the democratic effect of Morris 's big American brain . <p> Now , at thirty-five , working at maximum warp , Morris has the hyperreceptors of a satellite dish , pulling in dance vocabulary from Bali , Yugoslavia , India and the American Southwest . But he is no mindless channel zapper . Out of all those mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global dance . Cultural borrowing does n't cheapen a dance form , he insists : I do n't think it dilutes it - it expands it . ' ' . <p> And there 's room for everybody . Morris 's ensemble dances often use the line and circle configurations of the oldest folk forms . Men and women lift one another with equal elan . In a Morris work , strength , aggression and tenderness are not gender-specific . Everyone has to be able to do everything , ' he likes to say . Despite his sophistications , Morris has the big , galumphing heart of a Sixties communard . He calls his troupe the Mark Morris Dance Group because company sounds too dictatorial . <p> He 's a very old-fashioned choreographer in his values , ' says Baryshnikov . He is maybe outrageous and an eye-catcher with his behavior , but his main values are very down-to-earth . He 's sentimental but never drooly . ' Baryshnikov first commissioned a Morris work as artistic director of the American Ballet Theater . Now the two collaborate on Baryshnikov 's White Oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Mark and Misha roadshow progressed , they became good friends . Baryshnikov concedes that Morris is often Mr. Loud in public . For the rare quiet times , Baryshnikov has lent Morris his retreat on St. Bart 's . Throughout his friend 's life Baryshnikov sees a duality . ' <p> The Two Marks is a recurrent theme among those close to Morris . Dancer Erin Matthiessen , who has known Morris for more than a decade , describes the private Mark who was actually very shy , could be very quiet and sentimental , and this other Mark - the public performing Mark who tells stories , is really loud - one of the most obnoxious people I know . ' <p> It 's not something that goes unnoticed by Morris himself . But he tends to reserve introspection for his work . He split himself in two for his staging of Purcell 's opera Dido and Aeneas , dancing the parts of Queen Dido of Carthage and her dreadful enemy , the Sorceress . He says the latter was modeled on the Disney bitch Cruella de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris 's dual self-casting . . . is part of his persona - an artist searching for stage truth or a rogue who dares to wave his sexuality like a banner . ' <p> Before anyone starts diagnosing multiple personalities , Baryshnikov is quick to point out the redeeming aspect of this yin yang pas de deux . Morris can be sardonically apolitical , resolutely atypical , but very often , he ca n't stand to be alone . And if he has a dance vision , ' says Baryshnikov , it 's of dancing together . ' He says it shows in Morris 's ensemble dances : The important thing is the spiritual aspect of his work . People are supported . Anxieties are shouldered . That 's always interesting chemistry . ' <p> And the emotional requirements ? Baryshnikov laughs . Challenging . ' <p> <p> UMMMMM , NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT . ' <p> Morris is staring into a mirror in St. Germain 's clamorous Brasserie Lipp . He pats at the slight circles beneath his eyes . <p> I got really drunk last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a jumbo Slurpee . Today is the company 's day off ; opening night is tomorrow . Yes , he has misbehaved , but he does not perform in L'Allegro . And he will atone for his sins in the daily classes he teaches . Just now he 's thinking about more food . Oh , spring lamb . How can I NOT ? ' <p> He orders lunch in polite , serviceable French . After three years in Belgium as head of the company-in-residence at Brussels 's lavish state-supported Theatre Royal de la Monnaie opera house , Morris is one of the few in his company fluent in that language . He says it comes easily to him , like music . But he is leaving the Monnaie now to return to the States , taking with him ten new works , a better accent and not a few unsettling memories . <p> Morris says that when he arrived in Brussels in 1988 , he was dogged with an advance billing as a hard-drinkin ' , homosexual , chain-smoking , long-haired beast from modern-dance hell . ' Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company for a decade . <p> People thought I 'd been discovered in the jungle or something . ' <p> Perhaps it was that little je ne sais quoi in his presentation of self ? He did pose in Vanity Fair wearing little more than a fresh coat of lipstick and a veil of cigarette smoke . And his public comments about other choreographers have often landed him in the Dance Doghouse . But like Liberace , to whom he quite sincerely dedicated a dance , Morris tut-tuts over the lurid glow of his press clips . <p> I 've had reviews that drive my mother crazy , ' Morris says , so many that are about my hairdo and what I wear and the clove cigarettes I used to smoke . And the fact that I 'm gay and do n't apologize for it . And that I 'm , like , zany or something . It 's like oh , COME ON . Did you watch the DANCE or not ? ' <p> When Morris premiered L'Allegro at Monnaie in December of 1988 , American dance critics airlifted themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapture . L'Allegro is set to Handel 's 1740 oratorio ( which interpreted Milton 's pastoral odes of the 1630s ) . The plie pundits celebrated Morris 's deep musicality , his impressive technical range , his savvy classicism , his countless astonishments . ' L'Allegro was pronounced a modern-dance landmark . <p> So yes , they were watching - as was an evil horde of Belgian boo birds . These solid burghers were outraged at their tax dollars ' going to support an American troupe - one that replaced the beloved if barf-making ballet of Maurice Bejart . Bejart had ruled Belgian dance for twenty-seven years with well-received schlock that evoked Marquis de Sade meets the Chippendales . And Morris was less than diplomatic in his assessment of all those stud muffins in sequined jocks . ( Bejart 's work is shit . ' ' ) So from the start , the Belgians booed the Yanks . One headline said it all : MARK MORRIS GO HOME . <p> Given what the Belgians were used to , they did n't understand , says one of Morris 's dancers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on the stage , guys who do n't take our shirts off . ' <p> The magnificence of L'Allegro silenced the hecklers , but there was never to be a rapprochement . Deep in the Monnaie 's velvet-lined fortress , the Americans drew their wagons in an even tighter circle . <p> Belgium has really pulled my company together , ' Morris says . Partly because there was nothing else to do but work all the time . It was easy at first to say , Ecccch , Belgium , get me out of here . ' And now people feel weird about leaving . ' That 's partly because so much uncertainty lies across the Atlantic , where American cities are declaring bankruptcy and arts subsidies are as scarce as solvent S &Ls.; Morris had first tried to stage L'Allegro in Boston , until funding was pulled from under him . For three years at the Monnaie his troupe has had the best of everything - live music , a spectacular theater , extravagant rehearsal space , health insurance , physical therapists . Creatively , it 's been heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of hotels and cheap sublets . But the contract at Monnaie is at an end - as is that of theater director Gerard Mortier , the man who brought the company there . Morris was not asked to renew , and now he 's headed back to New York - poor , tarnished , dead broke New York . <p> It 's the worst time possible to bring a dance company to the States - the worst , ' Morris admits . The good part is that people missed us . The bad part is , nobody has any money . Everybody wants to see us , but no one can send the check . ' <p> Nonetheless , the group has a year 's worth of engagements . There was a late-summer tour for Morris and four of his dancers with Baryshnikov and the White Oak group . By November , Morris would be back in Brussels for the filming of The Hard Nut , to be seen on PBS next year . Then it 's back to the States . But he says he will fold his tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to do this one-night-stand bullshit , which sprains peoples ' ankles and makes the shows bad . I did that with other companies I worked with as a dancer . ' <p> Those companies included Eliot Feld , Lar Lubovitch , Hannah Kahn and Laura Dean . Morris was a purposeful gypsy , not wanting to hang anywhere long enough to become anyone 's heir apparent . When he started his own company in 1980 , he hired according to talent , loyalty - and against all types . His dancers are white , black , Asian , Hispanic . And if they can do his moves , he does n't care if they are n't a perfect size 2 . <p> Some of my women are stacked , ' Morris says . It 's great , I love it . ' In too many troupes , he complains , they do n't even look like women : You 're supposed to look as if you 've never had a period . It 's like white asparagus or veal . Horrifying ! ' <p> He makes a face over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York City Ballet . The dancing was lovely , but up close the ballerinas looked like they should be home playing Barbie . I love classical ballet and Balanchine , but I think that 's a bit unhealthy , ' Morris says . <p> So , too , is the state of American dance . Sure , everyone knows there 's no funding - that even the stately Martha Graham could barely support her troupe at the end , that Alvin Ailey was on the verge of bankruptcy when he accepted his Kennedy Center Honors . Morris thinks it has something to do with the ineffability of live performance . In these lip-sync times , some folks just do n't get it . <p> People always ask me if I have plans for videos . ' <p> For the last decade , even popular dance has been laid on the national brainpan , via video , from MJ 's pioneer moonwalk to Hammer 's high-impact aerobicizers . Dance is still vital and viable in the black community , Morris concedes . But elsewhere , it 's gone the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Forties was the last of it , with beautiful melodies in popular songs . Dancing was actually a cool and fun and organized thing to do . There is , of course , value in slamming and stage diving . ' Morris laughs . But it 's a different kind of thing . ' <p> Even formal ' dance occasions have gone to hell in a Yamaha handbasket . People do n't dance at weddings anymore , ' Morris says mournfully . You have this horrible synthesizer player . He does this stupid dance stuff . It 's ridiculous . There are no waltzes left . ' <p> Given the endless permutations and the way his brain works , Morris does n't figure he 'll ever run out of dances . His is a wonderful life but so - face it - so bizarre . He got to thinking about it when he was rehearsing the Klinghoffer show ' - the new Peter Sellars opera about the Achille Lauro hijacking and the murder of Leon Klinghoffer - and he figured it was time to make up a new piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him in a room with some props and five of his dancers . They did everything he told them to . At one point I said , Well , I would like three of you to put on paper cone noses , and I want you to be naked , ' ' he says . There were platforms , chairs and keys , and they were passing things around . And I watched for , like , three hours . And I thought , Why do I have the right to do that ? And what a strange job . ' It was so fun . It 's the same as forcing my friends in the neighborhood to do the same things - when you 're six . ' <p> Most little kids dance , he says . It 's a natural impulse until age and inhibitions stop you from shaking that tiny bootie . Every child goes through that let 's make stuff up ' phase . Morris laughs , spreads his arms . AND I NEVER STOPPED ! ' <p> <p> ON A SPRING EVENING IN 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Performance Gallery , in Seattle , looking very much forward to the premiere of a new dance by her youngest child and only son . Family and friends were all around . Mark told his mom that he needed some dolls for this piece , and Maxine had obliged , canvassing stores and picking out the sweetest ones : cuddly baby dolls with big eyes , plump diapered bundles with dimpled knees . <p> Lovey began , to the taped music of a band Maxine had n't heard of - the Violent Femmes . There were her dolls but oh , oh , dear . They were all naked and the dancers were doing unspeakable things to them . Mark 's choreography suggested pederasty . Sodomy . What were they doing with their tongues ? Oh , dear . <p> After the performance , a voice yelled from the audience : WASH THAT STAGE WITH ANTISEPTIC ! ' <p> I never did tell Mark , but I was mildly shocked , ' says Mrs. Morris now . In the first performance , I was probably sitting there with my mouth open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Maxine Morris is what her son calls a dance dignitary ' in Seattle . An energetic woman in her seventies , she has traveled the world to see her son 's company . But that night , with her jaw dropped halfway down her dress front , she was further shocked to hear the middle-aged woman behind her tell a friend , Oh , I liked it all , but my favorite was Lovey . ' The woman went on : It was about time someone gave serious treatment to the subject of child abuse . <p> Soooooo , ' says Mrs. Morris , that was a different viewpoint . ' <p> People find what they want to in her son 's work : pan-culturalism , neoclassicism , punk , dada . There were lots of people who actually liked Lovey . So it was n't that disgraceful . ' She laughs . And of course , it 's in to shock . I guess some people like that , and some people need it . ' <p> Her son 's earliest choreography was rarely outrageous , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a girl from the neighborhood to be this mermaid . She had to lie on top of the mantel . I made this giant mushroom with a fiberglass snow saucer on top of a garbage can . My brilliant effect was I put a desk lamp inside the garbage can so it was like this glowing giant mushroom . ' <p> He was about seven , one of those kids who was always hollering , Mom , Dad , WATCH ! ' Even before he began taking flamenco lessons at nine after seeing the Jose Greco troupe , he was fitting plastic cups on his feet , imitating his older sister who took ballet . I was always a ham . ' <p> He says he did n't do it to get attention . He just liked it . His first public performance was at the school district 's international night . He worked a tough crowd that had its mind on the ethnic-food tables set up in the lobby . With only seven farruca steps from Verla Flowers 's dance school and a homemade flamenco outfit , little Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother was not surprised . <p> He was perfectly at home , ' she says . He knew the stage was for him . ' <p> Besides , she says , ham dancing ran in the family . Mark 's maternal grandfather was a Montana rancher who used to mosey into Bozeman to pick up the latest vaudeville songs and dances . He was mad for tap and soft-shoe , tattooing the floor with his boots whenever a hotcha tune came on the radio . He turned the whole family into amateur , ginghamed vaudevillians . He hated ranching , Maxine recalls , and finally he moved his brood into town . This was swell with her - she was mortified by the rough , jigging cowboys at the barn dances . In Bozeman , she learned to tango and waltz , and then she headed west . <p> When Maxine moved to Seattle , she married a man who liked to play the piano . William Morris , a high-school English and typing teacher , taught his son to read music early . The whole family - Mark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on plays and made loopy home movies . Even the baked goods were a tad theatrical , like the birthday cake Maxine made for Mark in the shape of Mount St. Helens . She put rock candy on its slopes and jerry-built an eruption with dry ice inside and a sparkler on top . It was F-U-N , and no one loved it more than Mark . <p> He was always a good-natured person , ' says his mother . He had a lot of joy . Still does . ' <p> What is it , then , that makes him bugger baby dolls onstage ? What impulse led him to haunt Boston 's Combat Zone researching Striptease , which featured a six-foot-two dancer , Rob Besserer , buck naked except for his cowboy boots ? There are those who link the Morris kinks with Seattle 's dank and multiethnic climate . <p> Seattle is a weird place , ' says dancer Penny Hutchinson , who has been friends with Morris since she auditioned for a kids ' play he choreographed at the Seattle YWCA . He was fifteen ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Age city , going to high schools so diverse that WASPs were considered pale exotics , can give you a hodgepodge worldview , ' according to Hutchinson . She cites the area 's other over-thirty wackos : cartoonists Matt Groening , Lynda Barry and Gary The Far Side ' Larson , director David Lynch . Only that other port city Baltimore - which gave us John Waters , David Byrne and Frank Zappa - can hold a candle to Seattle in terms of twisted pop tarts . Pointing to the recent successes of shows like Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure , the New York Times even came up with a Cultural Catch Phrase : Northwest Noir . <p> Ask Morris about it and he shrugs , says it made perfect sense to young Mark that he should attend a high school of Samoans , blacks , Japanese and juvenile delinquents who were thrown out of Hong Kong , ' that he should study flamenco and hula as a child , then join a Balkan dance troupe as a teenager . He says he never gave much thought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class were Japanese . <p> This is not to say that the odd duck gets ignored out there . Mrs. Morris recalls that come September , her son did stand out among the tanned surfers in the school corridors . Summer theater projects left him as pale as skim milk . And though he says he was n't sure what he was then , kids were always saying things to Hutchinson about how effeminate her pal was . I never saw him that way , ' she says . He just seemed like Mark to me . ' <p> Morris will not admit to any great angst , no gnarly teen traumas . Mr. Loud could always crack up a classroom of thirty : I had a lot of close friends , and they were probably oddballs . I got myself through things because I was funny . I was a sissy , of course , to a certain degree . But I always sort of won , mouthwise . I was n't a pariah of any sort . I just did n't do a lot of things they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark attended , sometimes had difficulty with a teenage son who wore chartreuse pedal pushers and orange tank tops and long baggy coats from his favorite thrift shop , Value Village . I think his dad was afraid of him in a way , because of his femininity , ' Hutchinson says . Already Mark was such a distinct personality , he could n't control him . He disapproved of him , and I think that made Mark feel bad . ' <p> Nonetheless , it was a close family , one that suffered great shock when William Morris died suddenly of a heart attack . Mark was sixteen . His mother got work as a secretary , and Mark graduated high school early . At seventeen , he went to Spain to become - of course - a flamenco dancer . Watching Morris clack away among all those dark eyes and olive skin , his teacher called him Blanca Nieves - Snow White . From Spain , Morris wrote his mother a letter . I said , Oh , by the way , I 'm gay , ' ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Fine , whatever you want , I love you . ' I 'm sure she knew before I did . ' <p> That was settled , but his artistic hash was not . Young Blanca - an ardent purist then - decided that flamenco had been too bastardized . He returned to Seattle , where he and Hutchinson hung with the boho folk-dance underground and consecrated themselves to the Dance . They saw every troupe that came to town , took every workshop . They pored over Dance Magazine , saw films of the legendary ballerinas Plisetskaya and Ulanova . But mostly , they danced . <p> We 'd wander around Seattle Center , and they 'd have Big Band Night , ' recalls Hutchinson . We 'd go in and dance like we thought Twyla Tharp danced . We would enter a jitterbug contest and get third place - we could do some amazing lifts . We would crash high-school parties where there was a live band and dance until they kicked us out . ' <p> When the dance jones was really fierce , they even crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really soon , ' says Hutchinson . <p> <p> PENNY GOT TO NEW YORK FIRST , ' MORRIS RECALLS . She studied at Juilliard , then joined a succession of modern-dance troupes . When Morris arrived , they shared a grotty tenement apartment on the Lower East Side . Maxine Morris remembers the phone calls in those scuffling days . People were different there , more abrupt , ' she says . There was a lot of rudeness when he would try to audition . I think people recognized he had a lot of ability , and there were many people threatened by him . They were n't very nice . I think he met with that because he was so sure of what he wanted . ' <p> It was during his stint with the Laura Dean company that Morris met Erin Matthiessen , also with the troupe . He , too , was from Washington State . They fell in love on tour in New Zealand with Laura Dean . Half a world from the creaky , competitive lofts of the Manhattan dance scene , they could admit things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most SoHo bars . <p> I really like Loretta Lynn . ' <p> I do , too . ' <p> Mark confessed a taste for deep-dish Americana . Conway Twitty , Dolly Parton , Hank Williams , Lefty Frizzell , the Louvin Brothers . Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys . Wally and the Beav . Mark 's the corniest guy I know , ' says Matthiessen . <p> In 1980 , Morris started his own company . He could afford to rent space for only one or two performances a year , but the reviews were enthusiastic . Four years later , he and Matthiessen moved to Seattle for a respite from Manhattan cynicism . Recognition - in the form of a glowing review from The New Yorker 's esteemed Arlene Croce - came hours before they boarded the plane west to Seattle . A friend called and read the notice as their suitcases stood by , packed . The company would perform on both coasts , but home was Seattle . <p> In their tiny cottage , not far from Morris 's mother and sisters , even TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Lucy , Leave It to Beaver , Dobie Gillis and Father Knows Best , ' says Matthiessen . And by the time the music to Father Knows Best was starting , we were both in tears . ' <p> There were cookouts and sing-alongs with the Morris family . Mark is a total sucker for that early-Sixties myth of the American family , ' says Matthiessen . It 's a vision of America that he has . He loves old ladies who play golf on Sundays . He loves that his mother collects blue glass . He really loves those ordinary things about Americans that make Europeans crazy . ' <p> They lived together for four years , until , says Matthiessen , we split up because he became famous and I was not - sort of classic . ' Things were happening fast . As the accolades built up , the company grew stronger , with accomplished dancers like Penny Hutchinson , Tina Fehlandt , Ruth Davidson , Matthiessen and Keith Sabado . <p> Morris would also acquire a manager named Barry Alterman , a wise young man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer , a student at major-league umpire school and an ice-cream scooper at the Christopher Street Haagen-Dazs store in Manhattan . In those days , a Morris dancer needed a second and possibly a third job . Tina Fehlandt scooped pralines and cream alongside Alterman , and when the two moved in together in Hoboken , New Jersey , it was just down the street from Morris . They all hung out together , says Alterman , eating rice and beans in front of the quartz heater and watching Dynasty . ' <p> Alterman , an inveterate Deadhead so laid back you yearn to check his pulse , recalls the electrifying moment he knew his friend was hot stuff . In 1984 he and Fehlandt and a few friends went to Toronto to see Morris perform his own work . The tiny studio seated sixty at best . Alterman was perched on a radiator . <p> He did this solo , O Rangasayee , ' says Alterman . It was the first time he 'd done something without the veil of irony , no mediating humor , it was just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were screaming , ' says Alterman . Like Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ! ' ' <p> He thinks the solemn , moving piece came out of Morris 's being sick of his reputation as the funny choreographer , the enfant terrible . ' With that very adult performance came the frisson that most Morris devotees experience at some point . It blew me away , ' says Alterman . It was like I knew Verdi all of a sudden . ' <p> It was shortly after the Toronto performance that Alterman agreed to try managing the troupe . The office ' was an answering machine in Hoboken . Much of the time was spent filling out countless grant applications . Morris won a Guggenheim in 1986 with a project description that went something like this : I would like money to keep doing what I 'm doing . I love to make up dances . Love , Mark . ' <p> As the company grew , it always stayed family . ' Morris is well known for his loyalty to dancers and ca n't bring himself to fire someone who is n't working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . On the road they watch Jeopardy ! together , go out to dinner every night . But as the company grows up , he says , as younger dancers replace his old friends , there are naturally some pangs : I have times when I 'm lonely . In a hotel with a thousand people that are my responsibility . But there 's nobody home when I call the rooms to have a drink or something . ' <p> Now it is the younger dancers who keep him company into the wee hours . Paris would mark the final performances for Hutchinson and Matthiessen , his stalwarts of more than a decade . Morris is uncharacteristically closemouthed on the subject of their amicable but painful departures . Oh , it was time for Hutchinson . Twenty years of being friend , rock and muse is long enough . She sobbed hysterically when she told him , called it their divorce . ' Here in Paris , with only days to go , he still has n't talked to her about it . He 's out with the new kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's alone , he punches up the Seattle area code on those bleating Euro-phones to chat with the one he really loves . In Paris , as in every place Morris 's troupe performs , the program reads , in small type : Mark Morris would like to thank Maxine Morris and God . ' <p> Mrs. Morris says she does fret about her son . She just knew he was packing away too much cholesterol in Europe . She wonders how things will go back in the States . I think he has an awful lot of stress , and I wish that he would not smoke , ' she says . I wish that he 'd drink less - he was brought up in a family that was teetotaling . It does n't seem to faze him , but I 'm always afraid it 's all going to catch up with him . ' <p> Still , Mark had just been home and full of fun , organizing dances and sing-alongs with his nieces and nephew , banging on the piano . I was thinking he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . He just looked good , full of pep . ' <p> <p> IS IT SHARP AND STABBING - OR LOW-VOLTAGE throbbing ? ' <p> Morris is standing over one of his dancers who is grimacing , white-knuckling the barre . Sweat spatters the pristine mirrors in the theater 's rehearsal hall , where about fifteen of Morris 's dancers are taking his daily class , which is voluntary , hard , hot and a fair test of tender body parts . <p> Shower - massage - NOW , ' Morris orders . Do n't fuck yourself up worse . ' <p> As soon as the injured can cross the floor , class resumes . The stiff-backed pianist has been banging out martial cadences , but suddenly , the melody is making Morris scratch his head . <p> What is that ? ' <p> Archie Bunker , ' yells one child of the sitcoms , and indeed , they have been doing lovely , classic ronds de jambe and grands jetes to the closing theme for All in the Family . But in Morris works , even cartoony cadences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action , feel the floorboards buck , watch a pair of tall , muscled women rise , stretch and crack into an arabesque - toes pointed straight at your chest - and you will never say , as some of Morris 's critics have , that his work looks easy . And today it seems his head is working faster than anyone 's body can . <p> Whatsa MATTER ? ' he yells when a line of bodies fall out of his commands . <p> Too fast , ' a few gasp . <p> Morris puts down his cigarette and tries the move himself . <p> No shit . Sorry . ' <p> He uses bodies , other people 's bodies , when he choreographs . Earlier , I 'd work in the studio a lot by myself , ' he says . I made up everything on my own body . Then when I taught it to other people , it did n't work on them . In my head , I can figure out a floor pattern for twenty people with nobody running into each other . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody runs into each other , I work it out from there . So now I choreograph only in the room , right there . The stuff I work on alone is music stuff , shapes and ideas - like bar-coaster ideas . The actual step happens only in the studio . ' <p> Sometimes , this can be a bumpy ride . L'Allegro , says Hutchinson , is a joy to dance but was agony aborning . Dido was a dream . Most of Morris 's lifers ' agree that watching him make up a dance is the best clue to what he 's feeling about his ad hoc family . New Love Song Waltzes was such a piece . <p> Absent from class and from most of the performances this week is dancer Jon Mensinger , who has AIDS . He was diagnosed more than a year and a half ago , at about the time Morris was creating Waltzes . Mark knew , ' says Matthiessen . And he made up a section called Buddy Takes a Fun Ride . ' Buddy is his pet name for Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ultimately supported by them and helped to fly away . Until someone pointed it out to him , Mark had no idea what he 'd done . ' <p> Mensinger said he knew right away what the dance was about . But no one said much more . Mark can be the most generous person I know , and he can be extremely kind , ' says Matthiessen . Jon can miss rehearsals , or he can say , I wo n't be performing , ' and it 's okay with Mark . That 's a very generous act on the part of a big-dance-company director . ' <p> <p> THINK ABOUT IT , PEOPLE . AND DO LET 'S COUNT . ' <p> Morris , who is sweating , stands off to the side as two barres full of bodies get tangled in his commands . He tries the sequence himself , finds the spot where it 's most easily flubbed . This is good . Kinda democratic . Sometimes when he is not performing , as with L'Allegro , he can fall into a Mussolini mode . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that , ' he says . I 'm less nasty . ' And if he is snappish , if one too many of his brood asks the same question , he stands there like a schoolboy in front of the group and makes himself repeat over and over : I love and appreciate my beautiful dance company . ' <p> <p> OPENING NIGHT . TENTH ROW CENTER , there is a French girl in her early teens , hair pulled into a tight ballerina 's knot , a dance bag at her feet - clearly a classicist and as skinny as an haricot vert . As Morris 's dancers fly through the first segment of L'Allegro , the child shakes her head , whispers to her father something that translates roughly : These women like too much the Big Macs . ' <p> But as the dance progresses , as dancers become trees and plowmen and hounds and sprites , as dreadlocked Kraig Patterson dances a randy shepherd and Matthiessen spins like an autumn leaf caught in an updraft , she is more absorbed than scornful . She laughs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stupid Men 's Dance , ' a burlesque of male social conventions in which pairs of men alternately kiss , mince and slap each other on the butt , Chicago Bears style . At the end , when the company blossoms into a big , pulsing circle to Handel 's glorious noise , the girl is on her feet , bracelets clanging madly on her bony , applauding wrists . <p> In the wings , Morris is watching the beginnings of the curtain call - something he had to re-rehearse , a tad crankily , after the dress rehearsal . Thank God , they 're being neat about it now . The French are enthusiastic - a shade below thunderous but loud enough to goose the cupids on the mirrored ceiling . This is the same theater where Stravinsky premiered The Rite of Spring in 1913 and provoked an audience riot with his nasty primitive rhythms and unsettling dissonances . Such a lovely spot to land for a wild boy from the American Northwest . <p> Morris looks out at his company . There is a beaming young alternate whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just three performances to go . Jon is not out there - still too sick . As the applause builds , Morris hits the boards with the sassy , confident walk of a well-fed maestro . He is wearing baggy khakis and a pressed oxford shirt . With sweeping gestures , he calls up his tuxedoed conductor , his soloists . As the noise rolls over them , Matthiessen catches his friend 's eye , and he is startled . Silently , behind his smile , Mr. Loud is crying . <p> Photo : Morris <p> Photo : WHITE OAK PLANTATION , YULEE , FLORIDA , JULY 1990 : MORRIS COLLABORATED WITH BARYSHNIKOV 'S WHITE OAK DANCE PROJECT , A TROUPE THAT DANCES MOSTLY MORRIS . <p> Photo : " HE 'S AN OLD-FASHIONED CHOREOGRAPHER , " SAYS BARYSHNIKOV ( LEFT ) , REHEARSING WITH MORRIS AT WHITE OAKS PLANTATION .
