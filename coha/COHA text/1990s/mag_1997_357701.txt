The whole world had been waiting impatiently to hear what Bill Clinton would say last Wednesday  --  because the whole world would be affected . The President had promised four months ago at the United Nations that the U.S. would at last make a stand against global warming , the ominous trend that threatens the planet with climatic upheaval : melting glaciers , rising sea levels and more frequent and vicious storms . In December , 160 nations will meet in Kyoto , Japan , to forge a treaty to combat climate change , but until last week the U.S. refused to put its cards on the negotiating table . And without the forceful leadership of the U.S.  --  the most prolific producer of the " greenhouse " gases that are raising the earth 's temperature  --  any agreement designed to beat the heat would be futile . <P> That 's why , when Clinton finally laid out his plan from a podium at the National Geographic Society in Washington , so many people recoiled in dismay . The proposal Clinton described as " far-reaching " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide and other greenhouse gases to where they were in 1990 , but would not do so until sometime between 11 and 16 years from now . Yet back in 1992 the U.S. , along with most other countries , had signed a treaty committing industrial nations to such a rollback by the year 2000  --  a point not lost on delegates attending a pre-Kyoto planning conference last week in Bonn . " Disappointing and insufficient , " is how Cornelia Quennet-Thielen , head of the German delegation , characterized Clinton 's proposals . And the European Union issued a statement saying in part , " The U.S. proposal is for an even lower target than that proposed by Japan , which we already considered inadequate to tackle the problem of climate change . " <P> The Europeans had previously come out for a stricter standard that would cut emissions by industrial nations to 15% less than 1990 levels by the year 2010 . And in Bonn last week , the so-called G77 group of 77 developing nations , along with China , signed on to the European plan ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , even though their rapid industrialization and inefficient technology could eventually make them the world 's leading polluters ) . <P> If any country needs to take stronger action , it 's the U.S. While Europe has managed to reduce its emissions , American smokestacks and tailpipes are spewing greenhouse gases 8% faster than they were in 1990 . A Department of Energy study released last week showed that emissions jumped 3.4% in 1996 alone . At the same time , evidence of global warming 's dangers has continued to mount . When politicians started talking seriously about the problem in the late 1980s , the relationship between the proliferation of carbon dioxide and a warming world was largely theoretical . Scientists knew that CO2 and other gases trap the sun 's energy ; in fact , without any CO2 at all in the atmosphere , the planet would be frozen solid . The notion that extra , human-generated CO2 might drive temperatures too far the other way was convincing . But if warming was on the way , it was too gradual to be detected .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
