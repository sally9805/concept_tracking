MIKE TYSON IS LISTENING to a grain of exotic information about the king-cobra catchers of Burma ; he likes this kind of chat . " Say again ? " he asks . " I 'm going deaf . Maybe it 's all those years of listening to loud music . God 's own truth , I do n't hear too good . " He narrows his mail-slot eyes , leans in as if he were slipping a left hand . The cobra , so the story goes , rises to such a height that it often strikes the catcher 's head , where a tourniquet can not be applied . When that happens , it is said , go find the shade of a tree , sit back , and die like a man . It 's a metaphor , he is told , for his insidious punch , the power of his return to the ring after three years in prison . " Oh , " he says . His eyes fade , and he slumps back on his white battleship sofa . Hey , sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like snakes , or the idea of sudden expiration , say , in his fight against Frank Bruno . " I wo n't miss him as much as I did Buster Mathis , " he says softly , with a smile . The words suggest an interior expedition . He is aware that thick layers of ring rust will have to be scraped off with industrial energy . He is aware , too , that he must lower his ring rhetoric to bass ; no more " knockin " motherfuckers out is what I do " or " rammin " his nose up into his brain . " " Talking is n't my game , " he says in the living room of his Las Vegas mansion . " It pains me to think of what I used to say . A fighter 's power is n't his words . It 's fake . " " You have more power and are bigger than before prison . " " Power does n't interest me , " he says . " I do n't want power . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ? That 's going to surprise so many who think you do n't have one . " " Yeah . All those who expect me to be what they want . The Beast . " For someone who says he disowns the idea of power , Tyson is forced to look at his own every day in Las Vegas . When he goes into town , he has only to look up to see a forty-eight-foot rotating cube high above the MGM Grand Hotel with his sullen eyes peering down the Strip . When he returns to his home , a fountain plumes silvery over ornamental lions , and Mercedes limousines are parked like jets for takeoff . There is more security around him than in a precinct station ; it looks like a mob base camp , with people standing around outside , waiting for his smallest wish . Inside , others hover in wait for his next belch or sigh . After ordering a big pitcher of ice water , Tyson circles back to the king cobra . He says , " I would 've cut his fuckin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excuse me , the language . I like the dyin ' like a man . It 's my kind of thing . " He has a lot of " things " these days . He has a thing for tigers and lions . He has a thing for words like serious , stable , dignity , and pride . He has a thing for Islam . A thing for ancient Greece , a thing about legendary gangsters like Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel , who began in the same Brownsville neighborhood he once worked as a pickpocket . He has a thing about Wayne Newton , who lives next door , and his main thing is about being a man . He even has a thing about being a thing . " I do n't want to be perceived as a fighter anymore , just a violent thing , " he says . " I want to be seen as a man who is ferocious in life , will not be stopped . " Oh , my , is this going to be like talking to George Burns , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform in Mexico ? Where have you seen this tack from a fighter before ? Right , Muhammad Ali : Ask him about his craft and you 'd get an hour on movie westerns or broken-backed renditions of world politics . So many fighters have desperately wanted to flee what they do ; even a grim tradesman like Joe Frazier would emphasize his side career as a dissonant singer . Tyson can be extremely articulate , though , about his work , better than anyone before . Right now , however , he 's obdurate , clumsily evasive . When he does n't fancy an inquiry , his voice breaks up like a cloud into a mumble . " Are you bored ? " he is asked . " I 'm bored some with training . " He pauses . " I hate interviews , really hate them . I do n't want to be here . " He frowns . " Consider it a conversation . People want to know what 's on your mind . With all these millions , this comfort , they want to know if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " he says . " I 'm not supposed to have a mind . I 'm a monster . " He thinks . " Look , " he adds , " fighting to me is what theory was to Einstein or words were to Hemingway . Fighting is aggression . Aggression is my nature . " His eyes look away . " I do n't wan na talk about boxing . Do you like Hemingway ? I like his writing , but I do n't like him personally . Too much ego . " The cloud starts to become a wisp . So to pack it full of fleece again , you tell him a little story about ancient Greece . He likes the subject . He has a doorstop of a book on the Greeks in front of him . The Greeks , he is told , valued courage in a fighter . This one fighter , Eurydemus , had a heart full of it . He took a terrible blow to his mouth , uprooting his front teeth , but instead of spitting them out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was badly hurt . " Is that right ? " says Tyson . " That 's not in my book . That 's courage . Wow Like Wayne Newton . " Wayne Newton ? How did we go from the Golden Age of Greece to a Vegas singer ? " He lives right next to me , " Tyson says . " I wandered over , and we talked . I 'm not impressed by many people , but he impressed me . Ronald Reagan came to see him , was waiting for him in front of his house . The pope wrote him . Here 's a guy who started on the road when he was fifteen , had nothing , nearly starved , and became so big . He says , " Mike , I 've seen money and fame come and go , come back again and go again . Everybody falls . Just do n't stay down . And be very careful about people you trust . ' He 's supposed to be bankrupt now . You 'd never know it . The man is serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see big courage there . Dignity . " Tyson seems hungry for life lessons . He picks through examples as if he were strolling through a societal flea market . In antiquity , he finds and likes the realization that he is just a dust mite in the wind blowing across thousands of years . In reading about the old hoods , he finds that , compared with them , he was n't such a wretch in his more primeval days ; he was just a punk kid who could n't stand being who he was and sought the drunk in the alley , or the wallet , deftly pulled , of the guy on the bus to express himself . He is essentially a romantic , eternally dissatisfied with who he is , even now , in his cocoon of materialism , forever hacking through the thicket to some good and right evolution he can live with . His conversion to Islam is just one more hack . " Look , " he says , " I 'm not going to split the Red Sea . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I 'd like to go to the mosque , but I do n't . Muslims are human beings first , and knowing that , I know what they 'll be thinking . The signals will go off in their heads : Here comes the rapist , the thug , to defile their holy place . I ca n't allow exposure to that kind of thinking . But I go to the prayer rug every day . And now it 's Ramadan , a time for fasting for thirty days . I 've been doing it for four years . No food from sunup to sundown , then just enough for dinner , no pigging out . I love it . Look forward to it . I feel like a different man . It 's a high , makes you feel a little light-headed . " He found Islam in prison . Some think he sought out Muslims , a lethal , protective faction in many prisons , for personal security . " How ridiculous , " he says . " When I first went in , my hair started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiled , used to control . Well , screw him . It 's a hell , with people being robbed , assaulted , and raped and everybody applauding . It turned my stomach . People tried to attach themselves to me because I was Mike Tyson . They soon learned that I 'm a very unpleasant person to live with . " Tyson seems to like talking about the time he did in the Indiana Youth Center . He approached prison like a warrior , as if one of the Greek gods had assigned him a test of will . " I rebelled , " he says , " every chance I got . Guards harassed me , called me names . But I still rebelled . Never stopped , talked back . I did this for a reason . If the rest of the inmates saw me this way , they 'd rebel . If they saw me kneel , they would kneel , broken . Even people who did n't like me watched to see how I 'd deal with that kind of pressure . " He was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guard who 'd shoved him , the light on day and night , almost a complete deprivation chamber , which showed him that silence is the purest of sanities if you are strong . " I was going to make those guards respect me no matter what , " he adds . " You could 've been in there forever . " " I did n't care . I had no one to go back to . I thought I was a worthless human being . Sounds incredible . I could have done a lifetime there . I just did n't care . " " What about the Hole ? " " Ifyou want me to say it broke me , forget it . I was cool , just my head and me . I like being alone . I could 've done the whole trick there . It was the best time I did . " " Did you get a bad deal ? " " I did n't rape anyone , and she knows it . I was the one raped . I got fucked over , sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike . The prosecutor , Greg Garrison , was a shameless opportunist . He 's famous now , all over television . The judge , Patricia Gifford , well , I was her big moment . Twenty years from now , all she 'll be able to claim is that she put this famous nigger away . If I was guilty to twelve jurors , why did n't she give me the maximum , sixty years ? I hated everybody when I left prison . I was bitter . I wanted to blow up the world . No more . Hate wastes you away , man . " " What about your own lawyer , Vincent Fuller , when he said that everybody knows you 're an animal ? " " I was shocked , " he says . " I was devastated , absolutely devastated . It was worse than prison . The whole world heard that . Later , I just walked over to him and said , " Never come to see me again . I- ' ' " His head suddenly turns to a huge wall totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images combine into one massive picture . It is of O. J. Simpson conducting his defense , or offense , against public opinion . " I do n't wan na hear him , " Tyson shouts . The sound is immediately cut off . " This is an incredible individual right here . " You prepare for a declaration of confederacy here , a fusillade of deep sympathy . He scowls , then jerks his head away from the screen . The disgust is palpable . If he had popcorn , he 'd hurl it at the screen . Tyson can not tolerate being witness to what he senses to be weakness or an abdication of pride . " Cus D'Amato , Tyson 's founder and creator used to tell me about the Great Depression , " he says . " He told me about rich men jumping off buildings they owned because of pride . About rich men , now broke , who refused to get in soup lines because of pride . " He mimics Cus : " ' Ya hear , Mike ? They starved to death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that kind of pride ' ' " He continues : " What O. J. 's doing is sickening . The man has no dignity . The way he 's trying to win public opinion . That 's making him look very unstable . People like a vicious fighter in life . I 'm not saying O. J. 's a bad guy . Look at this He 's laughing . He 's not dealing with a situation that calls for that . I believe the more he keeps his mouth shut , the more it 'll go away . But he keeps bringing it up . God 's allowing this to happen . God 's planning to screw him . Go on . Keep talking . " He snaps his fingers , and the image of O.J. disappears , fades back into the checkerboard of televisions . He jumps up and says , " Let 's go play with my white tiger . His name is Kenya . Only seven months old . The lion , Omar , is n't here . He 's getting his nails clipped . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're solitary . They do n't need anyone . " " Lions ? " " They 're great family men . " " Do you see these things in yourself ? " " Maybe . " " Can they ever be joined ? " " Maybe never , " he says emptily . MIKE TYSON IS ENTHRALLED by boxing history ; he got that from Cus , too . He says that he admires the old fighters in the smaller weights , like Stanley Ketchel , the unruly cowboy who was shot in the back over a woman problem during breakfast . Secretly , though , he measures himself against the heavyweights of the past ; he wants the iconic futurity of Joe Louis , Rocky Marciano , and Muhammad Ali , the king of kings . As his old trainer Kevin Rooney says , " Cus , from the start , had Mike in with history . He was to be the greatest champion . The plan was to fight five times a year , smash Marciano 's perfect record , and go 55-0 . " Louis was the template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face of cathedral stone , short punches struck like unexpected rings from a bell tower , then stillness . He was a treasure to his people and among many whites , even while blacks were hanged from dusty trees . He spoke for the dispossessed , who listened to him on small radios in dark southern shacks , for the dignity of his race and the racial harmony that must one day come . Marciano  --  mute , a gluttonous eater of punches until he could detonate his own savagery . By his every word , he was the exemplar of the fifties : the tract house with the plot of grass , the new appliance . Ali shattered the matrix of the old champion . Boxing became verbal for the first time and visual like never before . " Be loud , be pretty , " he used to say , " and keep their black-hatin " asses in their chairs . " The television camera lingered greedily on the lines of Ali 's style and attitude . Though Ali was the memorable real thing , the most gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation 's racial rectitude , he was also the father of the contemporary ring , where the show , the microwavable event , is the intense focus , where mediocrity is made to look like quality by undiscerning media for an audience with a connoisseurship an inch deep . The unexamined part of Ali 's legacy is that he generated a whole line of babbling mimics and created a sport that has now become dangerously close to pro wrestling . There is a tendency to forge a narrative link between Ali and Tyson because of their exiles and religion . Ali in the first half of his career was detested , then immortalized ; the reverse is true of Tyson . And both men played with the fire of sex . The difference was the media reaction , when they looked at all . With Ali , it was considered cute ; with Tyson , it became menace . The most striking part of Ali as a fighter was his sense of ring geometry . His whole game was built on time and space ; he was a light show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what big men were supposed to be about . With the coming of Tyson , the ring returned to the dark heath . When you looked at him , you did n't see neon ; you saw the way the ring used to be decades earlier : the single light over the rubbing table , the backed-up toilet , and the cold shower . Tyson put you near small black-night fires where rocks and bones were being shaped into killing points , and thwacked the reptilian brain in all of us . He brought back the primal rush  --  men seizing the maleness of other men . As a presence , Tyson can be more closely linked to two other strange heavyweights : Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson , another Cus D'Amato production . He has the same grave aura , the same introspection as Patterson , except that Tyson has a winning , disarming castrato voice . To speak with Patterson was to be led through a psychic wood of mist , over topics like fear and courage . Often , you felt as if you were sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and souls looking for clarity in a suffusion of grayness . Liston presented an image of imminent danger and defiance . He went through life like a big rat in a familiar granary . He and Tyson share the same early jail pedigree , but they divide in the matter of conscience ; Liston had none ; Tyson seems to have found one . What hurls Tyson forward is more than other great heavyweights . It 's the old idea of the title , as pounded into him by Cus D'Amato . The title was mythic , tribal , an " office " like that of president . Indeed , when JFK called Patterson to the White House , he was n't looking for a photo op ; he was schmoozing with the constituency of the heavyweight title . " To be a champ then , " says Tyson , " meant something . That kind of respect is n't out there now . " Does he have a constituency ? " I just have myself , " he says . " And the memory of Cus . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Tyson , it 's clear , has a ghost for a manager . You can see a lot of D'Amato in Tyson ; the old man 's paranoia and bitterness can leak into Tyson 's head in a second . He was a spooky mystic and spoke once of how he would " put the look " on people on a bus , and they would feel it and turn toward him . " Cus is in my head , " Tyson says . " He knows . Others think they know ; they do n't . " OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW what 's left in Tyson 's head for the ring . What does he have left , if anything ? Kevin Rooney does n't think there 's much , though he qualifies his own feelings of betrayal . " When he came up and was knockin ' everybody over , " says Rooney , " he had 50 percent of the capability we wanted . In ' ' 87 and part of ' ' 88 , he was on the road to greatness . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary fighter . He 's rusty . Everything is wrong with him . Does n't jab at all now ; he 's not slipping punches . He still has hand speed and power but nothing in the head . " Teddy Atlas , a trainer who worked under Cus with Tyson , says , " He 's not the same fighter he was before . In his first return , there was a moment against Peter McNeeley . He could have dropped him . Instead , he grabbed him . Tyson likes to call himself a blood man . I did n't see any blood man . A blood man obliterates . Grabbing for guys  --  that 's a crack . But I do n't know if there 's enough guys to exploit it . " Atlas has no love left for Tyson , adding , " ne 's never had any character or discipline , and he 's manipulative . " Has he mellowed ? Atlas says , " Forget it . He 's a very incomplete man brought up by Cus , who was another emotionally incomplete man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to go to Eddie Futch , the finest trainer the ring has produced , with nineteen champions , six of them heavies . Says Futch , who now trains Riddick Bowe , " I want him still here for Bowe . I hope he has it back . But you just do n't know about his reflexes . When they leave , it 's subtle . A fighter knows what to do but ca n't do it . Tyson 's the kind of fighter who wo n't have much longevity . He expends so much energy exploding that not much is left after six rounds . It does n't make for a long career ; there 's too much waste of energy for a little man . Tyson ca n't relax in the ring . He 's always tight . " What kind of fighter can beat him ? " Tall men  --  they make him go more than six rounds . A puncher who can back him up . He 's never been backed up . We 'll see now . " Futch , now in his eighties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top five all-time ? " " No , " he says . " Louis had too much in either hand for Mike  --  short , deadly combinations that shake you to your shoes . With Ali , Mike would n't hit him with a hand grenade . Jersey Joe Walcott would 've been too smart for him . Liston was too big and powerful and had a jarring jab . Rocky would be hit , that 's for sure , but Mike would see violence in spades . " Which brings us to the hole in Tyson 's young legend . Tyson says he hates fame , " all those people screamin " and starin ' at you , " but he cherishes glory . Real glory comes from serious and gallant inquisition , when a champion is taken to hell and back by an opponent of certain merit who allows the champion to express his greatness . Louis had Max Schmeling and Walcott . Marciano had Walcott and Ezzard Charles . Ali had the full wagon of Joe Frazier two times ( do n't count the middle one ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destructive George Foreman , who had even Ali 's fans fearing for his well-being . Where is the glorious , defining series , Mike , the kinds of fights that exact your true worth and mettle , that leave people gasping with each shot , their hands clenched , their palms wet ? Has it hurt his psyche not to have this hombre a hombre ? " Can we talk about literature ? " he asks curtly . " Sure . " " You like Tolstoy ? He had me all screwed up in jail , made me want to give everything away . Tolstoy was a square . Dickens was n't . He knew villains and celebrities . His father did time in jail , and I believe , as he wrote : " I shall not forget . I will not forget . I can not forget . ' ' " He pauses . " You like Fizgerald ? " " Very much . The Great Gatsby . Especially the part about Tom and Daisy . How " they were careless people .... They smashed up things ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness ... and let other people clean up the mess they had made . ' ' " Tyson eyes you closely , then says , " I cleaned up my own mess . And the only wreckage I left behind was me . " " What do you think about women ? " He has been reported ready to marry Monica Turner , a pediatrician who is expecting his baby . " I love women , " he says . " I 'd be insane not to . I just wo n't love as deeply again . It 's dangerous for me . I 'm attracted to independent women , not the ones who try to devour you . " " Have you ever been a fool ? " " I 've been a fool , felt like a fool , and acted like a fool . I 've been through a lot of shit . I 've been humiliated in my first marriage . I 've been humiliated by girls who said I grabbed their butts . I 've been humiliated about being in prison . I 've lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tyson jumps off the sofa and bounds up the stairs . He is weary of talking , or maybe he 's suspicious of the excavation going on , the effort to get at what the master biographer Leon Edel called " the figure under the carpet . " The figure here is safe ; Tyson defies concreteness over a sprint . As he said earlier : " I have a serious thing going on between me and my head ; it 's just me and my head . " How this wicked duel will leave him is anyone 's guess . He could end up as a rare-book collector , a prophet with a long beard in the back of a limousine , or rolling on the grass with his children while the steaks sizzle , his violence long at bay and his inherent humanity in full restoration . Or ... well , let 's say there 's hope in a dream he 's always had , a dream in which he steps into the ring to fight Mike Tyson . He used to lose the bout , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be beaten . " How does the dream end now ? " I beat him every time , " he says . <p>
