<p> Linda O. Miller sells an unusual product . Her market is the parents of dead children  --  the miscarried , the premature , the infants who are taken by known and unknown ailments and leave behind an unanswerable anguish . <p> For these parents Miller offers the solace of tiny coffins . There may not be a body to put in them , just an idea . The littlest coffins are no longer than 12 inches , outfitted in white satin and lace . She has burial dresses the size of an adult hand , casket sprays accented with angels and doves that can be taken home as remembrances , and a funeral register decorated with baseball bats or dolls , with places for pictures or a lock of hair . <p> Miller , an embalmer at a Kentucky funeral home , does n't make any profit from her " Our Little Angel " line , she says . She lost three babies herself , she 'll tell you , and she just believes that people need these things . " How do you mend a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference on bereavement in Seattle . " By our intelligence , and by some of the supplies that we have to offer . " <p> While death itself has forever been both an economic and anthropological force , grief has only recently taken a place onstage . In a society that is increasingly confessional , what was once a private torment is now becoming a kind of commodity . Where some cultures meet the loss of loved ones with wailing lamentations or rent garments , ours has devised the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing , led by certified grief counselors paid with government funds . If your heart is broken , there is a support group for you somewhere , be it for young widows , unmarried partners , toddlers or teens . <p> Grief and the counseling for it have developed their own lingo , too . The talk is about healing , and finding closure . Grieving is a process , and grief is processed , before there can be any closure . Part of the process is nurturing , and validating a bereaved person 's experience . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encompasses all those who grieve , and those who nurture , validate and process . <p> Mourning has become an industry . <p> The Commerce Department , for example , contracted with 13 different agencies to provide 32 grief counselors for employees after last year 's plane crash that took the life of Secretary Ron Brown and 34 other people , most of them department employees . Over two months , a spokeswoman said , some 400 workers availed themselves of these services at a cost of $ 34,793.75 . <p> Colleges now offer majors in death and grief ( often under the more academic rubric of " thanatology " ) , and thousands of courses in " Death and Dying . " You can become a certified " death educator " after taking a course and passing an exam administered by the Association for Death Education and Counseling , which has more than 2,000 members . Its international conference begins here today , and hundreds are expected to attend . <p> More than 1,600 grief counselors and services are listed in the National Directory of Bereavement Support Groups and Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by subject . The headings alone are a grim catalogue of loss : " AIDS , Death of a Child , Organ Tissue Donation , Pet Loss , Vehicular Homicide . . . " <p> " When you send us more money , we can help more grievers ! ! ! ! ! " reads a fund-raising appeal from the Beverly Hills-based Grief Recovery Institute Educational Foundation , which says it counsels more than 14,000 callers every year on its Grief Recovery Hotline . The calls increase after the death of a celebrity , which for some people is apparently as painful as the loss of someone they actually know . <p> And if a call does n't help , perhaps its $ 1,800 four-day Grief Recovery Certification Program will . <p> You can bury a loved one in cyberspace in the World Wide Cemetery , and even leave cyber-flowers . You could also turn to the Griefnet to share your sorrow with others through e-mail , and give each other cyber-hugs . <p> There are more than 600 titles in the Library of Congress computer under the category of bereavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles from " Coping With the Loss of Your Pet " to " The Gendering of Melancholia . " These are but a fraction of the published material on grief  --  one smaller company , the Rainbow Connection and Compassion Books , lists 400 titles , such as " Healing and Growing Through Grief " and " Do n't Take My Grief Away . " <p> There are also dozens of speakers , such as Terry Tafoya , PhD , a Native American who brings to his workshops a drum and stories about Indian bereavement customs ( his fee : $ 2,700 a day ) , and Darcie Sims , known familiarly as " the Erma Bombeck of death , " who often carries brightly colored balloons ( her fee : $ 3,000 a day ) . They travel the country giving talks at meetings sponsored by groups like the World Conference on Bereavement , or the Parents of Murdered Children , or Compassionate Friends . <p> Then there are tapes . " Welcoming Grief with a Sense of Wonder ! , " for example , in which a man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cries , " which is about the death of his wife , Susan . He describes it as " a collection of poetry and prose that welcomes grief with open arms . " <p> Moving from the spiritual to the tactile , caring hospitals can purchase " certificates of life " for cases of miscarriage , stillbirth and neonatal death , or a " door card " to place on the hospital room door of bereaved parents to signal their loss . Funeral homes , looking to improve their image in the community , are offering " aftercare " as part of the burial package , including free open houses with refreshments around the " difficult holiday season . " Mourners can write their thoughts on a new casket being sold in Texas , which has a special plastic coating and comes with a set of indelible markers . <p> Companies and government agencies have been sending away for free brochures , available from hospice organizations , that tell you how to deal with a grieving colleague or employee . <p> " Your desire to be sympathetic should not keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Jim , I know this is a difficult time for you , but it 's hard for me to listen right now . Could we talk during lunch ? ' " <p> Death at a Distance <p> There is no simple explanation for the phenomenon of grief counseling and its related businesses . Experts point to a combination of demographics ( an aging population ) and advanced medical technology ( people living longer and dying in the hospital ) as part of the reason . Increased geographical mobility has helped remove death from ordinary family experience , as well ; Grandmother rarely dies upstairs anymore , nor is she laid out in the parlor before the funeral . <p> In reaction , the hospice movement has reintroduced over the last 25 years the notion that one could die at home , raising , for a generation anesthetized to death , difficult issues of how to deal with loss . Elisabeth Kubler-Ross , now ailing herself , is often cited as a pioneer whose advocacy on behalf of the dying led people in the field to work with those left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . In this New Age , we have become increasingly expert-dependent . Lacking experience or role models  --  even among the clergy  --  people feel inadequate to the task of dealing with overwhelming emotion , and turn to the trained guide for a road map . Somehow , we think , the inexplicable will be explained and untamable sorrow resolved . Surely , we reason , we need something more than time to heal . <p> " People are now examining the subconscious cultural message that death is ' bad , ' " wrote Lynne Ann DeSpelder and Albert Lee Strickland in " The Last Dance : Encountering Death and Dying , " one of the more respected textbooks in the field . <p> " America does n't really experience death today as it did years ago , " said Kathleen Frisina , a grief counselor with the Hospice of Metropolitan Erie in Pennsylvania . " Now we use hospitals and funeral homes and put the elderly in nursing homes . Children are removed . If our children have never experienced a death , they look to us as role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sad and cry . It is all part of life . " <p> There are other factors . Catastrophic death has been brought , via television , into our living rooms  --  albeit at a remove . The Challenger disaster , Hurricane Hugo , the Oklahoma City bombing , the crash of TWA Flight 800 , the latest vile murder  --  vicariously experienced death surrounds us without relief . The AIDS epidemic , with its youthful victims often estranged from family and society , spurred activism among the bereaved , along with an almost overwhelming need to memorialize the dead . Hospices seeking Medicare payments are required to offer bereavement services to survivors , for which they are not reimbursed and which they must raise funds to support . Funeral homes have found that offering bereavement services is good for business . <p> The death market is not likely to disappear soon . Of the 2.3 million people who die every year , 1.2 million leave a spouse behind . And that does n't count children , friends or other loved ones who then enter the bereavement community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish between a genuine counselor and an opportunist . There is no doubt that many grief counselors have helped people in real and enduring ways . <p> Kenneth J. Doka , a gerontologist and Lutheran minister who is a grief consultant for the Hospice Foundation of America , recalled that when President Kennedy died he was 15 and deeply upset , but there was no way for him to acknowledge his feelings . " They announced it over the school loudspeaker and that was it , " he said . His son 's experience 23 years later , when the Challenger exploded , was entirely different . " They immediately sat the kids down , talked about it , and later planted a tree or something . There was real sensitivity to the needs of individual students . " Not doing that , he says , can " complicate people 's resilience " in responding to traumas later in life . <p> But others say the move toward grief therapy and counseling is yet another effort to turn natural human instincts into products and self-perpetuating institutions . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodification of community life , of making the functions of community into negotiable instruments that are bought and sold , " said Robert McKnight , director of community studies at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University . " Pretty soon the grief counselors will say there 's just too much grief out here , we need more tax money to deal with it , and the policymakers will say we ca n't afford to process all the grief . " <p> McKnight sees the grief counselor as a metaphor  --  not for the health of society , but for the weakening of community , another way of removing our sense of responsibility for each other . Soon , he argues , no one will bring over a casserole when a neighbor dies , because everyone will assume the grief professionals are taking care of everything . <p> " The so-called grief therapy expert assigned to me went into his act , " wrote Susan Cohen last year in a Time magazine " Viewpoint " column in which she recalled losing her 20-year-old daughter in the terrorist bombing of Pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had good memories to comfort me and could look to the future with hope . He started barking questions at me about Theo . . . . I told him to leave me alone . My grief was the grief of Greek tragedy , his response the verbal junk food of psychobabble . My husband , sunk in his own grief , told the ' expert ' to leave . He refused . My husband had to threaten to grab him by the neck and throw him out . " <p> But Cohen and McKnight are skeptics in a new world of believers . The therapy proponents argue that there will be charlatans and incompetents in any enterprise , and the attention now being paid to bereavement does far more help than harm . <p> " We romanticize the past , " said Stephen P. Hersh , director of the Medical Illness Counseling Center in Bethesda . " There were wonderful communities , but there was also a lot of loneliness and isolation . In this scary age of information overload and shifts in families , people seek ways of restabilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a business out of it . " <p> There are numerous organizations that aim to serve in a responsible way , including the many nonprofit hospice centers , community mental health centers and hospitals . Indeed , few people seem to be making a huge profit out of the grief business . But , as McKnight notes , there is increasing evidence of new layers of bureaucracy , each requiring a certificate earned from another institution , another course or training weekend , another self-perpetuating level of expertise . A new branch of counseling , for example , is developing to help the counselors themselves deal with burnout and " compassion overload , " and yet another expands the grief counselors ' purview to include any kind of loss , from job to lover to a beloved apartment . <p> Learning to Grieve <p> The fundamentals taught in grief counseling sound simple : Be a good listener . Let the bereaved " tell the story , " as many times as necessary . Learn to recognize signs of serious mental unhinging  --  threats of suicide , for example . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieve in his own way . Do n't expect children to have long attention spans . Do n't force them to look at a dead body . <p> Some trainers offer the " wreath of grief , " or the " five fingers of grief , " to illustrate stages of emotional change , others the " six R 's : read , react , release , reach , realign , realize , " or " the ABCs of saying ' dead . ' " There are brochures that list things you could say to someone recently bereaved , like these suggestions from the National Hospice Organization : <p> I am sorry to hear about your loss . <p> I heard about your loss . I do n't know what to say . <p> And what not to say : <p> I know just how you feel . <p> It was God 's will . God never gives us more than we can bear . At least she is n't suffering . <p> At least you have another child . <p> You 'll get over it . <p> The American Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffed almost entirely by volunteers . There are 240 chapters around the country , based on the concept that only the widowed can understand what another widowed person is feeling . One of the largest local groups is in Northern Virginia , with a mailing list of 4,000 and an extensive menu of activities designed to offer solace to the newly bereft . <p> " The most wonderful cure for widowers is the potluck dinner , " organizer Audrey Markham said . " The men always bring a bottle of wine and $ 5 because they do n't know how to cook . The women bring the food . " <p> There 's a potluck almost every Saturday night for the newly widowed and volunteers who have taken the one-day training seminar . Volunteers are taught to listen , and never to go to someone 's home , and that the AARP is not a dating service . They maintain a " warmline " for callers , hold monthly meetings , offer a round of talks about money and cooking , and organize " bridge bunches , " " lunch bunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I ca n't believe the way this is exploding , " Markham said . " I can get 30 calls a day . " <p> Another type of counseling is offered in Fairfax , which has a part-time grief counselor on the mental health payroll , for $ 28,000 a year . When county budget cutters threatened to cancel the program , every supervisor got a video of heart-wrenching testimony from widows and children who said they could not have survived their loss without the help of counselor Helen Fitzgerald and her volunteers . After the " Fairfax Grief Coalition " showed up at a budget hearing , the program was saved . <p> " You have so many people saying , ' Do this , ' ' Do n't do this , ' " said one of Fitzgerald 's fans , Marilyn Baird , whose husband died suddenly in January 1995 at age 49 . " She said there is no right , no wrong in dealing with grief . It made me take a deep breath and deal with it in my own way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified grief educator and counselor , entered a hotel conference room wearing a bright red clown suit . She was leading a workshop called " I Could Die Laughing : The Humor of Death and Dying " at the World Conference on Bereavement in Seattle last year . She urged her audience to " bring your inner toddler out " in order to understand the spirit of her talk on finding the humor in death . <p> She stripped off the clown garb to reveal a black suit , put on a black cape with a skeleton on the back , then added a halo and black gloves . She tried out some death jokes . <p> " What 's the best thing about being 103 ? To tell the truth , there 's no peer pressure . " <p> The gathered grief professionals laughed . Nearby , in an exhibit hall , there were more than 50 enterprises on display , such as the company that makes weather-resistant picture frames for graves , and glass sculpture " companion star " memorials to " celebrate your timeless companionship , " available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo " were " healing puppets , " priced from $ 5 to $ 160 . Another booth offered pictures of " The Book of Remembrance , " made with " medieval techniques of calligraphy and gold leaf , " for funeral homes to create " a self-perpetuating profit centre which increases as it is embellished with memorials . " <p> Stark , a small , spunky grandmother who lives in Miami , had been among those called to the scene of the ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades . She 's seen enough death and grief to be able to laugh at it , and at herself , she said . Later that day , while her colleagues gripped plastic cups of white wine at a reception , she acknowledged some ambivalence about the business she is in . <p> " I hope one day there will be no need for us , " she said . " But we 're not there yet . "
