Here 's the state of the economy in the typical U.S. household : the principal breadwinner ( let 's say it 's a he ) brings home the same paycheck he was bringing home in 1970 , when Richard Nixon was President and the Grateful Dead had hair . He may think he 's got raises , but when you subtract for inflation , he has n't . Yet his family is better off than it was in 1970 , with 20% more buying power . <P> What 's the reason the typical household has more money to spend , while the typical paycheck has failed to grow ? There 's now a second breadwinner in the house . Couples have also let up on babymaking ( the rate dropped from 18.4 births per 1,000 people in 1970 to 16 in 1992 ) , so there are fewer mouths that need braces and not as many teenage phone bills to finance . More workers with fewer dependents makes for more income per family . <P> The above analysis comes from Frank Levy , an M.I.T. economist and expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians are rushing to the aid of a vanishing middle class that is n't really vanishing . While there has been a big drop in the number of families making $20,000 to $40,000 a year , it has been offset by a sizable increase in the number of families making $50,000 to $90,000 . <P> The two groups that have been helped most in recent decades are senior citizens and rich people . At one time , the elderly sat alongside small farmers on the poverty rung of the economic ladder , but they 've been pushed up by rising Social Security benefits . President Nixon deserves much of the credit for this . Before he came along , Social Security payments were raised only when Congress decided  --  usually around election time  --  to give retired voters a bonus . Since Nixon put in the automatic cost-of-living increase , the surest way to improve your lot in life is to get old . <P> According to Ed Wolff , an N.Y.U. economist who tracks wealth , the very rich have improved their lot in life by getting richer . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population ) now own 39.3% of all assets ( stocks , bonds , cash , life-insurance policies , paintings , jewelry , etc . ) . This makes the U.S. No. 1 among prosperous nations in the inequality of income . <P> Wolff 's statistics on the distribution of wealth during the Reagan years are particularly stunning . He calculates that the nation 's net worth increased from $13.5 trillion to $20.2 trillion during the rewarding years of 1983 to 1989 , and that $3.9 trillion of the reward was captured by the fortunate top one-half of 1% . That works out to a $3.9 million bonanza per wealthy household . Wolff says the last time the national assets were so unevenly distributed was in 1929 , just before the stock-market crash . <P> The biggest losers of the latest quarter-century are the people who did n't go beyond high school , particularly the men . They are the only group that has less money to spend now than it did in 1970  --  more than $6,000 dollars less in inflation-adjusted annual income . Back in 1970 , a high-school diploma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice car in the driveway and a house in the suburbs . Today all it gets is a clunker parked on the street and a dingy apartment in a low-rent building .
