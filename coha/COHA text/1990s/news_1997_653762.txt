<p> MORE than any other factor , performance sells mutual funds . That puts start-up funds , with no performance record , at a disadvantage in the battle for investors ' dollars . <p> To give the start-ups a booster shot , a growing number of fund companies are following an old strategy that allows a new fund to build a performance record even before it starts to solicit money from the public . <p> The practice , known as incubation , has been applied in various forms over the years by many fund companies , including giants like Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments , in testing new types of funds . But increasingly , it is being adopted by smaller fund complexes like Van Kampen American Capital , State Street Research and Management , and Van Wagoner Capital Management , looking primarily for top performers to market aggressively . <p> Seeded with a few hundred thousand dollars from a fund company and its insiders , and operated initially out of the view of performance-hungry investors , a small new mutual fund might be able to generate returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rankings . Those returns can be artificially high because an incubating fund generally does not allow redemptions by shareholders . Fund companies are then able to market that performance to the public , stepping through a loophole in Government regulations that restrict similar actions by private investment pools . <p> Consider the State Street Small Capitalization Value fund , which gained a stunning 57 percent last year  --  better than all but three mutual funds in the country . Although it had been approved for sale in February 1995 by the Securities and Exchange Commission , the fund took in only about $1 million  --  out of a total of $12 million  --  from investors outside of the State Street fold in its first two years . <p> Few investors knew about the fund because State Street spent two years incubating it , nurturing and building a record that would stand out from the crowd  --  something much easier to do with a tiny fund . Earlier this month , State Street " introduced " the fund , renamed State Street Aurora , to the public with a splashy marketing campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulators , while refusing to discuss any specific funds , are paying close attention to the resurgence in incubation techniques . " It certainly raises concerns about how performance is used " to market new funds , said Barry P. Barbash , director of the S.E.C. 's division of investment management , which regulates mutual funds . Foremost among those concerns , Mr. Barbash said , is whether a fund that compiles a rich performance record while it is small will be managed in the same way once it starts soliciting money from investors and grows larger . <p> The incubating trend gives investors even more reason to be cautious about new funds . If , for the average mutual fund , past performance is no guarantee of future results , it is even less so for a fund that is just emerging from incubation . Big fund companies in particular have resources that could letthem support an incubating fund in ways that are all but invisible to investors and that might greatly affect performance . After incubation , and as investment money comes pouring in , the fund might curtail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on performance . <p> The incredibly strong gains of the stock market over the last two years have provided the perfect environment for the fertilization and incubation of hot-performing new funds , said A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services , a fund tracking company . " Incubation tends to be a bull-market phenomenon , and you tend to see them in good markets for initial public offerings . " <p> Big fund companies enjoy an advantage in such a market because they have the buying power to get scarce shares in hot I.P.O. 's . If a company allocates those shares to a small fund , they can have a big impact on performance . <p> " That 's not just skating close to the line , that 's arguably going over it , " said Burton Greenwald , a fund industry consultant in Philadelphia . " It 's really not fair to take a million dollars and , having the clout to command allocations of hot issues , build a record that bears no relation to the real world or what will be the experience of average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look no further than the country 's biggest mutual fund , Fidelity Magellan . It was incubated for 16 years before opening its door to the public in 1981 . While Fidelity allowed investors into the fund from 1963 to 1965 , it closed the doors afterward because of a lack of interest . Magellan was an also-ran among Fidelity funds until the late 1970 's , when the manager , Peter Lynch , started to attract attention with enormous returns . <p> Investors then clamored to get in , but no one outside Fidelity was allowed to join until 1981  --  in part because big tax losses accumulated by the fund , and coveted by the insiders who owned shares , had not yet been exhausted . <p> Once the fund opened to outside investors , assets shot up , to $1.6 billion at the end of 1983 from $107 million two years earlier . Although the fund remained near the top of the fund rankings for many years , it never surpassed its performance of 1980  --  its last full year of incubation  --  when it gained 70 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 37 percentage points . <p> PUTNAM , the nation 's sixth-largest fund company , makes incubation a common practice , and has about six funds in incubation right now . Putnam 's method involves registering a new fund for sale only in its home state of Massachusetts and marketing it only to its own employees and those of its parent , the Marsh &; McLennan Companies . <p> That usually leaves a new fund with less than $10 million in assets , which allows Putnam to test management techniques . Because it is registered , the fund also compiles a performance record that can be used if the firm decides to sell the fund to a broader audience . And if the performance record is good , it usually does so . <p> A recent devotee of incubation is Garrett Van Wagoner , who heads Van Wagoner Capital Management in San Francisco . This year , with the four small-cap funds he manages badly trailing the broad market , he decided to incubate two new funds emphasizing large-cap stocks . <p> " It became obvious we would be stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Van Wagoner said . " So we decided to open them with seed capital and work on our investment process and procedures . When the time is right , we 'll be selling a good product . " <p> While the S.E.C. has taken several looks at the incubation process in recent years , its rulings have mainly focused on one particular type of incubation : when a company tries to convert an unregistered investment pool into a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , bringing along the performance record of the private pool for use in marketing the public fund . <p> In April 1986 , the S.E.C. allowed the Growth Stock Outlook Trust , a closed-end fund , to use in marketing materials its performance for periods before its designation as a public fund . Similarly , in September 1995 , the S.E.C. allowed Mass Mutual Institutional Funds to use the performance of unregistered separate accounts after cloning them and registering the clones as mutual funds . <p> The past performance data were allowed because Mass Mutual was able to show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it unlikely that they were established simply to generate a short-term record of hot performance , Mr. Barbash said . In addition , Mass Mutual vowed that once the new funds were sold to the public , they would be managed in the same way as the previous separate accounts . <p> In that situation , " it 's hard to argue that the past performance information would not be useful , " Mr. Barbash added . <p> A letter on the subject of incubator funds , written in February by Jack W. Murphy , chief counsel of the S.E.C. 's investment management division , makes clear what fund regulators will not permit : the setting up of several unregistered funds to gather performance records , only the best of which would then be marketed to investors as the " past performance " of a new mutual fund . ( The letter was in response to a New York University finance professor who inquired about the subject . ) <p> In such a case , Mr. Murphy stated , " incubator fund performance should not be included in a mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining the sponsor 's purpose in establishing the incubator fund . " As is common practice , the letter was recently made public by the commission . <p> The rulings spell out the staff 's position regarding the conversion of unregistered investment pools to public mutual funds . But they say little about what has emerged as the more common practice of fund incubation  --  that is , when a company operates registered mutual funds but limits their availability directly or effectively , by a lack of marketing . <p> THAT 'S what State Street Research and Management and Van Kampen American Capital have done recently . Each took a fund that had been operating out of the public eye for a year or more and , after it put together a year high on the charts , promoted the fund to the public in a full-scale marketing effort . <p> State Street , which boldly introduced the Aurora fund after it gained 57 percent in its second year of operation , bristles at the suggestion that the fund was incubated . Troy Shaver , an executive vice president at State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund at all . " It was available to the public , " he said . " We just did n't market it . " <p> In addition , he said , " our decision to start marketing the fund now had nothing to do with its performance in 1996 . " The company did not publicize the fund from the beginning , he said , because State Street 's institutional clients had asked the company to restrict its total investments in small-cap funds to $750 million . Virtually all that capacity was taken up by institutional money and a $75 million small-cap growth fund started in 1993 , leaving no room for another fund geared to individual investors . <p> Now , Mr. Shaver said , State Street has done away with the capacity restraint and is simply telling the public about the fund . But if the fund was previously available to the public , investors were unlikely to find out about it . The fund was not included in any daily newspaper mutual fund listings . As a result , less than 10 percent of its $12 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and its parent , Metropolitan Life Insurance . <p> Van Kampen took a somewhat different tack . The Van Kampen American Capital Growth fund was one of four the company started in December 1995 . The others were named Value , Prospector and Great American Companies . Don G. Powell , chairman of Van Kampen , said the funds were intended to fill holes in the company 's lineup . <p> The funds , capitalized with $100,000 each from Van Kampen , set out to invest on Dec. 27 , 1995 , each under the direction of a different manager . All of the funds were closed to outside investors . The Growth fund quickly outpaced its peers , gaining 62 percent by the end of 1996  --  making it the best-performing general equity fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services . ( The only fund performing better was the State Street Global Resources fund , a specialty energy fund . ) <p> The other three managed to put together good , but less stellar , performances ; each gained 28 to 30 percent , outpacing the broad market . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund suggests that investments in companies that went public last year contributed more than one-third of the fund 's gains . That calculation is based on the 15 stocks that went public in 1996 and that showed up in the fund 's shareholder report as of June 30 or Dec. 31 , and assumes that each of those investments was made at the stock 's initial offering price . <p> The three other start-up funds had far fewer I.P.O. 's  --  no more than a couple in each portfolio . <p> To be sure , the four funds have different investment objectives , which could account for the disparity in I.P.O. 's . Mr. Powell said that while new offerings did contribute a certain amount to the Growth fund 's performance , " we were n't just running I.P.O. 's through there . " <p> BUT if the four Van Kampen funds had been private pools rather than registered mutual funds last year , the S.E.C. probably would raise questions about the markedly different performances , particularly in light of Van Kampen 's recent decision to take only one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With each of the four new funds beating the S. &; P. 500  --  a feat accomplished last year by less than one in five stock funds  --  Van Kampen would seemingly have good reason to offer all of them to the public . But only the top-performing Growth fund was offered for sale , beginning in early February . <p> Last Friday , with assets approaching $100 million , Van Kampen closed the Growth fund to new investors . Virtually the entire amount was raised in roughly six weeks  --  an impressive feat undoubtedly related to the fund 's strong performance record . <p> IN fact , Mr. Powell said , one purpose of incubating the funds for a year was to do just that . " It 's hard to get brokers interested in a fund without a record of at least a year , " he said , and broker interest is paramount to Van Kampen , which sells its funds only through intermediaries rather than directly to the public . <p> Mr. Powell also said that the company 's decision to offer only the Growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in growth funds in general as on that fund 's record . The other three funds , Mr. Powell said , might be offered to the public next year . <p> S.E.C. officials declined to comment specifically on the Van Kampen situation . But speaking generally , Mr. Barbash said that it would be difficult to prove that the purpose of incubating multiple funds was simply to generate one good performance record and offer that fund to the public . Arguably , he said , a fund company could show that it was a good time to offer a fund with a particular investment objective to the public and not the others . <p> For investors , then , incubators pose a special hazard . While an incubated fund 's total return may be accurate , sustaining such a performance may be difficult when there is a deluge of new money or when investors are free to redeem their shares at will . <p> Disclosure , too , is spotty . Nowhere in the prospectus for the Van Kampen Growth fund , for example , does it say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance record , or that the other three had not performed as well and were not being sold to the public . <p> Given the S.E.C. 's concern with the incubation of private investment pools , mutual fund investors would be wise to pay close attention to newly offered funds with sterling performance records . If such a fund was kept hush-hush for a while and then thrust into the limelight , prospective investors would do well to ask why it was not promoted to them earlier and whether it can reasonably expect to turn in impressive numbers at its new size . <p> Graphs : " Van Kampen American Capital Growth " shows the cumulative total returns for Van Kampen American Capital 's four incubated funds in 1996 .
