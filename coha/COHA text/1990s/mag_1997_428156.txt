Approriations have not kept with park visitation and expansion . Faced with shifting priorities and growing maintenance backlog , the Park Service is struggling to make ends meet . <p> IT IS SPRINGTIME , 2010 , and you and your family are exploring the timeless mystery and wonder of the Grand Canyon . As you approach the rim , you pass under two familiar golden arches that say , " Welcome to McDonald 's Grand Canyon National Park . " <p> A far-fetched scenario ? Probably . Based on reaction last year to the idea of corporate sponsorship of national parks , it is highly unlikely that Congress or the public would allow such blatant commercialism in some of our country 's most sacred places . But the fact that corporate sponsorship did work its way into legislation last year , and continues to be discussed , illustrates how serious the problem of funding national parks is , especially with the drive to balance the federal budget by 2002 . <p> With that search for money comes a host of questions and issues about Congress ' annual appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be focused , and how park officials can pursue other funding options without jeopardizing their stewardship role . <p> Every year , the National Park Service ( NPS ) submits a budget request to the Department of Interior for approval . It then goes to the Office of Management and Budget before being sent to Congress as part of the president 's budget . In fiscal 1997 , the Park Service requested $1 .5 billion . Congress allotted $1.42 billion : $1.15 billion for operations ( nearly 74 percent of the budget ) ; $170 million for construction , $54 million for land acquisition , $38 million for national recreation and preservation ; and $36.7 million for historic preservation . <p> For fiscal 1998 , the agency is seeking $1.6 billion . The 1998 budget includes an ambitious project , the Everglades Restoration Fund , which would receive $100 million for scientific research and land acquisition to improve the vitality of the ecosystem in and around Everglades National Park . Congress and President Clinton agreed to a 1998 budget , but how the parks will fare is a matter of conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a matter of perspective . Although actual dollars appropriated have steadily increased , from $900 million in 1984 to $1.4 billion in fiscal 1997 , John F. Thornton , senior legislative representative for NPCA , says that over the last 15 years the agency has suffered a 14 percent decrease when funds are counted in constant 1983 dollars . <p> With the actual dollar increase has come increased responsibility and increased land-management challenges . Visits have steadily risen ( 210 million in 1984 , up to just more than 260 million in 1996 ) . The number of parks also has increased from 335 in 1984 to 374 today . In the last five years , staff has been cut by more than 10 percent , and salaries for remaining staff  --  long lower than for other federal agencies with comparable responsibilities  --  have increased slightly . <p> So even though it may look as though the Park Service is making out " better than other land-management agencies , " as one minority staffer of the House Appropriations Interior subcommittee observed , " they do not seem to be making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Service 's inability to " make ground " vary , and depend on in which quadrant of Washington , D.C. , one 's office is located . Advocacy groups blame Congress , Congress blames NPS , and NPS stays conspicuously out of the blame game . <p> And even though lawmakers may be giving the parks more money , they are also earmarking more of it for their priorities , not the agency 's . This fiddling usually happens with construction dollars first , says Eileen Woodford , NPCA 's Northeast regional director . <p> " Say the Park Service submits ten projects as top priorities for construction , and a congressman decides , ' I want to see a new visitor center in the park in my district , ' " Woodford says . " It 's always going to happen . It 's just how do you keep it in line , and how do you make sure these projects are not really damaging to the resources . " <p> Park officials are reluctant to offer specifics about these " add-ons " unwilling to bite the congressional hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularly has become known as " park pork . " <p> In NPCA 's 1998 budget summary , the association includes a chart of requested construction projects versus congressionally funded projects between fiscal 1985 and 1997 . In 1985 , for example , NPS requested $61.7 million for 16 projects ; Congress appropriated nearly $93 million for 30 projects . The biggest disparity was in fiscal 1992 : $84 million was requested for 22 projects , and Congress appropriated $217 million for 87 projects . <p> Even though the figures show that NPS is getting more money than it requests , the funds may be going to pet congressional projects rather than projects the Park Service earmarks . In 1992 , $ 13 million went to Steamtown , a museum in Scranton , Pennsylvania , before the site was part of the National Park System . And in 1991 , the budget included the $4.5 million restoration of a west Virginia movie theater . <p> When Congress earmarks money for its own projects , other higher priority Park Service projects do not get funded , says Bill Chandler , NPCA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park Service selection system chooses the right projects , every time one of those gets bumped , the critical intervention time may have passed and it may cost more in the long run because a leaky roof did not get fixed . " A Question of Priorities <p> But the problem is not just the legislators who are working to get a piece of the budget pie for their home districts . The Park Service itself does not always have its priorities clearly stated . <p> " The agency is spending less than 10 percent of its budget on resource management , and this is supposed to be the No. 1 priority job of the National Park Service , " says Dave Simon , NPCA Southwest regional director . " Nowhere in the law does it say there has to be a visitor center everywhere , nowhere does it say we have to have perfect office space for all the staff , that we have to repave all the roads . But it does say preserve the resources unimpaired . " <p> NPS also hurts itself when it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed information on how it intends to spend its money . Both Democrats and Republicans agree that the Park Service budget is difficult to understand and because of this , legislators become suspicious that money is not being spent efficiently . <p> " Republicans in particular ... have said , let 's stop spending all this money on land acquisition , on building facilities , on Washington bureaucracy Let 's really focus on putting money into parks , " says a majority subcommittee staffer . <p> Of course , putting money into the parks is exactly what the Park Service would love to do , but decades of insufficient funding have left a backlog of repairs and improvements . ( Estimates range from $6 billion to $8 billion . ) <p> " Congress does not maintain a capital budget where there 's a specific amount of funds targeted to keep the infrastructure in repair , " Chandler says . " It 's much easier to create a national park and much sexier than it is to maintain and fix what 's there . There is a lot of infrastructure out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Search for Funding <p> Though the debate will rage over flaws in budgeting , appropriations , and priorities , everyone agrees on one thing : The parks need more money . But where and how far to go to find it raises a lot of other questions . One of the most important addresses whether in its quest for cash , the Park Service is in danger of compromising its stewardship role . <p> " With this dilemma of budget crunches in times of increased demand , new ways to fund the parks are being examined by all sides , " says Rep. Bruce Vento ( D-Minn. ) , a senior minority member of the House Resources Committee . " Areas of agreement exist , but in many of these ' solutions ' the priorities and mission of the National Park System are not taken into account . Eliminating the cancer by killing the patient is not a viable option . " <p> To keep the patient alive , Congress last year approved a three-year pilot program to increase entrance fees at 100 parks . Nearly all of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimated $48 million for repairs and maintenance . This year , Congress is looking at : <p> Concession reform legislation . NPCA says studies show NPS receives an average 2 percent return from concessions , private businesses operating within the parks , when states and other entities receive at least 12 percent from businesses operating in their parks . Thornton says conservative estimates are that concession reform could generate $50 million annually ; <p> A revenue bond program that would let private , nonprofit groups issue bonds to finance capital parks projects ; and <p> A bill that would let taxpayers check off part of their tax return to go specifically to fund parks . <p> Even though park advocates support these changes , some fear that Congress will use any additional revenue to offset annual appropriations , defeating the purpose of raising funds . <p> " The government offset is a potential for disaster because private funding is soft money , and it can disappear in 24 hours , " says Bob Hansen , executive director of The Yosemite Fund , a nonprofit foundation that raises money for grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're very careful not to put any of our money into basic operations ... we do n't buy a squad car for a ranger , we 're not going to help repair the sewer system in Yosemite after the flood . . . the long and the short of it is the national parks are national . By description they belong to the American people , and we ought to be paying for them out of our taxes . " <p> And even if Congress approves all of the new funding ideas , these will not immediately make up for decades of shortfalls . Parks officials still will have to seek additional funds from private foundations , public-private partnerships , and corporations . None is a panacea ; each has its own pitfall . <p> " The risk obviously is of turning the Park Service into a tin-cup agency that is rattling its cup incessantly in front of any potential treasury it can find , " Simon says . " This is somewhat demeaning to the agency and its mission , which we view as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think there is a great risk in distracting the service from its core job . " <p> Besides distracting NPS from its mission , private funding could suggest to a donor that his or her gift carries greater control in park matters than it does . <p> " I turned down a proposal from prospective donors to leave $1 million in their will as long as they got a specific room at the Ahwahanee Hotel for the rest of their lives ... there ca n't be a quid pro quo , " Hansen says . <p> Some say it is more effective ( and appropriate ) for a professional fundraising organization such as the National Park Foundation ( NPF )  --  formed by Congress in 1967 to raise money for parks-to beat the bushes for money than for individual park officials to try to make deals with local groups and organizations . They cite the Park Service 's poor track record with concessions contracts . <p> Since 1990 , NPF has provided more than $15 million in grants to national parks through corporate backers including American Eagle , Canon U.S.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its detractors , the Park Service could not finance some of its projects without money from this quarter . <p> " The major pitfall is that in the rush to find a private partner , the Park Service staff will not be wise enough to do the kinds of due diligence on the partnership that 's required to get a good deal from a business sense , " Chandler says . " Parks people are not trained as business people . " <p> The Park Service is running into another issue in an effort to find profitable ways to use its buildings : access . For example , backpacking groups were furious with a plan at Glacier National Park in Montana to refurbish two historic backcountry chalets , says Phil Pearl , NPCA 's Pacific Northwest regional director . <p> Rooms were " a hundred-plus dollars a night . The Park Service should make at least one of them available to campers at a modest rate , " he says . <p> Park funding shortfalls will continue to provoke creative and controversial solutions . And it is going to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the Park Service sees the forest and the trees . <p> " You have to have an income stream , but the Park Service has to balance that , " says Woodford . " When does income become more important than the general mission ? " Creative Solutions <p> As FUNDING FOR national parks becomes ever tighter , Park Service officials must seek new and creative ways to use park resources . The result is a mixed bag of successes , questionable endeavors , and complicated issues of access , influence , and priorities . <p> One resounding success has been Fort Mason , part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco . Now in its 20th year , Fort Mason is managed by the Fort Mason Foundation , a nonprofit corporation set up to convert the military base to a cultural center It oversees 350,000 square feet of office space on 13 acres , with about 1.6 million visitors annually , says Marc Kasky , the foundation 's executive director Appoximately 550 groups use the facility , about 90 percent of them nonprofits . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and five museums and galleries . <p> " It 's a tremendous model of cooperation , " says Brian Huse , Pacific regional director for NPCA . " It has become so successful that the waiting list of nonprofits that want office space there is years long . " <p> The foundation has spent about $15 million to improve the once abandoned buildings . None of the money came from the Park Service budget or other federal sources . Self-supporting since its third year , the foundation every year returns money to capital projects , and its success continues to open financial doors . For example , Kasky says , the Park Service last year asked the foundation to create an exhibition hall in the Presidio , a former military base that is now part of Golden Gate . The foundation raised $1.2 million in six months . <p> Kasky attributes the success to several points : <p> Financial self-sufficiency . Though it does not own a single building or acre in Fort Mason , the foundation can raise money or obtain credit because it always sets goals it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just another rental facility where groups are sweating to pay the rent every month , " Kasky says . " Because we 're able to keep our rents low , groups are able to produce quality activities . " That attracts more people . <p> Trust . " The Park Service has allowed us to do what we 're good at . " Though the National Park Service oversees the foundation 's work it gives the foundation independence , and that attracts high-quality people , Kasky says . <p> Although trust and independence are important , Eileen Woodford , NPCA 's Northeast regional director , points out that the Park Service should have an established framework that includes criteria to ensure the agency receives the desired result . <p> Another success is the restoration of the Statue of Liberty . <p> " The Ellis Island Foundation has been our partner now for 13 years , and during that time they 've raised $440 million , " says Michael Adlerstein , the Park Service 's Northeast associate regional director " They have restored the Statue of Liberty , paid for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restored four of the 35 buildings on Ellis Island , all through their own fundraising . " <p> The foundation and the National Park Service work on agreements to identify a project , then develop fundraising and physical plans . The foundation works as the Park Service 's agent for planning , design , and construction . <p> Adlerstein feels that for public-private deals to work , the Park Service must take the lead . <p> " The ones that have not succeeded are the ones where the nonprofit has been ahead of us , " he says . " The Park Service has to be ahead of the train , identifying the need and doing the advance planning to establish how the need shall be satisfied . " Otherwise , he says , the private sector 's gung-ho energy grows muted by the slower pace at which the Park Service moves . <p> But public-private partnerships do have pitfalls . Sometimes , the private groups bite off more than they can chew , finding themselves unable to raise what they have pledged . Then the question is who picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group 's agenda supersedes the Park Service 's , and the question of influence and arm-twisting arises . And perhaps there is an even greater risk to the endless search for money . <p> " When you put a price on everything in the parks , you also are subtly eroding the atmosphere , " says Dave Simon , NPCA 's Southwest regional director " Things in parks are different from the rest of our consumer culture . They 're sanctuaries in many ways . . . they should be sanctuaries from the overwhelming dominance of consumerism and money .
