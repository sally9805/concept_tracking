##@x <p> Members of Congress call it , as they did its annual predecessors , a " crime bill . " In fact it 's a politics bill , meant to make Congress look tough on crime . This lumpy grab-bag of provisions , some for liberals and some for conservatives , constitutes a brutally bad bargain  --  unless the House and Senate can now remedy the recklessness as they reconcile their differences . <p> There are some welcome , constructive proposals in this legislation , notably one to establish a Police Corps that could help cities across the country . But the negative side of the scale plunges down under the weight of three drastic assaults on individual liberty . <p> Habeas corpus . The Senate thoughtlessly adopted a Bush Administration proposal that would virtually abolish Federal court review of state criminal convictions . The Senate bill would deny Federal courts the power to set aside erroneous constitutional rulings in state criminal cases as long as the issue had been " fully and fairly " heard in the state court . <p> To lawyers , " fully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more acceptable House provision would preserve Federal court power but streamline the process . <p> Exclusionary rule . Since 1914 , the Supreme Court has instructed Federal courts to throw out evidence obtained in violation of the Bill of Rights . At present , a search with a technically flawed warrant will be allowed if police acted in a " good faith " belief that they were proceeding lawfully . The Administration wants that exception broadened to searches conducted with no warrant at all . <p> In this instance , it was the Senate that wisely refused to go along . <p> Capital punishment . Both houses would extend the death penalty to dozens of Federal crimes . That 's a cynical exercise . Few murders come under Federal jurisdiction , and other crimes designated for death  --  treason , attempted assassination of the President and the like  --  are rare . Yet many Democrats went along with the pretense simply to protect against attacks from the right . <p> Now they may wish they had n't . Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York carried the bluster and bombast to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and a Federal death penalty for , all gun murders . That would be such a broad intrusion of the Federal nose into matters historically dealt with by states that it 's hard to see how anyone who regards himself as conservative could support it . <p> Yet the Senate approved the amendment with scant debate . And if that does n't seem cynical enough , it should be noted that Mr. D'Amato neglected to provide any new funds for Federal courts , now to be saddled with thousands of new cases . <p> The House rejected the D'Amato language but accepted a careless last-minute death penalty amendment of its own . It would allow capital punishment for any killing under Federal jurisdiction that results from reckless disregard for human life , not just those that are intentional . That standard would allow execution of a person who runs a red light and fatally injures a mailman . <p> Beyond these caprices , both houses rejected a proposal to protect against the infamous racial pattern of state executions . Murderers are executed with dismaying regularity when the victims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed a white murderer of a black victim . <p> On the positive side , the bill contains a clear breakthrough on gun control . The Senate passed a version of the Brady bill , creating a national waiting period before handgun purchases are permitted , and a ban on 14 assault weapons . Though the House cravenly rejected a ban on assault weapons , it has passed its own Brady bill . So a version of that worth while legislation could readily emerge from the conference committee that will reconcile the bills . <p> Both houses offered substantial money  --  about $1 billion in the House , nearly $2 billion in the Senate  --  for grants to overwhelmed , underfunded local criminal justice agencies . The money would finance programs like community policing , drug enforcement and drug treatment in prisons . <p> Both houses also approved creation of the Police Corps , involving scholarships for thousands of college students willing to work as police officers for four years after graduation . <p> Worthy as these measures are , however , they do n't justify the attacks on habeas corpus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death penalty . Only if the conference rejects those measures  --  an unlikely possibility  --  does this so-called crime bill merit further support . @@649976 Naples , Italy  --  1876 <p> What is the opposite of dTja vu ? <p> Louisa Clemens stopped in consternation barely a few paces into the parlor . The room felt peculiarly different , as if she had never set foot in it before . After working six years for the Winterbottoms , she knew every inch of their parlor  --  the blue carpet patterned with roses , the chintz-covered sofas , the ormolu clock on the mantel , and the glass case full of ferns in the corner of the bay window  --  yet she felt as if she had never been there before . <p> Plastering a fatade of normality over her sudden feeling of strangeness , something different caught Louisa 's eye , and she turned her head toward the side of the room where a man stood unabashedly staring at her . He was definitely not the sort of man she would expect to see in the Winterbottoms ' parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the sensation of foreignness overcoming her . <p> It was his eyes that she noticed first , piercing eyes transfixing her with a gaze that seemed to search out all her secrets and leave nothing hidden . They were dark gray , the color of cold English skies and frozen cobblestones , with only the barest hint of the deep , mysterious ink of midnight . <p> The rest of the company assembled in the room may just as well have been invisible for all the notice Louisa could spare them . Next to him , everyone else seemed utterly insignificant . He was a tempest , a hurricane , a force so powerful that it slammed against her chest until she could hardly draw a breath . Against a nature as strong as his , she would have no chance of resistance . <p> That was why the room had seemed so strange to her  --  because he was in it . His mere presence had transformed the Winterbottoms ' parlor into a room of mystery , a place Louisa no longer recognized . <p> She shivered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her shoulders , and turned her head away from danger , continuing toward the mother of the young children she chaperoned . Even though she could no longer see him , Louisa could feel the force of his gaze on her , stripping her bare . She knew that she had all of his attention . Everything about him was focused on her , and only on her . <p> " Ah , Miss Clemens , there you are . " Mrs. Winterbottom bustled cheerfully toward Louisa , her mahogany ringlets bouncing under her cap . " I was just telling our guests about my little cherubs and here you are with them both . You have impeccable timing . " <p> Though still shaken by the peculiar feeling that lingered in her spine and the directness of the stranger 's gaze , Louisa smiled perfunctorily at her employer . " Prudence , Hester , " she said gently to the two identical twin girls who trotted at her side , " make a curtsy for your mama . " <p> The girls did as they were bid , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the while sneaking wide-eyed peeks at the guests , and at the gray-eyed stranger in particular . <p> Louisa was not surprised at their curiosity . Even in this urbane and sophisticated household , where businessmen from many parts of the world visited Mr. Winterbottom , a guest like this was most unusual . <p> She sneaked a look at him herself out of the corner of her eye , not wishing to be caught by his gaze again , or to let him guess her interest . Everything about him was different . For a start , his skin was tanned to a deep brown , even far darker than the Italians among whom they lived . His high cheekbones lent his face a severe grace , and his hair fell in thick , black waves nearly to his shoulders instead of being neatly pomaded to sit flat against his head , the style preferred by most gentlemen . <p> His clothing was as unusual as his looks . Though his navy blue jacket was cut in the usual style , it was richly decorated with heavy gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the more usual black . He wore a round , red , high cap with a black tassel that made him appear even more exotic , while all the other men in the room were bareheaded , having removed their hats upon coming inside . He stood out among the crowd of Europeans as a wild hawk would stand out in a farmyard full of domesticated chickens . <p> The girls had dipped into a low curtsy . " Good girls , " Mrs. Winterbottom said approvingly as they straightened up again . " Now then , come and hug your mama . " <p> The pair obediently suffered a hug from their mother without undue wriggling . Inwardly , Louisa breathed a sigh of relief . Mrs. Winterbottom was a kindhearted woman and possessed the best of tempers , but the one thing she hated above all else was having her fine silk dress ruffled  --  particularly when she was in the company of handsome guests , as she was this evening . <p> There was no denying that the man who had caught Louisa 's attention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive than the pallid young Englishman with ginger sideburns paying court to one of Mrs. Winterbottom 's friends , and even more good-looking than the dark-haired and debonair Italian count flirting outrageously with the elderly  --  and terribly wealthy  --  dowager in the corner . <p> Louisa glanced over at Mr. Winterbottom as he poured sherry at the sideboard . Next to the visitor , even Mr. Winterbottom looked pale and uninteresting . She noticed for the first time that his hairline was starting to recede and that , despite his firmly buttoned waistcoat , good living had given him a slight paunch . In contrast , the stranger looked to be all hard muscle with barely an ounce of fat on him , strong and untamed , and quite out of place in this quiet , gentile setting . <p> Seeming quite unperturbed by the dangerous allure that hung about the stranger like a miasma , Mrs. Winterbottom guided her daughters toward him .
