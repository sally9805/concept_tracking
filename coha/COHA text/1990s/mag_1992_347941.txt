BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO  --  ESPECIALLY FOR A prince and princess . This schism even warranted a statement from the floor of the House of Commons by the Prime Minister , who formally set some of the terms for what is , practically , the end of the 11-year marriage of Charles and Diana , the Prince and Princess of Wales . Reading from a Buckingham Palace statement to a hushed chamber , John Major explained that the couple would not divorce but would lead separate lives , carrying out their royal duties on independent schedules and getting together only for the most important public occasions . They will share in the upbringing of their children , Princes William , 10 , and Henry , 8 . <P> The separation is not expected to alter the constitutional status of the royal couple : Charles remains next in line for the throne . Diana can still expect to become Queen , said Major , drawing murmurs of confusion from the House . Perhaps the coronation could be shown on split screen .
