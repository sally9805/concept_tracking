<p> ' AMERICA <p> FIRST ' <p> Editor  --  Much has been said and written about Pat Buchanan 's entry into the 1992 presidential sweepstakes . Too much has been said about his being an " America Firster . " I pose a question : " What is wrong with being an America Firster ? " <p> Equating the pre-World War II era , when we were ostensibly America First in our thinking , with our being vulnerable is ridiculous . Without a standing Army , Navy or Air Force , and with no huge military manufacturing complex ( as we have today )  --  we rose to complete victory , humiliating the two most heinous military powers of the time . We had credibility and the will to win . It worked . <p> Today , with all our might and military industrial plant , we stand as the quasi-victor in a gulf war which left the perpetrator as strong and as dangerous as he was at the outset of the war . Were we to be confronted with a danger , our credibility and politics would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have never been more ready to become an America First nation than we are today . It is time . We have gained very little from feeding and protecting a world which has thanked us with unfair competition in the market place and open defiance in world forums such as the U.N . <p> It is time for us to think about and care for Americans in America . If that means we must be America Firsters , then I am today an America Firster . <p> If Russia and her people need help , let us give it in return for a chattel on her gold and oil reserves  --  of which she has tremendous amounts  --  and a complete dismantling of her military might . <p> We must have a quid pro quo henceforth . We 've got to stop being the patsy for the world . If that is America First , so be it . <p> WILLIAM HELLER <p> Half Moon Bay <p> ' DOWNSIZING ' <p> Editor  --  As an unemployed professional who has been twice victimized by the restructuring frenzy that is leaving so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do more than just find another slot in the corporate world . <p> I now realize that I must make significant lifestyle changes in order to conform to the realities of the ' 90s . Thus , my life is being rebuilt around the following steps . <p> 1 . Acknowledge that the partnership between management and professional employees is dead . No loyalty should be given to or expected from any business entity beyond that for which one is fully compensated . <p> 2 . Absolutely refuse to use consumer credit of any kind except for the purchase of a home . Never refinance a home loan . <p> 3 . Without exception , save at least 15 percent of the family income each month . <p> 4 . Avoid all frivolous and non-essential spending . <p> 5 . Replace workaholism and materialism with meaningful and supportive relationships with family members and friends . <p> In an era when corporations do not seem to give a damn about disrupting tens of thousands of lives with layoffs , I am convinced that my personal " downsizing " is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> JOHN QUINTAL <p> San Jose <p> BAD TIMES , BUT . . . <p> Editor  --  An increasing number of your correspondents ( and columnists ) insist on calling the current recession a " depression . " It is not . <p> During the Great Depression of the 1930s , the measured unemployment rate peaked at 25 percent of the labor force . Allowing for the much-ballyhooed discouraged worker effect , the best estimate of the actual unemployment rate is in the neighborhood of 33 percent . By contrast , today 's 6.8 percent unemployment rate is puny . <p> Look at it this way . In 1933 , one out of every three people was unemployed and probably had been for a year or two . Today , it 's about one in 14 . Sorry , folks , back to your rhetoric classes . While things may seem bad today , it is n't a depression . <p> TONY LIMA , economics professor <p> Cal State Hayward <p> WILSON IS N'T SCROOGE <p> Editor  --  Your Friday paper ( Chronicle , December 13 ) reports welfare advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest proposal . What a ridiculous comparison . Scrooge , the fictional character , had lots of money that he never gave away . Wilson and California , real life this time , have been giving away money that is n't even there for some time now . <p> I did not vote Pete Wilson for Santa Claus . I voted for governor of California . Governor Wilson is trying to do what is best for all of California , including the taxpayers . Christmas has been over for many people in the state who have lost jobs due to the eroding economy . It 's time for everyone to take their fair share of pay cuts . <p> I support Governor Wilson in his efforts to get California back on track . <p> NANCY RIFKIND <p> Modesto <p> OFFER TO THE GOVERNOR <p> Editor  --  I see that our governor is proposing to reduce the state deficit , a laudable goal , by reducing the allowance to the indigent and those on what is broadly called welfare . <p> It is easy to plunder the weak and those without political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How about extending this involuntary contribution to the financial health of the state with a voluntary pay cut of 10 percent for all state employees , including the governor , and a similar increase in the taxes of all of us so fortunate as to be gainfully employed ? <p> Should our governor initiate a pay cut for those who are employed by the state , I will support a tax increase on myself ; both moves directed to the goal of deficit reduction . Sadly , that is an easy offer to make , since the likelihood of action by the governor is not large . <p> EDWARD M. LEWIS <p> San Rafael <p> POINTING THE FINGER <p> Editor  --  Governor Wilson and others who point to the poor as the reason for the country 's tax and spending problems are pointing in the wrong direction . <p> Nationwide , since 1973 , the average payment to recipients of " welfare " ( Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) has , in real buying power , dropped by almost 20 percent . During the same time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real buying power , increased by about 50 percent . Similarly , per-person Medicare costs for the elderly have increased , in real dollars , about 200 percent . Correspondingly , Social Security payroll taxes have increased the fastest . <p> It 's not poor kids with dark skins who are straining the taxpayer ; it 's moderately well-off retirees with light skins . <p> CLAUDE S. FISCHER , professor <p> UC Berkeley <p> RAPE MYOPIA <p> Editor  --  Women want sexual harassment to be determined not by what a reasonable man considers it to be , but what each woman thinks . <p> Yet women are equally myopic on the subject of rape . They refuse to believe that their behavior could ever possibly contribute to rape . They maintain that no dress or behavior , no matter how egregious , could possibly provoke a rapist . But provocation is a factor in many non-sexual assaults , why is it surprising that it is a factor in rape ? <p> In her book , " Against Our Will , " Susan Brownmiller asks why men rape . Most men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alcohol , and opportunity are definitely factors , particularly in " date rape . " Women are deluding themselves , at their peril , by ignoring their responsibility , i.e .. to imagine what effect their behavior has on men . <p> ROBERT D. BAKER <p> San Mateo <p> HIS WORD VS . HER WORD <p> Editor  --  I 'm disappointed that so many spokespeople for women 's groups have the attitude that women will not report rape or harassment because of the outcomes in the William Kennedy Smith verdict and Judge Thomas ' hearing . <p> Thomas and his supporters clearly and cleverly made the issue a racial one , which clouded the real issue . <p> As for Smith , his version of events fit the existing facts and the accuser 's version did not . It seems that the significance of Smith 's guilt or innocence is being overlooked by many women . Putting aside his money and the legal expertise , it came down to his word against hers to a jury seeking to find the truth . <p> Ms. KIT MILLER <p> Danville <p> POLITICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 10th . The Agnos political autopsy has been ordered , and the results will arrive in due time . <p> The pathology findings will be interesting . Swelling homelessness , a bad diet of egomania , too little grass-roots , poor street hygiene , ignoring of quarantine postings  --  " Businesses Moving "  --  and reliance on radical quacks and placebos over trusted medicine . A chain-smoking mentality and a mean-spirited reliance on voodoo economics did n't help either . <p> The man just never understood healthy people exercise their vote . <p> J. DAVIS MANNINO <p> San Francisco <p> ' HATE CAMPAIGN ' <p> Editor  --  Congratulations , Louisiana , for defeating David Duke 's racist campaign by a landslide . <p> Shame on you , San Francisco , for allowing Art Agnos ' campaign of racial hate to come much closer to winning .
