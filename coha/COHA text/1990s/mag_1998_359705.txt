Joni Mitchell keeps her own time . Twenty-nine years after Woodstock , 29 years after she turned back en route to playing the original , generation-defining concert because she had heard about the mud , heard about the traffic , heard that it was all a disaster anyway , 29 years later , she is at " A Day at the Garden , " a memorial concert held in August at the site of the original festival in Bethel , N.Y . " Took 30 years to get here , " she cracks as she takes the stage . The crowd at that first Woodstock was half a million strong ; at this sequel it 's about 20,000 weak . <P> No matter . Mitchell is in a good mood and in good voice , and she delivers a jazzy , ebullient set , floating through a few songs from her latest CD , Taming the Tiger . Then , alone with her guitar , she offers up a spare , resonant reading of her gently anthemic song Woodstock . " We are stardust ... And we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sings . The lyrics seem to belong to another age , an era of idealism and Abbie Hoffman and moon landings and electric Kool-Aid acid tests and B-52s bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trail . But even as she sings , Mitchell is planted in the present . There 's a rootedness about her ; she 's too grounded to be carried off by gusts of nostalgia . She keeps her own time . <P> With protest songs such as Big Yellow Taxi and classic folk-pop albums like Blue , the Canadian-born Mitchell established herself as one of the most important singer-songwriters in rock . But she does n't consider herself a folkie ; she sees herself somewhere between Miles Davis and Bob Dylan  --  unclassifiable . She has bebopped with Charles Mingus and explored African rhythms with the warrior drums of Burundi . A record store of younger artists  --  Seal , Sarah McLachlan , even Janet Jackson  --  has acknowledged her influence . Virtually every act on the first Lilith Fair owed her a debt , if not royalties . But because she 's been so groundbreaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical and commercial rewards she so richly deserves . <P> " The industry dropped me for 20 years , " says Mitchell , now 55 . " They would n't let me in . No matter what I did , they would n't let me on the radio or on MTV . " She says most of what she hears on the radio is " crap . " " It 's all about Wall Street now . And the record is just a poker chip . And these , you know , artists are going willingly into the slaughter . " There are , however , a few things she likes . " Most of my favorite artists are black , " says Mitchell , who admires James Brown , Etta James and Duke Ellington . " All modern music is black . " She also has nothing but praise for Janet Jackson 's song Got ' Til It 's Gone , an R.-and-B. reworking of Mitchell 's Big Yellow Taxi . But she has mostly contempt for alternative rock . " Everybody says Kurt Cobain was a great writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is he a hero ? Whining and killing yourself  --  I fail to see the heroism in that . "
