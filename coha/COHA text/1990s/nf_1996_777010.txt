The Dilbert Principle // I use a lot of " bad boss " themes in my syndicated cartoon strip " Dilbert . " I 'll never run out of material . I get at least two hundred e-mail messages a day , mostly from people who are complaining about their own clueless managers . Here are some of my favorite stories , all allegedly true : // A vice president insists that the company 's new battery-powered product be equipped with a light that comes on to tell you when the power is off . An employee suggests setting priorities so the company will know how to apply its limited resources . The manager 's response : " Why ca n't we concentrate our resources across the board ? " A manager wants to find and fix software bugs more quickly . He offers an incentive plan : $20 for each bug the Quality Assurance people find and $20 for each bug the programmers fix . ( These are the same programmers who create the bugs . ) Result : An underground economy in " bugs " springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets $1,700 the first week . // Stories like these prompted me to do the first annual Dilbert Survey to find out what management practices were most annoying to employees . The choices included the usual suspects : Quality , Empowerment , Reengineering , and the like . But the number-one vote-getter in this highly unscientific survey was " Idiots Promoted to Management . " // This seemed like a subtle change from the old concept by which capable workers were promoted until they reached their level of incompetence-best described as the " Peter Principle . " Now , apparently , the incompetent workers are promoted directly to management without ever passing through the temporary competence stage . // When I entered the workforce in 1979 , the Peter Principle described management pretty well . Now I think we 'd all like to return to those Golden Years when you had a boss who was once good at something . // I get all nostalgic when I think about it . Back then , we all had hopes of being promoted beyond our levels of competence . Every worker had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pits while reaping large bonuses and stock options . It was a time when inflation meant everybody got an annual raise ; a time when we freely admitted that the customers did n't matter . It was a time of joy . // We did n't appreciate it then , but the much underrated Peter Principle always provided us with a boss who understood what we did for a living . Granted , he made consistently bad decisions-after all , he had no management skills . But at least they were the informed decisions of a seasoned veteran from the trenches. // Example // Boss : " When I had your job I could drive a three-inch rod through a metal casing with one motion . If you 're late again I 'll do the same thing to your head . " // Nitpickers found lots of problems with the Peter Principle , but on the whole it worked . Lately , however , the Peter Principle has given way to the " Dilbert Principle . " The basic concept of the Dilbert Principle is that the most ineffective workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least damage : management . // This has not proved to be the winning strategy that you might think . // Maybe we should learn something from nature . In the wild , the weakest moose is hunted down and killed by dingo dogs , thus ensuring survival of the fittest . This is a harsh system-especially for the dingo dogs who have to fly all the way from Australia . But nature 's process is a good one ; everybody agrees , except perhaps for the dingo dogs and the moose in question . . . and the flight attendants . But the point is that we 'd all be better off if the least competent managers were being eaten by dingo dogs instead of writing Mission Statements . // It seems as if we 've turned nature 's rules upside down . We systematically identify and promote the people who have the least skills . The usual business rationalization for promoting idiots ( the Dilbert Principle in a nutshell ) is something along the lines of " Well , he ca n't write code , he ca n't design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . But he has very good hair . . . " // If nature started organizing itself like a modern business , you 'd see , for example , a band of mountain gorillas led by an " alpha " squirrel . And it would n't be the most skilled squirrel ; it would be the squirrel nobody wanted to hang around with . // I can see the other squirrels gathered around an old stump saying stuff like " If I hear him say , ' I like nuts ' one more time , I 'm going to kill him . " The gorillas , overhearing this conversation , lumber down from the mist and promote the unpopular squirrel . The remaining squirrels are assigned to Quality Teams as punishment . // You may be wondering if you fit the description of a Dilbert Principle manager . Here 's a little test : // 1 . Do you believe that anything you do n't understand must be easy to do ? // 2 . Do you feel the need to explain in great detail why " profit " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think employees should schedule funerals only during holidays ? // 4 . Are the following words a form of communication or gibberish : // The Business Services Leadership Team will enhance the organization in order to continue on the journey toward a Market Facing Organization ( MFO ) model . To that end , we are consolidating the Object Management for Business Services into a cross strata team . // 5 . When people stare at you in disbelief do you repeat what you just said , only louder and more slowly ? // Now give yourself one point for each question you answered with the letter " B. " If your score is greater than zero , congratulations-there are stock options in your future . // ( The language in question four is from an actual company memo. ) // The Dilbert Principle Illustrated // Humiliation // Employee morale is a risky thing . Happy employees will work harder without asking for extra pay . But if they get too happy , endorphins kick in , egos expand , and everybody starts whining about the fact that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumpster after retirement . // The best balance of morale for employee productivity can be described this way : happy , but with low self-esteem . // You can test your own level of employee happiness with this test . If you laugh out loud at any of the " office witticisms " shown here , then you are happy in exactly the right amount to be productive : // Happiness Productivity Test // Below are several witticisms encountered in your office every day . How many do you find irresistibly funny ? // 1 . " Are you working hard or hardly working ? " // 2 . " Are you holding up the wall ? " // 3 . " You look different today ! " ( said to someone at a borrowed desk ) // 4 . " It 's not my day to watch Bob . " // 5 . " Not bad for a Wednesday ! " // If you laughed at any of the five witticisms , you have the proper **27;231;TOOLONG kind of happy that spells productivity . But if during this test you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to bludgeon with a speakerphone , then you might have too much self-esteem to be productive . // The Solution : Humiliation // Over the years , businesses have developed a broad range of techniques that bring employees ' self-esteem back into the " productive zone " without sacrificing happiness . This chapter discusses the most important humiliation techniques . // Cubicles Hoteling Furniture Dress clothes Employee Recognition Programs Undervaluing employee contributions Making them wait // Cubicles // Cubicles-sometimes called " work spaces " or " pods " - serve as a constant reminder of the employee 's marginal value to the company . I 've never seen a brochure from a cubicle manufacturer , but I think it would look something like this : // The Cubicle 6000(TM) Series // Think of The Cubicle 6000(TM) as a lifestyle , not just a big box to keep your crap in one place ! ! // We used nature as our guide when we designed The Cubicle 6000(TM) . Every unit has the unmistakable motivational feel of the four most inspiring locations on earth : // Veal-Fattening Pen : // Imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their individual living units , without a care in the world . The reaffirming message is " Live for today ! " // Cardboard Box : // It 's the same architecture that has transported the possessions of successful people for hundreds of years ! // Baby 's Playpen : // A reminder of the exuberance of youth and the thrill of being held captive by strange people who speak gibberish and punish you for reasons you do n't understand ! // Prison Cell : //
