It is not every day that a man gets to jettison the ethical and aesthetic standards of a lifetime . Until now , the guiding principle of my journalistic career has been so rock-bottom firm , so bristling with integrity , that it could be etched on my tombstone : HE NEVER WROTE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP . <P> Like most moral strictures that are actually obeyed ( the classic example : Do not worship a golden calf ) , this one never impinged on my life-style . It 's not as if I toil for a New York City tabloid and have to beg some hard-boiled city editor , " Please , I 'll do anything  --  Madonna , Heidi Fleiss , even Shannen Doherty . Anything but the Trump beat . " <P> But my high-minded aversion to shameless self-promoters vanished with the recent birth of that 7-lb. 7-oz. love child , Tiffany Ariana Trump . Make no mistake , this is not the beginning of a screed on Family Values left over from last year 's Republican National Convention . The way I see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private matter best left to their attorneys , their accountants and their spokesmen . Instead , what fascinated me was their decision to name this blue-eyed baby girl Tiffany . <P> Even as the lawyers fretted over the child 's heir rights , the tabloid tom- toms spread the word that the infant 's moniker was a belated art-of-the- deal tribute to real estate air rights . The eponymous Trump Tower was built in 1983 with the help of that patch of Manhattan sky owned by Tiffany &; Co . How much more tasteful had the parents simply explained that Tiffany rhymes with epiphany . <P> The advertising world is in a swivet because familiar mass-market brand names such as Pampers and Marlboro are suddenly reeling from low-priced generic competitors . Tiny Tiffany Trump , in contrast , symbolizes the enduring cachet of a certain type of luxurious commercial pedigree . What could be more emblematic of this shopping-obsessed century than a fin-de-siecle vogue for naming children after favored stores ? After all , the latest list of the most popular names for girls already veers toward the comically pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane and simple Susan . <P> Picture a kindergarten of the future as the teacher calls the alphabetical roll : " Armani , Burberry , Cartier , Fendi , Gucci , Hermes . . . " all the way down to " . . . Valentino , Vuitton and Zabar . " Instead of superhero lunch boxes , these kids will tote personalized shopping bags . And what about children cursed with parents whose taste in store names is simply too plebeian ? On Geraldo , talk-show shrinks will discuss the trauma of low-rent names like Kmart Smith and Shoe-Town Jones . <P> Tiffany  --  as I 'm sure countless parents will argue  --  is different . It sounds so mellifluous , so venerable , so upper-crust American . In the early 1960s , a pretty junior high classmate of mine served as a harbinger of the future by answering to Tiffany . Her we-should-have-seen-i t-coming destiny : a brief career as a braless starlet on a now forgotten TV sitcom . <P> To think that it all began with Charles Lewis Tiffany , who became famous in the 1850s by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertising slogan : " Her head went to the guillotine , but her diamonds are forever .
