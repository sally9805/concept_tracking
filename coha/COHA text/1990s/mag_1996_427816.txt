THE FIRST BUNKER in Williamsburg , Virginia , presumably was built in the late 1700s . It no doubt was a rather crude structure , as its designer did n't consult a Robert Trent Jones or a Pete Dye . But it-and many others-surely proved useful in protecting Revolutionary War soldiers from British attacks . Today bunkers are making a comeback in Williamsburg , albeit as more sporting versions . This famous colonial city ( capital of the Virginia colony from 1699-1780 ) has nearly doubled its number of quality golf courses in the past two years alone , this the result of simple supply and demand : Williamsburg already has the draw , with its historical sights , and the game 's surge in popularity has every smart tourist area re-evaluating its current golf product . Even history buffs ca n't live on guided tours alone . Prior to the 1920s , Williamsburg had become a broken-down city , the role it had played in our country 's emergence virtually forgotten . That 's when philanthropist and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller Jr . started rebuilding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage . They did-and still do . Colonial Williamsburg now is a living museum , its mile-long block of 18th-century taverns and trade shops-replete with costumed keepers-attracting more than a million tourists each year . Golf , too , has long been a part of Williamsburg , with the Golden Horseshoe and Kingsmill Resorts , and more recently Ford 's Colony . But now more than ever golf is riding the coattails of Rockefeller 's gamble . Three new courses opened in the city last year , and the Legends Group , of Myrtle Beach fame , is unveiling two more nearby this summer . In addition , arranging to play just got a lot easier . The Williamsburg Area Golf Association was established earlier this year to forge relationships between local courses , resorts , and hotels . So history will remain the main event in Williamsburg , but golf now is one heck of a side show . Honored by this magazine as a to new layout last year , The Colonial Golf Course is itself a breakthrough , as it is Williamsburg 's first daily-fee facility . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing terrain , which already had plenty of personality . " Build me the best course this land can yield , " developer Francis Fenderson told architect Lester George and design consultant Robert Wrenn , a PGA Tour veteran . So George and Wrenn went to work , armed mainly with their imaginations , trying to uncover rather than manufacture holes . Photograph The par-five 13th hole on Kingsmill 's Woods Course sweeps down on the approach to a green carved out of a river bank // Their efforts produced a gently flowing course that weaves through tall white oaks and patches of holly trees and flowering mountain laurels . Several wetland branches from adjacent Mill Creek were also incorporated , most dramatically at the sixth hole , a medium-length par three that calls for a daring carry over marsh to an elevated green . Heroic shots are not the norm at The Colonial , however , as most of the holes offer ample fairways and run-up greens . The layout adjoins a threehole practice course and a state-ofthe-art instructional center . Green fees run from $45-$65 , including cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another newcomer last year was Williamsburg National Golf Club , whose golf course is a creation of Jim Lipe Jr. , one of Jack Nicklaus 's main design associates ( Jack was not involved here , though ) . Like The Colonial , this course roams through dense woodlands , which creates a distinct feeling of isolation on several of the holes . The 11th plays 420 yards , over a wide gully on the drive and to a green perched in front of a sunken forest . Pure nature and a very good golf hole , too . Also of particular interest here are the greenside bunkers , which feed into the greens with steep , grassed banks . However , no fewer than six holes are without a bunker , a nice example of leaving well enough alone on a site that has plenty of natural undulation to test greenside dexterity . Williamsburg National is a public facility with green fees ranging from $46-$76 , including cart . Call ( 800 ) 826-5732 . The third new course to come on line last year was the Woods Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf ( including Bray Links , a par-three course along the James River ) . Designed by Tom Clark and two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange , Kingsmill 's touring pro , the Woods is tucked in the northeastern corner of the property , a three-mile ride from the hubbub of resort central . Running along deep , wooded ravines , the Woods is all about shot placement , measuring an amicable 6,393 yards from the middle tees ( 6,784 yards from the tips ) . A few holes can really get your nerves up , though , like the par-five fifth , where the last 80 yards hang over a 60foot-deep ravine . Long hitters can have a go at it in two , but anything short is history . It 's a classic riskreward par five . Photograph The sixth at The Colonial calls for a gutty carry over a tidal marsh . // The 493-yard , par-five 13 th hole is a real charmer . Skirting a steep falloff on the right , the hole slides down to a diagonal green carved out of an embankment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand at the crest of the fairway and pan across the water to the timberland on the opposite shore , you almost forget how tough a play you have-almost . The Woods has many dramatic moments-not the least of which is a Space Mountainesque cart ride through a gorge-but the highhandicapper can find solace in bailout areas when the going gets tough . Kingsmill 's biggest attraction still is the River Course , a ripping test that annually hosts the PGA Tour 's Michelob ( formerly the AnheuserBusch ) Classic . The River was laid out by Pete Dye in 1975 and is considered one of his friendlier designs , although he did toss in a few pot bunkers for good measure , most notably one encased in railroad ties fronting the llth green . In general , the greens are small and wildly sloped ; in fact , many are mere plateaus punched into the fronts of steep banks ( errant approaches can bound into some hideous spots ) . There is no shortage of drama off the tee either , as several holes ask for a healthy poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save some strength-and some film-for the River 's home stretch . The 427-yard 16th is cut in half by a track of railroad ties , where it drops to a lower level and a sidehill green in front of the James River . The parthree 17th plays from a tall bluff overhanging the water to a thin , hilltop green . When the wind whips off the river , these holes are bears . If you 're a Tour junkie , you 'll enjoy coming in on the River Course , as you pass a beer-sponsored leader board on every other hole . You can almost hear the galleries . The Plantation Course at Kingsmill , an Arnold Palmer-Ed Seay collaboration , is not as demanding as its sister courses , but it is the resort 's toughest putting test . Virtually all of the greens feature two or more levels , with lots of bumps and ridges , and most are heavily bunkered . At just 6,605 yards from the back tees , what the course lacks in length it makes up for at the greens .

A short gallop from the restored historic exhibits of Colonial Williamsburg is the granddaddy of Williamsburg golf : The Golden Horseshoe , or " The Shoe , " as locals say . Designed by the legendary Robert Trent Jones , the Golden Horseshoe Gold Course opened as Williamsburg 's first regulation 18-holer in 1963 . Built on a rolling tract of land zigzagged by sharp ravines , the Gold Course is naturally endowed with the kind of contour and definition that modern designers achieve with bulldozers . A piece of advice : Take a good look back from the greens , the views through these winding hole corridors are sublime . The Gold is most memorable for its par threes , which , as a group , just may be the finest on any course , anywhere . Each plays from a hilltop tee over water-the 16th green is an island , in fact-with broad views of the rambling Virginia countryside . To play all four of these stunners in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . In 1991 , Colonial Williamsburg hired Rees Jones to design a course to complement his dad 's . The resulting Green Course was laid over similar hills and vales , but while the Gold plays through ravines , the Green Course runs alongside of them . In fact , the fairways on the Green are flanked by " saving " mounds , which effectively broaden the landing areas and help contain errant shots . Take the par-five 18th , whose banked borders redirect all sorts of wayward drives , and the same goes for its amphitheater green . Without lacking punch from the back tees ( at 7,120 yards ) , the Green Course provides a scenic outing that rivals the Gold , on a much more manageable golf course . Green fees at The Golden Horseshoe , including cart , run from $68$125 ( $50-$95 for guests at Colonial Williamsburg hotels ) , and $20$40 for the Spotswood Executive Course , another Trent Jones creation .

Following graceful elevation changes , many of the holes sweep down from raised tees and climb again to the greens . The bunkers throughout the course are notable for their flashed-up faces and jagged banks , like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle . Feature holes include the 402-yard fourth on the White nine , which starts out over a lake that ducks left and reappears to almost engulf the green . A trio of amoeba-shaped bunkers protect the shallow putting surface , which is connected to the fairway by a skinny neck of land at the right front . The surrounding water view is inspiring indeed . Green fees at Ford 's Colony range from $45-$95 , including cart . Call ( 804 ) 258-4130 . But if inspiration is what you 're after , look no further . The Legends Group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more beauties just outside Williamsburg , both designed by Mike Strantz , a Tom Fazio protege . Those who have played any of the Legends courses will expect something special in Williamsburg . They will not be disappointed . Sprawling over 250 acres , Royal New Kent in Providence Forge ( 25 miles from Colonial Williamsburg ) is a big , broad-shouldered links design , the owners ' tribute to the venerable Royal County Down in Northern Ireland , one of the world 's most scenic and distinct courses . To capture the Irish charm , the course plans to graze a small flock of sheep-$100 a head from the University of Virginia-in the hills . Another quaint scene-setter : A kilted bagpiper will usher in the sunset each evening . But Royal New Kent will impress best with its golf . The holes play from runway-sized tees to fairways wedged between massive , fescuecovered mounds , some standing 5075 feet tall . Many of the greens are set on top of these hills , with fronting " pit " bunkers waiting to gobble up the weak approach . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size , you will encounter false fronts , huge swells , and multiple putting levels . In short , Royal New Kent is a rigorous test of golf , with no let-up . The par-three 12th hole demonstrates the mix of awe and challenge found throughout . A hulking oneshotter that plays downhill to a crescent-shaped green surrounded by near-vertical mounds , it takes the term " amphitheater green " to a new level . Given a deep hole locationthe green is 86 yards long-the hole can play to a monstrous 270 yards from the " Invicta " tee ( that 's Latin for " unconquerable " ) . With a temporary USGA Slope Rating of 141 from the middle tees , Royal New Kent ranks tougher than any championship tee in Virginia . The current Slope from the Invicta tees-so tough they have their own scorecard-is a staggering 147 . You 'll need documented proof of a handicap of three or less to venture back there . But with five sets of tees , everyone can find their comfort zone . Royal New Kent will open to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new public-access venue , in Toano ( 10 miles from Colonial Williamsburg ) is no less dramatic . A strapping . mountain course , Stonehouse makes full use of its severe , heavily treed terrain , to say the least . No fewer than six tees ask for ravine carries and two of the greens , the first and 14th , actually sit at the bottom of ravines , some 60 or 70 feet below the fairway . Bunkers dug out of these steep ravine sides are so upright they were constructed with a synthetic lining that prevents washout during rains . The par-three 17th is particularly memorable . It 's the shortest hole on the course , at just 172 yards from the back tee , but an 80-foot-deep gorge separates the tee from the green , which is wrapped around the peak of a mountain , its banks plunging down into the wilderness . It 's a striking mix of raw nature and golf . Have a few extra bullets on hand for this one . At press time , Stonehouse was set to open on May 15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . But with wide fairways , huge greens , and multiple sets of tees on each hole , they should prove playable for anyone .
