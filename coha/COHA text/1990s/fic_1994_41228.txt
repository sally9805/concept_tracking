Early light was filling the sky behind the Pasadena Hills when Matthew Klinger arrived in the valley of the Rose Bowl . The asphalt parking lots surrounding the huge stadium were still empty , and the last of the sellers ' trucks and vans were passing through an entrance gate in the chainlink fence that enclosed the Sunday flea market , which was being set up in the shadow of the amphitheater . Inside the fence , hundreds of vehicles had already been positioned to form tenement rows and narrow passageways , leaving just enough room for the sellers to erect tables upon which to display their wares and awnings to shield themselves from the sun 's glare that , together with a horde of pedestrian buyers , would soon invade the market . Klinger parked his car in one of the empty lots , near an improbable sapling that had been planted in the tarmac ; then he climbed out and started up a sidewalk towards the entrance gate . He was wearing an old wool cardigan to ward off the spring morning chill , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was filled with expectation . <p> During the week , Klinger was a conservator of paintings at a small but reputable museum in one of the satellite cities that float in the vast metropolitan archipelago of Los Angeles . There , surrounded by solvents , swabs , spatulas , brushes , paints , putties , and other accouterments of his craft , he spent his days exploring the microcosmic terrain of canvases , mapping tiny cracks and cleavages , studying the tracery of brush marks , analyzing the composition of pigment , removing accretions of grime , dissolving old varnish , mending tears , patching holes , and inpainting scratches . Twenty years of such exacting and meticulous labor had made him indispensable to a series of ambitious directors for whom the museum was merely a stepping stone . It had also given him the discerning eye of a cognoscente , which a meager salary and the financial burden of a mother in a nursing home prevented him from exercising except in the performance of his custodial duties . <p> One morning , Klinger happened to read in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years that they had inherited a Van Gogh print from an aunt who traveled in France , only to discover that its corrugated surface had been scraped from the palette of the master himself . Shortly thereafter , he learned that a Homer watercolor he was re-matting had spent the first half of the century in an attic trunk in Saratoga . That same week , a colleague called to ask if he had heard about the Thomas Moran that had turned up in a yard sale in Fresno . Klinger hung up the telephone and prepared to resume cleaning <p> painting by Donna Schuster  --  the portrait of a summer-frocked woman , who , standing in a sunlit rose arbor with her head tilted in dreamy contemplation , seemed to Klinger ( a lifelong bachelor ) to embody the essence of femininity  --  when it occurred to him that there must be works of similar luminosity languishing in cellars , sheds , and attics across the land . The idea changed his life , for , like the infrared light that exposes the hidden flaws of a forgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his work table and took a deep breath as satisfaction with the enhancement wrought by his ministrations upon the flesh tones of the woman in the rose arbor gave way to a craving for possession . <p> Klinger 's weekends were soon transformed . On Saturday mornings , he made the rounds of garage sales ; on Saturday afternoons , following visits to the nursing home , he prowled through antique shops ; and on Sundays , he haunted the flea markets , where the sheer numbers of dealers , the volume of their wares , and the randomness with which they were displayed not only afforded the best chance of happening upon a masterwork , but had already led to a series of small triumphs that hung on the walls of his flat . A landscape by Fries from the Sports Arena in San Diego ; a mission scene by Merriam from the stadium at Long Beach ; an Enneking that had made its way from Boston to Santa Barbara to the County Fairgrounds in Ventura  --  such modest acquisitions reinforced his dream by serving to remind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... <p> In this frame of mind , Klinger arrived at a ticket booth beneath the looming facade of the Rose Bowl , where he paid ten dollars for entering early , and pushed through a turnstile . <p> No aboriginal scout ever stalked his quarry or scoured the underbrush by a trailside as assiduously as did Klinger on the prowl through the forest of the flea market . Like scanning radar , his eyes traversed tables laden with glass , crystal , china , porcelain , pottery , clocks , kitchenware , mirrors , dolls , knives , guns , and costume jewelry . His gaze swept across rugs weighted with furniture , lamps , victrolas , trumpets , duck decoys , fishing gear , early radios , old books , antique tools , and vintage toys . His field of vision encompassed racks draped with linens , quilts , and period clothes , and boxes filled with prints , magazines , and photo albums . He saw everything and nothing , because he instantly disregarded anything that was not connected with the object of his search . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped , it was to look at an acid-burned watercolor that had been propped against a table leg ; if he veered off his path , it was to peer into the back of a truck to see if there might be a canvas that had not been unpacked . <p> So intent was Klinger upon the hunt that he took little notice of his fellow foragers , who included antique dealers after hand-carved furniture ; jewelers searching for Spratling silver ; connoisseurs of fine glass and porcelain ; fishermen on the lookout for vintage reels ; and youthful collectors of beer mugs and baseball cards . His ears were finely tuned , however , to the negotiations being conducted all around him by buyers and sellers bent on beating each other to a bargain . <p> " Much you asking ? " <p> " Got to have two hundred . " <p> " Two hundred ! " <p> " Guaranteed museum piece . " <p> " What 's your best price ? " <p> " Make me an offer . " <p> " Say to one-sixty ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , Klinger picked up an unframed landscape  --  a desert-and-mountain scene that was leaning against the sliding door of a van  --  and held it to catch the sunlight that was beginning to come over the surrounding hills . <p> " Listed painter , " said the voice of a man , who was sitting in the front of the vehicle , observing Klinger through a side-view mirror . <p> Klinger recognized the signature in the lower left-hand corner as belonging to a little-known but not entirely untalented member of the so-called Eucalyptus School . <p> " Brings big bucks at auction . " <p> Klinger angled the painting to the light , saw that it had been retouched in several places , and realized that he was being hustled . <p> " Asking three fifty . " <p> Klinger returned the canvas to its resting place against the sliding door . <p> " Take three hundred . " <p> Klinger , who held himself aloof from the hype and haggling that accompanied flea market wheeling and dealing , cast a smile of polite disdain towards the side-view mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining alleys of the market before the arrival of mid-morning throngs made passage difficult . For the next hour , he continued to wend his watchful way , his eyes cutting a swath through the profusion of collectibles , memorabilia , and junk like a ship 's bow slicing the sea . He was turning into the next-to-last aisle at the far end of the market  --  a section set aside for sellers who had neglected to reserve locations in advance  --  when he spotted the corner of a hand-carved frame on the running board of an old pick-up truck . The truck had rounded fenders and a tiny cab and the frame was almost completely hidden behind a row of ancient garden tools  --  shovels , hoes , hay forks , rakes , scratchers , post-hole diggers , and the like-which had been propped for display against the side of the vehicle . Klinger approached the truck , bent down , and , peering through a fence of oak and ash handles , found himself staring at an eighteen-by-twenty-four Bierstadt study of Yosemite . <p> For a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting a finger with his tongue , he stuck it between the handles of a pair of corn hoes , and drew it gently across the faint outline of some lettering in the lower-right-hand corner of the painting , which was coated with a layer of grime . The saliva acted like one of those magical chemicals that brings legibility to invisible ink , and Bierstadt 's characteristic signature  --  the right-hand-downstroke of the initial A for Albert combined with the vertical stroke of the capital B  --  jumped to vivid vermilion life and glowed like a neon sign in Klinger 's soul . Straightening , he saw his own astonished face  --  as awestruck as the visage of a Vermeer savant-reflected in the window of the pickup . He could also see the outline of someone standing behind him . Trembling , he turned around and found himself looking into the weather-beaten face of a thin , wiry man whose triangular-shaped blue eyes squinted at him from beneath the brim of an old fedora . <p> " Them 's well made tools , " the man said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg your pardon , " Klinger replied , and tried to catch his breath . <p> " They do n't make tools like that these days . " <p> " No , they do n't , " Klinger heard himself say . The man before him had the wrinkled skin and wizened features of someone who has spent decades working in the sun . A denizen of the desert , Klinger thought . <p> " Sell you the corn hoe cheap . " <p> Klinger turned around and fingered the worn-smooth handle of the tool . " A fine implement , " he said . " Unfortunately , I do n't have a garden . " <p> " How about a rake for the yard ? " <p> " I live in an apartment , " Klinger replied . <p> " I thought you was looking at the tools , " the man said with a hint of reproach . <p> " It 's the painting I 'm interested in . " <p> " The painting 's not for sale . " <p> " Not for sale , " Klinger echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came and asked me to hold it while she went off to find her friends . That 's why it 's tucked away behind the tools . " <p> Klinger told himself to remain calm . " How much are you asking for it ? " he inquired . <p> " I told her fifty dollars . " <p> Klinger could scarcely believe his ears . The Bierstadt was worth at least a hundred thousand . " I 'll pay you twice your price , " he said . <p> The triangular blue eyes appraised him warily . " You some kind of dealer ? " <p> " No , " Klinger replied . " I collect old paintings . " <p> " Well , this one 's plenty old . " <p> " I can see that , " Klinger said politely . <p> " It belonged to an old lady out beyond Barstow who I used to give a ride into town to now and then , and help out with her chores . After she died , a nephew and his wife came up from Texas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to me , along with some tools and other stuff . " <p> Klinger was consumed by curiosity , but afraid of eliciting suspicion . " Were there other paintings in the house ? " <p> " It was an Air Stream and I never went inside , " the man in the fedora said . " She and her husband drove it down from up north before the War . They was hoping to find oil , but then he died and she stayed on . " <p> Klinger imagined the Bierstadt hanging for half a century in <p> silver trailer that , lost in a sea of desert scrub , flashed signals of reflected sunlight towards airliners passing overhead . Now , by some remarkable conjunction of the stars , it had been brought here by this gaunt-faced countryman , who was withholding it for reasons of honor . Klinger glanced fearfully about , half expecting to see an excited woman leading some equally animated people along the alley . " Perhaps the young lady you 're waiting for has changed her mind , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , " the man in the fedora replied . <p> Klinger was beside himself with anxiety and indecision . On the one hand , if he increased his offer , the man might begin to question the value he had placed upon the painting . On the other hand , the prospect of waiting around for someone to come by and claim it was intolerable . " How much longer do you feel you have to give her ? " he asked . <p> The man in the fedora sold a garden spade for five dollars to <p> couple wheeling a baby in a stroller . When the transaction had been completed , he turned to Klinger . " Ought to wait another few minutes . " <p> Klinger stole a look at the Bierstadt and shuddered to think of it falling into hands that might not know how to take care of it . He had heard of people trying to clean such paintings with soap and water , or , even worse , ammonia . The idea filled him with despair . " Suppose I raise my offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd want to keep my word , " the man replied . <p> " Two hundred , " Klinger said . The fact that the dream of all his sabbatical forays could hang in the balance of a promise made by someone more immune to hype and hustle than he , was an irony that seared his soul like acid burning into an etching plate . <p> The triangular blue eyes of the man in the fedora held Klinger in a troubled scrutiny . " That 's a lot of money , mister , " he said quietly . " Is there something about this picture I do n't know ? " <p> For a moment , the question lay athwart Klinger 's conscience like a mudslide across a road . To answer it directly was out of the question . To evade it was tantamount to engaging in the kind of flea-market deception for which he had always professed contempt . Out of the corner of his eye , Klinger saw several women hurrying along the alley , looking this way and that , as if for a lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet , withdrew a wad of twenty-dollar bills , and thrust them at the man in the fedora . " Two hundred and sixty dollars ! " he cried . " That 's all I brought . " <p> For several seconds , the man in the fedora stared at the fistful of bills without expression . Then the look of assent that Klinger hoped to see  --  desperately wanted to see  --  came over his face , and he took the money without a word . <p> The fleeting backward glance that Klinger allowed himself as he hurried away caused him to quicken his step . A tall , tanned woman with streaked blond hair , who wore blue jeans and a man 's white shirt , was standing before the man in the fedora , berating him with gestures and turning repeatedly to a younger woman beside her . The man in the fedora gave a mournful shrug and looked in Klinger 's direction , and Klinger saw the faces of the two women , as well as that of a third , swing towards him in unison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the three of them stared at him with the empty expressions of travelers watching a departing train they had hoped to catch ; then , urged on by the tall , tanned woman , they started after him . <p> Klinger did not look back again until he had drawn abreast of <p> concrete men 's room at the base of the stadium abutments . At that point , recognizing no one behind him , he decided that the women had become lost in the crowds surging through the aisles and thoroughfares of the flea market , or that they had resigned themselves to his having acquired the painting , and resumed their shopping . Then he caught sight of the tall , tanned woman , who , darting this way and that to avoid colliding with people in her path , was bearing down upon him . <p> Klinger immediately thought of seeking haven in the men 's room , but was deterred by fear of being accosted by unsavory characters who sometimes frequented such places , and of knowing that sooner or later he would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he broke into a half trot that became a hippety-hopping kind of canter as he heard a woman 's voice calling from behind him . <p> " Sir , I 'd like to talk to you . There 's something I think you ought to know . Sir  --  " <p> Looking straight ahead , Klinger scurried towards the exit gate by the ticket booths . <p> " Sir , please stop and listen to me ! " <p> The woman 's voice was strident now and almost in his ear , and Klinger saw that people had stopped to look . Realizing that they might think him to be in flight , he slowed his pace ; then he halted and turned slowly around . <p> " I beg your pardon , " he said . <p> The woman , who nearly ran into him , held her palms face out , as if imploring Klinger to wait until she had caught her breath . " I want to tell you something , " she said finally . " About that painting . " <p> Klinger found himself face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sun-browned cheekbones were laced with a network of tiny wrinkles which looked like the mosaic of fine fissures that accompanies the shrinking of tempera . A skin beyond restoration , he thought , and noticed that she wore a small tattoo on her forearm . " What is it you wish to tell me ? " he inquired . <p> " That painting was n't yours to buy . It was being saved for a friend of mine . " <p> " I purchased it directly from its owner , " Klinger said , inhaling the strong scent of jasmine perfume . <p> " But he was n't supposed to sell it to you . He was supposed to keep it for my friend . She saw it first . " <p> " Then your complaint is with the gentleman from whom I bought the painting . " <p> " He said he told you it was being saved . He said you offered him a lot of money . " <p> " That 's how I was able to buy it , " Klinger said . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's valuable , is n't it ? My friend here is an art student , and she thought it was when she told us about it . Now she 's devastated . " <p> The tall woman had been joined by two younger women , both of whom were wearing shorts and T-shirts . One was stocky and athletic-looking ; the other  --  a frail , pale-faced girl of about twenty , with tear streaks on her cheeks  --  was trying unsuccessfully not to cry . <p> " I 'm very sorry , " Klinger said , " but I must be on my way . " <p> The tall woman put an arm around the younger woman 's shoulder ; her lacquered fingernails dangled like a necklace on the girl 's breastbone . " She was right about the painting , was n't she ? " <p> " Excuse me , " Klinger said , and started away . <p> The tall woman stepped in front of him . " What 's the matter ? Are you afraid to talk about this with us ? " <p> The smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Madam , kindly allow me to pass . " <p> " All we 're asking is to have a civil discussion with you . " <p> " I have nothing further to say , " Klinger said . <p> The thin , pale-faced woman had bent over and was peering at the lower right-hand corner of the painting , which was visible at belt height just beyond Klinger 's left hip . " Oh , my God , " she wailed . " There 's his signature . It 's him ! " <p> Her head was so close to Klinger 's that he took an involuntary step backward and bumped into the other young woman , who promptly gave him a shove . <p> " Excuse me , " he said . <p> " Watch where you 're going , " she told him . <p> " Look at it ! " the pale-faced woman cried . " Right there ! " <p> Klinger drew the painting to his chest and enfolded it by crossing both arms in front of it . " This is outrageous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The tall woman looked him in the face . " You 're a creep , " she said softly . " You know that ? A mean , conniving creep . " <p> No woman had ever spoken to Klinger in such fashion  --  perhaps because , with the exception of his mother , his landlady , and a few colleagues at work , he had had little contact with women . He certainly had little knowledge of them . Women existed for Klinger chiefly in turn-of-the-century art-either as wistful contemplators of sundrenched flower gardens , or as tentative reflections in mirrors hung above their dressing tables , or as parasoled passengers languidly trailing their fingers as they were propelled in punts through rippleless waters . Now , unnerved by the anger of the tall woman with the sunravaged skin , he shrank within himself , as if he were witnessing the slashing of a canvas by one of those knife-wielding sociopaths who invade museums in search of substitutional revenge . A moment later , he was hurrying along an aisle that led towards the exit gate . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove followed just behind him , on either side , and kept up a running commentary . <p> " Creep , " the tall woman said . <p> " Thief , " the younger one added . <p> When Klinger drew close to the gate , he looked out across the parking lots at a sea of cartops gleaming in the sun , and , suddenly fearful of leaving the sanctuary of the flea market with its swarm of shoppers , turned into a thoroughfare that bordered the chain-link perimeter fence , and followed it like a trapped fish swimming around the rim of a purse seine . <p> The two women maintained a steady pace behind and on either side of him , and continued to assail him with epithets . <p> Klinger tried to ignore them as he thought of what to do . If only he had a confederate to whom he could hand the painting for safekeeping , but he had always pursued his quest alone , and there was no one in the flea market he could turn to now that he had found a Bierstadt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be able to call someone  --  his director , perhaps  --  and arrange to be met at a designated place near the exit gate . But the director lived in Santa Monica , an hour away , and even if he succeeded in explaining his predicament , the prospect of being surrounded by the hostile women as he fumbled to insert coins into the telephone , while trying to hold on to the painting and the receiver , posed a deterrent of paralyzing proportions . <p> " Cheat , " the tall woman hissed . <p> " Coward , " the younger one said . <p> Klinger wondered if he could possibly elude them long enough to stow away in one of the dealers ' trucks or vans , and then pay its owner to drive him out of the market at the end of the day . But anyone approached with such a proposition would surely assume that he had stolen the painting , and , besides , he had given the man in the fedora every bill in his wallet . <p> " Charlatan . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a clump of tethered balloons bobbing in the air above the awning of a refreshment stand , and , in a moment of cinematic fantasy , imagined his pursuers watching helplessly as he and the Bierstadt floated over the fence to freedom . Then he felt a sharp tug , as if someone had yanked upon the hem of his cardigan . When he felt the tug a second time , he decided that the women had escalated their harassment of him to an intolerable degree , and wheeled around to face them . <p> " Stop that ! " he demanded . " Leave me alone ! " <p> " Talk to us , " the tall woman said . <p> " Act like a man , " the younger one told him . <p> " You need help , ladies ? " a bystander called . <p> " He got something of yours ? " another asked . <p> Hugging the Bierstadt to his chest like a schoolgirl cradling her books , Klinger worried that the women might be trying to provoke an incident in the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that does n't belong to me , " he declared . But as he looked at the bemusement and skepticism in the faces of the people who had begun to gather in a circle around him , he was acutely aware that he had no receipt for the Bierstadt , that there had been no witnesses to the transaction except for the man in the fedora , and that his claim to own the painting rested upon nothing more than a fragile combination of assertion and possession . <p> The tall woman with the tattoo was studying him intently . " If that 's the case , why 're you running away ? " <p> Klinger was in a desperate hurry to be gone , but afraid to take a step . " I 'm not running away , " he said , indignantly . " I 'm going home . " <p> " Sure looked like you was in a hurry , " one of the bystanders observed . <p> " What 're you hiding there ? " another asked . <p> " Show us your treasure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not hiding anything , " he declared in a loud and forceful voice . " And I 'm not required to show you anything . " <p> The effect of his statement upon the onlookers surprised him . People close to him stopped pressing forward ; a few stepped back ; and some bystanders on the periphery of the crowd began to drift away . <p> Emboldened by this turnabout , Klinger addressed the tall woman with the tattoo . " If you interfere with me again , I 'll find a policeman , " he told her , and , striding quickly away , headed once again for the exit gate . <p> The two women followed close behind . <p> " Chickenshit , " the younger one said . <p> When he arrived at the gate , people were waiting in line to get the backs of their hands stamped , so that they could re-enter the flea market after leaving it . Klinger pushed past them through an opening in the chainlink fence , started across a stretch of tarmac , and found himself confronting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fedora had promised to save the painting . The unsettling possibility that she had been posted there , while the others flushed him from the market , filled him with foreboding . <p> But the young woman simply smiled at him . " Wo n't you talk to me ? " she asked . <p> Klinger glanced behind him and saw that the other two had stopped just outside the gate , and were watching them . " Young lady , your friends have provoked and insulted me , " he said . " Why on earth should I talk to you ? " <p> " They were angry because I was upset , " she replied . " But I feel better now , and if I could just talk to you for a few minutes about the painting and what happened  --  " <p> Klinger took a deep breath , as if he were inhaling a sigh . On the one hand , he wanted nothing more than to get into his car , and , with the Bierstadt tucked safely on the seat beside him , gain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young woman was obviously troubled , and the risk of talking to her for a moment or two seemed mitigated by the presence of a booted , helmeted motorcycle cop , who was standing with legs apart , arms akimbo , and face masked by sunglasses , just a few feet away , beside a shiny black machine whose radio crackled with unintelligible authority as he surveyed the crowd entering the flea market . <p> " Very well , " Klinger said . " What is it you you wish to know ? " <p> " First of ail , is it really a painting by Albert Bierstadt ? " <p> " It has certainly been executed in his style , " Klinger replied . " And the signature appears to be authentic . Of course , to be absolutely certain , one would have to examine it with an ultraviolet backlight . " <p> " I knew when I saw it that it was special . I did n't know it was a Bierstadt , because I could n't make out the signature , but I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good eye , " Klinger told her , reassuringly . <p> " I 've taken courses and gone to a lot of exhibits . Or maybe I saw something by him in a book . " <p> " Always trust your eye , " Klinger said . <p> " But I did n't . I trusted the man who sold it to you to save it for me while I went to get the money to buy it from my friends . " <p> Klinger glanced at the other two women , who were still watching from the gate . " You must n't blame yourself , " he told her . " The painting is very dirty . Anyone could have missed it . " <p> " You did n't . " <p> Klinger found himself touched by the self-reproach in her voice . <p> " I 've had a great deal of experience with paintings , " he said . " I 've been searching for one like this for a very long time . " <p> " What are you going to do with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean it . " <p> " And then ? " <p> " I really do n't know , " Klinger replied , but even as he spoke , he imagined the Bierstadt hanging in a place of honor in the museum , next to a small plaque that read , " From the collection of  --  " <p> " I bet you 'll sell it , " the young woman said evenly . " I bet you 'll sell it for a ton of money . " <p> " I have no plans to do that , " Klinger told her , and stole a look at the motorcycle cop , who was still standing beside his machine . <p> " How much d' you think it 's worth ? " <p> Klinger shrugged . " I have no idea . " <p> " Ten thousand ? " <p> Klinger smiled at the paucity of the estimate . <p> " Twenty ? " <p> Klinger shook his head in amused disbelief . <p> " Thirty ? " <p> She was challenging him with a crescendo of interrogatives obviously designed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Klinger decided to put an end to it . " If you wish to know what Bierstadt brings at auction , these days , I suggest you call Butterfield and Butterfield , or Sotheby 's . " <p> " So it is worth a lot of money . " <p> Klinger rolled his eyes in dismay as he realized the trap she had set for him . " Young lady , I ' m beginning to find you as impertinent as your friends . " <p> " Why not just admit that it 's worth a lot of money ? " <p> " It may well be , " Klinger told her , icily . " Indeed , I sincerely hope so . " <p> The young woman looked crestfallen again . " All I 'm asking is for you to be fair . You know I saw it first , and we both know it 's valuable , so why ca n't we go shares ? " <p> Klinger peered with amazement at her over the frame of the painting , which he continued to hug to his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Not fifty-fifty , " she said . " But if you would just agree to give me a fair share of what you make when you sell it , I could use the money for school . " <p> " Young lady , this is not some lottery ticket bought in allotment . This is a painting purchased with cash . " <p> " Does that make it right what you did ? " <p> " Right ? " Klinger echoed . So it had come down to a question of ethics posed by a young woman who pretended to be unaware of the freewheeling realities of the flea market . " It means that I bought this painting and that it 's mine . " <p> " Dog eat dog , " she said softly . <p> " Rules of the game , " Klinger told her , and glanced again at the motorcycle cop . <p> " Dog eat dog , " she said again , and , looking in the direction of her friends , gave a shrug and a shake of her head . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women by the gate start towards him . He intended to tolerate no further indignities , but to swallow his pride , tell the policeman as succinctly as possible what had transpired since he had bought the painting , and ask to be escorted to his car . He was almost close enough to see his own reflection in the convex sunglasses that bifurcated the cop 's impassive face , when the motorcycle radio blared out an alarm and the policeman , propelled from immobility , mounted his machine , planted his buttocks in the saddle , and sped away with a roar that drowned out Klinger 's belated call for help . <p> To gain the parking lot where he had left his car , Klinger had to cross a bridge that spanned a concrete-lined spillway designed to carry runoff from the surrounding hills . When he reached the other side , he turned into the first lane of the parking lot , glanced back , and saw the three women close behind . It was mid-morning and although the lot was full of cars , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the flea market . Heat from the rising sun rebounded from the macadam and a strong glare was reflected from row upon row of automobile rooftops and windshields . As he hurried along , Klinger searched for the sapling that marked the location of his own vehicle , and , spotting it two rows over , ran at a crouch behind a pair of cars to the next lane , which was empty in both directions . Still running at a crouch , like a soldier seeking the shelter of a trench in no man 's land , he passed behind another set of cars and emerged into the open in the third lane . There , to his left , he saw the stocky young woman in shorts , loping towards him , not forty yards away . <p> He knew exactly where his car was now , and , throwing caution to the wind , he raced towards it at a gallop . Sweat ran down over his forehead and trickled into his eyes , and his chest heaved as he gasped for air . When he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wiped his brow with the sleeve of his cardigan , and fumbled to insert the door key into its lock . He was clutching the Bierstadt to his breast with one hand , and trying to find the opening of the lock with the other , when he heard footsteps on the macadam , and , momentarily distracted , allowed the keys to slip from his grasp and drop to the pavement . As he bent over to pick them up , the blunt toe of a running shoe kicked at them and sent them skidding . Turning in that direction , he saw them scooped up by the talon-nailed hand of the tall woman and tossed skyward in an arc that culminated with a clatter on the rooftop of an adjacent car . <p> Too stunned to protest , and breathing too heavily to shout for help , Klinger sank to his knees . Perspiration smarted his eyes and the scent of the women  --  the smell of jasmine competing with the sweat of exertion  --  filled his nostrils as they hovered above him , breathless as he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from limb . Closing his eyes , he hugged the Bierstadt to him as if it were a shield , and , while waiting for the first blow  --  a slap upon the face , perhaps , or a slash of fingernails across his cheek  --  decided that if necessary he would relinquish the painting to protect himself . Desolate with the sense of impending loss , he found himself thinking that several months hence the Rose Bowl would be swollen with sound as vast crowds greeted changes of possession among helmeted gladiators with roars of approval and groans of disappointment , but that in his case there would merely be a slight scuffling noise as he allowed his dream to be stripped from him and borne away . The onslaught of the women remained in the realm of anticipation , however , and when he opened his eyes , a few seconds later , he saw that they were not only backing warily away , but also looking at him with dismay , as if they had already inflicted wounds too awful to contemplate . <p> Klinger watched their cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turning of their backs in unison , and a sprint that soon carried them out of sight behind a row of cars . Dazed by his unexpected deliverance from their fury , he struggled to his feet , retrieved his keys , and unlocked the door on the driver 's side of the car . He had unlatched and opened the rear door and was propping the Bierstadt against the back seat , when he noticed a flap of peeled canvas , and turning the painting around , saw that the golden sunrise at its center had been rent by a large L-shaped tear . <p> For a moment , Klinger 's face mirrored the shock of recognition he had seen on the faces of the women as they had backed away from the lacerated painting , aware that it had been maimed during the commotion that accompanied the kicking away of his car keys . Now , he not only understood why they had fled , but also that he had been spared the consequences of their wrath by the mutilation of the very thing he and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the rear door of the car , climbed into the driver 's seat , and started up the engine . In this mood , the events of the morning unraveled before him as a series of foreordained steps that , culminating in desecration , had begun when his desperate offer of cash had persuaded the man in the fedora to sell him the Bierstadt he had promised to hold for someone else . But as he left the parking lot of the Rose Bowl behind , and drove up through the Pasadena Hills towards the freeway , it occurred to him that he  --  almost alone  --  possessed the skill to repair the injury . Yes , only he could perform the kind of surgery that would be required to mend the Bierstadt . <p> Klinger imagined himself carefully trimming torn threads at the edges of the jagged wound , applying poultices to reduce the adjacent swelling , grafting layers of patching to ensure a proper suture , and then laying on pigments to disguise the scar that disfigured the golden glow Bierstadt had painted at the very heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freeway , he saw that the sun of this particular day had begun to burn through the smog that hung over Los Angeles , and soon found himself descending towards the city . The road ahead was a roller coaster of elation and despair which attended the knowledge that he could heal the painting so that the damage would be invisible  --  to any eye but his . <p>
