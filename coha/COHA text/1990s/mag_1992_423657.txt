Section : B.E . SPECIAL REPORT ON SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Ten common problems that can destroy your business and what you can do to stop them . <p> Juliet C. Welker was on top of the world . One of six winners of Avon 's Third Annual Women of Enterprise Awards in 1988 , she had made Welker Real Estate the envy of every Philadelphia broker . <p> By early 1989 , however , things had changed . The real estate market had slowed and the company 's sales had dropped off significantly . Over four months , Welker 's commercial and residential business dropped 30% . Her monthly goal of 12 to 15 closings came up short . Eight to 10 closings seemed more realistic . Even the average sale price of a property suffered , plunging from $118,000 to $104,500 . <p> " Sales had been dropping off because the country had been going into a recession . Then on top of the recession that was beginning , Philadelphia increased its transfer tax sales tax on real estate sales.At that time , the combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Welker says . To complicate matters , Welker had n't paid attention to her income statements and did n't know about the slump . " It 's embarrassing , " Welker now says . " I literally forgot to watch . When I saw the equity account dwindling , I was utterly shocked . We were so caught up in our own success that I was almost ignoring the monthly report . " <p> Had Welker been less solvent she could have gone out of business . She managed to turn things around by implementing cost controls and aggressively seeking new business . But not every business owner wakes up in time to avert disaster . Depending on which survey you read , 60% to 90% of small businesses fail . But if you stake out some business-survival territory in advance , you can avoid failure . <p> Here are 10 disasters an entrepreneur can face and clues to get past them . <p> 1 . Deadbeat customers . According to Nina Douglas at the American Collectors Association ( ACA ) in Minneapolis , about 232 million accounts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs the economy about $250 annually for every person in the country , ACA says . <p> Figures like these call for strong credit controls . A 30-day cycle for receivables is priority , says Al Harris , owner of Erik-A Electronic Distributor Inc. in Monrovia , Calif . Erik-A is an electronic components wholesaler that sells items such as fuses , batteries and resistors to major manufacturers  --  Hughes Aircraft Co. , Northrop Corp . and Litton Industries among them . " There are a lot of companies that will stretch your receivables , Thirty days can become 90 , and they still take the discount , " he says . Harris routinely meets with the management of prospective trade customers before doing business with them . Building a relationship with clients discourages them from exploiting his billing cycle . <p> " In this time of recession everybody is trying to use everybody else 's money , " says Nelson Davis , producer of " MAKING IT : Minority Success Stories , " a syndicated television show that profiles minority entrepreneurs . He 's seen dead-beat trouble from the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency I dealt with , " Davis explains . " We were also doing business with their largest account . We knew that their account was paying them in a timely fashion , but they were not paying us in turn . So we know they were u sing that as their financial float for expansion . " <p> " We tried to collect , " he recalls , " without getting results from the agency . So we simply let our client  --  their client  --  know . The payment since then has been better . " <p> Solving collections problems before they start is more than good advice . The nuisance of small claims court , the 30% to 50% fee that collection agencies take and the loss of good customer relations are far greater risks to a small firm . <p> 2 . Employee theft . Shrinkage is what grocers and restaurateurs call shoplifting and internal theft . According to Wilbur Rykert , director of the National Crime Prevention Institute in Louisville , Ky. , shoplifting accounts for only 10% of most loss . Employee or internal theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenience employees , but Rykert says the cost of good security more than covers potential losses . " The entrepreneur , " he explains , " needs to have an understanding with his employees that they serve each other 's interests , and that if the losses continue there will be no business and no jobs . " <p> 3 . Depending too much on one client . This is an especially big danger for government-procurement contractors and agency businesses , such as advertising and executive recruiting agencies . If your biggest client goes broke or changes vendors , you could sink . <p> Erik-A 's 14-year survival and $4.1 million in annual sales owe a lot to Harris ' aggressive bidding on government and corporate contracts . " The broadness of your customer base is vitally , vitally important , " says CEO Al Harris , who boasts a mix of about 400 clients . " In order to stay in business for a long time , you have to be able to increase sales , especially during lean times . " <p> Emma C. Chappell , founder , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees . In 30 years of banking , Chappell has seen business after business fail because they based their existence on a single contract . <p> Chappell recommends that a firm with one deal under its belt use it as a " leading contract " to get additional business . She recalls the owners of a childcare service who almost went broke : " They had a one-year contract , and they thought it would be renewed over the next five years . I talked to them about developing relationships with other groups , such as a corporation that could not set up a center on its own . " <p> When a big buyer encourages a small supplier to develop other customers , it is often fair  --  if indirect  --  warning that the business relationship is under review . Davis cites a Southern California telephone carrier that started hinting to one of its minority vendors that " things may change . The vendor 's first reaction was anger . But if he had heeded the advice of never letting one customer become more than 40% of his business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Bad cash management . It 's tempting to spend income on oneself instead of the business . Entrepreneurs with the longest-lived businesses put as much as possible into working capital . <p> " Harris also stresses the need for a sufficient  --  and manageable  --  credit line . " When we first opened in 1979 , Hughes was going to give us a $10,000 order . I did n't have the cash to go out and purchase the products first , so I went to the bank and explained my problem . " Since he could repay the money with interest within 30 days , the bank extended him a line of credit . Harris warns , however : " If you get yourself in a situation where you always have to borrow money in order to do business , the cost of money can be very expensive . " <p> Chappell says that all businesses should zero in on bad cash management . She recommends sitting down with bankers and accountants for formal strategy sessions . She also believes a written business plan is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you an opportunity to put on paper exactly what you want for that business . Refer back to it from time to time to see if you 're getting where you want to be . People are optimistic about how much profit they 're going to make early on . Very often it does n't happen as fast as they expected it to . " ( For more information on developing a business plan , see " A Good Plan Is Key To Business Success " and " Go with the Flow  --  Or Else , " BE November 1991 . ) <p> 5 . Ignoring what your financials tell you . You do n't have to be an accountant , but you ought to know your way around at least two financial statements  --  the income or profit and loss ( P &L); statement , which shows how much money came in and was spent over a span of time ; and a balance sheet , which shows how much money you 've got and where atone point in time . <p> Says Davis : " Many people find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up a certain amount of financial work to others , especially in the smallest of business . Most people fear financial theft because they give up control and the certainty of their own numbers . The Los Angeles riots pointed out something dramatically , that the record keeping of most small businesspeople is terrible . Many of them are having trouble getting SBA Loans for rebuilding , and a lack of good records is the biggest single reason for black businesspeople . " <p> That 's why experts advise you to develop an ongoing relationship with your accountant ; do n't wait till tax time . " You should generate a minimum of one income statement every month , " says Jim Watkins , an Atlanta-area retirement and tax accountant who gives financial seminars at Clayton State College 's Small Business Development Center . Watkins has designed a simple method for monitoring money by using the income statement , balance sheet and general ledger , which he says is sufficient for most small firms . <p> Income statements help only if you pay attention to them . If Juliet Welker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could have tightened her budget four months earlier than she did . She could have decreased the size of ads that were n't getting response . She could have decreased clerical support gradually and ordered , say , three instead of six months ' worth of office supplies at once . As she notes : " You should have a budget to tell you what you should be making and spending . If it 's 10% to 20% off , two months in a row , you need to understand why . Then go to those discretionary expenditures and adjust them . " <p> 6 . Poor location . Every retailer in America knows how important a good location is . But a bad location can wreck any kind of business . United Bank 's Chappell recalls a small manufacturer of directional signs for highways . The company was located in an outlying area with low rents . " I told him that at that location , people who had to make decisions in the city had to come a long way out to his location and lose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans With Disabilities Act is law , most business sites also will have to comply with requirements that they be fully accessible to disabled patrons and employees . That 's an extra factor to consider when choosing an address  --  or negotiating a lease for one . <p> 7 . Inadequate insurance . Insurance is not getting any cheaper , but if you plan right , insurance costs can be analyzed  --  sometimes even controlled . Many small firms do n't offer employees any health insurance . Others share the cost with workers . But Harris , who has 18 employees , considers medical insurance " a standard employee benefit and a way of keeping good employees . " <p> Shop around for a broker who represents more than one insurer , and negotiate whenever you can . Also , request liability-coverage discounts for such practices as perfect safety records and on-the-job training . ( You 'll have to ask ; insurers do n't always advertise price breaks . ) <p> Watkins suggests taking a look at the legal and tax structure of your business from time to time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are in a sole proprietorship , partnership or S corporation , " he explains , " you have a 25% limit on the write-off you can take on health insurance . If you are a C corporation , you can take off 100% . " <p> 8 . Ignoring government regulations . When Al Harris started Erik-A , he planned from the beginning to do business with the government . He wanted to be sure that the components he sold met Uncle Sam 's stringent quality specs . " We went to several government facilitities and said , Make us understand the rules . ' We asked for a meeting with the procurement office , and got all the information we needed . " <p> How much regulation you encounter depends on your industry . But it 's a mistake to ignore the government , whether fire department , OSHA ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration ) , the local zoning commission or the Environmental Protection Agency . Steve Tekosky , who specializes in environmental law at Cadwalader , Wickersham &; Taft in Los Angeles , notes that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherewithal to hire in-house consultants or be aware of ever-changing and ever-more-complex regulations . " <p> But stay ahead they must . Carol Dinkins practices law in Houston , at Vinson &; Elkins . She recalls that a few years ago she represented a client who started a yacht-sales business . " He just did n't know the regulations about filling in wetland areas along the coastline , " she says . The client had built a dock and filled in the area behind it , but he did not have the right permits . Dinkins had to answer a federal cease-and-desist order , and after about 60 days of negotiation ( at the client 's expense ) managed to work out a permit-compliance arrangement . " It was a tough lesson for him , " Dinkins says . <p> Ironically , the more regulated your industry is , the more likely you are to find books , newsletters and seminars to help cut a path through bureaucracy . Trade association membership in a regulated industry also will buy up-to-the-minute details of the latest in compliance , procedures and programs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pay a dozen or so different kinds of taxes and be required to submit as many periodic returns . Employment taxes , however , are by far the most important payments a small business makes during the year . Accountant Watkins says that not paying payroll taxes is the single biggest reason that companies fail : " A person will run short on cash at the end of the month ; so what does not get paid ? The IRS . " <p> Tax management is n't simply a matter of filing payroll taxes . It also involves retirement planning , profit sharing and , as we saw earlier , even health-insurance planning . Tax management is also bound up with cash management ; just as an income statement helps you judge how you 're managing your money , so a balance sheet helps you evaluate your tax options . <p> 10 . Poor employee management . Miscommunication creates confusion , resentment , high turnover , even employee theft . On the other hand , good hiring practices , clear personnel policies , training and information sharing can spark extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welker had to motivate employees to look for more buyers and at the same time do what she calls " internal reorganization . " <p> She started holding brainstorming sessions with employees . " People may think the company 's doing fine . They do n't think about gas , phone , electricity , secretarial pay . What worked was making them aware , then helping them think of ways to increase their own bottom line . " Welker still has regular staff meetings to talk about how to improve business . <p> Al Harris goes even further . He has three plans , updated constantly . " One should be a short-range plan , with accomplishable goals you 're trying to meet within a one-year period . Secondly , you should have a middle-range plan , with goals that you can reach within a five-year period . Thirdly , you should have a long-range plan , for 10 years and beyond . These are plans I share with the employees . I want employees to know the direction the company is going . " <p> Of course , bankers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business for you . But if you do n't take anybody 's advice about watching money , employees , government red tape or other factors of success  --  and then fail  --  you ca n't expect much sympathy . Philadelphia banker Emma Chappell has a word to the wise : " People have to be self-sufficient , independent , and I understand that , " she says . " They have to do their business the way they think is appropriate . But if they do n't take advice and failure happens , then I do n't feel any concern about it . " <p> ILLUSTRATIONS ( 4 ) ( JOHN BREAKEY ) <p> By CARYNE BROWN <p> MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES HOW TO WRITE A WINNING BUSINESS PLAN <p> To avoid making costly mistakes , entrepreneurs should develop a business plan to guide their firm 's growth and development .

Construct graphs , tables and charts to illustrate your findings and include them in your plan . FIGURE YOUR START-UP COSTS . Estimate both the start-up and future costs of running your business . Factor in at least three months ' worth of raw materials , office space , supplies , salaries , taxes , marketing , etc . Do n't overlook legal and accounting fees .
