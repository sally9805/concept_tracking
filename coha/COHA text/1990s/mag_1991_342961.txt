From his podium at New York City 's Lincoln Center last week , Raymond Leppard gave a brisk downbeat and drew forth the majestic D that opens the " Haffner " Symphony . In doing so , he began the gala observance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's 235th birthday . He also began an unprecedented Lincoln Center extravaganza : to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Mozart 's death by performing during the next 19 months every note he ever wrote . <P> Leppard 's lively performance of the " Haffner , " with a scaled-down orchestra assembled from the New York Philharmonic and the Juilliard School Orchestra , was peculiar because it broke off after the minuet . Then came two piano concertos , two piano solos , a serenade and four individual arias ( all admirably performed by such soloists as pianist Jeffrey Kahane and soprano Dawn Upshaw ) before the " Haffner " finale arrived as a kind of farewell . <P> This sort of programming was standard in Mozart 's day , and Leppard was inaugurating the bicentennial by re-creating a concert that Mozart himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the theater could not have been more crowded , and that every box was full , " the composer proudly wrote to his father Leopold ( which is why we know the details of the program ) . " But what pleased me most of all was that His Majesty the Emperor was present , and goodness ! how delighted he was and how he applauded me ! " <P> The Mozart bicentennial ranges far beyond Manhattan . On the same day that the " Haffner " was resounding in Lincoln Center , Mozart 's " Prague " Symphony poured forth in Prague , and nine other European cities chimed in with concerts of their own . Then all 10 performances were broadcast in sequence over a continentwide network , so that Europeans with grandiose Mozart plans of their own could start their celebrations . <P> The rest of the world has its claims too , for though Mozart was very much the child of the 18th century enlightenment in Austria , he is probably the most universally beloved of classical composers . So while there will be concerts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and Paris , there will also be Mozart festivals in more unexpected places , ranging from Bartlesville , Okla. , to Dunedin , New Zealand . When all the cheering finally dies , this will probably have been the largest and loudest celebration of any artist in human history . Says one New Yorker who prefers Puccini : " Where can I hide ? " <P> Mozart has not always been so universally popular . Though he was famous during childhood as a keyboard virtuoso , his myriad compositions were often regarded as dense and difficult ( " Too many notes , my dear Mozart , " Emperor Joseph II supposedly said ) . Musicians , however , recognized his greatness . " I love Mozart as the musical Christ , " said Tchaikovsky . " The most tremendous genius raised Mozart above all masters , " said Wagner , " in all centuries and in all the arts . "
