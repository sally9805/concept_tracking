<p> The second skirmish of the Soviet Civil War , following " Bloody Sunday " in Lithuania , took place this week in Russian-occupied Riga , Latvia . <p> " Black Beret " troops , personally loyal to the dictator Gorbachev , staged a pre-dawn assault on police headquarters , killing 5 and wounding 10 . A cameraman filming the murders  --  the nation 's leading filmmaker  --  was also killed . The excuse : the Latvians had not turned in all their arms . The penalty : massacre . <p> In Moscow , the dictator held a no-questions news conference . He denied , as usual , that the command had come from him , offered crocodile-tear condolences and called for an investigation . That whitewash-to-come will find that sleeping Latvians provoked the attack and deserved to die . <p> Who are those Black Berets ? They are perestroika 's Praetorian Guard , formed three years ago to be Gorbachev 's goons if other , more regular troops refused to kill protesting civilians . Last week a tank division of the Red Army stationed in Byelorussia refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed no inclination to do dirty work on civilians , especially after Boris Yeltsin called on Russian soldiers to refuse orders to fire on crowds . <p> This then became a job for Mr. Gorbachev 's hand-picked Interior Minister , Boris Pugo  --  " the new Beria "  --  and the Black Berets directly under his command . These are not elite soldiers  --  indeed , they would cut and run if faced by organized units of any army  --  but are bully-boys with a criminal mindset similar to the Nazi S.S. , eager to smash and kill defenseless civilians , courageous cameramen or local police . <p> When the K.G.B . in Riga sent a couple of operatives to the apartment of Dainis Ivans , head of the independence-minded Popular Front and the most popular political figure in Latvia , the agents found him gone . <p> That was because the elected Parliament placed the power to form a Latvian government-in-exile in his hands , to be used if the Gorbachev crackdown leads to a puppet regime ; it sent him with his family to sanctuary in Sweden , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Ivans , along with his Lithuanian counterpart , is now in the U.S. to plead for our Government 's backing in resisting Moscow 's war on his people . <p> He 's not getting it . The Baltics will continue to get lip service , bland statements from the White House about how we are " deeply troubled " about the Kremlin 's reversion to type , but no diplomatic recognition  --  not even a pledge to link a Moscow summit to a visit to Riga . Mr. Ivans is being listened to but not heard . <p> We had lunch the other day in Washington . A year ago we met in his Riga apartment , where he was home writing his country 's declaration of independence and early in my agitation for Baltic independence . Today he is still a determined idealist , but no longer the crusading journalist and environmentalist ; he is the elected Vice President of a nation victimized by Kremlin duplicity . Like his compatriots , he has no more illusions about glasnost or rosy promises of peaceful dialogue on the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this 35-year-old leader , are telling the Balts not to expect any help from the U.S.  --  that we will be tied up in a long , unsuccessful war in the Persian Gulf . Lest the Baltic peoples do not believe this , the Gorbachev Black Berets will take over the local broadcasting facilities , as they did on Lithuania 's " Bloody Sunday . " <p> Mr. Ivans says the Latvians have barricaded themselves at broadcasting facilities as well as around their Parliament . " At first we will make peaceful resistance , but if they shoot our people , we will organize volunteers and we will defend ourselves . They 'll have to shoot us all . " <p> Brave words , but what of the half of Latvia 's population not ethnic Latvian ? Will it go along with the quisling Pugo and his Black Berets ? " Russians are joining us on the barricades . Two of the policemen killed were Russian . Gorbachev has brought us together against Communism and him . " <p> Freedom is not won by television interviews , or by pleas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The terrible truth is that freedom is most often won on the barricades , after sacrifice , when real soldiers come to the rescue of countrymen being savaged by the dictator 's killers , and when outsiders are shamed into diplomatic support . <p> " The tree of liberty , " wrote Thomas Jefferson , " must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . " Mikhail Gorbachev is making that sad conclusion of 1787 hold true in 1991.
