When Hatch , the band 's songwriter , comes down with a bad case of writer 's block , can his buddy Barney convince him it 's all in his mind ? // Barney , I 'm finished ! I 've written my last song ! " Hatch Peabody said despairingly . I 'd walked in and found Hatch sitting in his room , staring at the wall . He had spent most of the last two weeks there . Hatch writes the songs for our band , The Mathematics , but now he had a bad case of songwriter 's block . I 'd tried every way I knew to cheer him up and pull him out of it , but nothing had worked . I said , " I came to tell you a story and take your mind off your troubles . " I 'd just come from my uncle 's , and boy , did I have a story ! " That wo n't work either , " said Hatch . " I ca n't solve my problem by dodging it . A rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've run dry . " I told him the story anyhow . " My uncle has to fly a lot on business for his company , and he 's always had a fear of flying . Every time he even saw an airplane , he would break out in a sweat . So he got this subliminal tape .... " " Sub-what ? " " SUB-LIM-I-NAL ! Hatch , you could at least pay attention . When you play a subliminal tape , you hear only music , or maybe random sounds . But underneath there 's a second recording , a voice that only the subconscious mind can pick up . And this voice tells you that you can overcome your fear or solve your problem . It 's a little like hypnosis , or those whistles that only dogs can hear . " " So your uncle played a tape and overcame his fear of flying . Big deal . " " Right ! Do n't you think that 's great , Hatch ? " " What I think is-our band is finished . " But halfway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problem staring me right in the face . " Let 's get you a subliminal tape , " I said , " for overcoming songwriter 's block . " " Barney , you 're so crazy about high-tech stuff , you think there 's an electronic solution to every problem . " " I wo n't deny that , " I said , " but what have you got to lose ? " He was quiet for a minute , then he shrugged . " You 're right . I have nothing to lose . " I dragged him downstairs to the phone , then I called every place in town that sold tapes . " Songwriter 's block ? " they all said . " Never heard of it ! " " How about just plain writer 's block ? " I asked . " Nope . " They had tapes for overcoming fear of snakes , of dogs , of swimming in deep water . They had tapes to help you lose weight , study more effectively , or overcome shyness . The last man thought my idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape to overcome a fear of strawberries ? Or a fear of chocolate fudge ? " " This is no joke ! " I shot back . Before I had really thought about it , I said , " I 'll make my own tape ! " and I hung up . When I turned around , Hatch was looking at me . " Can you do that , Barney ? " Actually , I could n't . My recording gear was n't good enough , but-it hit me-Hatch did n't know that ! " Sure , " I said , " I 'll double dub and overplay the primary track with the secondary , reducing the volume and editing out overtones for clarity . " It was double-talk , pure baloney , but Hatch went for it . " Wow , " he said . I went home for my portable tape recorder . All I 'd need to do was use the power of suggestion . What was a subliminal tape anyhow ? Just the power of suggestion . I was back in 15 minutes . " Hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I handed him the microphone . He really got into it . The idea had grabbed his imagination . " I used to be a songwriter , " he said . " I had creative powers before , and I can have them again . This band needs me ! I must use my inner resources and rise to the occasion . I can write songs again ! I will write songs again ! " When he stopped , I said , " Say it over and over again , 10 or 15 times . " And he did . Talk about the power of suggestion ! After half an hour , I said : " Great ! That 'll do it . You want to help me record the second track ? " But he still wanted to sit in his room , so I left him there . Nothing about him had changed so far . I put Hatch 's recording in my pocket and snapped a clean tape into the machine . I figured hearing music might depress Hatch , so I made the second tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of town , there 's a nice little waterfall . That made a great five minutes of sound . Across the street from the bridge is a field where you can always hear meadowlarks . There were some cardinals and finches around too-a regular bird orchestra . I recorded six minutes of that . My grandpa has an old hand pump out back that squeaks and squeals when you pump . I went by and taped the sound of the pump , and also the sound of my grandpa laughing . He thought the whole idea was pretty funny . Grandpa took me to his neighbor who had a box full of new puppies yipping and yapping . I had no trouble filling the tape . I finished up with the sounds of a boy tinkering on his bicycle . Then I went back to my house and buried the recording of Hatch 's voice behind my socks in a drawer . To kill time , I sat down to practice guitar chords . I did n't know how long it took to put two recordings together into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , I went over and gave him the tape . " That was quick , Barney , " he said . " The overplay meshed with the digital audio without even one glitch in the sound bites , " I told him . More baloney . " Just remember , you wo n't actually hear the recording of your voice . " Then I left . I was afraid if I hung around , he might start asking questions I could n't answer . Results were almost immediate . Hatch called me early the next morning . He 'd spent most of the night listening to that tape ! " Did it work ? " I asked . For his answer , he started singing me the new song he 'd just written . It was called " Rockin ' Around My Town , " and it was great ! He had half a dozen more ideas for other songs too . " It was the power of suggestion , " I said . " You kept remembering all that good advice you gave yourself on the tape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the environmental sounds that did it . Barney , the world is too big and beautifuland noisy-to sit in your room and feel sorry for yourself . " I said , " Maybe your ear picked up the audio interlock on the primary for playback following noise reduction . " That 's double-talk for , " whatever works , works . " <p>
