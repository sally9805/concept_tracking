Some U.S. intelligence officials believe North Korea has resumed a serious effort to build nuclear weapons . Evidence from multiple sources has persuaded them that leader KIM JONG IL is pushing the construction of a new reactor  --  underground to confound U.S. spy satellites  --  and trying to design usable atom bombs , possibly including missile warheads . Other analysts disagree ; some Clinton Administration officials think hard-liners are leaking these reports to choke off congressional support for oil shipments to North Korea , which the U.S. pledged to fund in 1994 as part of a deal that shut down Pyongyang 's known nuclear program . Even if the bad news is true , the new reactor is not expected to generate more bombmaking material for several years . But if North Korea is able to design a working bomb , analysts generally believe it stockpiled enough plutonium before 1994 to build one or two of them . <P>  --  By J.F.O.
