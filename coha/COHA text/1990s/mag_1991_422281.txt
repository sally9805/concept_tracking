Section : Cover story A Supreme Court nominee-and the nominating system-on trial <p> A painful public reunion with millions watching was not what anyone had planned : He , the self-made conservative Supreme Court nominee , defending his good name ; she , the up-from-poverty legal scholar , accusing her former boss of " dirty ' and " disgusting " behavior . Senate Judiciary Committee members were on trial , too , as members of a 98 percent male Senate club , accused of burying the accusations and being unable to understand the power of the charges of sexual harassment . It was a dirty circus , even by Washington standards . And when the public airing concluded , the stench lingered . <p> Never before had a nominee for the Supreme Court told the Senate it could take the job and shove it . " Confirm me if you want , " Clarence Thomas declared defiantly . " Do n't confirm me if you are so led . ' At first , he sounded almost ready to withdraw , but it was clear he was fighting mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost beside the point ; Thomas 's rage was directed at the system . In a righteous fury , he told his judges that their hearing was a " national disgrace .... You are ruining the country . ' He had been a victim , he said , of the vitriol of the left . His message : " Unless you kowtow to an old order ... you will be lynched , destroyed , caricatured by a committee of the Senate rather than hung from a tree . ' The claims of his accuser , Anita Hill , were " unequivocally , uncategorically " wrong . He had not even watched her testimony . <p> Hill had given the most lurid description of any man 's behavior that had ever been witnessed on network TV . The University of Oklahoma law professor told of a man who once pressed her for dates and then , when she refused , brought up sexual matters . " He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts , ' she said . " On other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penis as being larger than normal and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex . ' Her disgust was so great , she said , that she wound up in the hospital because of " stress on the job . " <p> The nation was riveted by their testimony , and the host of witnesses for both sides . To some , Hill was Everywoman , the proxy for all who had ever had a degrading or threatening encounter with a male co-worker . To others , Thomas was the symbol of the devastation wrought by Washington 's investigative machine run amok . <p> Someone had to be lying  --  or shading , or not remembering . Yet both witnesses seemed compelling in their own defense . Whatever the verdict , the fallout would be considerable : enlightening the rules of engagement between men and women ( story , Page 38 ) ; spreading the public 's already mammoth disgust with government ; forcing a re-examination of the confirmation process for high office . At the White House , aides quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the president would attack the Senate 's handling of Thomas . In this , he would not be alone . " This is not advise and consent , ' an anguished Sen. John Danforth , Thomas 's patron , told his colleagues . " This is slash and burn . " <p> The Thomas affair is not just the story of one woman 's testimony . It is the story of a system degraded by all its participants : the White House handlers trying to mute any discussion of the nominee 's judicial philosophy , the congressional staffers searching for dirt , special interests looking to defeat the nomination to further their own causes . The administration 's game plan was to make Thomas 's triumphs over poverty and racism the key credentials . That left Thomas testifying that he had no opinion on almost everything , including Roe v. Wade . Character questions , always important , were the only way to strike at him . And it turned out that the biography that was to be his salvation included a chapter that could defeat him . <p> Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment allegations were unveiled . In late July , the Alliance for Justice , an umbrella group of liberals leading the opposition to Thomas , received a phone call from a Yale Law School classmate of Anita Hill 's who reported hearing that Hill had complained of sexual harassment by Thomas while at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . The group referred the matter to the staff of Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , an Ohio Democrat and key Thomas opponent . <p> By September 3 , Hill had been asked about the rumors but did not disclose her own story . Meantime , the staff of Democrat Edward Kennedy , another Thomas opponent , was doing its own sleuthing . On September 5 , Hill received a call from Labor subcommittee Kennedy staffer Ricki Seidman , who was interviewing former EEOC employees on assorted issues and asked about reports of sexual harassment . Hill said she needed time to decide whether she would respond . <p> Four days later , Seidman called back ; Hill agreed to talk . In an effort to raise the comfort level , Hill was referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke the next day  --  and Hill outlined her charges against Thomas . Brudney , who works for Metzenbaum on the Labor subcommittee , passed the information along to Metzenbaum 's staff on the Judiciary Committee on September 11 . Hill called the next day and spoke with Harriet Grant , the committee 's chief nominations counsel . <p> But there was a problem . Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden had made it clear he hoped questions about Thomas 's character were not to be the focus of his hearings . Some sources say that even maverick Metzenbaum was concerned about crossing Biden on that point . And Kennedy would hardly be the proper senator to raise an issue of sexual harassment  --  either publicly or internally  --  given both his recent and ancient family problems . Still , the conversations with Hill continued  --  often much to her frustration . The point that stymied everything was her absolute insistence that her charges be kept confidential . <p> The next days were full of misunderstandings . Hill thought her September 12 request was simple : She wanted her charges kept secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her own political naivete , sources say , led her to believe the committee could consider her charges and , if they were found credible , use them to prompt Thomas to withdraw quietly . In the hot glare of national attention , Hill told the panel : " I made a great effort to make sure it did not come to this . ' <p> But life in the Senate does not work that way : Grant , one of several congressional-staff women who dealt with Hill , told the professor that the committee 's sense of fair play required that an allegation against a nominee can be circulated to members only if the nominee has a chance to respond . On September 18 , the committee was called by a corroborating witness . Two days later , Hill called  --  expecting members to be informed of her charges  --  and was once again told firmly that the committee 's " hands are tied until we can confront the nominee . ' <p> Enter the FBI . By now , both sides were frustrated . An FBI investigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reject the idea . On Sept. 23 , she changed her mind and agreed to speak with the FBI  --  and to allow Thomas to be informed . Finally , after almost two weeks without any aggressive committee investigation , the process had begun . Hill sent a separate four-page personal statement to the committee . The same day , the White House was told of the charges . <p> Ken Duberstein , the former White House chief of staff retained as the official Thomas handler , wasted little time . He called Danforth , a longtime Thomas friend , to tell him the news  --  and Danforth called Thomas , who point-blank denied the allegations . The FBI report was rushed to completion in two days and amounted to a " she said , he said " back and forth that drew no conclusions about who was telling the truth . One additional witness corroborating Hill 's story was also interviewed . The investigation was finished on September 25 , just two days before the final committee vote . <p> That evening , Biden and ranking committee Republican Strom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Minority Leader Bob Dole . They decided to keep the matter quiet  --  to protect Hill 's identity at her request . Biden spent the rest of the day and the entire next day informing his committee Democrats . Not a single member pushed for postponement or a closed-door session with Hill . <p> Once the story broke , Biden and his colleagues were skewered for their silence  --  and for the delay in investigating . " Would it not have been wise to call Anita Hill to meet with members of the committee ? ' asks Thomas supporter Republican Nancy Kassebaum , one of two women in the Senate . " As a group , they could have pointed out that if she continued to remain anonymous , her testimony would be invalid . ' <p> Biden was furious at the charges , saying it would have been " immoral " to force Hill to go public when she refused . " How can you have expected us to force Professor Hill , against her will , into the blinding light you see here today ? ' Biden explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to discuss these charges against her will . ' <p> Biden 's greatest concern all along was leaks . When a senator on the committee was shown Hill 's written statement , it was taken back . Members who chose to read the separate FBI report , like Paul Simon of Illinois , scanned it in the presence of a committee staffer and then returned it . Biden told Danforth at one point that he " would n't be surprised " if it all became public . The worry , says Danforth , was that " perhaps she would hold a press conference . ' As it turned out , he was worrying about the wrong leak . <p> The committee 's vote was a cliffhanger  --  7 to 7  --  on September 27 . But while the country was caught up in the public drama , the behind-the-scenes machinations over Anita Hill were just as compelling : When he heard of the allegations , Simon was disturbed enough to call Hill himself . She asked that he distribute copies of her statement about Thomas to all members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " impossible " and tried to persuade her to testify . When he failed , Simon still sought no delay in the committee vote . Fellow Democrat Patrick Leahy did not read the " For Senators Only " envelope containing Hill 's statement until the day of the vote . " We all wanted to know whether there was any way to get this woman to testify , ' he says . " This should have come out in the hearings  --  and there 's no way we can do that over . ' <p> If Republicans seemed more sanguine , it was because many remained uninformed . Thurmond now says " they could have all read the FBI report , ' but some now complain they never knew one existed . Charles Grassley of Iowa says he only learned of the news " while we were sitting there the day of the final vote . ' In passing , a colleague asked , " Did you hear the latest ? " Grassley had not . Thurmond did tell Hatch and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania . Hatch called Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why she would make a comment like that . ' Specter called Danforth and then asked Thomas about the allegations in his office the day of the vote . But Republican Hank Brown of Colorado was told by GOP staff there was " nothing significant " in the charges . When he later read the FBI report after the news became public , he considered it significant enough to call Hill herself . The language in the report , she told him , was not as explicit as the actual comments . At the hearing , Hill filled in the missing details . <p> Hours before the full Senate was scheduled to vote on Thomas , there was still no clear inclination to delay the vote . It took a national uproar and unusual pressure in the Capitol to change the dynamic . Women from the House marched across the Capitol to demand a hearing from their male Senate colleagues . Congressional switchboards were jammed . In a private Republican caucus , Kassebaum told her male colleagues that " it is important for Clarence Thomas to take the initiative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so because his handlers were still being assured by some Democrats that things were not yet out of control . But the Democratic leaders misjudged their own flock , and the public . Finally , the numbers dictated the outcome : Enough Democrats were defecting to insure a loss for Thomas . And so plans were made for a full airing of Hill 's charges before the Judiciary Committee and a Senate vote on the nomination this week . <p> In fact , the 10-year-old case Hill presented was hardly ideal , raising serious questions of credibility . Why did Hill , a lawyer dedicated to rooting out harassment who worked in the very agency charged with defending women 's rights , never file a complaint against Thomas ? Why , if she felt harassed , had she switched jobs to continue to work with him when he moved from the Education Department to the EEOC in 1982 ? She explained she was young , and vulnerable , and worried about raising a charge that could cost her her job . " I 'm embarrassed I did n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment had stopped for a while , leading her to believe that following him to the EEOC would be all right . She did not dispute phone logs showing that she kept in touch with Thomas in the years since she left Washington , but the contention of Thomas defenders that they were evidence of a cordial relationship , she said , was " garbage . " Still , Hill said when all was done that she would not have aired the charge at all had she not been approached by committee staffers . <p> At the end of the most extraordinary television showdown , it was Clarence Thomas 's ringing condemnation of the process that struck the most powerful note . This was the real nominee speaking . " From the very beginning , charges were leveled against me from the shadows , charges of drug abuse , antisemitism , wife beating , drug use by family members , ' he said . " This is not American , this is Kafkaesque . It has got to stop . It must stop for the benefit of future nominees and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , Danforth went to visit Thomas at home . He offered comfort , telling his friend he was sorry . " And it was n't an expression of pity . I meant I 'm sorry for what I 've done . ' Never again , says Danforth , would he advise anybody to take a job that requires confirmation by the United States Senate . As Thomas himself told his judges , " No job is worth what I have been through . ' If Thomas withdraws his name altogether  --  or the Senate ultimately votes him down  --  the court vacancy still will need filling . But by whom ? Danforth 's prediction : " All of our nominees are going to be people who come from the mountains of New Hampshire  --  or suckers .
