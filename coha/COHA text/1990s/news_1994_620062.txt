<p> THE SIMPLE TRUTH  --  WHY WE ARE IN HAITI <p> Editor  --  What 's wrong with our common sense ? Has everyone got blinders on ? We are not going to Haiti to be at war . We are going for one simple and basic reason . To eliminate a group of thugs masquerading as police and military . <p> Would you expect us to do any different with a group of people like this in our country ? <p> Get with it , people . Wake up . This is one world and what affects one group of people affects us all , whether or not you understand this simple fact yet . <p> Do you support the kind of victimizing and terrorizing of Haitians that is going on ? Obviously the 70 percent who are against the impending action do , or have not thought through the current situation in Haiti correctly . <p> Get it straight . As a stronger country , we are going to help out some neighbors who are being victimized and terrorized by some of the worst kind of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the rights of their countrymen , but only about their warped agenda . Do n't give any kind of support to these kinds of people . By our inaction we do . <p> There is a major redeeming benefit that will be gained from this operation . Similar groups of outlaws , thugs and violators around the world are going to take notice of exactly what they can expect if they continue their inhumane and criminal activities against their countrymen . <p> Is this event any clearer to you yet ? How can so many people not see this simple truth ? <p> RON LOWE <p> Nevada City ( Nevada County ) <p> LET CUBA OCCUPY HAITI <p> Editor  --  If Haiti must be occupied to reinstall Aristide , a duly elected Communist thug , why do n't we let Cuba do it ? For years we have embargoed Cuba for their efforts to export communism throughout Central and South America , and now we do their job for them with American soldiers and American money ! <p> Cuba has a ruthless , efficient military well suited for an occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to his tyrannical rule . If Haitians want communism , let the Cubans give it to them good and proper . Bring American soldiers home . We African Americans deserve better . <p> RICHARD B. BODDIE <p> Huntington Beach ( Orange County ) <p> ' WORDS OF WISDOM ' <p> Editor  --  Once again , one is reminded of the words of wisdom and near despair spoken by the Great Liberator , Simon Bolivar , many years ago : " The United States seems destined by Providence to constantly plague the rest of America with miseries in the name of Freedom . " Will it never end ? <p> JOSEPH J. O'DONOHUE IV <p> San Francisco <p> THE CAIRO CONFERENCE <p> Editor  --  Thank you , Richard Rodriguez , for your refreshing defense of the role of the Vatican in the recent Cairo conference on population control ( Other Views , September 14 ) . The conference was not only racist and imperialist , as you pointed out , but also anti-women ! American papers kept touting the " empowerment of women , " ignoring the fact that the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese policy of mandatory birth control/ abortion . Do the Catholics for Choice really want to be associated with the government that forces IUDs on young women  --  taking the strings out and inviting infec tion so they ca n't be removed except via a painful procedure ? Does n't choice mean that we can choose the size of our families ? Tell that to the aborted babies in China , or the victims of female infanticide in India . <p> Although I am a conservative Catholic , neither I nor most of my acquaintances would presume to consider you " moral scum , " Mr. Rodriguez . You are a child of God , and as such , worthy of great love . You are also , like most of us , a sinner . I will pray for you , if you will pray for me . Bargain ? <p> JEAN E. GRAHAM <p> San Mateo <p> BURGEONING UNDERCLASS <p> Editor  --  Too bad Molly Ivins was n't one of President Clinton 's advisers on the crime bill ; her column , " A Crime Factory for Sociopaths " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ass-backward our approach to crime is . <p> We are paying the price of having created a permanent underclass in our society , an underclass which is growing and is not all non- white . Until we address that fact realistically and courageously , building more prisons and adding more police will prove as ineffectual as trying to hold back a flood by putting one 's finger in the dike . <p> ALTA C. GOLDNER <p> Albany <p> BE AN AMERICAN <p> Editor  --  The article anent American blacks still undecided about being called " African American " ( Chronicle , September 17 ) greatly interested me . My first thought was : " What is wrong with being called an American ? " Anyone who cares can readily see they are black , but that does not necessarily mean they came from Africa . I am also reminded that if professional golfer Gary Player decided to become an American citizen , he , too , would be an African American . He is white ! That fact alone underscores the unimportance of the subject . My brother American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture . . . what is wrong with being an American ? <p> WILLIAM HELLER <p> Half Moon Bay <p> POT 'S MEDICAL UTILITY <p> Editor  --  Re " Pot Is Not Medicine " ( Chronicle , September 11 ) : <p> Lovinger and Jones spout the usual drug-war rhetoric . They ignore the fact that insulin , penicillin and aspirin , to name a few , came into widespread use through " anecdotal " evidence . Minoxidil 's use to stimulate hair growth is a recent example of a medicine being approved for a use through anecdotal evidence . Now , we have thousands of oncologists recommending marijuana as an anti-emetic and appetite stimulant . Do Lovinger and Jones expect us to believe that these highly trained doctors are incapable of objectively evaluating marijuana 's medical utility ? And what about the patients ? Are we expected to believe that they are imagining the relief they get from chemo-induced nausea ? I think not . <p> There is , however , plenty of reason to doubt self-serving pot warriors such as Lovinger and Jones who make their living writing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may just be a living , but for the rest of us , marijuana is vital for our health and the welfare of our environment . <p> LEONARD MUNCH <p> San Francisco <p> GET THEM OFF THE ROAD <p> Editor  --  This letter responds to Mr. Gieringer 's letter of September 7 . Mr. Gieringer seems to have forgotten that possession of marijuana and underage drinking are illegal . I see no problem with " Smoke a Joint , Lose Your Car . " I believe that it equates to " Break a Law , Face the Consequences . " The point of the new law to confiscate cars from drivers with suspended licenses is to get the people that feel they are above the law off the streets . Too many people are high and mighty and feel that the laws do not apply to them . You do not need to be a genius to understand it ; simply put , if you do n't have a license , do n't drive your car . If you got caught with a joint and your license was suspended , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what a suspended license means . Those of us driving on a valid license with fully paid insurance are sick and tired of paying for the prima donnas that do n't feel they need licenses or insurance . <p> PHILIP PARKER <p> Bay Point ( Contra Costa County ) <p> OPERA , OPERA , EVERYWHERE <p> Editor  --  The opera season has begun . There were , of course , brown bag and Old St. Mary 's . At least at the church nobody talked during the performance . The brown bag opera had its share of little old ladies who decided to talk through the music and singing . Opera in the Park was a real challenge . It seemed that each section of grassy plain was the place for a lively social club , with no real regard for the incredible music . The singers were in exceptional form , and fortunately the event was being recorded for later playback , where the real excellence was displayed . It should be a great season . <p> DONALD BEGGS <p> San Francisco <p> MORE ON ESQ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are lawyers , although , of course , I would n't want my daughter to marry one . Still , I think we should be fair . <p> It is accepted practice in our society for those of learning to identify themselves with a title . " Doctors , " both medical and scholastic , abound . Those who have mastered the study of law are equally entitled to the privilege of identifying themselves . " Esquire , " from the Latin scutum , meaning shield , is appropriate because a lawyer is the protector of the individual citizen who may find himself , sometimes unjustly , charged with violations of the law or government regulations . <p> E.M .
