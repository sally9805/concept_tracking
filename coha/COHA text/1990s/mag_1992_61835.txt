The time you won your town the race We chaired you through the market-place ; Man and boy stood cheering by , And home we brought you shoulder-high . Today , the road all runners come , Shoulder-high we bring you home , And set you at your threshold down , Townsman of a stiller town .  --  A.E . HOUSMAN To an Athlete Dying Young // It would be hard to find two guys who seemed less ready to die than Jerome Brown and Eric Andolsek . Young and huge and fit , they each could bench-press more than 400 pounds , run like deer and fight off the strongest of men , often two at a time . Death ? These guys rippled with life . Andolsek , 6 ' 2 " and 286 pounds , was an avid outdoorsman , and he was so massive across the chest that his nickname was Table . Brown , 6 ' 2 " and 300 pounds , once single-handedly broke up a KKK meeting , and once saved an entire family from a burning house . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which snuffed out both of them last week . // Brown , a two-time Pro Bowl player and the main beam of the Philadelphia Eagles ' superb defensive line , was driving his 1991 forest-green Corvette in his hometown of Brooksville , Fla. , on Thursday , June 25 , when he lost control of the car and smashed into a power pole , killing himself and his 12-year-old nephew . Brown was 27 . Two days before , Andolsek , a rising star at left guard for the Detroit Lions , was cutting weeds in his front yard in Thibodaux , La. , when a flatbed truck veered off the road and ran him over . He was 25 . Their deaths follow by six weeks the fatal shooting of Shane Curry , an Indianapolis Colt defensive end , who was killed in the wee hours outside a Cincinnati nightclub during an argument over a blocked parking space . Curry was 24 . Heaven is now full up with linemen. // Though their deaths have linked them forever , Brown and Andolsek could n't have lived more antithetically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funny and passionate and generous . He played football in great chunks of energy , rollicking and wiggling here , stomping and swaggering there , heaving his helmet now and again for good measure . He was the Eagles ' class clown and their conscience and their inspiration . And to hundreds of needy kids , he was like a big lovable brother . In January 1991 he rented two buses to take 70 kids from Brooksville to a pre-Super Bowl football clinic in Tampa . // The ninth of 10 children of a truck mechanic and his wife , Brown could be both remarkably immature and brave . As a teenager he fathered two children by different women . At the 1987 Fiesta Bowl banquet honoring the players from his Miami team and those from opposing Penn State , he ripped off his shirt to reveal army fatigues underneath it , announced , " The Japanese never sat down with the Americans before Pearl Harbor , " and got up and left , taking all his teammates with him . In ' 88 he broke up a KKK rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stereo just past brain-jiggling level and holding up a sign that read GO AWAY KKK . Because none of the folks at the rally could hear themselves anymore , much less the Klansmen who were speaking , the KKK had no choice but to pack up and go home . // Brown was the number one horn behind Miami 's swaggering brassiness of the mid-1980s . It was while he was with the Hurricanes that he began collecting dangerous toys , like exotic guns and fast cars . He owned a .44 Magnum and an Uzi , and was banned from campus housing after a child found his Luger hidden under a dorm stairwell . // He had a weakness for Corvettes , one of which he totaled on a Florida highway in his junior year at Miami . He walked away from that accident unscratched , but he apparently did not take the hint  --  maybe because he had a need for speed . Brown once recalled that the first time he drove a car was with his father on a highway . The traffic was doing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yelling , " Hit the gas ! Hit the gas ! Boy , you do n't hit the gas , and I ai n't gon na let you drive no more ! " Said Brown , " I hit it and ai n't slowed down since . " Until that Thursday . // That Thursday 12-year-old Augusta Wesley Brown was with his Uncle Jerome when Jerome went to Register Chevrolet to check on a 1973 Chevy the dealership was restoring for him . The police think that as Jerome peeled away from the dealership , he was going far too fast on the rain-slicked road and skidded . Trying to right the car , he may have overcompensated . He hit a dirt mound that sent the car flying . It nicked a palm tree , flipped and slammed into the power pole . The bodies were taken directly to the morgue . // " He lived fast , and he drove fast , " says Mike Golic , an Eagle noseguard . " For a while he seemed to live on the edge , but I thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy Ryan , who picked Brown in the first round of the 1987 draft , " It 's going to leave a big void in the locker room . He 's the guy that kick-started them , the guy that led the defense , regardless of what everyone else thinks . He was a great , great player . " // Unlike Brown , Andolsek , whose death was the third torturous twist of fate in seven months for the Lions ( box , page 38 ) , was a quiet man . A fifth-round draft choice out of LSU in 1988 and a starter for Detroit since ' 89 , he was a serious player with a will that ran deep . Many in the NFL believe that Andolsek was on the verge of a Pro Bowl season . " He played with everything , " says Lion linebacker Chris Spielman , who once got into a shoving match with Andolsek at the coin toss before an LSU-Ohio State game but became his best friend and roommate in the pros . " His heart , his soul , everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard off Louisiana State Highway 1 when James Bennett , 34 , of Baton Rouge came driving down the road . Police think Bennett became distracted at the wheel of his 10-wheel diesel , which was going about 50 mph . Bennett veered off the perfectly straight section of the two-lane blacktop and came toward Andolsek . But Andolsek , with his back to the road and the whirring of the weed cutter in his ears , probably did n't hear the runaway truck until it was too late . The truck ran over Andolsek and continued on another 400 yards before stopping . Bennett was charged with negligent homicide and failure to maintain control of his vehicle . // Andolsek 's funeral brought more than 500 people , including some members of the Lions , to a small Catholic church in Thibodaux . Another hundred or so mourners crowded onto the front steps . " The ultimate warrior has been laid to rest , " said LSU assistant coach Jerry Sullivan after the funeral . // " It does n't seem fair , " says Eagle center David Alexander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys were in peak physical shape . Now they 're gone . One minute they 're All-Pros . The next minute they 're not even alive . " // Coincidently , both Brown and Andolsek had been through the sudden deaths of teammates . Brown was friends with Curry , who played at Miami from 1987 through ' 91 . Andolsek had played at LSU with Ralph Norwood , who died as an Atlanta Falcon rookie three years ago after apparently falling asleep and crashing his car on a suburban Atlanta road . // Yes , they say only the good die young , but that does n't make it easier to stomach . In Thibodaux and Detroit , in Brooksville and Philadelphia , a lot of dinners are going uneaten , a lot of hearts are sagging . There was once a little girl who came to her grandfather 's funeral , saw him lying in his casket , stomped her foot and said , " I was n't through with him yet . " // A lot of people were n't through with Jerome Brown and Eric Andolsek.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
