Section : SPECIAL REPORT CRISIS IN THE GULF <p> In a new era of U.S.-Soviet relations , the summit in Helsinki shows that Bush and Gorbachev agree far more than they disagree over the crisis in the Persian Gulf <p> If the Persian Gulf crisis had erupted a few years ago , Washington and Moscow might have found themselves on a collision course . The showdown between Iraq , a key Soviet client , and Saudi Arabia , a vital friend of the United States , could have embroiled the superpowers in the kind of regional upheaval that can escalate into a wider conflict . Now that the cold war has eased , George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev find relatively little in the gulf situation to disagree about . Their impromptu mini-summit in Helsinki at the weekend was not called to thrash out significant differences . The purpose was mainly symbolic  --  to send a message to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein . After seven hours of talks , Bush and Gorbachev said they were " united in the belief that Iraq 's aggression must not be tolerated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , the two leaders have maintained close contact in an extraordinary dialogue that has changed the nature of U.S.-Soviet relations ( page 24 ) . Moscow insists that the gulf crisis can be settled peacefully ; the summit produced no indication that Gorbachev would support a military move against Saddam . But Soviet sources say he is so eager to accommodate Bush that he is unlikely to actively oppose an American use of force against Iraq , if it comes to that . " Gorbachev will go along , implicitly if not explicitly , " says a top Kremlin foreign-policy adviser . " There is too much at stake in U.S.-Soviet relations for Gorbachev to risk opposing Bush on this . " Gorbachev wants American economic help , and by the end of this year , he hopes to wrap up arms-control agreements on long-range nuclear weapons and conventional forces in Europe . <p> Extra cost : Even as they take the lead in countering Iraqi aggression , the superpowers are struggling economically . Gorbachev 's reforms are going so badly that there is now an ominous shortage of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of Operation Desert Shield soars past $1 billion a month , deficit-ridden America can no longer afford to police the world . Bush sent Secretary of State James Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to pass the hat among well-heeled allies last week ( page 30 ) . Baker may have covered almost the entire extra cost of the gulf operation by extracting lavish pledges from the Arab rulers most directly in the line of fire : Saudi Arabia 's King Fahd and the exiled Emir of Kuwait . But other allies , notably the Japanese , did not come through as generously as Washington had hoped . <p> Meanwhile the number of American military men and women deployed in the gulf region passed the 100,000 mark . Iraq seemed to flinch in the face of the buildup , allowing more hostage women and children to go home . When Iraqi troops in Kuwait shot and slightly wounded a fleeing American man , Baghdad quickly sent out a spokesman to insist that the shooting was an " accident . " Saddam issued another of his calls for a holy war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime carefully avoided any military moves that might give the Americans an excuse to attack . <p> Bush 's Arab allies believe that force will eventually be needed to drive Saddam out of Kuwait and end for good his threat to the region . Asked how long the allies should stick to the search for a peaceful solution , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said : " It may last only one month , maybe two months , but I 'm telling you that it is n't going to last for one year . " For now , however , the Bush administration is trying to resolve the crisis in the way the American people say they prefer : without war . That could require a U.S. military presence in the region for years to come . <p> " Our efforts are going to take time , and that is what we ask most of the American people , " Baker told Congress last week . " Stand firm . Be patient . And remain united . " <p> The Soviets are n't convinced that Bush himself has that kind of patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to start a war , with all the risks that entails , or whether they are willing to wait , to see if the economic blockade works or helps to produce a coup against Saddam Hussein , " says a well-informed Soviet official . Still gun shy after Afghanistan , Moscow is unlikely to sign up for any joint U.S.Soviet military action . The Americans are n't eager for such assistance . Although Bush has called for a Soviet military presence in the gulf , he prefers the freedom of operating alone , White House sources say . <p> As long as the sitzkrieg lasts , there are few tactical of contention between Washington and Moscow . The Americans are unhappy the continued presence of 193 Soviet military specialists in Iraq . The Soviets say those advisers had nothing to do with the invasion of Kuwait , and they argue that continued contact with the Iraqi military may produce intelligence information that is otherwise unavailable to the Americans . The superpowers also differ over how to pursue a negotiated settlement . Last week Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze repeated Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East ; he said it deal with the " interlocking problems " of the gulf crisis , the Arab-Israeli conflict and the chaos in Lebanon . Actually , the three problems hardly interlock at all , but Moscow is n't pushing hard for a conference , and Washington recognizes that proposing it is a necessary gesture for the Soviets . " They have to have some credibility with the rest of their Arab clientele , " says a U.S. official . <p> Still , Washington and Moscow are divided by what one Soviet official describes as " a fundamental divergence of interests " in the Middle East . Moscow 's position there would be enhanced if it brokered a compromise . But Washington opposes any face-saving concessions to Saddam , and by accepting money from Kuwait 's emir , it seems to have given up the option of writing him off in negotiations . The Soviets have a vested economic and political interest in Saddam 's regime , which owes them billions of dollars for arms purchases . They want a solution that will save Iraq enough face to ensure Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow . The Kremlin has wider interests in the region that preclude too close a tie to Washington . " We are trying to reassure our traditional Arab friends that the Soviet Union is not tilting toward Israel , " says a Soviet official . <p> That 's why Baker 's call last week for " a new regional security structure " in the Middle East was unlikely to succeed . In fact , Baker overstated his case , seeming to suggest a NATO-style alliance , with Moscow as a possible partner ( page 27 ) . What hereally had in mind was n't yet fleshed out , aides said , but it involved a core alliance among the Arab nations of the gull supported by U.S. air and naval power and by Soviet influence exercised initially through the United Nations . Arab officials prefer to work together through existing institutions , such as the Gulf Cooperation Council . And with a wary eye on Arab nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists in their own countries , many Arab leaders prefer to keep the American military presence unofficial , rather than making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Bush and Gorbachev may be able to cooperate in more mundane ways . The Soviet Union is the world 's largest oil producer , and Kremlin officials think their oil could help make up for the loss of crude from Iraq and Kuwait  --  if the United States provides the technology and investment needed to boost sagging Soviet production . On his way to Helsinki , Bush said he would like to see " the best in American know-how on oil production , drilling and seismic work going to the Soviet Union . " <p> Moscow can reciprocate by helping to maintain the trade embargo . " The Iraqis are scampering all over the world to buy things , " says a senior U.S. official . Vietnam has beenasked for rice , Libya for weapons and Eastern European companies for an array of goods . So far the embargo is holding well , at least at sea ; last week the U. S. Navy seized its first Iraqi freighter . But air lanes to Baghdad are still open , and several countries , including China , India and Iran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq under a provision of the U.N . sanctions that permits such shipments for " humanitarian " purposes . U.S. officials , who oppose early use of the loophole , think the would-be suppliers are merely positioning themselves to get in on a lucrative trade once the United Nations permits it . Bush believes that Gorbachev 's support is vital to making the embargo stick for as long as possible . <p> Whether or not the standoff leads to war , the Bush administration is hunkering down for a long haul in the Persian Gulf . So far , public support is strong , but if the crisis starts to cost American lives , or hammers the U.S. economy , Bush may find himself in political trouble . " The longer the troops are there , the less we can count on Americans holding the line on our commitment , " says Republican pollster Nell Newhouse . And the longer the crisis drags on , the more George Bush will need support from Mikhail Gorbachev . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Members of the Iraqi militia practice their marching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The presidents meet on Sunday , a U.S. M1 tank stands guard in Saudi Arabia <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An F/A-18 Hornet on the deck of the carrier Independence in the gulf <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Former hostages finally reach freedom at Orly Airport in Paris <p> By RUSSELL WATSON with MARGARET GARRARD WARNER , FRED COLEMAN and ANN McDANIEL in Helsinki and THOMAS M.
