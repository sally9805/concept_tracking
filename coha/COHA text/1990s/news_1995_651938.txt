<p> On the night of Jan. 31 , 1968 , a young Vietnamese peasant named Nguyen Van Sau sat with about 20 companions in a garage not far from the center of Saigon . It was the first night after Tet , the lunar new year , and although Communist attacks the night before had caused the official annual Tet cease-fire to be canceled , the city was full of visitors celebrating the holiday . Like the rest , Sau and his friends had come to town by bus or on foot , carrying holiday packages . But Nguyen Van Sau and the others were not in Saigon to celebrate . They were members of Sapper Battalion C-10 of the Vietcong and their packages were weapons . <p> Sau had grown up illiterate in Cu Chi Province , just outside the capital . In the National Liberation Front , he had learned to read and write , and had been instructed in the front 's version of exalted patriotism . As a special honor , he was invited to join the Communist Party . And now he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sapper Battalion C-10 were going to attack the United States Embassy . <p> At around 2:45 A.M. , their little convoy set out . It consisted of two vehicles : an old Peugeot van and a taxi of the same make , both familiar vehicles on Saigon streets . The embassy was a fortress , nearly new , a $2.5 million complex that fairly dominated downtown Saigon . Its key buildings featured shatterproof plexiglass , and the entire compound was surrounded by an eight-foot wall . <p> Shortly before 3 A.M. , the guerrillas in the taxi opened fire on the military police post at the main entrance . The M.P . ' s returned fire and slammed shut and padlocked the steel gate . The Vietcong in the van , which stopped around the corner , used an antitank explosive to breach the wall . In seconds a commando squad of about two dozen was pouring through it . The two M.P . ' s turned to face them . The first American to die was Specialist 4 Charles L. Daniel of Durham , N.C. He and his partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions , and their refusal to yield or withdraw probably spoiled the attack . <p> U.S. reinforcements were soon brought to bear , and the battle for the embassy grounds went on through the night . By around 9 A.M. , all of the attackers had been killed or captured . The American dead consisted of the two M.P . ' s and one marine . The Communists had failed to gain entrance to a single building . <p> Up until that point in the war , nearly 20,000 Americans had died along with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese . More than 58,000 Americans and an estimated four million Vietnamese  --  soldiers and civilians  --  would die before it was over . <p> During the early hours of Jan. 31 , 1968 , there was fierce fighting in Saigon and all over Vietnam . But the attack on the embassy , in its quixotic effrontery , was perhaps the engagement that most fascinated the world . <p> In January , I spent a few days in Saigon , which is now called Ho Chi Minh City , just as Sixth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas . It was coming up on Tet and everyone was buying presents ; people were carrying little potted tangerine trees and apricot flowers , and visitors from up north were carrying peach boughs and blossoms , which do n't grow in the southern part of the country . <p> The town was booming as never before . Foreign businessmen , including plenty of Americans , were everywhere . On the roof of the Rex , the hotel that once was the American bachelor officers ' quarters , tourists and local plutocrats were dining on frogs ' legs . The old gourmet restaurants are gone , but new ones seem to be opening every day . <p> On what was the Rue Catinat before it was Tu Do Street , before it was Dong Khoi Street , antique porcelain and jewelry are for sale to prosperous buyers . Visitors can buy silk dresses , made to measure by shops whose employees will gladly stitch through the night to have the garments ready first thing in the morning . <p> Diners at the Rex can watch the streets below illuminated by Toshiba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few old billboards enjoin Marxist morality  --  one condemns bootlegging  --  but the touts and the girls and the transvestites are all back in the same old places . <p> What would it be like to take a walk around town with Specialist Daniel , Private Sebast and Nguyen Van Sau and his comrades of C-10 one of these lovely holiday evenings , 27 years after the attack that killed them ? Would they guess who had won the war in which they died ? Surely the Americans would have thought it was their side . And Sau might be amazed at the fruits of the Communists ' victory . <p> Vietnamese Communism was not going to threaten Durham , N.C. , as the men who recruited young Daniel doubtless assured him it was . It was not even going to trouble Saigon all that long . <p> Nor was the earth about to rise on new foundations for Sau , although he might take some comfort in the new name for the G.I.s ' old haunt , Tu Do Street . <p> Dong Khoi , formerly Tu Do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , means Spontaneous Uprising  --  presumably the one Sau and his friends waited all night in vain for in 1968 . Although the uprising never came , they changed the street name anyhow . That 's how politicians are . <p> Today , many a deal is in the making . In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City , new factories will soon make Wisk liquid soap and Sunlight detergent for the Vietnamese kitchen . And before long , there will be a new U.S. embassy in Hanoi . <p> How ironic it all is . Perhaps such a squandering of young lives ought to be consigned to the realm of private grief , reflecting more shame than glory on the causes served . Yet we find ourselves moved and inspired by the heroism of young people who do their duty , who serve with all the vigor of their youth , strength and courage . The political futility of their sacrifice gives it a poignancy that is somehow ennobling . Even the Hemingway of " A Farewell to Arms , " professing revulsion at the rhetoric of heroism , movingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a period of denial and ambiguity , the United States began erecting fitting monuments to the Americans who died in our futile war . Somehow we ca n't keep ourselves from honoring those who give their lives in the wars to which our shortsightedness and folly consign them . Yet we know that in every war lives are lost , meaninglessly , and that the cause behind their sacrifice is soon rendered irrelevant . <p> We have never succeeded in replacing proper conduct on the field of battle as the ultimate measure of courage and loyalty . We have not developed that " moral equivalent of war " that William James so wisely and impossibly called for . Knowing not a whit more than the ancient Greeks , we console ourselves as they did in catharsis , in stoic acceptance and tragic ritual . Our celebration of death in battle is , from a certain perspective , utterly irrational . Yet it is our only means of imposing some degree of meaning on war 's meaningless destruction , the only way we have of facing the eternal ironies @ @ @
