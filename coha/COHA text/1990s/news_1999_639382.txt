<p> In the eyes of America 's baseball fans - at least those with a mouse pad and enough money to pay the phone bill - Nolan Ryan was the best pitcher of the 20th century and Christy Mathewson was No. 14 , just ahead of Kent Bottenfield and right behind Mike Maddux . Seems kind of silly , does n't it ? Even when you consider that we made up the part about Bottenfield and Maddux . <p> It 's silly , all right . But then , it 's just a list . A lot of lists are silly . It 's not like this one took any digging , any research , any empty canisters of midnight oil . All you had to do was click on to majorleaguebaseball.com and move your mouse , not to be confused with shaking your booty . A few million clicks later and , voila ! , Major League Baseball had its Team of the Century . And to think , we used to use typewriters . <p> Chip Atkison is the former president of the Rocky Mountain chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thinks some of the Team of the Century rankings are , well , rank . Of course , he does n't like lists in general , much less one that would leave Mathewson out of its all-Century bullpen , much less its starting rotation . <p> ' Lists are so limiting , ' Atkison said . ' Lists are fine , but what 's behind the list ? Who researched the list ? Why should someone be on the list ? I like to know a little more than what 's on a list . What 's the real story ? ' <p> So that 's it . They do n't like lists . That explains why , when SABR offered its 6,600-plus members a chance to vote on the top 100 players of the century , only 866 responded . It seems , for the rank-and-file SABR member , the fun was n't in the voting , but the grumbling about how everyone else voted . <p> ' A lot of our members are contrarians , ' said John Zajc , SABR 's manager of membership services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pick them apart . ' <p> Unless , of course , they 're too busy poring over 70-year-old box scores in search of statistical discrepancies . Or indexing every poem ever written about baseball . Or tracking down the answer to the question you 've been pondering since you woke up this morning : What pitcher gave up the most doubles in one inning ? <p> The answer is Lefty Grove , with six . But then , you knew that . Assuming , of course , that your SABR annual dues are up to date . <p> Surgeon general 's warning : SABR is n't for garden-variety baseball fans who take in two or three games a season . It 's for people who eat , drink , breathe and , yes , play baseball , if only in over-40 beer leagues . SABR members generally are analytical types who seek solace from today 's game , which many view as cheapened by lively balls , incredibly shrinking ballparks and expansion pitching , by wrapping themselves in baseball 's storied past . <p> ' I think that 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member occasionally writes in to say he 's not renewing , he 'll say : ' I just ca n't get into baseball anymore . I ca n't stand today 's game . There 's just no interest . ' That 's when I scream at no one in particular : ' But SABR is n't about today 's game . It 's about baseball . It could be about baseball in 1999 or 1899 . " <p> It 's about baseball , all right . But mostly , it 's about a deep , passionate , to-the-bones love for baseball . The kind of love you could never know unless you grew up with the game . Most SABR members grew up watching Memorial Day double-headers from bleacher seats that cost six bits . If they were n't in the ballpark , they were listening to the game on their dad 's old Motorola . <p> SABR was born in 1971 when The Sporting News decided to abandon its baseball-bible roots , prompting a group of ' ball junkies to band together and swap research articles . The Cleveland-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris Eckhouse , and more volunteers than any able-bodied statistician could count . <p> Your typical SABR member is male , 40 to 60 years old , with an insatiable appetite for the way things were and a ready opinion on the way they ought to be . Oh , and another thing . SABR members are n't good at taking no for an answer . They 'll ascertain the facts for themselves , thank you very much . That explains how they 've been able to unearth discrepancies in some of the game 's long-standing statistics . <p> Take Hack Wilson 's RBI record . It took a group of SABR members to do what American and National League hitters have whaled at and failed at for almost 70 years : challenge the record . Wilson 's mark of 190 has stood since 1930 , but the record should be 191 according to SABR 's baseball records committee , which 20 years ago discovered a long , lost ribbie in the box scores and game accounts . <p> The committee , one of 18 within the organization , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets from the 1961 season , it discovered that Roger Maris was double-credited with a run batted in , which should have given Jim Gentile a share of the American League RBI crown with 141 . The records committee also has determined , among other things , that Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Cap Anson were erroneously credited with several hits . <p> As undeniable as the evidence is , the baseball establishment steadfastly refuses to change the records . Oh , it acknowledges SABR 's legitimacy , to the point of listing the organization in the game 's official media information directory . But Bud Selig and his cronies are n't about to change some of the game 's most famous benchmarks . <p> ' People have grown up with those numbers , ' Zajc said . ' A lot of those numbers are sacred . They do n't want to see them changed . ' <p> So why bother expending all the time and energy to research their accuracy ? Because , for all the fun they have doing what they do , SABR members - at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view this as a hobby . They see themselves as the custodians of the game , the keepers of the combination to baseball 's historical vault . Plus , it 's in their blood . They need to get it right , whether it 's in their occupations or their preoccupation . <p> ' SABR is pretty much an organization that tries to keep everything straight and on an even keel , ' said Atkison , who at 47 just completed his rookie season in a local 40-and-over league . ' There are a lot of myths surrounding the game . We want the facts . ' <p> SABR knows no bounds when it comes to researching the game 's past . Its 18 committees study such topics as women in baseball , baseball music and poetry , scouts , the Negro leagues , and umpires and rules . <p> The last of those is Atkison 's main area of interest . As a card-carrying member of that committee , he can serve up an alphabet soup of 19th-century factoids , including : a ) Abner Doubleday did n't invent baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Abe Lincoln followed baseball in its early days ; c ) A British cricket writer , Henry Chadwick , developed the box score , and d ) Balls and strikes were established in the 1860s after hitters routinely waited until teammates stole second and third base before swinging at a pitch . <p> How intense is SABR 's focus on the game 's history ? Consider this : The organization did n't just compile a list of the 100 greatest major leaguers of the 20th century . It also ranked the best players of the 19th century , along with the top Negro leaguers , the top 50 contributors to the game , and the top 15 umpires of all time , none of whom recently had their resignations accepted . <p> No matter how esoteric your interests are , SABR has you covered . Among the publications its membership has produced are ' The History of Major League Tie Games , ' ' The Evolution of the Pitcher 's Mound , ' ' Curt Flood : Man Against the System , ' and ' Banana Bat and Ding-Dong Balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , not every SABR member 's mind is that inquiring . Three-quarters of the members pay their $ 50 annual dues so they can receive the organization 's periodicals and attend SABR 's various functions , including the annual national convention , which could land in Denver in 2003 . It 's there , at the meetings , where SABR members do what they do best : talk ' ball . <p> ' You get to meet people plugged into it the same way you are , ' said Paul Parker , Atkison 's successor as president of SABR 's Rocky Mountain chapter . ' They have the same knowledge of baseball as you do . That creates a comfort level that you do n't have around other people . You can refer to the Gashouse Gang and not have to go into a lengthy explanation of what it is . ' <p> The Rocky Mountain chapter 's 116 members come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations . Parker is the Colorado Rockies ' archivist , but he 's hardly the only front-office member in the group . Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Michael Kent , the vice president of finance , and Roger Kinney , the director of community affairs . The chapter includes blue collars , white collars , students , professors , warehouse workers and even a rocket engineer at Lockheed Martin . That would be Barb Sande , one of about 200 women among SABR 's 6,000-plus members . Trust us , she 's as hopelessly hooked as any guy in the group . <p> ' I actually got my husband involved , ' said Sande , who fits into SABR 's average age group , though we 're not about to tell you the exact location . ' If you 're going to be in SABR , the first thing you have to be is a fan of the game . We take it to a whole new level of baseball geekdom . ' <p> Said Atkison , a shipping-and-receiving clerk who moonlights for Stats , Inc. during Rockies games : ' Geek is a great word . I tell everybody I 'm a seamhead . I 'll pull back my hair and show you the seams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a journey to all 26 major league parks in ' 86 , and it was one of the best investments I ever made . ' <p> Maybe the best thing about SABR is that it enables its members to focus on the game , not the peripheral developments that dominate so much of today 's sports sections . As much as they love baseball , SABR members detest salary arbitration and every other aspect of the game 's business side . <p> ' This gives you the stuff you want to read about baseball , ' said Mark Rucker , a 17-year SABR member whose business , Transcendental Graphics in Boulder , supplies age-old images of baseball to various publishing and film entities . ' You can concentrate on the game on the field and ignore all the ( bleep ) off the field . I look at baseball as a continuum that goes back to the 1850s . I like that continuum . ' <p> It 's a grassroots movement , this SABR . How much so ? When the organization increased its annual dues $ 15 earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local chapter often take place at the LoDo microbrewery , where the seventh-inning stretch sometimes entails taste-testing the proprietor 's products . <p> ' We 're all friends , ' Parker said . ' I took over for Chip in a bloodless coup . We had about 14 people in the room one day . When Chip walked in , I said , ' Listen , we 're plotting your overthrow . ' He said : ' Really ? How can I help ? " <p> Parker 's passion for all that is ' ball started during his youth in Brooklyn . He was raised on Bedford Avenue , where , before the wrecking ball came along , they threw legal spitballs in Ebbets Field . <p> ' Our house was 3 miles from the right-field corner , ' he said . ' My mom and dad still live there . Gil Hodges lived on the next block over from us . I was 6 when the Dodgers left , so I never went to one of their games . But as I grew up , I kind of ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not your typical SABR member . Born and raised in Denver , she did n't have a team to call her own until the Rockies arrived . She did n't join SABR until five years ago , and it was n't until this year that she lived out every SABR member 's fantasy . <p> ' We went to the national convention in Phoenix and , while we were there , we saw a no-hitter , ' she said . ' The irony is that Jose Jimenez pitched it against Randy Johnson . Who would have thought he 'd be the one to throw the no-hitter ? ' <p> Sande might be a relative latecomer to the organization , but she 's making up for lost time . Her husband , Steve , has become secretary of the local chapter . Not only that , she 's considering launching a research project on the history of hitting for the cycle . Like we said , she 's hooked . <p> Needless to say , Sande has season tickets to Rockies games . She 's also a regular at Colorado Avalanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As much as she like other sports , she ca n't bring herself to delve into their histories . Not like she does with baseball . <p> ' I do n't know . There 's just something about baseball , ' she said . ' I love hockey and football , but the most I 've done with football is to buy one of those Football for Dummies books . I do n't know what all the lineups mean . I do n't care who played in the past , what stats they had . It 's almost faceless if you look at sports like that . With baseball , the stats are living , breathing things . It 's amazing , but I want to know what players did a long time ago . ' <p> But then , so does every other SABR member . It 's hardly a coincidence that , while Major League Baseball 's All-Century Team listed Ryan as the No. 1 pitcher , he ranked no higher than 14th on SABR 's list , 44th overall . Walter Johnson was SABR 's choice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud owner of 374 major league victories . The highest-ranked active player on SABR 's team ? Roger Clemens at No. 34 , 11th among pitchers . <p> Of all the Rocky Mountain chapter members , Rucker might be the most devoted to the game 's past . In fact , he 's built his business around it . He has images of baseball that date back to the 1820s . When Ken Burns was looking for a picture consultant to work on his famous documentary , ' Baseball , ' he called Rucker . <p> ' Laughter , ' said Rucker , when asked his reaction to Ryan winning the vote for the pitcher of the century . ' What 's his winning percentage , .540 , maybe ? ' <p> Actually , it 's .526 , but close enough . <p> ' The guy who belongs on top of everything is Babe Ruth , ' Rucker said . ' He was a truly incredible pitcher , too . If he had n't gone to the outfield , he might have won 300 games . ' <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all part of being a SABR member . <p> 1 .
