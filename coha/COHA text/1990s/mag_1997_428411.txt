As far as Bernarr Macfadden was concerned , the main aim in life was to be noticed <p> On a gray august afternoon in 1952 , a small plane hovered over the river Seine at the western side of Paris . The plane 's door opened and out stepped a man wearing red flannel long johns , a bright yellow lifejacket and shoes with three-inch foam soles . He pulled the rip cord of his parachute and waved to the crowd below as he drifted down to his landing spot . That was Bernarr Macfadden celebrating his 84th birthday . In case you do n't recognize the name , Macfadden was a physical-fitness guru and publishing genius of the early part of this century , but his main aim in life was to be noticed . <p> What he wanted more than anything else was to become President of the United States . <p> He resembled the heroes of the rags-to-riches novels that were popular at the turn of the century . When he came to New York in 1893 , he was a farm boy from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monumental self-confidence . By 1935 , he had become the head of a giant magazine empire and owner of sanitariums , hotels , health food restaurants and private planes . He was written up in Time and Newsweek , pictured in newsreels and denounced in pulpits . At the sight of a press camera he would strip to his underwear to show off his physique . He ate more carrots in public than Bugs Bunny . He called the medical profession an organized fraud . At a time when sex was rarely mentioned publicly , he wrote and lectured that it was natural , healthy and enjoyable . He said people who followed his rules could live to 120 . He predicted he would make 150 . Some people thought he was a prophet and others a buffoon , but everyone then knew of Bernarr Macfadden . <p> He believed that any publicity was better than being ignored . He walked the streets of Manhattan barefoot to draw magnetic power from the earth . He gave press interviews while standing on his head . He even founded a religion called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become President of the United States , and according to the folklore of the day , his humble origins qualified him as Presidential material . <p> At the age of 84 , a spry Macfadden joins the Bluebell chorus girls in Paris . <p> He was born Bernard Adolphus McFadden on a run-down farm near Mill Spring , Missouri . His father was an alcoholic who died in a fit of delirium tremens . His mother was a consumptive . Unable to care for her sickly son , she sent him to relatives who ran a small , unprofitable hotel in Mount Sterling , Illinois , about 100 miles north of St. Louis . On his arrival , the wife of the proprietor looked Bernard over and said : " He ai n't so much to look at , but there 's likely work in him . " Her husband agreed , vowing : " If there 's work in him , we 'll get it out . " <p> Bernard did hotel chores around the clock , growing even scrawnier on long hours and little food . After about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " Boy , I 've got news for you . Your mother 's dead . " To this the wife added : " And if you ask me , this one 's going the same way soon . Consumption runs in the family . " Seeking to avoid the cost of a funeral , the couple sold Bernard as a bound boy , a sort of apprentice , to a nearby farmer . Farm life was the making of him . He worked hard and ate heartily . The food was better than he 'd known earlier and included whole wheat bread . Within two years , he had gained weight and muscle . <p> He slipped away one night , sneaking rides on trains to St. Louis , where he subsisted on a series of odd jobs , but his health declined . Doctors and patent medicines gave him no relief . As he later wrote in one of the early issues of his first magazine , Physical Culture : " At the age of 16 I was a complete physical wreck . I had the hacking cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I resembled a skeleton ; my digestive organs were in a deplorable condition . " <p> He cured himself and developed large muscles through a vegetarian diet and strenuous daily workouts . This was probably the beginning of his lifelong disdain for the medical community and his feeling of omniscience . He decided what worked for him would work for others , and at the age of 18 he set up in business in St. Louis as a " kinistherapist , " a teacher of what he called " higher physical culture . " <p> Eventually he decided that New York was the place to make his fortune . With a stake of $50 , he rented a two-room apartment at 24 East 20th Street and established himself as an exercise professor . <p> This big move involved another . He changed the spelling and accentuation of his first name , thinking it would sound stronger , like a lion 's roar . He thought Macfadden , without the big F in the middle , was more muscular . The middle name , Adolphus , was easily discarded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses . Macfadden 's began with an exercise machine . In between workout sessions , he invented and patented a muscle developer , a combination of rope , rubber and pulleys . In the promotional pamphlets he wrote for his exerciser , he described how to use the apparatus and included advice on physical fitness and health . Many readers thought the pamphlets were periodicals and asked to subscribe . <p> Macfadden lands exuberantly at the Dansville , New York , airport after making a parachute jump on his 81st birthday . <p> Macfadden rented desk space in a real-estate office and established the Physical Culture Publishing Company . The first issue of Physical Culture came out in March 1899 and sold for five cents . The fledgling publisher wrote the entire magazine under a variety of pen names . He advised readers how to develop themselves physically , how to maintain their health and how to cope with illness . He illustrated it with photographs of himself lightly clad , and muscles bulging . His first editorial was entitled : " Weakness Is a Crime . " The covers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like logos : " WEAKNESS A CRIME " and " DO N'T BE A CRIMINAL . " Physical Culture was a big success . By the end of World War I , circulation had reached 500,000 . <p> Each issue carried articles about sickly men and women who became healthy , strong and beautiful through proper diet and exercise . There were pictures of men in strongman poses and , as times grew more liberal , pictures of lightly clad young women . More than a few of the features bordered on the ludicrous . One contribution of a Spanish writer entitled " Why I Adopted Grass as a Diet " featured a photograph of the tuxedo-clad author gazing hungrily at a lush pasture . All the big ads were for Macfadden exercise products and books ( he eventually wrote 79 ) . The many small ads were for such merchandise as goiter remedies , trusses , cut-rate shoes , sex-advice manuals and electrical healing devices . <p> Macfadden was , it turned out , a man very much ahead of his time . He was for vigorous exercise , fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and fruit , and whole wheat bread . He was against tobacco , alcohol , coffee and tea , corsets , prudery , overeating and white bread , which he called the " staff of death . " <p> Throughout his life , Macfadden was his own best example of his teachings . He worked out regularly and had an exercise for every muscle , including his eyelids . When he was in his 60s , his features were so pronounced that his head looked like a textbook illustration of facial muscles . He even exercised his hair , pulling at it periodically throughout the day . He had a full head of hair , except for a round spot on top perhaps caused by standing on his head , and he wore it in the style of Albert Einstein . <p> Among his admirers was novelist Upton Sinclair , who became interested in food-related issues after attending a Macfadden health camp . Sinclair later wrote his muckraking novel The Jungle , which set off a federal investigation and led to the regulation of the meatpacking industry . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macfadden 's " America 's Most Perfectly Developed Man " contest . With the winnings , he went on to establish his own muscle-building business under the name of Charles Atlas , whose advertising line " I was a 97-pound weakling " became a long-running national joke . <p> Readers who took Macfadden 's advice about things he really knew improved their life and health . Unfortunately , Macfadden also offered ad-vice on a subject he knew very little about  --  coping with illness . He maintained that any disease could be cured by exercise and diet . He also emphasized fasting . He reasoned that much of the body 's energy went into digesting food : if there were no food to digest , then that energy could apply itself to recovering health . Macfadden claimed that fasting from three days to three weeks could alleviate and generally cure just about any disease , including asthma , bladder disease , diabetes , prostate disease , epilepsy , impotence , paralysis , liver and kidney disease , and eye trouble . <p> No matter what the sickness , Macfadden had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure syphilis and other blood diseases as well as Bright 's disease , cancer , epilepsy and goiter . His remedy for heart disease was hot and cold compresses , vegetables and cold water . The only treatment he accepted from conventional healthcare professionals was dentistry . <p> The American Medical Association did n't react publicly to his advice or his jibes . " The morons that take Macfadden seriously would not be convinced by anything we might publish , " said Dr. Arthur J. Cramp , an AMA spokesman . Macfadden thought the silence ominous and for years harbored fears that the AMA was poisoning the wells on his Englewood , New Jersey , estate . <p> Campaigning against prudery was another Macfadden crusade . He believed that a well-developed body should be appreciated and admired . Late in 1905 , he staged an exhibition of beauty and brawn at Madison Square Garden to publicize his magazine . To advertise the show he distributed posters of young women wearing two layers of union suit , the nearest thing to tights then permitted . The posters got the attention of Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society for the Suppression of Vice , a private establishment , who had Macfadden arrested . Macfadden was found guilty of violating New York state law and given a suspended sentence . <p> As a result of the case , he found a friend and ally in George Bernard Shaw , who was being harassed by Comstock for the staging of his play Mrs. Warren 's Profession . The two men visited each other frequently over the years . According to one of Macfadden 's wives , they " sat up all night trading stories , comparing muscles and congratulating each other on having found the secret of eternal youth . " <p> Readers of Physical Culture wrote to Macfadden for help with their personal problems : " I made this one mistake and now my wife wants to leave me " . . . " He promised to divorce his wife and marry me and now I 'm going to have a baby . " Physical Culture began printing those letters , and they got good readership . Macfadden concluded if that was what people liked to read , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1919 , he launched True Story , the first confession magazine . Its stories were about men and women tempted into wrongdoing who eventually gained redemption . The wrongdoing was usually sex , but mostly by implication . There was nothing like True Story , and it found a market among a large group of people who normally did not buy magazines . It had been widely believed by editors of popular magazines and romance novels that secretaries and shop girls wanted to read about the love lives of duchesses and heiresses . Macfadden discovered that secretaries and shop girls were more interested in reading about the romances of secretaries and shop girls . True Story made him a wealthy man . <p> The success of True Story led to imitations from competing publishers . Macfadden 's answer was his own imitations , True Romance , True Experiences and Dream World . After them came True Detective Mysteries and Master Detective . Subsequently he began Model Airplane News , Your Home , Ghost Stories , Movie Weekly and Movie Mirror and bought Photoplay and Shadowplay . His biggest magazine coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Saturday Evening Post and Collier 's . By 1935 his magazines had a combined circulation surpassing those of the other giants of magazine publishing , Hearst , Luce and Curtis . <p> Wealth made little change in Macfadden . He looked like a bum . Disdaining fashion , he wore the same suit every day until it fell apart . Because of his appearance he was often refused admittance to his own office buildings . He had no talent for small talk . If the subject was n't physical fitness , business or his brilliance , he was n't interested . Except for Dickens , he read nothing for entertainment . Taken to an opera , he said : " Nobody can like this sort of thing . Anyone who says so is posing . " He was enthusiastic , though , about the upper-body exercise the conductor was getting . <p> His only nonbusiness interest was women , and he pursued them throughout his life . When Macfadden was 66 , a man sued him for alienating the affections of his wife . After the wife testified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , the jury cleared him . At the offices of Macfadden Publications , a running joke was : " What time is it ? It 's always sex o'clock around here . " <p> Although Macfadden was a strong advocate of marriage and family , he did n't handle these institutions very well himself . He married for the first time at 30 and the second time at 35 , but neither union lasted two years . Then , while on a lecture tour in England , he met and married Mary Williamson , a 19-year-old swimming champion . He was then 45 . He made her part of his show , posing her in flesh-colored tights . The high point of each evening was when 142-pound Mary jumped from a platform to land feet-first on the abdomen of Macfadden , who was lying on the stage seven feet below . <p> Bernarr and Mary produced seven children , and he inflicted his medical theories on all of them . When a son , 11-month-old Byron , went into convulsions , Mary Macfadden pleaded for a doctor . Bernarr refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy died an hour later . <p> With the surge in income from True Story , Macfadden founded the infamous New York Evening Graphic in 1924 . According to his close associates , he started the Graphic so that it could give him the publicity he could n't get from the other newspapers . " It was to be his magic carpet . . . to the White House , " said Fulton Oursler , Macfadden 's longtime chief editor . <p> There were two sensational tabloid dailies in New York in 1924 , the Daily News and the Mirror . Macfadden decided to out-tabloid them . His Graphic specialized in covering sex , scandal and violence . It was heavy on photo-graphs . When it could n't get a photo-graph of some sensational event , such as a sex scandal or a hanging , Harry Grogin , the art director , made a " composograph , " a picture made up of other photographs , often of scenes created with members of the Graphic staff . <p> The Graphic , referred to by many as the " pornoGraphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its content was too racy for many big advertisers . It lost money steadily and went into bankruptcy in 1932 . <p> The Graphic supported Jimmy Walker in his successful 1925 campaign to become the mayor of New York . Macfadden hoped he could enter politics by being appointed the city 's commissioner of health . Walker did n't offer him the job . " Everybody knows you can live to be a hundred by following Macfadden 's ideas , " said Walker , who became known as the playboy mayor . " But New York wants to live the way I do . That 's why I was elected . We wo n't last as long , but we 'll have more fun . " <p> In 1928 , Macfadden sent one of his executives to Tammany Hall , the central force of the New York Democratic Party , to ask how much he needed to donate to be nominated for the governorship of New York . Judge George W. Olvaney , the boss of Tam-many Hall , rejected the idea . " When you imagine Bernarr Macfadden as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop you from having if he got elected , " said Olvaney . <p> That year Macfadden pursued both Republican Presidential nominee Herbert Hoover and Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith to create a federal Department of Health , with him as Secretary . When Hoover was elected , Macfadden and his publications supported him . When Roosevelt defeated Hoover in 1932 , Macfadden promptly supported Roosevelt . <p> Macfadden 's powers of persuasion were as formidable as his physique . Somehow he was able to convince Eleanor Roosevelt to become the editor of a new magazine , Babies  --  Just Babies . Apparently he reasoned that if he could insinuate himself into Mrs. Roosevelt 's favor , he could maneuver his way to becoming the first Secretary of Health . He thought that President Roosevelt 's health would fail soon , and who would make a better replacement than a conspicuously vigorous member of the Cabinet like himself ? Although she was probably not aware of those machinations , the First Lady had the good sense to withdraw from Babies  --  Just Babies soon after her appointment . <p> By 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , while attending a luncheon of the Republican Club of St. Louis , Macfadden declared that if the Republicans offered him their nomination for the Presidency , he would not refuse it . His announcement triggered a surge of apathy among Republican leaders and giggles throughout the country . Subsequently he tried and failed miserably to get himself elected governor of Florida and mayor of New York . <p> Macfadden 's political ambition contained the seeds of his financial ruin . In 1924 , he incorporated his privately held Physical Culture Publishing Company as Macfadden Publications , Inc. , and sold its stock publicly . As president of the corporation and majority owner of its stock , he felt entitled to use corporate funds for political donations , publicity agents , airplanes and private expenses . In 1940 , stockholders filed suit in federal court , accusing Macfadden of spending about $900,000 of the corporation 's money for his own personal and political expenses . In a settlement , Macfadden resigned as president , sold his stock to the new management and paid $300,000 to the corporation . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had formed years earlier to spread his teachings . Through it he published a magazine called Health Review , a tepid reincarnation of Physical Culture . He was n't poor , but he was running out of money . He tried to stay in the public eye with Cosmotarianism , the religion he founded in 1947 . It was based on the idea that those who took good care of their bodies would go to heaven . <p> At the age of 80 , Macfadden married for the fourth time . ( He and Mary were divorced in 1946 after years of separation . ) His bride was 42-year-old Johnnie Lee McKinney , a professional health lecturer . Macfadden insisted that they maintain separate apartments and not intrude on each other without calling first . The idea , he explained , was to keep the marriage fresh , the dew always on the rose . When Johnnie Lee violated that rule one day , she found her 82-year-old husband in bed with another woman . After accumulating further evidence of Macfadden 's unfaithfulness , she divorced him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory . He was twice jailed for nonpayment of alimony to Johnnie Lee . <p> In the fall of 1955 , he suffered intestinal problems and began fasting to cure them . The manager of the seedy New Jersey hotel he lived in found him unconscious and called an ambulance . Luckily for his peace of mind , Macfadden was probably not aware of what he would have considered the ultimate humiliation . He was taken to the Jersey City Medical Center , where he was x-rayed , fed intravenously and treated by a team of doctors . His problem was diagnosed as jaundice aggravated by fasting . When he died not long after being admitted , the onetime multimillionaire 's estate amounted to less than $5,000 . He was 87  --  a ripe old age , to be sure , but still more than 60 years short of his lofty goal . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Still nimble at 78 , fitness champion Bernarr Macfadden shows off his good health with schoolchildren in New York . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Macfadden , who launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to create a publishing empire worth , at its peak , more than $30 million . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Covering his political bases in 1931 , Macfadden tried to ingratiate himself with potential Presidential candidate Roosevelt . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Macfadden and his fourth wife , Johnnie Lee , demonstrate an exercise for the hair . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : In his magazines and personal life , Macfadden , seen here about 1920 , advocated health , exercise and an end to prudery . <p> By Joseph F.
