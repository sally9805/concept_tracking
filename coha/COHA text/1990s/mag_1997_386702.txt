Plus an easy-to-organize pack and a mini-test of comfy camp chairs . // Mountain Hardwear Skylight On a recent morning in New Hampshire 's White Mountains , I was in the midst of a wonderful dream about bacon , eggs , homefries , and buttered English muffins , when a rude thunkthwack-plunk awakened me . Stomach growling , I forced one eye open and spied fat , slushy flakes pelting my nylon shelter . I was n't too crazy about seeing snow , but I was thrilled with the view I had . Thanks to the clear plastic window on the fly of Mountain Hardwear 's new Skylight tent , I could finally enjoy storms without getting drenched . The Skylight , a three-season shelter with a floor shaped like a double-wide mummy , proved a pleasant companion on autumn hikes in New England , and I quickly became enamored with the innovative moonroof . With a glimpse of cloudy skies , I would dive deeper into my sleeping bag . When sunlight streamed through , I could rouse my perpetually sluggish hiking buddy and lobby for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Milky Way . Through nice and nasty conditions , the environment inside this two-per son tent stayed cheerful , light , and breezy , thanks largely to the window , rather than the neutral aquagreen color of the tent . The Skylight boasts lots of mesh , from a long strip that bisects the canopy , to small vents at its head and foot , to a large porthole window opposite the screen door . Even with the fly cinched tight and the vestibule zipped shut , there was little humidity or stagnant air , a welcome feature on steamy summer nights with stinky socks hanging from the ceiling . This tent ventilated so well , in fact , that we felt every puff of wind on sticky summer eves . That also haunted us when we tried to stretch the Skylight into a fourth season one frosty winter weekend . With so much mesh , the Skylight requires a full-coverage fly . Low to the ground and fitted with adjustable stake-out loops to loosen or tighten its fit , the fly kept rain from dripping or blowing onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off our fresh air . Ample space between the fly and canopy allowed air to move freely through the vents and around the ceiling . Only when I neglected to stake the fly did the atmosphere inside get clammy . An integral vestibule likewise turned back the elements , though its limited capacity meant that our packs slept outside . Pitched out just far enough to shelter the tent 's inner sanctum and mesh door , the vestibule slants at a low angle to the ground . This leaves a broad but shallow space that 's adequate for shucking boots and stowing raingear , but too cramped for undressing or neatly storing two full-size packs . Without an extra pole to lend height and depth , this vestibule also leaves little margin for cooking . At 6 ' 6 " , I loved the tent 's length , which left room below my feet for camera gear and a pile of clothes , but the low ceiling and close walls would make me think twice about taking it on an extended outing . Only 3 feet wide at the toes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely accommodates two standard width sleeping pads . While I 'll happily sacrifice an extra-wide berth to shave a pound or two ( the Skylight weighs in at under 6 pounds ) a friendship can be tested when two grown men start swapping chili burps at close range . Photograph This compact , lightweight tent features a clear overhead window for weather watchers and stargazers. // Aside from the Skylight 's narrow confines , this tent was easy to enjoy . Four mesh pockets provided ample space for my maps , headlamp , gloves , and portable chess set , and the privacy panel , which sports its own built-in pouch , doubled as a storage shelf for bulkier items . Setup took 5 minutes to master and only an extra second or two in the dark . On several rainy afternoons I had all three poles clipped in and the fly buckled down long before any puddles could form . Overall , the Skylight impressed me as a breezy , weatherworthy tent that 's ideal for stargazers , meteorologists , skinny people , and really close friends . - Jonathan Dorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pack for a hike along Washington 's Hoh River to Mt . Olympus . You see , lately I 've been living with internal frame backpacks , cramming all my gear into one of those slender , single sacks and then making a mess of it all when I needed something from within . It was usually while staring at my gear lying on the ground that I 'd fondly remember all the pockets on my 27year-old external frame pack-the one gathering dust back in my bam . How much easier trail life seemed when my old favorite was riding on my back . And so it was that the memories came flooding back as I organized my junk into the nine generously sized pockets on the new K2 Shortbed Loadmaster . Photograph MH SKYLIGHT : With the fly removed , the Skylight was plenty breathable , thanks to expansive swatches of mesh on the canopy . // Load hauling was the other thing I recalled , with mixed emotions , from olden days . The sack on an external is usually generous to begin with , but its proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of that frame to be used for lashing . Stuff sacks filled with sleeping bags or tents , loose items ranging from thermal pads to tripods , all can be lashed below or above the main compartment . The Shortbed amplifies on this tradition because the top bar of the frame extends 4 inches , lifting the sack with it . Revealed is a huge 10inch cargo space . This came in handy on my journey up the Hoh because I lashed an internal frame pack to this lower space-the pack I 'd carry during my icy climb up Mt . Olympus . The downside to all that cubic footage is that it 's not filled with helium . I wisely did n't weigh my load on the Hoh , but I know it was too much and probably in the 80-pound range . I was hauling gear for the filming of BACKPACKER 's new TV show , Anyplace Wild , to be aired on PBS this summer ( see the upcoming June issue for a program guide ) . This was one time I was glad I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-inch nylon strap across the hips . Ouch . Suspension systems have , thank heaven , undergone a revolution since the old days , and the Loadmaster displays some interesting features . Of course , the hipbelt is nicely padded and there 's a good lumbar pad , too . The shoulder harness adjusts easily up and down to fit a wide range of torsos . But such features are expected these days . More innovative is a set of fiberglass stays that transfer much of the pack weight to the front of the hipbelt . Adjustable tension straps let you customize the weight distribution . // K2 SHORTBED LOAD MASTER Photograph K2 SHORTBED : Pockets galore make this pack easy to live out of and the fiberglass stays ( encased in purple ) transfer weight to your hips . // The packbag itself is outstanding . The fabric is extremely tough and the stitches properly finished , the lid is well designed for shedding water , the pockets are ample and thoughtfully proportioned , and there 's an access zipper to the lower sack . In short , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my gripes . I developed sore spots just below and in front of my hips . It felt like the hipbelt did n't want to carry the weight on my bones , but instead placed it just below them . I shrunk the torso length and adjusted various straps for the 18-mile hike out , and was much more comfortable , although I did n't feel I ever got it completely right . Was this just my physiology or my lack of fitting talents ? I do n't know , so I recommend that you pay special attention to the hipbelt fit when you try this pack on in the store . My other gripe is that a little piece of hook-and-loop material anchors the lumbar pad/hipbelt combination . The pad never slipped out of place while I was carrying the pack , but it routinely peeled away when I took the pack off . The bottom line is that , other than the near weightlessness of my old external frame ( a feathery 3 1/2 pounds ) , I 'll never pine for it again . The K2 Shortbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 90s .
