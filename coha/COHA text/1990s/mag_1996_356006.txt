Maybe we ought to just forget it  --  bury romantic comedy in the graveyard of genres dearly departed and move on . It was unquestionably the loveliest invention of the movies ' golden age . But ours is not the golden age of anything  --  certainly not of romance or of high wit , surely not of that tolerant class consciousness that animated so many of those 1930s comedies . You know the old drill : rich boy meets poor girl ( or vice versa ) , the disparities in their backgrounds  --  the very thing that first attracted them  --  sunders their romance until , defying convention , they get together at last . But in modern America , where the rich  --  nouveau spendthrifts aside  --  are careful not to act rich , and the poor think they 're middle class , and therefore have no hesitation about aspiring above their stations , this plot does n't work anymore . Instead , we have items like The Mirror Has Two Faces , where the thing keeping Gregory Larkin ( Jeff Bridges ) and Rose Morgan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celibate ideal . <P> No , they are not in religious orders ; they 're professors at secular Columbia . But they are caught in the grip of a really dumb idea . He thinks all his problems in life derive from his inability to stay out of the beds of sexually desirable but otherwise destructive women . He decides instead to form a companionate liaison with a woman who is his mental equal , but is otherwise  --  how to put this gently ?  --  a bowwow . Rose , we are to understand , is so desperate that she goes along with him , thinking that once they 're married his resistance to her will break down . <P> Richard LaGravenese is one of the few screenwriters left who can write smart dialogue for grownups to speak , but that skill only occasionally distracts from the desperation of his basic conceit . Bridges is a terrific actor , but , putting it mildly , he 's miscast in the Doris Day role . And Streisand is a terrific presence , but also a performer who never forgets who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Mirror 's love theme , she is not about to let us forget it , either . " Second Hand Roses " have been part of her act , part of her calculations , for over 30 years , during which time we have learned that sooner or later the guy is going to respond to her inner light . <P> This glow is only half hidden under her shapeless clothes , half disguised by her boisterous enthusiasm for baseball , half explained by her relationship with an ego-flattening mom ( Lauren Bacall , dripping comic venom in award-winning doses ) . In short , the fine feathers of a star we all know to be a strong , smart and sexy woman keep peeking through her ugly-duckling getup . This spoils whatever suspense this story might hold , and most of its humorous potential too . Unacknowledged vanity is ever the enemy of comedy . And , come to think of it , of romance as well . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel                 @ @ @ @
