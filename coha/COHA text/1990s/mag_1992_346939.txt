To begin his climb from the electoral cellar , George Bush needed a fortnight of seamless good fortune : a small triumph of diplomacy with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , James Baker 's return to political service , then a smooth glide to Houston for joyous coronation by a united Republican Party . Maybe the convention week will go that way . But in the first half of the Republican fortnight , the President seemed unable to awake from what is turning out to be a nightmarish fight for re-election . <P> The meeting with Rabin went well enough until the closing press conference , when a CNN reporter threw a question that had rested half-buried like a live grenade from an old war . Had Bush , as Vice President , participated in a " sexual tryst " with a longtime assistant ? Unsubstantiated gossip about Bush and Jennifer Fitzgerald had floated among reporters and politicians  --  including Bush 's staff  --  since the early ' 80s , then escaped last week through a brassy headline in the New York Post based on a brief reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the President responded . <P> An appearance later on NBC entangled the President in another issue . What would he do if his granddaughter someday sought an abortion ? George Bush , the grandfather , answered sensibly and humanely : He would try to dissuade her but would stand by her , regardless of the decision , which would ultimately be hers . That sounded too close for comfort to the idea that each woman should have the final say , and thus came close to contradicting the Republican position that would outlaw abortion . <P> As news of that exchange circulated , the conservative faithful in Houston were pummeling moderates who had sought to soften the party 's rigid pro-life platform position . The pro-choice faction had been led to believe that they would get at least a token concession , a sign the party would lean at least a little toward the " big tent " concept its late chairman , Lee Atwater , had formulated . But the platform drafters not only flattened the pro-choice faction ; they also took a hard line against gay rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinite moratorium on new business regulation . Donald Devine , one of the many right-wing activists monitoring the platform , labeled this collection of planks " as conservative , or more so , than any since 1980 . " <P> While Bush placated true believers , they alone can not produce an electoral majority without reinforcements from moderates and independents . Winning them becomes more difficult the further right Bush drifts . As he bid farewell to the State Department , Jim Baker sounded an inclusive note : " There is a conservative agenda for helping people and for responding to their needs . We want to empower them to make their own choices , to break away from dependency . We want to give them economic security , a stake in society . " He was , at last , describing for Republicans a purpose that his friend George Bush had been unable to articulate amid all the distraction .
