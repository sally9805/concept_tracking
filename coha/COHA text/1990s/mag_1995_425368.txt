Section : COMPANY PROFILE Like every other shoemaker , third-generation family business Rocky Shoes and Boots has seen its industry transformed by imports , mergers , offshore manufacturing , and new technologies . Unlike most , Rocky has managed to come out ahead <p> The years have n't been kind to America 's small old-line manufacturers . <p> Time was , those businesses were the economic heart of small towns and city neighborhoods . Their employees were often longtimers , on a first-name basis with the boss . <p> The companies provided steady work , steady pay , and the self-respect that accompanies both . <p> Then came the maelstrom of the past two decades , the imports and the new technologies and everything else that turned the business world upside down . The market 's demands grew relentless . A new economy , fast-paced and tumultuous , came into being . <p> Like beachfront cottages in a hurricane , the old manufacturers were buffeted and battered . Many collapsed . Others were sold off , bought out , combined , and recombined until they were scarcely recognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were most of the workers . <p> But now and then you stumble across a survivor , a small old-line manufacturing company that has stood its ground against the tides of history  --  a company that somehow , on the fly , learned to compete in today 's turbulent marketplace . <p> The scene of one such unlikely story is Nelsonville , Ohio , a dot on the map near the West Virginia border . The industry is shoe manufacturing , as brutal a business as you 'll find anywhere . The company is Rocky Shoes and Boots Inc. , the fellow in charge Mike Brooks . <p> Brooks , like his father before him , belongs to that uncommon and unheralded breed of American businessperson : the kind who does n't know when  --  or maybe does n't know how  --  to quit . <p> MIKE BROOKS COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN HIMSELF . IT WAS THE spring of 1975 , and he had taken the phone call at his office in Milwaukee . Now he was excited , antsy . Back home in Nelsonville , Ohio , Dad was buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a predictable , even inevitable , move . Bill Brooks , Mike 's great-uncle , had started the business back in 1932 , in the heart of the Great Depression . Mike 's dad , John Brooks , worked in the plant full-time since age 17 . The company was his whole life . <p> By another reckoning , though , buying the company was crazy . Shoe manufacturing in the United States had been on a long downhill slope . Great-uncle Bill had announced he was selling the company way back in 1958 , and Mike 's dad had asked for a chance to match the buyer 's price . But Bill had refused point-blank . John , he had said , you have a family to support . The shoe industry has no future . I 'm doing you a favor . <p> So the business had gone to outsiders , a women's-shoe company in nearby Lancaster . John stayed on , eventually rising to plant manager . Mike worked summers at the factory , but he could see it held no long-term opportunities . Nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of maybe 5,000 in the hilly , rural countryside southeast of Columbus . Mike loved the place . But when he left after high school , he never expected to return . <p> Now , in 1975 , the owners were getting ready to unload or shut down the business . And John Brooks was telling Mike that this time , finally , he was really going to buy it . <p> The next day , Mike walked into his employer 's office and resigned . " I told my boss , " he recalls , " that my father was buying a business and needed his son back . " <p> Of course , it was n't quite that simple . Maybe buying a business never is . The company was n't worth much as a going concern , but it owned plant and equipment worth close to $1.3 million . John had bargained the owners down to 50 cents on the dollar , so the purchase price was $640,000 . He had worked for a modest salary all his life and had raised five children . He figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come from somewhere else . Where , he was n't quite sure . Mike did n't know , either . The William Brooks Shoe Co. would n't be high on anyone 's list of hot investments or good loan prospects . Its machinery was aging . Its work force was discouraged . The company had lost money for three years running . <p> On the other hand , there were dreams at stake here . Mike 's father 's , certainly . Mike 's own , increasingly . And maybe those of his four siblings . Then there were the jobs and livelihoods of the 140 or so people who worked at the company , most of them neighbors or acquaintances of the Brooks family . Mike , the oldest son in the family , had never lacked self-confidence . When college had n't worked out , he set off for Milan , Italy , and spent a year studying shoe design at the well-known Ars Satoria trade school . His business career already showed promise ; it included stints at U.S. Shoe Corp . and at two tanning companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd be damned if a few hundred thousand dollars would get in the way of those dreams . He and his father visited banks . They looked into government-guaranteed loans . They began talking about saving jobs . They called their congressman . <p> Soon enough , the Farmers Home Administration agreed to guarantee 90% of the purchase price . A five-bank consortium would provide the rest . Some of those banks were nervous and showed up at the closing with lawyers , forms to sign , and a barrage of questions . Vic Oakley , president of the lead bank in the consortium , the one picking up most of the risk , was a Nelsonville neighbor of the Brookses ' . He arrived late , with no forms or lawyers , just a check . He threw it onto the table . " If John Brooks says he 'll pay me back , " he announced , " he 'll pay me back . " Then he walked out . <p> So the papers were signed , the money was provided , and the William Brooks Shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , the largest employer in Nelsonville , finally belonged to John Brooks . John rechristened the business John W. Brooks Inc . Then he went back to managing the factory , which was his first love . As for running the business , that would be mostly up to Mike . <p> The year is 1975 . The United States is emerging from the worst downturn since the 1930s . But the next few years wo n't bring the kind of swift , sure recovery Americans once could expect . Growth is slow . Inflation threatens to spiral out of control . U.S. manufacturers find themselves attacked by powerful overseas competitors . Imports from steel to semiconductors flood onto American shores , eating up market share . <p> The Midwest is hit hard . So many plants close that pundits coin the term Rustbelt to describe the region . As for the shoe industry , it has gone from the stagnation of the late 1950s into sharp decline . In 1970 imports accounted for 30% of the market . Ten years later the figure will be 50% and rising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut their doors  --  for good . <p> FOR A WHILE MIKE DID N'T WORRY MUCH about the economy or about the sorry state of his industry . He had too much to do , and he was having too good a time doing it . <p> He designed a new product , a good-looking pair of hiking boots with red laces , and hit the road to sell it . He worked with his father to speed up production , thus easing the company 's cash needs . He spent time on the factory floor , trying to pep up a demoralized work force . What made the whole project seem possible , even exciting , was that a couple of other young men , age-mates , were already at the company and were eager to join the fray . Dave Fraedrich , hired by John Brooks right out of college , was the financial guy . Bob Hollenbaugh , a childhood buddy of Mike 's , managed shipping and personnel and purchasing . The group became a kind of entrepreneurial troika . Each did a little of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot out their collective future . In their dreams , it was exhilarating . In reality , it was the late 1970s , and no one could ignore the tides of history for long . Mike and his pals might be young and hopeful , but they were caught in the squeeze on margins that was strangling manufacturers all over the United States . <p> On the revenue side , Brooks 's customers were the same big chains the company had always sold to . Sears and J.C . Penney bought 80% of the plant 's output . The chains might like new designs , such as the red-laced hiking boots . They might appreciate Brooks 's reputation for quality . But what they really cared about was price  --  and now , with the growing availability of imports , they could put the screws on . Mike could sell a lot of shoes to those customers . He just could n't sell them at prices that would keep his company in business over the long haul . <p> The cost side of the ledger looked equally bleak . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . Manufacturing techniques such as just-in-time and Toyota-style " lean production " had n't yet made their way across the Pacific . Big corporations in a similar situation might have cut costs by eliminating layers of management . Here , that was hardly an option . Brooks was an $8-million company run by a few managers and their helpers , all crammed into a tiny warren of offices on the second floor of the aging plant . None of them took much of a salary . <p> One day in 1979 , in a meeting with a buyer for Sears , Mike finally understood that he was losing the battle . <p> At an earlier meeting he had asked the buyer for a price increase of 50 cents a pair . He knew it would be a shock , but he had steeled himself ; the company could n't survive without higher margins . The buyer , an old-timer , was n't just shocked , he was outraged . He asked Mike if his father knew what he was doing , and demanded to speak with John in person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to fly , the 400 miles from Nelsonville to Chicago . At the meeting , Mike felt he was hung out to dry . John , worried about losing Sears 's orders , waffled on the price hike . Mike , stubborn , stuck to his guns . " I said , Look , we want your business . But we do n't want to be at breakeven anymore . ' " <p> At the end , Mike thought grimly , the meeting degenerated into a good news , bad news joke . The good news : Sears agreed to the 50 cent hike . The bad news : the deal was good only until the big chain could replace Brooks as a supplier , probably with a Korean manufacturer . <p> " It was a long drive home , " recalls Mike , sighing . " We had been promised the increase . But we had only a few months to live . " <p> The 1980s . The floundering economy is now showing signs of life  --  even in manufacturing . America 's industrial giants  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Japanese . Entrepreneurial companies elbow their way into the marketplace . <p> In shoes , the rejuvenation is dramatic : several upstart companies begin to prosper . Making an end run around the classic margin squeeze , they develop distinctive products , stamp a brand name on them , and charge premium prices . They sell their shoes through new retail channels , not just the old shoe stores and department stores . They advertise heavily . In athletic shoes the leading practitioner of this strategy is Nike . In boots it is Timberland . <p> But there is no middle ground . Old manufacturers in the Midwest and elsewhere keep going under . The shoe business loses another 300 plants . Grow or die , goes the saying . <p> AS IF BY INTUITION , MIKE BROOKS HAD already begun to position his company for success in what was then an unfamiliar new marketplace . <p> While selling to Sears , for example , he had tacked a name onto some of the red-laced hiking boots . Rocky , he decided , " sounded strong and bold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a picture of a bighorn sheep on it , and he put the boots in it . Then he took Bob Hollenbaugh out of the factory and told him to start selling . Hollenbaugh knocked on the doors of independent stores in Ohio and nearby states . He made sales at margins far higher than Sears would ever have given the company . In 1983 the company began marketing " occupational " shoes , the kind worn by police officers and letter carriers , under the Rocky brand . The move opened up not only a new market but a new distribution network . Gradually , Mike saw that he had to reinvent the whole business . Like Timberland , his company had to be capable of making a distinctive product  --  and then selling it , at comfortable margins , through whatever channels might be most appropriate . The company also had to broaden and deepen its line . You could n't build a powerful brand with just the four Rocky boots it was then offering . <p> What Mike did n't know  --  could n't know  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would accept the radical changes growth would entail . He knew that the older man did n't like change . What John wanted was to protect the company and the jobs it provided for his family and his Nelsonville neighbors . In John 's mind , Mike understood , that meant this : Keep it small . Keep it manageable . <p> So far , the unusual father-son arrangement had worked out surprisingly well . John ran the plant . He gave Mike his head in other areas . They did n't always see eye to eye , but they rarely argued . Mike made a point of listening to John 's advice . John took quiet pride in how Mike managed the business , and let him set the course . And in two critical areas , Mike 's new strategy clicked into place perfectly . <p> For one thing , Mike created a line of products that was innovative and distinctive  --  and that could n't be knocked off the next month in Korea or Taiwan . <p> The ace up Mike 's sleeve was Gore-Tex , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Cobbling together some early Gore-Tex boots , Mike and his colleagues had realized they were onto something . Retailers and customers loved the boots . No competitor could duplicate them without a serious investment of time and money . Expanding the Gore-Tex line , Mike developed a close relationship with W. L. Gore &; Associates , the material 's manufacturer . In 1989 Gore announced that it would thenceforth require all footwear customers to pay $25,000 for a license . Other manufacturers were furious at Gore 's audacity . To Mike , it was as if someone had erected a fence around his market , saying , Competitors Keep Out . Arriving on Gore 's doorstep with a check , he broke open a bottle of champagne with Bob Gore , the company 's chief executive . <p> The second strategic victory was equally important . In just a few years the Brooks company had created a new distribution network and a marketing strategy capable of selling to it . <p> Most of the marketing effort fell to Hollenbaugh , now sales manager . Hitting the road , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling to hundreds of retailers , mostly hunting and sporting-goods stores , mostly in the Midwest . It was a perfect market . The hunters and outdoorsmen who bought the boots valued their waterproof properties and would pay a premium for them . The fact that the boots carried the " Made in the USA " label was a plus . Hollenbaugh developed catalogs for the retailers . He learned how to do advertising . He masterminded campaigns in outdoor magazines . Sales rose . In 1988 the company passed the $20-million mark . <p> The late 1980s . Growing entrepreneurial companies are reshaping industry after industry . Most start with a clean slate  --  new technologies , a new work force , a " smart team " of savvy , seasoned executives . Typically , they boast the kind of managerial sophistication that was once found only in the Fortune 500 . <p> Old-line , family-owned companies are n't so lucky . Top executives tend to be blood relatives , which limits the talent pool . Family issues spill over into the business . Can family businesses even compete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS THE ' 80S WANED , MIKE BROOKS pushed ahead , one innovation or initiative following hard on the heels of another . <p> In 1989 , for example , the company brought out a waterproof boot made with Du Pont 's tough Cordura nylon in a camouflage pattern popular with hunters . Dubbed the Cornstalker , the boot became the company 's top seller . <p> A couple of years earlier Mike even took a step he once would have found difficult : he established first one offshore factory , and then another . <p> The reasons were n't hard to fathom . One , the Brooks boots , particularly their uppers , required huge amounts of hand labor . Two , the Nelsonville plant was running at capacity . It could n't easily be expanded , and doing so probably did n't make economic sense , anyway . In 1987 , looking for contractors in the Dominican Republic , Mike met Eric Beraza , a Spanish-speaking American and shoe-industry veteran who was running a plant there . Mike proposed that Beraza set up a Brooks plant and train its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running . With wages at that time less than $1 an hour there , the cost was competitive with anywhere else in the world . Later Beraza set up another factory , this one in Puerto Rico . Wages there were higher , but products made in Puerto Rico could be stamped Made in the USA . In the occupational-shoe market , that was a requirement . <p> And yet : the fact was , by 1990 , Mike Brooks was not a happy man . <p> Part of it , he knew , was the gnawing , stomach-churning feeling of never having enough cash . Making a seasonal product like hunting boots , the company had huge amounts of money tied up in raw materials and inventory for months at a time . Worse , every step along the growth path consumed capital . Fraedrich worked tirelessly on the finances , but he could never bring in as much cash as the company needed . Stores were clamoring for more hunting boots ? Tough luck : Brooks could n't finance the additional production . The plant and equipment were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace them . <p> Then there was the difficulty of coping with crises in what had become a far-flung enterprise . Mike had grown accustomed , for example , to hearing that the power in the Dominican plant had gone off for a few hours . He had bought some big diesel generators and sent them down so Beraza could keep the cutting and stitching machines running . But then , in 1990 , oil prices rose . The Dominican government abruptly ended its policy of subsidizing oil purchases . The country 's oil supply dropped to a trickle . Mike grew desperate . Without oil , the plant would shut down . He began loading the raw-materials containers that he shipped from Ohio to the Dominican plant with 55-gallon drums of diesel fuel . Was it legal ? He had no idea . <p> All those problems seemed to coalesce in what was an increasingly strained relationship with his father . <p> For most of the ' 80s , John Brooks had supported Mike , just as he had in the early years . To be sure , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor-intensive complexities of using Gore-Tex , he liked to say , set shoemaking back a hundred years . He looked back wistfully on the days when you did n't make shoes until you had an order from someone like Sears . But John had given Mike both his blessing and his financial imprimatur . The more the company grew , the more debt it had to take on . John was n't a rich man , but he had personally signed for every nickel , as the banks required . By the end of the decade , he was on the hook for some $10 million . <p> When Mike had proposed the first offshore factory , though , John drew a line in the sand . It was n't that he thought it was a terrible idea ; he was willing to let Mike build the Dominican plant . But do it with company funds ? No chance . Too risky . For almost the first time , the two men found themselves shouting at each other . Eventually , they found a compromise : Mike , John , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up some money of their own . Mike had to borrow his share from the bank . It irked him that he could n't spend company funds on a move he thought necessary for the company 's very survival . <p> From then on , the relationship was never quite as smooth . Mike wanted to expand the Dominican operation ; John was opposed . Mike talked about taking the company public ; John would n't hear of it . " I got close to leaving , " Mike says now , pausing to reflect . " Very close . Very , very close . " He had plenty of opportunities in the industry . But he did n't want to let the family down . <p> And then , one day in August 1991 , it was over . John came into Mike 's office . That 's it , he said . I 'm retiring . I 'm giving the business to you and your brothers and sisters . There were reasons . John was then 70 . His wife  --  Mike 's mother  --  was ill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John would no longer be the owner of the company , the banks wanted him off the note . All five siblings and their spouses would have to sign it . The total debt , by then , was $11.25 million . None of the Brooks siblings had significant funds of their own . <p> The 1990s . The new economy is in full bloom . Now the issue is who will get to play in it . Over time , entrepreneurial companies sort themselves out . Some stay small , content with tiny niches . Some look for bigger partners and vanish into the mergers-and-acquisitions maw . <p> But some go for the gold ring . They seek out the capital that will enable them to develop their lines , to expand their markets , to operate nationally or even internationally . <p> LOOKED AT COLDLY , THE LOGICAL NEXT step for the Brooks family would have been to sell the company . It would n't have been hard . Rocky had a well-known brand and a solid niche in the marketplace . It had a well-developed distribution network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mike , with his siblings , had just inherited a company  --  and he was n't selling , he was dreaming . By 1992 sales were nearing $30 million . He had just introduced a line of hand-sewn shoes , and he had some ideas about other lines . Put them together , he figured , and you could imagine a $100-million  --  even a $200-million  --  company . <p> But without money , it was all just fantasy . And Rocky had no money beyond what was needed to finance the factory and pay the interest . There was only one place to get the capital he needed : from the public markets . Mike and Dave Fraedrich met with potential underwriters . Eventually , they chose J. C. Bradford &; Co. , out of Nashville , and set in motion the complex mechanisms of an initial public offering . <p> You have to spend money to make money , Mike told himself . But he had n't quite realized how expensive and risky an IPO could be . The accountants got busy . So did the lawyers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be folded into the parent company , which was being renamed Rocky Shoes and Boots . By the time the prospectus was drafted and printed , the offering had cost Rocky some $630,000 , plus the time and expense Mike and Fraedrich had put into it . Yet no one could know how Wall Street would view an IPO from an obscure little shoe company in Ohio . <p> As it happened , by late 1992 initial public offerings were back in favor on the Street . Timberland stock was hot  --  it had more than doubled during 1992  --  so another outdoor-shoe company looked good . In January 1993 Mike and Fraedrich began the road show . <p> Like all road shows , it was grueling . After 10 days Mike was played out . At his last meeting  --  with a group of eager young analysts from Fidelity Investments , the big Boston-based mutual-fund house  --  he hit the wall . They asked questions . Why are you any different from Timberland ? How can you make money with U.S. manufacturing ? Mike had answered the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guys , we 're going to take this company public whether you buy any stock or not . ' I said , You can buy it at $10 a share , or do n't buy it . I do n't care . ' " He left for Logan airport in Boston and ordered up a double martini . <p> Before drinking it , he called his contact at Bradford to apologize for his behavior . Never mind , the Bradford guy said  --  Fidelity just ordered 150,000 shares . <p> <p> ROCKY SHOES AND BOOTS WENT PUBLIC on February 3 , 1993 , netting about $15 million . Ever since , money has been flowing through the parched company like water through an irrigation ditch , bringing dreams to fruition . <p> The old Nelsonville plant has undergone a metamorphosis . Last fall you could have caught it in midtransformation . Some sections of the plant were dark and dingy . Workers in those areas moved rack after rack of shoes-in-the-making from one station to another , much as they had done for the past 60 years . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of shoes under bright lights . Paid by their team 's output rather than by the traditional piece-rate system  --  and earning from $1 to $1.50 an hour more now than before  --  team members scurried to help one another with their jobs . Plant manager Allen Sheets estimated that the new system cut throughput time from 10 days to 3 , and that the 3 would soon be 2 . Mike figured that the cost of making a shoe dropped by 7% , even with the higher wages . In a business like shoemaking , that was the difference between scraping by and making decent money . <p> Behind the Nelsonville plant , ground has been broken for a new 12,000-square-foot retail store , a " mini L.L. Bean , " as Mike describes it . Nelsonville is n't on anybody 's main road , but so many people in this rural section of Ohio stop by Rocky that even the old store last year did $2.2 million . The new one , says Mike , should do more than $4 million . A little ways down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000-square-foot addition to its already-cavernous warehouse facilities . <p> How much more the company will grow is anybody 's guess . Already it 's the largest producer of Gore-Tex footwear in the world . This fiscal year , analysts say , it should top $50 million in sales . Investors are optimistic . Rocky 's stock , initially offered at $10 a share , peaked at more than $20 a share last November . As Inc. went to press , it was around $13 . To be sure , the footwear industry is still hazardous . By the end of 1993 the IPO money was invested , and the company again was back to bank loans . It had boosted production , but it still could n't meet existing demand . <p> For the moment , however , at least a few dreams have been realized . <p> John Brooks , nearing 73 , still comes in every morning at 7:30 . He has n't moved his office down the road , where Mike and the other managers sit ; it 's still in the plant . On John 's wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . There are no hard feelings about the disagreements over the offshore manufacturing . Though John divvied up the company among his children , he retained an interest in the Dominican plant . That interest , translated into Rocky stock , was worth about a million dollars . At the IPO , John cashed it in . When Mike gave him the check , John smiled . He said , " Hard to believe , is n't it , son ? " <p> Mike Brooks , 48 , has many of his dreams ahead of him . Right now what he feels is responsibility  --  for the business , for its employees , for its investors . The payroll now numbers more than 1,000 . There are 565 workers in the Dominican Republic , 230 in Puerto Rico , nearly 300 in Nelsonville . The list of investors includes a sizable number of individuals , many of whom are local . " A lot of people are counting on the company to be successful , " says Mike . " I feel a lot of pressure . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company has had on Nelsonville .
