MAKING SENSE OF THE SIXTIES ; PBS ; Jan. 21 , 22 , 23 <P> This decade mania is getting out of hand . Pundits had barely finished figuring out what distinguished the ' 80s from the ' 70s ( now what was that difference again ? ) when they set about trying to characterize the ' 90s , a decade still in diapers : the " get real " decade ; the Nervous ' 90s . How about the Name-Obsessed ' 90s ? <P> Ah , but the ' 60s ; now there was a decade to reckon with . It had personality and definition ; it made an impact . It was the decade of the Beatles and the Kennedys , Vietnam and Kent State , the Generation Gap and the Credibility Gap . Negroes became blacks , and black became beautiful ; the campuses exploded ; draft cards went up in smoke ; and sexual taboos disintegrated . When the ' 60s ended ( sometime early in the ' 70s ) , the world  --  and we  --  had changed . <P> The very momentousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the six-hour PBS series Making Sense of the Sixties . So many pieces of the story have been told so often , in documentaries from Eyes on the Prize to Berkeley in the ' 60s , that a curtain of boredom threatens to fall even before the stage is set . Much of the material is distressingly familiar : the expected film clips ( Martin Luther King , Woodstock , the Democrats at war in Chicago ) annotated with the expected cliches ( " The age of heroes was over " ) . <P> Yet the series pierces the fog of familiarity with a strong sense of direction . A key decision was to focus not on the big events but on the sociological shifts that the decade engendered . The people interviewed are , for the most part , not well-known personalities but articulate ordinary people : campus activists , Vietnam veterans , former hippies , union leaders , teachers , parents . Many of the clips have a grass-roots freshness ( a dropout cheerfully concludes an impromptu lecture on the evils of the work ethic by saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to destroy the United States " ) . And if there are some curious historical lapses ( the show recounts the collapse of Lyndon Johnson 's presidency without once mentioning Eugene McCarthy ) , the series makes a respectable stab at fulfilling the promise of its title . The decade does make a little more sense . <P> The youth rebellion of the ' 60s , the documentary points out , was a logical reaction against the conformist , prosperity-driven , communism-obsessed ' 50s . The revolt was especially threatening to Middle America because it went beyond politics and challenged the fundamental values of society . And if it ultimately failed to achieve its more grandiose goals , it left its mark in myriad ways , from college ethnic-studies departments to a new role for women . " Maybe the youth rebellion did n't get what it wanted , " the narrator asserts . " But perhaps this generation  --  and America  --  got what it needed . " In a program that utilizes music cannily , the song that accompanies the closing credits is a symbolic summing up : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side .
