On a hot Sunday last summer my friend Tony and I drove my rental car , a ' ' 91 Buick , from St. Paul to the small town of Waconia , Minnesota , forty miles southwest . We each had a project . Waconia is Tony 's boyhood home , and his sister had recently given him a panoramic postcard of Lake Waconia as seen from a high point in the town early in the century . He wanted to duplicate the photograph 's vantage point , then hang the two pictures together in his house in Frogtown . I was hoping to see Tony 's father , Emmett , a retired mechanic , in order to settle a question that had been nagging me : Is it possible to get out of a locked car trunk ? We tried to call ahead to Emmett twice , but he was n't home . Tony thought he was probably golfing but that there was a good chance he 'd be back by the time we got there . So we set out . I parked the Buick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the graveyard near where Tony thought the picture had been taken . He took his picture and I wandered among the headstones , reading the epitaphs . One of them was chillingly anti-individualist . It said , " Not to do my will , but thine . " Trunk lockings had been on my mind for a few weeks . It seemed to me that the fear of being locked in a car trunk had a particular hold on the American imagination . Trunk lockings occur in many movies and books  --  from Goodfellas to Thelma and Louise to Humboldt 's Gift . And while the highbrow national newspapers generally shy away from trunk lockings , the attention they receive in local papers suggests a widespread anxiety surrounding the subject . In an afternoon at the New York Public Library I found numerous stories about trunk lockings . A Los Angeles man is discovered , bloodshot , banging the trunk of his white Eldorado following a night and a day trapped inside ; he says his captors went on joyrides and picked up women . A forty-eight-year-old Houston doctor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car is abandoned , parked near the Astrodome . A New Orleans woman tells police she gave birth in a trunk while being abducted to Texas . Tests undermine her story , the police drop the investigation . But so what if it 's a fantasy ? That only shows the idea 's hold on us . Every culture comes up with tests of a person 's ability to get out of a sticky situation . The English plant mazes . Tropical resorts market those straw finger-grabbers that tighten their grip the harder you pull on them , and Viennese intellectuals gave us the concept of childhood sexuality  --  figure it out , or remain neurotic for life . At least you could puzzle your way out of those predicaments . When they slam the trunk , though , you 're helpless unless someone finds you . You would think that such a common worry should have a ready fix , and that the secret of getting out of a locked trunk is something we should all know about . I phoned experts but they were very discouraging . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of pliers and bat 's eyes , yes . But you have to have a lot of knowledge of the lock , " said James Foote at Automotive Locksmiths in New York City . Jim Frens , whom I reached at the technical section of Car and Driver in Detroit , told me the magazine had not dealt with this question . But he echoed the opinion of experts elsewhere when he said that the best hope for escape would be to try and kick out the panel between the trunk and the backseat . That angle did n't seem worth pursuing . What if your enemies were in the car , crumpling beer cans and laughing at your fate ? It did n't make sense to join them . The people who deal with rules on auto design were uncomfortable with my scenarios . Debra Barclay of the Center for Auto Safety , an organization founded by Ralph Nader , had certainly heard of cases , but she was not aware of any regulations on the matter . " Now , if there was a defect involved  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk locking was all phobia . This must be one of the few issues on which she and the auto industry agree . Ann Carlson of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association became alarmed at the thought that I was going to play up a non-problem : " In reality this very rarely happens . As you say , in the movies it 's a wonderful plot device , " she said . " But in reality apparently this is not that frequent an occurrence . So they have not designed that feature into vehicles in a specific way . " When we got to Emmett 's one-story house it was full of people . Tony 's sister , Carol , was on the floor with her two small children . Her husband , Charlie , had one eye on the golf tournament on TV , and Emmett was at the kitchen counter , trimming fat from meat for lunch . I have known Emmett for fifteen years . He looked better than ever . In his retirement he had sharply changed his diet and lost a lot of weight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As always , his manner was humorous , if opaque . Tony told his family my news : I was getting married in three weeks . Charlie wanted to know where my fiancee was . Back East , getting everything ready . A big-time hatter was fitting her for a new hat . Emmett sat on the couch , watching me . " Do you want my advice ? " " Sure . " He just grinned . A gold tooth glinted . Carol and Charlie pressed him to yield his wisdom . Finally he said , " Once you get to be thirty , you make your own mistakes . " He got out several cans of beer , and then I brought up what was on my mind . Emmett nodded and took off his glasses , then cleaned them and put them back on . We went out to his car , a Mercury Grand Marquis , and Emmett opened the trunk . His golf clubs were sitting on top of the spare tire in a green golf bag . Next to them was a toolbox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of elbowed rods with red plastic handles he used to open door locks when people locked their keys inside . Tony and Charlie stood watching . Charlie is a banker in Minneapolis . He enjoys gizmos and is extremely practical . I would describe him as unflappable . That 's a word I always wanted to apply to myself , but my fiancee had recently informed me that I am high-strung . Though that surprised me , I did n't quarrel with her . For a while we studied the latch assembly . The lock closed in much the same way that a lobster might clamp on to a pencil . The claw portion , the jaws of the lock , was mounted inside the trunk lid . When you shut the lid , the jaws locked on to the bend of a U-shaped piece of metal mounted on the body of the car . Emmett said my best bet would be to unscrew the bolts . That way the U-shaped piece would come loose and the lock 's jaws would swing up with it still in their grasp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was already getting too technical . Emmett had an air of endless patience , but I felt defeated . I could only imagine bloodied fingers , cracked teeth . I had hoped for a simple trick . Charlie stepped forward . He reached out and squeezed the lock 's jaws . They clicked shut in the air , bound together by heavy springs . Charlie now prodded the upper part of the left-hand jaw , the thicker part . With a rough flick of his thumb , he was able to force the jaws to snap open . Great . Unfortunately , the jaws were mounted behind a steel plate the size of your palm in such a way that while they were accessible to us , standing outside the car , had we been inside the trunk the plate would be in our way , blocking the jaws . This time Emmett saw the way out . He fingered a hole in the plate . It was no bigger than the tip of your little finger . But the hole was close enough to the latch itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole from inside the trunk and nudge the jaws apart . We tried with one of my keys . The lock jumped open . It was time for a full-dress test . Emmett swung the clubs out of the trunk , and I set my can of Schmidt 's on the rear bumper and climbed in . Everyone gathered around , and Emmett lowered the trunk on me , then pressed it shut with his meaty hands . Total darkness . I could n't hear the people outside . I thought I was going to panic . But the big trunk felt comfortable . I was pressed against a sort of black carpet that softened the angles against my back . I could almost stretch out in the trunk , and it seemed to me I could make them sweat if I took my time . Even Emmett , that sphinx , would give way to curiosity . Once I was out he 'd ask how it had been and I 'd just grin . There were some things you could only learn by doing . It took a while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angled it to one side . The trunk gasped open . Emmett motioned the others away , then levered me out with his big right forearm . Though I 'd only been inside for a minute , I was disoriented  --  as much as anything because someone had moved my beer while I was gone , setting it down on the cement floor of the garage . It was just a little thing , but I could not be entirely sure I had gotten my own beer back . Charlie was now raring to try other cars . We examined the latch on his Toyota , which was entirely shielded to the trunk occupant ( i.e. , no hole in the plate ) , and on the neighbor 's Honda ( ditto ) . But a 1991 Dodge Dynasty was doable . The trunk was tight , but its lock had a feature one of the mechanics I 'd phoned described as a " tailpiece " : a finger-like extension of the lock mechanism itself that stuck out a half-inch into the trunk cavity ; simply by twisting the tailpiece I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1984 Subaru that had a little lever device on the latch . We went out to my rental on Oak Street . The Skylark was in direct sun and the trunk was hot to the touch , but when we got it open we could see that its latch plate had a perfect hole , a square in which the edge of the lock 's jaw appeared like a face in a window . The trunk was shallow and hot . Emmett had to push my knees down before he could close the lid . This one was a little suffocating . I imagined being trapped for hours , and even before he had got it closed I regretted the decision with a slightly nauseous feeling . I thought of Edgar Allan Poe 's live burials , and then about something my fiancee had said more than a year and a half before . I had been on her case to get married . She was divorced , and at every opportunity I would reissue my proposal  --  even during a commercial . She 'd interrupted one of these chirps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she had no intention of ever going through another divorce : " This time , it 's death out . " I 'd carried those words around like a lump of wet clay . As it happened , the Skylark trunk was the easiest of all . The hole was right where it was supposed to be . The trunk popped open , and I felt great satisfaction that we 'd been able to figure out a rule that seemed to apply about 60 percent of the time . If we publicized our success , it might get the attention it deserved . All trunks would be fitted with such a hole . Kids would learn about it in school . The grip of the fear would relax . Before long a successful trunk-locking scene would date a movie like a fedora dates one today . When I got back East I was caught up in wedding preparations . I live in New York , and the wedding was to take place in Philadelphia . We set up camp there with five days to go . A friend had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south with all our things . I unloaded the car in my parents ' driveway . The last thing I pulled out of the trunk was my fiancee 's hat in its heavy cardboard shipping box . She 'd warned me I was not allowed to look . The lid was free but I did n't open it . I was willing to be surprised . When the trunk was empty it occurred to me I might hop in and give it a try . First I looked over the mechanism . The jaws of the BMW 's lock were shielded , but there seemed to be some kind of cable coming off it that you might be able to manipulate so as to cause the lock to open . The same cable that allowed the driver to open the trunk remotely ... I fingered it for a moment or two but decided I did n't need to test out the theory .
