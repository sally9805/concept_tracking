Section : Arms for Illinois <p> They drew up the agenda , detailed the options , and gave the briefings . But they never told the President that searching for Iranian moderates ' would be the biggest mistake of his Administration . <p> This article is adapted from a chapter of Mr. Weinberger 's forthcoming book , Fighting for Peace . <p> THE IRAN-CONTRA affair was the one serious mistake the Reagan Administration made during the seven years I served as Secretary of Defense . The President 's motives were the best , and completely understandable to anyone who knew , as I did , his compassionate nature , and the revulsion he felt over Americans being held hostage by fanatical terrorists . But Mr. Reagan was badly served by some of his staff , who were unwilling to recognize their own severe limitations of intellect , knowledge , and morality . <p> I was not in office on November 4 , 1979 , when militant Iranian students seized our embassy in Teheran , kidnapping 66 Americans . My feelings about that incident were , I suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt strongly then and do to this day that conduct of the kind Iran exhibited during the seizure of our embassy completely disqualified it from any civilized intercourse with other nations . I feel that as long as the leadership in Iran remains as it is ( and in my opinion it has not changed substantively since Ayatollah Khomeini 's death ) , it is futile to expect that any kind of agreement with such a government would be of any value . I also thought , with some support from the intelligence community , that since 1984 most of those held hostage in the Middle East were kidnapped either by Iran directly or by its surrogates . <p> The plight of those hostages deeply concerned everyone in our Administration . We discussed many times the methods that might be pursued to bring them home , and each time we did , the President said , " Oh , that is what I most want to do . " <p> However , through all such discussions , there was one underlying , unchanging thread of agreement : we must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pay ransom , or its equivalent . We also understood  --  or I thought we all did  --  that any negotiations with the Ayatollah and his followers would be useless , and worse : their virulent anti-Americanism made agreements impossible , and ransoming our hostages would encourage Iranian fanatics to believe that all they would ever have to do to secure what they wished was simply seize an American . <p> ON OCTOBER 13 , 1983 , William P. Clark resigned as the President 's National Security Advisor to accept appointment as Secretary of the Interior . For the Defense Department that meant a major change for the worse in its relationship with the National Security Council staff . Bill Clark is one of my oldest friends , a skilled , resourceful , and highly effective attorney , later a respected judge , and one of the President 's earliest , and at all times most important and most loyal , friends . He was ideal for the role of Security Advisor , ensuring that all the different viewpoints reached the President on the many matters to be decided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the President and not himself . He knew that he could not serve the President if the President did not hear all viewpoints , and not simply those that coincided with some private agenda of the National Security Advisor . <p> Unfortunately , all of this drastically changed when Bill Clark resigned . I had pleaded with him to stay , and I am sure that if I had succeeded , the entire **29;29;TOOLONG problem would never have happened . If anyone had proposed such a scheme when Bill was in office , he would have rejected it immediately . <p> His successor was Robert McFarlane . " Bud " McFarlane is a strange , indrawn , moody former Marine lieutenant colonel who had worked around the fringes of the security field , and had been part of Henry Kissinger 's staff some years before . He had also worked in the State Department under Alexander Haig . <p> McFarlane is a man of evident limitations . He could not hide them , but he did attempt to do so by means of an enigmatic manner , featuring heavily measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a great desire to be perceived as " better than Henry "  --  a difficult task at best . It was in pursuit of that vague agenda , I am convinced , that McFarlane , who was almost totally staff-driven , allowed some enthusiastic staff members of equally little judgment to put forth a number of proposals of their own , when they should have been giving the President the opportunity to review the different options in the whole , complex field of foreign policy and national security . <p> One of the first of his staffs ideas was that we should encourage Egypt , by offering it " several " ( McFarlane was never sure quite how many ) American supporting divisions , to invade Libya . Also , on one of his earlier trips to Lebanon as the special Lebanon negotiator , he warned Washington that " Beirut was about to fall , " because he experienced one of the more or less normal shellings of that capital of anarchism . He demanded that we commit more troops and military resources , presumably to " save " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as it could go , that McFarlane cable became known among the military as " McFarlane 's ' sky is falling ' cable . " <p> EARLY IN 1984 , members of the National Security Council staff were becoming concerned about what might happen in Iran after Khomeini 's death . On August 31 , 1984 , McFarlane formally requested " an interagency analysis of American relations with Iran after Khomeini . " Completed in October of that year , this study correctly reported that the United States could do little to establish any influential contacts within the Iranian government in view of the kind of people that led Iran . <p> The NSC staff members and Mr. McFarlane did not accept that conclusion . It is the habit of government officials with their own agendas that if they do not get the answer they want on the first try , they try again . In this instance they took the tack of " updating , " paraphrasing , and rephrasing intelligence estimates for the President , to demonstrate that the Soviet Union  --  but not the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might develop in Iran . <p> In any event , on June 17 , 1985 , McFarlane transmitted a draft National Security Decision Directive ( NSDD ) to Secretary of State George Shultz and to me . A number of well-known points were made about the strategic importance of Iran , and then the NSDD discussed the desirability of opening a " dialogue " and making an effort to re-establish a good working relationship with Teheran  --  even to the extent of giving Iran arms . Here is the key option from that NSDD : <p> Encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance and trade offers , while demonstrating the value of correct relations with the West . This includes provision of selected military equipment as determined on a case-by-case basis . <p> ( The irony here is that McFarlane and his associates did not even adhere to the " case-by-case basis " once we began shipping arms . No hostages were returned after the first shipment ; yet the NSC staff plunged ahead despite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hostages came out . ) <p> I felt that this was one of the more absurd proposals yet circulated , and so noted in the margin of my copy , adding that this would be similar to " asking Qaddafi over for a cozy lunch . " In my formal reply , I said : <p> Under no circumstances should we now ease our restrictions on arms sales to Iran . Such a policy reversal would be seen as inexplicably inconsistent by those nations whom we have urged to refrain from such sales , and would likely lead to increased arms sales by them and a possible alteration of the strategic balance in favor of Iran while Khomeini is still the controlling influence . <p> George Shultz also objected : <p> The draft NSDD appears to exaggerate current anti-regime sentiment and Soviet advantages over us in gaining influence . Most importantly , its proposal that we permit or encourage a flow of Western arms to Iran is contrary to our interest both in containing Khomeinism and in ending the excesses of this regime . <p> Nothing more was heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other business , which continued at its normal pace of 16 to 18 hours a day , I paid no further attention to McFarlane 's suggestions that somewhere in the middle of Teheran there was a kinder , gentler Iran . <p> I DID NOT know then ( and I doubt that very many others knew ) that the entire McFarlane initiative had arisen from meetings he had been holding with various representatives of Israel , with whom some Iranians were in close contact . The Israelis were trying to secure American participation in a complex scheme to satisfy Iran 's great need for equipment for its enfeebled military . In return , the Israelis told McFarlane , the Iranians would consider freeing some of the hostages they had kidnapped many months , and in some cases years , before . <p> Israel had long had a running and well-understood feud with Iraq , but it also had a close secret association with Iran . The real consideration to Israel for its help in securing United States arms for Iran was to be protection for both the Israelis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , Iran wanted antitank and anti-aircraft weapons , specifically our TOW and Hawk missile systems , in order to counter Iraq 's superiority in armor and air strength . <p> I learned much later that beginning in January 1985 , and before McFarlane 's efforts to " update " the intelligence estimates concerning Iran , Iranian and Israeli arms dealers had been meeting and discussing whether they could promote either direct arms sales from the United States to Iran or sales from Israel 's substantial stocks of American weapons . <p> In short , McFarlane took the bait and willingly went along with this Israeli-Iranian plot . In early May , he employed a consultant , Michael Ledeen , to meet with Israeli leaders , and in June Israeli government officials met with McFarlane at the White House to talk about a possible " dialogue " between the United States and Iran . <p> McFarlane later " recalled " that he had briefed the President about his meeting with David Kimche , the Israeli representative , but then he also " recalled " briefing Secretary Shultz and me on July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did on many other points . I recall no such meeting . July 13 was the Saturday the President was operated on for abdominal cancer ; I was going over office papers in the garden at our home in McLean , Virginia , and not being briefed by McFarlane . <p> To the best of my knowledge , McFarlane kept these matters as secret as possible , talking only about the possible advantages of a new working relationship with Iran  --  when , that is , he discussed his initiatives at all . In any event , he certainly did not refer to the discussions he had had with Kimche or others in the memorandum he circulated later that summer wherein he argued that we should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran , including " provision of selected military equipment . " <p> As I said before , my memorandum of July 16 , 1985 , objected sharply to the entire proposal , as did the memorandum circulated by Secretary Shultz . <p> Since Secretary Shultz and I heard nothing more about it , we assumed that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Israeli and Iranian arms dealers , including one of the most unreliable and untrustworthy people on the international scene , Manucher Ghorbanifar . <p> The stow gets cloudier thereafter . McFarlane claims he cabled a proposal , on July 14 , 1985 , to Secretary Shultz ( but not to me ) about allowing a hundred of our TOW missiles to go to Iran from Israel , in return for which seven of the Americans held would be released . The Tower Commission report says Shultz replied at first " with a tentative show of interest without commitment . " Knowing George 's thoughts on the matter , I strongly doubt that he exhibited favorable interest . <p> McFarlane later claimed he had met with the President on that proposal at the time . The President could not recall any such meeting . That seems to me entirely reasonable : even if McFarlane did raise this subject , it would have been when Mr. Reagan was in the weakened condition familiar to anyone who has had major surgery . <p> In any case , McFarlane would not let the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House with David Kimche . According to the subsequent investigations , Kimche kept proposing that the hundred TOW missiles should go to Iran , without anything in return , as a means of " establishing good faith . " No one explained why it was so important to show the Iranians good faith , since they had played an important role in the seizure and holding of seven American citizens and other innocent persons of other nationalities . <p> I knew nothing of Kimche 's proposals , but I recall a meeting in the White House on August 6 with the President ( still in his hospital bathrobe ) , Shultz , McFarlane , Don Regan , and either Bill Casey or John McMahon , his deputy . The question of arms deals came up again and again . Secretary Shultz and I argued as forcefully as possible against the whole idea , explaining how it would completely violate our accepted policy of not ransoming hostages . I made the further point that there was nothing to indicate any change in the virulently anti-Western , anti-American attitude of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to explain ourselves to our friends and allies  --  with whom we had been pleading to honor our arms boycott  --  if it were to become known that we were supplying arms to Iran . And by implicating the President in a secret deal , we risked having future Administration policy subjected to the equivalent of blackmail by anyone who knew . It seemed clear to me , although the President did not so state then and there , that he agreed with me . ( I was often asked by reporters during the 1988 presidential campaign , " What was the role of Vice President Bush ? " He was present at some of the meetings I attended , but was called out frequently to take phone calls . He rarely offered the President opinion-based advice in those meetings , preferring , as I understood it , to discuss matters with him when the two were alone . ) <p> Nonetheless , McFarlane apparently advised the Israelis that it was all right for them to sell American weapons to the Iranians , and that we would resupply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hostages out . " Subsequent investigations have made it clear that , in Don Regan 's words , the President was " upset at this news . " McFarlane would later say that the Israelis had " taken it upon themselves to do this . " <p> The President wrote to the Tower Commission that he could recall nothing " whatsoever about whether I approved an Israeli sale in advance , or whether I approved replenishing of Israeli stocks around August of 1985 . My answer therefore , and the simple truth , is , I do n't remember  --  period . ' " I believe the President . He never approved any such plan in my presence , and I do not believe he ever did . <p> On September 15 , 1985 , Reverend Benjamin Weir was released by his captors . I later learned that Israel had delivered 408 TOWs to Iran on September 14 . The release of all the remaining hostages , predicted by McFarlane , of course did not occur ' Nor was any certain connection established between Israel 's delivery of arms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard that American representatives had been involved in Israeli-Iranian discussions was from some puzzling cable traffic reported to me in the course of my normal briefings . When I inquired about the meaning of some oddly phrased messages , I was told by our intelligence agencies that they had made a mistake : they had received instructions not to let me see any of those messages . <p> I had to remind them as forcefully as possible that the National Security Agency is part of the Department of Defense and that no one had the authority to give instructions not to let me see such messages . They replied that their instructions had come from " the White House . " I reminded them that buildings do not give instructions ; that they reported to me ; that henceforth they would report to me all traffic of any kind , as well as any instructions they received not to let me see something ; and , finally , that future attempts to keep us from access to all intelligence would result in a change in the employment status of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding those cables , which I came upon quite by accident , I demanded the meetings that were held by the President in the late fall of 1985  --  long after I thought the entire Iran proposal had been killed . <p> On November 30 , McFarlane resigned . He never made clear why . Most reports said he was " frustrated " and " tired . " I later learned that on that same day Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the NSC staff proposed a new " arms-for-hostages " deal to McFarlane 's successor , Admiral John Poindexter . When this proposal was considered by the President on December 7 , George Shultz and I again opposed the plan in the strongest possible terms . <p> To my unhappiness , Mr. McFarlane ( although he had resigned ) had now decided to go to London to deliver a message to the Iranians , including the notorious Ghorbanifar . George Shultz and I left that December 7 meeting convinced that the trip had been blocked . Indeed , I told Assistant Secretary of Defense Rich Armitage that " the baby McFarlane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But McFarlane , and apparently Admiral Poindexter , decided McFarlane could go . <p> We do not know what McFarlane actually told the Iranians . He " debriefed " some of the December 7 attendees on December 10 , but I always felt that his " debriefings " were imaginary reports on what he wanted direct United States deliveries to Iran in exchange for release of the hostages . <p> WHEN PEOPLE ask how this whole activity could have developed in the face of the opposition of the Secretaries of State and Defense , the answer seems to me simple and most unfortunate . People with hourly access to the President , such as McFarlane , could phrase things in the most favorable terms , report to the President all manner of " hopeful indications , " and generally lead a busy President , occupied with many other things , including preparations for the Geneva meeting with Gorbachev , to believe that " progress " was being made , and that ultimately our hostages would be released . <p> The next step was easy , although very nearly politically fatal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to " overcharge " the Iranians and turn over some of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras , whose funding Congress had sporadically denied . It seemed like a " neat idea " to Ollie North and some other NSC staff members . ( North later testified that Ghorbanifar had made the suggestion in a men 's room in either Frankfurt or London . ) They knew of the President 's strong desire that the Contras be funded , and they regarded their scheme as a way to support the freedom-fighters without troubling about congressional reticence  --  or about the legality of the action  --  and without bothering to tell the President or anyone else about it . I first heard of it on November 21 , 1986 , the fateful day the President dismissed North and Poindexter . <p> The Contras should have been funded , but there is only one way to secure legal spending by our government , and that is by vote of Congress . <p> In any event , on January 7 , 1986 , Secretary Shultz and I again argued against the very idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan was . Nonetheless , the President gave me the impression that he had approved the idea . It was later shown that , either that day or the day before , he had signed a draft " intelligence finding " authorizing the transaction . I never saw the signed draft . <p> After the whole matter was disclosed to the public , I was told that the President had signed a later , revised copy of the order on January 17 . On that day Admiral Poindexter told me that the President had approved an arrangement under which the Department of Defense was to sell four thousand TOWs to the CIA , and the CIA would then transfer them to Iran . Neither Secretary Shultz nor I , nor even Don Regan , saw the final , January 17 finding until it was revealed publicly ; it supposedly authorized the transaction and , in effect , provided for the NSC to be the manager of the whole activity . <p> When I was told that the President had approved the sale , I insisted that any weapons transferred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of the Economy Act . I reminded everyone that direct transfer from the Defense Department to Iran would violate the Arms Export Control Act , and said that I would refuse to allow such a transfer . I must record here that I hoped this added objection would slow down or possibly even stop the sale . <p> Mr. McFarlane continued to be used for " consultation " by the new National Security Advisor . As late as May 15 , 1986 , McFarlane was still planning his " secret mission to Iran , " and this was all carried on without my knowledge . Indeed , on May 17 Colonel North strongly urged Admiral Poindexter to include Secretary Shultz and me in a meeting with the President to review McFarlane 's proposed trip , but the admiral responded in a written memorandum : " I do n't want a meeting with the President , Shultz , and Weinberger . " <p> McFarlane arrived in Iran on May 25 in a plane carrying more Hawk spare parts . Nothing happened with respect to release of the hostages , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from the aircraft . Three more American hostages were kidnapped in September and October of 1986 ; and while Father Lawrence Jenko had been freed in July , it was in no way clear ( contrary to Admiral Poindexter 's claim while briefing the President ) that this had any connection with any of the shadowy figures with whom McFarlane had been dealing . <p> It was during that trip to Iran that U.S. policy attained a depth of absurdity rarely seen . That was when North presented the Iranians with a Bible , saying : <p> We inside our government had an enormous debate , a very angry debate inside our government over whether or not my President should authorize me to say " We accept the Islamic Revolution of Iran as a fact .... " He the President went off one whole weekend and prayed about what the answer should be and he came back ... with that passage I gave you written in the front of the Bible ... And he said to me , " This is a promise that God gave to Abraham . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> In fact , the President had been persuaded to sign the Bible by Admiral Poindexter , who told him it would help him get through to the Iranians . <p> Even worse , McFarlane and/or his staff , without the slightest authority or agreement by the President , gave the Iranians military intelligence concerning Iraqi defensive dispositions at the exact time when it was becoming increasingly clear that we should be tilting toward Iraq rather than doing anything to support the barbaric and fanatical government of Iran . Some of that intelligence was deadly accurate , and helped the Iranians inflict additional losses on Iraq . <p> On November 2 , 1986 , another hostage , David Jacobsen , was released . On November 3 , the stow of the McFarlane mission came out in a pro-Syrian magazine in Beirut , and on November 4 , the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament , Hashemi Rafsanjani ( the same Rafsanjani who was frequently cited by McFarlane as " friendly to the U.S. " and an Iranian " moderate " ) , publicly acknowledged and denounced the mission , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> THE NEAR-TRAGIC result of the entire affair was that , for the first time , a sizable majority of the public lost faith in the President and said they did not believe his explanations . It took many months , indeed over a year , for the public to regain its confidence in the President . <p> The President was characteristically selfless and exhibited great political and personal courage in admitting publicly that he had made a mistake . He agreed that it was not possible to negotiate or do business with the Iranians , and that the advice he had been given by McFarlane and others was not only wrong but dangerously wrong . I think that the President , because of his innate loyalty toward people who worked with him , was far milder in his statements than he actually felt . <p> In the end , however , the President fortunately emerged from this whole episode undiminished after an extremely unhappy period of seven months . He regained the trust and faith that the American people had always had in him , and he finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been . America again is in a position in which we have achieved and earned substantial respect from our allies , our friends , and our opponents . It is in many ways the most remarkable tribute of all those rightly accorded Mr. Reagan that the American people in overwhelming numbers kept such deep respect and affection for him . And it is a happy thing for America that he served as our President for eight critical years . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By CASPAR W.
