<p> WITH LOCAL interest keen over Henri-Georges Clouzot 's 1953 French classic " The Wages of Fear " ( the uncut version closes today at the Castro Theater ) , the Roxie Cinema is bringing back the 1977 epic adventure that some have called the American remake : William Friedkin 's " Sorcerer . " <p> It will have four showings Wednesday : at 2 , 4:30 , 7 and 9:45 p.m . Friedkin will appear in person after the 7 p.m. screening to take questions from the audience . <p> The first person who disagrees that this film is a remake is Friedkin , who is best known as the director of two major blockbusters : " The French Connection " ( 1971 ) and " The Exorcist " ( 1973 ) . His most recent work was " The Guardian , " a horror film released in 1990 . <p> In the Bay Area recently , editing his new film " Rampage , " Friedkin was more than enthusiastic on the subject of " Sorcerer . " Even though it was a box-office flop when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never earned a penny of profit , it remains his personal favorite . <p> " I 've always been struck by the power and suspense of Clouzot 's work , but I never had the idea to do a remake , " he said emphatically . " I did n't want to repeat the same incidents and characters of the original , I wanted everything in ' Sorcerer ' to be unique . But I did want to take the theme of ' Wages of Fear ' and do my variation on it . <p> " I saw it as a perfect metaphor for the world situation today . Four total strangers , resentful and fearful of each other , must put aside their differences and work together to save their lives . And that 's our world today : It 's full of foreigners who hate each other but they must cooperate or die . " <p> " Sorcerer " and " The Wages of Fear " are both about fugitives from justice who meet up in a run- down South American village and accept jobs driving trucks filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " creates characters of its own mold and has a structure that is drastically different from Clouzot 's film . While " Wages " opens in the squalid village where the four main characters already have drifted , " Sorcerer " spends most of its first hour establishing the original milieus of the men . Roy Scheider is an American gangster pulling off a New Jersey heist ; Francisco Rabal is an assassin performing a hit in Vera Cruz ; Bruno Cremer is a French embezzler trying to cover up his theft in Paris ; Amidou is a Palestinian terrorist planting a bomb in a teeming city street . All must flee for their lives when the heat is turned up . <p> While " Wages " deals with the changing personalities of the men as they make their dangerous jungle trek , establishing an existentialist attitude through dialogue , " Sorcerer " is less articulate and more visually realistic in showing , in almost microscopic detail , the harrowing experiences of the truckers as they sweat it out against overwhelming odds . <p> " I 'm a fatalist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , " Friedkin said . " You can plan your life but one day you walk outside and get hit by a truck , or a refrigerator falls on your head . It happens to all of us to one extent or another . ' Sorcerer ' is about how fate alters men 's lives . " <p> And Fate , Friedkin insisted , " took a hand in the making of ' Sorcerer . ' This picture was not meant to be made . It was a production ordeal from beginning to end . " <p> One spectacular sequence has the truck ( dubbed Sorcerer , hence the film 's title ) crossing a rickety suspension bridge over a rampant river in a blinding rainstorm . This hazardous event runs at least 10 minutes and is an exhausting experience for the viewer with one cliff-hanger heaped on another . <p> It took Friedkin and his crew  --  including production designer John Box and his assistant Roy Walker  --  three months to complete this sequence . It also took the efforts of two cinematographers : John M. Stephens and Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic we could n't use because the river went dry for the first time in recorded history , " Friedkin recalled . " We found our second river in Oaxaca , Mexico , and even that went down from 12 to three feet while we shot . We did n't use any miniaturizations  --  everything was shot on an actual suspension bridge with hidden metallic supports that were hydraulically controlled , so we could raise and lower portions of the bridge at will . We had to lash the truck down so it would n't topple off . " <p> Since a gray background sky was needed , filming could be done only for short periods before sunup and after sundown . To simulate the storm , Friedkin needed huge hoses to shoot water into the air , drawn from the river below . <p> Disease , accident , illness , flood , drought  --  all took their toll on the cast and crew . Even Friedkin was felled by malaria . Another problem was Friedkin 's reputation , which had preceded him . Indian natives were needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had directed " The Exorcist , " the natives bolted . " There was a mass exodus from the area . They split by the hundreds . " <p> Why did the film flop at the box office ? It was produced by Universal and Paramount ( one of the first co-studio films of its kind ) with no expense spared . Friedkin estimates the budget at $ 15 million ( " a lot of money for its time " ) , and it was given a major release . Some have suggested that the title was misleading . Coming from the director of " The Exorcist , " it appeared to be another supernatural thriller , but was n't . <p> There 's another possibility for the public 's apathy : Because there are no sympathetic characters ( unlike the Clouzot film , which has Yves Montand as a charming rogue ) , " Sorcerer " creates a chasm that viewers find difficult or impossible to breach . <p> Friedkin is the first to admit his film " just never caught on , and I 'm not sure why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The film was my vision , and most of what I 'd envisioned is up there on the screen . " <p> He also acknowledged that Scheider , though a " superb actor , " was not the " big star " that the film needed . Walon Green , the writer whom Friedkin had worked with in shaping the story for " Sorcerer , " originally had written the gangster part for Steve McQueen . <p> " AT the time , McQueen had just married Ali MacGraw and did n't want to go off into the jungle unless he could take her with him , " Friedkin recalled . " That meant I 'd have had to write a role for her or make her an associate producer . I was arrogant in those days and I said , ' Who needs Steve McQueen ? ' If I was confronted with the decision today , I 'd be less arrogant and find a way to work in Ali . " <p> Friedkin said that " The Wages of Fear " was " a great movie . It never fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the pleasure of meeting Clouzot before his death  --  he turned out to be a soft , vulnerable man , not the hard a- - he 'd been painted to be . I 'd intended to negotiate the rights for ' Wages of Fear ' so he could share in the profits , only to discover Clouzot did n't own the rights and had never made any residuals from his movie , even though it was still playing the world over after more than 20 years . " <p> ACCORDING to Friedkin , the rights to the novel were still owned in the 1970s by the writer , Georges Arnaud . " Clouzot told me that Arnaud hated him and had never liked the film version of ' Wages of Fear , ' although why Clouzot never told me . " <p> Friedkin 's next film , " Rampage , " will be released this spring by Miramax after being caught up in legal problems for 4 1/2 years after the collapse of the Dino De Laurentiis producing empire . He called the film " a radical tirade against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an insidious degree , are now telling the courts and education system in this country how to make their decisions . " <p> Despite the onetime popularity of " The French Connection " and " The Exorcist , " the following for " Sorcerer " continues to bring Friedkin his greatest recognition on college and university campuses . " Very definitely , " he said , " it 's a cult film . " It is now available in excellent laser disc and videocassette versions from MCA that were overseen by Friedkin himself .
