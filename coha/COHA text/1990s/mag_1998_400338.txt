Rethinking Food , Fun and Fleas for Fido and Fifi // Americans share their homes with more than 112 million cats and dogs , not to mention an assortment of reptiles , birds , horses and exotic animals . As pet owners become more health- and environment-conscious , they 're starting to apply their lifestyles to their companion animals . In 1996 , U.S. pet owners supported the natural pet food and supplement industry to the tune of $65 million , and sales keep climbing . But what is natural pet care ? Holistic veterinarians say it all begins with a nonprocessed , whole foods diet . According to the Animal Protection Institute ( API ) , commercial pet foods , from Friskies to Kal-Kan , contain mostly grain wastes and meat by-products , which can include everything from euthanized shelter animals to cancer-ridden livestock , roadkill , downer animals , moldy grains and rancid restaurant grease . Federal meat inspector and veterinarian P.F. McGargle notes that feeding these low-in-nutrition packaged " scraps to pets increases their chances of cancer and other degenerative diseases .

An API investigative report found that in slaughterhouses , " whatever remains of the carcass after choice cuts for human food have been removed-bones , blood , pus , intestines , bowels , ligaments , fat , hooves , horns and beaks " - are what find their way into the pet food stream . Why is this unhealthy practice so popular ? Profits . Many pet food companies are branches of human food conglomerates that want to turn waste products from one sector into sales for another . Ralston-Purina , for example , gets the scraps from Heinz , Nestle and Mars to produce its pet foods . So what options do pet owners have ? Holistic veterinarian Dr. Will Winter says , " Dogs and cats were designed to handle raw , uncooked foods . " He recommends mixing fresh cuts of meat ( not ground ) with whole grains and vegetables for a balanced diet . Several companies , like Minnesota-based Sojourner Farms , sell pet food mixes containing nuts , herbs and grains which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also join the feeding dish , but should always be cooked to eliminate parasites .

From shampoos and dips to foggers and collars , conventional flea controls caution consumers to use gloves , and keep product away from skin and mucous membranes . Yet they 're being applied all over your pet , where the toxic emissions from a flea collar or spray , for instance , are being constantly inhaled or licked by the wearer . The Cancer Prevention Coalition has warned against the use of several brandname flea collars , including Sergeant 's , Hartz , Zodiac and Longlife . Conventional foggers , bombs , powders and sprays are just as problematic , and should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk of neurological problems and leukemia , and could include the nerve poisons dichlorvos , propoxur or diazinon , and many " inert " ingredients like methyl bromide , benzene , asbestos and DDT .

Herbal shampoos , collars , sachets and sprays using citronella , eucalyptus , pennyroyal , tea tree oil and other aromatic oils to repel fleas and ticks are other less-toxic options , and are available from natural pet care companies like BioChemics ( Bug Out spray ) , and One Earth ( herbal collars and Citrus Shampoo Plus ) .
