IF CATHERINE OF ARAGON had had access to television , the Church of England might never have been created . Even without the media , however , Princess Diana might have been more than a match for old King Henry . In last week 's frank one-hour interview on the bbc , she delivered as penetrating a kick to the crown jewels as any woman in history . It 's not simply that the estranged wife of a future King appeared poised , gentle and articulate ( albeit she said albeit five times in half an hour ) ; it 's not that she failed to come off as the loony blue-blood bimbo her detractors have made her out to be . What was shocking was that she did an interview at all , telling neither her mother-in-law nor her own press secretary until it was in the can . She 's playing by her own rules . <P> In fact Diana revealed little to viewers in Britain ( and subsequently 37 other countries ) that was new . But the confirmation of what was rumored  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on Jenny Jones  --  was a bit of a bombshell coming from a member of the royal family . Yes , she knew her husband was making nasty with Camilla Parker Bowles in 1986 , thanks to " woman 's instinct " and " people who cared about our marriage . " Yes , this worsened her bulimia and self-abuse . Yes , she hurt her own arms and legs . And yes , she had her own affair , with James Hewitt , her riding instructor . But no , she did n't make all those calls to a London art dealer ; a " young boy " did it ( right after he ate her homework ) . <P> The more important revelations were implicit . After 15 years in the white-hot limelight , Diana 's perfect p.r . pitch has become her best weapon . From the melancholy kohl-rimmed eyes to the hesitant body language , from the lack of spite ( she 'll take " half " the responsibility for the split ) to the deference to the Prince ( " I await my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part with great cunning , showing that when she says she wo n't go easily , she means it . <P> And in the short term at least , the score seems to be Diana 1 , Palace 0 . Post-show polls indicated that more than 80% of British viewers were favorably impressed . So much so , perhaps , that the Windsors raised a white flag : senior royal aides said they would discuss with Diana " how we can help her define her future role and continue to support her as a member of the royal family . " <P> Why did she do it ? Her pat answer  --  to " reassure all those people that have loved me and supported me ... that I 'd never let them down . This is a priority , along with my children "  --  may contain some truth . Diana , who admits she probably wo n't be Queen , may be maneuvering to promote young Prince William and protect her access to him . Since no one likes to see a devoted parent denied her children , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future King . As for her desire to be " queen of people 's hearts , " it looks as if she already is . <P>  --  Reported by Helen Gibson/London
