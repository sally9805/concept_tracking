The four rooms in a dormitory at the University of Southern California look like the field office of a political campaign . The hallway is cluttered with ( stacks of paper . Phones ring incessantly . Earnest young workers scurry from room to room . <P> A campaign it is , but an educational , not a political , one . This is the western headquarters of Teach for America , a radical attempt to woo promising graduates of the nation 's top colleges into teaching . Whirlwind Wendy Kopp conceived the idea when she was an undergraduate at Princeton . She developed it in her senior thesis and , since her graduation in 1989 , has pursued it with obsessive zeal , organizing recruiters at 100 campuses and raising $2 million in corporate and foundation gifts . The basic notion is that non-education majors , after a crash course of training , will serve two-year stints as teachers in U.S. public schools in a sort of domestic education equivalent of the Peace Corps . <P> Last week TFA 's 505 trainees , selected from more than 2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom . Under the eye of veteran teachers , they began working with students in 65 Los Angeles schools . The classroom sessions are part of a grueling eight-week training institute , based on the U.S.C. campus , that includes instruction in teaching techniques and workshops on decision making . <P> " It 's overwhelming , " says Lisa Robinson , 22 , who graduated in June from Columbia University . " This is the first time in my life that what I do  --  actually molding kids ' views  --  could have negative repercussions for years . " For others , there have been frustrating surprises . " I could n't believe that on my first day some kid was winking at me ! " says Vanderbilt graduate Melissa Menotti , 21 , who taught algebra to tenth- and eleventh- graders . <P> When the TFA recruits ' training ends in August , 233 of them will remain in Los Angeles . The rest will take positions in New York City , New Orleans , Baton Rouge , La. , and rural districts in North Carolina and Georgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an education degree . TFA participants will receive salaries from $18,000 to $29,000 and be allowed to defer any federal student-loan repayments until the end of service . <P> Many educators hope that TFA 's unorthodox approach will boost the low status of the profession and help alleviate the growing teacher shortage . According to the American Federation of Teachers , U.S. schools will have to hire 1.8 million new teachers by 1997 . The need is especially acute in inner cities and rural communities , precisely the areas TFA serves . " Without programs like ! this , " says New York City Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez , " we are never going to resolve pipeline issues related to attracting the very best and brightest to our profession . " <P> But some traditionally trained teachers are highly critical of TFA . " They are probably good people , " says Jaime Escalante , the East Los Angeles calculus teacher who served as the inspiration for the movie Stand and Deliver . " But the time ( ( for training ) ) is not enough . " Some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most teachers remain unheralded . " It 's because the profession is starved for recognition , " explains Sandra Feldman , president of New York City 's United Federation of Teachers , which supports TFA.
