With the oldest continuous wine-making tradition in the America 's , Chile is now employing modern techniques to cultivate a vigorous industry <p> FOR CENTURIES , POETS and painters have watched and recorded the sea from the hills overlooking the Chilean port of Valparaiso . Today this romantic city is bursting with the pressures of growth . Containers of copper goods , fresh fruit , timber and wine , made from some of the world 's finest grapes , are stacked high awaiting shipment to all corners of the globe . <p> The Chilean wine industry developed in the 1860 's under the influence of the local aristocracy . Basque/French landed families of Chile , whose fortunes were built on mining coal and metals , wintered in Paris and brought Bordelais winemakers back with them on their return . Parks were designed by French landscape architects , creating tranquil estates surrounded by vineyards of cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc , the staples of red and white Bordeaux wines . <p> But by the end of the century , most vineyards in Bordeaux , and the rest of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been imported to France on North American vines , and quickly ravaged the roots of European vineyards . To combat the louse , vineyards around the world were planted on resistant , native North American rootstock , with vines grafted on top . Chile , remote and protected from phylloxera infestation by the narrow con fines of the Andes to the East , the Pacific Ocean to the West and by a vast desert in the North , is the only wine region today where the original vine clones of nineteenth century Bordeaux still prosper on vitis vinifera rootstock , without the need for grafting . <p> That piece of trivia amounts to tremendous cost savings in propagating vines and planting new vineyards . In North America , the savings would be about $2 on each $3 nursery grafted plant , or about $5000 a hectare . And because the vines are from the old Bordeaux clones , they produce grapes with a slightly different flavor than what is found elsewhere in the world . Ungrafted vines , a consistently benign climate , proximity to cooling ocean breezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined to focus international attention on Chilean wine . <p> Foreign investment in the Chilean wine business is now driving the pace of change to an unprecedented level . On a recent trip to taste and explore the potential of Chile 's wine industry , the work of four leaders stood out . The wines of these producers have undergone revolutionary change in each vintage tasted since 1987 , and each of them promises even greater development during the next five years . <p> The pace of this change shows a willingness to create wines from Chilean soil for the world market , rather than holding fast to a traditional or national taste . Although Chile has a large middle class which could afford premium wines , consumer tastes here have not yet caught up with the revolution in viticulture . More and more wine sold locally is marketed in tetra-packs , little aluminum and plastic boxes  --  glass bottles here represent one quarter of the cost of most wine on supermarket shelves . The highest quality wine is mostly produced for export , since there is limited demand for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chile 's wine leaders began along the Aconcagua River . Flying into Santiago , the great peak to the northeast is Aconcagua , which sends its ice melt through a gigantic gorge to the Pacific Ocean . The river valley of the same name is an agricultural center , ringed by the coastal range to the west and the Andes to the east . Panquehue is a tiny settlement in the valley . The name of this village incorporates the Mapuche Indian word for place , " hue " , which appears at the end of town names throughout Chile with the regularity of ville or - ton in North America . <p> Errazuriz Panquehue is an old estate of the town . The family name , Errazuriz , is Basque ; the young proprietor , Eduardo Chadwick Claro , adds a British element to the Basque/Spanish/ Mapuche melange . Now Chadwick is working with Agustin Huneeus , of California 's Franciscan Estate Selections , and his German backers , the Eckes family , all of whom greeted us on our arrival : an international conference in the Aconcagua Valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique perspective on the developments in Chile . " Wine culture dropped off during a generation of political problems , and has not been quality oriented until recently , " Huneeus began as we descended to the aging cellars where slats of old casks were stacked and bound , replaced by new oak barriques from France and Kentucky . " Prior to the last five years , wood had not been imported into Chile for 50 or 60 years . Now we 're seeing a new approach to wine . We 're stopping irrigation three or four months before the harvest ; the wood situation is improving ; and we 're incorporating temperature controlled stainless steel for white wine production at our new facility in Curico . In the next several harvests , when the vineyards have been changed by new management practices , there will be major changes in the wines . What we 've learned to do in the Napa Valley over a long period of time , we 're incorporating here in four years . " <p> The Don Maximiano Vineyard , surrounding the small white adobe winery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cabernet . The joint venture with Franciscans also involves the development of a new brand , Caliterra , named for calicanto , a mixture of lime , egg white and straw which , along with bricks , forms the adobe walls of the aging cellars in Chile . Caliterra 's grapes come from sources around Santiago and further south , in the valleys of Curico and Lontue . <p> For chardonnay , Huneeus predicts that once the initial rush to bring inexpensive chardonnay to the market has passed , the leaders in Chile will start looking far south . A better climate for chardonnay may be found in Mulchen , a cooler region now dry farmed in mission grapes . " Chardonnay has no tradition in Chile , " Huneeus explained . " Chile was exclusively developed by the Bordelais . We are not yet oriented as to where chardonnay will grow best . I am one hundred percent sure that there are undiscovered regions of Chile , that twenty years from now , we will have a completely different Ampelographic map . After all , the old families here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for the weekend . " <p> As we followed Chadwick outside through the vine rows , the wiry thirty-one-year-old pointed out how thick the vegetation was so early in the growing season . " We cut our yields tremendously in one year , and made a much more concentrated wine . " The North American partner took the lead , explaining , " The key here is vigor . Like California , we have over-vigorous agriculture . Replanting more densely will take twenty years to have an effect ; cutting down on water will have an immediate impact . " <p> By lowering the yield and controlling the vigor of the vines , the flavor of the grapes is richer and more concentrated . Processing this intensely flavored fruit in new stainless steel tanks , and aging it in carefully selected imported oak barrels has a dramatic effect on the finished wine . Normally , the use of new technology and equipment results in a standard , well-made wine . However , because of Chile 's superior viticulture , the changes in production are having a much more significant impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Errazuriz Panquehue only produces 80,000 cases a year making it a very different model from Concha y Toro , the largest wine producer in Chile , with headquarters south of Santiago in Pirque , on the Maipo River . Here , Rafael Guilisasti , from another important Basque family in Chile 's wine industry , has staked his own claim to leadership in the future of quality wine exports . This is no small feat , since in Chile , fathers rarely pass control to their sons until they die . Rafael clearly has the benediction of his father and the power within Concha y Toro , enabling him to move this giant company forward on the frontlines of quality , a trick few old line California firms have been able to accomplish . <p> In early 1990 , Rafael introduced his new Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon . The 1987 Don Melchor is the first " new " cabernet export markets will see from Chile . It does not have the smooth richness and concentration of its younger brother , the 1988 , but it has some of the finesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate with this country 's premium bottlings . The wine is selected in the winery after fermentation , from fruit grown in the firm 's best cabernet vineyard , across the Maipo River in Puente Alto . Tasted alongside Concha y Toro 's Marques de Casa Concha , a wine from the same vineyard , it is clear that careful selection can make a marked difference in the finished wine . The Don Melchor is aged in French oak , while the less expensive Marques de Casa Concha is stored in rauli , a native hardwood used pervasively in the Chilean wine industry . <p> In 1989 , Puente Alto was the last cabernet vineyard to be harvested in Chile , and the intensity and ripeness shows in the wine . Rafael is not as forthcoming as some of the other innovators about how Concha y Toro may be changing their viticultural techniques , but there is a clear progression in density of flavor from the 1987 through the 1989 . All three vintages are worthy of attention . At $11-12 in the U.S. , Concha y Toro has released their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than their neighbor to the south , Santa Rita . The strategy is a clear indication of who 's in charge . At Concha y Toro , Rafael gathers his winemakers and enologist Goetz von Gersdorff around him like Napoleon and his generals . Goetz has latitude to experiment , delighting in cool climate research with whites from Casablanca by the sea and Mulchen to the south , but clearly Rafael 's vision is driving the company forward . <p> Santa Rita , in Buin , is also a giant in terms of production , and , like Concha y Toro , most of its production is in less expensive wine for the domestic market . Its ownership is controlled by Ricardo Claro , one of the wealthiest and most powerful industrialists in the country . But the real force at Santa Rita had until recently been winemaker Ignacio Recabarren , whose personal strength is like an electric current . His goal has been to produce wines at the highest international levels of quality . <p> Lithe as a predatory feline , Recabarren had been guarding his experimental , top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . His recent departure from Santa Rita has provided the opportunity for Klaus Schroeder Baasch to take over as enologist , and , as of this writing , the special reserve wine from Santa Rita has yet to be released . <p> Before leaving , Recabarren had planned extensively for the future of viticulture at Santa Rita . Cabernet vineyards have been reconfigured , the vines trained low to the ground on a double guyot trellis . According to Recabarren , " In the last three years , we have been planting vineyards at 4000-6000 vines per hectare to get greater concentration in the wine . There is a difference in the wine if you have the same yield , 4-5 tons per hectare , when there are 3000 vines per hectare as opposed to 6000 vines . We 're cutting down our yields , even as we increase the density of our vines . " This recalls Huneeus ' remarks about vigor . Denser plantings force the vines to compete with each other , leaving less opportunity to grow excessive vegetation . Competitive plants tend to focus energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita 's secret weapon is an unnamed reserve wine from 1987 . Recabarren explained that the wine was selected in the vineyard . " I selected by the vines , the grapes that have the exact combination of pH , total acidity , and degree of sugar on that day . Then I took the wine through extended skin contact for 50 days ; then into barriques for 550 days . " <p> The initial aromatic impression of this 1987 is of beeswax , the seductive quality in certain young classified growths of Bordeaux ' Medoc . The tightly structured wine gives every indication it should age well , though no one has the experience to know how a Chilean wine made under these processes will develop over time . Rodrigo Buzeta , Santa Rita 's export manager , estimated that the wine will sell for $17 ( U.S. ) upon release . Anyone willing to risk fashion for taste will likely find in this wine all the elements of a fine and powerful Bordeaux , without the price of hype . <p> Which leads to the final destination of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the tiny village of Peralillo . There Jorge Eyzaguirre and his wife Maria Ignacia Echenique own a vineyard of 2000 hectares , in which they recently sold a 50% interest to Eric Rothschild of Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux . <p> Jorge Eyzaguirre related the story of his deal with Lafite over breakfast . Another powerful Basque in the Chilean wine business , Eyzaguirre is solidly built , with a square face and deep-set eyes that lit up as he talked of his first break at VinExpo ' 87 in Bordeaux . <p> " On the last day of the fair , the newspaper of Bordeaux published an article comparing our wines with the Medoc of ' 82 . We received a lot of people from the great wineries that day . They came to our stand because of the article , and I found that there was an interest in France to help me with our wines here . <p> " When I got back , I sent the article to a friend in London who worked with Rothschild . I asked him if Eric would have any interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit in December . He said , ' Eric has the papers and he did not say no . ' <p> " He came with a video-recorder , and spent the whole day with the camera . After the visit , I received a letter from Eric , who said he thought we could do business ' one way or another . ' " <p> After visits from enologists , tastings of other Chilean wines , and their assessment that Los Vascos could be No. 1 in Chile , Eric Rothschild came to Los Vascos in September of 1988 . <p> " We had a serious meeting . ' Well , Jorge , ' he said , ' all the information is good . But I must be able to live with my partner . I must know how he thinks , how he lives , because I want to make a 200 year deal , not a 90 day deal . ' We signed in November . " <p> The winery started on the sixth of January and was ready to harvest the reds in March . The 1989 harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to temperature controlled stainless steel tanks , and a new way of picking the grapes . Gilbert Rokvam , Rothschild 's enologist , spent two months overseeing the harvest and winemaking . In the past , because there was not sufficient capacity to take in all the wine at once , Eyzaguirre 's cabernet harvest lasted forty days . In 1989 , the cabernet was picked selectively , according to the ripeness of the grapes , over a period of fifteen days . " In 1988 , we started with high acidity and finished with low . In 1989 , the acidity was the same . " <p> The wine was then aged in barriques from the cellars of Lafite and Cos d'Estournel . Rokvam believes that Chilean fruit can not take too much new oak , so at Los Vascos they are experimenting with wood of various ages . As we approached the winery ; old casks of rauli which Jorge hopes to sell to another winery were lined up outside the building to make room for the new barriques coming in from Bordeaux . Entering the winery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of construction had slowed to a calmer pace . <p> Tasting cabernets with Eyzaguirre , the family resemblance of all the vintages is apparent , Although the radical changes brought in by Lafite have dramatically increased the quality of the ' 89 vintage when compared to earlier bottlings , there remains a distinctive character in all the Los Vascos Cabernets , This is the taste of the soil in Caneten , the specific and consistent flavor that defines a chateau bottled wine . <p> Eyzaguirre explained that only Los Vascos and Cousino Macul have the potential to create completely estate bottled wines in Chile . Cousino Macul 's estate is in Santiago itself . While the industry changed radically in the late ' 80s , the estate was governed under the conservative patriarchy of Don Arturo . Most Chileans agree that the potential for greatness exists at Cousino , and the wines have individuality and elegance . During 1990 , with a new ; gentle pneumatic press installed , Cousino 's white wines have dramatically improved . Young Arturo , the export manager , and his father Carlos Cousino are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments in Chile . <p> At Los Vascos , Eyzaguirre has handed over complete winemaking control to Lafite , and is confident in the outcome . After years of building a small empire in this valley , he seems to view the joint venture as his greatest accomplishment rather than any admission that he could not make it on his own . Certainly , this is how it is perceived by marly of his competitors . On the day of our visit , as we returned to the house past vineyard workers in huaso hats and donkey carts stirring the road dust , we were greeted by the team from Panquehue  --  Chadwick , Huneeus and their German friends . They had come to inspect the winery and vineyards , to see for themselves how the vines were being retrained , the density of planting , the million liters of stainless steel , and , of course , Eyzaguirre 's famed rose garden . <p> Shaking hands all around , there was a sense of comraderie among vineyard owners . Jorge raised a glass to toast the future . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's only a matter of time before we begin to think of Chile in a new light .
