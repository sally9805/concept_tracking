FOUR TIBETAN MONKS <p> work patiently around an ornate circle of colored sand they are gradually forming on an elevated platform in the Los Angeles Natural History Museum . They are small men , and though they are not young there is something youthful about their faces . Each of them looks as if he 's remembering the punch line to a joke he heard earlier in the day , a very funny joke . <p> It would be hard to guess how old the monks are . Three of them have close-cropped black hair . The fourth is totally bald , not even any eyebrows , and has ears like the handle of a jug . <p> In their bright orange robes the monks meticulously sift tiny amounts of fine-crushed limestone onto the platform , then mold and paint it into patterns on an intricate circle seven feet wide . They are creating a mandala , a patterned , circular symbol that represents the wholeness of nature and the universe . When it is finished , this mandala will represent the Kalachakra - the Wheel of Time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barricade here in the Mammal Hall of the museum . The Kalachakra demonstration was delayed a week because of a mild earthquake centered in Sylmar that caused minor damage even to stilt houses high up in the Hollywood Hills . But now the museum has been inspected and declared safe , and the monks and their ceremony have been the Thing to See this month . <p> The monks do n't ignore the crowd ; instead , they seem to regard it as part of their work , stopping every once in a while to point at someone and nod and grin and point at the illuminations and fine-lined designs and whorls taking shape on the platform . <p> For its part , the crowd finds the monks themselves as fascinating as the mandala . The small Tibetan men seem to take great delight in their work . Though precise and particular , they smile constantly , and even when they do n't they look like children acting serious in the midst of some joyous game . <p> A museum guide standing beside the platform tells the crowd that these monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India , are beginning a demonstration of a 2,500-year-old religious ceremony of spiritual empowerment and tranquility said to have been originated by Buddha himself in 600 B.c . <p> " Every morning , " he tells the spectators , " these men start work on the Kalachakra by saying a prayer of purification to the spirits they believe live inside the mandala . They believe that these deities are constantly beckoning them to finish it . " <p> Orange robes rustle , colored sand sifts . <p> Tibet , the guide says , is now a part of China , and the monks are forbidden to practice this ceremony in the country of their birth . They 're touring the United States to demonstrate their beloved ritual and show what their art is like , and to provide unfamiliar Westerners with a sense of their philosophy and how they apply it through their daily lives . <p> A man wearing shorts and thongs and a Cartier watch asks how long will it take to finish the whatchamacallit , the Wheel ? <p> " Six weeks , " says the guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . <p> " What will they do with it when they 're done ? " a woman asks . " It looks like it 's going to be beautiful when it 's finished . Will it go into the museum ? " <p> The guide smiles . " No , ma'am . It 'll go into the ocean . " He even blushes a little as he points to four small whiskbrooms waiting in one corner of the platform . " They keep those here as a reminder . " <p> The woman looks perplexed . " You mean they ... ? " And suddenly horrified . " How awful ! " she says . <p> There 's a kind of nervous , disbelieving laughter . <p> The smiling monks sift the fine-grained limestone , shape it , paint it . <p> Suddenly one of the monks , the jug-eared one , covers his mouth and nose - and turns away from the mandala to sneeze violently : Ba-shooo ! <p> He vigorously wipes his palms on his bright robe and turns back to the delicate sand painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another handful of colored crushed limestone . But he can not resume his work because the other monks are laughing , laughing just as hard as they can . <p> The Creature from the Black Lagoon is liberating lobsters on the ocean floor . A grand gesture , a political action , really . Shame he ca n't just shred their trap and watch them flee , but to be their champion he has to pull them out one at a time and push them away . They drift downward , legs scrabbling nothing until they hit bottom . <p> Half the time they pinch hell out of him . Ingrates . He ought to let them stay in their trap ; they 're really too stupid to be useful as anything but food . But the Creature figures it 's the principle of the thing . <p> The lobster trap is set upon a large concrete container . Inside the container is illegally dumped toxic waste . The Creature knows where there are many more just like it - there are a lot of them up and down the coastline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , military and industrial garbage , munitions , medical refuse , radioactive materials , you name it . There are also tremendous dump fields of slowly corroding metal drums containing toxins , contaminants , pesticides , radioactive garbage . Government and private industry understand the enormous potential of the ocean as a garbage can for things that ca n't be recycled or sold to the Third World . To the Creature , though , the containers are simply convenient landmarks , as they are for the lobster trappers who wonder what 's inside them , but never bother to report their existence . <p> The Creature looks up at a splash from on high . He feels it more than hears it . Wonders who just dropped in . <p> A repatriated lobster clamps onto the Creature 's finger . He shakes it loose and jumps up . Tall buildings in a single bound ? That 's nothing down here . <p> Deirdre Mulligan descends the dune fandango . Her notes and spec reports are stained by her sweaty hand ; a pen is mounted above her ear like a Sidewinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn jeans , a sleeveless T-shirt , and black L.A. Gear sneakers with fluorescent yellow laces . Her exposed skin is slathered with the strongest possible sunblock . <p> She stops near the beach and surveys the area . The sand is flat and shines like slate . Gradient gray in the air , but it 's overcast , not smog . She hopes , anyway . Gulls grate overhead . The waves are powerful tall and loud . Two boys in bright Body Glove bathing suits paddle surfboards out among the troughs . Normally they 'd be wearing wetsuits , but this season the water 's ten degrees warmer than usual . No one knows why . It 's caused some pretty exotic finds , such as South American Humboldt squid and the Tamaria obstipa , a starfish native to coastal waters off Peru . An influx of South American creatures , muses Deirdre . Maybe they brought the weather with ' em . Whatever , the Environmental Impact Report she 's supervising will have to take this into account . <p> Laguna Negra Beach is simply beautiful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beach is smooth and dun , the sand fine and hard-packed . The south end of the crescent that is Laguna Negra is formed by the raw rock of the San Onofre mountain range meeting the waves . The surf here is usually mild - but the surfers like it because the waves break obliquely across half the bay . The obstruction of mountain into breaking waves , however , makes it one of the few points in Southern California where water intermittently slams rock to make huge sprays . To the north is a large wooden pier , the only manmade structure that really intrudes on the beach or into the bay . <p> Standing here , amid the booming surf and the unlittered sand and the spray jetting from the clash of water and rock to the misted south , Deirdre can easily imagine some old , ungainly , top-heavy , square-rigged ship tacking up the coast , for this is one of the few such areas in this region that seem untouched by time . <p> From a real-estate broker 's point of view , this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fairly rare species : Californium indigenous , the native Californian . She was born in Northridge when there were still orange groves there , and educated in several schools as her father , an assistant principal , kept getting transferred in accordance with the lifestyle decree that insists no Southern Californian can remain in one spot longer than three years . After satisfying her carefree adolescent desires for recreational pharmaceuticals ( well , all right : after whetting them ) , Deirdre attended UC San Diego and walked away with a BS in Marine Biology . Then a year of post-grad at Scripps and a certificate in Environmental Sciences from Berkeley . <p> Deirdre could have kept collecting initials after her name , but that seemed too much like hiding to her . Instead she hired out to fledgling environmental watchdog groups for a pittance , limped along on public funding and the occasional government grant , and in general tried to stick by her private agenda . An agenda not for herself but for the world . Despite a wealth of training and scientific terminology at her command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : make the land green again , the oceans blue , the skies clear . <p> Times were tough for idealistic but practical environmental activists . Openings in Deirdre 's field were plentiful - if you wanted to tell multinational conglomerates where to dump their toxic waste , how to store processed uranium , how to present development proposals so that it wo n't look like a thousand acres of arable land were n't being forevermore eradicated . Indications were that someone was about to renege on that nifty-cool and sparkling 21st-Century Techno-Eden Deirdre was promised as she rode the slidewalks through Disneyland . <p> Her job at Eco/Logic , Inc. , is her compromise . There she can conduct honest Environmental Impact Reports , and half the time she can restrict developers who do n't have the environment 's best interests at heart when they set to pillaging . Stopping development is an absurd notion , of course . But at least Deirdre gets to make sure that what gets built does n't mess anything up ( too badly , at least , and what will , does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push into the softer sand above the tide line . It feels like those dreams where you try to run and do n't get anywhere . She has the beach to herself this fine late-summer afternoon . Funny how people flock away from the beach toward sundown . Dark is when she likes the beach best . <p> Seagrapes pop beneath the sole of one shoe . Deirdre thinks of the Portuguese man o ' wars that ride the Gulfstream currents . Innocent little gasbag jellyfish ; they look like little laundry bags . Once , on Florida 's Gulf Coast , she had seen a barefoot boy stomp one , pop , before she could yell for him to stop . His foot had swelled to melon size within minutes . None of that here , she thinks . And if there was anything like that here - anything threatening , anything to reduce the comfort of this spot for human occupation - why , it 'd just have to be removed , now would n't it . To make this Kodak Picture Spot more perfect , more natural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had noticed those signs telling tourists where to take their pictures : Kodak Picture Spot . Grant had told her he imagined a guy with a big semi truck full of those signs , driving across the country looking for picturesque locales . " Grand Canyon ? " Grant had said , and mimed hammering . " Wham-wham-wham . Kodak Picture Spot ! Yellowstone National Park ? Need a couple dozen trucks there . Wham wham wham ! " And Deirdre had laughed at the image of a landscape crowded with vying signs , Kodak Picture Spot signs as far as the eye could see . <p> Only now it does n't seem so funny . <p> Still .... The proposed hundred-million-dollar Laguna Negra Resort will have to meet local , state , and federal clean-water , clean-air , and waste-dumping standards . Not only that , but before any development or construction can begin , it must also satisfy the California Environmental Quality Act - which means it ca n't impair its neighbors ' view or appreciably lower adjoining property values . Land grading and drainage must be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resort must in no way endanger any specialized or rare flora or fauna . <p> Deirdre looks out to the Pacific Ocean where the two boys in bright colors are mounting their surfboards to catch a wave . One boy wears lime green and black trunks , the other neon orange and black . They 're having a great time eavesdropping on the eternal conversation between the ocean and the shore . <p> Deirdre turns back to look at the beach , at the sand and acres of undeveloped land behind it . She sighs . Undeveloped . Like its potential is achingly unrealized . Bring us your yearning , your huddled parcels of land crying out for development . <p> From the north she hears a dull pok ! pok ! pok ! The sound is flattened by the broad beach . Someone 's putting the resort development sign back up . <p> If I could find one thing , she thinks . One thing to keep them from ruining yet another stretch of beach forever . <p> A line from an old song comes to her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the land giving like a woman . She realizes that she does think of the developers as men , and the land as a woman . <p> She laughs humorlessly . But just because it 's a terrible sexual metaphor does n't make it any less true . Or terrible . <p> ELOISE POST FROWNS down at the scarred sign on the dune . Why , this is vandalism . Sheer wanton vandalism . Disrespectful children running around destroying property . Honestly , do n't their parents teach them anything ? <p> She squats to examine the sign . Someone really did a job on it . Looks like they beat it with a crowbar or a claw hammer or something . She 's just going to have to put up a new one . Yep , I went to college so 's I could swing a hammer . You bet . <p> She sighs , thinking about the remainder of her day . She knows she 's mostly puttering around right now , wasting time , putting off having to go to Roger 's to pick up Jennifer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such thoughts , but it 's hard for Eloise to allow herself emotional vacations , however brief . Especially since Laguna Negra Beach itself contains memories for her . Remembrances of her and Roger together in happier times . <p> Frowns come easily to Eloise 's face , as if it had been made ready-tofrown , with prefolded lines at the comers of her mouth and eyes . How many times must you frown to wear a groove in something as soft and pliant as skin ? <p> Eloise looks up from the ruined sign to see the water turning metalbright in the lowing sun . A sun that sets on the beach is still a novelty to her . Studying her face , you wonder at the forces at work in her core that have revealed themselves on the surface , much like continents sliding through the millennia across the skin of the Earth that , with time and pressure , form mountain ridges and plains . What lies in the mantle beneath Eloise 's young-old face to have caused such tectonic erosion ? In the way that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense the passage of glaciers , we can look at the riverbed tridents at the corners of Eloise 's eyes , the sinkhole depression of parentheses bracketing her mouth , and see the Ice Age that was her marriage , the chronic flooding of her Marketing Relations position , the greenhouse effect of her father 's overbearing attention , the firmly buried fossil stratum of her mother 's early death . <p> Eloise surveys the shore . Looks like the beach is mine , she thinks . She squints . No - somebody else down there , near the other side of the bay . Redheaded woman , looks like . <p> Eloise gets a brief , absurd image of herself in a cowboy outfit a'stridin ' toward the stranger on the sand . This beach ai n't big enough for the two of us . It should n't irritate her , but it does . If the shore were crowded it would be one thing , but to almost have it to yourself .... <p> She sighs . Obviously nothing 's going to satisfy her today . <p> She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the shredded resort sign . Pointless vandalism , she thinks again . <p> What 's that , Weezy ? whispers a part of her mind she 'd pay dearly to have amputated . Your marriage ! <p> Eloise 's face gets all pinched-looking . " The sign , " she says out loud , and then feels herself turning red . She glances around . No one to hear her . <p> You let a community know that someone 's come along to beautify the area and up their real-estate values , she thinks , forcing her train of thought onto a different set of rails , and they bash your sign and file petitions to stop you . And the community happily signs the petitions because , after all , you are a developer . <p> The cries of gulls carry over the waves ' crashing . <p> Eloise 's position at Villa Nova Development is one of three in the Marketing Department . Basically , she makes development proposals look attractive and attends meetings and assuages homeowners and tries to argue politely and rationally with 150K young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.L. Bean shirts and spotless Jeep Cherokees to prove it . <p> Now , Eloise is not naive . Villa Nova is n't developing from any altruistic desire for civic improvement . They want money , lots of it , and they spend a lot to make even more . But Eloise thinks of herself as a kind of lawyer : she 's paid to go to bat for the people who are paying her . She does n't have to believe in the company 's aims , as long as she does n't disbelieve them , and as long as she benefits from them . Like any good remora , Eloise is along for the ride . <p> Eloise looks at the papers in her hand : Villa Nova 's resort proposal and Eco/Logic 's prospectus describing the parameters and scope of the Environmental Impact Report . <p> The right to build Laguna Negra Resort is not at all established yetin fact , a clear ownership of the real-estate parcel will not be official until that right is secured . It all hinges on the Environmental Impact Report and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the vandalized resort sign . Here comes the Big Bad Developer . <p> One of Eloise 's duties is to anticipate that EIR for which her company is paying a cool million , and prepare an assessment of her own that preempts it , and , if necessary , negates it . It helps that L.A. County allows developers to hire whoever the hell they want to conduct the EIR , and no law says that they ca n't hire someone else if they do n't like the results . Technically the EIR is a public document , but when completed it will be sent to the lawyer who negotiated the deal between Eco/Logic and Villa Nova , so that it 's protected as a privileged lawyer-client communication . <p> She begins trudging inland . Got to get a new sign out of the car and drag it back here . Wo n't that be fun ? <p> Recent environmental legislation has made the issue of coastal development quite a hot potato , one that gets tossed from committee to committee until it 's hard to figure where it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important body of experts with large important offices in large important government buildings , but basically it 's a dozen overworked , underpaid people in an office without air conditioning in Sacramento , including exactly one field manager for the entire Southland . <p> As she fishes her car keys from her purse ( carrying a purse on the beach ! in tennis shoes and a dress ! in this heat ! Eloise thinks of ways to work this situation in her favor- fully aware that everyone else involved can , too . <p> It 's frustrating enough to make King Solomon take up fingerpainting , and complicated enough to make you wonder that anything ever gets built at all . <p> But things do . Time after time after time . <p> THE CREATURE HEADS toward shore toting a heavy metal drum on his plated back . It 's the drum that made the splash that distracted him while he was liberating the lobsters . Not a diver , just another boat using his living room for a garbage can . <p> If the Creature had n't been environmentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , he might have been inclined to let this invasion slide . But that drum had come barreling down the water to land smack on top of a lobster the Creature had freed not three minutes before . It smashed the lobster flatter than a leper joke and twice as tasteless . It kicked up a smoky cloud of bottom mud like a detonating depth charge , and when it settled the Creature could see the paint-stenciled letters on the side of the drum . HAZARDOUS MATERIALS , it read . <p> The Creature got hopping mad . On the outside , hopping mad for the Creature is pretty mild : he folded his scaled arms and opened his mouth to feel the pulse of the current , and he just stood there , letting lobsters scurry away , ignoring the few that remained in the trap . But inside the Creature was a slow burn . It was your basic core meltdown , where the outside looks fine while the inside collapses and heats up , and nothing shows on the outside until the inside explodes past it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wonders how many drumfuls of hazardous materials you have to have before you need a stencil to label them all . A lot , he figures . Twenty or thirty , maybe as much as a hundred . <p> The Creature does n't like this . <p> Which is why he 's toting that drum back toward shore with the intent to leave it in plain sight for someone to find and properly dispose of on land . If these are their HAZARDOUS MATERIALS , then they should keep them . <p> He leaves the drum in the shallows forty or fifty feet offshore , figuring to let the tide do the rest of the work . The drum will be a lot heavier out of the water , and the Creature just does n't feel like lugging it around . Besides which , these days he 's trying to keep his shoreline appearances to a minimum , and then only at night . It 's starting to get a bit too crowded around here for his taste . He 's cut the sensitive soles of his otherwise armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can remember ; motorboat drones keep him awake in the grotto which he tries to sleep in by day , good goddamn luck ) ; and he 's been hit in the head by surfboards not once , not twice , but three times . <p> The Creature does n't like the thought of leaving , though . The grotto is nice , and he 's invested a lot of time turning it into a place he likes spending time in . Like most of us , the Creature wants little more than to lead his life undisturbed , to keep his head above water , so to speak . <p> He kicks off from the drum and swims shoreward to take a quick look at likely places for the drum to appear . <p> The Creature surfaces . Immediately he feels the sun pressing down on him like a hot fabric . Yowza . His scaly plated skin begins to tighten like drying leather  --  which , in a way , it is . His vision blurs as his eyes dehydrate . He slaps water into and he hates noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pok ! pok ! <p> You just do n't know how much Eloise hates this . Pounding signs into the sand is hardly in her job description . One of the Mexicans hired by Villa Nova should be out here in his pickup truck to take care of this sort of thing . But Smith Webber asked her to do it as long as she was out here , " to keep our presence felt and keep our name in front of those people . " <p> Eloise swings the hammer again , pok ! She hates that sound . It makes her blink . Every time she strikes , she tries to will her eyes from blinking . <p> At her feet are the Resort Proposal and Eco/Logic 's EIR prospectus . <p> Pok ! Eloise blinks . It becomes a matter of proving her will not to blink . <p> She 's probably going to pull a triceps muscle . Eloise is secretly proud to know the names of muscles . She learned them in aerobics classes , which she took up in order to regain her slim figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look appealing again for Roger . Fat lot of good that had done her . Pok ! Get it ? Fat lot of good .... <p> Oh , never mind . <p> Eloise is thinking about how to take the wind out of Eco/Logic 's sails should the EIR turn out unfavorable when a shadow falls across her newly erected sign . <p> The Creature looks from the running woman to the papers lying beside the mallet she dropped on the sand . A spiral-bound report and a stapled sheaf of paper . He bends to pick them up . Yow : bad backs run in his family . Too much time on land causes curvature of the spine . <p> Across the top margin of the notepad is scribbled , Laguna Negra Prelim Assmnt Notes . Wonder what that could mean ? The page is filled with hard-to-read scrawls . The Creature tries to puzzle them out , but it 's no use . He 's been out of the water way too long and his vision 's blurry . It 'll be nice to have something to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel  --  while really good - was getting kind of moldy . <p> Really , though , the ooga booga had been foolish this time out . Whatever that human woman had been , she was no unsuspecting beach type . She was costumed differently , and was obviously perturbed about the sign he 'd destroyed in a fit of pique , because she 'd been putting up a new one . <p> And suddenly the Creature wants to know what this writing in his hand is all about . <p> He 's lost in thought , trying to come up with a way to get these papers back to the grotto <p> - when a shadow falls across the page . <p> Deirdre Mulligan stares in stunned wonder across the corrugated ocean . Lowing sunlight sparks diamond from wave caps . <p> She has just seen a rare and amazing thing . Deirdre Mulligan quivers exalted , sublime , like an Old Testament citizen sharing a drink at a well with an angel . Privileged . She feels an astonishing calm inside . <p> It had n't frightened her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking ; she feels the kind of apprehensive thrill Pasteur must have felt when he held up the petri dish and saw that the bread mold had vanquished the disease . But she is not frightened . <p> The Scientist part of her mind objects . Hoax ! it cries . Piltdown Man ! Hollywood monster movie , decorated diving suit , publicity stunt mirage mass hysteria sunspots ! <p> And as a scientist she responds : the thing had had unseamed joints ; she could see the skeletal motion of ball-in-socket and hinge joints at knee and elbow , see the supportive understructure of ribs , metacarpals , metatarsals , phalanges . And the unidirectional flanging of the gills and cup-shaped spread of hands , the elongated and widened feet , the deltagouge of mouth in a head designed to pivot up and lead the rest of the body - all spoke of a design evolved for horizontal travel underwater . The skin was skin , not latex : textured , iridescent from secretions , patched with algae , draped with seagrape , scaled and plated , flexible and contouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in a costume . It had moved too fluidly , too naturally  --  though not very quickly . It looked too real . <p> And it had gone into the water , and not come back up . <p> No , it was real , a real , living creature . <p> But - what was it ? Where had it come from ? Why had it left no evolutionary record ? <p> " It lives in the water , stupid , " Deirdre says aloud . Ahh . And how much of that fossil record has been played on the turntable of Science ? <p> Top Forty only . <p> And what if its bones are n't bones at all , but cartilage ? Rapid decomposition . no fossilization . Cartilage delende est <p> In the same way a comparative morphologist , a zoologist - any member of a score of sciences - can look at a seal and see a dog that fetched an evolutionary stick fifty million years ago on the Darwinian shore and never returned , can see the horse in the hippo , the elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way , Deirdre looked at the creature and saw a human being that had changed its naturally selective mind however many million years ago and returned to the protean aquatic womb . <p> A dolphin is a distant cousin . This is a brother . <p> And it 's living off her beach . <p> She 's standing in calf-high water with her jeans rolled past her knees . The unusually warm water feels good against her legs . Looking down at the foam sliding past , Deirdre has the sensation that she is moving and the water is stationary-a feeling she remembers from being on the beach as a child . Funny how a sensation , an aroma , a quick play of light , can be a pipeline back to childhood , how all of it can rush back right there in front of you as if no time has passed . <p> And suddenly inside her is a deep rushing echo of that outer sensation . She looks out to sea again , at an imagined place where her creature ( her creature ! ) swims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ace in the hole . <p> Deirdre hoots . Deirdre hollers . She kicks a spray of salt water and digs a trough in the malleable wet sand . <p> Something exposed there gleams green . Some kind of stone ? Deirdre bends , touches its smooth surface . Surf rolls round her legs . She hooks fingers beneath the object and pries it loose , swirls it in the water to wash away the sand . Holds it up to the sun . <p> It 's the most amazing color green . Not jade , not emerald . Its edges are rounded and polished by the lapidary ocean . It is , she realizes , a fragment of a soft-drink bottle . For years it has been softened and burnished by the tides and the sand , until the ocean has turned it into something neither glass nor stone nor jewel . There 's a name for it , what is it ... ? <p> Driftglass . <p> She looks out to sea . And looks at the ethereal green lozenge in her hand . <p> All right , Deirdre-m'darlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that says you ca n't build a mammoth resort because there 's a bona fide green gill man living off Laguna Negra beach . And let 's say you can prove it before they lock you somewhere that does n't have any edges . What then ? No resort , no siree . And maybe Mr. Gills ends up on some laboratory 's meat slicer . Or on Leno . Which amounts to the same thing . <p> " Aw .... " She ca n't think of an expletive that quite describes her feelings . <p> She 's still turning the glass about in her hands , watching the play of gold California sunlight across its slick surface , when a commotion behind her makes her turn . <p> Four Tibetan monks in orange robes are walking toward the water . One of them carries a glass vase filled with colored sands . They are grinning at the ocean like kids contemplating some really great prank . Behind them is a crowd of spectators and news reporters . <p> For a moment Deirdre thinks the newspeople are there because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious knowledge of the Creature 's existence is achingly over . Then she sees the Buddhist monks and thinks that , no , the Creature was n't a creature at all but a fake , some kind of PR deal , a movie promo , and here 's the rest of it . <p> Then she watches the monks themselves . <p> The wind whips at their orange robes as they stride without hesitation into the water , unmindful of the cold and not bothering to hitch up their hems . The one holding the vase raises it high , and cameras begin to click . The monks start chanting prayers . <p> They are perhaps twenty feet away from Deirdre now . <p> They pray , smiling throughout , then bow- to the vase , to the ocean , to one another . The one holding the vase is completely bald , not even any eyebrows , and his ears stick out like jug handles . Happily he lowers the vase , and the other three monks laugh and say " Ahh ! " when he upends it and scatters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd applaud . Some seem startled . The monks pay no heed . They gleefully bend to the water and begin sloshing it everywhere , laughing as they mix the sand with the seawater , splashing each other and talking a mile a minute in their singsong language . <p> Then they bow to one another again , and to the ocean , and turn away . <p> One of them , the bald one with the jug-handle ears , sees Deirdre staring in startled wonder there in the water . He looks at the gleaming green thing in her hand , and he grins and nods as if he knows what it is , and even as if he knows what it means to her . He bows to Deirdre , nothing solemn about it at all , and Deirdre finds herself bowing back . <p> And then they are gone , clapping each other on the back , kicking back little trails of sand from their sandals , bright orange robes flapping like sails , and the crowd leaves with them . <p> Deirdre looks at the water where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there 's no sign it was ever there at all .
