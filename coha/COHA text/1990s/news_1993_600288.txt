<p> Chrysler CEO Robert Eaton , who replaced Lee Iacocca Jan. 1 , could n't have taken the helm at a better time . Sales are booming , Chrysler 's new lineup of midsize LH sedans is drawing rave reviews and the automaker ca n't make enough Jeep Grand Cherokees to meet demand . This fall , Chrysler unveils the bold Ram truck and spunky PL subcompact . Eaton , who joined Chrysler last year from General Motors ' European operations , is first to admit he did n't have much to do with developing those hot models . But he 'll have everything to do with Chrysler 's future . Eaton , 53 , spoke with USA TODAY editors and reporters last week . <p> Q : Dealers say the LH cars - Dodge Intrepid , Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde - are drawing flocks of buyers into showrooms . Have the cars met your expectations ? <p> A : They 've done exactly what we 'd hoped for . . . . We have brought with the LH the average age of our customer down about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 , and it 's 48 now . We have taken the average ( buyer 's annual ) income from about $ 42,000 to $ 59,000 , and we 've taken the education level up as well . We were purposely trying to divide the brands , as well . We wanted Eagle to appeal to an import ( buyer ) , Concorde to go after as close as we could the traditional Chrysler buyer , and we wanted the Dodge to be in between , and that 's exactly what 's happened . <p> Q : You were able to develop the five LH cars for $ 1.6 billion , which is what it can cost to bring one car to market . How did you do it ? <p> A : We are taking time out of the product-development cycle . That brings you closer to the market , so that you do n't have to make your final decisions until you 're ready to put the product out there to sell . . . . We are bringing the Dodge Neon ( small car ) to market later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program in 31 , 32 months ( vs. an industry average of 48 months . ) That 's a contrast to Ford 's Mondeo , which took five-plus years and $ 6 billion . At this point in time , we think we 've developed a real competitive advantage in bringing cars out . <p> Q : Dodge Viper was the first car you developed with your platform team system - small groups of engineers , designers and marketing experts that work on one car at a time . <p> A : Dodge Viper has more than fulfilled what it was intended to do , even if we never sold another one . It was designed to show people Chrysler could do more than just build K-cars and generate a little excitement . <p> Q : You 're benefiting , too , because people want to buy U.S. cars . <p> A : That 's a factor , as I think it should be . This country is finally starting to worry about jobs . We did n't worry about jobs a few years ago when the country was doing well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in this country . For every 100 vehicles the Japanese sell that are assembled here , they support nine jobs . Every imported vehicle that comes to this market supports zero manufacturing jobs . <p> A guy that I never met before came up to me six months ago , and said , " I have two teen-age kids at home . I 've been telling them how important our industrial base is . I realized I 've got to sell my import cars . So I went and I sold my Lexus and I bought an LH , and I also bought a Grand Cherokee . " <p> My own observation is that this is the least nationalistic country you can find , with Japan at one end of the spectrum with Germany , the U.K. in the center and us on the other side . People start to say , " Hey , wait a minute . We do need an industrial base . " We also have to give them products that are every bit as good in quality , and we 're doing it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other companies have n't made money on small cars built in the USA . <p> A : It will not ( meet ) our average return , but we can make a return . That is , at least , the big news on that car . We also think it 's a really exciting car . We think it 's going to bring a lot of people back into showrooms . <p> Q : What 's the status of the Plymouth and Eagle brands ? <p> A : The market has decided : We will continue to have Plymouth and we 'll continue to have Eagle . <p> Q : Chrysler has become the good example of a well-run company in Detroit . Will success spoil Chrysler ? <p> A : The answer is obviously no . This management has gone through two very , very tough declines and they do n't ever want to go through another one . ( The key ) is to keep focused on absolutely outstanding products , keep the costs coming down at the same rate they 've been coming down as we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going up , so you absolutely run right past those guys , and work very hard on customer satisfaction . <p> I believe very strongly that what we 're truly selling is customer satisfaction and private transportation - not cars . When I talk to dealers , I tell them , " You 've got to get out of the mind-set of selling cars . " I think it makes a huge difference in how they approach the business - if you 're selling customer satisfaction instead of cars . <p> Q : How did the second crisis at Chrysler ( in 1989-90 ) come about ? Was n't Lee Iacocca sitting there in 1984 saying those exact same things ? <p> A : I 'm not going to try to say what happened . But in general , the management team that was assembled then had a lot of financial orientation , a lot of dealmaking orientation . They obviously , in hindsight , took their eye off the ball a little bit . Lee Iacocca has said that more than once . They started looking at defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This management has collectively said , " We are in the passenger car and light-truck business and nothing else . And we are going to try to become the premier car company and nothing else . " You will not see this team diversify in any way or take its eye off the ball . <p> Q : What do you think about the federal auto safety agency 's calls for GM to recall 1973-87 pickup trucks , even though they met safety rules at the time ? GM 's chief counsel , Harry Pearce , says part of the problem is that there is no federal safety administrator to set policy . <p> A : I do n't think Harry Pearce ever said anything I do n't agree with ( laughs ) . You 've got a tremendous problem when you meet the nation 's standards , and then ( the government says ) you have a problem with the government itself , much less the courts . One of the biggest differences between being in Europe and being here is the way the court system works ( there ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lawsuits we had at GM Europe - which sells 1.8 million cars a year - was less than 10 . The number of lawsuits that Chrysler has is in excess of 8,000 . We are in an extremely litigious society . People are growing up expecting a riskless society . It is a tremendous burden . <p> Q : Is n't 110 yen to the dollar in essence a tariff that hurts Japanese automakers ? Why do you need any more help from the U.S. government ? <p> A : We 've never , ever been after help . <p> Q : What about the proposed dumping suit against Japanese carmakers ? <p> A : That 's not help , that 's the law of this land . Are you going to enforce securities laws ? If you 've got dumping laws , are you going to enforce them or not ? <p> Q : Is Chrysler the ideal size for a domestic car company ? Experts suggest GM is too big , a dinosaur in this market . . . . <p> A : I do n't think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ability to react quickly are opposed to each other . We are of adequate size to remain a healthy , free-standing company , provided we get through this cycle with a healthy balance sheet . We are as big as some of the free-standing companies in Europe and Japan . I do n't think companies the size of GM and Toyota are dinosaurs . <p> Q : Do you think GM can become as flexible as you are ? <p> A : I think it will take some doing . They will have to continue to evolve their organization as they have been doing , but I think it 's possible . <p> About Robert Eaton <p> Born : Feb. 13 , 1940 , Buena Vista , Colo .
