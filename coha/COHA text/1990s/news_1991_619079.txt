<p> Millions of homeowners are enjoying an early Christmas bonus by trading in their old double-digit mortgages for fixed- rate loans that now average 8.49 percent or adjustable loans that average 6.2 percent . <p> But experts say you should consider more than just current interest rate trends before rushing to repackage your mortgage . <p> Tom Holloway , senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington , D.C. , expects interest rates to fall another 50 basis points to 8 percent for a 30-year , fixed rate loan . <p> So does Mortgage Bankers Association economist Richard Peach , who suggests , " You may want to get the paperwork started , but wait until rates drop that extra quarter before you lock in . " <p> However , Mortgage Market Weekly publisher Dave Wallace points out that a borrower runs the risk of losing significant amounts of money by waiting too long . For example , if you have a $ 150,000 , 30- year fixed rate mortgage at 10 percent and interest rates are now at 8.5 percent , you could be saving $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 6 months for mortgages to drop to 8 percent , you 're going to lose money in the meantime , " he said . " Even if you do get a rate later at 8 percent , it 'll take nearly 2 years to make up the money you could have been saving if you had refinanced earlier . " <p> Borrowers also should consider the costs of taking out a new loan . These include ' points '  --  prepaid interest charged by the lender  --  credit application fees , appraisal and title report fees , inspection fees and mortgage insurance . Industry experts say the average homeowner spends 1 percent to 3 percent of their loan amount on closing costs . <p> Some lenders make sure that the borrower is n't saddled with out-of- pocket expenses by wrapping such fees into the balance of the loan . Others will waive the costs in exchange for a higher interest rate . <p> Consumers need to consider several factors when determining whether to refinance a home : the difference between the old mortgage rate and the new one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to live there . <p> The old rule of thumb is that you 'll come out ahead by refinancing if the new loan is two percentage points below the current loan . But Keith Gumbinger , an analyst with HSH Associates , disagrees . <p> " That 's a lousy rule because it does n't take into account how much in other fees are involved and how long the homeowner plans to stay in the house , " he said . " If you 're going to be in a house very long , you can get away with refinancing if rates drop 1 percent or even less . " <p> For example , he said a homeowner with a $ 100,000 fixed-rate mortgage currently at 10 percent might refinance if he can get a 9 percent rate with no points and plans to remain in the same house for at least two years . " Your payment at 9 percent will come to $ 804.62 versus $ 877.57 at 10 percent on such a loan , for a monthly saving of $ 72.95 , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal fees that may come to about $ 1,000 , you can break even at the new lower rate in just 14 months . " <p> However , such a loan with two points would cost about $ 3,000 in up-front fees , and would take an additional 41 months to break even . If you plan to move in the next 4 1/2 years , you would be better off sticking with your current mortgage and avoiding the costs associated with refinancing . Some lenders who want to retain customers may offer to refinance the current mortgage for just $ 250 to $ 450 . But Wallace of Mortgage Market Weekly cautions that with such loans " you wo n't get the best rate , and only in rare cases will it be cost-effective to refinance . " <p> Someone with less than 20 percent equity in a house , or the owner of a home that has declined in value also may have difficulty refinancing to save money . Such consumers usually end up paying for their low equity position by paying higher interest rates and mortgage insurance costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risks of refinancing with a tax or financial adviser who can help calculate how particular refinancing deals can affect monthly payments and tax liability . They point out , for example , that unlike the original home purchase , points associated with refinancing can not be written off in the first year , but have to be written off over the life of the loan . <p> Borrowers who want their payments to remain constant or who plan to remain in their house for a long time may want to choose a fixed rate loan rather than an adjustable loan . <p> Nearly 50 lenders are offering adjustable rate mortgages at 5 percent or less that adjust upward after one year . However , many would-be borrowers may find they ca n't qualify for such loans since the Federal National Mortgage Association , which purchases the loans from lenders for sale to investors in the secondary market , requires that borrowers must qualify for at least a 7 percent start rate . <p> The basic cost of refinancing can be figured out with a pocket calculator . Here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates and calculate the difference in monthly payments by referring to an amortization table . ( See Chart ) . <p> Then add up all the fees and costs that go into the refinancing  --  points , taxes and transfer fees , title search , insurance , appraisals , and credit check charges . Gumbinger of HSH suggests you add 10 percent to this cost estimate for fees you may forget to ask about . <p> Divide the costs by the amount you would save on each monthly payment to determine how long it will take you to break even . Some experts suggest you add a few months to the total to account for an increase in federal taxes , because you 'll be able to deduct less if your interest payment is lower . <p> CHART : <p> HOW TO FIGURE MONTHLY SAVINGS FROM REFINANCING To figure out what your monthly mortgage payments will be at the new low interest rates , use the following table and instructions . Take your total mortgage and divide it by 1,000 . For example , if your mortgage is $150,000 , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current interest rate on the chart . 3 . Slide over to the column marked " factor " that applies to your loan . If your mortgage is a 30-year and your interest rate is 10.5% , the factor you need to figure out your payment is 9.15. 4 . Multiply 150 ( for the mortgage ) by 9.15 . Your current monthly payment is $1,372.50. 5 . Do the same for the rate at which you could refinance . If your mortgage is $150,000 and you can refinance at 8.75% , multiply 150 by 7.87 . The monthly payment at that rate is $1,180.50 . Refinancing would save you $192 each month , if there were no front-end costs to get a new mortgage . . BC : INTEREST RATE FACTOR FOR FACTOR FOR ( IN PERCENT ) 15-YR . TERM 30-YR .
