Drop by Lincoln Center whenever a work by Jerome Robbins is on the program at the New York City Ballet , and chances are you 'll see a 26-year-old Brit with a long neck and a big , bright smile . N.Y.C.B. soloist Christopher Wheeldon is engaging and reliable , and he knows how to make the most of a Robbins role . But last week he swapped his tights for a business suit to take a bow with 62 children from the School of American Ballet as 2,000 dancegoers yelled their heads off . The occasion was the premiere of his own Scenes de Ballet , which confirmed what balletomanes have been saying for the past couple of seasons : Wheeldon is not only a fine dancer ; he 's also the best young ballet choreographer around . <P> Unlike dancemakers who favor the hard-edged , stripped-down contemporary idiom that he crisply dismisses as " technoballet , " Wheeldon is an unabashed classicist . His style , a bracingly confident fusion of George Balanchine 's structural clarity with the sunny lyricism of Frederick Ashton , is respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sucker for tutus , toe shoes and moonlit pas de deux . " I do n't have much angst in me , " he says . " I love to be romantic . " <P> That 's evident in Scenes de Ballet , set to the delectable score by Igor Stravinsky . Ian Falconer 's set depicts a ballet classroom bisected by a barre and an imaginary mirror ; the cast is similarly divided into " real " dancers and their " reflections . " At one point , a child gazes into the mirror and her image vanishes , replaced by two teenagers who dance together rapturously as she looks on , spellbound . <P> But Wheeldon can do much more than conjure up spun-sugar fantasies . The witty Soiree Musicale , which the school premiered last year , for instance , contains a show-stopping tango in which a femme fatale picks up new partners one by one , eventually dancing with a dozen admirers simultaneously . And Corybantic Ecstasies , given its premiere in March by the Boston Ballet , is a tough-minded , tautly argued work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classical ballet with high emotion . <P> Born in Somerset , England , Wheeldon entered the Royal Ballet School at nine and started making up his own dances shortly thereafter . Hired by the Royal Ballet in 1991 , he spent two restless years in the corps . Fascinated by the ballets of Balanchine , N.Y.C.B. 's founder , he left for New York City and took class with the company . " If I had n't done that , " he says , " I might still be back in London , standing on the side of the stage holding a tray . " Instead , ballet master in chief Peter Martins , always on the lookout for promising young male dancers , offered him a job . <P> Robbins promptly cast Wheeldon in Dances at a Gathering , his signature piece . Martins , after looking at videotapes of dances Wheeldon had made as a student , invited him to do one for the School of American Ballet in 1994 . Three years later , Wheeldon choreographed his first work for the main company . Slavonic Dances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company 's most exciting young ballerina , drew critical raves and kicked off a new phase of his career .
