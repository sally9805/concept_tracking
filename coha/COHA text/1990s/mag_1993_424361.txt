<p> Knowing firsthand that it 's not easy being a kid today , ' concern for today 's children tops her list of priorities . <p> It was another grueling day along the Clinton-Gore campaign trail . Tipper Gore had already tapped her toes to bluegrass and shaken the hands of an endless line of fire-fighters , but she was especially " up " that day and an idea was percolating in her mind . <p> What if an anonymous admirer were to call her spouse on the " Larry King Live " show airing later that night and flirt with the vice presidential candidate ? What would Al 's reaction be ? Tipper decided to find out . First , she called the producer and told him , " Do n't tell Al or Larry King . " She then worked on disguising her voice . <p> Neither Gore nor King had any idea who was on the line when a rehearsed Tipper phoned the show . <p> " Hi , Senator Gore , I know I probably should n't say this , but I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " caller said . " Are you available for a date sometime ? " <p> A very surprised Al Gore blushed , stammered , then quickly but politely refused . <p> " We had an absolute belly laugh . recalls lean Nelson , Tipper s campaign director and an attorney with the Tennessee Attorney General 's Office . " That famous Ashville call to Larry King Live ' is the quint-essential Tipper . " <p> " We had a good time during the campaign , " Nelson adds , " and that was one of the things Tipper really wanted to do . She felt that the spirit of the campaign could be helped by a focus on humor . " <p> Evidently her strategy worked . <p> Born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson in August 1948 to John " Jack " and Margaret Ann Aitcheson , she was dubbed " Tipper " by her mother early on : a nickname derived from a favorite nursery rhyme . <p> An only child , Tipper was raised by her mother and grandmother . Her father owned a large and successful plumbing supply business : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tipper and her own family . <p> " Sometimes it is better for people to divorce , " Tipper reflects now . " It was a motivating factor for me . I learned that it takes a lot of hard work to make a relationship work . Fortunately , I found a man early on with whom I fell in love at first sight and am still in love with today . Our marriage represents a lot of loving work on both sides . " <p> Tipper met her future husband in high school . At a graduation party held in St. Albans , Al asked the young lady to dance , and romance began . Gore invited Tipper Aitcheson on a date . She accepted . Several dates later , the two began talking marriage . They have been together 28 years . <p> Vice President Gore introduces his wife as " the most important person in my life . " On the campaign trail , reporters more than once glimpsed then . snuggling on the bus . <p> While Tipper attended Boston College , Al was at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served in Vietnam , Tipper protested the war . Gore 's father , former U.S. Senator Albert Gore Sr. , lost a heated re-election bid over his opposition to the Vietnam conflict . <p> Disillusioned with politics and distraught over what he had witnessed during his stint in Vietnam , Al Gore Jr . and his wife moved their family back to the small town of Carthage , about 40 miles outside of Nashville , Tenn . Here , he took a job as a reporter at The Tennessean newspaper , eventually entering Vanderbilt University 's Divinity School before deciding to tackle politics himself . Tipper also worked at the newspaper as a part-time photographer-an avocation she rekindled with zeal during last summer 's presidential campaign , snapping what some professionals call the most coveted inside shots of the entire campaign . During this time , she also earned a master 's degree in psychology from George Peabody College in Nashville . <p> Tipper Gore 's outside activities have never impinged on her most coveted role as a mother . She keeps a close watch over their four children : Karenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Albert III , 10 . <p> " If Leave It to Beaver ' were still on television today , Beaver would be a latchkey kid and Eddie Haskell would be dealing drugs , " she says . " It 's not easy being a kid today . " <p> During the campaign , she insisted her schedule allow return trips to Arlington or to Carthage every Friday night to spend the weekend with her children . <p> Tipper 's protectiveness of her children led to her much-publicized founding of the Parents Music Resource Center in 1985 . That high-profile organization pushed the music industry to voluntarily place warning labels on records containing explicitly sexual or violent lyrics . <p> Tipper began the campaign after listening to Prince 's Purple Rain album that she bought for her then 11-year-old daughter and being shocked by sexually explicit lyrics in the song " Darling Nikki . " Her friends warned her that her stance on music labels might be " misinterpreted , " says Natalie Dunning , a writer who has known the Gores since they all worked together at The Tennessean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship and government control . Recently , Tipper met with industry executives to " clear the air of misunderstandings of her efforts . " Censorship was never the intent of her crusade against rock music lyrics . Rather the purpose of the PMRC was to keep parents aware of their children 's environment . <p> Tipper is " . . . a natural activist , " says Dunning . " If something affects her kids , she is not just going to sit around and talk about it . She gets involved and makes something happen . She really believes she can make a difference , and she does . " <p> For the record , Tipper Gore is no stranger to rock music . She played the drums in an all-girl garage band called " The Wildcats " during high school . <p> " I got a set when I was 14 , " Mrs. Gore remembers , " and just started to play in the house to the stereo . " Still a rock and jazz fan , Gore listens to Grateful Dead albums on occasion . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of music in our home from classical to rap . " <p> At the heart of her various crusades is concern for today 's children . In 1987 , in her ongoing push for parental knowledge , she published a book titled Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society . <p> " A stable family is an ethic to work toward and gift to be valued , " Tipper states . " Loyalty , solidarity , flexibility , and accountability are what makes a family work . <p> " Certainly that is what I try to portray to my children . It is important that they know what is expected of them , and that they be held accountable , whether it is walking the dogs or taking out the trash . There needs to be some responsibility , " she says , quickly adding , " I 'm also very flexible and very forgiving . " <p> Tipper has raised her own children with structure , boundaries , and rules . When little , the kids went to their rooms for " time out " if tempers exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as punishment . <p> " It works , " she says . " And it 's not done in anger . It 's done to impress on them the expectations that we want them to honor . In a way , we are teaching them how to deal with their own emotions . " <p> " The key to making a large family work , or any family , but certainly our family , is communication , " Gore stresses . " We have family meetings once a week . We try to do it on Sunday so everybody can talk about the coming week and what 's ahead , so we can all focus on it . " <p> The close-knit family 's darkest hour arrived in 1989 . Leaving the opening-day Orioles game in Baltimore , son Albert was hit by a car . <p> Vice President Gore remembers looking down and seeing death in his young son 's eyes that day . Amazingly , the critically injured little boy survived . But the accident and the slow healing process transformed their lives for the next year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearily alternated round-the-clock shifts at his side at John Hopkins Children 's Center in Baltimore . The trauma , unfortunately , had just started . <p> Natalie Dunning recalls a visit she and her husband , Frank Sutherland , made to Albert 's hospital room . <p> " He was immobilized , " she remembers . " He was in a lot of pain , and was on medication . The room was crowded with all kinds of gifts . We gave him a book and , understandably , he was less than enthusiastic . Tipper thanked us , and then she turned and prompted him to say thank you , too . The thing that struck me was that I really admired her strength in not suspending the rules of polite behavior to a child she had almost lost . You want to give in and do everything for the child because of the trauma . For me , that was another indication of Tipper 's maturity . " <p> When Albert was well enough to return home , it was in a full-length body cast . The Gores transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all pulled together , " she recalls . " It made the family stronger . The support was there , and that was critical . We gave each of his sisters a role in his recovery . Albert had to be turned regularly each night during this period , and the children took turns staying up with him so Al and I could get some sleep . So many families in that situation do n't get that kind of support . " <p> Tipper 's advice to other families who suffer tragedy  --  be it an injury , a death , a divorce , or whatever  --  is to reach out for help " from anywhere you can get it . " <p> But the tragedy days are over now . Life has resumed a degree of normalcy . Today son Albert likes to rollerblade . Fitness-minded mom rollerblades alongside . <p> " When weather permits , I like to vary jogging with rollerblading or a long walk , " Tipper says . " But more and more I am becoming a runner . " Tipper , 44 , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thinks it 's good to take a day off and rest . And , yes , this closely knit family even exercises together , whenever possible . <p> As second lady of the nation , Tipper Gore is committed to supporting programs that help families in need and promoting a greater understanding of mental illness . She also will continue her work to improve the plight of the homeless . <p> " I would like to be a voice for the children , " she says . <p> The desire to make a difference in both her own family 's and others ' worlds dates back to that childhood pain . <p> " I felt a real empathy for other kids like myself , " Tipper Gore reveals . " Early on I knew that I wanted to do something to help people . " <p> And she has been doing just that ever since . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Often described as quiet , Tipper has a quick wit that delighted members of the " Gore Corps " during the campaign .
