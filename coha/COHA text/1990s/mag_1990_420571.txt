Section : CRISIS IN THE GULF The mail brings the soldier 's story of a showdown with Iraq  --  and plenty of moral support from home <p> They do n't sell flowers out in the Sandpile . So one day Pfc . John Duggan , 24 , a United States Marine who worked as a nightclub bouncer before turning his attention to Saddam Hussein , picked some dry weeds and mailed them to his fiancee . " These weeds are my roses , " he wrote her . And he sent them with his love . <p> In the Sandpile , it is always summer . So as fall spread across America , the father of Cmdr. Sue Carroll , a Navy nurse , cut some autumn leaves and sent them to her in Saudi Arabia . She hung them up in her tent . Now , each time she looks at them , she says , they remind her " that somewhere back there is a place where they lead normal lives  --  and love me . " <p> Mail call  --  a soldier 's story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf . Each week more than 75 tons of mail come scudding in from zones of danger around Kuwait . Not since Vietnam have there been deliveries like these . In millions of letters home , soldiers are writing a foxhole chronicle of America 's showdown with Iraq . Even though no one is shooting yet , the mail is full of war stories : the " Kiss ' em goodbye " alert stateside , the barf-bag trip to the gulf , the heat , the flies , the dead camels beyond the defense perimeter , scorpions big as field mice , sand vipers slithering through the dunes . Each day you dig in deeper , waiting for the balloon to go up . At night , by flashlight , you pull out your ballpoint  --  and wish to hell you were home . <p> In reply , the home front is sending barrages of moral support : anxious letters from moms , proud letters from dads , bantering letters from friends , love letters . Schoolkids adopt whole units as pen pals . A cat signs a card with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . There 's the home video of missed birthdays . On an audiocassette , a little boy says " Papa . " There 's the exuberant phone call , and the familiar voice on the message machine . Even the fax has gone to war . A woman plants a perfect kiss on the machine down at AT &T's; Desert Fax center . A pregnant wife sends a sonogram of the twins growing in her womb . And there are goodies . A Massachusetts photographer opens Operation Desert Cheer , shooting free pinups of wives and girlfriends for the troops . A Maine lobsterman dreams of sending tons of lobster . Sheila Ramsey , a paratrooper 's mother , says , " It would be nice if we could send a million turkeys  --  all cooked and ready to chow down on Thanksgiving . " <p> If these demonstrations at times seem a bit giddy , they address a sober reality . When Jamie Reed-Sutton , 22 , born one month after her father was killed in Vietnam , learned that her boyfriend , an ensign on the USS Ogden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst from her bedroom and sobbed to her mother , " It 's starting to happen all over . Do n't let it turn out like Dad . " For the soldier in country in the Middle East , after the fear of dying and the pang of longing for family , friends and lovers , the worst goad is the thought of being sold out like the Viet vets . More than 100 tons of mail each week says this time it 's different . At one mail call out in the Sandpile , Air Force Master Sgt. John Massengill studied the daily haul and said , " In Vietnam , you 'd get one parcel a year with a note saying ' America loves you '  --  signed by someone in the Salvation Army . Now all of my guys have been flooded with letters and CARE packages . I 've never seen so much stuff . " <p> The grunts now on alert in the gulf are members of a volunteer army , not draftees like those who served at the peak of the Vietnam War . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of them was gung ho . " Remember this , " Preston Coffer , 24 , a Marine corporal , wrote to friends in Texas . " We are talking about Marines , not the Boy Scouts . We all joined the service knowing full well what might be expected of us . " And he signed off " Semper Fi . " Others felt similar pangs . Adrian Ingraham , 20 , a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne , was the youngest of three Ingraham sons ordered to the Middle East . " Momma Daddy , we all have jobs to do , " he wrote home . He told them not to ask the Army to reassign him if Oswald , 34 , or Irwin , 22 , is killed . Then he headed out . " If something should happen to me , " he wrote , " my will is in my wall locker at Fort Bragg . Room 211 . I did n't have time to send it home . " <p> Few expected to face such a dangerous mission quite so abruptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality sank in when he had to follow regulations and send his wedding ring to his next of kin . " It felt as if my ring finger was naked , " he wrote his wife , Christie . " Every time I try to feel it or look down and it 's not there , I just think about you . " Explaining to the children why you had to say goodbye was the hardest . One Army colonel wrote to his young son , " Do you remember how fast you ran down the beach to get me when your cousin was hurt so badly ? That showed how strong and brave you are in helping other people . Someday it may be your time to give back to life what God gave you . When that time comes , I know you will . Be good . Love , Daddy . " <p> Some troops flew , sitting on equipment crammed into transports , others went by sea , packed like sardines . No matter how they got there , they knew the Sandpile was waiting for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came from Hawaii , wrote to his parents , saying , " Hey , the Persian Gulf sounds nasty , but it 's beautiful , too . Crystal clear water . Dolphins following the boat . " Returning from a flight , Gary Porterfield , 28 , an Air Force pilot , wrote : " It 's nothing but sand . One big beach . I ca n't believe people actually live here . " The place had a way of bringing out the Omar Khayyam in the most prosaic grunt . " You should see the night , " Army Sp/4 Larry Campbell wrote his wife , Barbara . " The sky comes alive with a billion stars and a moon that seems as bright as a spotlight . It 's like you can see the whole galaxy . " <p> In sunlight , the view was harsher . During the dog hours of 11 to 4 , the temperature rose to 130 degrees , then plummeted . After sweating all day , you shivered after dark when you stepped out of the cold-water showers , from buildings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon . Lunch was MREs , the postmodern C rations the supply sergeant called " meals-ready-to- eat . " Then could count on mystery meat for dinner . The desalinated drinking water came from the gulf and tasted like something out of a neglected swimming pool in southern California . The snakes were bad , so were the bugs : beetles armored like little tanks and scorpions of all sizes . " The big f  --  ers are black emperors , " Campbell wrote to his son T.J. They were the size of plump mice  --  and twice as mean as rattlesnakes . <p> Mail was slow in arriving at first , then it started coming by the plane and truckload , bringing its small consolations : cookies , candy and Sweetarts , protectively wrapped in trail mix and popcorn ; Kool-Aid and Gatorade powder ; dipping snuff and suntan oil laced with aloe ; toothpaste , soap and jock-itch powder . The windfall put the troops in better humor . After one company started sending free sunglasses , Sergeant Massengill wrote the Buck Knives company of El Cajon , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Bowie M9 field knife ( $170 ) he would " volunteer to test it by crawling over the border and performing open heart surgery on Saddam Hussein  --  without an anesthetic . " He 's still waiting . " What an advertisement , " he says with a laugh . " The blade that ended a war . " <p> Getting to know the Saudis was n't as hard as doping out the enemy , but it presented a culture shock . King Fahd made a good impression when he offered to pay $1,000 to the troops , who receive $114 a month in <p> imminent-danger pay , $8 a month in foreign-duty pay ; but the commander in chief turned him down . " Thanks Bush , " one grunt wrote in a note stateside . " He says ' We 're not mercenaries . ' True ! But he does n't have all the bills we have . " <p> Second Lt. Robert Myers , 23 , a paratrooper , wrote his father that Arabs were zipping around in Chevrolet Caprice Classics with the dealer 's stickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a small piece of green carpet for teeing off . Their temples had loudspeakers calling them to prayer five times a day . Don Hartley , 26 , a Marine lance corporal , wrote a pen pal , saying , " They have dead animals everywhere and probably people , too , because I have n't seen a graveyard yet  --  I think it has something to do with their religion . A car got hit by one of our vehicles and the cops said it was tfate from Allah . ' In California a million dollar lawsuit would have been filed . Nothing here . " <p> The banter made everyone feel better in the early phases of the military buildup ; but as the psy-war in the gulf threatened to become the real thing , the mood changed . David Martin , 19 , of the 101st Airborne , wrote his sister Kelley that he and his buddy Ray were the two forward-most Americans at the front : nothing but Saudis ahead of them . Mail arrived every three days , by truck and by chopper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel " a sense of momentum toward a clash . . . lots of movement , lots of equipment . " He was an easy-going guy  --  he wrote his letters on Garfield the Cat stationery imprinted " If life is a bridge to be crossed , let 's dawdle all we can " - but he confessed to his sister that he got " more and more nervous every day . " <p> Others felt the same way . Herbert Plummer , 21 , a para-trooper , wrote his mother to say that some nights he could n't sleep " because of my fear of this place . " He did n't know why , , but " being in this country makes me so jumpy I can almost feel as if someone was watching me . No lie ! " At other outposts , dead camels beyond the defense perimeters made the desert stink . A fire incinerated one unit 's mail-room . Nerves tautened . Even friends grew edgy . Then , each evening just after dark , Baghdad Betty , Saddam Hussein 's answer to Tokyo Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tells us we 're going to die and Iraqi worms are going to eat us , " Army Sgt. Eric Petersen reported to his wife , Mary-ann . " Pretty awful , huh ? " <p> The phony war before a real one can get dangerous soon enough . Glen Bullock , 20 , a Marine corporal , wrote his mother , apologizing for not finishing one of her letters because " itjust so happened that one ofthe Marines accidentally fired off two rounds out of the Mk 19 a grenade launcher and almost hit the Marines guarding the road block . " An angry CO sent Bullock and some buddies to replace the shaken jarheads . Other near misses came right out of " Catch-22 . " Cpl . Jason Day , 20 , wrote his family that a jittery captain on a caffeine binge from too many Pepsis had mistaken a shooting star for an incoming Scud missile hitting the atmosphere and sounded a nuclear-missile alert . " Holy Idiotic Stupid Batman ! " Day exploded . " He got his ass reamed for that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael N. ( Chip ) Manns Jr. , 23 , a machinist 's mate third class aboard the USS Iwo Jima , wrote his father about the frustrations aboard a ship jammed with sailors : " men in my workspace , men in the chowline , men in the showers , men all around when I 'm sleeping , men , men , men . " He told his mother he stood eight hours of watch a day , worked eight , then slept four to six hours each night in the jammed quarters . " Everything is pretty routine , " he wrote . " Actually , being over here does n't bother me that much . It 's just the waiting . If we are going to war . I wish we would get the show on the road . " Two weeks later a steam pipe on the Iwo Jima ruptured . The blast killed Chip Manns . <p> Somewhere south of Kuwait , the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is dug into desert trenches , its 165-mm howitzers ready to deliver supporting fire for a tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the tailgate of a truck for mail call . In the heat and dust of the outpost , letters become tattered and stained . Capt . Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son . It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial  --  the flag raising on Iwo Jima  --  and the words " To Dad . You make me proud Dad . Jeremy . " Offto the side , Pfc . John Duggan hopes for word from his fiancee Kathryn Redman . They were engaged three days before he was sent to Saudi Arabia . " I 'm in love , I ca n't think about anything else , " he says . " I feel totally empty . I live in a hole in the ground and the only thing that helps me pass the time is her letters , " he says . He writes her constantly . One time he pulled some hair oflf his chest and sent it to her . She sent him back a strand of her hair . Then he sent her those desert weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right here , " she says . " At the end of the tape I was hugging the speaker next to me . " <p> The mail coming from home to the troops is less vivid , but in some ways far more important . The top brass in the gulf understands that a soldier 's best friend , next to his rifle , is the postman . " Mail is critically important , " says Lt. Gen. Walt Boomer who learned its potency as a morale builder in Vietnam . If anything , Saudi Arabia is even more remote culturally than Southeast Asia , where it was possible to strike up friendships with locals and easier to go on leave . Troops are warned not to fraternize with the Saudis . In the desert , on the flight lines , on the ships , in the military hospitals , there are no movies , nobars , nogirls . Mail is the link between the man isolated in the country and the real world outside . " What I am delivering here is more important than gold  --  literally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 380 men and women now handling mail in Saudi Arabia . <p> About 85 percent of Major Vaughn 's letters and packages are addressed to individuals . He gives those marked " To any service personnel " to people who get nothing from home . It is not uncommon to find a battle-hardened Viet vet like Massengill carrying on earnest correspondence with 7- and 8-year-old kids and dusty grunts laughing over lines from tiny pen pals like " If you guys ca n't end it , then my Dad might have to come . " Kids not much younger than Pfc . Hosi Johnson , 19 , of the 101st Airborne , who was in high school in Chicago only a year ago , write to ask if he feels scared . He tells them , " Yes , it 's always at the back of my mind . I told one kid that I joined the Army to pay my way through school and I said I might not make it through  --  but I tell them I live in hope . " <p> Mail alone can not neutralize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sgt. William Fitzgerald , 30 , was too young for Vietnam . When he joined the corps 11 years ago , he heard Viet vets telling horror stories all the time . " They 'd get letters from home , sure , " he says . " But the media , the war protesters , even some of the politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing , they were murderers , they were on their own . " Now he gets letters from a nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II . " She told me she was proud of what we were doing , and cared for us and  --  with a name like Fitzgerald to say a rosary if I was Catholic . " He heard his son say " Papa " for the first time when his wife , Carole , sent him an audiotape . Determined that the American soldier wo n't be forgotten this time , she has distributed 2.000 aluminum bracelets marked " 1990  --  ' Til our Fighting Forces Return . " She has also written to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when they start complaining about the price of gas to think of the people who are putting their lives on the line . " <p> That includes women , who share the alternating currents of boredom and pain that now course through daily life in the gulf . At the U.S. Navy 's Fleet Hospital Five in Jubail , where tents with 500 beds , intensive care and X-ray units are pitched and ready for casualties , Lt. Carla Tolbert says , " Life gets strange here  --  something like a prison , something like a girl 's school . " Husbands write that the house is too big ; they feel lonely . The pressure builds . Some mail is therapeutic . One day a package with bubble soap arrived . " All 10 of us in the tent started blowing bubbles like little kids , and the whole patio was covered in froth , " Tolbert remembers . Other mail calls are tougher . Capt . April Gauthier , a nurse practitioner in a MASH unit , received a letter from her husband , Richard , saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries . She soothed him . Then she asked about reports that her daughter Carmen was getting " her mommy hugs " from a friend 's wife : " That went through me like a spear ! " <p> The mail is a bridge , however rickety , between duty and love . Out on the line , Marine Lance Cpl . Frank Gudmundson , 22 , a fire team leader who will see sharp fighting if war breaks out , logs his letters and thoughts in a journal . He has entitled his little notebook " Total ( 1990 ) Recall . " " My mind and my heart belong at home with my wife , but my ass belongs to the Marine Corps , " he writes in one passage . The next sentence is " I will stand by patiently for mail call . " When his mother sent a photo of him and his brothers as little kids , he wrote in his diary , " It seems like yesterday we were out playing army with our plastic machine guns , building bunkers out of hay bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it 's the real thing today . And I do n't think counting to fifty will bring us back alive . " <p> Gudmundson 's wife , Danelle , sent him a letter telling him she missed him at her Lamaze natural-childbirth classes , where she was the only woman without a husband . She is due to have the baby any day . He has been writing a long poem for Danelle and his unborn child : " Here it is , another starry night , I reach for her , but she is far out of sight ... I try to take this war day by day , but the loneliness and heartache will never go away . " He has n't mailed the poem . He wants to deliver it in person . <p> Something about these letters in the sand subverts the conventional wisdom about what is at risk in the gulf Presidents and kings , diplomats and generals speak the language of geopolitics and global economics . To them , the flow of oil is more important than the flow of mail . After listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a relief to read things like , " Hello , Devil Dog Family , " the salutation of a dusty Marine . You worry about what could happen to these pen pals if war does come , and very little that the top dogs have to say helps much . " I wish I could help , " writes Salome Welliver , a fourth grader from Kansas City . " But I 'm just a nine-year-old . I pray for you and peace . If a war starts you can win . God bless you .

I wish I could be there to hold both you and her or him . Did l tell you we haue gone halfway around the world ? I talked to my division officer the other day , and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make sure that I am home for the birth of our child . You know how he knows I am having a child is that he saw you when you came aboard the ship Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote ? If not , you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and grandbaby are doing . lf lam not home when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital Have you picked out a baby bed yet ?

Let 's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each other . That 's all . P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I get home . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Brooks 's mother , Shelley , with the flag from his casket <p> TO SIR , WITH LOVE : <p> Lt. Col. David Wood of the 101st Airborne got no mail  --  except two bills-until teacher Charlotte Waller had her fifth-grade class write to him . From his reply : <p> I 've been in Saudi Arabia almost 40 days . We got here by flying in big AirForce planes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We move around the battlefield in Army Blackhawk helicopters . We do most of our flying at night when it 's very dark . <p> The desert is huge . The country is about one half the size of America and it 's all desert . In every direction , there 's only sand and hills . We have to be very careful because if we get lost it can be very dangerous . There are all kinds of desert creatures  --  pit and horned vipers ( snakes ) , cobras , camel spiders , scorpions ( black , greene and red ) . Some of our soldiers catch the spiders and scorpions and keep them for pets . They name them  --  " Spike the Scorpion " or " Clyde the Camel Spider . " <p> Right now we are living near an oasis . There is a small deserted village here and it 's over 300 years old . Camels , wild and goats come to drink water from the well and eat the dates that fad from the trees . <p> Even though our soldiers and pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war , all of us here DO N'T WANT that to happen . War is not what you see at the movies ; it 's ugly and painful . We 're here to protect other people and because this part of the world is very imporgant to our economy and businesses .
