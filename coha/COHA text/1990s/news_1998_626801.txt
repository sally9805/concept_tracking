<p> LOS ANGELES - Antonio Banderas takes pride in being the first Spaniard to play Zorro , the fictional Spanish hero of pulp magazines , television and more than 50 films dating back to the silent era . <p> Then again , who is that masked man ? <p> In the first scene of The Mask of Zorro , a refreshingly low-tech yet lavish action romp opening Friday , the masked hero looks strangely like - could it be ? Yes , Welshman Anthony Hopkins . <p> But after Hopkins fights greedy Spanish oppressors in early 1800s California , a 20-year jump-cut brings Banderas into the picture . He plays Alejandro , a young rogue who 's tutored by the aristocratic Don Diego ( Hopkins ) to become the new champion of early California settlers . <p> Soon Alejandro is donning Zorro 's black garb , wielding the whip , riding the horse called Tornado and brandishing the distinctive " Z " with a flick of his sword . <p> " It was n't until I saw the film recently that it really occurred to me : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a recent interview here . <p> Not that he and Banderas were fighting for the spotlight . Even when Hopkins ' character teaches the younger man sword-fighting - with painful precision - " we were never really competitive , " Hopkins said . <p> " You do it ( fencing ) without any angst . You rehearse it like a dance . It 's a piece of choreography . " <p> For his part , Banderas was more intent on bringing humor than brawny action mettle , which he 's already displayed in films such as Desperado , to the adventurer 's role . <p> " When I first read the ( Zorro ) script , I was impressed by all the different styles , going from full drama to comedy and from action to romance , " Banderas said . " But I felt it was very important to give a strong accent to the comedy . " <p> Banderas grew up adoring Zorro , from reading Zorro comics to watching Guy Williams play the role on a Disney TV series . <p> But as an adult , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice drawn from Johnston McCulley 's stories in 1920s pulp magazines . <p> Banderas believed today 's viewers " should laugh with Zorro . In that way you invite people to participate with you in the adventure . Otherwise , Zorro becomes an arrogant guy with a sword in his hand . " <p> By helping to " push the comedy further than it was in the script , " he feels the film " plays well , because it makes the character more sympathetic . <p> " By the time this guy becomes a hero , we 've seen him failing , messing around , doing bad things . He begins as a naive , childish guy - very raw , uneducated and impolite . He learns what he needs from the master ( Hopkins ) , but even then he can still make mistakes . " <p> That includes his romancing of Elena , played by Catherine Zeta-Jones . She proves to be formidable with a sword herself . <p> The Mask of Zorro is Banderas ' first film since 1996 's Evita , the big-budget musical in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American movies that began with 1992 's The Mambo Kings . <p> Before that , Banderas had made dozens of films in his native Spain , some of which appeared on the U.S. art-house circuit , notably those of director Pedro Almodovar , such as Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down ! <p> The son of a policeman and a teacher , Banderas might have been a soccer player instead of an actor . But at age 14 he broke his foot . Unable to play , he began learning to act . <p> After Spanish stardom , the transition to American films was n't easy , in large part due to language . Banderas is still studying and learning English and speaks with a strong accent . <p> For The Mambo Kings , he knew little English and learned his lines phonetically . Now he has a speech coach " who 's very picky . " <p> " The English is coming along little by little , " said Banderas , 37 . " It takes time and work and sacrifice . At first it was really painful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool , an instrument , and I feel I can control it much more now . " <p> Yet his native tongue and accent have hardly been a hindrance in this country , Banderas said . <p> " People think I 'm trapped in America - that I can only play certain characters , " he said . " But the fact is , I was even more trapped in Spain . I 'd been in 34 movies in Spain and felt I was repeating myself . <p> " When I came here , I started doing different styles . I 've jumped from Interview With the Vampire , a horror movie , to comedies such as Miami Rhapsody to thrillers like Never Talk to Strangers to action movies like Desperado to a musical , Evita . " <p> When he was filming Philadelphia with Tom Hanks , Banderas said , Hanks told him " never to lose my accent , because it 's exotic and it 's good . He said as long as people understand you , you 'll have big possibilities in this country . " <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread his wings - even after a four-decade career that 's earned him the title of a knighted " Sir , " an Oscar for 1991 's The Silence of the Lambs and near-universal praise for his roles in English period dramas . <p> That 's all very nice , but for Hopkins , action films such as The Mask of Zorro are like a new toy , and he 's playing the game with a vengeance - so much so that he was limping and using a cane on this day in L.A. <p> " I 'm doing an action movie with Cuba Gooding Jr . ( Instinct ) , and I snapped my Achilles ' tendon in a fight scene , " Hopkins said . " Before that I was in The Edge , another physical role for me . <p> " So I 'm into the action movies now - and it 's great to break out of the mold of the stuff I 've been doing . " <p> For The Mask of Zorro , Hopkins watched videos of old films by Douglas Fairbanks , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Hopkins then worked with a fencing coach before and during the six-month shoot in Mexico . <p> He already had some experience with a sword from his stage performances . <p> " In Hamlet , in Henry IV , in a lot of Shakespeare plays , there 's a sword fight by the end , " Hopkins said . <p> His more recent English dramas , such as The Remains of the Day , " are nice , " Hopkins said , " but I 'm not that type of person at all . That 's why I live out here ( in L.A. ) . <p> " People asked how I played a butler in Remains of the Day , and I said I just walked around and spoke quietly . But really , I 've got as much energy as Antonio . " <p> He said the two actors ' chemistry and relationship was analogous to that of their characters . <p> " I 'm the older one and , like Don Diego , I 'm a bit of a rebel and a loner , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament . My character does n't sweat much , does n't push , because he 's done it all . As you get older , things become more effortless . " <p> Indeed , Hopkins gets impatient with younger actors who " walk around mumbling , muttering and shuffling . Just say the line . Tell the story and get on with it . " <p> He also feels as he 's gotten older that " the parts are more close to me . It 's much more fun now . <p> " But really , any role is just another version of yourself , of your own personality . I do n't understand what acting is all about . Just learn your lines , hit the marks and place the checks in the bank . " <p> Banderas has more of a youthful fervor - especially when discussing his new work as a director . He 's currently filming Crazy in Alabama , a dark comedy in which he stars with Melanie Griffith , whom he married two years ago . <p> " After 51 movies , I needed badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mirror , " he said . " I thought it was time for me to express myself as a filmmaker . " <p> Banderas said the production " is going great , but I 'm not a director yet . I have nine days to go . You 're not a director when you start a movie . You 're a director when you finish it . <p> " Then I have to wait several months to see if I 'm a good director or a bad director . " <p> Banderas described directing as " very revealing . <p> " When you 're acting , you sometimes lose your objectivity about yourself . Now , I can say to an actor , ' I know what the problem is - I 've been there . ' I 'm putting together all that experience I 've had . " <p> If the film does well , Banderas said he 'll direct another , but not for two or three years , since directing takes much more time than acting . <p> He also hopes to play more roles such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obligation as a Spaniard , " he said . <p> " I feel very happy if I am representing the Spanish community for the good things I do . It 's a responsibility I want to put on my shoulders . " <p> TYPE : Movie Review
