The night before I receive the phone call that divides my life into before and after , my face swells in an allergic reaction to a skin cream , then blisters and chaps . I am at a health spa in Southern California , a place where wealthy older women go to rest and rejuvenate , where young matrons snap their bodies back into shape after pregnancies , where movie stars stretch out on massage tables in private Japanese gardens , offering their smooth backs to the sun . I am none of the above , and for the past three days , since arriving at the Golden Door , I have often paused amid cacti and rock gardens to wonder what , exactly , I 'm doing here . I am twenty-three years old , and my life has become unrecognizable to me . I have slid slowly into this state the way one might wade into an icy lake , dipping a toe in at first , then wincing , pushing past all resistance until the body is submerged , numb to the cold . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with honey , I am sitting cross-legged on my bed , listlessly flipping through the pages of the San Diego Herald , staring out the sliding glass doors at my private patio . I am upset about my face , which is itching and beginning to blister . My eyes are slits . I have never been allergic to anything before , and am worried that this rash might spread down my neck and across my chest , causing me to swell inside , my body choking on itself . " Hello ? " " Dani , it 's Aunt Roz , darling . " " Hi , Roz , " I respond , confused . This aunt , who lives in suburban New Jersey , is not someone to whom I 'm particularly close , and she would have no reason to know that I am at this health spa , much less track me down here at the crack of dawn . Though it does n't occur to me to be frightened , though no alarm bells ring in my mind , I watch as my thighs begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm calling because --  " She pauses , speaking very slowly , as if to an imbecile . " The first thing you should know is that everything 's all right , " she says . And then , " Mother and Dad were in an accident . " " What kind of accident ? " " In their car , they --  " " Where were they ? Where are they ? Why are you calling me ? " " Now , Dani , if you 'll just slow down --  " She keeps repeating my name , and she says it the way I hate , the way my mother 's family has always said it , with a sort of pseudo-classy soft " a , " as if we 're from England , not New Jersey . There is an edge to her voice , as if she 's somehow holding me accountable for being on the other side of the country at a moment like this . She thinks I 'm a fuckup , a college dropout , a high-class drifter . " They 're both in intensive care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital , in Summit . They were driving home from your mother 's office last night --  " " Last night ? " " It was late -- there was nothing you could have done --  " I file this away somewhere , under miscellaneous family insanity . I am my mother 's only child . My father has a daughter from his first marriage , my older half sister , Susie , who lives in New York City . " Has someone called Susie ? " " No . " Jesus . " How did you find me ? " " Your mother gave me the name of the place you 're staying . " " So she 's conscious --  " Aunt Roz snorts , actually snorts into the phone . " Dani , your mother has two badly broken legs . Her tibia , her femur --  " Roz is a doctor 's wife -- the kind who thinks her marriage license includes a medical degree . Her husband , my uncle Hy , is a surgeon , and my favorite family member . I may be speaking to the wrong person . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . My voice has begun to shake along with my legs . Hy will tell me the truth . His hoarse , pipe-smoking voice will soothe me , tell me this is n't as bad as it sounds . I look wildly around my room at the sliding Japanese screens , the elegant , lacquered breakfast table upon which a fan has been set , detailing my day 's activities : 9 A.M. aerobics , 10:30 stretch ' n ' tone , 12:00 massage . " Uncle Hy is with the doctors . " " How 's my father ? " " He 'll be fine --  " Roz says flatly . " Not a scratch on him -- and he was n't even wearing a seat belt . It 's your mother you should be worried about . " I do n't stop to wonder why , if my father is fine , he is n't the one calling me in Southern California . My brain has gone numb , my instincts taking over . I will find out what has happened to my parents one small , manageable blow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " I say , calculating how long it will take to get to the San Diego airport . " Good idea , Dan , " says Roz .  - -   - -   - -   - -  I sit on the edge of the bed and dial a number in New York . There is a high-pitched buzz in my head : sounds , thoughts , language itself distilled into a single note of terror . I float out of my body and watch myself from a corner of the ceiling ; this is something I do often -- watch myself as if my life were a movie , as if I were only acting a role in this moment , as if it can be played back , cut , edited later . His office phone rings once , twice , then is answered by his secretary , Marie , a woman who knows me -- and my role in his life -- well . " Mr. Klein 's office --  " Her voice is low and sexy , modulated within an inch of its life . " Marie , it 's Dani . " " Dani , how are you ? How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all straight : wife , daughters , girlfriend . " Is he there ? It 's an emergency . " She puts me on hold and I close my eyes , try to quiet the buzzing in my head . My heart is skipping beats , thumping irregularly in my chest . Years from now , when this happens , I 'll wonder if I 'm having a heart attack . But at this moment in my life , at twenty-three , I think I 'm indestructible . I figure I have until I 'm thirty . At thirty I 'll expire , like a bright flame burning itself out . " Hello , cupcake . " Lenny 's voice pours through the phone lines , across the country , into my ear . The last time I spoke to Lenny was three days ago , when we were staying in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Hotel , and we had such an ugly fight that I asked him to leave me alone for a few days -- and he actually did . " Lenny , something bad 's happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking off the possibilities . Something bad could mean virtually anything at this point : police , drug bust , vehicular manslaughter , God knows what . " My parents -- were in a car crash -- it sounds pretty serious --  " The words are coming in gulps of breath . Saying it out loud , saying parents and car crash in the same sentence , saying it to Lenny Klein -- it 's all too much . My system is shorting out , and suddenly I 'm panting . " Honey , do you have any kind of bag , " Lenny says gently . " A paper bag , a plastic bag --  " " What for --  " " Just do what I tell you . Do you have the bag ? Hold it over your nose , and take some slow , deep breaths . In and out ... in and out . Good girl . " I hold a piece of Saran wrap with bits of grapefruit still clinging to it over my nose and mouth , improvising a bag , and try to do as I 'm told . I catch a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in gray sweatpants and a sweatshirt , my hair pulled back in a ponytail , my face red and swollen . " I 've got to get back , " I say . " Could you have Marie get me on the next flight out of San Diego to Newark ? " " Easier said than done . " " What do you mean ? " " There 's a fucking blizzard in New York , " says Lenny . " They 've closed the airports . "  - -   - -   - -   - -  I grew up in an Orthodox Jewish home , a home where Sabbath was observed , my father wore a yarmulke , and we kept meat and dairy separate , according to religious dietary laws . Though I 've strayed far from that home , in moments of pain , or shock , Hebrew words fly into my mind like a flock of blackbirds , foreign and unintelligible . They ride the crest of memory -- these words and prayers -- a whole other language I once spoke so fluently I even thought in it , and now no longer understand . Sometimes I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key . Other times , I think it 's accessible if only I know where to look : a language within my language , a heart within my heart . So when I get off the phone with Lenny and dial my half sister 's office number in New York , there is a tune drifting through my head , a prayer sung at the beginning of Sabbath services . Avinu Malkenu , Harenu v'anenu ... I have not attended shul since leaving for college six years ago , at seventeen , but no matter . I can identify the song , sing every syllable the way , as a teenager in the 1970s , I knew every Springsteen lyric . Susie , a psychoanalyst , is in session . Her machine picks up , and for a split second I almost blurt it out -- Dad and Irene were in a car crash -- but then I think of my half sister sitting in her office in Greenwich Village , surrounded by the accoutrements of her life : volumes of Freud , Oriental rugs , framed Ferenczi letter , burgundy velvet analytic couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her long wavy blond hair almost to her waist , a patient lying on that couch . I say it 's urgent , to call back the minute her session ends . If I am twenty-three , Susie is thirty-eight . She is a grown woman , certainly more grown than I am . She is an esteemed shrink , author of a book on schizophrenia , exotic traveler , and recently divorced from her psychiatrist husband . Her life , at least compared with mine , is sane and stable . Still , I somehow feel protective of her . I want to hold back the tide . She would say it is projection -- that it is myself I am trying to protect here , flinging up my arms , shielding my face from the shards of a life swirling around me like broken glass . I try to imagine my parents , but have virtually no information to go on . Which car were they in ? My father 's little sporty Subaru ? My mother 's Audi 5000 ? Where did it happen ? What , exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , at this very moment , whether my parents are alive or dead , in critical condition or just a bit banged up ? Lenny said there 's a blizzard . Was it the weather ? Did their car skid off the highway ? Were there other cars involved ? I squeeze my eyes tightly against it all , but the images churn , they do n't stop . I want a drink , a pill , anything . I methodically dig my nail into the palm of my hand . I want to move the hurt . I do n't know how long I sit there -- a minute ? an hour ?  - -  before the phone rings again . " Dan-Dan ? " It 's my uncle Hy . Talking to Roz made me numb , talking to Lenny made me hyperventilate , and talking into Susie 's answering machine made me mute . But hearing Hy 's voice , filled with love , and with something else -- something I ca n't yet identify -- makes me weep . " God , Hy , what 's going on ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always counted on to know . I decide to take it a parent at a time . " How 's my mother ? Roz said she has broken --  " " Dani , your mother may never walk again . " A door slams shut inside me , then another , then another . " And my father ? " " We do n't know what 's wrong with your father . " " Where is he ? " " He 's in a coma , Dani . " " What happened ? " I whisper . " He passed out at the wheel . It may have been a stroke -- we just do n't know . " I finally recognize the unfamiliar note in Hy 's voice : he 's treating me like an adult , telling it to me straight . " Get home , " he says . " Get home now . "  - -   - -   - -   - -  It 's ten in the morning . My best bet seems to be the red-eye out of LA , which does n't take off for another thirteen hours . Lenny arranges for a limo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie book me on three afternoon flights to New York , just in case . I even try Boston and Washington , but it seems this blizzard is blanketing the entire East Coast . Lenny Klein is a man who can make virtually anything happen -- that is , anything money can buy : center-court seats at the U.S. Open , oceanfront villas on the Cote d'Azur , Cuban cigars that arrive each month wrapped in plain brown paper -- but he ca n't cut a path through a snowstorm . He has been known to charter private jets when commercial airlines did n't conform to his schedule . But all the money in the world wo n't get me home faster . No planes are landing anywhere , period . The limo -- stately , elegant , dark blue -- pulls up to the gates of the Golden Door . Everything Lenny does falls just to the south side of flashy . It 's the mid-1980s after all , and flash is in the air , but as my mother has put it , Lenny has taste . " After all , he chose you , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same category as his vintage Ferraris , his homes in Bedford , Jamaica , Martha 's Vineyard . Lenny is a collector of fine things , and I am a thing . A girl in Lenny 's girl collection . I guess my mother feels that if I have to be carrying on with a married man , at least I 'm doing it with somebody rich and powerful , somebody who will show me the world . I fold myself into the back of the limo , my single piece of luggage in the trunk . In the back of the limo there are assorted tapes , a sound system , and a telephone . What there is not -- what I had been secretly hoping for -- is a crystal decanter filled with something amber : scotch , brandy . I need to sedate myself for the three-hour drive . My body has not stopped shaking . I think about my mother and shudder at the degree of impact it must have taken to snap a thigh bone in two . Try as I might to imagine her with shattered bones -- Hy mentioned both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as indestructible . A therapist once told me my mother reminded her of Mary Tyler Moore in the film Ordinary People . She is angular , energetic , fiercely private , imperious . How is she handling being flat on her back , in traction , at the mercy of doctors , nurses , and order-lies ? Is she telling them what to do ? My mind zings back and forth between my mother and my father -- the words coma , femur , critical , stroke forming , dissolving , then forming again -- as we pull away from the Golden Door and head north to Los Angeles . I summon up my nerve . " Is there any scotch back here ? " I ask the driver . The bright morning sun is muted by the tinted windows . " No , ma'am , " he answers , then pauses . " Would you like me to stop at a liquor store ? " " No , that 's all right , thanks . " It is the first time in my life I have been called " ma'am . "  - -   - -   - -   - -  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact of motion itself is a relief . We are going somewhere -- moving fast in the wrong direction . I should be heading east on a plane right now , circling above Newark airport , waiting for a break in the sky , a small ripped-open seam that would allow us to land . I snap a Carly Simon tape into the cassette deck , lean my cheek against the cool dark leather as the car fills with the opening drumbeats of " You 're So Vain . " The car phone rings . It 's Susie . I had given her the number when she called me back at the spa . " Dan , it 's me . " Months sometimes go by without any communication with my half sister . I have no idea what she thinks of me -- if she thinks of me at all . I always feel small around her ; small , and stupid . I have looked up to her all my life . On top of being a shrink , she 's a serious classical pianist who has studied for many years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nocturnes , watched her graceful fingers flying over the keys , her brow furrowed in concentration as she transformed notes on a page into something that moved me . I have also studied piano since I was a child . I wanted to be like Susie . I have perfect pitch , and the music always came easily to me , but by the time I was in high school the last thing I wanted to do was spend long hours practicing alone , and so I tried out for the cheerleading team instead . " Where are you ? " she asks . I look out the window at the arid landscape of Southern California . Heat waves rise up from the blacktop of the freeway . Billboards advertise condominium developments with names like Hacienda del Mar . " I do n't know , " I answer . " Where are you ? " " I just got to Jersey . " " What 's going on ? " " Well , Irene 's going to be okay . She looks awful -- like a caricature of someone who has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Susie 's voice is harsh and flat . As usual , my half sister minces no words . She 's furious that no one thought to call her until I did -- that my mother 's family seems to have forgotten that she exists . The trouble between Susie and my mother goes back nearly thirty years to the time my parents first started dating each other . She 's a phony , nine-year-old Susie told my father . Do n't marry her . They have barely tolerated each other over the years -- each has wished the other would disappear ; my mother could be at death 's door and Susie would probably perceive her as all right . " I called Shirl and Harvey , " says Susie , referring to my father 's younger sister and brother . " I think they 'd better get here . " I squeeze my eyes shut . " Do you think --  ? " I ca n't bear to say the words . Since I 've been old enough to contemplate loss , I have imagined losing my father . Whenever we have been together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the last . Though he is a bear of a man , an imposing figure , really , I have seen him as physically fragile , vulnerable , picturing a fatal heart attack , an embolism , a stroke -- my father falling like an old heavy tree to the pavement on Wall Street , where he works , or while walking to temple on a Shabbos morning . " The doctors are asking me what medication Dad 's on , " says Susie . I think of the possibilities : Valium , Percodan , Codeine , Empirin . My father pops painkillers like Tic Tacs ; he has suffered from chronic back pain for as long as I can remember . In the center of our breakfast table back home , on a lazy Susan where most people might keep cereals he has collected an impressive array of plastic bottles , each prescription written by a different doctor . " I do n't know what he 's taking , " I say . " Why do n't you ask Irene ? " It is a function of my relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her presence . I am trying to ally myself with her , to let her know that I understand . " Irene 's stoned , " says Susie . " They have her on painkillers up the wazoo . " My head feels as if it 's going to explode . My mother stoned is another in a series of impossible images . My father , comatose . My psychoanalyst half sister , my father 's sister and brother , and my mother 's suburban New Jersey relatives convening in a hospital corridor , pretending to get along . The rifts between my mother and my father 's side of the family are deep . They go back at least ten years , to the time my father 's sister , Shirl , had the flu and did n't attend my Bat Mitzvah . My mother was certain Shirl did n't have the flu and was n't coming because she did n't think the service would be religious enough . The night before my Bat Mitzvah , my mother called Shirl psychotic and hung up on her . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sucks . " " Am I going to be able to get home ? " " Eventually . " I close my eyes and count to ten . I want to scream at her , tell her to stop answering me in monosyllables , that I 'm her sister , not her patient . I want to cry out for help -- to let her know that I 'm only pretending to be a grown-up , that in fact I 'm a complete and total mess . But perhaps she knows this already . " I 'd better go , " she says . " The doctor just came out of the ICU . " " Okay . " We are both quiet for a moment . " Susie ? " " Yeah ? " " I love you . " We are two only children , raised by different mothers , fifteen years apart . Half sisters , connected to each other by half promises and half lies . But today we are all each other has in the world -- and the man who connects us is fighting for his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but there is static , and we are disconnected.  - -   - -   - -   - -  My parents had three previous marriages between them . My father married Susie 's mother when he was in his early twenties . It was a marriage that worked on paper . Early photographs of the two of them show a young , happy if slightly baffled-looking couple on the beach in Miami or playing shuffleboard at resorts like Kutchers and Grossinger 's . But underneath her proper Orthodox surface , my father 's first wife was a rebellious , intellectual spirit , and he had no idea what to do with her . Where he came from , women did n't aspire to more than a comfortable family life and perhaps some volunteer work at the temple sisterhood . After Susie was born , the couple stayed very involved with both sets of in-laws , spending Shabbos dinners either at my father 's parents ' house on Central Park West or at his in-laws on Fifth Avenue . My father was on the road half the time , traveling to a small town in Virginia , where he was overseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would shut down the mill for good , and lend my father the money to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange . But back then , my father 's traveling must have taken its toll . When he was home , he and his wife fought viciously , or lapsed into tense silences . Still , my father may not have grasped or understood her growing frustration and disenchantment . When Susie was six , my father returned from a business trip to find an empty apartment , with only his clothes left hanging in the closet . His wife , daughter , and all their belongings were gone . There were rumors , of course , that she had run off with Susie 's pediatrician . This kind of thing just did n't happen . In Susie 's class at Ramaz , an Upper East Side yeshiva for girls , she was the only child of divorced parents . My father waged a custody battle for Susie , and won ample visitation rights : Wednesday nights , every other weekend , and Jewish holidays . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates all over town . He was already becoming a tragic figure of sorts , ditched abruptly by his flighty , good-for-nothing wife . On the weekends he had Susie he sometimes took her to resorts in the Catskills , where they 'd play a game : he 'd go out on dates with young women , and Susie would narrow her little six-year-old 's eyes and give him her opinion . For his second wife , he chose another daughter of a privileged Orthodox clan . Dorothy Gribetz was a lovely , sweet-natured girl , and according to everything I 've ever heard , my father was crazy about her . So was Susie . He proposed , she accepted , and plans for a wedding were set in motion . It was n't until the night before their wedding that my father 's best friend told him a rumor that had been whispered throughout the Orthodox community : Dorothy had Hodgkin 's disease , which in those days was a terminal illness . She did n't know it -- her parents had kept it secret from her , and from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father paid a visit to Dorothy 's parents . Was it true ? Was she dying ? Yes , they told him , Dorothy 's prognosis was that she had a year to live . They had kept it from him because they saw how happy he made their daughter , and they wanted her to have that happiness , even if only for a short time -- even at the expense of his own , and of Susie 's . I picture my father now , standing beneath the chuppah on his wedding day . He is not the father of my memory , but of my imagination : he is a young man -- perhaps he is thirty-two -- but his eyes are already old . He turns to watch his bride walk down the aisle . She is a vision of innocence in her simple white gown . This should be the happiest day of his life . His eyes sting as she moves toward him , flanked on either side by her parents , and his heart is hollow . He is watching himself become a widower . He looks around the shul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will all be gathered here again in the not too distant future , that he and his bride will be together one last time in this sanctuary : he in the torn black clothes of mourning , she in a plain pine box . I grew up absorbing my father 's sadness without knowing where it came from . Sometimes he just disappeared . Not like other fathers -- fathers I heard about , who drove off in their cars and never came home again -- but just faded , as if he could n't really be there , not all of him . He would be sitting in a lawn chair smoking a Camel , and all of a sudden his eyes would grow vacant , his mouth would crumble , and he would stare off into the distance . I would follow his gaze to see what he was looking at , but I never saw what was making him so sad . I could n't make out the faint shadow of his first wife against the forsythia hedge in the backyard , holding a little-girl version of Susie 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the seashore , weak and pale in the final months of her life . There was defeat in the stoop of my father 's shoulders , or in the way he shook a few pills into the palm of his hand , then downed them in one gulp when he thought no one was looking . I thought that perhaps this was what it meant to be a grown-up ; that along with growing big and tall , the pinprick of sadness that was inside me too would spread until it covered my insides like a stain . I was sixteen years old before I heard about Dorothy . Susie let it slip -- when Dad , Dorothy , and I were upstate one time , she said -- and when I looked puzzled , she stopped and stared at me . You do n't know about Dorothy ? Susie was by then a thirty-one-year-old psychoanalyst , and on some level , she must have known what she was doing . Perhaps she felt I needed to know . There were already danger signs -- signs that I was fading fast myself . And then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my parents ' courtship and marriage has acquired a delicacy that has kept me at a distance , like an ancient hand-blown piece of glass that might disintegrate if I got too close . What I was told as a child was this : they first met on East Ninth Street in Manhattan , where they were across-the-street neighbors . It was a Saturday , the Shabbos , and my father was walking home from shul with nine-year-old Susie . My mother was returning from the hardware store , where she had just bought a hammer . Hammers and Shabbos are two things that do n't go together : for Orthodox Jews , the Sabbath is a day of rest , when no work is to be done , certainly not manual labor . So when my father met my mother , he must have known she was n't from his world . It is a story my mother has often recounted feverishly , slam-dunking the metaphor of the hammer . He knew I was n't observant . He saw the hammer . He knew what he was getting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising agency , who had left her first husband when she was thirty . My father was so taken with my mother that , the following Sunday , he pored over the Manhattan phone directory , searching for her . He knew only her first name -- Irene -- and her address on East Ninth . I can only imagine what he was thinking , the way his heart must have been racing . Who was the dark-haired beauty from across the street ? She looked to be in her early thirties . What had she been through ? Why was n't she wearing a wedding ring ? Why was he tracking her down despite his better judgment ? He ran his finger down each column in the White Pages , looking for Irenes or the initial I on East Ninth Street until he finally found her in the F 's , under Fogel , a surname left over from her first marriage . In a photograph of my parents I have hanging over my desk , they are walking down the aisle of Young Israel of Sixteenth Street on their wedding day .

Their arms are linked as they walk together toward the chuppah , and my mother is smiling triumphantly at whoever is taking the picture , a thin cloud of netting floating over her face . My father is smiling too , but now , if I look beyond the smile , I see that he is haunted . There are ghosts in his mind , ghosts swirling all around my father and my mother in the moment before they take their vows . I am not yet born , and there is already a piece of my father that is dead .  - -   - -   - -   - -  I am drunk , halfway home . Or rather , I should be drunk , but nothing seems to be working : not the two vodkas I had in the airport bar , not the bad airplane wine I have been drinking since takeoff .

I always drink on airplanes -- I consider them a sort of time-free zone , an endless cocktail hour . Besides , I 'm terrified of flying , and after a few little bottles of Smirnoff and cans of Mrs. T. 's Bloody Mary mix , I can usually forget that I 'm in the air , at least for a little while . Forgetting is what it 's all about -- forgetting that I 'm twenty-three years old and have nothing to show for it . Once I 've had a few drinks I can convince myself that I have a lot to show for it . Who needs things like college degrees , nice hometown boyfriends , starter jobs at advertising agencies ?

Retracing my steps has not felt like an option . I have run faster and faster in the wrong direction , eyes squeezed shut , hoping that somewhere along the way the road will loop around again .

As far as my looks go , I am seething with insecurity , a bottomless pit into which compliments fall for a brief , shining moment , then disappear . The whole notion of physical beauty has grown increasingly important to me as my intellectual curiosity has vanished . A few years ago I was studying music and literature at Sarah Lawrence , diagramming Mozart concertos and reading Tillie Olsen .

" my traveling companion asks . " No . " I pause and take a gulp of wine . " My parents were in a car crash . They 're both in intensive care .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I murmur , more to myself than to him . " Yeah . Well , shit happens , " he says . We bump through the air , and the FASTEN SEAT BELTS sign lights up with a ding . Usually this would be enough to send me into a panic , but not tonight . What are the odds of a car crash and a plane crash in one family in one day ? I turn away from my traveling companion and cover myself with a thin airline blanket . My wineglass is empty , I wedge it between an airsickness bag and an in-flight magazine in the pocket in front of me . Shit happens . Is there some sort of hard-won middle-aged wisdom in that notion ? The captain announces that we 're experiencing some turbulence . I curl up in my seat , trying to find a quiet place in my mind where I can rest , if not sleep . I 'm afraid to drink any more . My head is spinning , and each lurch of the plane turns my stomach . Lenny has arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newark , and I 'm planning to go directly to my uncle Morton 's house in Summit , only a few blocks from the hospital . I try to conjure up Lenny 's face , but he fades in and out of focus : a thatch of dark hair , big brown eyes , a thick wrestler 's body gone soft around the middle . His most expressive feature is his voice , which is deep and raspy , a tool he uses to great advantage in the courtroom . Lenny is a name partner in one of the largest law firms in the city -- a firm whose other partners include three former U.S. senators . Fortune recently listed him as one of the top five litigators in the country . I suppose he also uses his physical self as a tool -- striding , pausing dramatically , rolling his eyes , raising his voice to a thunderous pitch or lowering it to a whisper . He used that voice to seduce me three years ago . I met Lenny Klein at Sarah Lawrence . He was the stepfather of one of my close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hoarse voice asking for me on the dormitory phone , he said he wanted to get together , something to do with Jess . Would it be absurd to say I believed him ? There must have been an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach , but I ignored it . I agreed to meet him one evening in the city -- and I agreed not to tell Jess . Her birthday was coming up ; I thought maybe he wanted my help in planning a surprise party . And when he picked me up on a prearranged corner in his white Rolls-Royce , and his arm slid familiarly across the passenger seat , just brushing the back of my neck , what was preventing me from opening the car door and getting out ? I was twenty years old , and the idea that a friend 's father -- a friend 's married father -- would try to seduce me was something I found unfathomable . And yet , at the same time , I felt thrust into a parallel universe , one I had never known existed . Everything I knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is , Lenny repelled me before he attracted me . I went through the motions that night , let him take me to an elaborate dinner where I consumed the better part of two bottles of wine , but I had no intention of ever seeing or speaking with him again . I would have some explaining to do to Jess -- or maybe she did n't need to know . After all , I thought that would be the end of it . A little adventure , an honest mistake . And even when he started calling me several dozen times a day , even when he drove to my dorm and parked his car outside , I held my breath , just praying Jess would n't walk by . He sent me flowers and cards -- the floor of my old dorm room was covered with vases of yellow roses , the constant faint scent of decay in the air . Another twenty-year-old might have called the campus police , filed a complaint . But secretly , Lenny 's attentions made me feel like the most special girl in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of years back . I watch the tail end without headphones . The actress they cast looks a whole lot better as a Russian spy than I ever would have . I try to focus on the screen , but I 'm seeing double , so I close my eyes . Beneath my lids , another film is taking place : My parents ' Audi collapses like an accordion against a concrete highway divider , my father 's head is flung in slow motion into the steering wheel . His eyes close , glasses crack , lenses pop out from the impact . My mother screams , an unearthly sound , as her legs are mangled beneath her . Steam pours from the hood . All around them , giant flakes of snow drift silently across the nearly empty highway . I open my eyes , blink hard , and gasp for air . " You all right ? " my neighbor asks . He has moved from wine to Baileys Irish Cream , and his face is the color of sunset . " Yeah , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way down the aisle to the lavatory and splash cold water on my face , then examine myself in the mirror . The rash is getting worse . My cheeks are streaked with tears , and my lips and eyes are all puffy . The captain 's voice pipes into the restroom , announcing that we 're about to begin our final descent into the Newark area . The weather in Newark is a bracing eighteen degrees and we should be touching down at approximately six-fifty , local time . Before I return to my seat , I meet my own gaze evenly . The words of the Sh'ma , a Hebrew prayer , tumble through my mind . You are alone in the world , I whisper to the poor , pathetic girl in the mirror , preparing for the worst .
