UP UNTIL NOW , THE TARGETS OF BILL ( THE BOOK OF Virtues ) Bennett 's crusades have at least been plausible sources of evil . But the latest victim of his wrath  --  TV talk shows of the Sally Jessy Raphael variety  --  are in a whole different category from drugs and gangsta rap . As anyone who actually watches them knows , the talk shows are one of the most excruciatingly moralistic forums the culture has to offer . Disturbing and sometimes disgusting , yes , but their very business is to preach the middle-class virtues of responsibility , reason and self-control . <P> Take the case of Susan , recently featured on Montel Williams as an example of a woman being stalked by her ex-boyfriend . Turns out Susan is also stalking the boyfriend and  --  here 's the sexual frisson  --  has slept with him only days ago . In fact Susan is neck deep in trouble without any help from the boyfriend : she 's serving a yearlong stretch of home incarceration for assaulting another woman , and home is the tiny trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is applauding this life spun out of control . Montel scolds Susan roundly for neglecting her daughter and failing to confront her role in the mutual stalking . A therapist lectures her about this unhealthy " obsessive kind of love . " The studio audience jeers at her every evasion . By the end Susan has lost her cocky charm and dissolved into tears of shame . <P> The plot is always the same . People with problems  --  " husband says she looks like a cow , " " pressured to lose her virginity or else , " " mate wants more sex than I do "  --  are introduced to rational methods of problem solving . People with moral failings  --  " boy crazy , " " dresses like a tramp , " " a hundred sex partners "  --  are introduced to external standards of morality . The preaching  --  delivered alternately by the studio audience , the host and the ever present guest therapist  --  is relentless . " This is wrong to do this , " Sally Jessy tells a cheating husband . " Feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend 's boyfriend , " Any sense of remorse ? " The expectation is that the sinner , so hectored , will see her way to reform . And indeed , a Sally Jessy update found " boy crazy , " who 'd been a guest only weeks ago , now dressed in schoolgirlish plaid and claiming her " attitude had changed "  --  thanks to the rough-and-ready therapy dispensed on the show . <P> All right , the subjects are often lurid and even bizarre . But there 's no part of the entertainment spectacle , from Hard Copy to Jade , that does n't trade in the lurid and bizarre . At least in the talk shows , the moral is always loud and clear : Respect yourself , listen to others , stop beating on your wife . In fact it 's hard to see how The Bill Bennett Show , if there were to be such a thing , could deliver a more pointed sermon . Or would he prefer to see the feckless Susan , for example , tarred and feathered by the studio audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
