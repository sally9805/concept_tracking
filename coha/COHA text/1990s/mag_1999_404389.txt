// Danbala the celestial snake arches over earth in a rainbow . A slinky mermaid sounds her trumpet beneath the sea , exhaling glittery bubbles . A white cup teems with libation . These are some of the remarkable images of the drapo Vodou , the sequin flags of Haiti that gleam with the vivid narratives of the Iwa ( spirits ) they celebrate . If the gods of the Vodou ( or Voodoo ) pantheon have not only names , but also preferences as specific as brands of rum and perfume , the opposite was true for their craftsmen , the drapo makers who worked anonymously in Port-au-Prince until less than a decade ago . This anonymity changed when the Louisiana artist Tina Girouard , having encountered the sequin flags in her job as a Caribbean festival organizer , traveled to Haiti in ogo to identify the artists whose work expresses such profound optimism amid conditions of unbelievable hardship . In one of history 's rare successful slave revolts , the black people of Haiti rose up in 1791 against their French rulers , declaring their independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malevolent dictatorships of President for Life Papa Doc Duvalier and his son , Baby Doc . Vodou worship , an amalgam of transplanted West and Central African beliefs and elements of Roman Catholicism , with adaptation of the Catholic saints to local needs , was severely conscribed under the Duvalier regime . Limited to night , the ceremonies operated paradoxically as people 's theater and as a source of trench intelligence forthe dictators , who recruited the temple priests forthe Tontons Macoutes , the punitive police force . The Haitian people profoundly believe in the exchange whereby the faithful feed the hungry gods and win their protection . Papa Doc dressed the Macoutes in the costume of the peasant god Azaka , the farmer who wore blue jeans and a red kerchief and carried a machete . The brutality of such a strategy is self-evident : Duvalier saw to it that his people would find their own beliefs coming to haunt them in the form of literal goblins of darkness . The shimmering drapo Vodou , by contrast , are light-reflecting beacons . A single flag measuring 36 by 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work by at least three people . But the flag makers-illiterate Haitians-had never signed their works . For Girouard , who had participated in the feminist communal art scene in New York during the 1970s , identifying signature styles is as critical as " naming " the artists . A concern with conservation and education has been uppermost during her years of involvement with the sequin artists . Though the plethora of flags now in galleries across the United States attests to the popularity and the increasing commercialization of this form of bead art , the conditions in Haiti in past decades were such that old flags were looted from temples and sold to whomever appeared with cash . As Girouard describes it , " If a flag maker needs rent that day , he 'll sell his best work for rent . If he needs dinner , he 'll give you his masterpiece for dinner . " A tour of Girouard 's New Orleans studio yields a visual seminar on Vodou flags : the brilliant colors and graphic patterns of an Yves Telemak contrast markedly with the attenuated hues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary drapo makers have extended the conventional depictions of the Iwa into individual expressions is knowledge we owe to Girouard 's efforts to educate herself and circulate the information . For example , such design elements as border patterns were intensely important to the flamboyant production of Ceus St. Louis , who died several years ago . The younger generation , particularly Telemak , eliminated the border : the entire surface ofa Telemak cloth is covered by sequins and beads , reinforcing its assertion as an artwork akin to sacred icon painting or stained glass . When Girouard returned home to Louisiana from New York in 1984 , her role as board president of an international festival exposed her to Haitian music , to linkages between Haitian and Louisiana cultures and to an art form that she came to love passionately .

In the spring of 1994 , the flag maker Luc Daniel Cedor led a three-day Rara celebration , which began in Bel-Air and culminated in Croix-des-Missions , the village where Maya Deren , the dancer , filmmaker and author of Divine Horsemen : The Living Gods of Haiti-the 1953 ethnographic study of Vodou-once lived and became a priestess . That Girouard was invited to take part in Rara signals that Haitians honor her assistance to the sequin artists . She is godmother to the son of Antoine Oleyant , the master artist with whom she collaborated on one project before his sudden death in 1992 of a brain hemorrhage at age 38 . She is an " angel " to at least a dozen other artists whose works-the archival and the new-crowd her New Orleans studio . A resident of Haiti for long sojourns between 1990 and 1994 , Girouard was an advisor to the Port-au-Prince collection of Dr. Jacques Bartoli , who has loaned important works by makers such as Oleyant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Girouard 's personal collection is small , but includes masterpieces by Oleyant and important pieces by each of the artists she represents . " Lwa Lessons " is how Girouard titled the body of flags she created in homage to the Haitian pantheon as a way of honoring Oleyant 's death . A drapo Vodou that Oleyant and Girouard made together in early 1992 combines the snake and the mermaid in a 7o-by-40-inch textile , Under a Spell , Girouard 's first foray into depicting a Iwa . She had also been using sequins in her artwork to tell political stories . One flag depicts the sailing ships of Columbus arriving in Hispaniola in 1492 and a U.S. Coast Guard ship denying Haitian refugees entry to the United States in 1992 . Oleyant-whom Girouard recognized as a genius when she first saw his work-was the most aesthetically revolutionary of the Vodou flag makers . His compositional sense and use of color make his work instantly recognizable . Further , he extended the typical yard square ( three-by  --  three-foot ) format into a much larger field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols in an orthodox flag . In a single flag he incorporated both traditional and timely subject matter . His Hommage Haitien , 1991 , which criticizes the Haitian embargo , has won comparison to Picasso 's Guernica because of its symbolic and allegorical content . It is the centerpiece of Girouard 's collection-which she safeguards for her godson and , she hopes , for eventual repatriation to Haiti . The central figure of the work is Papa Loco , the temple guardian who was Oleyant 's spirit guide . Papa Loco is shown as a fighting cock ( the symbol preferred by ) ean-Bertrand Aristide , who was popularly elected as Haiti 's president in ago , then overthrown in a coup d'etat the following year ) , flanked on the left by a powerful bull representing agricultural bounty . The drapo calls for a successful return to democracy in Haiti . Oleyant depicted in a row the flags of countries united in the embargo against Haiti after Aristide 's ouster , which caused huge suffering to the people . The fiery tire is the " necklace " enraged Haitians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aflame in revenge for their savageries . Girouard emphasizes that Oleyant was a pacifist who wished his work to report the contradictions of a time containing hope and disappointment . When not in New Orleans , Girouard shares a Port-au-Prince studio with Georges Valris , a drapo maker who achieved a technical improvement when he used fishing monofilament instead of thread to make his flags stronger . She continues to import suitcases filled with sequins to Haiti and carry back artists ' new flags to New Orleans , where she markets them and also spearheads educational and curatorial projects on the subject . She is responsible for an exhibition that widened the story told by the Fowler Museum 's show of Haitian art ( which omitted Rara and did not include important Oleyant flags in Bartoli 's and Girouard 's collections ) , titled " Mystery and Mastery , " at the Contemporary Arts Center of New Orleans early last year . It demonstrated ethnographic links between Vodou Rara costumery , Yoruba beadwork from Africa , Native American dance costume and Masonic symbology . Cut-steel sculpture by Gabriel Bien-Aime , sequined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Morel and a stunning display of flags by Vairis , Oleyant , St. Louis , Telemak and others were included . Special attention was paid to commonalities between Haitian and Louisiana art forms-in particular , the beadwork of Mardi Gras attire next to extravagant Rara garments ; the tracing of political links like the sugar trail-the Spanish and French colonists ' northward conquest of agriculture-to which a constant stream of slaves was sacrificed ; and the fascination with cemeteries and altars . Girouard , like Maya Deren 40 years ago , is seen by her Haitian friends as a priestess-one whose efforts , like the $5 , ooo she loaned to Antoine Oleyant during the embargo to permit him to open a grocery store , enabled him and his family and friends to survive . At home in New Orleans with her shrine to Ezili Danto , the fiercely protective mother-warrior spirit , and her own flag picturing a couple sweetly entwined in the sugar cane , Girouard muses that " God works in mysterious ways-and the $5,000 l found for Antoine was one of the many minor miracles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What remains critical to an understanding of modern Haiti is that the experience of the people propels Vodou into a central role in their way of life . Visual symbols still do all the communicating for a majority of the citizenry . Though the people wish for the gods ' protection with health , harvest , love , fertility and death , the flags by which they honor the Iwas represent more than panaceas for matters of the heart or the body . The drapo Vodou bear witness to the Haitian people 's specific and terrible history , one that commands remembrance even as their luminous outlook demands praise . k Footnote * " Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou " concluded its three-year tour at the Museum of Natural History , New York City , january 3 .
