General Motors is reviewing all contracts with its 5,000 suppliers in search of ways to firm up quality while trimming as much as $4 billion , or 13% , from its $30 billion parts-and-supplies budget .

A GM supplier since the 1920s , GE makes 60 million tiny light bulbs every year for GM dashboard displays , trunks and glove compartments .
