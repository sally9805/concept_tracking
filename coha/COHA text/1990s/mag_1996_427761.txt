You met . You clicked . He said he 'd call . Then nothing . What happened ? // Okay , I admit it . Yes , I asked Lisette for her phone number , and , yes , I broke my promise and did n't call her following an evening of pleasant conversation at a mutual friend 's dinner party . Why did n't I dial those seven digits I 'm not sure , but truth be told , even as I was assuring her I would , I was already asking myself , Why am I taking this woman 's number ? Do n't get me wrong , Lisette is a sweetheart . She 's strong in character , quick-witted and not at all shabby in the looks department . Her flavor , however , runs more toward the conservative than my taste buds require . So despite a great personality and a body deserving of all the loving attention it could stand , I knew that the odds of my calling her were slim to none . And as the old joke goes , slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd call when I knew I would n't ? I do n't suppose the line " It 's a guy thing " would score me any points . Experts do n't know , either , readily admitting that any attempts to explain this bizarre male behavior is pure conjecture . Is it ego ? Fear of commitment ? Experts suggest it may be both and a whole lot more . One thing 's for sure : Since Ma Bell started laying down phone lines , phone-number collecting has been one of man 's favorite hobbies . " It 's all in the name of sport , pure and simple , " says George , 35 and a self-proclaimed phone-number collector from the Caribbean . Maurice , a 45-year-old record executive in Atlanta chalks it up to " social etiquette . " A 28-year-old corporate executive in San Francisco who prefers to go unnamed says accumulating numbers gives him a sense of control : " We ca n't communicate unless I initiate , " he explains . That 's an important factor to him , considering that he 's married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an ego boost , " explains Dr. Christopher Holmes , a clinical psychologist in Beverly Hills . " Many times men simply want to reassure themselves that they can still " pull " women . Their intention when they take the number is that they might use it , But for a lot of these men there is as much thrill in the hunt as in the capture . If a man can hunt down the phone number , he can go home convinced he would have captured the woman-if he was so inclined . " Maurice admits to taking an unused number or two in his day but insists his actions were sanctioned by his upbringing . Married and divorced in his early twenties and the father of a 17-yearold son from another relationship , he says asking for the number is simply etiquette . " My mother brought me up to be a gentleman . If I meet a woman at a dinner party , a club , through a mutual friend , whatever , and we have a nice time , I think it 's rude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . ' So I ask for the number because it 's a nice , polite , social way to end the evening . " Maurice 's quest for social perfection may rank as admirable , but Holmes does n't buy it : " It 's still ego , " he says . " The proof is , if the woman is unattractive to the man , that man has no problem saying very clearly It 's been nice talking with you . Maybe we 'll run into each other again some time . ' And that 's it . They wo n't ask an unappealing woman for her number out of any sense of moral or social obligation . " ( Maurice 's response : " The doctor 's got a point , because when it comes to numbers from a woman I 'm not attracted to , I ai n't taking it , do n't wan na be given it , and if she slips it in my pocket , I 'm trashing it before I get to the door . " ) Men also avoid calling because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , " Maurice says . " You can only call to chitchat but so many times . Sooner or later you 're going to have to do something . Nowadays a man can easily drop $100 on just a basic date . For me to pick up that phone , I have to feel she 's worth the investment . " George , a journalist from Guyana living in New York City , maintains that a woman who 's upset every time a man does n't call after taking her number is taking life too seriously . " It 's a game men and women play , and both sides understand the rules , " he says with an attitude that wo n't win him any popularity contests . " Taking phone numbers is a social ritual-a sport , if you will . You might want to see that person again , or you might not . Maybe you 're broke . Maybe you 're already in a relationship . Maybe you 're not in a dating frame of mind . Who knows ? You 'll either use the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The big deal , as I discovered when I finally called Lisette some three months after the fact , is that women generally take giving out their numbers a bit more seriously than the men receiving them . Blasting me with a cold front the North Pole would envy , Lisette told me that she had been disappointed by my disappearing act . She thought we had potential . She even hinted at the dreaded C word : commitment-a word I really was n't ready to hear . Here I was barely out of the gate , and she was already eyeballing the finish line . Janice E. Williams , a clinical psychologist who practices in New York City and New Rochelle , understands Lisette 's frustration . Williams says if men keyed in to women 's feelings , they would n't be caught off guard by the expectations some women place on the phone-number ritual . Citing jail , unemployment and education statistics , she asserts that the shortage of desirable men in the Black community is a major contributor to the number-giver 's heightened anxiety . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , " she says . " So when a woman meets a decent man and they hit it off to the point where he 's asking for her phone number , there 's probably a level of seriousness on her part that may not be present in the male . " Guys often ask for the number for no particular reason . Maybe they want it just because she made nice conversation . Or just because his mate is out of town . The woman is dealing with a broader range of issues . Maybe she 's a parent and does n't feel comfortable dating a lot of guys because of the negative impact that that would have on her child . If she 's single , and in her thirties , pushing 40 , then she 's watching the biological clock , whereas a man does n't give that much consideration . He can be an old father . So yes , there is a difference in intensity between the expectations of the man and those of the woman . " Another school of thought holds that racism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clinical psychologist in Brooklyn and an expert on the afternoon television talk-show circuit , believes that in the Black community , men who do n't call may be suffering the effects of a damaged psyche . " What I see in the African-American male is a lot of anger toward women , " says Gardere . " By collecting the number and never calling , men are using a very passive-aggressive way of punishing the sister and acting out their anger . Our actions are saying I 'm very upset that in this society you are accorded more privileges and are less feared than I am . ' So this is our way of humiliating the sister , of leveling the playing field a bit . " Even brothers who do follow up can find that first call unnerving . Without the controlled setting or the ambiance of the initial encounter , the man may feel pressure to prove he 's still the engaging fellow who took her number . Not every man 's confidence is up to that challenge . For whatever reasons men do n't follow up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet changing the rules may fall to them , because experts agree that , in general , men have little regard for the feelings of the woman on the receiving end . " It 's unimportant to guys , " Holmes asserts , " because they are n't in tune with the woman 's emotional system . They 're only in tune with their own . " Gardere agrees but says we need to understand where the insensitivity comes from . " There is no good or bad guy in these situations . It 's not that the brothers are evil ; they 're just behaving the way society has taught them to behave , " he adds . George , of all people , offers what may be a solution for some sisters who want to avoid falling prey to phone-number bandits like himself . " Get the man 's number and take the initiative , " he advises . " Are n't we now dealing with the liberated nineties woman ? They can call us too , you know . Why put yourself in a position where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution : If he does n't offer you his number or only gives you the one to his job , he may not really be available . ) Williams endorses a proactive approach : " If this is a guy you really want to explore and he offers his number , why not take it and call him ? " And for those who are still smarting from calls that never came , she advises women to pull together some close friends to sort out their feelings , gain clarity and reach closure . As for me , I know a few good brothers who are trying to do right . I hope I 've got it in me to become one of them . In the meantime , I 'd advise women to pay heed to Holmes : " Give out that number if you want , but acknowledge that it guarantees absolutely nothing . That 's the secret to protecting oneself Minimal expectations usually mean minimal disappointment . " Author Affiliation Wayne Edwards teaches media studies at Hunter College in New York City .
