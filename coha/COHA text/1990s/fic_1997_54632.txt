Strand knew his wife would soon notice how terribly old he was getting . It was only a matter of time . Lingering before his bathroom mirror , he catalogued the ravages . The yellow of his eyes , the white stubble growing up under , and out of , his nose , the saggy pouches of skin accumulating around his jaw . There was no mistaking it . He was pulling away from his wife , agewise . And soon it would be obvious to her . <p> Using the time platform had been a dirty little secret from the beginning , but at the beginning he had had it under control . Now he was spending as much time in no-time with Angela as he was back here in realtime with his wife . And it was turning him into an old man . He had no right to call himself forty-five anymore . He had lost track long before , but he was surely at least fifty by now , biologically . <p> He opened the medicine cabinet and took out his bottle of dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began combing it into his hair . A new irony occurred to him . His wife could save him . By noticing his aging , and accusing him of the adultery , she would put the stop to it that he could n't himself . His lover , youthful , life-giving Angela , was killing him , and only his wife could save him . <p> He finished , mussing his hair so it would n't look too combed . Downstairs his wife waited for him to join her in the large kitchen . He heard her . She was working already , piling the cotton shirts she and Strand would decorate with commercial logos today . All would be spotlessly clean , ready for the inking microbes they 'd prepared the afternoon before . She would keep stacking them , silently reproachful , while he read his newsclod . <p> Finally , dressed , showered , every hair in or out of place as required , he descended the stairs . <p> " Good morning " she said , too brightly . The further apart they grew the more blandly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without removing her hands from the long workbench . " How long have you been up ? " <p> Strand glanced at his watch , resisting the impulse to tell a meaningless lie . " Just half an hour , " he said . " Here , there 's plenty of time . Come and sit . " <p> " In a minute . " She continued stacking shirts . <p> Strand opened the front door , picked up the newsclod lying on the welcome mat , and brought it inside . He emptied it from its packet into the basin hidden under the table and leaned back in his seat , waiting for the enzymes to decode the day 's events and display the front page on the screen above the counter . The image that appeared , however , was unintelligible , shot through with colored streaks and abbreviated words . Strand picked up the packet and examined it . A muddy claw mark pierced the back . A cat or raccoon had eaten part of the news . Strand would have to go without his usual dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . He felt something like relief , in fact , as he dumped the spoiled news into a house plant 's soil . <p> " Angela , " he said , " did you make any coffee ? " <p> He winced in pain . He had called Miriam " Angela . " The name hung in the air , irretrievable . A disaster . <p> Amazing . He switched labels on bottles , spent thousands of dollars renting a room in no-time , and hid a time machine around the house . All this , all the subterfuge and contortion , only to call his wife by his mistress 's name . <p> " Yes , " she said distantly . " Here you go . " Strand fought to keep his features from simply melting into a lump on his face as she set coffee in front of him . Would she throw the cup in his lap ? Or had she somehow not heard ? <p> " Thanks , " he said , gulping , struggling to return her slight smile . " Uh , milk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcove . <p> " Yes , of course . " Another smile . She really had n't noticed . <p> He 'd gotten away with it . " No news ? " <p> He allowed himself a small lie  --  just an omission , really  --  as reward for getting through the crisis . " I was n't in the mood , " he said . <p> Strand had only been to the offices of NoTime , Inc. , once , years before , to set up the account when he and Angela began their affair . He 'd arranged then to have the daily code updates delivered to a storefront maildrop so Miriam would n't see them . When he left the house today Miriam showed little curiosity . His painstakingly rehearsed speech about a visit to the podiatrist had done the trick . <p> Since his first visit to NoTime , the company had grown . The offices were newly plush , the receptionist newly professional , her short dark hair styled and lacquered . Strand had flirted with her on his first visit . Today she was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and he sat across from the only other client there , a young man with a fashionable slush hat and heavy , tired eyes . A sagging rucksack took up the seat beside him . <p> The man was drawing a diagram on a scrap of paper on the table between them . Strand leaned forward to catch a glimpse . A problem in Radial Bowls . It looked like the man  --  little more than a boy  --  was sketching alternate aiming strategies , based on which of the 4,320 target regions his opponent seized . <p> " I used to play a little Radial , " Strand said , as cheerily as possible . <p> " I 'm the regional NCAA champion , " came the reply , in a distracted monotone . His voice was quiet . <p> " No . " <p> " Yes , " said the man , a little defensively . " I 'm Zip Lignorelli . " He looked up and stared at Strand . " I 've been playing for State since I was a freshman . Youngest champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were on the newsclod yesterday . You won  --  no , you lost a pasture . " <p> " I lost . I 'm losing four pastures to one . " <p> " What are you doing here ? " <p> Zip took a deep breath and leaned back . " It 's kinds stupid . Maybe I should n't be talking to you  --  " <p> " You rent no-time , " said Strand . The logic of it was obvious . " You work on your moves for Radial . You beat the time clock . " <p> " You  --  you a reporter ? " <p> " Relax . Your secret 's safe with me . Where do you hide the  --  " <p> Zip put a finger to his lips and smiled painfully . " Shhh . In the bathroom of the stadium . " He sighed deeply and looked at the ceiling , then back at Strand . " It 's not for the game , though . I got orals , for the baccalaureate , y'know ? Coming up . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . " Something had to give , right ? " <p> " That 's brilliant , " said Strand . " What 's the matter ? " <p> Zip sighed again , and cast his eyes down . <p> " You 're losing , " said Strand . " The other one , what 's her name , Andreyeva , she 's better . " He marveled at Lignorelli . So young , so wrapped up in sport . He wanted to urge him to forget the game and find himself a warm , loving female , but he was n't sure the student , with his flip manner and self-absorption , would know how . <p> " I 'll lose . I think you 're right . It 's either that or put my full attention to it and flunk the orals . " <p> " Does anyone know you come here ? What  --  " <p> Zip shook his head slightly and lowered his voice . " I 'm by myself . Came in today ' cause I wan na different room . " <p> Strand started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zip meant his room in the no-time hotel . <p> What a funny idea . The rooms , as everyone knew , were all alike . <p> "  --  I kinds want one with a window , right ? " The kid presented his case as though Strand worked for NoTime , Inc . " The room 's so plain , y'know ? No window , ca n't think . Going crazy . I could use just a little view . Even a fence or an access road or something ... " <p> " You poor guy , " said Strand gently . " The hotel is what they call a time-station , like a space station . It 's just hanging there , you see . Adjacent to our world . " <p> He took the paper and pen away from Zip and drew a little diagram : a building suspended in space . " It 's hanging out in no-time . There 's no view . If it were in the world , with a view , then time would be passing . Understand ? " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped his hands to his knees . " Well , that 's that . " <p> " Mr. Lignorelli , " the receptionist called out . " Mr. Axelrod will see you now . " <p> Zip looked at Strand with panic in his eyes , then obediently rose from his seat and stepped over to the desk . Strand , feeling protective , followed . <p> " I got ta , I mean , you can cancel my appointment , " said Zip . The woman narrowed her eyes . Strand remembered again how bubbly she 'd been when NoTime was a new operation . <p> " It 's okay , " he said . " I helped him with a question he was going to ask Axelrod . It 's all cleared up . " <p> The receptionist paused long enough to make sure Strand knew she thought this was improper . " I guess that makes it your turn , Mr. Strand . You 've saved yourself some waiting . " <p> Strand turned to shake hands with Zip . " Good luck , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good luck to you too . " He moved toward the elevators as Strand was ushered into Axelrod 's office . <p> " I had the idea , " said Strand , after he and Axelrod introduced themselves , " that I could somehow lure my wife , unawares , into a room in the hotel  --  perhaps in a sleep-state , or hypnotized  --  and get her to pass a couple of years . Do you follow me ? " <p> " You 're concerned with the age differential , " said Axelrod with a tight smile . " I understand you perfectly . " He passed a hand smoothly over his thinning hair . " It 's a very exciting suggestion , Mr. Strand . It also , if I read you correctly , constitutes kidnapping . " He looked down at his desk , then back up at Strand . " No , worse , I think . It 's really a variant of murder . " <p> " Oh , " said Strand , stupefied . <p> Axelrod pinched the bridge of his nose between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've accused  --  " <p> " Oh , no , " said Strand . " You 're absolutely right . I just had n't thought  --  it was a stupid idea . " Silent panic coated his nerves with ice . <p> Axelrod regained his poise . " It 's far from  --  " He coughed , then went on . " The ramifications often escape the layman , Mr. Strand . That 's what we 're here for . " He smiled again , this time with something like warmth . " Richard  --  may I call you Richard ?  --  you 're one of our oldest noncommercial accounts . We 're quite aware of your consistent use of your room in the hotel , and we want to help . I 'm surprised , frankly , that we did n't hear from you sooner . This type of thing is our third-ranking customer concern . " <p> " Oh , " said Strand again . The cold subsided , leaving lukewarm sweat . <p> " I 'm sure you realize that the effects you 're concerned with are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple , and you may find it disappointing . " Axelrod folded his hands . " Just because you 're keeping the room does n't mean you 've got to use it every day , Richard . Ease up . Spend less time there when you go . Because otherwise  --  " <p> Axelrod turned his palms outward in a gesture of helplessness . Strand realized now that he had been counting on Axelrod 's providing some answer , some counter-spell to NoTime 's original magic . He wanted a refund on his lost time , wanted everyone but him to spend ten years in the hotel while he caught up . He wanted to be young again , even young and stupid , like Zip Lignorelli , instead of old and stupid , like himself . <p> He was suddenly aware that his face was covered with tears . Axelrod was sympathetic now . " Here , " he said . He opened a desk drawer , brought out a mirror strewn with chamomile and handed Strand a slip of paper rolled into a tube . <p> Strand tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He mimed satisfaction for Axelrod 's sake and slid the tray back across the desk . <p> The waiting room was empty as Strand went to the elevator . He stopped at the table , hoping to retrieve the Radial Bowls diagram as a memento of his encounter with Zip . Instead he found a booklet with code updates for the NoTime hotel . It was the first Strand had ever seen besides his own . Apart from an unfamiliar account number at the top , it could have been his own . <p> Zip had left it behind . With a guilty look over his shoulder  --  the receptionist was busy with papers on her desk  --  Strand slipped it into his pocket , then hurried to the elevator . <p> Strand endured a lengthy dinner with Miriam , the whole time glancing surreptitiously at his watch . He and Angela had a date this evening , in the hotel , and he was eager for relief from the pressures of the day . Miriam would n't stop talking , either about new commercial clients they 'd already snared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some of the house plants ' leaves . <p> Before dessert , he carried the dishes into the kitchen . After arranging them on the dishwasher 's tongue , he picked up the compost bag and went out back . Once he 'd dropped the bag in the bin by the back fence , he crept into the storage shed , laid his wristwatch across the hibernating lawnmower 's muzzle , and unfolded the time platform hidden in an old box of automobile parts . He took the code update from his pocket and was about to punch in the figures when he noticed the strange number at the top of the printout . It was Zip 's . <p> Odd , he thought . What would have happened ? <p> Strand conceived uneasily that he would have traveled into the student champion 's past , or rather , dragged Zip into his future . For while Strand would have been perfectly able to jump back to his original point of departure and finish his meal with Miriam , Zip would have been forced to jump ahead to that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . You could n't use the hotel to go back in time . Zip would have walked into the bathroom of the contest hall and vanished for days . Strand would have destroyed the kid 's careers , both athletic and academic . <p> And it had nearly happened . <p> Strand repocketed Zip 's code , found his own , fresh from his maildrop , and entered the numerals . <p> He was transported instantly . But the room was empty . No Angela . <p> There was no being late for a rendezvous in the NoTime hotel , by definition . Angela 's absence meant she had n't used this code in the past and would not use it in the future  --  if she had she would be here with him at the start of the booking . <p> The day was a double loss , this new disappointment punctuating the earlier one . Strand felt profoundly old and tired . <p> He knew to return immediately , to avoid logging any useless time here at the hotel . When he materialized in the shed , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " normal " life after a clandestine sojourn in the hotel . His watch was warm from the lawnmower 's breath . He strapped it onto his wrist and went inside to have dessert with Miriam . <p> The next day Strand caught a bus to Zip 's college . His newsclod had said the match was suspended for a day at the request of the Lignorelli 's handlers . It was widely interpreted as a sign of growing desperation on the part of the beleaguered young champion . <p> Strand found Zip alone in his room , bent over a small replica of a Radial Bowls green . <p> " Why are n't you in no-time ? " asked Strand . He felt paternal toward Zip , as he had the day before . " You should n't have called time-out . It 's making a bad impression . " <p> " Does n't matter , " said the student , " I 'm not gon na be the youngest champion much longer . I 'll lose the match or end up older than Andreyeva . Or both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I stayed in no-time long enough to solve my problem I 'd be an old man . " <p> Zip seemed confused . " Your problem ? Huh ? " <p> Strand smiled . " My problem is I spend too much time in the hotel trying to solve my problem , which is the hotel . Forget it . Here . " He pulled out Zip 's code update . " You should n't leave this lying around . " <p> He explained how close he 'd come to doing something disastrous with the code . <p> " No , " said Zip , shaking his head . " We would n't be trapped going back together . I could 've jumped to another room , and from there come back to my own time  --  " <p> " Uh-uh , " said Strand . " No one can go from room to room in the hotel . It causes time paradoxes . Screw-ups , the future meeting the past . " <p> " Axelrod can , " insisted Zip . " He left from my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him do it . He said it was him only . " <p> " What was Axelrod doing in your room ? " <p> Zip shrugged . " Told me he visited all new clients . He wanted to talk about Radial . " The student snorted mirthfully . " I told him my problem , but he could n't even comprehend , let alone help find the answer . " <p> Strand felt suddenly self-conscious . Axelrod must have been drawn to the young man , much as Strand himself was . Strand pictured Axelrod showing off forbidden tricks with the time system , trying to impress the kid . <p> " Axelrod could have helped you , then , " said Strand . " He could have gone up the line , found someone who knew the outcome of the match . Told you what your opponent 's throws were . " <p> And he could help me , Strand thought . He could have gone into the future and found out whether Angela and I stayed together . Whether it was worth all this , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " said Zip . " Probably the outcome is I lose . I think there is n't any right throw at this point . " <p> " Well , it does n't matter , " said Strand . " Axelrod would never do it . He 's very unimaginative about the whole no-time setup . I 'd do it , but of course I do n't know the codes . " Strand recognized that he was vying jealously for Zip 's affections . <p> " I remember the number , " said Zip idly , as though it was n't important . <p> " What ? " <p> " Photographic memory . In grade school I was on TV for memorizing the entire Wichita telephone directory . I saw Axelrod type the code into the console . " <p> " What are you saying ? " <p> " The picture 's still in my mind . **27;1117;TOOLONG . A prefix , for overriding the computer . Then he types the code he wants  --  " <p> Strand felt a sudden thirst to know the hotel , to possess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time there , after all . It was his turf , as much as Axelrod 's . <p> " Let 's go , " he said . <p> " What ? " said Zip . <p> " Let 's go together , " said Strand , his excitement mounting . " We 'll find out about that Radial move . Who knows what we 'll find ? Hell , we might even find a room with a view for you . " <p> Zip raised an eyebrow , and did n't say anything . <p> " Come on , " said Strand . More than anything , he wanted to guide the boy to victory . He wanted almost as badly to put no-time to some other use , now that Angela had stood him up ; he wanted to renew his use of the hotel , make it mean more than just the affair . <p> Zip opened up the drawer of the desk and lifted out his time platform . <p> Strand had his in his briefcase . He 'd been thinking of taking it to NoTime Inc. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Strand 's . But the bed was stripped , the blankets and sheets in a pile at the foot , and from the bathroom came the sound of running water , and someone humming a meandering tune . On the dresser was a smoldering hand-rolled cigarette , and the room was filled with the sweet stink of marijuana smoke . <p> Strand and Zip turned and looked at one another , but neither spoke . <p> An elderly black man came out of the bathroom , holding a sponge and a sprayer bottle . He would have been fairly short if he had been standing up straight ; bent , as he was , like a question mark , he barely stood five feet tall . He opened his mouth in cartoonishly exaggerated surprise at seeing Strand and Zip in the room . <p> " You ai n't supposed to come in like that , now . This is one of the in-between times . I ai n't got the place made up . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " blurted Strand , marveling . They 'd discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You checkin ' up on me ? " <p> " Oh , no , " said Strand . <p> " You could be lyin ' , " said the man . " Lots of people lyin ' . " He looked at Zip , who shook his head in wide-eyed fear . <p> " But we 're not , " protested Strand . " Listen , do you recognize this man ? He 's a famous Radial Bowls player . He 's involved in a very important match  --  " <p> " I do n't know nothin ' about Radial , " said the man suspiciously . He went to the dresser and stubbed out the smoldering joint . <p> " It 's on the front page of the newsclods , " said Strand . " Everyone reads about it  --  " <p> " Oh yeah ? Well I ai n't seen any newsclod either . " <p> " What , " said Strand . " Do you and the other  --  the others who clean the rooms stay in the hotel all the time ? " <p> " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you saying you clean the whole place yourself ? There could n't possibly be time enough  --  " <p> " Time ? There 's plenty of time . And for every time there is , there 's a between time , like right now . Me ' n ' Yaller just clean it up when we ready . " He indicated the aging scrubhound that had shambled out of the bathroom after licking the fixtures . " Ai n't no hurry . " <p> " Where do you live ? " said Strand , confused . <p> " Oh , ho . " For some reason this was amusing . " Way do I live ? I live down the line a bit . " He jerked his thumb over his shoulder . " Same as all the rest , but I do like it back there . Feels clean and new . Ai n't no one sleepin ' in the bed before I sleep in it . " <p> " Uh , Strand ? " said Zip , strain evident in his voice . <p> " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildly affected by the marijuana fumes . " Well , I 'm sorry we intruded . We 'll just go and come back later . Some kind of slip-up , I suppose . " <p> " Okay , " said the janitor , shrugging . " I get it all clean up in a bit . Heh heh . So long . " <p> Strand realized the man took him and Zip for a couple . " Here , " said Zip . He 'd scribbled a new number onto a sheet of the hotel 's stationery . <p> It was the first time Strand had jumped from room to room within the hotel , and for a moment he thought Zip and the janitor had simultaneously vanished . But the bed was made . It was another identical room . <p> At that moment Zip appeared . <p> " Where are we ? " said Strand . " How did you get this code ? " <p> " It 's easy for me to extrapolate the numbers , " said Zip . " But I du n no where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least no one 's here . " <p> Strand was impatient . How could they learn anything in an empty room ? " Let 's jump again  --  " <p> " No , " said Zip , his voice high and squeaky . " I ca n't stay here anymore . This is getting too weird . " <p> " You do n't want to see the rest of the hotel ? " <p> " I never wanted to see the hotel . That 's your bag . Besides , I have a Radial move to make . " The student suddenly relaxed . <p> Strand felt bereft . He 'd secretly wanted Zip 's dilemma to be permanent , insoluble , like his own . To lead further into the hotel , not out of it . " You have a throw ? " <p> " More : a strategy . It came to me while I was working with the codes , instead of thinking of the game . It happens like that . " <p> " I understand , " said Strand , hiding his disappointment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Zip . " I 'm going to draw . " <p> Strand felt betrayed . " Should n't you try to win ? " Was n't that the point ? But he knew he was naive about Radial . <p> Zip smiled . " I 'm at the top of my game . Or maybe I 'm fading ; same thing . " He shrugged . " Even if I won this match , I 'd lose the next , y'know ? I should just get on with my life . " <p> Strand began to see . " So if you draw , you retire without losing ? " <p> " In a sense . And , " here Zip actually grinned , the first time Strand had seen him truly happy , " you helped me . Since you told me before that all the rooms are identical , right ? Like the Radial slices , where we move from pasture to pasture , but they 're all really the same . The way the balls lie now  --  it 's like this : I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 'll have to defend against . And her only possible roll will put me in the same jeopardy , so I 'll be forced into one of two throws . One is ordinary , and after that I 'd need a new strategy  --  and there just is n't one . But the other will force her into the same defense . And then it 'll be a closed cycle , unless one of us aims badly on purpose : we 'll have no choice but to chase each other around the green , through all the slices , forever . Movement , but no true change . So I wo n't win , but I 'll have made my mark . " <p> Strand understood . It was something entirely new for the sport . He could even share some satisfaction at the idea . " And they 'll name the maneuver after you , I guess . " <p> " Probably . So thanks , y'know ? Maybe you 'll be famous with Radial fans , too . " <p> " Do n't , " said Strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Understanding lit the boy 's face . " Sorry . I did n't wan na  --  I mean , I guess you got enough troubles , right ? " <p> Strand relaxed . <p> " What will I do ? " he said . <p> " Here . " Zip went to the desk , and began scribbling out codes . " I can extrapolate codes from the pattern  --  " <p> " They ca n't all work , " said Strand . " The hotel ca n't go on forever . " Zip shrugged . " Maybe it 'll reject the useless codes . " He continued writing . " Here 's a few dozen . And here , if you want to go back , the return code , to my room . " He circled it twice . " Where you left your platform . " <p> Strand felt exhilarated and dumbfounded at once . He was free to roam the hotel . After years of jumping to a single room he was going to possess the territory , plumb its depths . <p> But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return code at the wall console . <p> " Good luck , " said the young man . <p> " Yes , " said Strand , but by then he was alone . He felt a moment of sadness , but it passed . There was n't any reason to sit in the hotel , moping . <p> He went to the wall console and punched in the topmost code on the list . <p> It was very much the same room again , with just one difference , a big one : two people sat on the edge of the bed , which was unmade , and neither of them wore any clothes . Most oddly , Strand knew who the two people were . <p> Angela and Axelrod . <p> " Richard ! " blurted Angela . She did n't make any move to cover herself . Axelrod , on the other hand , grabbed his pants from beside the bed and leapt to his feet . <p> " I do n't understand , " said Strand numbly . <p> " You do n't have to understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Where 'd you get this code ? " He sucked in his gut and fastened his trousers . <p> " Code , code , " said Strand . " Uh , it was on that rolled-up paper you gave me in your office . For snorting the chamomile . " Strand wanted to protect Zip , and this seemed an opportunity for a vicious lie . He wondered if it was vicious enough . <p> " That 's nonsense , " snarled Axelrod . " You should n't trifle with me , Dick . You 're under quarantine as of right now . " <p> " Quarantine ? " <p> " Time quarantine , Dick . What do you think you 're achieving by blundering into the hotel like this ? " <p> " Stop calling me Dick . " <p> Axelrod hurriedly buttoned his shirt and tucked it into his pants . " Listen , old man , " he said , stepping up to poke a finger at Strand 's chest , " you do n't seem to understand  --  " <p> Strand reared back , uncorking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivered a championship-caliber punch to Axelrod 's midsection . The younger man fell in a heap at Strand 's feet . Strand noted with satisfaction Axelrod 's bald spot , now quickly flushing pink . Old man . <p> " Oh , Jesus , Richard , " said Angela . <p> " Motherfucker , " gasped Axelrod from the floor . <p> Angela got up , still naked , and helped Axelrod to the bed . Strand watched , furious . It seemed to him that Angela ought to rush to him and plead out an explanation . But apparently she did n't agree . <p> " Okay , " croaked Axelrod , his arms wrapped protectively around his middle . " Now listen . You can run if you like , deeper into the hotel  --  it does n't matter . When you come out I 'll catch you and hang you by the balls . Understand ? " <p> " What if I never come out ? " said Strand . " What if I just roam the hotel for a while ? Kick everybody out , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll come out . Trust me . You can get it over with fast , or play it out . Either way I 'll get you . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " This is the future , Dicky-boy . You wanted to learn about the future  --  fine . But the future gets to learn about you , too . You fucked up , and you 've got about , ah , about two weeks before we catch you . " <p> " Two weeks ? " <p> " Tell him , Angela . " <p> Angela looked up from the bed guiltily . " I  --  I broke it off , Richard . Remember when I did n't come to the room ? " <p> " Yesterday , " said Strand firmly . <p> Angela shook her head . " Two weeks ago . We 've talked about it , only I guess you do n't know yet . I 'm sorry . " <p> " You  --  you do n't want to be with me anymore ? " Strand ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor , and now , only now , grew modest , reaching for a sheet to cover her breasts . <p> " What happened ? " said Strand . <p> She looked up , her expression pleading . " Oh , Richard . I went to Daniel 's office , about our problem . " She glanced at Axelrod , who nodded , then went on . " Just as you did . You knew as well as I did that we needed a way to stop . A way out . " <p> " And Daniel here offered you one . " <p> She nodded silently . <p> " You 're a married man , Dick , " said Axelrod . <p> Strand sagged . The air had gone out of his universe . " How could you tell I did n't know about the breakup yet ? " <p> " You turned in your platform two weeks ago , " said Axelrod . " Right after the breakup . Renounced no-time . So this bouncing around , this intrusion  --  it had to be before . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you turn in your platform . We 've got you pinned . We 're later than you . " <p> " So now I go back . To have Angela break it off . And then I wait around for the arrest . " <p> Axelrod smiled . " It certainly looks that way . " <p> " But no . That ca n't be right . " Strand realized how little Axelrod knew about the situation . " You 're only learning now . You do n't know what you 'll find when you jump back . Perhaps I 'll have vanished . Or perhaps  --  " He kept himself from mentioning Lignorelli 's platform . " Maybe by the time you come back I 'll own NoTime , Inc . I 'll have your job . You ca n't possibly know . " <p> " Not exactly , " said Axelrod . " Think it through . We 've seen you around and about the last two weeks  --  Angela had to have someone to break up with , did n't she ? You came back . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned down your location , which I 'll do as soon as we go back . In fact , I have a much better sense of how you spent the last two weeks than you do . Because for you they 're the future  --  unknown . " <p> " It 's true , Richard , " said Angela . <p> " So go ahead , Dick . Do your worst . " Axelrod was able to sit up straight now ; he shrugged Angela away and pointed an accusing finger . " Maybe you 're right , maybe you 'll own NoTime . All I know is you did n't own shit this morning when I left . You were n't even man enough to come up to the offices and confront me about Angela . You 'd been avoiding me . " <p> Strand looked to Angela . She softened her eyes and nodded sadly . Was she communicating something , offering some hope ? Or merely urging him to follow Axelrod 's sneering orders ? <p> " Go back , Dick , " said Axelrod . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strand punched in the next code from Zip 's list , and jumped . <p> The first thing he noticed was the banner stretched out over the bed , a fading printout that read : STRAND GO HOME . Then he saw the poker game : five grizzled , middle-aged men sitting around a card table . The table was littered with cigarette butts and disarrayed piles of poker chips ; behind it , the bed was strewn with delicatessen sandwiches . Strand felt something under his foot . He looked down . He was standing on a hat . <p> The men turned to face him . " Can we help you with something " said one . <p> " We 're all paid up for the room , " said another . <p> Strand was struck dumb . <p> " Hey , " said one of the others , in an exaggerated tone of wonderment , " you 're that guy  --  you know , the one Danny Axelrod used to talk about  --  the one who went crazy and got lost in the hotel  --  " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They gave up on you a long time ago . " <p> " I 'm not lost , " said Strand . " I 've been in the hotel less than an hour . " <p> " You ought to get in touch with Axelrod , " said the first man . " He does n't even know you 're still here . " <p> Strand took his foot off the hat . " Tell Axelrod to go fuck himself , " he said . " Tell him to stop playing games with me . " He turned and punched a new number into the console . <p> He jumped to the sound of laughter at his back . <p> The next room was empty . Apart from the banner again : STRAND GO HOME . <p> Strand saw now that Axelrod had jumped ahead and spoiled the hotel . There was n't anywhere Axelrod had n't already been . Strand had a sheet with twenty-some-odd codes , but Axelrod had access to the formula that generated codes to begin with . <p> And suddenly he understood something else : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , because that was all there needed to be . One room , extended endlessly through no-time . Suddenly the janitor 's talk made sense . All the various liaisons and retreats were played out not side by side in some vast , drifting hotel , but one after another in the same little room , the same little desk and bed . With an elderly janitor and a scrubhound to swab it out after each visit . <p> It rendered Strand 's desperation absurd . He 'd been struggling to inhabit a single room . <p> He suddenly felt a terror of isolation there , alone , a thin shell of cheap wallboard between him and the no-time . It was the loneliest place there could possibly be . <p> He could n't think of what to do . <p> Like Zip , he could n't go back until he came up with a move . His opponent , like Zip 's , sat and waited across from an empty chair . Only in Strand 's case his opponent was ruin , abandonment , and death . And Strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another code into the console . <p> A woman was standing on the bed , taping the new GO HOME banner to the wall . One end draped over a pillow onto the floor . <p> Securing one corner with tape , she turned and smiled . " Good to see you again . " She swayed slightly where she stood on the mattress , towering over Strand . <p> After a moment he recognized her . " You 're the receptionist . You work for Axelrod . " <p> She snorted mirthfully . " Axelrod thinks so . I mean , I do . But I was also waiting for you , and I 'm doing that for myself . And for you . " <p> Strand wondered how she could know he 'd be there now , then blurted , " You got the list from Zip . " <p> " I know Zip made you a list , and I know what codes he had to use as bases . It 's the same thing . " She shifted her weight and slid a drooping lock of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculator , though . Could n't do it in my head , the way he does . " <p> Strand sagged in relief that the boy was n't in league with Axelrod . <p> She spoke again . " Axelrod 's a stooge . He has nothing to do with your real problem . He does n't even know what it is . " <p> " He told me he could n't help me . And he wants to kill me . " <p> " Danny could n't kill a sick puppy . And he would n't need to help you even if he wanted . You 're not aging in no-time , baby , not like you think . " <p> He gaped . <p> " Think about it . How much time do you think you 've lost ? " <p> " Five years , I figure . " <p> She laughed again . " You figure , or you feel ? Look , you 've been a client for less than ten years , and you did n't start using the hotel a whole lot until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it adds up to about six months . " <p> Strand felt dizzy with bafflement and relief . " But my hair , the ... " <p> " Listen . You 're forty-five years old . Or maybe forty-five and a half . But that 's it . " <p> He sat on the edge of the bed , not caring if she looked down on him . " I feel so stupid . " <p> " Do n't . You 're not the only one to worry about that . It 's our third-ranking customer concern . " <p> " I guess I knew I was losing Angela , and could n't face it . " He started to cry . " I was using her for so long , and she never asked me to leave Miriam , and  --  " <p> The receptionist sat down on the mattress suddenly and pressed herself against his side . " She did n't want you to leave Miriam . If she wanted a man all to herself she would n't ever have been with you . " She snorted again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axelrod . " <p> " I 'll miss her , though . " <p> She grabbed his arm tightly . Strand felt her breath chilling the tear streaks on his face . " Maybe , but you 'll miss the rest of it a lot more . Did Angela herself need anywhere near the care you had to give to the planning , the slipping away ? " His tears had dried and her breath was hot on his eyes . " Did n't you panic the first time you noticed your watch was hours fast ? Did your wife notice it before you did , and ask you about it ? Did n't it feel great after you lied your way out of it ? And does n't it feel great now , every time that you take the watch off first , that rush of competence and secrecy ? " She breathed . " Some people just need that , and you got it with a woman instead of with , say , shoplifting like I used to . " She stopped , her chest heaving against his sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not noticing when he called her by the wrong name . " It did take a lot of effort to keep her from finding out . " <p> She got a pinched look around her mouth and inhaled sharply . After a moment he realized that she 'd succeeded at not laughing in his face . <p> " Oh , " he said . " Oh . " <p> " You 're not the only one to think that , either . " She smiled and released his arm . " So you do n't really have a problem , not like you thought . You just need to find another secret to play chase-me with . " She stood and pulled him to his feet , then kissed him quickly on the lips , pressing the length of her body up against him . She smelled lightly of sweat and hair lacquer . <p> " You 'll go back now , wo n't you ? " she said . <p> " I suppose so , " said Strand . Then he felt wary . " So you 've done your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> She laughed . " You should be more trusting . You and Axelrod are exactly the same , thinking everything 's cops and robbers . " <p> She stepped away and looked at him . " If you want , you can phone me at NoTime . It 's always me answering , or the service . Now get going , I need to finish this . " She grabbed the loose end of the banner and stepped back up on the mattress . <p> He hesitated . Her warmth lingered on his chest and legs . " But if I call you now , wo n't it be too early ? " <p> She faced him , laughing and swaying . " What do you mean by ' now ' ? What do you mean by ' early ' ? " She turned back to fussing with the banner . <p> Strand went to the console . <p> He started to punch in the return code , then paused , and substituted another code from the list . <p> A woman lay fully clothed atop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt a surprising surge of attraction toward her be/ore recognizing her dress . It was Miriam . <p> His nerves iced over , just as when Axelrod had teased him with the murder accusation . How could she know I 'd be here ? he asked himself . He tensed as he waited for her to turn and confront him . <p> As the seconds passed , however , she remained still , showing no sign of turning . He saw that she did n't know anyone had entered the room ; at the same time he saw her ribs heaving in noiseless sobs . On the bedspread beyond her sat several boxes of tissues . He knew the brand from her stockpile in the closet . He 'd never thought to wonder why she bought in bulk . <p> Used tissues littered the floor . He felt a brief twinge of sympathy for the janitor , before reflecting that Miriam probably was one of the easiest clients to clean up after . She 'd even brought her own towel to catch her tears on the pillow . The towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in months , that he 'd assumed had been thrown out . <p> Then he noticed that it was nearly new . <p> He punched in the code for Zip 's room , back in realtime . The eye of the world blinked and he was home . <p> The room was empty . Strand looked outside and saw Zip rushing away through the parking lot , off to make his throw . <p> <p> By Jonathan Lethem and Angus MacDonald <p> Jonathan Lethem was recently picked by Newsweek magazine be one of the Americans to watch for in the next century .
