As more than 10,000 participants from at least 80 countries gathered last week for the Sixth International Conference on AIDS , the spotlight was focused squarely on the victims of the disease . The meeting was staged in San Francisco , the epicenter of the epidemic , and held during the city 's Gay Pride Week , an annual festival that drew 100,000 homosexual men and women from around the U.S. AIDS sufferers helped write the conference agenda and delivered impassioned speeches about the extraordinary human cost of the disease . In fact , they stole the show from the hundreds of scientists , who exchanged information but had no breakthroughs to announce . <P> Much of the time , more was going on outside the Moscone Convention Center than inside . The streets were often filled with protesting gay activists , who demanded more Government money to help find a cure for AIDS and provide care for those afflicted . Said Paul Boneberg , head of a group called National Mobilization Against AIDS : " We have to take this opportunity to draw the world 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AIDS problem . People are dying , and these protests move policy forward . " <P> At times , though , the demonstrations generated more annoyance than sympathy . On Wednesday a large group of protesters outside the convention hall confronted a line of police officers in full riot gear . In the resulting scuffle , 80 demonstrators were handcuffed , loaded into buses and taken to headquarters to be booked on misdemeanor charges . ( They were all later released . ) After the arrests , some of the remaining protesters staged a march down Market Street , one of San Francisco 's main thoroughfares . The marchers stalled trolley buses in the middle of the street by pulling the vehicles ' rooftop poles away from the overhead wires that supply the vehicles with electric power . Another group briefly occupied a cable car , jostling passengers and posting in the window a placard bearing the slogan SILENCE=DEATH . By week 's end police had arrested and released more than 400 demonstrators . <P> No one can deny that AIDS victims deserve all the compassion and help that society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the toll is still mounting and the end of the epidemic is nowhere in sight . At least 600,000 Americans are infected with the virus , more than 136,000 have become sick , and some 83,000 of those have died . <P> But many public health experts fear the focus on present suffering may be diverting too much attention from the task of protecting those who could become victims . Billions of dollars have been poured into research aimed at finding a cure , but relatively little has gone into programs designed to stop the disease from spreading . The National Research Council , in a report released last week called AIDS : The Second Decade , declared that prevention efforts fall " far short of the magnitude of intervention needed .
