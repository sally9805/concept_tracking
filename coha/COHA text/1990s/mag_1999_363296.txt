More powerful than Microsoft ! Able to leap Time Warner in a single bound ! Why , it 's Yahoo ! In one breathtaking trading session , Yahoo went from being a glitzy dotcom to being one of the largest corporations in the world , surpassing hundreds in market value . And what had Yahoo done to earn the additional $40 billion in market cap ? Zip-o . Amazingly , the updraft was a bizarre offshoot of the company 's admission , after the close last Tuesday , to the elite Standard &; Poor 's 500 . <P> As I watched its astounding ascent from $212 , when the S &P; announced its newest pick , to $348 at the bell , I came to the somewhat sad conclusion  --  at least for a trader who thrives on identifying diamonds while they are still in the rough  --  that trying to game the S &P; may be the single biggest way to make money in this wacky market . <P> More than 20 million shares of Yahoo had to be purchased by the funds that run billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of indexing creates instant value overnight in a way that a takeover or a restructuring or an earnings surprise can never produce . <P> The folks at McGraw-Hill , who keep the averages , are a secretive bunch . They did n't explain why Laidlaw , an obscure Canadian company , got the ax and Yahoo got in . But one thing is certain . If this index is going to maintain its integrity as a diversified assemblage of our industrial might , there are more Yahoos ahead . They might not all have the same pop as Yahoo , in part because much of Yahoo is closely held . But because of the newness of some of the candidates and how much is owned  --  and not traded  --  by venture capitalists , the pickings here could be huge . <P> Right now there are more large-cap companies outside the index than at any other time in history , because of investors ' massive reweighting toward technology companies . Among those we consider potential admittees are JDS Uniphase , a $42 billion fiber optics company ; online retailing colossus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veritas Software , no Microsoft but certainly no slouch , with $28 billion in stock-market value . We wonder whether CMGI ( $23 billion ) or Internet Capital Group ( $28 billion ) can be kept out for long . Or how about Broadcom , or just created Red Hat , Sycamore , Juniper and Akamai , all with valuations north of $15 billion in their rookie year of trading . You have to believe that these companies would follow a Yahoo-like trajectory because of their thin floats . <P> Who might get the gate when these newbies claim S &P; seats ? Such well-known but decidedly no-tech companies as shoemaker Reebok ; Russell , the apparel company ; and car-part king Pep Boys . <P> But remember , if you decide to play , that we rarely know when the announcements will be made  --  these are closely guarded knightings  --  and the move , while swift on the upside , can be just as death-defying the day after admission . Yahoo , which traded millions upon millions of shares at $348 at the moment of admission at 4:01 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending the week at $353.30 . <P> Typically , this kind of rapid-fire turnover is unrewarding because of transaction costs and taxes . But sometimes it is worth sharing a 130-point one-week gain with the broker and the taxman.
