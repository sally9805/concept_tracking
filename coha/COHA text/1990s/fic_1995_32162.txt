ONE I do n't want your crappy little company ! " said Dan Randolph . " The hell you do n't ! " Willard Mitchell snapped . Dan gave a disgusted snort and leaned back in the stiff unpadded chair . Mitchell glared across the table at him . The two lawyers , seated beside their clients , shifted uneasily in their chairs . The room was windowless , deep underground , without even a video screen on the wall . Just bare lunar concrete lit by glareless fluorescents set behind the ceiling panels . Technically , the chamber was not a cell or even an interrogation chamber . It was a conference room where defendants could meet in private with their lawyers . Dan Randolph fished a small oblong plastic box from his inside tunic pocket . About the size of his palm , it was a flat gray color with a single row of tiny winking lights set across its face . All the lights were green . " No bugs in here , " he muttered , adding silently to himself , At least none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detector back into his pocket and turned his gaze again to Mitchell , still glaring at him from across the wobbly conference table . Randolph was on the small side , but solidly built , a welterweight with sandy hair that was turning gray at the temples . He had a pugilist 's face : strong square stubborn jaw , a nose that had been slightly flattened by someone 's fist a long time ago . But his light gray eyes glinted with a secretamusement , as if he were inwardly laughing at the foolishness of men , himself included . Across the table from him Willard Mitchell was scowling grimly . Once he had been lean and athletic , a polo champion at Princeton , a well-known young yachtsman . But years of living in the Moon 's easy gravity had softened him . Now he appeared older than Randolph , bald pate gleaming with perspiration , badly overweight and overwrought . Like Randolph , he was wearing business clothes : a collarless waist-length tunic and matching slacks . But where Dan 's suit of sky blue looked trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrinkled , rumpled ; stains of sweat darkened his armpits . " This all your doing , Randolph , " he snarled in a heavy grating voice . " Do n't think I do n't know that you set me up . " Dan raised his eyes to the glowing ceiling panels . " Lord spare me from my friends , " he said to the air . " I can protect myself from my enemies . " Mitchell 's lawyer , a sallow-skinned old man with the build and demeanor of a cadaver , dressed in a blue so deep it looked almost black , leaned toward his client and whispered something that Dan could not hear . Mitchell scowled at his lawyer , but turned back to Dan and grumbled , " All right , all right , as long as we 're stuck here -- what 's your offer ? " Mitchell was on trial before the Global Economic Council 's lunar tribunal for illegally exceeding his allotted quota of lunar ores . He was guilty . He knew it , his lawyers knew it , and the tribunal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribunal was about to assess would bankrupt him . Dan Randolph leaned both elbows on the rickety table and hunched forward in his chair . " First off , " he said , his voice crisp with suppressed anger , " I did not set you up . " " The hell you say . " " Goddammit to hell and back ! The day I turn anybody over to the GEC will be two weeks after the end of the world . If I wanted to grab your pissant little outfit I would 've done it myself . I do n't need the double-damned GEC to help me . " Mitchell fumed visibly , but held back from answering . Randolph 's lawyer , a strikingly red-haired young woman new to the Moon , was sitting attentively at her boss 's left . She said mildly , " Mr. Mitchell has asked to hear your offer , Dan . " He grinned at her . " Yeah . Right . " " So ? " Mitchell growled . Randolph spread his hands . " I 'll buy your stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent below par because of this lawsuit . " "  - -  and pay the fine that the GEC 's going to sock you with . You continue to operate the company ; you remain CEO and COO . You can buy back your shares at market value whenever you want to . " Mitchell sank back in his chair , the expression on his fleshy face somewhere between suspicion and hope . " Now , wait a minute , " he said . " You buy my shares --  " " All your shares , " said Randolph . " Sixty-three percent of the total outstanding , so I 'm told . " The other man nodded . " You buy the shares . You pay the fine . I stay in charge of the company . And then I can buy the shares back ? " Randolph gave him a crooked grin . " The harder you work , the more the shares 'll be worth . " " Suppose I let the company go to the dogs and leave you holding the bag ? " Randolph shrugged . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shitting on your own baby . " Mitchell glanced at his lawyer , who remained deadpan , then turned back to Randolph . " I do n't get it . What 's in it for you ? " Dan 's smile turned dazzling . " A chance to shaft Malik and his double-damned GEC . What else ? " Continues ...
