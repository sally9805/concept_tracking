<p> TWO young women stroll down a road bordered by fields of alfalfa . As they chat , one shifts a toddler-sized 5-month-old from hip to shoulder . <p> Blond and blue-eyed , they look like sisters , but it is a sisterhood forged by friendship : New mother Andrea Anderson did n't meet Kim Whittaker until the last trimester of her pregnancy with Melissa . Kim had volunteered to be Andrea 's home visitor , guiding her through the last prebirth weeks and the first exhausting , joyful months of motherhood . <p> In no way an at-risk mother , Andrea appears to have it all : a husband , nearby family , a beautiful baby , a lovely home , a dog , a front porch and time to spend on the porch swing rocking her infant . <p> Still , she needed help . <p> " We visited , we got to know each other and she brought me a lot of information and videotapes , " Andrea said of her home visitor . In particular , she said she appreciated the video on breast-feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Breastfeeding is not natural , it 's learned . " <p> Now , as many new mothers find themselves isolated from extended family and sent home from hospitals still hurting and exhausted , visitors like Kim Whittaker offer a bridge over the stresses that come with a new baby . <p> From the plains of northeastern Colorado to inner-city Denver , and from mountain towns to the San Luis Valley , local communities are reaching out to their newest , most vulnerable families , offering a welcome and a hand . <p> Not a new idea , home visitation is common in Europe . In England , it 's universal - even Princess Di got a visit at the births of Princes Harry and Will . Here in Colorado , more than 30 programs operate , some more than 10 years old . <p> What is new is that Gov . Roy Romer and the Colorado Children 's Campaign would like to see all new families offered the option of a volunteer home visit . It is one of several initiatives that will come under the umbrella of a soon-to-be-announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life for Colorado infants and toddlers . <p> Organized by Procter &; Gamble 's retired chairman of the board , Brad Butler , the plan also intends to broaden access to health care for children , from newborns to 3 , to involve the business community in child care and to support the efforts of teen mothers to finish high school . <p> Of those efforts , home visitation will be first out of the chute , says Sue Pfeiffer , coordinator of Warm Welcome , Bright Beginnings ' visitation program . <p> The goal is to approach universality by coordinating grassroots programs that exist and filling in the holes with new programs sensitive to ethnic and geographic differences in communities and differing needs of families . <p> WARM Welcome will begin with 100 Denver mothers who , if they ask for a visit , will get a volunteer bearing flowers , a gift , a card telling what to do to calm a crying baby ( do n't shake it ) , a number for the 24-hour Presbyterian/St . Luke 's parent hotline to get questions answered day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way to get local help . <p> By the end of 1996 , Pfeiffer hopes to have home visitation as an option for every new family in the state , whether it is Warm Welcome or some other visitation variation . Colorado would be the first in the country to offer universal home visitation . Hawaii is trying to move in that direction , but so far only offers visitation to all its high-risk families . <p> Compared to some other programs , Warm Welcome is pretty low-key , but Pfeiffer said : " We believe an awful lot of moms with that extra bit of support will do just peachy . <p> " We have a theory , Brad Butler and I , that this program will demonstrate that 20 percent of the new moms and babies are absolutely under control - they have loving husbands , a lovely home , a grandma and a dog . ' Lovely idea , ' they 'll say . ' May I send in a donation ? ' <p> " Fifty to 75 percent will say , ' How great ! I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The ones who need the Cadillac will be 20 percent . " <p> In Colorado - indeed , in the United States - the Cadillac of home visitation programs is Home Visitation 2000 , directed by Dr. David Olds of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and funded by the Colorado Trust . <p> " But I like to think of us as a Land Rover , " said Olds , " because we 're good at going over very rough terrain . " <p> Public policymakers nationwide are closely watching Olds ' visitation research based in Elmira , N.Y. , Memphis , Tenn. , and Denver that uses nurses as home visitors for families with the highest stress levels : single-parent families , teenaged mothers , families in poverty and families affected by substance abuse or violence . <p> Olds ' results are remarkable . Compared with a control group , women visited by trained nurses : <p> Smoked 26 percent fewer cigarettes and consumed 46 percent less alcohol during their pregnancy . <p> Were 58 percent more likely to use community services and had 24 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their children and fewer beliefs in physical punishment . <p> Reported 62 percent more breast-feeding . <p> Had 26 percent fewer second pregnancies and had household incomes 20 percent greater than the comparison group . <p> " We have analyzed effects of the program on government spending in our original trial in Elmira through the fourth year of the child 's life , " Olds said . " What we have found is the cost of the program is recovered with dividends by the time the children were 4 . <p> " The greatest cost savings came from reduced AFDC ( Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) and food stamp expenditures due to women 's participation in the work force . " But there were also cost savings because of fewer subsequent pregnancies ; reduction in family size produced the largest portion of cost savings , Olds said . <p> THE 2000 visitors ' goals are threefold : to improve the outcomes of the pregnancy ; to help families provide appropriate , responsible care for their children , and to encourage moms to better their own lives by planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We work with families who 've had no previous live births , " Olds said . " The rationale is that we catch mothers at a point in their personal development when they 're making a transition in their lives from being responsible only for themselves to becoming parents . In that transition , we think we can have the greatest effect . " <p> Visitation 2000 provides parents with Snugli infant carriers , toys and books , advice for each developmental stage . Parents are taught how to soothe wailing infants and when to call the doctor . <p> For an example of how 2000 works , consider Jelani DoBynes ' first five weeks of life . A full participant in Jelani 's development before and after birth , Henry DoBynes started reading to his little boy before birth . <p> " Inside and out , " declared Henry , who rocked and bragged about his grinning baby while 19-year-old mother Micah Cook visited with her home visitor , paraprofessional Arlinda Jackson-Brown . <p> Arlinda flipped through the latest photos in Micah 's baby book and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink my milk , " Micah chuckled . <p> " I 'm not here to tell her what to do - we offer information , " Arlinda said . " But we hit it off so readily that I felt I could take a few liberties . " <p> Pregnancy turned out to be more stressful than motherhood , Micah said . There were only two days when Jelani woke up during the night , and now on the few occasions he cries , " I know what one cry means and what another cry means . <p> " He cries if he wants his dad or if he does n't like someone ; ( sometimes ) he pouts and cries like , ' Come and get me . " ' <p> At 5 weeks , Jelani has a library . Personal favorites are a little book of African baby poems and Dr. Seuss . When he hears " Green Eggs and Ham , " he starts making little sounds , his mother says . <p> For Olds , the next research question will be whether paraprofessional visitors like Arlinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nurses . He said there is a tremendous push nationally to use paraprofessionals . <p> But some wish Olds would look at the use of volunteers , since that is the direction Colorado seems to be heading . <p> Boulder children 's advocate Dr. Robert McFarland said , " The Colorado Trust , which is funding Olds ' , represents the status quo - that is their goal . They 've got the best researcher in the country , take a long time and ( the research ) does n't measure the effectiveness of volunteers . He 's comparing nurses with trained para-professionals . <p> " We have to have good data to support home visitation as a national program , and we 're going to have to use volunteers to make it nationwide . We need to figure out how volunteers do versus paid people . " <p> Olds is well aware of the controversy and looks forward to a detente between all home-visitation programs . " We are all in this together for crying out loud , trying to improve the health and well being children and families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliances with advocates from other programs . " <p> THE other home visitation controversy is a widespread suspicion that the visits will be a way for inspectors from social services to step into your home and snatch your babies . <p> It 's come up again and again , and the only way to deal with those rumors is to keep visitation a nongovernmental , volunteer-based service , says pediatrician Richard Krugman , dean of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center . <p> Krugman has been pushing for home visitation as a child-abuse prevention strategy for years . Trained volunteers will do fine , he said , because the bulk of the effort has to be for low-risk families : " A voluntary effort for low-risk families will help us target and focus our resources more appropriately . <p> " Programs for high-risk people will only have public support when the public understands the universal helpfulness of home visiting as a service , and that will only happen when people recognize that even low-risk people have high-risk days . " <p> Warm Welcome 's vision is of a seamless continuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Land Rover , " so that families can be matched with whatever level of help they need , said Barbara O'Brien , director of the Colorado Children 's Campaign . <p> O'Brien stressed the importance of creating community-based services for kids . " We ca n't afford professional services for every kid . We have to get back to neighbors looking after neighbors ' kids . " <p> Though most programs define neighborhoods and communities in geographic terms - visitation for mountain people , plains people , valley people - neighbor may mean kinship by culture or <p> ethnicity . <p> One of the more established programs is based at the Denver Indian Center where visitation is conducted " in the spirit of Indian People helping Indian People . " Using a Parents As Teachers model shaped to fit tribal viewpoints , the DIC visits families twice a month until the child is 6 . " It did n't seem like the families are ready ( to stop ) at 2 , " said DIC director Linda Harjo . <p> Echoing a universal theme , Harjo said the 13,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children under the age of 6 - feel isolated . Single mother Amy Jumping Eagle , an Ogallala Sioux , was far from her family in South Dakota when she asked for visitor Rose Botone , a Kiowa . <p> A business student , Amy said at one point she needed help getting enough food to feed her babies and it was much easier to ask Rose than social services . <p> ONE of O'Brien 's favorite home-visitation programs thrives on the plains of northeastern Colorado . <p> Baby Bear Hugs separates itself from the stigma of social services by being universally available to all families with newborns in Yuma , Washington , Cheyenne , Kit Carson , Lincoln , Morgan and Sedgwick counties , and partially available to new moms in Phillips county . But no one is more enthusiastic about Baby Bear Hugs than Yuma County Social Services director Tom Westfall . <p> " When I first came here in 1976 , I came in on the tail end of a case , " Westfall said . The mom lived in the middle of nowhere and had flung her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child now is blind , has 100 seizures a day , does n't walk and does n't talk , " Westfall said . In medical foster care in El Paso County , " this little gal is going to cost a million dollars before she 's 18 . At 18 , she 'll be moved into a nursing home . <p> In 1979 , Yuma County formed a child protection team to review abuse cases as mandated by state law , and in 1985 they had a child-abuse death - the only one they 've ever had in Yuma County . <p> " We really began to do some soul-searching , " Westfall said . " We decided we as a community had to get involved in prevention so we did n't have to do intervention . Instead of merely reviewing cases of child abuse , we became active in promoting pro-family activities , such as parenting classes for the entire community . <p> " We looked into several different ( home visitation ) models but nothing seemed to fit . We did n't want to extend government , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew people in the community care about kids and we wanted to give them an opportunity to act out their values . " <p> So Baby Bear Hugs was born , a volunteer-based home-visitation program that everybody could use . <p> Just as in urban communities , " support systems have changed in Yuma and families are more mobile , moving from community to community according to the availability of jobs , " said Ruth Seedorf , who directs the 6-year-old regional effort . " Isolation is a definite problem in rural areas and , transportation is a problem , too . <p> " Basically , what we do is recruit volunteers who are parents , train them in communications , peer-support skills , resources in the community and the background of home visitation . Then we recruit families . " <p> Coordinators ask if they want to participate , then try to match volunteers and families in similar circumstances . " If a mother has twins , we match her with a volunteer who has twins ; if she 's had a Caesarean section , we match her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most programs have a target population , in northeastern Colorado they wanted to make visitation available to everyone . " One of the things with a rural area is , you know everybody - in fact , you know everybody 's car - so the point was to make it a natural , normal thing to do , " Seedorf said . <p> Each county has its own visitation advisory committee , which have been inspired to look beyond visitation to other children 's issues in their communities . " This is the most exciting thing , " said Seedorf . <p> In Lincoln County , they developed Baby Bear Hugs nights where monthly speakers come and talk to parents on various topics - getting along with teenagers , for example . <p> FAR from the plains of northeastern Colorado , the mountain community of Conifer has a different visitation program , based at the Mountain Family Center with family counseling , well-baby checkups , immunization , childbirth classes , volunteer attorneys , a domestic-violence coordinator and other services . <p> Again , isolation is a problem in mountain communities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little commerce between neighbors . <p> On a drive to visit an unmarried mother of 1-month-old twin girls , Prins said her program offers information , connection to local resources , developmental screening and other services , but " we will also watch your child while you take a nap or shower if you have n't been able to do that . " <p> At the end of her drive up the side of a mountain , Prins found tired but proud mom Denine Perry , 29 , who is staying at her parents ' house with Kayla and Kiona . Denine is n't just tired , she said , " I 'm delirious . " But she pointed out the girls ' progress to Prins and held them together to see if they could be told apart . <p> The hardest part , she said , " is not having the father here to help . " Though he 's around , " it 's not to help with the 2 o'clock feedings - do you know what I mean ? " <p> Denine and Sandy fed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on little hats and carried them up to the deck to have their pictures taken . At the end , Sandy asked if she should leave with the other visitors or stay for a while . <p> Denine gave her a rueful smile : " I could use a hand .
