<p> THE FIRST TIME DEBORAH VOIGT sang through Sieglinde 's music from " Die Walkure " two years ago , her voice coach started crying . Clearly , Ms. Voigt 's connection to this touchstone Wagner role was immediate , intuitive and affecting . <p> Ms. Voigt performed her first Sieglinde last spring at the Metropolitan Opera to great acclaim . She is singing the role again in the Met 's current presentations of Wagner 's " Ring " cycle , and the reaction of critics and audiences has been even more enthusiastic . <p> Ms. Voigt , a 36-year-old American soprano , says she has come to understand why she so identifies with this humane and immensely sad character . During the last year , Ms. Voigt has undergone a regimen of exercise and dieting , which she believes has changed her as a person and an artist . In the process , she has combated the notion , subscribed to by many singers , that large voices and large bodies go together . And through it all , Sieglinde , who undergoes her own profound transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , Sieglinde was taken by robbers , who murdered her mother and burned down their woodland home . She was kept , abused and , as a young woman , forced into marriage with a brutish clansman . Though she was , in fact , a daughter of the god Wotan , she did not realize it and was made to feel like a rootless nobody . <p> " She is bullied and laughed at , " Ms. Voigt said recently . " She is trapped in a situation where she ca n't express any of the specialness she feels inside herself . " <p> Ms. Voigt , who will sing her next Sieglinde on Monday evening , knows the feeling . Growing up in Chicago , she sang in the choir of her conservative Baptist church and was , on the surface , happy . " I was one of those little girls who put on the record of ' My Fair Lady ' and danced around the living room , " she said . Soon she was taking classical voice lessons . While she sang in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a typical 60 's household . <p> But like many adolescents , particularly females , she had problems of self-esteem and distorted ideas about her body . As she went off to college at California State University , Fullerton , she started putting on weight . Lots of weight . Still , she had early success as an operatic soprano . Her sound was radiant , enormous and unforced . With her supple sense of phrasing and keen musical intelligence , she was soon hailed as a soprano born to sing the most taxing roles of Verdi , Strauss and Wagner . <p> " One would have thought this wonderful success would have been a catalyst to do something about myself physically , " Ms. Voigt said . " But I fought it for so long . It 's easy to get wrapped up thinking , ' I 'm a great singer , and that 's what 's most important . ' Unfortunately , this is not the society we live in . " <p> She tried crash-dieting , liquid fasts , a gastric bubble , all " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For whatever reason , I was n't really ready . " <p> By January 1996 , she was . With support from her husband , friends , an understanding doctor and a good therapist , she began a sensible program of exercise and dieting . In one year , she lost 80 pounds . She feels great , she said , and relaxing at a friend 's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , she exuded vigor and optimism . <p> " I still have a long way to go , " she added . " But I feel vastly improved . I communicate better . I 'm much freer on stage . It 's great to not worry about flinging myself on the floor . " <p> So why does the idea persist that only hefty singers can develop voices with great thrust and stamina ? <p> " This is a myth , " Placido Domingo said recently , during a break in rehearsals at the Met , where he has been singing Siegmund to Ms. Voigt 's Sieglinde . " You have to have strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't help with that . And it is not healthy in general to carry such extra weight . It 's wonderful to see what Deborah has done with herself . It will help tremendously , especially today , when there is so much opera on television . " <p> Ms. Voigt agrees . " Many of our great dramatic voices of the past have not been small people , " she said . " But there is a difference between someone who is big-boned or big-statured , and someone whose eating habits are out of control . " <p> There have been singers in recent years who lost large amounts of weight in ways undetrimental to their voices : the American soprano Carol Vaness , for one . But the myth Mr. Domingo mentions has been fueled by some notable failures . Maria Callas was enormous at the start of her career , then she shed pounds precipitously until she looked like someone born to the figure of a fashion model . But those who heard her during the transition , like Joan Sutherland , attest to the toll the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much weight in midcareer and , with it , some of the beauty and flexibility of her singing . <p> BUT YOU HAVE TO EXAMINE the vocal circumstances of singers who lose weight quickly , Ms. Voigt insisted . <p> " Were they singing repertory appropriate to the size of their voice , not the size of their waist ? " she said . " Was their technique what it should be regardless of their size ? There is a natural support mechanism built in by carrying extra weight around your middle . If you do n't know how to control those muscles when the weight is gone , then that becomes a problem . But it 's not a question of damaging the vocal cords . " <p> Ms. Voigt suggests that her voice is freer and feels better because her body is freer and feels better . And Mr. Domingo , who first worked with Ms. Voigt in 1994 at the Arena di Verona in Italy , conducting her in Verdi 's " Aida , " professes to be more impressed than ever with her singing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The voice is unbelievable . When she sings a phrase as Sieglinde , it becomes part of me . It makes me melt and makes me try harder to make my phrases beautiful also . " <p> Mr. Voigt has exercised caution in taking on roles , and her new fitness regimen will not change that . There will be no Turandots or Brunnhildes in her immediate future , despite constant offers . Among her favorite roles is Amelia in Verdi 's " Ballo in Maschera , " which she recently sang at the Met with Luciano Pavarotti . ( " Am I the lucky girl with the tenors this year , or what ? " she asked . ) Her recording as Senta in Wagner 's " Flying Dutchman , " with James Morris in the title role and James Levine conducting , has just been released by Sony . <p> Next season , she will sing in the new Robert Wilson production of " Lohengrin " at the Met . But she is especially looking forward to revisiting , in her slimmed-down state , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which has been her signature part . Mentioning that her husband , John Leitch , now works for her career , she called the whole operation " Ariadne Inc . " <p> " Ariadne is a magnificent role , " she said . " But I especially love it because it gives me a chance to be silly . " In Strauss 's opera-within-an-opera , an imperious prima donna must endure the addition of comic minstrels to her enactment of the Ariadne tragedy . It 's a role that allows a willing soprano to laugh at herself , and Ms. Voigt 's vocally lustrous portrayal is enlivened by surprisingly good comic timing and a gift for deadpan reactions . <p> She would like to do more comedy . Rosalinde in Johann Strauss 's " Fledermaus " would be a " hoot and a half , " she said . But it is unlikely to happen , given the demand in the opera world for dramatic sopranos . <p> Although she is loath to record a role before acquiring experience performing it on stage , she is making a major exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record " Tristan und Isolde " for Decca/London , long ago settled on the tenor Ben Heppner as his Tristan but debated for 18 months between two sopranos before offering Isolde to Ms. Voigt , who had never sung it . Mr. Solti , one of the great Wagner interpreters of the era , is 84 . <p> " What I can learn from Maestro Solti about this music is too important to pass up , " Ms. Voigt explained . " That 's one gold ring I am going to grab , whatever criticism comes my way . " <p> Curious listeners can catch an early hint of her interpretation in July , when Ms. Voigt sings Isolde 's " Liebestod " with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic during the Lincoln Center Festival . <p> For now , Ms. Voigt is immersed in Sieglinde , and she finds parallels in the character 's emergence from the trap of her life . Ms. Voigt points to one crucial moment where Sieglinde 's poignant transformation begins . As Siegmund , the wounded stranger who turns out to be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mead . He accepts but invites her to take the first drink from the cup . <p> " Such a kindness has never happened to Sieglinde before , " Ms. Voigt said . " Oh , maybe some slobby guy , one of her husband 's leering friends , has said , ' Hey , Honey , have a sip . ' But nothing like this gracious act of kindness and respect . " <p> As performed by Ms. Voigt and Mr. Domingo , that moment is indeed touching and deeply felt . Mr. Domingo understands what it means to be gracious . And Ms. Voigt has learned all about transformations .
