LEVINE 'S HEART sank when he heard the honking siren-just like the Gestapo in that old Anne Frank movie-and then saw the red lights twirling atop the police car behind him . " Please turn right at the light , " instructed a voice over the speaker . Levine moved his green Jaguar off Sheridan onto Granville . Dammit , there goes another twenty minutes . He was late as it was . A heavyset black cop approached . " May I see your license and insurance card , sir ? " Removing them from his wallet , Levine passed the documents through the open window . <p> " I wonder if you 're aware that you were speeding , Barry , " the cop said , " doing 43 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone . " <p> Levine considered responding , " What 's this Barry bullshit , officer , do we know each other ? Just give me the ticket and let 's both get going . " In the good-old , bad-old Chicago days , he would have kept a ten-dollar bill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's license , the cop would have slipped it out , returned the wallet , and everyone would have gone away happy . No longer . Levine decided to go with the honesty ploy . " I would n't be surprised , officer . I 'm already late to pick up my kids for my weekend visit , and I guess I was pushing it . I 'm awfully sorry . " <p> It worked . " I 'm a divorced father myself , " the cop offered in return . " I know how it is . " <p> " Yeah , " Levine said , " it 's not so great . " <p> " I 'm going to let you off on this one , Barry . " The cop handed back Levine 's documents . " But watch it . The next officer stops you may just be a happily married man . " <p> " Not too many of those , " said Levine with a smile , " but thanks a lot . I appreciate it . " Nice cop , decent guy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luck . He had been living in dread since he first heard from Sandy on Monday <p> " Barry ? " she had said over the phone , and at the sound of her voice , Levine froze . " Barry ? It 's Sandy . " Her casualness blotted out the fact that she and Levine had n't spoken for more than four-Jesus ! it would soon be five years . <p> " Sandy , good to hear from you , " Levine lied . " What 's doing ? " <p> It turned out she was coming from Los Angeles to Chicago for her 20th high-school reunion , and she was bringing the kids . They were going to stay for three days , and she had all the bases covered except for Saturday afternoon , when a class picnic was planned and she had no one to watch Jonathan and Jennifer . Could he take them off her hands for five , maybe six hours ? <p> Had he been faster on his feet , Levine would have claimed an out-of-town appointment , a golf date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost it . He heard himself saying , in a dopey , unbelievably saccharine voice : " Sure , Saturday afternoon will be great . Where can I pick them up ? " <p> What a schmuck ! <p> MRs. Sandra Kantor Levine Kravitz , Levine 's first and former and only wife , had been remarried for nearly eight years now , and thank God Kravitz had come along when he did . Ten years older than Levine , never married , a lawyer who worked in trusts and estates with a big Jewish firm in L.A. , Harvey Kravitz had gotten him off the hook in more ways than one . Because of him , Levine did not have to think about his ex-wife with pity , anger , or guilt ; he did n't have to think of her at all , and in fact he almost never did . <p> Soon after marrying her , Kravitz also told Sandy they need n't bother with child-support payments . <p> Although Levine put up a feigned protest , this was dandy with him . Two grand less a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G 's for the maintenance of children he no longer saw and to help out a wife he 'd really just as soon did n't exist . He could find better uses for the money . <p> Jonathan had been three and Jennifer a year and a half when Levine and Sandy divorced . In their generally acrimonious separation , visitation was one of the biggest bones of contention . Marty Spivak , Levine 's attorney , had fought for Levine to get the children every weekend and-once they were in school-during spring and Christmas vacations and for a full month each summer . It sounded good at the time . But what was a bachelor , then in his early forties , supposed to do with two infant children for a full weekend ? <p> Levine 's parents were still alive , and at first he used to bring the kids over to their place . They were very good about it , doting and generous in the way of Jewish grandparents . But for him , hanging around his parents ' apartment in Winston Towers with its lime-colored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushing his daughter in a stroller around the streets of West Rogers Park , carrying his son piggyback , he often went to a nearby playground to put Jonathan on the swing or play with both children in the sandbox . Each weekend came to seem like a fiscal quarter-a bad fiscal quarter . <p> Levine began to skip occasionally . Then his mother got liver cancer , and , with her chemo treatments , became too weak to help look after the kids . <p> By the time Harvey Kravitz came along , Levine was ready-relieved-to let him move Sandy and the kids to Los Angeles . Two years later , after a couple of notably unsuccessful visits-he stayed at a Ramada Inn in Westwood , mostly watching pay-per-view movies in his room-Sandy announced that Kravitz wanted to adopt Jonathan and Jennifer , and he was ready to concede that , too . <p> " Barry , " his father told him , " do n't be crazy . They 're your children , your flesh and blood , they should carry your name . " But Levine felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , and his Los Angeles visits were a complete bust , demoralizing in every way . What the hell , he thought , Kravitz pays all the bills , and they seem to like him well enough . Let them be Kravitz 's kids , let them take his name . In the end , what , really , does it matter ? After a year or so , he ceased calling every few weeks ; then he stopped sending birthday gifts . Final <p> ly , he no longer even thought of himself as a father . <p> WHEN THEY were married , there was nothing that Sandy and Levine could n't find to fight about : her parents , his parents , his friends , her friends , money , child-raising methods , food , and of course sex . Levine was thirty-five when he married-no kid-Sandy twenty-four . He had felt maybe it was time for him to come in with his hands up . A grievous error . The problem probably was n't even Sandy ; it was marriage . He , Levine came to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural bachelors . <p> After the divorce he moved into an apartment on Scott Street , on the old gold coast . He left the commodities market each afternoon at 2:00 , and by 2:30 he was on the treadmill at the McClure Court Club , or shooting baskets in a pickup game , or sitting in a Jacuzzi , checking out passing women , of whom , for a man with money and leisure , there seemed to be no shortage . Most evenings , when not with a younger woman , he would have dinner with a few guys from the club . They would talk sports , or stocks , or funny adventures with broads . <p> He liked things the way they were . One Friday afternoon at McClure a guy named Lou Berlin asked if he was free for the weekend . Berlin had just invited two girls on a high-rollers ' junket to Vegas ; he needed to make a foursome , but they had to be on a plane at O'Hare in two hours . Levine looked at the woman he was to escort-Debbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last-a racquetball player at the club , small , nice body , thick dark hair , and said , why not , let 's go . He boarded the plane with nothing but the clothes he was wearing and his American Express card and bought everything , even underwear , at Caesar 's Palace . Debbie turned out to be a very accommodating young lady , Levine won more than three grand at craps and blackjack , and as a souvenir of the weekend he still had two pair of cashmere socks for which he had paid 50 bucks a shot . <p> When Levine went out with a new girl-and most of the women he went out with he thought of as girls-he would tell her that he was divorced but never mention having had children . If they asked , he lied and said no . He was n't likely to be with the girl that long , so the lie was unlikely to catch up with him . And thus far it had n't . <p> IT WAS 11:10 when Levine 's Jaguar pulled up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sandy and the two children were waiting at the entrance . He felt an urge to accelerate and keep driving . From the car , he could see that the girl , now ten-and-a-half , had her mother 's fair skin and light hair-dishwater blond , it used to be called ; he noted , too , the braces on her teeth . Jonathan looked more like a Levine , dark , small , with curly hair ; he looked , in fact , astonishingly like Levine at the same age . Sandy , who had put on a few pounds , seemed exactly what she was , a rich attorney 's wife and a mother who had fought , successfully , to keep her family together . A brief and thoroughly unexpected flare of admiration shot through him . <p> Pulling the car over , Levine left the engine running and walked up to them . He had neglected to prepare an opening line . " Sorry to be late . " <p> " Hello , Barry , " his ex-wife said , all business . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here at the hotel by 5:00 . " " Should n't be a problem . " <p> " Great , " she said , " and thanks for helping out . " Was there a touch of sarcasm in her voice , or was Levine imagining it ? His radar was n't working so well this morning . Probably he was imagining . At any rate he hoped he was . <p> " Maybe we 'll have a chance to talk later , " Sandy said , turning back into the cool dark of the lobby . Levine and the children had not yet spoken . Both kids got into the back seat . As Levine pulled out , he caught a glimpse of them in the rearview mirror sitting close together , almost huddled . It occurred to him they might feel even more awkward than he . <p> " What do you say to lunch and a trip to the zoo in Lincoln Park ? " He had nearly six hours to kill . Although it was early June , the Cubs were out of town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ball game , though for all he knew his daughter might be one of those girl athletes . He did n't really know about the boy . Maybe he was a video-game nut . Who knew ? <p> " Whatever you want , " replied Jonathan . " OK , " Levine said , sensing a long afternoon , " the zoo it is . " <p> He took McCormick over to Devon , thinking the kids might be interested in the neighborhood where he and their mother had both grown up . Of course , it had all changed drastically since those days . West of California , it was now dominated by kosher butchers , Jewish bookstores , Hebrew day schools . <p> Men in hasidic garb walked the streets ; on weekdays , young wives wearing wigs and with three or four children in tow popped in and out of stores . East of California , Devon became heavily East Indian , with lots of sari shops , vegetarian groceries , jewelry emporia , stores with appliances wired for India . " West Rajah 's Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Your mother and I grew up here , " Levine said . " Has she ever told you anything about it ? " " She said that people did n't think too much about crime , " the girl piped up . " Not like now . " To Levine , studying her in the mirror , her braces made her seem all the more vulnerable . <p> " That 's true , " he said . " When I was younger than you , Jonathan , my parents let me go downtown on the El by myself . My father-you probably do n't remember him- grew up with two guys who owned a gym where boxers trained . They let me hang out there . You care about sports ? " <p> " Pro basketball , " the boy said . <p> " Me , too , " Levine agreed . " Follow the Bulls ? " <p> " Who does n't ? Michael Jordan , Scottie Pippen , crazy Dennis Rodman . " <p> " I like Rodman 's hair , " the girl said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to ruin it " <p> " He can rebound like crazy , " Jonathan put in . <p> " But he ca n't stand up to Shaq in the low post . In the low post Shaq would take him on tour . " <p> " You 're both right , " Levine said . So he had a son who knew sports . His own boyhood was dominated by them : playing , watching , fantasizing . Something nice about this discovery <p> On the Outer Drive he passed Weiss Memorial Hospital , where both his parents had died . Best to leave this unmentioned . Through his divorce , he had deprived his own parents of the pleasures of their grandchildren . Neither had ever said anything to him about it . He doubted that he himself would ever be a grandfather , except in the most remote and technical sense . Right now that did n't seem to him much of a deprivation . Different generations , different views . <p> At a Greek restaurant on Halsted named Demi 's he ordered an omelette made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cokes . " You like growing up in California , Jennifer ? " <p> " Nobody calls her Jennifer , " Jonathan said . <p> " Everybody calls her Jenny . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> " It 's fun , " the girl said , " though maybe I 'd like to see snow sometimes . " <p> " California 's all we know , " Jonathan added . " We 've got nothing to compare it to . " <p> " When you were little , of course , " Levine reminded them , " you lived in Chicago . " <p> " You mean when you were our father , " Jenny said . <p> " Right . " Past tense noted . <p> Halfway through lunch Jenny knocked over her Coke , half of which spilled onto her brother 's fries and uneaten cheeseburger . Rising to wipe up the mess , Levine noticed a redhead , maybe in her late twenties , entering the restaurant ; impressive jugs but , in his judgment , a little short in the leg . Not , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have seemed like a divorced father out with his kids for the weekend , or maybe a guy giving his wife a break on a Saturday , but certainly not what he was-a permanent bachelor , perpetually on the attack . <p> APPARENTLY A visit to the zoo on a sunny early summer day was not an altogether original idea . <p> Three times Levine drove around the streets before finally pulling into a garage on Clark where a sullen Mexican took a twelve-buck fee without any thanks . At the entrance to the park , Jenny wanted a great blue bouffant of cotton candy being sold by a Pakistani . <p> " She 's not supposed to eat candy because of her braces , " her brother said , a note of satisfaction in his voice . <p> " Yes I can , " the girl protested , " if I rinse after . " <p> " Where are you going to rinse here , dork ? " <p> " None of your business , moron . " <p> " OK , " Levine stepped in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream and peanuts inside . How 's that ? " <p> " But I love cotton candy , " Jenny said , " and I can rinse out at one of the fountains . " <p> Screw it , Levine thought , I see these kids for one day ; am I supposed to be responsible for her character as well as her dental hygiene ? He shelled out two bucks and handed Jenny the blue cone . <p> The zoo was teeming . Lots of kids being wheeled around in strollers . Many grandparents , plus some guys with younger wives and little kids-secondfamily men . A band was playing : blacks in dreadlocks clanged away on steel drums while a woman an with a shaved head sang a combination of African and Caribbean melodies . Levine took Jenny 's hand . Jonathan walked a few steps ahead . They joined the crowd around the seals , who were darting in and out of their pool and hooting as they slapped themselves dry on the rocks . <p> Levine looked around for Jonathan , but he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed you to view the animals from beneath . Probably , the boy had gone down for a look . <p> " Jenny , " Levine said , letting go of her hand , " wait right here . Do n't move . I have to find your brother . " Quickly he walked downstairs , the blue from the water giving off a slightly eerie light in the darkish corridor . Three black kids in NBA jerseys with baggy shorts , big shoes , and baseball hats worn backward stared into one of the windows . At the end of the walkway Levine found Jonathan peering through another . He thought briefly of scolding him but instead took his hand and walked him back outside . When they got there , Jenny was gone . " Shit , " Levine said aloud . " Now what ? " <p> " She sometimes just goes off by herself , " the boy replied , " like in a department store or something . She can get kinda dreamy . My mom and dad always find her . " The " dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was shining with particular radiance . People seemed happy to be out with their children , gazing at animals , drinking soda , eating lemon ices , listening to music . Calm seemed everywhere but in Levine 's heart . He was n't even sure in which direction to begin . There had to be a central lost-andfound somewhere , but would Jenny know where to find it and have the good sense to wait for him there ? <p> He steered Jonathan into the nearby big-cat house . Most of the lions , leopards , and tigers were out-of-doors , lazing , along with a solitary cheetah , in the sun . Searching the nearly empty building , he noted only a single panther padding slowly around its cage . The muscles in the beast 's chest , the cold look in its eyes , sent a shiver through Levine . These days the press was full of child-molestation stories . Block it out . <p> They tried the snake house . No Jenny . Then the ape house , a new building The large gorillas were napping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered . Where the hell was she ? C'm on , sweetheart , Levine pleaded silently , do n't put me through this . Outside , back in the beaming sun , Levine took Jonathan 's hand . They passed the giraffes with their gentle quizzical looks , the zebras swishing their tails , shaggy bisons and wildebeests seriously in need of a bath . Finally , they came upon a building marked Information Center . <p> " Excuse me , " Levine said to the young woman inside with a diamond chip on the side of her nose . " Is there a lost-and-found for kids ? I want to report a little girl missing . " <p> " It 's at Gateway House , " she said , " at the East Gate . Would you like me to call to see if she 's there ? We could also have her paged . " <p> " Please , " Levine said . " Her name 's Jenny Kravitz . She 's ten , and she 's wearing a red T-shirt and jeans . Braces on her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Levine thought . He had a pretty good imagination for disaster , and at the moment it was envisioning Mexican street gangs , old perverts , canny kidnappers , ransom notes ; the possibilities were practically endless . <p> I 'M SORRY , your daughter 's not at Gateway . House , " the girl reported , hanging up the phone . " But she could show up at any moment , Mr. Kravitz , and in the meantime I 'll do a page . " <p> " Thanks , " he said . " But it 's Levine , not Kravitz . " <p> " I thought you said her name was Kravitz . " <p> " It is , but mine 's Levine . It 's a long story . " <p> " I see , " she said , not looking as if she did . As they left the building , they heard Jenny 's name over the public-address system . <p> " I 'm thirsty , " Jonathan said . " Could I get a Coke or something ? " <p> The closest spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Levine thought he ought to accommodate the boy . They sat for a moment at one of the tables along the lagoon . <p> " What will you do , " Jonathan asked , " if my sister 's dead ? " <p> " Jesus , " said Levine , " she 's not dead . Do n't even talk that way . " <p> " No , I mean what would you do if she was ? " <p> " I 'd feel terrible , " Levine said . " Would n't you ? " <p> " Yeah , sure , but I mean I 'm her brother . I 'm supposed to . " <p> " Well , I 'm her father . " <p> " Not really . " <p> " What do you mean not really ? " <p> " I mean you 're only sort of our father , but not really . Is n't that right ? I mean you do n't see us , you do n't talk to us . Do you think about us ? " <p> " Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " <p> " Then how come you never call or anything ? " <p> " I guess I think maybe it makes it easier on everybody if I do n't . I mean , you live far away and everything . " <p> " I once asked my new dad what he would do if he did n't live with his children , and you know what he said ? " <p> " No , " said Levine . <p> " He said it would kill him if he lost his children . But then he said that everyone is different and we should n't judge you . Maybe you have your reasons . " The boy paused . <p> " I do have reasons , " Levine said , sweating . " The main one is that I did n't want to make your lives more complicated . Your mother and I did n't get along so well when we were married , and I thought maybe it would be easier if I just sort of disappeared . " <p> " I see , " Jonathan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . <p> " Look , " Levine said , " we better get to Gateway House . Maybe your sister is there waiting for us . " <p> " Maybe , " the boy said , noisily draining the last of his drink . <p> Levine thought they should check the petting zoo , which was in a nearby barn . As he and the boy walked through the door , he saw Jenny standing near a small black goat . A flash of anger was quickly swallowed by relief . He watched as the child made a tentative approach to the little goat . Hard to believe she would be a woman one day , exciting to men , with her own plots and agendas . As they walked up to her she turned and smiled as if nothing in the world were wrong . God , Levine thought , those braces ! He put his hand on her head , about to pet her just as she was petting the goat . Then he remembered his anger . <p> " Where have you been ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had your brother and me worried sick . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I just got tired of waiting for you at the seals . " <p> " Mom would kill you if she knew what you did , " her brother lectured her . <p> " It 's none of your business . " <p> " It 's my business , " Levine interjected . " I 'm responsible for you , at least for this afternoon . And Jonathan 's right . Your mother would be furious with both of us if she knew you just took off on your own the way you did . " <p> " You know she would , too , Jenny , " Jonathan added . <p> " Look , let 's get out of here , " Levine said . " Let 's get out of the zoo and get an ice cream or something . " <p> They made their way out , Jenny 's hand tightly folded in Levine 's , Jonathan walking alongside . The Lincoln Park neighborhood seemed very youthful on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spandex , their hair pulled back in ponytails , out for a jog . <p> They found a Baskin-Robbins on Clark , near Fullerton , where Levine stood in line behind a homosexual couple roughly his own age , two bald guys in tank tops . He bought double-dip sugar cones for the kids-rocky road and cherry vanilla for Jenny , two scoops of pistachio for Jonathan-and a nonfat frozen chocolate yogurt for himself . A booth opened up , and they grabbed it . <p> " Are you gon na tell Mommy about my getting lost ? " Jenny asked . <p> " Would you prefer I did n't ? " <p> " Yeah , " she said , " I think she 'd only get mad-I mean , really mad . " <p> " What do you think , Jonathan ? " Levine asked . " Can we keep it a secret , just between the three of us ? " <p> " OK , " he said , " I wo n't tell . " <p> " Bet he does , " Jenny said . <p> " Bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't tell , he wo n't tell , " Levine said . " He looks to me like a man who keeps his word , and I believe him . " He put out his hand ; Jenny took it . Levine then reached for Jonathan 's hand and put it on top . " So it 's our secret then , " he said . <p> DRIVING HOME , brother and sister once more sat in the back seat . Passing Weiss Memorial again , Levine , feeling like a chauffeur in his own car , said : " See that red-brick building on the left ? That 's where my mother and father died . They were your grandparents , you know . " <p> " Were they nice ? " Jenny asked . <p> " Very nice , fair and kind and good-hearted , and they loved you both when you were babies , though of course you ca n't be expected to remember them . " <p> " What did they die from ? " Jonathan asked . <p> " Cancer . Both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Mommy get divorced ? " Jenny asked . " Mommy said you stopped loving each other . Is that true ? " <p> " Sort of , " Levine said . " But maybe it 's just as true to say that I did n't like being married all that much . " <p> " Does that mean you did n't like being our father ? " the girl asked . <p> A tough question . " I would n't put it that way , " he said , looking at the kids in the mirror . He was glad to be sitting where he was , where they could n't see directly into his face . " I would say that I was n't all that good at being a father . " <p> " Is that a good reason for leaving us ? " Jonathan put in . <p> " No , I suppose not . But your new father 's good to you , right ? He loves you , right ? So maybe it worked out for the best . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had Levine himself at twelve been as relentless as this kid ? <p> " It 's not the same thing as what ? " <p> " It 's not the same thing as having your real father , " Jonathan said . <p> Levine , turning off the Outer Drive and onto Sheridan Road , did n't answer . <p> " Do you love us ? " Jenny asked . <p> " What a question . Of course I do . " He was passing the place where , earlier today , the cop had stopped him for speeding . No response from the back seat After another block or two , the silence seemed chilling . At the corner of Sheridan and Devon , Levine thought to tell them about the great Granada movie theater that once stood here , an Aladdinish place , huge and wildly ornate , where he went every Friday night through high school . Going to the Granada as a boy to watch Cary Grant and Gary Cooper and Tyrone Power , he certainly never thought he might one day become a father who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Not that they had been left to poverty , hunger , or anything like that . They were probably living better with Kravitz than they would if he had stayed married to their mother . Maybe if they had n't moved to goddamn California he would have managed to keep in touch . But they were two thousand miles away , for shit 's sake . What was he supposed to do ? Sneaking another peek in the mirror , Levine realized he could n't quite successfully suppress what he knew was the correct answer to that question . <p> It was 5:05 when the Jaguar pulled up to the door of the Hilton . Sandy , waiting inside , came out and opened the back door . <p> " Did you have a nice time ? " <p> " Yes , " Jenny said . Jonathan said nothing . <p> " The zoo was crowded , " Levine offered . " We had an ice cream about an hour or so ago . Hope it wo n't spoil their dinner . " <p> A bit nervous , Levine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Want to come in for a cup of coffee ? " Sandy asked . <p> " Thanks , but I 'd better be off . Besides , you probably want to get going . " <p> " I suppose we should . " <p> " It was fun , " Levine said . " They 're good kids . " He put out his hand to Jonathan , who shook it without looking at him . Turning to Jenny , he found himself pulling the child to him and kissing the top of her head . " Bye , baby , " he muttered . <p> " Good-bye , " she said . It occurred to him that neither of them had called him anything all day long . In a slightly jerky movement , Sandy quickly leaned in , brushing his cheek with hers . " Thanks . " <p> Somehow Levine managed to get back behind the wheel , lower the window on the passenger side , and try his best to smile and wave as he pulled away . In the rearview mirror he saw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , the two of them waving back ; her son made no movement at all . For once , Levine was glad he had nothing on for the evening . Maybe he 'd grab a sandwich , watch a ball game on television , hit the sack early . It had been a long day . <p> Sidebar
