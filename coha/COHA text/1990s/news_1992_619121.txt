<p> I HAVE always found Leonora Carrington to be one of the least convincing of Surrealist painters . " Leonora Carrington : The Mexican Years , " at the Mexican Museum ( through March 1 ) , does nothing to change that , but this project is praiseworthy all the same . <p> The Carrington show , comprising 30-odd works , is a modest complement to other recent West Coast exhibitions devoted to Surrealism or to modern ( and premodern ) art in Mexico . These included the Mexican Museum 's own presentation of Frida Kahlo 's art , 1990 's " Anxious Visions : Surrealist Art " ( which included a Carrington ) at the University Art Museum , Berkeley ; " Mexico : Splendors of 30 Centuries , " which just closed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ; and the concurrent survey of 20th century Mexican painting at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Los Angeles . <p> In a variety of ways , these exhibitions have evoked Mexico as a place where ancient and modern cultures feed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ( at least not at a conscious level ) in urban North America . Andre Breton , founder of the Surrealist movement , famously referred to Mexico as " the Surrealist place par excellence . " <p> The Surrealist project , as Breton defined it , was to resuscitate " the marvelous " in a disenchanted age obsessed with science , material progress and social control . Like Dada , Surrealism arose in reaction to World War I , which a whole generation saw as appalling proof of European bourgeois society 's hypocrisy and soul-sickness . <p> Confronting a culture they saw as stupidly confident of its own rationality , the Surrealists determined to invert or erase distinctions on which " normal " life rested : dream and waking , order and disorder , desire and calculation , subjective and objective , truth and falsehood . " What would be sought for its own sake would no longer be truth , " according to Jacqueline Cheniuex-Gendron , " but living , living otherwise than in everyday mediocrity , living outside the track to which society assigns each of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Carrington in 1936 when she met Max Ernst ( 1891- 1976 ) , who had long been transmuting them into art . ( Ernst would break with the Surrealist movement a year later  --  the same year Carrington joined it  --  but with no consequence to the style of his work . ) <p> Carrington was born in 1917 in Lancashire , England , the only daughter among the four children of a wealthy textile manufacturer . Her life before " the Mexican years " was the stuff of Surrealist legend . <p> She was rebellious from an early age and was expelled from two Catholic schools for girls before being sent to Florence for a year of art studies . There she encountered 14th and 15th century Italian paintings whose influence echoes distantly throughout her work . <p> Reluctantly , she cooperated with her parents ' social ambitions for her , attending finishing school in Paris to prepare for her debut before the social elite at the court of George V. <p> Once this obligation to convention was fulfilled , she informed her parents of her intent to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art academy in London set up by Amedee Ozenfant ( 1886-1966 ) , co-founder ( with Le Corbusier ) of the post-Cubist style known as Purism . <p> Soon after that , she saw the International Surrealist Exhibition in London , met Ernst and decided to follow him on his return to Paris , in defiance of her parents ' wishes , at which point her father disowned her . <p> She lived in Paris and then in rural France with Ernst until , with the outbreak of war in 1939 , he was detained by the French government because of his German citizenship . <p> He was released later that year ( though not as a result of her anxious efforts on his behalf ) and rearrested in 1940 . The Surrealist group dispersed and Carrington found herself , at 23 , alone and desperate . <p> She fled to Spain , where she ended up in an asylum to undergo treatment for a nervous breakdown . ( She later wrote an account of her madness , " Down Below , " that is regarded as a Surrealist classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to transfer her to an institution in South Africa . En route , in Lisbon , she gave her warder the slip and sought the help of a Mexican diplomat , Renato Leduc , to whom Picasso had once introduced her in Paris . <p> She married Leduc to secure legal immigration to Mexico . They lived in New York during 1942 , where she renewed friendships with several of the exiled Parisian Surrealists , and finally settled in Mexico , where she would remain for more than 40 years in what she describes as isolation . Between 1985 and 1990 , she lived in New York and Chicago , and more recently has moved back to Mexico City . <p> Carrington claims to have been subject to visions since childhood . In the exhibition catalog essay , Whitney Chadwick writes that Carrington 's " images often arise in the state of lucid dreaming that cabalistic doctrine identifies with astral projection , " but neither she nor Carrington says anything about the technique of lucid dreaming , which entails becoming conscious of the dream process as it is happening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly realizes that he is dreaming , is at the threshold of this exercise . <p> However , no such special practices seem necessary to account for either the continuity of style or the obscurity of content in Carrington 's art , which to me look like products of careful , characteristic stylization . Perhaps her dreams are more theatrical than mine , but my episodes of lucid dreaming are marked by a feeling of feet-on-the-ground immersion in events just the opposite of the staged , frontal quality of her quirky vignettes . <p> Chadwick credits Carrington with evoking in her pictures the state of nondivision  --  which every mystical tradition speaks of  --  that accommodates conscious and unconscious , material and immaterial , mundane and transcendent entities without contradiction . <p> Similar claims have been made on behalf of contemporary painter Francesco Clemente , whose work is prolific , wildly arbitrary and supremely self-confident . Occasionally , Clemente turns out something whose imagery really does appear to have dictated itself and manifested unseen possibilities . The only works by Carrington now on view that are similarly convincing are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ) . <p> To anyone who knows painting , the conventions and craft habits in Carrington 's visual work obtrude themselves too much to permit any sense of initiation into visionary awareness . There are just too many ethereal figures busy being symbolic in generalized landscapes . And among the faux-Bosch conjunctions of human and animal form , none is outlandish enough to make us gawk in amazement as Bosch 's do . ( The unwavering gaze of Giorgio Morandi 's still lifes and the pulsating space of Cezanne 's late landscapes produce more believable sensations of mystical participation in the real . ) <p> Her style , the high-art prototype of much psychedelia and kitschy sci-fi illustration , is always in the way , pretending to be a window onto something magical . " The task of the right eye , " she once wrote , " is to peer into the telescope , while the left eye peers into the microscope .

In this version , she invites a talking hyena to take her place at the ball with grisly , yet laughable consequences . The story 's folktale improbability and Kafkaesque matter- of-factness make a potent combination . <p> In her short writings , in contrast to her paintings , Carrington does not let the apparatus of representation trip her up . <p> Much is made of the fact that Carrington has studied the folklore and beliefs of various cultures . And some of the renewed interest in her work is because of scholars ( such as Chadwick ) investigating the neglected contributions of women to modern art . <p> CARRINGTON has won some enthusiasts by putting some goddess iconography into her work . But even if you cotton to her visual style , she remains an artist who aimed at a symbolic synthesis that her public is unequipped to decode . Artists of greater gifts  --  William Blake , for example  --  failed in similar ambitions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use symbols mindfully and unmanipulatively seems to be a mark of our age and culture , which is still defended against the intellectual force of psychoanalysis , one of its founding discoveries . It would n't surprise me if curing that incapacity became more important as a new century grinds toward us . Perhaps Carrington 's art and life may be an important case study in that project .
