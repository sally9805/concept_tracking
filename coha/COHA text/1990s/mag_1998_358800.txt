The editors of the New Republic , the famously vociferous magazine of Washington opinion , like to think of themselves as a gimlet-eyed bunch . But when it came to reporter Stephen Glass , their vision was blurred . They regarded Glass , an eager and soft-spoken young man of 25 , as a rare talent , able to land the kind of juicy fly-on-the-wall stories that make editors light up . " Steve was someone who could get into rooms other reporters could n't get into , and come away with quotes and anecdotes the others could n't get , " says Glass 's mentor , former New Republic editor Michael Kelly . <P> Glass was n't just good at getting into those rooms ; he was good at inventing them . He appears to be something rare in journalism : a genuine con man who made up not just quotations but people , corporations , legislation  --  even a " National Memorabilia Convention " ( " held last weekend in Rockville , Md. " ) , where vendors hawked such Lewinsky-related items as an inflatable Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagiarist is a familiar journalistic type , but the serial fabulist is rare . Glass concocted story after story and slipped them all past his editors and fact checkers , often buttressing his claims with forged notes and interview transcripts and other bogus documents . His work was challenged from time to time  --  a March 1997 account of a cocaine-fueled orgy at a young-conservatives conference was hooted at loudly  --  but his career sailed on , with free-lance contracts from a fistful of magazines . <P> Until last week . A reporter at the online magazine Forbes Digital Tool tried to verify Glass 's latest effort , the lovingly detailed story of a pimply 15-year-old computer hacker recruited by the corporation whose data network he had just penetrated . The piece features vivid characters ( a " super-agent to the super-nerds , " who is said to represent 300 hackers ) , a trade association called the National Assembly of Hackers and a California software firm called Jukt Micronics . None of it is real . When Digital Tool started asking questions , Glass created a phony corporate website for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's cell phone . <P> New Republic editor Charles Lane fired Glass and began a review of the 40 articles he had written for the magazine since December 1995 . So far , the magazine has retracted three of them and admitted that part of a fourth is also bogus . Editors at the magazine have found many other obvious fictions , ranging from cults that venerate unlikely politicians ( " The First Church of George Herbert Walker Christ " ) to phony interest groups ( an " Association for the Advancement of Sound Water Policy " ) . In one story , Glass told readers he had made up a town  --  " Werty , Iowa "  --  to test the speciousness of a policy group . What he did n't say was that he had made up the policy group too . <P> " We had a scorpion in our shirt , " says Lane . " Glass is a man without honor who operated out of hostility and contempt ; he has no place in journalism . I 've been racking my brain trying to understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
