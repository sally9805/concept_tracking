The left-right smooch-in <p> Last November budget director Richard Darman made derisive jokes about his gangly White House colleague Jim Pinkerton 's concept of the " new paradigm , " describing it as " neo-neoism . " A year later it 's still easy to laugh when Pinkerton rattles about the new paradigm as the political embodiment of cultural " postmodernism , " saying that bureaucracy was the " old gesellschaft " that went with modernism , while today a " deep Jungian atavism " among young high techies for a clean environment , close family ties , and healthy communities is creating a " new gemeinschaft " that will require a " new gesellschaft . " " The challenge , " Pinkerton said recently , " is to . apply a principled eclecticism in learning from the modern and pre-modern past to develop a new politics of the 1990s . " <p> This ca n't go anywhere , right ? Well , wrong . Pinkerton was speaking at a Washington conference jointly sponsored by the Reaganite - conservative Heritage Foundation and by the Progressive Policy Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential campaign . Several hundred people attended for most of a day , and a couple of other speakers with more accessible delivery styles predicted that whichever party embraces the " new paradigm " first-and , if possible , renames it - will dominate American politics for the next generation . <p> Washington has a few NPists : Bush Cabinet members Jack Kemp and Lamar Alexander and Representatives Newt Gingrich and Vin Weber among the Republicans , and Senators Bill Bradley and Joe Lieberman and Representatives Rob Andrews , Tom Downey , and Dave McCurdy among the Democrats . But Congress , the executive branch , and both national parties are still very much " old paradigm " - dominated by powerful bureaucracies , costly programs , centralized direction , and detailed regulation . Washington ideological battles - and press stories about politics - are conducted in terms of " left " and " liberal " ( meaning more funding for big government ) , " right " and " conservative " ( meaning less ) , and " center " or " moderate " ( meaning compromise , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth new way of thinking and governing that is emphatically not " moderate , " but that the Washington press still does n't get it . The NP movement has a presidential candidate , but it needs a congressional caucus that advances its ideas in legislative form . Some NP-inspired amendments do get passed , but no one recognizes them as such . <p> Out in the country , however , numerous new experiments are under way to ( in author David Osborne 's words ) " reinvent government " - by replacing civil servants with private vendors , central direction with citizen choice and localized management , government funding with vouchers , and direct regulation with financial rewards and penalties . Part of the new paradigm also is to replace entitlements such as welfare , which create dependency , with a system that offers opportunity for education but demands that recipients eventually take responsibility for themselves and go to work . <p> As Osborne and others describe it , the movement is bipartisan and cross-ideological . For instance , education vouchers and school " choice " are usually identified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly Williams , a black liberal Democrat , has pioneered a voucher plan to allow poor children to attend private schools and has won backing from Republican Governor Tommy Thompson . Liberal Democrat Rudy Perpich , as governor of Minnesota , instituted the first statewide school choice system in the country . The trend is gaining wide acceptance and with two sister ideas - school-based management and parental over-sight - has achieved apparently dramatic educational results in some places , such as East Harlem . <p> In Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley is partly dismantling the patronage empire erected by his father by privatizing services such as abandoned car removal and sewer cleaning . The outgoing director of the Chicago Housing Authority , Vince Lane , has achieved national fame for confiscating guns in housing projects and throwing out drug dealers ( arousing the ire of both the NRA and the ACLU ) and turning over management to tenant councils . In New York Andrew Cuomo , Mario 's son , runs a private housing program that provides cleaner and safer shelter at two-thirds the price of the government 's notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to reform radically the state 's civil service system , making it easier to fire unnecessary or inefficient employees . In Arkansas Clinton has instituted policies whereby school dropouts lose their driver 's licenses , parents are fined if they do not attend school conferences , and fathers of welfare dependents are pursued for child support . Various state and local efforts are under way to consolidate multiple poverty services in one place - the revived settlement house . <p> " New paradigm " politics is more than administrative tinkering . It has a history , albeit only ten or fifteen years ' worth . It is acquiring an ideology , or at least a set of values and principles , and one of these days it may develop into a coherent political movement . The Heritage-PPI conference , labeled " Left and Right , " was an exploration of the possibilities of convergence and cooperation among new " conservatives " and new " progressives . " One measure of the difficulties ahead is that Heritage vetoed the idea of calling the conference " Beyond Left and Right " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that NP Democrats instinctively disparage Ronald Reagan , while Republicans revere him ; Republicans favor capital gains tax cuts and Democrats want a more progressive redistribution of tax burdens ; and Democrats tend to like government , while Republicans think it 's at best a necessary evil . <p> New paradigm Democrats are direct descendants of the so-called " Atari Democrats " and " neoliberals " of the late 1970s and early 1980s who began to see that the party 's New Deal coalition , interest-group politics , and Great Society programs were losing relevance . Gary Hart and Richard Gephardt were early advocates of " new thinking , " but neoliberalism has been unable to prevail in a party heavily influenced by public employee unions and recipients of government benefits . New thinkers and moderates fed up with quadrennial drubbing by the Republicans formed the Democratic Leadership Council , headed until recently by Clinton . The PPI is the DLC 'S research arm . The term " New Paradigm " comes from Thomas Kuhn 's 1962 classic The Structure of Scientific Revolutions . It was applied to government by Osborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adapting from Kuhn , used it first in February 1989 . <p> New paradigm Republicans really are a new breed-mainly former Reaganites who have discovered that government is useful in addressing some social problems . Education Secretary Alexander , the former reformist governor of Tennessee , has George Bush 's blessing in advancing " new paradigm " ideas . Kemp has less support in pushing expensive schemes for tenant ownership of public housing , and he is arousing the ire of White House chief of staff John Sununu for championing a tax-cutting " growth package " to fight the recession . Pinkerton , 33 years old , is especially isolated . He is deputy head of Bush 's domestic policy staff , but his ideas are generally disregarded by his bosses ( Vice President Dan Quayle is an exception ) , and even his allies consider him " pretentious " and some of his theoretics " fatuous " and " childish . " On the other hand , translated into plain English , some of his thoughts make sense . There just may be a " postindustrial " sensibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This September , in a speech to the Illinois New Paradigm Society , Pinkerton said that America could not compete in the twenty-first century with " modern " government trying to manage " postmodern " society . He and other NPists claim that this disconnect is partly responsible for the popular rebellion against government , whether it takes the form of tax revolts , term limit fever , lagging voter participation , or David Duke . <p> So , what 's " postmodern " ? Pinkerton says , " Network TV is modern - you watch what they put on . Cable is postmodern - you have a choice . The postal service is modern . Faxing and electronic mailing are postmodern . Plastic surgery is modern . Staying out of the sun is postmodern .. Keeping the Dead Sea Scrolls secret for more than forty years is modern . Using a computer to reaggregate the concordance to re-engineer and then publish the text so that everyone can read it is postmodern . " Pinkerton also thinks that " gay marriage is postmodern " because it combines the libertarian idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no convergence among conservative and liberal NPers on abortion-Pinkerton and most Democrats are pro-choice , but Kemp is not - but there is on family values . At the Heritage - PPI conference , both right and left speakers agreed that government ought to do all it can to reverse the trend whereby 50 percent of all children now spend some of their growing-up years living with just one parent . <p> Pinkerton carries around in his billfold a quote from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that " the central conservative truth is that culture , not politics , determines the success of a society . The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself . " Moynihan , who first recognized the link between family breakdown and poverty and who understood ahead of most everyone else that Great Society welfare programs had " unintended consequences , " may have been the original " new paradigm " politician . But there are others now , even in Congress . Downey , for example , fought the liberal Children 's Defense Fund on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care bureaucracy , with parallel bureaucracies at the state level , or to give working-poor families an earned income tax credit to enable them to choose and buy their own child care , from a church if they wanted . Downey won . McCurdy fought with the administration and with the judiciary committees of both houses to win approval of a Police Corps , whereby students can get their college education paid for in return for four years ' service walking beats . Almost all NPers in Congress favor the U.S.-Mexico Free Trade Agreement . <p> Where can all this go ? If Pinkerton is right and there 's a new sensibility at work in the country , it will inevitably prevail in one form or another . But it will prevail more swiftly and smoothly if the left NP and the right NP can cooperate and move " beyond . " It will also help if the NP acquires a vocabulary that is accessible to ordinary Americans . NP may mean " choice " to the elites who promote it , but voters wo n't choose it unless they understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of language most Americans understand . <p> By Morton Kondracke <p>
