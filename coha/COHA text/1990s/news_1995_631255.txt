<p> STRANGE DAYS ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Lenny Nero Ralph Fiennes <p> Lornette " Mace " Mason Angela Bassett <p> Faith Justin Juliette Lewis <p> Max Peltier Tom Sizemore <p> Directed by Kathryn Bigelow . Written by James Cameron and Jay Cocks . Story by Cameron . Running time : 145 minutes . Rated R ( for intense disturbing violence , sexuality and pervasive strong language ) . Opening today at local theaters . <p> We know we want it . We want to see through other people 's eyes , have their experiences , stand in their shoes . That 's the unspoken promise of the movies , and as the unsettling prospect of computer-generated virtual reality creeps closer , it is possible that millions now living will know exactly what it feels like to be somebody else . <p> " Strange Days , " which takes place on the last two days of 1999 , shows us a Los Angeles torn by crime and violence , where the ultimate high is to " jack in " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain wave transmitter that creates the impression that you are having someone else 's experiences . The squid software tapes the lives of other people and plays them back . The movie shows how it works in an opening scene of savage kinetic energy , as a tapehead goes along on an armed robbery , vicariously sharing the same experience until the robber falls off a rooftop to his death . <p> The tape is for sale , but Lenny Nero ( Ralph Fiennes ) does n't want to buy it . He does n't deal in " blackjack "  --  the word for snuff films . This is a scruple " Strange Days " does not share , and some of its scenes are deeply disturbing , involving the audience as voyeurs during scenes of death . But is n't that what we do during all the thrillers we attend ? Get entertained by the sight of violent action ? By making the process explicit , " Strange Days " requires us to think about it , which is more than all but a few movies can or attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands midway between the futuristic nightmare of " Blade Runner " and the mean streets of 1940s film noir . Roaming gangs rule the city . Armored limousines protect the rich . Santa gets mugged on Hollywood Boulevard . " Jacking in " is the new drug of choice , and Lenny Nero is addicted to it himself ; he likes to play back tapes of happier days , when he was still with Faith ( Juliette Lewis ) , the woman he loved . The camera caresses Fiennes ' face during these VR sessions ; his face reveals surrender to pleasure as he forgives himself everything . <p> But Faith has split . Now she belongs to Philo Gant ( Michael Wincott ) , who manages rock stars , including Jeriko One , who was " one of the most important black men in America "  --  until he was shot dead , inspiring riots . Lenny wants her back . He also needs money , desperately . Fiennes plays him as a wheedling con man , forever offering " the Rolex off my wrist " to tough guys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be a cop , but now he 's a loser , surviving by selling contraband tapes and not asking too many questions about how the " playback " was obtained . <p> Lenny leads us into grungy nightclubs and scummy hotels , dealing with the pathetic needs of his customers . In a set-up scene in a club , he sells playback to a timid businessman , seductively explaining the technology ( " This is not like TV , only better . This is like a piece of someone 's life  --  straight from the cerebral cortex " ) . He lets him have a taste , and we see the mark 's face as he turns soft and narcissistic ; he thinks he 's a teenage girl having a shower . Then Lenny points out a couple dancing on the other side of the room . " How 'd you like to be him ? How 'd you like to have a hot girlfriend like that ? How 'd you like to be her ? " <p> The movie is a technical tour de force . Director Kathryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special-effects artists create the vision of a city spinning out of control . Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti 's point-of-view shots are virtuosic ( especially one in which a character falls from a roof in an apparently uninterrupted take ) . The pacing is relentless , and the editing , by Howard Smith , creates an urgency and desperation . <p> Working from a screenplay by Jay Cocks and James Cameron ( director of the " Terminator " films ) , Bigelow turns scenes like this into a critique of the central paradox of virtual reality : You can not share someone else 's reality without abandoning your own . As the " virgin brain " in the nightclub experiences the sample tape , he watches  --  and we watch him , defenseless and without inhibition . <p> It 's creepy . <p> Other scenes go much further , exploring more twisted horrors . In one , which is disturbing and graphic , a man attacks a female victim after first forcing her to wear the headpiece  --  so that she experiences her own death through his eyes . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sad and distressing than the more graphic scenes of violence we see all the time in the movies : Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening ; she forces her audience to deal with the screen reality , instead of allowing us to process it as routine " action . " <p> The plot is in the noir tradition , with updates out of recent headlines . Although Jeriko One 's murder has pushed the city into anarchy , Lenny Nero 's priorities are private . He wants to raise some money , maybe because that will increase his stature in Faith 's eyes . Nero gains a companion for his quest : Mace ( Angela Bassett ) , who drives an armored limo , and met Lenny when her husband was murdered . He was the cop who comforted her kids . She sees through his scam-artist 's facade and saves his skin . <p> " Strange Days " does three things that will make it a cult film . It creates a convincing future landscape ; it populates it with a hero who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than simply heroic , and it provides a vocabulary . Look for " tapehead , " " jacking in " and the movie 's spin on " playback " to appear in the vernacular . <p> At the same time , depending more on mood and character than logic , the movie backs into an ending that is completely implausible . The police commissioner 's sudden appearance on the scene is miraculous . And Bigelow begins a riot and then forgets about it , segueing into a New Year 's Eve celebration as if you can turn off anarchy like water from a tap . <p> What stays from the movie are not the transient plot problems , however , but the overall impact . This is the first movie about virtual reality to deal in a challenging way with the implications of the technology . It 's fascinating the way Bigelow is able to suggest so much of VR 's impact ( and dangers ) within a movie  --  a form of VR that 's a century old . As the character Faith observes : " One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up , and you know it 's over . "
