Bob Dole says he trusts in the hard way , and well he might , hailing from the garden of pressed sand called western Kansas , where the weather 's hard , the water 's hard , and anything that comes easy probably is n't worth having . This way , the hard way , says Dole , is the only way he has ever got anything and anywhere in this life . It is how he swallowed his pride as he and his family moved into the basement of his boyhood home so that oilmen could move in above them . How he came home from World War II not alive or dead but in-between , boxed and crated in a plaster cast , shot up in so many places that he was reduced at 21 to a second infancy , learning all over again how to walk , eat , dress himself with clip-on ties and laceless shoes . How he fought his way from county attorney to Senate leader , driving for miles , stopping in front of every swaying porch lamp to beg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice . " How he has triumphed in spite of his epithets : hatchet man , Nixon 's water boy , tax collector for the welfare state , the Senator from Archer Daniels Midland , the Old Man . And , finally , how he believes he will wrench the presidency away from an opponent whose relative youth and ease and liquid empathy conspire to make Dole look old and stiff and all alone . <P> So even if Bob Dole were 20 points ahead of Bill Clinton this week ( instead of the other way around ) , he probably would n't believe the polls or , if he did , would n't put much faith in them anyway . He knows less about living than about coming back from the dead . As the sky falls and his allies fret and his party balks and the polls sink , he alone remains calm . He takes pride in the very habits that people around him are desperate to change . And he 's not afraid of the dark , because he has been here before . <P> His critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start that he was the symbol of the G.O.P. 's blind faith in primogeniture , a front runner who can not win ; that he 's a mid-20th century man at the lip of the 21st century ; that there is no room for a relic in a church that worships youth ; that one ca n't be tongue-tied and taciturn in the age of confession . Sometimes the hard way builds muscles , sows compassion , tests courage . But sometimes the hard way is just the wrong way . <P> The high and low points of Dole 's campaign to date are nearly impossible to explain without some archaeology into the soil he sprang from and the paths he traveled to get here . We all have the defects of our qualities . In Dole 's case , the very traits that help account for his successes  --  the cutting wit , the stubborn independence , the refusal to ask for help even when stakes are highest  --  also produced the more horrible moments of this campaign , when he seemed to be running for some other office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says one of his primary rivals , " Dole 's campaign is a reflection of Dole . " <P> " I HAVE COME BACK FROM THE DEAD "
