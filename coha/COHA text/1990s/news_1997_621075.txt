<p> BORIS BECKER was enjoying a 120- mph cruise along a West German autobahn many years ago when his car broke down . He was the most revered and best- known athlete in his homeland , but now he was standing in utter darkness on a lonely highway , hitchhiking like a common drifter . <p> The notion intrigued him . " I am not Boris Becker now , " he remembers thinking to himself . " I am a tall guy in a black leather jacket . Who stops for me ? " <p> It turned out to be a Czech truck driver , en route to the Netherlands and without the slightest clue of Becker 's identity . " Suddenly I thought , ' Now you 're really alone , no one knows where you are , ' " said Becker . " ' You could simply disappear . ' This thought fascinated me tremendously . The temptation was immense . " <p> Within that story lies an essential element of Becker 's character . He did not disappear that night . He did n't wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughs who had never seen a tennis match . But he considered it . He took a very hard look at the other side . He examined his fame , wealth , good looks and glory and realized there is much more to the world . <p> If we are to take Becker at his word , he will be playing his last Grand Slam tournament next week as the U.S. Open unfolds at Flushing Meadow and the new Arthur Ashe Stadium . It will be the scene of high drama on many fronts : Pete Sampras ' relentless pursuit of legend , Andre Agassi 's comeback , the rebuilding of Monica Seles ' psyche and the formidable presence of world No. 1 Monica Hingis against a stellar field including teenage stars Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova . But nothing captures a major tournament quite like a farewell , and Becker 's matches will bear the heavy burden of nostalgia . <p> They come in all forms , these swan songs . Bjorn Borg left the U.S. Open grounds through a kitchen one night and never returned to big-time tennis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultation . Martina Navratilova kissed the sweet green grass of Wimbledon . Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe never really left , somehow . And last year 's Open belonged to the great Stefan Edberg , the game 's most elegant champion since the Australian heyday of the ' 50s and ' 60s . <p> Like all of those players , Becker owns a singular place in the game 's history . He was the gentleman warrior , diving all-out across the court , bleeding at the knees , then striking the appearance of a Bohemian poet in the postmatch press conference . Not that Becker was above gamesmanship or an occasional display of petulance , but stacked up against McEnroe , Connors , Ilie Nastase and other players who inspired the fans ' greatest passion , he was civil . He possessed a European brand of class and dignity . Speaking in precise , thoughtful English  --  his second language , after all  --  he offered a scholarly perspective . <p> When Becker took a shocking second-round loss to Peter Doohan in the 1987 Wimbledon , people were calling it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to get a sense of his despair . And he told them , " I lost a tennis match . It was not a war . Nobody died . " <p> He first won Wimbledon in 1985 , at the tender age of 17 , and his engaging go-for-it style was a revelation , still absolutely fresh in the minds of those who witnessed it . Insiders told him to slow down , that there is longevity in the measured look , but he answered , " When you tell me that at 30-40 , I should n't hit my second serve very hard , I wonder , ' Why not ? ' I was feeling good , the birds were singing , and I really wanted to make that point , so why not go for it ? " <p> He said he 's never been consumed by money  --  and proved it , turning down countless millions over the years because he did not believe in the product or the event or the people in charge . " I prefer simple things , " he once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me happy . Or when I walk through a supermarket . I bought a toaster today and that made me happy . " <p> While other players made a habit of destroying lesser players in the early rounds , Becker was seldom on the front end of those 6-0 , 6-1 massacres . " I 'm not brutal enough , " he would explain . " For me , 6-4 is sufficient . I like narrow fights . After a 6-0 , 6-0 match you 've had your skin pulled up over your ears and you 're done for . That 's below one 's dignity . " <p> They asked him once to define himself , and he answered , " A man who is simply a human being , not bound by many obligations , with no logos on his clothes  --  absolutely free . " <p> Because we knew all this about Becker , he became an even more compelling figure . We knew that Becker had defied a savagely racist element in his native Germany by marrying a black woman , American Barbara Feltus . We knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming headlines like " Why , Boris ? Why Not One of Us ? " We knew that he had replied , " I am more typical of the new Germany , the nation in which the army is breaking down because nobody wants to go . This is a time for young people who have more open minds . " <p> And each time he took the court , he seemed a little more interesting than before . One great title escaped him  --  the French Open , the same nemesis that plagued Edberg , McEnroe and Connors and haunts Sampras to this day . But Becker won three Wimbledons , two Australian Opens and the 1989 U.S. Open when he survived two match points against the dashing Derrick Rostagno in the second round ( I can still see one of those points , a forehand passing shot that clipped the net-cord and trickled over to Rostagno 's side ) . He led his country to two unforgettable championships in the Davis Cup . And there were other matches , on the slightly smaller stage , that stay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredible five-set battle for the ATP Tour Championship . Sampras pulled it out , but he said , " This is one of the best matches I 've ever been a part of . I think Boris is the only guy in tennis where I look across the net sometimes and see a more skilled player than me . " <p> To which Becker replied , " Pete is the finest player of all time . Matches like that keep me in the game longer and longer . At the end , it almost did n't matter for me who won . " <p> For every epic battle against Sampras , however , there were a dozen Becker injuries and another dozen absurd losses . A palpable fatigue has appeared in Becker over the years . His gait seems arthritic at times ; the face looks haggard ; the eyes are hollow and blank . Boris looked that way at Wimbledon this year when he lost to Sampras and then announced he would never play those hallowed grounds again . He looked tired , frustrated and ready to quit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be playing his last Grand Slam next week , because he 's just 29 years old and could find rejuvenation in an extended layoff . There was the wonderful comment recently from Mary Carillo , who noted " the constant adolescent " in Becker . " He still loves to sound like some aging lion , then he gets a tennis racket in his hand and the child overwhelms the adult . " <p> But he 's a very old 29 . Few athletes have lived so well , so successfully , under so much controversy , in such a short time . When Becker watches Michael Jordan and wistfully concludes , " Sometimes the last days are the best days , " there is a strong message within . <p> These are the last days for Boris Becker , and while his U.S. Open history suggests a less-than-triumphant farewell , we should all stop next week to acknowledge this man who brought us so in touch with our emotions . Wherever he 's headed , let 's hope there is privacy in a distant room , that a simple toaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he is absolutely free .
