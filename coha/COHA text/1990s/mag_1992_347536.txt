THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS A POWERFUL DEfense against assaults by bacteria and viruses from outside the body , but now scientists may have found a way to turn it against a homegrown assailant : cancer . A research group at Stanford University has developed a vaccine that stimulates the body to fight B-cell lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system that strikes 20,000 Americans every year and is especially hard to treat . They did it by removing cancerous cells from nine patients and treating the cells to make them more irritating to the immune system . Then they were reinjected under the patients ' skin . In two cases , as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine , tumors actually shrank , while five other patients showed markedly increased immune-system activity . The vaccine is n't a preventive and can only be used on a single patient and against this type of cancer . But the technique may someday be used on other cancers and also on such diseases as multiple sclerosis , diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
