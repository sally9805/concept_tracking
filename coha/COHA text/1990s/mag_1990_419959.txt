Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS As outrage grows over the cost of the thrift bailout , the political blame game heats  --  up and the president 's son is a lightning rod <p> Neil Bush faced a hard choice last January . Federal regulators had offered the president 's son a deal . They would reduce the charges stemming from his involvement in Silverado , a failed savings and loan in Colorado . All Bush had to do was sign an agreement pledging never again to violate S &L; rules . But in his mind the decree amounted to an admission of guilt that would likely haunt him if he followed his plan to enter politics someday . After days of deliberation , Bush announced to friends and family that he was going to fight . " To sign a piece of paper , even one as meaningless as this may be , would imply I did something wrong , " he said . " I sleep soundly at night knowing I live an honest life . " <p> Whatever inner need that decision served , it has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so rough last week that an unnamed GOP operative declared that Bush " is going to become the Savings and Loan poster child . " Instead of closing the book on the Neil Bush case , the Office of Thrift Supervision pressed ahead . OTS officials released 1,000 pages of documents from the case last week and alleged that Neil Bush engaged in " one of the worst kinds " of conflicts of interest while serving as a director of Silverado . Ignoring the counsel of his father 's political advisers , Bush spent the week aggressively defending himself in media interviews , but only seemed to worsen matters by acknowledging he had gotten " an incredibly sweet deal . " In an emotional press conference , President Bush promised not to interfere with the legal system . But he insisted , " What father would n't express a certain confidence in the honor of his son ? " <p> The timing could n't be worse . In recent weeks , taxpayers have begun to fathom that the S &L; crisis would cost $500 billion over 40 years  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included not just an anonymous group of fat cats and negligent politicians , but the president 's own son . A NEWSWEEK Poll found most Americans believe that George Bush has handled the S &L; crisis " not so well or poorly " and that Neil 's involvement is at least somewhat damaging to his father . <p> After simmering for five years as a financial crisis , the S &L; mess has exploded as a political issue . For months Democrats had avoided casting blame , fearing they would be skewered in return . But in recent trips home , legislators were startled by the vehemence of public reaction . " I ca n't ride down the street , I ca n't go down an elevator , I ca n't walk into an airport without a citizen coming up to me about S &Ls,"; says Sen. Howard Metzenbaum . Neil Bush 's involvement emboldened the Democrats to attack , providing a way to blame his father for the S &L; crisis and hit a broader populist message at the same time . Neil Bush was " the embodiment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Democratic Party spokesman Mike McCurry . A GOP strategist conceded that " Neil Bush draws blood on our side for the first time . " <p> Democrats last week were busy trying to look like reformers . Lawmakers were practically bumping each other off the platform in the Senate TV studio to boast about a crime bill they passed giving life prison sentences to convicted S &L; " kingpins . " Rep. Patricia Schroeder called for an independent counsel to investigate Neil Bush . House Democratic leaders quietly objected to the demand , recognizing that the prosecutor might turn on prominent Democrats . <p> The fact is , of course , that Congress helped cause the crisis by loosening financial laws and blocking regulators from seizing sick S &Ls; early on . Democratic Rep. Frank Annunzio of Illinois , who now sports a six-inch " Put the S &L; Crooks in Jail " button , demonstrated the risks of hypocrisy last week when he held a press conference to question whether regulators went easy on Silverado because of " a donation of hush money " to the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scandal . A recipient of $51,620 in campaign donations from the thrift industry from 1981 to 1990 , Annunzio pushed regulators to ease up on S &Ls; during the 1980s . Bluntly put , Annunzio was far more responsible for the S &L; tab than Neil Bush . <p> Lavish parties : In many ways , the intense focus on Neil Bush is unfair . Other events last week served as reminders that he was a bit player in the crisis . Prosecutors indicted Edwin T. McBirney of Dallas , a high roller who reportedly threw lavish parties featuring strippers and elephants as his Sunbelt Savings Association lurched toward insolvency . Party guests remember him holding aloft loan contracts at some galas , shouting , " Anybody want to borrow $100,000 ? We can make a deal right on the spot . " ( McBirney 's lawyers say he 's an innocent man being made a " political football " by prosecutors . ) <p> Politics aside , what exactly did Neil Bush do ? His most embarrassing act was not one the OTS even considered a violation of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 from business associate Kenneth Good  --  which he never paid back . That 's not quite as bad as it sounds . Bush never actually got a penny . Good loaned the money to Bush on the condition that he spend it on one of Good 's risky investments . If the investment had blossomed , Bush would have paid back the loan but kept the profit . As it happened , it fizzled so Bush did n't get anything . That 's not to say it was n't an incredibly sweet deal ; a no-risk investment does n't drop in everyone 's lap . <p> The government 's formal charges focused on Bush 's actions from 1985 , when Silverado chairman Michael Wise made him a board member , to 1988 , when Bush resigned . The OTS alleges that Bush acted in " a manner likely to cause abnormal risk to Silverado " when he voted to give loans to or buy property from Bill L. Walters , a major Denver developer . Walters ultimately caused $50 million in losses to Silverado  --  at the same time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have disclosed this business relationship . While acknowledging he did n't fill out the proper forms , Bush says the other directors did know about his business ties to Walters and that Colorado law did n't bar him from voting . Even so , the OTS says it was a breach of duty to vote on a deal involving a partner . <p> Bush also encouraged Silverado to authorize a $900,000 line of credit to Good . Bush notes that in this case he abstained from voting on the transaction and informed the board that he had a business relationship with Good . But , OTS says , Bush neglected to tell the board that his company was a partner in the very project the $900,000 was helping . Bush claims this again is a petty dispute over disclosure . Bush was only spared further charges because the venture never actually used the $900,000 . Even with full disclosure , S &Ls; are n't supposed to give their own directors large loans . <p> The OTS charges that Bush did n't set the record straight when Good told the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to reschedule $11.5 million in loans . At the time Good was pleading poverty he was also promising Bush $3.1 million in another deal . Bush says the board fully understood Good 's finances . <p> Is Bush being singled out because he 's the president 's son ? The OTS does n't usually bring complaints against suspects who have left the board of directors . But when regulators file lawsuits after taking over insolvent banks they generally do sue the outside directors . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is reportedly close to bringing a $200 million suit against Silverado . Experts in such Going along : Bush seems emblematic of a type of secondary player in the scandal  --  the people who furthered the crisis through negligence , insider abuse or naive complicity . " It is appropriate to scrutinize Bush because he represents a major class of people who contributed to the disaster by going along with it , " says a key regulator who helped uncover the S &L; scandal . <p> If President Bush is n't tarred by his son 's troubles he may still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Resolution Trust Corporation ( RTC ) , responsible for selling insolvent thrifts , has moved too slowly and allowed bonanzas to entrepreneurs taking over the failed institutions . Metzenbaum last week complained that in selling 15 thrifts to the Bluebonnet Savings Bank in Dallas back in 1988 , regulators gave $1.8 billion in subsidies to James Fail  --  a man whose company had pleaded guilty to a securities-law felony and who is now under investigation by insurance regulators . Metzenbaum questioned whether the government helped Fail because they were lobbied by Robert Thompson , a former Bush aide representing Bluebonnet . A spokesman for Fail and Thompson said Bluebonnet offered the best bid and has run the thrifts efficiently . <p> The unfortunate truth is that the government may have to pump billions more to prop up sickly thrifts . It may also be that many S &L; looters will get away with crimes that are too complicated for juries to understand . Voters will have to face up to the fact that much of the money is gone . Ironically , public outrage has moved lawmakers to toughen financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important reform of all : changing the campaign-finance system that helped fuel the scandal . <p> Although the S &L; crisis is at least five years old , it is still in its infancy . Nearly every congressional district will soon have teams of muckrakers and political operatives searching for clues that link local officials or businessmen to the debacle . " There 's more new stuff in this than there was in Watergate , " says a GOP operative . " You 've got stories coming from 50 states . " It may turn out that the gun-shy politicians who earlier warned colleagues away from this issue may have been right after all . <p> By Steven Waldman with Rich Thomas , Eleanor Clift and Ann McDaniel in Washington and Ginny Carroll in Huston <p> THE S &L; SPIRAL <p> The figures on the S &L; crisis continue to spiral upward as the political controversy grows .
