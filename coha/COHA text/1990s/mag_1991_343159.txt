When General Norman Schwarzkopf was asked to evaluate Saddam Hussein as a military leader last week , the allied commander telegraphed his answer with a derisive " Ha ! " Then , with studied scorn , Schwarzkopf elaborated , " He is neither a strategist , nor is he schooled in the operational art , nor is he a tactician , nor is he a general , nor is he a soldier . Other than that , he 's a great military man . " <P> Because of the huge number of men and weapons Saddam poured into Kuwait , many military observers expected him to fight more effectively and inflict many more casualties than he did . As Schwarzkopf recounted at his wrap-up briefing , Iraqi combat forces outnumbered the coalition 's 2 to 1 on the battlefield . In addition , the Iraqis had many more tanks and artillery pieces and had carefully dug them in . <P> The general 's detailed account of the campaign was a pointed reminder that simple comparisons of numbers are of limited use in predicting a war 's outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic mistakes that proved Saddam 's military ineptitude . <P> The first , analysts now agree , was his failure to press ahead last Aug. 3 after his Republican Guard overran Kuwait . If Iraq 's million-man army had gone on to invade Saudi Arabia and the gulf states , the whole shape of the struggle could have been different . " At that time there were no American forces in the area , " says Andrew Duncan , assistant director of London 's International Institute of Strategic Studies . " Saddam 's troops could have swept down the . gulf , toppling one state after another . " <P> Says a senior Pentagon officer : " Had Iraq occupied Saudi ports and airfields , the ( ( allied ) ) buildup as we know it would have been impossible . " If Saddam had seized control of so much of the region 's oil , fears of devastating price rises or of losing supplies altogether might have deterred the allies from even considering the use of force against Iraq . <P> Having stopped at the Saudi border , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared it the 19th province of Iraq and concentrated more and more of his troops  --  535,000 eventually  --  on its soil or just north of the Kuwait-Iraq frontier . Apparently he hoped to refight his past war , the eight-year contest of attrition with Iran , battling from behind elaborate fortifications and minefields , with armored reserves quickly deployable to seal off enemy breakthroughs . <P> Saddam was so preoccupied with the defense of Kuwait that he did not extend his defensive line of berms , razor wire and mines more than a few miles west of the Kuwait frontier that faces Saudi Arabia . The struggle for Kuwait , he said in January , would finally depend on " the soldier who comes with rifle and bayonet to fight the soldier in the battle trench . " In that , he boasted , " we are people with experience . "
