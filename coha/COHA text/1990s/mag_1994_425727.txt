The New Gold Standard The Fed has too much else on its mind to be bothered controlling inflation . But that can be changed . <p> BRETTON WOODS is really a metaphor for gold and price stability , " said Jack Kemp as he launched an Empower America conference commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the postwar global monetary pact . Indeed , John Maynard Keynes , one of the architects of the Bretton Woods agreement , told the House of Lords that it was " the exact opposite " of a return to the classical gold standard . <p> Kemp  --  the only prominent national politician who understands the complexities of monetary policy  --  stopped way short of calling for a full return to the Bretton Woods system , wherein the dollar was convertible to gold at $35 per ounce and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar . Instead , Kemp , who is poised to announce a 1996 presidential bid immediately following this year 's elections , is searching for a new approach that will promote economic growth by ensuring low inflation , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably see . Often accused of being a big-government conservative , Kemp knows full well that the power of government finance ministries and their central banks is dwarfed by the awesome power of global financial markets , driven by high-tech information processing , where daily dollar transaction flows total well over $1 trillion . <p> The subject of money is a timely one , as the U.S. economy again shows signs of rising inflation . The producer price index has increased at a 4.5 per cent annual rate over the past three months , after remaining flat for all of last year . The consumer price index rose at a 3.7 per cent annual rate for the three months ending in August , following a 2.7 per cent 1993 performance . Anticipating inflation , long-term Treasury-bond yields have moved up to 7.7 per cent , compared to 5.75 per cent nearly a year ago . The Eurodollar market expects short-term rates , which are now just under 5 per cent , to rise to 5.75 per cent in December and 6.5 per cent by next June . The overall stock-market averages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market over 70 per cent of the S &P; 500 listings have fallen at least 20 per cent from their highest level . Gold is again flirting with $400 , and gold stocks are one of the hottest performing groups . Broad commodity indexes are very bearish on the inflation outlook : the Journal of Commerce index of raw materials has risen at a 25 per cent annual rate over the past six months , and the Dow - Jones spot index is up 24 per cent from a year ago . A Wobbly Model <p> ONCE AGAIN a bout of inflation threatens to disrupt the economy . However , a return to the old Bretton Woods system is not the answer . Bretton Woods ' creators , Keynes and Harry Dexter White , both believed strongly in the benign intervention of government and would not have understood any better than Bill Clinton and his wrecking crew that next-century economics will be driven by market action , not government action . ( Not long after the Bretton Woods conference , White committed suicide rather than face charges that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , former Reagan Treasury economist Paul Craig Roberts presented a critique of Bretton Woods , reminding participants that it permitted many fluctuations and crises , especially from France and England . The signatories relied on exchange controls and tariffs to prevent sporadic outflows . Countries whose currencies had been weakened by anti-growth tax and regulatory policies were constantly borrowing to support their currencies , then would periodically throw in the towel and devalue anyway . In effect , any country could withdraw from the system at any time , without penalty or sanction . <p> Meanwhile , Bretton Woods ' other offspring , the IMF and the World Bank , were ruining the economies of Africa and Latin America . The twin banks also  --  by expanding paper money through the creation of special drawing rights ( SDRs ) and by a flood of new lending  --  helped to promote global inflation . What is more , the leading central banks , especially the U.S. Federal Reserve , never explicitly recognized the domestic-monetary-policy link to Bretton Woods , which was necessary to preserve the $35-per-ounce gold ratio or the foreign-currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. that inflated its way off the system , ringing the death knell in 1971 , when the gold window was formally closed . <p> In short , neither the U.S. Government nor any other was able to maintain the necessary discipline . Supporters of Bretton Woods ascribe the beginning of 1970s inflation to 1971 , when President Nixon formally terminated the system . In reality , the beginning of the end came in the middle 1960s , when the Fed created new dollars at a very rapid rate . Federal Reserve credit ( consisting mainly of the central bank 's portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities and loans to member banks ) which is the source of monetary-base dollar creation , increased at a 10.7 per cent yearly rate between 1963 and 1968 , double the pace of the previous five years . In response to this inflationary money growth , gold that was trading freely in the London market moved up from $35 to $43 per ounce , a 23 per cent rise , which correctly heralded the coming inflation . So did long-term Treasury yields , which moved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1965 and 1970 . The U.S. inflation rate , which averaged 1.6 per cent a year for the five years up to 1964 , promptly moved to a 5.4 per cent annualized pace for the four years to 1970 . All this occurred before the Bretton Woods system expired in 1971 . <p> Why ? Mainstream Keynesian economists continue to blame the 1970s inflation on Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society program of Vietnam guns and welfare-entitlement butter . As this story goes , the lack of fiscal discipline created huge deficits that subsequently drove up inflation . However , from 1965 to 1970 the budget deficit averaged a tiny $7 billion a year , or 1.1 per cent of gross domestic product . It was an excess of money , not deficits , that started the age of inflation . And this excess , corroborated by the rise in the private-market gold price , occurred despite the Bretton Woods system . <p> After 1971 , as gold completely disappeared from the official monetary scene , inflation raged among all the industrial countries . ( When gold was the reference point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3.8 per cent annual rate , and the consumer price index at 2.1 per cent . When gold was removed , economic performance from 1971 to 1993 slumped to 2.5 per cent growth with 6 per cent inflation . ) This undermined growth , capital formation , entrepreneurship , employment , financial markets , free trade , consumers , elderly pensioners , farmers , and the poor . Orthodox economists blamed greedy businessmen for raising prices , or ungrateful workers for demanding higher wages , or Arab sheiks for increasing oil prices ; even God was blamed for bad weather and poor harvests . But none of the orthodox attempts to curb inflation worked . Wage and price controls failed , higher taxes failed , monopolistic regulations failed , managed-exchange-rate schemes failed . They failed because the root cause of inflation was the printing of bad money . By government . <p> That 's right , government . The Federal Reserve is an arm of the U.S. Government , just as central banks everywhere are . And governments are not to be trusted . In the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Services is to social policy : it represents the narrow interest of elite Washington planners and their mistaken theories , not the grass-roots interests of the population at large . The latter wants stable money in order to invest , save , borrow , lend , trade , take risks , and prosper . The former want Keynesian fine-tuning , demand management , and economic control . <p> There are of course some in the Fed who have their ear closer to the ground , but even these good people get caught up in the prevailing ethos of Washington 's corridors of power , the infectious culture of big government . For all its alleged independence , the Fed is very much a part of this culture . aa <p> " Everything the government touches turns to c  --  . It 's a reverse Midas touch , " Craig Roberts told the somewhat startled conservatives at the Empower America conference . But why were these conservatives startled ? And why is it so difficult to recognize that the Bretton Woods system , designed by Keynes , was the perfect vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trust government to tax , or spend , or regulate . They abhor government interference with property rights , hiring policies , family values , or school curricula . Why should money be any different ? Good as Gold <p> TO RESTORE sound money and permanent price stability , a new system must be designed which places the private international gold market at the center . That gold is still the best inflation indicator , I have no doubt . If the Fed had heeded the message of the world gold market , then the U.S. and the rest of the world would not have been forced to suffer the consequences of repeated stop-and-go policies . The gold price signal worked in the Sixties and Seventies to warn of impending inflation , and it worked in the Eighties and Nineties to signal disinflation . It even picked up the mild reflation of the late Eighties , just as it is now signaling another reflation . <p> Private citizens today are permitted to own and contract for gold . Indeed , they are free to exchange dollars for gold , commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . In that important sense we are already on a new gold standard . And for those who remain uncomfortable with gold as the single instrument of policy , there is no reason why the Fed should not also monitor price movements in the international auction markets for bonds , commodities , and currencies . All send off early warning signals of inflation . <p> The trouble is , the Federal Reserve  --  and the Treasury  --  are not heeding the markets ' message . The authorities are still focused on economic variables such as unemployment , capacity utilization , retail sales , and real GDP , as if too much employment , or production , or growth will create inflation . But prosperity does not cause inflation ; bad money does . If money is sound , then people will hold it . If they hold it , then bond yields will fall , gold will be soft and commodities uneventful , and the dollar will rise . Call it the World Information Standard , or the New International Gold Standard , or the Bond Market Vigilantes . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money supply . <p> What is to be done ? We must take money out of the politicians ' hands . To achieve this , I propose a series of new monetary reforms . <p> First , the Humphrey - Hawkins Act must be amended to eliminate the directive of low unemployment and to make price stability the Fed 's sole objective . Printing more money will not reduce unemployment . Real purchasing power comes not from money creation but rather from profits , production , entrepreneurship , and risk taking . These are a function of low taxes , deregulation , free trade , and restrained federal spending , all of which permit proper incentives and returns for the private economy . The Fed 's rule should be preservation of steady dollar purchasing power and stable prices . Government can not and should not try to control the economy . <p> Second , price stability should be defined in terms of a specific inflation target ; I propose a 0 to 3 per cent range for the rate of change of the CPI . Inflation targets have been successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and France are on the verge of such targets . It is time for the Fed to surrender . A cost-of-living target is something the public understands . <p> Third , the Fed 's chairman and vice chairman should be given two years to meet this target . If after 24 months there is deflation , or above 3 per cent inflation , then they must resign . No position , no office , no parking spot , no tennis privileges . If the target is met , they may complete the remainder of their four-year terms . <p> Fourth , the Reserve Board must be subjected to strict term limits to avoid the Washingtonization trap . Right now board members are eligible to serve for 14 years . This is an outrage ; no one should be permitted such power for so long . Terms should be limited to six years . <p> Fifth , all Federal Reserve operations to buy and sell  --  whether government securities , or foreign currencies , or gold , or desk chairs and computers  --  must be publicly announced in advance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be in the business of favoring the New York financial community , as is now the case . <p> One additional point . Internally , the Fed should abandon control of the overnight federal-funds rate as a means of regulating Reserve Bank credit . Instead , the Fed should use global gold , commodity , financial , and currency market price signals . Let the overnight interest rate float according to market conditions . Right now , for example , the Fed fund rate is rising , but so are gold and commodity prices . This means policy is still too loose . Indeed , interest rates are rising because the Fed is inflating . Operationally , the Fed should be extinguishing dollars until the gold price falls back to around $325 . Sound as  --  a Dollar ? <p> WHAT I have described here is a domestic price rule , subject to a clear target and to public accountability . The ultimate goal is a stable cost-of-living price index and steady domestic dollar purchasing power . The supply of dollars will be calibrated to dollar demand by price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way back in 1944 , the economic journalist Henry Hazlitt wrote : " The first essential is a determination to make currencies sound within each country . . . . This can only be done by the maintenance of the value of the dollar in terms of gold , along with a sound national budget and other sound internal policies . " He was right then , but ignored . He is still right today . <p> There is no reason to " fix " international currencies , for central banks merely waste taxpayer money in a futile effort to buck world markets . Nations that raise taxes and impose regulations , or engage in protectionist trade practices , will suffer a falling exchange rate . If the Clinton Administration has its way on raising taxes and nationalizing health care , then the dollar will decline , as it has already done this year . On the other hand , nations that strengthen their private sector through fiscal incentives will see their currency appreciate . But each nation has a right to do as it wishes . Supranational governmental agencies must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations set a domestic inflation target , and use the international gold and financial markets as a disciplinary guide to meet it , then currencies will take care of themselves . This twenty-first-century monetary plan will create stable money and stronger growth , with low interest rates . Undergirding the system will be the information-efficient private global-market trading system , a populist and democratic expression of the free will of billions of people who are searching for prosperity and social progress . It will replace the perverse and destabilizing structure of government control and intervention .
