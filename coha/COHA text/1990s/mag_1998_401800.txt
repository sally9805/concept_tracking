The riht testing for colon cancer can save your life . Headnote What every woman needs to know . // It 's the second most deadly cancer , killing more people each year than breast or prostate cancer . Yet colon cancer does n't receive nearly as much attention . That 's partly because no one likes to talk about the body parts involved : namely , the large intestine , made up of the colon , a six-foot-long tube that removes water from digested food and expels solid waste ; and the rectum , the last six to eight inches of the large intestine . What 's more , no celebrity has gone public with a first-person account of the disease to raise awareness , as former First Lady Betty Ford did for breast cancer and General Norman Schwarzkopf did for prostate cancer . Manv women assume colon cancer strikes mostly the elderly-or men . But doctors are seeing younger and younger patients w , ith the disease , some of whom develop the illness early because of a genetic predisposition . And the cancer actually kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men . This year , about 67,000 womenand 64,600 men-will develop colon cancer , and 28,600 women and 27,900 men will die from it , according to the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) . The good news : With the right screening , the disease-technically known as colorectal cancer-can actually be prevented . " Widespread screening could save at least thirty-thousand lives a year , but sadly , very few get it , " says John Bond , M.D. , chief of gastroenterology at Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis . lore than half of women age 50 and over are now checked for breast cancer , but only about 24 percent of women age 50 and over have had their colon examined in the past five years , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta . Many of us put off testing , fearing it may be embarrassing or uncomfortable . But there 's plenty of blame to go around : Some doctors do n't tell us to get screened-and some insurance companies wo n't pay for the best testing . Three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 and over-the group with the highest rate of colon tumors-an astonishing 61 percent of women said their doctors had never advised any kind of screening . Many primary-care doctors are n't educated about the tremendous benefits of testing , according to Albert Palitz , M.D. , director of the colorectal cancer prevention program at Kaiser Permanente , a large California-based health maintenance organization . " Only in the last five years have studies provided clear evidence that screening can prevent death , " he notes . However , the ACS has supported colon-cancer screening for nearly two decades , issuing new guidelines last year ( see " Rating the Screening Tests , " page 190 ) . What makes the screening shortfall so troublesome is that colon cancer often produces no symptoms in its early stages , when it is 90 percent curable . If not detected , it typically goes unnoticed until it has spread beyond the intestines-at which point the five-year survival rate is less than 60 percent . The Best Protection Colon-cancer experts agree that the " gold standard " of screening is colonoscopy , a 15- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tumors using a lighted flexible tube with a cameralike device at one end . The device transmits images of the colon to a video screen , which the doctor watches throughout the procedure . Any polyps that are discovered can be removed during the test . Colonoscopy finds 97 percent of colon tumors , and the ACS now recommends it for cr.ervone age 50 and over . The unique advantage of colonoscopy is that it 's the only cancer test that can actually prevent malignancy . " There 's a very strong argument that people who have this test regularly will never , ever get colon cancer , which means it 's much better for preventing this disease than mammograms are for breast cancer , " says Robert J. Mayer , M .. D. , director of the Center for Gastrointestinal Oncology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston . " I , hat 's because virtually all colon cancers begin as mushroom-shaped or flat premalignant growths called polyps . " About five to ten percent may become cancerous , so if they 're found and removed during colonoscopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Guillem , MI.D. , associate attending colorectal surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City . It appears that one colonoscopy is enough to protect people at average risk for an entire decade , because polyps grow very slowly , taking about five to seven years to become the size of a pencil eraser , and up to seven more years to turn cancer ( us . Elizabeth Ely , 55 , an interior decorator in New York City , is grateful that she had a colonoscopy , because it saved her life . Although she did n't have a family history of colon cancer or any symptoms ( in fact , she felt great , she says ) , her doctor encouraged her to get tested because of her age . I , ast ltiarch , a colonoscopy revealed a malignant rectal tumor . " I was absolutely shocked , " she recalls . " I never believed anything would be wrong with me . I 've always been well . " She had surgery to remove the tumor , and was relieved to learn that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation . " I 'm very lucky , " says Ely . " Now I 'm telling my clients , friends , and relatives to have the test if they 're fifty or over . " Another , more famous survivor : former President Ronald Reagan , who had part of his intestines removed in 1985 after doctors discovered a malignant tumor through colonoscopy . What 's Your Life Worth ? Despite the lifesaving power of colonoscopy , Medicare and a number of other health plans wo n't pay for it . " This is unjust to the American public , " says Michael f ) . Moseson , MI.D. , a clinical assistant professor of surgery at Cornell University Medical College in New York . " F'eople get mammograms for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer . But most insurers do n't pay for the exam that can actually , rent disease . " Insurers did n't exactly volunteer to cover mammography either . In the 1970 's and early 1980 's , many health plans refused to pay for screening mammograms , and doctors often had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered . Starting in the mid1980 's , states began passing laws to force insurers to pay for the test , and it 's now a covered benefit in at least 4() states . // YOUR RISK AND YOUR AGE // YOUlR RISK AND YOUR FAMILY HISTORY // I Iealth plans typically restrict colonoscopy to people at high risk-those who have chronic intestinal problems , a family history of the disease , and/or actual symptoms , such as bleeding . " Ihe majority of insurers pay for several other coloncancer screening tests ( see " Rating the Screening " lests , " at right ) . Health plans contend that these tests have fewer complications and are cheaper than colonoscopy , which costs between $500 and $1,500 . They also maintain that colonoscopv is not well studied . " It 's a major leap to say colonoscopy is the better test without good evidence-based research , " insists Dr. I'alitz of Kaiser P'ermanente . " I'he ACS disagrees , saying there 's already compelling proof of colonox ; copy 's value , including a 1993 study showing that high-risk people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to develop colon cancer than people who did n't have the test . Although no large studies have been done to prove that colonoscopy saves the lives of people at average risk , fotr small studies published in the last seven years have demonstrated its usefi.illness : Precancerenis polyps were discovered in 25 to 41 percent of the symptom-free people who were tested ; so were several cancers . Such benefits more than justify the additional cost of colonoscopy , say advocates . Strong evidence that colonoscopy is cost-effective coomes from Eli l , illy and ( Company , the Indianapolis-based pharmutical corporation , which is conducting the largest community-based study ever of the test on people at average risk . Since 1 ' ' 3t ) 6 , Lilly has been paying for its employees , their spouses , and retirees to have a colonoscopy every five years , starting at age 40 ) . About 2,500 people have undergone screening to date , and 17 canccrs have been discovered . If the tumors had progressed , explains ( ; reg l , arkin , Nt.l ) . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cost the company more than $100,000 to treat each person . " lhat adds up to tremendous savings and a number of lives saved ! As recently as the 1980 's , there were serious concerns about colonoscopy 's risks , such as perforation of the colon and rectum . But as physicians have received better training and gained more experience , the test has become much safer . " Ioday , the risk of death from the pr ( ocedurc ; tire-at most , one in 10,000-pales in comparison to the risk of dying from colon cancer one in AX Experts hope that an even safer , but as yet experimental , procedure called virtual colonopy will prove similarly effective ( Because scientific evidence indicates that colonoscopy is the best screening test , Good Housekeeping believes that insurers should cover it for all people age 50 and over . If you agree , see page 21 to find out how you can help to achieve this goal , throuLh the GH Lobby . ) So when should you be screened ? " Ihat depends on your risk . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyps , or chronic intestinal problems , or any symptoms should start at age 50 , according to the ACS . If you 've had polyps or colon cancer in the past , you should have a colonoscopy every two to three years . And if you or a family member has had breast , ovarian , uterine , or prostate cancer , you may want to get a colonoscopy regardless of your age . The diseases have a strong genetic link , according to Randall W. Butt , M.l ) . , chief of gastroenterology at the University of Uitah Health Sciences Center in Salt Lake City . ( For more information , see " Your Risk and Your Family History , " page 188 . ) If you have a chronic intestinal condition like colitis or Crohn 's disease , start screening , at the latest , seven years after the condition was diagnosed , then every one to two years afterward .

Although this can be caused by hemorrhoids , it 's also a telltale sign of colon cancer . Pencil-thin stools or any persistent change in stool size .

Unusual and continuing lack of energy as a result of unexplained anemia . A low level of iron in the blood can he a sign of polyps or colon cancer . e Loss of weight for no apparent reason . " Ihe Keys to IPr , ention In addition to getting regular screenings , you can dramatically reduce your risk of developing colon cancer by making the following changes : Eat more fiber and less fat . Consuming a total of five servings ( one serving is equivalent to a half cup ) a day of vegetables , fruits , and whole grains , while limiting your intake of red meat and highfat foods , will reduce your chances of getting colon cancer by up to one third . Exercise regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerobics-for at least a half hour most days can cut your risk by about half . Exercise speeds digestion , leaving less time for cancer-causing toxins in food to accumulate in your colon . Ifyou smoke , quit . Limit alcohol-or avoid it . Consuming more than one or two drinks a day has been linked to colon cancer . Maintain a healthy weight . Having a body-mass index of 25 or higher ( to calculate yours , see page 92 ) raises your risk . Consider hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) if appropriate . Postmenopausal women who take HRT have a 35 percent lower risk of colon cancer . If you 're already using it to prevent osteoporosis or heart disease , the protection is an added benefit . But experts do n't recommend using it only for colon protection , because I IRT can increase breast-cancer risk . The Latest Treatments Medical advances are already helping many patients with colon cancer . If the illness is caught before it spreads beyond the colon ( known as Stage I ) , the odds of a cure are now better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the later stageswhen cancer breaks through the intestinal walls ( Stage 2 ) , invades the lymph nodes ( Stage 3 ) , and travels to other organs ( Stage 4 ) -a handful of treatments that either extend life or improve the ( quality of life are now being investigated . Here 's what 's new : Less radical surgery . Though many people worry that they 'll need a colostomy ( in which a portion of the colon is attached to the abdominal wall and body wastes must drain into a hag ) , it 's rarely necessary these days , says Dr. Guillem . " We can now preserve normal bowel function in ninety percent of people with rectal cancer , compared with only seventy-five to eighty percent ten years ago . " Doctors are starting to do laparoscopic surgery , in which tumors are removed through tiny incisions in the abdomen , reducing postoperative pain and speeding recovery . * Radiation that reduces the need for drastic surgery . Radiation may be used to shrink tumors before surgery , in some cases eliminating the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says LaSalle D. Leffall , Jr. , IM.D. , a professor of surgery at Howard UTniversity Hospital in Washington , DC . More effective chemotherapy . Used when a tumor has spread beyond the intestinal walls , chemotherapy now reduces the chance of recurrence by 30 to 40 percent-and the risk of death by 33 percent . The newer combinations of chemotherapies work better and can be given on an outpatient basis . " Smart bombs " that destroy only cancer cells . Drugs called monoclonal antibodies can spur the immune system to fend off colon cancer . They 're also being used to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells , sparing normal ones from toxic effects . Unfortunately , they do n't work for all patients . Shots that stimulate the immune system . Researchers at the University of Kentucky are conducting early tests of a vaccine designed to prevent colon cancer from recurring after surgery . So far , small studies have proved successful . More hope for a cure .
