<p> WASHINGTON - When Congress approved a test program for Medical Savings Accounts , conservative lawmakers and some in the insurance industry were confident this new way of paying for health care would become the latest rage among consumers . <p> But the program has not taken off as expected . Much of the public , employers and insurance salesmen are either ignorant or confused about how these tax-free accounts work . <p> " As they say in the business , you can produce the dog food but sometimes the dogs do n't eat it , " said Alan Gorlewski , the vice president of direct markets for Texas Blue Cross Blue Shield , which has experienced a disappointing reception to this latest variation of health coverage . <p> With Republicans pushing this year to expand Medical Savings Accounts , the question of their effectiveness is once again being debated in Congress . President Clinton has threatened to veto GOP-sponsored managed care bills that include provisions to make the tax-free accounts more widely available . <p> Congressional Democrats say the health accounts need more study and they point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . Republicans blame the Clinton administration for inserting onerous rules that have discouraged people from buying and selling the policies . <p> Medical Savings Accounts work like this : Consumers or employers purchase a catastrophic health insurance policy with deductibles that range from $ 1,500 to $ 4,500 . <p> The employer or consumer then can deposit a certain amount of money in a tax-free savings or money market account to be used for ordinary medical expenses . If the consumer does not use the accumulated funds in the account at the end of a given year , it is rolled over into the following year . Withdrawing the funds for reasons other than for medical expenses results in a stiff penalty . <p> Proponents argue that the arrangement would cut health care costs because consumers would be more judicious when spending money from their own accounts . <p> They maintained it would be attractive to employers who may not be able to afford comprehensive insurance policies for their workers but could defray the cost for a high-deductible policy that pays for major medical procedures <p> But opponents countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealthy , who do n't need conventional insurance . They have warned that the sicker and less fortunate will see their insurance premiums rise if healthier people leave the insurance pool . <p> After years of deadlock on the issue , Democrats and Republicans reached a compromise that was included in a 1996 health care bill that made health insurance portable and available to those with pre-existing conditions . <p> Under the compromise , a four-year test program for Medical Savings Accounts was set up to include only the self-employed or businesses with 50 or fewer employees . Limits were set on deductibles and how much employers or employees could contribute to the accounts . <p> Congress capped the number of policies that could be issued at 750,000 , a limit that many thought would soon be reached when the program commenced in January 1997 . But after the first six months , only about 22,000 policies had been issued , according to a report by the Internal Revenue Service . <p> Although the next official counting is not expected to be released until October , various groups have estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Proponents of Medical Savings Accounts say they are not surprised that sales have been so slow , claiming the administration constructed a test program designed to fail . <p> " The law is so restrictive it is in effect self-destructive , " said Larry Neal , a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas , a major proponent of the savings accounts . Neal said the conditions imposed on the sale of the accounts would be " like saying to Ford , ' Sure you can tool up and build a new pickup truck . But you can only sell it to 40 people and after six months you have to close up . ' " <p> To make the Medical Savings Accounts more attractive , Republicans have proposed lowering the deductibles and eliminating restrictions on how much employers and employees can contribute . The accounts also would be available to anyone and there would be no limit on policies sold . The Senate version also would allow people to withdraw money for nonmedical reasons , although consumers would have to forgo the tax break . <p> But opponents say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The reason why they are a flop is that consumers are averse to facing huge deductibles , " said Adrienne Michem , legislative counsel for Consumers Union . Michem said that many people are afraid they wo n't have enough money in their accounts to cover regular medical expenses . <p> Gorlewski at Blue Cross Blue Shield said initially he and others in the health insurance industry thought Medical Savings Accounts " were going to be the next greatest hot product in the marketplace . " <p> But he said insurance brokers have complained that the accounts are too complicated to explain to customers over the telephone and not profitable to sell since high-deductible policies bring smaller commissions than comprehensive plans . <p> Gorlewski said that in Texas the market for these policies are primarily people who previously had been self-insured , many of them ranchers , farmers , accountants and real estate agents . He said the average purchaser was married , mid-40s in age and with income of about $ 60,000 . He said younger people could not afford to put money away in a savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest in purchasing group policies for their workers , believing it is too cumbersome to administer . <p> Officials at the Golden Rule Insurance Company , which pioneered the Medical Savings Account concept and has pushed it in Congress , say they are not having trouble selling the product . The Illinois-based company has sold 31,522 policies since 1997 , about 30 percent of their new business , said spokeswoman Amanda Newlon . <p> " Whereas we were ready to go , other companies may still be figuring out how to market this product , " said Newlon . <p> Newlon said the average buyer of her company 's Medical Savings Accounts is 44 years old , married with children and with an income under $ 25,000 . <p> She said about 17 percent of the purchases were from people who previously were uninsured . <p> Lawmakers may never get a completely accurate gauge of who is buying the products . Phyllis Thornburn , an official with the General Accounting Office , which was assigned to study the accounts , said her agency can not do a good study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last year the GAO surveyed insurance companies about the program and concluded that they were having trouble marketing the accounts . The report attributed the sluggish sales to the complexity of the plans and insurance brokers ' reluctance to push them . <p> The findings are similar to those of another study by the National Center for Policy Analysis , a Dallas-based conservative think tank that initially pushed the concept . The center 's study recommended that Congress drop the current restrictions on the savings accounts . <p> Even if changes are made in the program , Merrill Matthews Jr. , the Dallas group 's vice president for domestic policy , acknowledged that it may take time for the public to warm up to the new approach to paying for health care . <p> " I think we anticipated greater excitement and we were unrealistic in that anticipation , " he said .
