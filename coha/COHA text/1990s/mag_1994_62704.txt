No matter how fast Gwen Torrence 's legs move , the fastest thing about her may be her mouth , which on occasion has run too fast for her own good . " Gwen 's a very honest person , " says Brad Hunt , her agent . " It 's unfortunate that her comments sometimes draw more attention than her athletic ability . " // Indeed , though Torrence may be the most versatile sprinter in the world  --  world class at every distance from 60 to 400 meters  --  she has never attracted as much attention as she did when , after finishing fourth in the 100 at the 1992 Olympics , she insinuated that three others in the race had been using performance-enhancing drugs . Naming no names and offering no proof , Torrence found herself in a maelstrom of controversy with her best event , the 200 , still to come . " She 'd say it over again , but at a different time , " says Hunt . " It was a tribute to her focus that with reporters from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best time . " Although Torrence came across in Barcelona as the classic sore loser , it helps to remember the context of her post-100 remarks . At the 1991 world championships she finished second in both the 100 and the 200 to Katrin Krabbe of Germany , who later tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug clenbuterol. // Last weekend in Atlanta , at the USA/ Mobil Indoor Track and Field Championships , Torrence again found herself at the center of a small tempest . On the track she was sensational , winning both the 60 and 200 , twice breaking her own American record in the latter . On Saturday afternoon she blew away the field to win the 60 in 7.10 seconds . An hour later she shaved .10 off her day-old record in the 200 , running 22.74. // Torrence was named female Athlete of the Meet , which delighted the Georgia Dome crowd of 19,080 . After each win she jogged around the track , resplendent in the pink bodysuit that has earned her the nickname Pink Panther , tossed her victor 's bouquet into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shrieking children . It was a scene that almost did n't take place . Although she lives with her husband , Manley Waller , and four-year-old son in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur , where she grew up , and although much of her family had not seen her run since high school , Torrence had decided to compete only three days earlier . " So many people told me they had bought tickets to watch me run , it changed my mind , " she says . Her reluctance to enter the meet was attributable in part to a chronically sore right hamstring , which she aggravated at the Millrose Games in early February . But Hunt says Torrence was also miffed because USA Track &amp; Field did n't enlist her help in promoting the meet . Ollan Cassell , the organization 's executive director , says it would have been unfair to promote the meet with an athlete who might not compete in it , but Hunt insists that Cassell 's people knew of her interest long before the Millrose Games . // Torrence is only 28 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 , when the Games will be held in her hometown . This summer she plans to explore the 400 , in which she has been clocked at 49.83 , third fastest in the world last year . " I 'm just testing the waters to see what I might run in ' 96 , " she says . Her rivals stand warned . Those waters could get mighty hot .
