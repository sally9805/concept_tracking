Agnes Patricia Riley Horvath , whose daughter , Teresa , would become Tessa Kent , lay in bed at three in the morning . She had been awakened , as usual , by obsessive , angry thoughts about her husband , Sandor , and the way in which he dominated the upbringing of their only child , who now , in August 1967 , had reached the age of twelve . Her parents had opposed her marriage to Sandor Horvath in 1954 and they had been right , Agnes told herself . She was humiliated to the marrow of her bones as she relived her folly , lying next to Sandor in those private hours during which she was unable to keep her mind under control . If it were n't for Sandor 's stern prohibitions , Agnes reflected furiously , Teresa would be well launched on her career , a career about which there was n't the smallest question --  destiny Agnes knew to be as fixed as the rotation of the earth . Her daughter had been born a star -- yes a star !  - -  by virtue of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as a small child . That was n't a mere mother 's pride talking , that was the opinion of everyone who 'd ever seen her , Agnes told herself , trembling with frustration . Teresa should be making movies , or at the very least commercials -- there was no limit to her future . But no , her husband , unable to move away from his rigid , old-fashioned , European ideas of what was correct and proper for a young girl , had steadily refused to let her take the girl to New York , where she could meet the influential people who would recognize how exceptional her daughter was . Night after night , Agnes Horvath asked herself what had possessed her , when she was a mere eighteen and far too stupid to make choices , to insist on marrying a man who was essentially foreign to the tight-knit , devout , Irish Catholic world in which she had her enviable place as the youngest of the five sparkling , black-haired , blue-eyed Riley daughters . Why had she set her heart on a refugee from Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes asked herself this question , she could n't stop herself from treating it as if it were a newly discovered problem that might contain some newly meaningful answer . She 'd recapitulate the past as seriously as if she might still uncover some forgotten fact that would suddenly change the present . Sandor had been an amazingly handsome man , a charming and romantic stranger , who had swept the provincial fool she had been off her feet and out of what small , unsophisticated wits she had possessed . The distinguished man who spoke English with more elegance and precision than any American boy had been irresistible to her barely formed mind and impressionable heart . Savagely Agnes reminded herself that she 'd also been suffering from a bad case of seeing Gone with the Wind too many times . Then , and still today , at forty-eight , Sandor strongly resembled Leslie Howard , but she 'd been too immature to realize how quickly his fine-boned , intellectual , sensitive beauty would become infuriating when she weighed them against the rules and regulations he imposed on her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and Agnes Horvath had known for at least half of it that she 'd made the biggest mistake a deeply religious Catholic woman could make . No matter how great her rage against her husband , there could be no thought of divorce . But even if the mere idea of divorce had not been a sin , what training did she have to make a living for herself and Teresa if they were to find themselves on their own ? Agnes Riley had been brought up to be a protected wife and a devoted mother , nothing more , and certainly nothing less , like every other woman of her generation . Sandor earned a good salary as the head of the music department at an exclusive girls school in Stamford , Connecticut , not far from their home on the modest edge of the rich community of Greenwich , where they lived in order to be near their daughter 's school . Teresa was a day student at the Convent of the Sacred Heart , an aristocratic institution which they were both intent on her attending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , she had to admit that Sandor worked hard to make his way in his new country . Her sisters had married local boys in nearby Bridgeport , where she 'd grown up , mates whose status never came close to that of a professor . Some of these good Irish-American boys made considerably more money than Sandor in their blue-collar jobs , but the whole family respected her elegant , learned husband . Each of Agnes 's sisters had produced a sprawling brood of kids , ordinary , unremarkable , almost indistinguishable kids . When she took Teresa to their frequent family gatherings there was no doubt about whose child , among the dozens of cousins , was the center of attention . Teresa 's singularity was a subject of family pride rather than any sniping or competition . From the time she was a tiny baby she had so fine and rare a quality that a party would have been incomplete without Teresa to marvel at . Her own sisters , Agnes knew , were in awe of the child she 'd brought into their limited world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones whisking her away so they could play with her as if she were some very precious kind of doll . Teresa was the only one of the cousins who did n't attend a local parochial school . At the Convent , one of the many Sacred Heart schools in the world , she was a " Day Hop , " not a boarding student . Many daughters of millionaires were her classmates , a distinction that only added to Teresa 's exhalted position in the Riley family . " Your family will ruin her utterly with all that attention , " Sandor had grumbled angrily after the last Riley get-together . " Teresa 's becoming spoiled . She used to be such a satisfactory child , docile and obedient , but lately , I warn you , Agnes , I sense that there 's something going on inside her that I worry about ... some sort of rebellion under the surface , something I ca n't put my finger on . And I most definitely do n't approve of that ' best friend ' of hers , that Mimi Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , she 's not even a Catholic , heaven knows what ideas she 's putting --  " " You 're imagining things , " Agnes had snapped . " Every little girl has a best friend , and the Petersons are lovely , suitable people . They may be Protestants but they have the good sense to realize that the quality of education at Sacred Heart is better than that at an ordinary school . And they truly appreciate Teresa , which is more than her own father seems to do . " " How can you say something so unfair ? " he demanded , stung . " I love her too much for my own good , but , Agnes , the world 's a difficult place and Teresa 's not a princess , whatever you may think . She does n't need any more fuss made about her than she already gets from you . The way you dote on her is shameless ... it comes close to the sin of pride , if you ask me . " " Sandor ! " " Pride , Agnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you imagine I do n't know that ? " she asked , outraged . She loathed his tone when he started to talk church doctrine , as sanctimonious , stuffy and hair splitting as if he 'd lived hundreds of years ago . " Too high an opinion of one 's offspring , can , like pride , lead to the sin of presumption . " " When I need a priest 's interpretation of sin , Sandor , I know where to go for it . How dare you preach to me ? " " Agnes , but you realize that in less than a year Teresa will be a teenager ? I 've seen your sisters go through enough trouble with their own teenaged children , why should we be different ? If only ... " " If only we 'd had more children ? Do n't you dare , Sandor ! I wanted them as much as you did . Are you saying it was my fault that I had those miscarriages ... ? " " Agnes , you ca n't possibly be starting this nonsense again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that if only it were ten years ago life would be simpler , if only there were standards ... if only people stayed the same ! In my country teenagers behaved like the school children they are . Please stop talking about fault . The Blessed Virgin did n't mean it to be , and we must accept that . " But he did blame her , Agnes Horvath brooded angrily , he blamed her in his heart of hearts , but never as much as she blamed herself , no matter how ridiculous and futile and morally wrong she knew it was to use the word " blame " about a situation that was in the hands of God alone . But at least she had Teresa , and was n't one Teresa worth a houseful of ordinary children ?
