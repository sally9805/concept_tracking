NOW IT can be told : The storybook marriage of the century is almost certain to end in divorce this year . So says the pack of seasoned pundits and royal watchers whose blow-by-blow accounts of the woes of Diana , Princess of Wales , and her estranged husband Prince Charles have turned into one of the great soap operas of our time . No doubt both the reserved 46-year-old heir to the British throne and his formerly giggly 33-year-old wife will be relieved to put asunder their unlucky 13-year union . But sadly for Diana , mother of heir Wills , 12 ; and spare Harry , 10 , shedding matrimonial shackles also means losing a host of princely perks . She 'll have to say ta-ta to the lavish 412-foot royal yacht Britannia with its crew of 240 , the 14-car royal train and the Queen 's Flight of three British Aerospace jets and two helicopters that cost British taxpayers about $48 million a year . Toodles as well to her spacious suite in Kensington Palace , the royals ' sprawling red-brick compound at the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartfelt adieu to Highgrove , the Prince of Wales ' neoclassical official residence complete with elaborate gardens , swimming pool and six-horse stables on a 1,100-acre estate in Gloucestershire , 100 miles west of London ( current value : about $4.8 million ) . Not to mention Diana 's chance to be Queen of England . Never mind all that , Di . We need to talk , heart to heart , about your post-Charles future . Like many a sheltered wife facing divorce , you need to brace yourself for the coming challenges , including disentangling your identity from your husband 's , finding fulfilling employment and learning  --  finally  --  how to supervise your finances . To secure a fair divorce settlement , you also need some frank advice , especially because British divorce law tends to favor wealthy husbands over dependent wives . Specifically , MONEY 's royal-divorce experts , consulted by this writer during a five-day visit to London last fall , say you should : * Wait for Charles to take the first step toward divorce proceedings ; * Hold out for a lump sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last resort ; * Stand firm against unreasonable demands , such as the return of jewelry you 've been given ; and , in what may be your stiffest challenge considering your indulgent spending habits , * Take personal control of the money you 're sure to receive . Sugar Daddies Although it 's almost inconceivable that Diana , whose personal worth is estimated in the $9 million range , will ever want for money , stranger things have happened  --  like her marriage , for instance . So she , like many wealthy divorcing women on both sides of the Atlantic , must overcome a potentially crippling naivete about matters monetary . " I see so many women going through divorces who are completely in the dark about their finances , " says Victoria Collins , an Irvine , Calif. financial planner and co-author of Divorce and Money ( Nolo , $21.95 ) . Alas , our princess appears to be one of them . She has been supported by men for most of her life . Before marrying in July 1981 , she lived in a $150,000 , three-bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich father , Earl Spencer . Lacking a college degree , she earned only about $4 an hour as a teaching assistant at the Young England kindergarten . Since her wedding at the age of 20 , she has depended on her husband , whose 1993 pretax income topped $6.5 million . Even today , after two years of official separation , Diana lives rent-free at Kensington Palace while Charles , whose in-town residence is two miles away at St. James 's Palace ; picks up virtually all of her expenses . In fact , until recently Diana probably had n't touched money in years . " The royals never carry it , " explains Ross Benson , a columnist for London 's Daily Express . On most shopping jaunts , for example , an aide followed along to settle bills . Primping princess And those bills can be whoppers . First , there 's couture fashion from designers such as Chanel , Tomasz Starzewski and Catherine Walker . In the first 10 years of marriage , Andrew Morton , author of Diana : Her New Life , estimates that Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that many designers gave her generous discounts . In May 1994 , a friend of Charles ' told the London tabloids that Di was spending $4,800 a week on " grooming , " such as hairstyling , manicures and pedicures . A large chunk of that money doubtless goes toward a round of New Age therapies that Diana has been indulging in " frenetically " since her separation , says Morton  --  from massage and hypnotism to acupuncture , aromatherapy and colonic irrigation ( a bowel-cleansing treatment ) . Then there 's her three-mornings-a-week workout at the Harbour Club , a high-security complex near the Thames with dozens of spanking-new Universal weight machines , a 25-meter navy-blue pool and a chic restaurant ( initiation fee : $3,840 , plus $1,728 a year ) , and her membership at the discreet Vanderbilt Racquet Club ( initiation fee : $1,520 , plus $1,272 a year and court fees of up to $35 an hour ) . To her credit , Diana has been down-playing her spendthrift image since the 1992 separation . When she traveled to the Caribbean last January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airways flight instead of hopping aboard a royal plane . She also turned in a loaner $120,000 red Mercedes for a more modest Audi convertible that she drives herself . And last year , she even dismissed the taxpayer-paid detective assigned to guard her ( though he 's lately back on the job ) . Indeed , Di does n't lack for good help . Despite announcing her withdrawal from public life in December 1993 , the princess is still served by a private secretary , a personal assistant , a press officer and a few additional secretaries . Salaries for that staff , as well as for her chef , butler , maids and other household help , are all paid by her estranged husband . Dough , boy ! Where does the big-eared one get the cash ? Look no further than a nifty royal perk called the Duchy of Cornwall ( see the box on page 107 ) , a hereditary estate that handed Charles a handsome $6.5 million in 1993 , the first year in which he agreed to pay income tax , estimated at $1.6 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Prince of Wales , author Jonathan Dimbleby claims that the prince 's personal assets total a comparatively modest $3.2 million . But there 's more , according to biographer Anthony Holden . He reports that Queen Elizabeth set up an $8 million trust fund for each of her children at their birth . Assuming that money grew at a reasonable 10% a year , Charles ' fund figures to approach $640 million today . And let 's not forget the prince 's prospective inheritance from the 68-year-old Queen , the monarch-matriarch whom Fortune magazine ranked as the richest woman in the world in 1993 . Her estimated net worth : $7.8 billion . Approximately $7 billion is in hereditary Crown possessions such as art , jewelry and palaces ; the remaining $800 million or so constitute her personal assets , including an investment portfolio that money-and-monarchy expert Phillip Hall estimates at $650 million . Even though Elizabeth , like her son , agreed to begin paying income taxes in 1993 , she will continue to be exempt from inheritance taxes on all personal assets she bequeaths to the next sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascend the throne ) . That windfall tax advantage will doubtless induce her to leave most of her personal wealth to Charles rather than to other family members . Missing out on such riches will by no means reduce the princess to Cinderella , of course : She 's a wealthy woman in her own right . When her father died in 1991 , the bulk of his $141 million estate , largely museum-quality art , went to Diana 's 30-year-old brother Charles . But Michael Nash , a senior law lecturer at Norwich City College who is at work on a book about royal divorce , says it 's reasonable to assume that Diana and her two sisters got a portion too . Our estimate for Di 's share : $4 million . The princess also has jewels  --  $5 million worth , by some estimates . Her biggest scores came as wedding gifts ( see the box opposite ) and as not-so-petite bijoux from representatives of Middle Eastern countries . ( Box omitted ) Taken , together , her jewelry and inheritance may well amount to a tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a seven-figure asset base ca n't always buy love . On a British television documentary last June , Charles admitted committing adultery , most likely with his long-time flame Camilla Parker Bowles . A few months later , former British army officer James Hewitt , 36 , alleged in the Anna Pasternak book Princess in Love that he and Diana were lovers from 1986 through 1991 . And adding insult to all this supposed mutual injury , the Dimbleby account stated that Charles never loved Diana : His father Prince Philip bullied him into marrying the young woman . To deal with such pressures , Morton says the princess has begun seeing a psychotherapist twice a week ( typical cost in London : $60 per 50-minute session ) and taking the trendy mood-enhancing drug Prozac ( cost for the typical patient under Britain 's socialized medical plan : $7.60 per month ) . Humpty-Dumpty Can the royals find a way to put this marriage back together again ? Doubtful . We 'll let the tabloids slug that one out . Meantime , we 'll focus on helpful advice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds for divorce in England are " irretrievable breakdown " of the marriage . British law says two years ' separation is evidence of such a failure , and that two-year marker passed for the Wales pair last Dec. 9 . Once legal papers requesting divorce are filed with the divorce registry in London , a divorce can be finalized within a month or so . Diana 's lawyer Lord Mishcon told MONEY he has not yet discussed a divorce or a financial settlement with Charles ' lawyer , Henry Boyd-Carpenter , and Boyd-Carpenter 's office concurs . But not everyone believes that . " Sources tell me that exploratory talks have gone quite a way forward , " reports Nash . What is clear is that Diana will need to fight hard for a substantial settlement . That 's because in Britain , the court 's decision about the size of the award to the less wealthy spouse is traditionally based on the concept of that individual 's " reasonable needs . " ( For a snapshot on U.S. law , see the box opposite . ) ( Box omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tooth in London : " If the court decides that a wife 's reasonable needs are for L100,000 a year , whether the husband has L50 million or L500 million does n't matter . " To figure out precisely what those reasonable needs are , the court is supposed to consider the couple 's standard of living before the marriage broke down . Yet in practice , says Tooth , even wives of British megamillionaires rarely win lump-sum awards worth more than L5 million ( $8 million ) . Lovelorn Even so , savvy royal watchers say Diana is less worried about negotiating a big financial settlement than she is in winning unlimited contact with sensitive William and outgoing Harry , both of whom attend boarding school at Ludgrove in Berkshire , where annual tuition , room and board costs $14,000 per child . The kids currently split their holiday time equally between her and Charles . " It 's her greatest concern that her children will be taken away from her , " says Morton . Diana has personal reasons for that fear : Her divorcing mother lost custody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just seven years old because the courts frowned on the fact that her mother had left Earl Spencer for another man . And despite wagging tongues that have variously linked Diana to everyone from London antique dealer Oliver Hoare to New York City financier Teddy Forstmann , that 's a mistake this lovelorn princess is unlikely to make . Wait for Charles to initiate divorce proceedings . As British Prime Minister John Major pointed out in 1992 , should the queen die while Charles and Diana are still legally married , Diana may claim the throne as queen . Further , if Charles is king when the divorce takes place , he will have far greater wealth at his disposal than he does now , which may boost Di 's chances for a sizable financial settlement . Charles ' fear of such scenarios  --  which she might do well to hint at  --  gives her negotiating power . Do n't panic about the kids . In Britain , the courts get involved in custody decisions only if parents ca n't agree on a suitable arrangement . But legally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heirs presumptive . So technically , the queen could override Diana 's parental rights and specify how and where Princes William and Harry live . But obviously , to avoid widespread public censure , the queen is unlikely to exercise that power . As a practical matter , so long as Diana does n't move to another country , the couple will probably continue to share custody . ' ' Stand firm against unreasonable demands . Charles will likely seek significant concessions from Diana in return for generous financial support . The most predictable demand : She agrees not to do anything that might embarrass the royal family in the future , such as publish her memoirs . Nash even foresees financial penalties if she marries again before her kids are both 18 , lest her future husband be deemed unfit by the Crown . By then Diana would be 41  --  leaving her little time to produce the two daughters she 's said to want . Diana 's bargaining chip is her power to create bad publicity for the royals . Hang on to the jewels . Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heirlooms and should be returned  --  or that the jewels she was given by foreign heads of state are state property . Not necessarily . " Even if Diana got those gifts on an official state visit , it 's possible for her to argue that they 're her private property , " says Phillip Hall ! , author of the ground-breaking 1992 book Royal Fortune . A compelling reason to keep the jewelry : Diana can sell the gems if she ever gets into a financial jam . Hold out for a large lump sum . A clean-break settlement of $20 million or so rather than maintenance payments of about $800,000 a year , says divorce solicitor Raymond Tooth , will make Diana far more independent . Another reason to prefer the money up front : In Britain , as in the United States , alimony ceases upon the death of the payer or recipient , or the recipient 's remarriage . To net the largest possible settlement , Diana should argue that she must maintain a standard of living appropriate to the mother of the heir to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charles ' money is tied up in trusts , the queen would likely have to contribute to make a sizable clean-break settlement possible . Hire and manage the right financial advisers . Clearly , Diana will never have to trouble herself doping out a P/E ratio . But she must take charge of her finances and her money managers . " You ca n't delegate everything , " says financial planner Jon Golding , chairman of London 's Sterling Westminster Group . Flying solo , Diana needs to put herself on a budget and ensure that the investments from her anticipated lump sum will provide adequate income for the rest of her life  --  easily 50 or 60 more years . Golding advises her to keep about 18% of her investments in cash for easy access ; 25% in bonds for income ; 43% in stocks and stock funds for growth ; 4% in precious metals as an inflation hedge ; and the remaining 10% in a so-called enterprise investment trust , a British contrivance that would allow her to shelter the resulting income from taxes . Because Diana would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which kicks in at an annual taxable income of L23,700 ( $37,920 ) , she should take advantage of as many other tax-advantaged investments as possible . Look to the future . Choosing some kind of work would give the divorced Diana a renewed sense of purpose , points out Linda Barbanel , a New York City psychotherapist . A good start : Diana 's new role this year leading the British Red Cross ' 125th anniversary fund drive . Other options : the lecture circuit ; product endorsements ( if sports celebrity Michael Jordan can snag an $18 million contract to push Gatorade , think how much Diana could command by flogging , say , Evian water ) ; even a spot of writing ( sister-in-law Fergie pulled down a reported $3 million for her children 's books ) . Independent income , and the self-respect it brings , could come in handy in the event the ex-princess starts a new family . Now that would be a happy ending . <p>                  @ @ @
