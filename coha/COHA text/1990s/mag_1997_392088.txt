Dr. Kenneth V. Hardy says that it should n't be compulsory for a woman to take her husband 's name . He believes that a woman should be allowed to make a decision . // A woman in England recently won the ight to give her illegitimate child her surname despite the objections of the child 's father . Dawn Wearmouth registered her 16month-old son as Alexander Wearmouth . The child 's father , Mark Dawson , with whom Wearmouth dated but never wed , wanted his son to have his last name and not the name of a man to whom he was not related . Wearmouth , who kept the name of her ex-husband , argued that it would be better for young Alexander to have the same name as her other children . Subsequently . the Court ot Appeal ruled that the choice of Wearmouth 's own name was " logical and natural and can not be justly criticized as alien merely because it is also the name of her ex-husband . " This ruling has made some begin to examine the notion of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact it makes upon a woman 's life . JET spoke with noted experts to determine , Should married women take their husbands ' name ? Traditionally , throughout the years , it has become a common practice for women to take the name of their husbands . Dr. Kenneth V. Hardy , a family therapist and professor of family therapy at Syracuse University in New York , believes it should not be compulsory that a woman use her husband 's name . He says a woman should be allowed the freedom to decide . " Names say a lot about who we are . They are very symbolic of who we are , " begins Dr. Hardy . " Women should be allowed to voluntarily decide if they want to change their last name . When men marry , they hold on and keep their identity , but it almost requires that women give up who they are . I think that it is for each couple and each woman to work out and negotiate if she wants to change her last name . " Dr. Hardy , author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their maiden name are often viewed as " women 's libbers anti-marriage or too individualistically oriented . " " People should n't make these negative attributions and criticisms , asserts Dr. Hardy , " because a woman wants to hold on to her name . Marriage is a partnership , and women should n't have to suppress or relinquish their identity . It should n't be culminated or seen as a threat by men if a woman chooses to do this . If a couple can talk about this issue , it holds promise that they 'll be able to negotiate other , more important issues . " Photograph Dr. Audrey Chapman believes that a couple should decide what 's best for them . She says there may be several reasons why a woman would want to keep her name or use her husband 's name . Photograph Bishop Thomas T.D . " Jakes , Sr. says the Bible suggests that a woman follow her husband , which would include taking his name , but in today 's society the issue has become more flexible . // Dr. Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that couples should discuss the issue of whether the woman should take her husband 's name . " I do n't lean on either side . It 's a loaded , convoluted situation , " responds Dr. Chapman , author of Getting Good Loving : How Black Men And Women Can Make Love Work . " It 's not as simple as should she or should n't she take her husband 's name . There may be several reasons for her to keep her name or for her to change it . I think it 's got to be something that the couple talks about . Couples should do premarital therapy . " Continues Dr. Chapman , " In a woman changing her name , the couple has to look at what that says to her partner and what that says about her . Sometimes it 's about being a control freak ' or a selfish person . Sometimes there 's a strong connection with their extended family . Sometimes it 's a tradition that women keep or give up their name . " Bishop Thomas " T.D . " Jakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Loosed ! and Daddy Loves His Girls , says that the Bible teaches that women should take their husbands ' name . " Scriptures mandate this , " informs Bishop Jakes , founder and senior pastor of the Pentecostal church The Potter 's House in Dallas , TX . " When the Bible deals with marriage , it deals with the male as the aggressor , and it says he takes unto him a wife . ' In Ephesians 5:22-24 it discusses that wives should submit to their husbands . It is God 's will , according to scripture , that man not only be successful but be prepared to share that success with the woman of his choice . " Bishop Jakes cites that although the Bible eludes to the woman following her husband , which would include taking his name , says the evangelist , we 're living in a new age and era in which people do n't always adhere to this belief . " Some women think that they lose their identity by taking their husbands ' name , but that seems futile because she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man 's name to another . But her name does n't give her identity ; it 's who she is and what she does that determines her destiny . " For celebrities , it is n't unusual for women to keep their surname , especially when it has become synonymous with a successful career . A few female celebrities have opted to hold on to their surnames while also using their husbands ' name , such as Kim Fields Freeman and Holly Robinson Peete . And in some instances , female stars have chosen to take their husbands ' name , such as Phylicia Rashad .

" I did n't want to mix up the record buyers by changing the name , " says Angie , whose married name is Caldwell . Debbie 's married name is Lowe . // " Names have contractual power for stars , singers and authors , " says Bishop Jakes . " The name becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forfeit that name would cause her not to be recognized and could undermine her career . For many in this situation , it 's a business and marketing decision . ' Singers Angie and Debbie Winans of the renowned Winans gospel family have chosen to keep their distinguished maiden names for that reason . " I used my maiden name before I got married into the industry , " says Angie , who 's been married to Cedric Caldwell for five years . " I did n't want to mix up the record buyers by changing the name . But I do use my married name for everything else , except in the industry . " Adds Angie Winans , whose next album with sister Debbie will be titled Bold , " When you get married , the man 's name is supposed to go on . That 's the way God designed it . We are supposed to carry his name . The Bible says when you marry you become one . You become one , and it 's not about changing your identity ; love overlooks all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for the industry . I believe that if you and your husband are in agreement , it will be okay . " <p>
