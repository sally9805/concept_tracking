WITH A BAN ON ASBESTOS IMMINENT IN THE UNITED STATES , THE MARKETERS OF CANADA 'S DEADLY FIBER LOOK FARTHER AFIELD . <p> Canada is hooked on white powder . Not cocaine or heroin , but asbestos  --  that undeniably useful fibrous mineral that insulates houses and ships , strengthens cement and textiles , and kills those who breathe its chalky dust . <p> As the world 's largest exporter of asbestos , Canada depends on willing foreign markets . For years its most eager customer was the United States  --  at least until dying U. S. workers started suing asbestos manufacturers by the thousands . In 1986 the Environmental Protection Agency announced a total ban on asbestos , to take effect by 1996 , further weakening the already deteriorating Canadian industry . " Given the rate at which asbestos use in the United States has been declining , " says environmental consultant Barry Castleman , " the EPA ' ban ' may come to little more than closing the coffin after the industry has died from other causes . " <p> Canadian asbestos production , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and Europe diminished , Canada found a new market in the developing world  --  and the coffin lid creaked open again . <p> Asbestos is often put to use in the Third World in ways not envisioned in the glossy brochures put out by the Asbestos Institute , the largely government funded marketing and promotional arm of the Canadian asbestos industry . In Ipoh , Malaysia , for instance , thousands of people have settled next to the dump used by the United Asbestos Cement factory , where they scavenge material to build their homes : broken asbestos-cement pipe for drains , asbestos sheeting for walls and roofs , and asbestos felt for carpets . United Asbestos officials told the local newspaper , the Utusan Konsumer , that there was no problem because they use only " the safest type of asbestos "  --  white , chrysotile fiber imported from Canada . " Malaysia is one of the countries targeted by the Canadian asbestos industry as a huge potential market , " the paper notes . <p> The Asbest End factory in Kartal , Turkey , makes automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , and paper surgical masks , which they are told to reuse for a few days , " relates Middle East Report magazine . " None of these are sufficient to protect against the asbestos dust swirling in the air as men manually shovel it from bin to bin , take it out of bags and break it down to dust , and shave the brake pads into proper size . " Because of the oppressive heat , most of the workers do n't even bother to wear the masks . " The people in this country are uneducated and they deliver themselves to God , " says the plant 's owner . " What am I supposed to do ? I am not their parents . " <p> If conditions in Turkey are somewhat crude , Thailand is considered by the Asbestos Institute to be a model for the safe and modem " controlled use " of asbestos . " They can certainly enforce regulations , " boasted institute president Claude Forget in 1988 . " Some of their industry operates according to the best world standards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asbestos factory , Thailand 's second largest . But when the Canadian 95th estate investigative television team visited Olympic in 1988 , they found that the plant had no ventilation system , and indeed , according to the show 's transcript , " nothing to prevent the invisible fibers and the asbestos dust from covering the workers , collecting on the floor , and forming a crust on the nearby control panels . " Outside the plant , 95th estate filmed " another situation you would n't find in North America : the children of workers roaming the company compound among the discarded equipment , the empty bags , and the mounds of waste asbestos . " <p> The dangers of asbestos , the documentary team concluded , are virtually unknown in Thailand . For example , while smoking is widely understood to result in a 55-fold increase in the chance of contracting asbestos-related cancer , it is still common among Thai asbestos workers . This ignorance is not wholly the fault of the Thai authorities ; when they sought to mandate a skull-andcrossbones label on sacks of the mineral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Asbestos is , after cigarettes , one of the leading causes of cancer among industrial workers . In the United States alone , 8,000 to 12,000 people die of asbestos-related diseases each year . Since many other asbestos-using countries do not officially recognize diseases caused by asbestos ( and are not equipped to diagnose them if they did ) , the worldwide death count is unknown . <p> Throughout its history , the asbestos industry has consistently denied or downplayed the dangers of its product . When the Asbestos Institute needed public-relations help in Washington , it engaged the services of Hill and Knowlton , the same firm to which the tobacco industry turned in the early 1970s to argue the safety of cigarettes . In the 1930s and ' 40s , officials of the Johns-Manville Corporation deliberately withheld information about the dangers of asbestos from their workers . ( " Do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead ? " an asbestos-insulation manufacturer asked Johns Manville executive Vandiver Brown in 1942 , after discovering that his employees were developing asbestosis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money that way . " ) Up until 1975 , company doctors at the Thetford Mine in Quebec regularly told workers suffering from asbestosis that they were in good health , even when they were about to die . In 1978 the Asbestos International Association advised its member countries to adopt the bland " take care with asbestos " notice used in Great Britain , if use of a label was unavoidable . " Rediscussing the wording , " the industry group warned , " could bring along the risk of having to include the word cancer . ' " <p> That asbestos was not banned years ago is likely due to the fact that its diseases take so very long to develop . Asbestosis , a lung ailment in which scars caused by inhaled fibers slowly choke off breath , can take 10 or 12 years to appear , and many more to kill , even under the dustiest conditions . ( Asbestosis sufferers often develop fat , clubbed fingers , a sign of severe oxygen deficiency . ) An affliction usually associated with massive , prolonged exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ; today it is increasingly becoming a Third World disease . <p> While it is firmly established that asbestos has a " dose response " relationship to cancer  --  i.e. , the greater the dose , the higher the risk  --  there is considerable debate as to whether there is a " threshold " level below which asbestos fibers are safe to inhale . Even quite brief exposure to asbestos can result in lung cancer or the extremely painful tumor of the lung cavity called mesothelioma . " If they ever give you your choice of what you want to die from , " advises attorney Steve Kazan , who has represented scores of asbestos victims , " pick something else . " <p> The most ruinous days for American workers came during and immediately after World War II , when widespread and rarely controlled shipyard use of asbestos exposed thousands to lethal doses . In the postwar building boom , asbestos sheeting and spray-on acoustic ceilings ( the ones that look like cottage cheese ) became standard in many schools , homes , and public buildings . Victims from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick they could n't see . " Here comes daddy the snowman ! " children would call as their fathers came home , covered in asbestos dust . Many such children later fell ill themselves , as did the women who washed the workclothes . Even family dogs died of mesothelioma . <p> Because of the long latency period for asbestos cancers ( lung cancers and mesotheliomas often do not develop until 20 , 30 , even 40 years after exposure ) , victims did not start dying in large numbers until the 1950s and ' 60s . ( Washington state , whose wartime shipyards offered a relatively high level of asbestos protection , now suffers the highest mesothelioma rate in the nation , workers at dirtier shipyards in other parts of the country having already died of asbestosis . ) <p> In 1964 , Irving Selikoff of the Mt . Sinai Medical Center presented irrefutable documentation of the deadly nature of asbestos ; only then did warning labels begin to appear on asbestos products . ( Sacks of Canadian asbestos , however , remained unlabeled until 1969 . ) Selikoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the United States . The first steps were taken by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , whose eight-hour inhalation limits have declined from 12 fibers per cubic centimeter in 1971 to 0.2 today . ( A standard of 0.1 is now being considered . ) The OSHA regulations were repeatedly challenged in court by the Asbestos Institute , which claimed they were neither necessary nor technologically feasible . <p> " Why is Canada so grimly determined to prevent the United States from protecting the health of its citizens ? " asks Ray Sentes , a political scientist at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan . A former insulation installer who suffers from asbestosis , Sentes has become one of Canada 's leading critics on the issue . His country 's concern about U. S. regulation , he says , is " based partly upon the fear that the safer standard would be adopted in those Third World countries which look to the United States as a model . " <p> The Canadians lost their suit over the OSHA standards , but carried the fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger question of whether asbestos ought to be allowed at all . The Canadian asbestos industry mounted a frantic $2.5-million lobbying campaign . An internal EPA memo of 1984 explains the sensitivity of the issue : " The Canadians have indicated to us confidentially that in terms of the Canadian domestic political situation , it is important the Canadian federal government appear it is doing all that it can to protect the domestic industry . It is equally important to the Canadians that this not be interpreted as opposition to a health-related regulation for solely economic and trade considerations . " <p> Canada attempted to head off EPA action by meeting secretly with the Office of Management and Budget , newly empowered by Ronald Reagan to review federal regulations . In 1985 the asbestos industry 's wish came true when the OMB wrested rule-making authority from the EPA . In the uproar that followed , a congressional committee found that the OMB had " engaged in secret communications with outside parties , leaving other interested parties on the sidelines watching a different game . " The EPA regained control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stalled until 1989 . <p> That ban was , of course , challenged by the Canadians ; the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the matter by the end of the year . Asbestos Institute president Gratton confidently foresees " the rule either being repealed or at least remanded back to the EPA for major modifications . " Experience has made optimists of the Canadians . " It 's never over until it 's over , " explained Canadian Ambassador to the United States Allan Gotlieb upon leaving Washington in 1988 , " and in the U. S. system of government , it 's never over . " <p> Asbestos mining in Canada provides scarcely 2,000 jobs , and accounts for only one percent of total mineral exports . Substitutes are available for all uses of asbestos , and the industry could easily be allowed to wither away . Why then is Canada so fiercely resolved to prop it up ? <p> The answer lies in the symbolic , almost sacrosanct role the fiber plays in the politics of Quebec , where 85 percent of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of a celebrated and bloody strike in 1949 ( ironically , over heal/hand-safety issues ) , where a young lawyer named Pierre Trudeau first made a name for himself defending the workers . Thirty years later , the government of Quebec stepped in to rescue the foundering industry by nationalizing two of the largest mines at the cost of half a billion dollars . Suddenly the cause of asbestos became entwined with the cause of Quebecois nationalism  --  and therefore unassailable . <p> " Quebec politicians were very clever tactically , " says Sentes . " They stated openly a decade ago that if you criticize the Quebec asbestos industry , you are anti-Quebec . Remember that we 're in a constitutional crisis now : People want to hold the country together . Those who would normally be critical of Quebec are biting their tongues . " <p> Shut out of Western markets but immunized against internal criticism , the Canadian asbestos industry set its sights on markets in developing nations . " The time has come , " announced Quebec Asbestos Mining Association President Marcel Dorais in 1980 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort was aided in 1986 by Canada 's coup in persuading the Geneva-based International Labor Organization ( ILO ) to approve a convention endorsing the so-called " controlled use " of chrysotile asbestos , the sort mined in Canada . ( See " Which Bullet to Choose ? " page 65 . ) Since that time , the convention has been ratified by only ten countries ( among them Sweden , which bans asbestos use within its own borders ) . Nevertheless , it has provided a fig leaf of international sanction to Canada 's export efforts . <p> Through trade unions , the Asbestos Institute , and its own embassies , Canada set out to woo the developing world . Canadian unions invited Third World labor leaders to Canada for all-expenses-paid junkets ; the Asbestos Institute held seminars on " controlled use " in 60 countries ; Canadian embassies appointed officers to " manage " asbestos issues and to give away thousands of tons of free samples . Even EPA chief William Reilly did his part , announcing in 1989 that the U.S asbestos ban " should not be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that use of these products should be discontinued . " By the late 1980s sales to the Third World accounted for half of Canadian asbestos exports . ( Much of the rest goes to Japan for processing into building materials , which are then exported to developing nations . ) <p> Helping to finace these sales are both the Canadian International Development Agency and the World Bank . In 1988 the World Bank even joined the Asbestos Institute in hosting a seminar in Washington , D.C. , to promote the use of asbestos-cement pipe , which carries much of the Third World 's drinking water ( a use no longer permitted in the United States ) . " But for the financing of the World Bank , " notes Sentes , " a lot of those countries would not be using asbestos-cement pipe . " David R. Obey ( I ) - Wisc. ) , chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations , protested the bank 's involvement . Writing to Barber Conable , then-president of the World Bank , Obey pointed out that at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several million dollars to remove the asbestos from its own office buildings in Washington , L ) . C. " I think you would agree , " Obey wrote , " that it is unacceptable that U. S. taxpayers ' support of the World Bank should underwrite such a double standard . " Conable refused to halt loans for asbestos-cement projects . <p> Canadian officials aggressively defend their export policy . " We recognize that if there is to be any future to the asbestos industry worldwide , " says the Asbestos Institute 's Gratton , " it has to be through the implementation of safe use . " ( This is an improvement , at Ieast , on the attitude exhibited in a 1977 memo from a salesman for the Carey Canada asbestos firm : " I do not believe that we should raise problems with people who are more primitive than we are or less educated . We can not , in all cases , impose American standards on other people . " ) According to the Institute , asbestos car ' be used in complete safety , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the use of elaborate ventilators and respirators . <p> While there is general agreement that asbestos exposure can be minimized in a modern factory , the sad truth is that industrial-safety standards in the developing world are often notable by their absence . Thailand , for example , imports more Canadian asbestos per capita than any country except Malaysia . But Virah Mavichak , the government official responsible for overseeing hazardous substances , concedes that his country is unprepared to handle asbestos safely . " We do n't have the proper equipment , " he admitted in the fifth estate documentary . " We do n't have the trained people . " <p> " The Canadians expect that they can go to some country , hold a two-day seminar , and then pronounce the country a free-fire zone , " says environmental consultant Castleman . " The burden is on the asbestos industry to demonstrate that it is practical to routinely use asbestos in a thoroughly controlled way in developing countries . " <p> Gratton admits that workplace conditions in the Third World can fall short of ideal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , " he says . " If you have a country or a plant that does n't give a hoot for the protection of its workers , you can not force it to do so . " Indifference to public-health problems abroad , he asserts , is not peculiar to Canada : " That 's why the United States exports so much tobacco to developing countries . " <p> When not on the defensive , the Asbestos Institute sometimes presents its asbestos exports as a lifesaving boon to the Third World . Scott Houston , the institute 's director of regulatory affairs , boasts that " Asbestos-cement products . . . have proven invaluable in furthering public-health objectives , " such as providing communities with fresh drinking water and sewer service at a quarter of the cost of plastic pipe . ( Critics claim that a variety of harmless fibers , including wood fiber , are available for strengthening cement pipe . ) Gratton takes the argument one step further . " The only morally acceptable policy is not to ban it , " he says . " If Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might give Canadians a better conscience , but it would not stop workers from being exposed to the fiber , because it would just come from somewhere else . " <p> That somewhere , it is suggested , would be the Soviet Union , the second-largest exporter of asbestos , with sales of about a third the Canadian total . From what little is known about Soviet export practices , Soviet consciences have no reason to rest easy either . Visitors to Vietnam report " absolutely horrifying " conditions at an asbestos-cement plant there , with workers slicing open bags of Soviet asbestos and dumping them into mixing tanks with no ventilation equipment whatsoever . The only warning on the Soviet sacks is " Use No Hooks . " To further promote asbestos exports , says Gratton , the Soviets and the Canadians have now formed the International Fiber Safety Group " to promote safe use , especially in the developing countries . " <p> Murder is a name we reserve for death death when it is intentional and immediate , when cause and effect are as close as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deed is planned in advance we call it " premeditated , " and consider it especially heinous . Theoretically , the length of time between cause and effect is immaterial ; there is no statute of limitations for murder . <p> Practically , however , the greater the gap , the greater the room for lawyering . Canada sells hundreds of thousands of tons of asbestos to the Third World in full knowledge that years later it will result in thousands of painful deaths . Yet the nation acts as though its responsibility ends with the perfunctory safety seminars provided by the Asbestos Institute . The same denial of responsibility has been the industry 's hallmark since the suppression of the first report on the fiber 's hazards in 1935 . For the Canadian asbestos industry , willful ignorance of the deaths caused by its product has become a way of life . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Joe Darabant : slow death after 30 years on the job . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A Chrysotile asbestos mine in Quebec . The largest of its kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a year ; most of the asbestos extracted is sent to the Third World . Situated on the rim is the town of Asbestos , which is being slowly swallowed by the ever-widening pit . <p> BY PAUL RAUBER <p> <p> PAUL RAUBER is an associate editor of Sierra . <p> WHICH BULLET TO CHOOSE ? <p> January 19 , 1990 , was a happy day for the Canadian asbestos industry : It was the day Science published an article by University of Vermont pathologist Brooke Mossman and others arguing that Canadian asbestos is relatively harmless , and ridiculing public concern over asbestos in schools , homes , and other buildings . The " Mossman paper , " as it came to be known , was eagerly embraced not only by the beleguered asbestos industry , but by insurance and real-estate companies faced with enormous asbestos-removal bills . It pawned a spate of imitators in the popular press , and served as an excuse for school boards and building managers across the country to stop worrying and be happy . <p> Mossman et al . begin by differentiating between good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nasty amphibole asbestos , whose fibers are spiky and rod-like . Canadian chrysotile or " white " asbestos falls into the serpentine class ; the amphibole fibers , crocidolite and amosite ( " blue " and " brown " asbestos , respectively ) , are mined primarily in Africa , and make up only 10 percent of the world asbestos market . <p> Mossman and her colleagues exonerate Canadian asbestos by claiming that the pointy amphibole fibers more readily penetrate the lung cavity , and are thus " the major cause of mesotheliomas in asbestos workers . " The fact that Canadian chrysotile workers also suffer from mesotheliomas is attributed to the small traces of an amphibole fiber called tremolite , which often contaminates chrysotile , ( This is convenient for Mossman 's theory , but offers cold comfort to dying chrysotile workers . ) Since most of the asbestos found in schools and buildings is of the chrysotile variety , the authors find that the " risk from asbestos in buildings is minuscule . . . magnitudes lower than commonplace risks in modern-day society " like accidental drowning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , particularly from scientists associated with the Mt . Sinai Medical Center and Irving Selikoff , who has written extensively on asbestos-related diseases since 1964 . Once the asbestos is inhaled , maintains Selikoff , " very careful studies have been unable to find any real , important difference among the various fiber types . " Even if such a difference could be shown , he says , it would be practically meaningless , given that " most people who 've been exposed have been exposed to more than one type of asbestos . It comes down to this : Would you rather be killed by a silver bullet or a copper bullet ? " Sheldon Samuels , director of health and safety for the AFL-CIO 's Industrial Union Department , wrote to Science to point out " the logn-term asbestos industry association of at least four of the five authors . " ( Morton Corn , for example , one of Mossman 's co-authors , testifies regularly on behalf of asbestos companies . In a recent deposition he revealed that , following publication of the Science article , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plaintiffs ' attorneys and be used against the asbestos industry . ) <p> In presenting her risk-assessment claims , Mossman attacked the straw-man contention that asbestos-related diseases are " hazards to the general population exposed to airborne levels of asbestos in schools and other buildings . " Federal regulations requiring schools to ascertain the scope of their asbestos problems , her article said , were creating a " panic , " often leading to far more serious problems caused by hasty and shoddy removal . <p> No reputable authority , however , advocates removing asbestos from buildings where it has not been damaged or distributed . To the extent that an asbestos panic existed in the late 1980s , it was fueled by unscrupulous removal companies and ignorant media hype . Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly himself wrote to Science to point out that his agency required asbestos to be removed only " when building demolition or renovation threaten to release significant amounts of asbestos fibers into the air . . . If asbestos-containing material is in good condition and is unlikely to be disturbed , it is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Both Mossman 's report and subsequent articles decrying " asbestos panic " miss the fundamental point that asbestos-in-place poses the greatest danger not to casual users of a building , but to the janitors and maintenance personnel who must dust it , patch it , sw throught it , and sweep it off the floor . A Mt . Sinai study of 660 school custodians in New York found that 28 percent of them showed signs of asbestosis ; of those with 35 or more years on the job , 39 percent actually had the disease . <p> " How can we be comfortable about the safety of asbestos when we know that those who use it and those who 've applied it have had the extraordinary cancer experience that we 've seen ? " asks Selikoff . " How we limit it is up to the administrators , the industrial hygienists . But the key is to avoid human exposure . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The results of mesothelioma.Is chrysotile responsible ? <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
